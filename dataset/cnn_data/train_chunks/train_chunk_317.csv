"(CNN) -- As India hosts the world's second largest automobile trade show, its domestic market seems to be having some difficulty getting out of first gear. Car manufacturers from across the world, along with India's homegrown car companies, have descended on New Delhi for the 12th edition of the biannual Auto Expo show. Global manufacturers view the still-modest percentage of car owners as leaving room for long-term growth. Boasting increasing amounts of disposable income, India's emergent middle class is viewed by the global automobile industry as a prize -- something reflected in the international interest in New Delhi. ""India's middle class has been expanding,"" Toshiyuki Shiga, Vice Chairman, Nissan, told CNN. ""They'll increase domestic demand. We'd like to offer our vehicles at reasonable prices."" As the event opens, some eyes are focused on the sports utility market, with Chevrolet's Adra SUV concept and Volkswagen's Taigun, a mini SUV, rumored to be launched at Auto Expo 2014. High-end marques like Jaguar will also be displaying new cars, like its F-Type Coupe. However, it is the sub-four-meter compact sedans that are set to dominate the show this year. New cars for the Indian market aspiring to lure the growing middle classes include the 2014 Hyundai Xcent, Honda Amaze and Maruti Dzire, Ford Figo Concept. These brands will be unveiled at the Expo alongside the domestic Maruti (in partnership with Japan's Suzuki motors), Cerelio -- expected to be the most popular launch of the event -- and Tata's Zest and Bolt hatchback models. With these new models, Tata, the Mumbai-based manufacturer, has undergone some radical overhauls of its design and technology processes -- including the inclusion of the company's Revotron engine -- in a bid to recapture lost market share. ""These cars have been engineered for global markets, through global teams across India, the UK and Korea to set new standards in their respective segments,"" Ranjt Yadav, president of passenger vehicles, Tata Motors, told reporters in Delhi. Hyundai, currently the country's second-largest car manufacturer, will cut export figures to focus more on the domestic market and maintain market share. ""Based on market requirement, we will recalibrate our production between domestic and export market,"" Rakesh Srivastava, Hyundai Motor India's vice-president of marketing and sales, said in an interview with the country's Economic Times. ""Then, whenever there is a need, our investor, our global parent is committed to bringing in additional investment in terms of capacity; but the additional 45,000 units added through re-engineering is enough to meet the demand in the short-term."" As India develops as an economic power and consumers become more sophisticated in their buying habits, analysts say that the automotive industry's growth is slowing down. ""The auto industry is facing significant headwinds on account of rising interest rates, increased fuel prices and reduced share of consumer wallet to discretionary purchases,"" Deepak Gupta, Institutional Equities, Trust Financial Group, told CNN. ""Growth has been tepid in both two- and four-wheelers, and the majority of growth is attributed to entry level vehicles."" The Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) said sales of passenger vehicles declined by 5.72% during April-December 2013, compared to the same period the previous year. India produced 2,029,589 vehicles in the first half of 2013, according to figures released by the International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers, representing an 8.7% decline over the same period the previous year. In comparison, the United States, a country with around a quarter of the population, made 5,665,485. China, by far the world's largest auto producer, manufactured 10,751,683 vehicles in the same period. Gupta says that, while ""major car companies are bullish on India and think the economy could change post-general elections,"" he does not think that the Auto Expo itself will provide an upturn in market sentiment. And while the automobile market might be in danger of stalling, India's sheer numbers mean that there are still thousands of new cars being introduced to India's already-congested roads every day. Delhi recently stole Beijing's crown as the world's most polluted city, and lax environmental standards in domestically produced cars are considered partly to blame for Delhi's poor air quality. Alongside smog caused by traffic, congestion as well as high accident rates and fatalities in India's urban centers mean that cars are an increasing part of the difficulties of life in the subcontinent. Mumbai, the country's financial capital, has attempted to address the issue with the recent addition of a nine-kilometer-long monorail. The line, which opened at the beginning of February, traverses the western Indian city and will offer respite to some commuters  but much of the remainder of the country's public transportation network is antiquated and overburdened, meaning that cars are increasingly the choice of the growing middle class.","The 12th Delhi Auto Expo opens on February 7 .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The female police officer who killed a U.S. contractor in Kabul on Monday is an Iranian national, an Afghan government official said Tuesday. Sediq Seddiqi, an Afghan Interior Ministry spokesman, said the Afghan police officer is an Iranian citizen who met her Afghan husband in Iran. After they eventually went to live in Afghanistan, he managed to help her illegally obtain Afghan citizenship. The United States has long been concerned about Iranian terror-related activity against U.S. targets. But Seddiqi said he doesn't have evidence to link the attacker to militant groups carrying out acts of terror. She was arrested and was questioned, he said. It was the latest in a number of so-called insider attacks by Afghan soldiers and police officers, or attackers dressed like them. More than 50 people have been killed in Afghanistan in similar attacks this year, which the Afghan government calls acts of terrorism. A biannual Pentagon report to Congress this month said there's been an overall increase in insider attacks on U.S. or coalition training forces. Monday's incident marked the first such attack involving a female attacker, said Hagen Messer, a spokesman for NATO's International Security Assistance Force. The victim was identified as Joseph Griffin, 49, of Mansfield, Georgia, according to DynCorp International, which describes itself as ""a global government services provider in support of U.S. national security and foreign policy objectives, delivering support solutions for defense, diplomacy, and international development."" The civilian contractor for the security assistance force was working as an adviser to Afghan police, said Maj. Martyn Crighton, another ISAF spokesman. DynCorp said Griffin had been supporting the Afghan Interior Ministry and Afghan National Police Development Program. Griffin, a veteran of the U.S. military who had served in U.S.-based law enforcement positions, had supported several of the company's global training and mentoring programs since November 2000. He began his most recent assignment in July 2011, DynCorp said. ""Joe spent his career helping people all over the world, most recently working to help the Afghan people secure a better future,"" said Steve Gaffney, chairman and chief executive of DynCorp International. ""The loss of any team member is tragic, but to have this happen over the holidays makes it seem all the more unfair.""","NEW: Attacker met her Afghan husband in Iran, Afghan Interior Ministry spokesman says .

"(CNN) -- America is getting fatter, according to a new report, and bulging waistlines will rack up big health care expenditures within the next two decades. The report, from the Trust for America's Health and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, draws on previously published government data to make predictions about what consequences an upward obesity trend would have for individual states. It also projects that the health of the country -- and the dollars spent on the health care system -- would benefit from even a 5% reduction in the average body mass index. The report is called ""F as in Fat: How Obesity Threatens America's Future 2012."" The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found, in data published in August, that Mississippi is the country's leader in adult obesity, at 34.9%. That number could rise to 66.7% by 2030, the new report found. The new analysis also projected that obesity rates in 13 states could rise above 60% among adults by 2030. By that year, every state in the nation may have adult obesity rates above 44%, including 39 states with rates higher than 50%, the report said. This is consistent with a 2012 study in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, which concluded that by 2030, 42% of adults will be obese. That study forecast $550 billion in health care spending from now to 2030 as a result of rising obesity rates. Just how fat? But some experts are skeptical about how accurately obesity trends can be predicted. Methods of calculating how fat Americans will be in the future vary greatly, and there's no accepted standard of determining it, said David B. Allison, director of the Nutrition Obesity Research Center at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, who was not involved in the new study. ""I don't mean for a moment that we should not be taking steps to reduce obesity,"" Allison said. ""If it increases in prevalence, it would be a more serious problem. And even if it decreases in prevalence, without us intentionally doing anything in the immediate term, I'd be shocked if it's going to vanish."" Interventions intended to reduce obesity should take place regardless of what the projections say the numbers will be in the future, he said. The CDC data indicate that the South is the most obese region of the U.S., but that may not be entirely true either, said George Howard, professor of biostatistics at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. No one was weighed or measured in the collecting of the information; people were merely asked about their heights and weights via telephone -- so they could have lied. Howard speculates that there may be bias in the data because ""there's not a social stigma attached to being fat in the South,"" he said. ""If you ask people how fat they are, they tell you."" Correlations between obesity and the South may be tied to other factors, Allison said. Certain ethnic groups, people from rural areas, and people of low socioeconomic status are more likely to be obese than others. It is not known whether there is a particular reporting bias in the South, or whether lifestyle factors influence obesity there, or if the trend has both components, Allison said. More obesity leads to more disease, and money . For making projections, the new study uses a peer-reviewed model that was used in an analysis of obesity trends in a 2011 article in The Lancet. The Lancet study used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, whereas this one used CDC data. But note that the methodology for the CDC data was different from years past. For the 2011 survey, the CDC included cell phones for the first time. That means trouble for comparisons between this year's results and surveys before it. Authors of the new report noted that in 1995, Mississippi's obesity rate, which led the nation at that time as well, was only 19.4%, and that 20 years ago, no state was above 15%. But these numbers were not determined the same way as the 2011 data. If this report's projections are correct, the disease burden as a consequence is significant. Between 2010 and 2020, new cases of Type 2 diabetes could increase tenfold; so could stroke, coronary heart disease, hypertension and arthritis. The number of cases could double again by 2030, the report said. ""(If) we stay on the current track, we're going to see unacceptably high rates of obesity, and more importantly, unacceptably high rates of diabetes, heart disease, stroke, obesity-related cancers, arthritis, that will really place a huge burden on our health care system,"" said Jeff Levi, executive director of Trust for American Health. Other data have also suggested diabetes increases. A 2010 analysis from UnitedHealth Group's Center for Health Reform and Modernization found that more than half of Americans will have diabetes or pre-diabetes by 2020. The researchers said these diseases will account for nearly $500 billion in total health care spending. Current estimates suggest that the yearly medical cost of adult obesity today is between $147 billion and $210 billion, the study said. The report found that by 2030, an extra $48 billion to $66 billion per year may be spent treating preventable diseases associated with obesity. Interventions . But there is hope, if adults across America would reduce their body mass index, the report said. If the average body mass index were lowered by 5% by 2030, states could save billions of dollars while helping many people. That's the equivalent of a 200-pound, 6-foot-tall person losing 10 pounds. ""We really are looking at two futures for America's health,"" Michelle Larkin, assistant vice president and deputy director for the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Health Group, said at a news conference Tuesday. In this scenario, the report found, more than 100 cases of obesity-related cancer for every 100,000 people would be prevented in all states. Nearly 800,000 Californians would avoid diabetes, and about 660,000 Californians would avoid a stroke or coronary heart disease. And savings in health care costs could be between 6.5% and 7.9% in most states, the report said. The report recommends several policy interventions, such as increasing physical activity in schools, supporting healthy nutrition, putting in place new standards for school meals, and promoting preventive health care services. Larkin highlighted Philadelphia as a city that has shown a commitment to reducing obesity, and where efforts are paying off. A CDC report found that obesity among the city's public school students has declined in recent years, although only from 21.5% to 20.5%. Philadelphia has implemented several initiatives over the last decade aimed at schoolchildren, including removing all sodas and drinks sweetened with sugar from vending machines, offering free breakfast to all students, and getting rid of fryers. The Food Trust, a Philadelphia-based nonprofit group, has been bringing supermarkets to communities that need them and ensuring that food stamps can be used at farmers' markets. ""The city is the first to succeed in reducing disparities in obesity rates,"" Larkin said. ""The city achieved the greatest achievements in (body mass index) among African-American males and Hispanic females, two groups that historically have experienced higher rates of obesity and related health problems."" California, Mississippi and New York City are also starting to show declines in childhood obesity rates, she said.

"San Diego (CNN) -- Kidnapping and murder suspect James DiMaggio, sought in a national manhunt, may be armed with improvised explosives or may have rigged his car with them, San Diego County Sheriff's Department spokeswoman Jan Caldwell said Thursday. ""Working on the theory that he abandoned the car, we think there is a possibility that the car might be rigged,"" Caldwell said. ""So we want to put out there for civilian safety, for officer safety, if you see the car, do not approach it but call law enforcement."" Authorities made the announcement as they search for DiMaggio, who is suspected of abducting as many as two children after killing their mother in a fire. On Wednesday night, Nevada became the fourth state to issue an Amber Alert for the suspected child kidnapper. California, Oregon and Washington also issued the high alert. DiMaggio enjoyed camping and hiking, so ""there is a possibility he could be hunkered down somewhere in a rural area -- not just in southern California but anywhere up and down the state, the Northwest, Canada and down in Mexico,"" Caldwell said. Meanwhile, DiMaggio was described as being so close to the family whose life he allegedly turned upside down that he was considered part of it. DiMaggio came into the lives of Brett and Christina Anderson months before their daughter Hannah, now 16, was born. ""He basically became part of our family,"" Brett Anderson told CNN's Chris Cuomo on Thursday. Now, there is a nationwide manhunt for DiMaggio, who is suspected of kidnapping Hannah Anderson and possibly her brother Ethan, 8. DiMaggio was such good friends with the family that Brett Anderson can't reconcile the man he knows with the crimes he is suspected of. ""I have been through every scenario in my brain,"" Brett Anderson said. ""There was nothing ever to show any indication of this."" DiMaggio joined the family on camp-outs and was always friendly toward them, he said. ""I can't fathom what happened in Jim's head. He obviously just lost it,"" Brett Anderson said. ""You've taken everything,"" the father pleaded to DiMaggio in the interview. ""The damage is done. Just let my daughter go, Let her go home safe, let her be with me and try to mend things from there."" Police seek public help in manhunt . Authorities are counting on the public for clues that may lead them to DiMaggio, 40. ""We've got law enforcement agencies across the country looking for them and following up on tips that are being called in,"" San Diego County Sheriff's Department Lt. Glenn Giannantonio told CNN on Thursday. ""We've received numerous tips, I'd say probably well over 100, possibly hundreds of tips from across the country. Every tip that can be followed up on has been followed up on or is currently being followed up on."" On Wednesday, an Amber Alert was issued in Oregon for Hannah and Ethan. The alert was broadcast after a possible sighting of a vehicle wanted in connection with the case, Oregon police said. San Diego police later said that tip didn't pan out, though Oregon state police said they hadn't heard that. Why more Amber alerts will be waking you up . An arrest warrant for murder has been issued for DiMaggio. In the event of his arrest, a judge has signed off on a $1 million bond, said San Diego County Superior Court spokeswoman Karen Dalton. Remains found after house fire . Also found in the DiMaggio's burned home were charred human remains consistent with those of an 8-year-old child, Giannantonio said. The remains were so badly burned that carrying out a DNA test is proving difficult, he said. It is possible that the remains are those of Ethan, but until there is a positive identification, the sheriff's office is treating him as a missing person. There have been some hints that DiMaggio was traveling to certain areas, but nothing has panned out, Giannantonio said. ""He could be anywhere at this point,"" he said. Brett Anderson said that when he heard that a body was found in DiMaggio's burned-down house, he thought it was DiMaggio who had perished and was sad for him. ""Things just downward spiraled from there,"" he said. DiMaggio was the owner and sole resident of the burned home where Christina Anderson's body and the remains of the child were found. One witness said that DiMaggio had a crush on Hannah, but evidence to corroborate that has not yet surfaced, Giannantonio said. Opinion: Missing persons could be just next door . The remains of Anderson, of Lakeside, California, were found while firefighters extinguished a blaze that broke out at DiMaggio's home in the enclave of Boulevard around 8 p.m. Sunday. Authorities believe she was killed. Her mother, Sara Britt, said Christina Anderson was 44 years old, not 42 as earlier reported. Hannah Anderson was last seen at 3 p.m. Saturday at cheerleading practice, according to Britt and her other daughter, Jennifer Willis. Ethan was supposed to be at football practice at 8 a.m. Sunday but never showed, the two relatives said. Ex-wife: Suspect didn't seem violent . DiMaggio's former wife, who was married to him for only six months, said he didn't show any violent tendencies during that period, but instead was a ""nerdy"" guy who showed a keen interest in video games, in particular, the game ""Everquest."" ""I would complain about the virtual reality game he would play all night. It was ridiculous. It was consuming him. It was addictive,"" the ex-wife, who wished to remain anonymous, told HLN's Nancy Grace. ""He is not a materialistic person, and he's very resourceful,"" she said. The suspect's ex-wife added that she did not believe there was a romantic relationship between DiMaggio and the slain woman, describing their relationship as a ""brother-sister type of deal."" California authorities also issued an Amber Alert. Once they did, information was distributed to residents' cell phones statewide through the Wireless Emergency Alert program, according to the California Highway Patrol. The wireless program was instituted in December 2012, and this was the first time it had been used statewide, Highway Patrol public information officer Erin Komatsubara told HLN. On HLN's ""Raising America"" on Tuesday, the children's aunt, Andrea Saincome, said that DiMaggio had known the family for years and that it would not have been unusual for the mother and children to be at his house. ""There was nothing out of the ordinary,"" Saincome told HLN's Christi Paul. ""He seemed like a genuinely nice guy. He was close to the kids, and he was friends with my sister and my brother-in-law."" Suspect linked to blue four-door car . The sheriff's office released several photos of DiMaggio, and Giannantonio said he was believed to be driving a blue, four-door Nissan Versa with California license plate 6WCU986. However, he might have switched vehicles, taken public transportation or be hunkered down somewhere, Giannantonio said. He asked for the public's help, as did San Diego County Sheriff Bill Gore . ""We need all the eyes and ears out there we can get in trying to find both DiMaggio and hopefully those two kids,"" the sheriff said. ""Citizens should not try to interfere with this person at all. He's already proven he's a pretty dangerous fella."" Anyone with information about the case is asked to call the San Diego County Sheriff's Department Homicide Detail at 858-974-2321 or submit an anonymous tip to Crime Stoppers at 888-580-8477. CNN's Miguel Marquez and HLN's Katherine Cavazini contributed to this report.

"(CNN) -- Some people believed that one of the most democratic ways out of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine was to let people of Crimea decide their fates for themselves through a referendum. But there were a few serious flaws with that ""democratic"" approach. Sunday, March 16, was a day many Ukrainians waited for with concern and dread. Originally, the referendum was planned for May 25, then moved up to March 30 and then once again moved to March 16. Prime Minister Sergey Aksyonov and Vladimir Konstantinov, speaker of Crimean Parliament, were eager to accomplish the task Russian President Vladimir Putin had given them. That task was to provide Russia with some kind of excuse for a military intervention that had in fact started on February 28, when there were reports of Russian soldiers occupying the Crimean Peninsula. Long before the referendum took place, the international community expressed concerns about its legitimacy, and many people in Ukraine considered it illegal. This kind of referendum violates the Ukrainian Constitution, which specifies that it can be done only countrywide. And does this mean that Russia can invade any country where there is a Russian-speaking enclave? Russia even owned Alaska once. Should they get that back, too? Crimea's vote: Was it legal? To no surprise, Aksyonov reported that more than 80% of people in Crimea voted in the referendum and 96% voted for Crimea to join Russia. The results themselves didn't matter, as everybody knew they would be false. There are certainly some people who have been brainwashed by Russian TV channels (Ukrainian stations have been cut off in Crimea) and do believe in lies that in Russia Crimea will be given all kinds of advantages and privileges. But also consider that the vote took place under the guns of Russian troops and residents were given less than two weeks to prepare. It is unsafe to be pro-Ukrainian in Crimea right now, as the region is controlled by Russian military and hired thugs. The announcement of results signaled to the people of Ukraine that a quiet waiting period of our conflict with Russia is probably over. Even though the United Nations, European Union, United States and other international observers do not recognize results of referendum, Russia is still claiming that Crimea will join with them. So the tension has come up to higher levels. The Ukrainian Parliament has announced partial mobilization of army reserves. Annexation of Crimea opportune or opportunistic? My friends and colleagues in Crimea tell me that people are standing in long lines to withdraw money from banks. Many ATMs do not have cash, and stores do not accept credit cards. Retired people are concerned about their pensions being paid on time. Ukrainians are still not sure what their preparations should be. Will our troops try to liberate Crimea from Russian invaders? Will Russian troops try to invade eastern regions of Ukraine where Russian provocateurs have been trying to cause trouble, too? Did Putin set his goals not just for Crimea but the whole of Ukraine? Putin keeps talking about Ukraine as a failed state and the Ukrainian government as not legitimate, though it's recognized by all other countries in the world. The bottom line is this: The referendum is a farce that the whole world has pronounced illegitimate, but it is being used by Putin to escalate conflict to next level. His ambitions for restoring the Soviet Union in the form of a new Russian Empire are no secret. Even Putin's allies, such as Belarus and Kazakhstan, are nervous. It's hard to not be concerned if you live anywhere in Ukraine -- or in Poland, Latvia, Lithuania or Estonia. Are you in Ukraine, Crimea or Russia? Have you witnessed the unrest? What do you think about the region's future? Share your stories with CNN iReport, but please stay safe.

"HAVANA, Cuba (CNN) -- Hundreds of thousands of people packed a main square in the Cuban capital Sunday to witness a rare and ambitious concert that, despite its nonpolitical theme, drew criticism from some Cuban exiles in the United States. Colombian singer Juanes, creator of the ""Peace without Borders"" concert, performs at Sunday's event in Havana. Colombian singer Juanes -- a 17-time Latin Grammy winner -- brought 15 international artists to Havana for Sunday's ""Peace without Borders"" concert. All of the artists wore white as a symbol of peace. ""I can't believe what my eyes are seeing,"" Juanes said on stage, describing the sea of people as a ""beautiful dream."" Sunday's event was Juanes' attempt to connect isolated Cubans with the rest of the region, including the United States. The decades-old U.S. embargo on Cuba is the most visible manifestation of the communist country's political isolation. The crowd cheered when Juanes said, ""We are all brothers, and we all have to be connected."" But the reaction in Miami, Florida, home to both Juanes and a large Cuban exile community, has not been entirely peaceful. Juanes has received death threats over the concert via Twitter, he said, and his home in Miami is under police protection. Some Cuban exiles in Florida have called the concert a declaration of war, smashing his records in a public anti-Juanes demonstration. Juanes sang with Cuban performers barred from visiting the United States, like Silvio Rodriguez. But missing from this concert were Cuban-American performers like Gloria Estefan and Willy Chirino, fierce critics of the Cuban government. ""We asked the government and we asked Willy and we asked Gloria and we tried,"" Juanes said. ""But at this time it's not going to happen. It's not in our hands. But we really tried."" Chirino said Juanes' project will only benefit the Communist authorities. ""The revolution is going to win,"" Chirino said, referring to the government established by Fidel Castro more than 50 years ago. ""An old system that's dying already, you know, they're going to give it oxygen."" Still, Chirino said, he respects Juanes' motives. ""I think Juanes' idea is brilliant and it's full of love. Nobody is against an artist going to a country and bringing his or her work to the people,"" he said. Concert officials said more than 1.1 million people attended Sunday's event, though some other estimates were lower. What seemed certain was that this was the largest staged event at La Plaza de la Revolucion since Pope John Paul II said Mass here in front of an estimated 850,000 people in 1998. The concert was the second ""Peace without Borders"" show. A previous concert in Colombia aimed to ease tensions between that country and neighboring Venezuela. Juanes said the reaction to Sunday's concert neither surprised nor deterred him. ""I mean, we knew that this was going to happen,"" he said in a statement on his Web site. ""I have been living in Miami for seven years, and the first time I visited Miami was 10 or more years ago, so I know what happened in Miami with the Cuba issue and with all these things before [we decided] to go to Cuba to do this event. ""I deeply regret having caused, let's say, this bad moment,"" he said. He said he had spoken to Cuban exile leaders in Miami to explain his motives. Both countries helped him overcome obstacles typical to big, free events staged by foreigners in Cuba -- a lack of visas and expensive sound and stage equipment. He told the official Cuban youth newspaper Juventud Rebelde that he would like to stage the same concert with the same artists in Miami. Thirty-six Cuban dissidents gave their blessing, signing a petition in favor of the concert. ""We think Juanes' initiative is good because it can help bring about national reconciliation and unity among Cubans,"" Castro opponent Oscar Espinosa Chepe said. And Cubans seemed delighted by their first chance in decades to hear international top-caliber Latin stars. CNN's Soledad O'Brien and Shasta Darlington contributed to this report.","Concert appears to be venue's largest staged event since pope's '98 visit .

"(CNN) -- A man who for 20 years has lived near one of six men accused of sexually abusing young relatives said he finds the allegations ""absolutely unbelievable."" Bob Ramsey, a retired Graceland University chemistry professor and David Mohler's neighbor in Lamoni, Iowa, said he knows most of the Mohler family. Burrell Edward Mohler Sr., 77, and his sons Burrell Edward Mohler Jr., 53; David A. Mohler, 52; Jared Leroy Mohler, 48; and Roland Neil Mohler, 47, were arrested Tuesday on suspicion of sexually abusing children. A sixth family member, Darrel Wayne Mohler, 72, was arrested Friday as he pulled into the driveway of his Silver Springs, Florida home. Darrel Mohler, the younger brother of Burrell Edward Mohler Sr., is being held in jail in Marion County, Florida, charged with two counts of rape in a Missouri arrest warrant. The six alleged victims -- all now adults -- came to law enforcement authorities with stories of sexual performances, mock weddings, rape with various objects and a forced abortion during their childhoods, according to court documents obtained by CNN affiliate KSHB in Kansas City, Missouri. None of the accused in the case has entered a plea and it's unclear whether they have legal counsel. ""David was one of the kindest people I know in this town,"" Ramsey said. ""I find it absolutely unbelievable. That's my honest opinion."" Ramsey said he and Burrell Edward Mohler Sr., 77, attended college together 50 years ago. Ramsey said he spent a lot of time with the family because his wife had taught piano to two family members. ""They were in and out of our home quite a bit, and there was absolutely never any indication of abuse,"" he said. The employer of one of the suspects said, ""Everybody is still in shock ... disbelief,"" as news of the arrests spread through communities where several of the suspects live in western Missouri. ""He was a good medic,"" Corbin Allred said of Roland Mohler, who has been employed at Saline County Ambulance District No. 3 since 2006. Mohler has been suspended, Allred said, and further action may be taken at the next board meeting. Allred described Roland Mohler as outgoing and said, ""He blends in with everybody else."" Roland Mohler was on duty when Missouri State Highway Patrol officers arrested him, Allred said. Paramedic Sharon Roscher was also shocked about allegations that one of their own could be involved in something so horrific. ""You eat, you sleep, you do everything with people for 48 hours,"" she said. ""Oh my gosh, it's just a shock."" Roland Mohler's father, Burrell Edward Mohler Sr., also worked for a time in emergency services as a firefighter in Independence, Missouri, the fire department confirmed. A spokesman would not comment further. Burrell Mohler Sr., David Mohler and Jared Mohler are lay ministers in the Community of Christ, the organization said. ""Leaders and members of the Community of Christ in the greater Kansas City area are prayerfully upholding those families that are touched by the recent arrests of five members of the Mohler family,"" the statement said. Lay ministers are volunteers who do not receive compensation, and none of the three served in leadership roles or worked with children, according to the organization, which is based in Independence, Missouri.

Burrell Mohler Sr. did go through the group's registered youth worker program, but ""his youth worker registration has been terminated and we understand he had no contact with children or youth in church programs,"" the church said. Some lay ministers might help take care of the church, Booth said, while others might speak at services. ""Immediately, I went to the rolls and had their priesthoods suspended because that's what we do in the Community of Christ when there's any word of something like this.

It split off from the Mormon church in the 1800s, and in 2000 changed its name to Community of Christ from the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. ""I personally feel grief for these families, all the families that are involved in this,"" Booth said. ""I feel concern for the congregations.""

"(CNN) -- Call it a tech-induced hydrophobia. Consumer electronics and water don't mix, and for many, there are few things more nerve-racking than a smartphone or tablet that's been accidentally doused. A rainy day or a trip to the beach means gingerly baby-sitting our devices. And kitchens and bathrooms are fraught with danger zones: sinks, bathtubs and worse. ""I can't tell you how many people I know who've accidentally dropped their phone in the toilet, or their kid spilled their juice box all over it,"" CNET senior writer Maggie Reardon told CNN. A soaked phone or tablet has traditionally meant shelling out for a costly replacement. But new technology has moved beyond waterproof cases and ""rugged"" cell phones designed to withstand rough conditions. Devices highlighted at this year's Mobile World Congress and Consumer Electronics Show suggest the future is bright for phones and tablets that are both stylish and waterproof -- or at least water-resistant. Sony's Xperia Tablet Z was a hot item at last week's Mobile World Congress because of its sleek design and functionality, with the ability to withstand getting wet a cool add-on. ""If you're having a bath and you really want to enjoy that great movie ... and (the tablet) accidentally falls into the bath, it's OK,"" said Xperia Z product manager Sharath Muddaiah. That level of waterproofing is already incorporated in a few Sony smartphones such as the Acro S and Advance, and most recently with the Xperia Z. The Xperia Z's makers said it can withstand sprays of water -- such as sprinkler play on a lawn or a water fight. They even claim it can be dunked in up to 3 feet of water for up to 30 minutes. There's no specific or special coating on the device, Muddaiah said. Rather, the device is made water-resistant in all of its parts without the stereotypically bulky design for which so-called rugged phones have been known. ""We see today that a lot of consumers would like to use their device in the rain -- say you're trying to using Google Maps and navigating,"" Muddaiah said. Or ""you're out at the pub and someone accidentally spills their drink. If that's the case, you can just rinse the device under a tap of water."" However, Sony cautions that the device's port covers need to be sealed up tight for its claim to ... well, hold water. The phone's micro-SIM slots, micro-USB and headphone sockets all have little rubber-lined port covers -- sort of like the gas tank cover on a car -- that must be flipped out for access, as Engadget noted in its review of the Xperia Z phone. Sony isn't alone in efforts to provide a sturdier smartphone. China's Huawei submerged its Ascend D2 phone for the benefit of attendees at the Mobile World Congress, and Kyocera added a water-resistant Hydro smartphone to its line last summer. Motorola also has options for the water wary, such as the RAZR M, RAZR HD and the RAZR Maxx HD. Hottest gadgets at world's biggest mobile technology show . ""We use a splash-guard coating on our phones to help with the accidental coffee spill or when you get caught in the rain,"" a spokeswoman for the company told CNN. A second rep described it as ""hydrophobic nano-coating,"" which ""permeates into the device to repel water"" and also protects the electrical boards inside. That said, the rep added, ""you shouldn't submerge the phone."" Other companies trying to solve tech's liquid-incompatibility problem repeat the same mantra: Water-resistant features are there to help in case of accidents, not to make a phone safe for scuba diving. A startup called Liquipel offers a liquid-repellent coating, now in its second generation, that encases electronics to keep them dry. The company said its coating can hold up against use in heavy rain or a surprise dunking. The downside: It costs at least $60, and you must part with your phone for several days while Liquipel applies the coating and then ships it back to you. Its effectiveness has been up for debate as curious testers have posted a range of online reviews -- both positive and negative . Where Liquipel sells to consumers, companies such HzO and P2i are focusing on incorporating their waterproofing technology in products before they're shipped out. The liquid-repellent coating developed by P2i can be found on the Alcatel One Touch 997, whereas HzO just announced a partnership with Atelier Haute Communication to apply its waterproofing technology to a forthcoming limited edition TAG Heuer Android phone. While P2i describes its invisible ""hydrophobic layer"" as covering the exterior and interior of a product, HzO touts what it calls ""WaterBlock"" technology, which is applied to the internal circuitry of a device to protect it from moisture. How mainstream water-resistant features become will likely depend on demand, said CNET's Reardon. ""Some of these fringe guys, like Kyocera and Sony, are seeing an opportunity that the average consumer wants some of those features, too. You can see it because of the massive market for cases and accessories to keep these devices shock-proof and also water-resistant,"" Reardon said. The real question, she said, is whether we'll start to see top manufacturers such as Apple adding the feature to their products. ""I'm not sure if we're going to see that immediately,"" Reardon said, ""but it wouldn't surprise me if in a couple of years this became a more standard feature on devices."" In the meantime, there's always that low-tech fix if your beloved device has gone for an unplanned swim: Find a bowl and pick up a bag of rice.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- When U.S. citizen Edward Snowden decided to flee to Hong Kong because of its ""spirited commitment to free speech and the right of political dissent,"" he may not have anticipated that some in the city would launch a protest backing him. Several hundred demonstrators took to Hong Kong's streets in the rain Saturday voicing support for Snowden a week after the 29-year-old computer technician, who is believed to be hiding out somewhere in the city, revealed himself as the source of leaked documents exposing an international surveillance program of internet and telephone communications operated by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA). The revelation of his presence -- as well as his claims that Hong Kong had been subject to the surveillance -- has sparked heated speculation whether Hong Kong, a special administrative region -- one that is semi-autonomous -- of the People's Republic of China, would prove to be a safe haven for him. Snowden said his intention was to ""ask the courts and people of Hong Kong to decide my fate."" ""We're rallying in order not to disappoint him and to ask Hong Kong to protect his well-being, not to extradite him, and to uphold Hong Kong law,"" said blogger, activist and protest organizer Tom Grundy. Amid the blowing of whistles and chants of ""Protect Snowden!"" and ""NSA has no say!"" the protest brought together representatives from 27 civil rights, labor rights, and left-wing democratic groups, as well as many ordinary members of the public as well as media. Under the drizzling sky, protesters determined to show their support held laminated placards and umbrellas painted with slogans. Adi Koul and Jesus Meza, students from the University of Texas at Austin who are studying abroad in Hong Kong, said they found the protest ""really refreshing."" ""As Americans, it's kind of disheartening to know [the surveillance program] is going on behind our backs and we don't have a say in it,"" said Koul. ""It's empowering to see people who aren't necessarily American fighting for something they feel is a universal human right."" Ruth Jopling brought her daughters, Amber, aged eight, and three-year-old Jade, along to the protest; the children held cut-out masks on sticks bearing Snowden's image. ""It's not just about our generation, but the next generation as well,"" Jopling said. Amber echoed her mother's sentiment: ""When I grow up, I can tell my children about this."" Organizers claimed an overall turnout of 900 protesters; police said the demonstration had a peak turnout of 300 -- a relatively small showing compared to major protests in Hong Kong, which have attracted hundreds of thousands of people. Grundy said plans for the protest only began on Monday, and that he would be pleased if 1,000 people turned out in the end. The three-hour protest, which kicked off in a garden in the city's business district and went on to the U.S. consulate and the Hong Kong government headquarters, failed to gain a strong sense of momentum, hampered in part by the narrow looping route allocated by the city's authorities. At each rallying point, only a small group was able to gather around to hear the keynote speakers; most protesters were relegated to standing single or double file some distance away. By the time the protest moved outside the government headquarters to deliver an open letter to the city's leader, Chief Executive C.Y. Leung, the crowd had dropped to about 100 people. Snowden's arrival in the city has heightened simmering fears about the ever-encroaching hand of Beijing in the city's affairs and freedoms. While Hong Kong has its own de facto constitution, judiciary, and legal system under the ""one country two systems"" policy, a deep mistrust runs in the city toward the government under Leung, who is widely viewed as being under the thumb of the Chinese central government. In a televised interview with Bloomberg Wednesday, Leung repeatedly insisted he ""does not comment on individual cases,"" when asked how Hong Kong would handle Snowden's case. His stonewalling infuriated many Hong Kongers. ""Judging from [this interview], I think he's waiting for instructions from Beijing,"" said Oiwan Lam, a blogger and activist with in-media, the civil advocacy group that organized the protest with Grundy. According to Hong Kong law, if the U.S. was to request the city to surrender Snowden, Beijing could step in only if its defence or foreign affairs would be significantly affected by Hong Kong's actions. Beijing is not allowed to interfere with any asylum proceedings. Nevertheless, many have expressed fears that Beijing will quietly influence Hong Kong's handling of Snowden's case. ""Hong Kong's decisions are all based on the Chinese government,"" said Sherry Hung, 24, a graduate student at Hong Kong Baptist University. ""I don't think Hong Kong can help Snowden,"" she added, although she said it was important to show her support at the protest. Others also note that Hong Kong has a track record of cooperating with the United States. In particular, they fear Hong Kong will not respect due process in the Snowden case, instead enabling him to be quietly whisked away. Local media in Hong Kong last year reported on the case of a Libyan dissident who launched legal action against the city's government, accusing them of aiding in his ""extraordinary rendition"" and subsequent torture in prison. ""The biggest Western government -- the U.S government -- is his enemy. Now he can only count on us, the power of Hong Kong civil society and our legal system,"" Ip Lam Chong of in-media told protesters. ""I see this incident as a stress test for Hong Kong society and its legal system."" Claudia Mo, a member of the Hong Kong legislature who addressed the protesters, said the city of Hong Kong ""owes Snowden at least some response."" ""The U.S is supposed to be the champion of democracy, but it's been conducting blanket surveillance on a global scale,"" she said. ""If the guy at the top has access to all our lines of communication, how is... anyone ever going to start a revolution?""","Several hundred protesters took to Hong Kong's streets Saturday to support Edward Snowden .

"(CNN) -- Japan deployed missile-defense systems at three sites around Tokyo early Tuesday ahead of a possible missile launch by North Korea, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said. The Patriot missile batteries were set up in the central district of Ichigaya and in the suburbs of Asaka and Narashino, Suga told reporters Tuesday. The deployments come as U.S. and South Korean officials warn Pyongyang could be preparing for another provocative move after weeks of belligerent rhetoric. Suga had said Monday that the Japanese government would not publicize any missile-defense deployment, saying ""It would show our strategy to North Korea."" The comments came a day after North Korea said it would pull out all its workers and temporarily suspend operations at the industrial complex it jointly operates with the South, the latest sign of deteriorating relations on the Korean Peninsula. The North said it would also consider permanently closing down the Kaesong Industrial Complex, a shared manufacturing zone that is the last major symbol of cooperation between the two countries. On Tuesday morning, the South Korean Unification Ministry said North Korean workers hadn't so far reported for work. The deteriorating situation in Kaesong came after the South Korean government had briefly caused concern about the prospect of a new North Korean nuclear test. South Korea's Unification Minister Ryoo Kihl-jae's office clarified his earlier statements in the day about North Korea's nuclear test plans by saying the North had been ""continuously preparing"" for another nuclear test since February, and that there hadn't been any new signs. There was some confusion that earlier comments may have suggested new information indicating the North's nuclear test plans -- something that could have ratcheted up tensions with North Korea. The minister's office made clear that this was not his intended meaning. Opinion: An accident, then war with North Korea? But the crisis at the joint industrial complex provided a tangible sign of the North's provocative stance. In a statement carried by the official North Korean news agency, Kim Yang Gon, secretary of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, accused the South of seeking ""to turn the zone into a hotbed of war"" against the North. Pyongyang was already preventing South Korean workers and managers from entering the complex, which sits on the North's side of the militarily fortified border, and threatened to shut it down entirely amid its recent stream of verbal broadsides against Seoul and Washington. The South Korean Unification Ministry wasn't immediately able to confirm whether the North had actually begun withdrawing its more than 50,000 workers from Kaesong yet. If Pyongyang follows through on its declaration, the move could be financially costly, since Kaesong is considered to be an important source of hard currency for Kim Jong Un's isolated regime. The ban on the entry into the zone of new workers and trucks was already putting a strain on personnel and supplies for the scores of South Korean companies operating there, prompting more than 10 of them to cease production. Does North Korea think U.S. going soft? A torrent of threats . North Korea has issued a catalog of alarming threats against the South and the United States in the past several weeks, sharpening its rhetoric after the U.N. Security Council imposed stricter sanctions for Pyongyang's latest underground nuclear test, which took place it February. The strong words have put the region on edge. Seoul said Sunday that it believed Pyongyang could conduct a missile test this week after recently moving the necessary components to the coast. Analysts had said at the time of the February nuclear test that the North might follow up with another detonation soon afterward as it tries to push forward its nuclear program that it says it needs as a deterrent to protect it from the United States. Explore more on North Korea . A delicate situation . The North rattled the region last week by saying it would restart a shuttered nuclear reactor and block South Koreans from entering the Kaesong complex. Reports then emerged late in the week suggesting the North had loaded as many as two medium-range missiles onto mobile launchers on the east coast ahead of a possible test firing. And the South Korean president's office said Sunday it believed a missile launch could happen around Wednesday. The North frayed nerves further by warning foreign diplomats inside the country that if war breaks out, it cannot guarantee their safety. The string of troubling announcements from Pyongyang followed weeks of menacing rhetoric, which included the threat of a nuclear strike on South Korea and the United States. Observers say they believe North Korea is still years away from having an operational nuclear missile, but they note it does have conventional weapons that pose a threat to countries in the region like South Korea and Japan, both of which are home to thousands of U.S. troops. North Korea: Who's in the crosshairs? Sanctions and drills . The escalation in verbal threats from the North coincided with the tougher U.N. sanctions last month and the annual joint military exercises in South Korea by U.S. and South Korean forces, drills that have aggravated Pyongyang in previous years. The United States initially responded to the North's invective by publicly drawing attention to its shows of military force in the training exercises, including the flight of nuclear-capable B-2 stealth bombers over South Korea. But when those moves appeared to further infuriate rather than intimidate Pyongyang, raising worries that they increased the risk of a miscalculation in the crisis, Washington dialed back the displays of strength. On Saturday, a senior U.S. Department of Defense official said a long-planned missile test in California, scheduled for Tuesday, was being delayed to avoid any misperceptions by North Korea. And in a sign of the delicate situation in the region, Gen. James Thurman, the top U.S. commander in South Korea, canceled a trip to Washington this week ""as a prudent measure,"" a U.S. military spokesman said Sunday. Thurman was due to testify before the Senate Armed Services Committee and the House Armed Services Committee. Possible explanations . Analysts have attempted to explain the North's unnerving behavior by suggesting it may be an effort by Kim, who inherited power from his father less than a year and a half ago, to shore up domestic support, particularly with the military. Another theory is that Pyongyang is trying to secure direct negotiations with Washington, something the United States has long shunned in favor of multilateral talks. The North Korean regime's recent words and actions appear to be increasingly troubling its key ally, China. The new Chinese President Xi Jinping, appeared to make an unusual veiled rebuke of North Korea on Sunday. ""Countries, whether big or small, strong or weak, rich or poor, should all contribute their share in maintaining and enhancing peace,"" Xi said at an international conference, the Chinese state-run news agency Xinhua reported. No one should be allowed to throw a region into chaos for selfish gains, he said, according to Xinhua. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, who will visit Asia this week, is expected to discuss potential diplomatic incentives for North Korea once it stops its threatening rhetoric, senior administration officials told CNN on condition of anonymity. ""Secretary Kerry agrees that we have to have a robust deterrent because we really don't know what these guys will do,"" said one senior official, who was not authorized to speak on the issue. ""But he also knows that the North Koreans need a diplomatic off-ramp and that they have to be able to see it."" CNN's Yoko Wakatsuki, Tim Schwarz, K.J. Kwon, Judy Kwon, Ben Brumfield, Josh Levs, Chris Lawrence, Barbara Starr, Kyung Lah and Jim Clancy contributed to this report.","NEW: Japan deploys Patriot missile batteries around Tokyo .

"(CNN) -- ""Dr. Youn, my daughter is so ugly."" A Korean mother in her 50s sits before me in the exam room, her teenage daughter next to her. ""You need to fix her ugly nose, open up her eyes and give her a double fold of her eyelids,"" the woman says. ""Okay,"" I look at her daughter. ""Jane, what do you think? Is this something you want?"" Jane stares at the floor, unmoving. Then she speaks, eyes still looking downward. ""I guess. Whatever my mom says."" Plastic surgery is hot in Asia. One in five South Korean women from 19 to 49 have undergone cosmetic surgery, according to a 2009 survey from market-research firm Trend Monitor. That's reportedly compared to about one in 20 in the United States. Visit the world's plastic surgery capital . Although the United States and Brazil are the top two countries in sheer number of plastic surgeries performed, China and Japan are numbers three and four, according to the International Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons. South Korea, with a population of almost 49 million, is ranked seventh. Asian culture has embraced cosmetic surgery. Unlike in the United States, it's no longer considered taboo to admit to having been nipped and tucked, even among celebrities. Miss South Korea 2012 confessed to having gone under the knife, revealing, ""I never said I was born beautiful."" Interestingly, I find that the older generation often pushes younger people to have work done. I've met several Korean parents in their 50s and older like Jane's mom who have no qualms about encouraging their children to undergo plastic surgery. They even poke and prod at their kids' faces to suggest how a surgeon should improve their looks. The majority of facial cosmetic operations performed on Asians are considered ""Westernizing"" procedures. Two of the most popular, nose jobs (rhinoplasty) and eyelid lifts (blepharoplasty), are specially designed to make these features look more Caucasian. 2011: Plastic surgery boom as Asians seek 'Western' look . Asians generally have wider and flatter noses. Asian rhinoplasty narrows the nose and makes it project more, similar to a European look. Asian blepharoplasty creates an extra fold in the upper eyelid. While present in nearly all Caucasians, this extra fold occurs naturally in only 15% of East Asians. While Asian plastic surgeons claim that these procedures are meant to retain their patients' ethnicities and make them generally more attractive, I don't buy it. To put it bluntly: Facial plastic surgery on Asians is about making a person look as Caucasian as possible. And that's a disturbing thought. Full disclosure: As a young plastic surgeon, I trained in these types of procedures. I even performed a handful of them in my early practice. As a hungry young surgeon, I had no qualms about performing operations such as double eyelid surgery. The ethics of whether these procedures were right or wrong never really crossed my mind. And then a string of events caused me to reconsider whether I should continue to perform these operations. Are these surgeries really the right thing for patients? For society? First, I encountered Jane and her mother. Then, I received a request from a mom to perform an Asian eyelid surgery on her son. ""He really wants the surgery done,"" the mother said. ""He wants to look handsome."" Then I found out her son was only 8. And I had a daughter. The most beautiful girl I've ever seen -- perfect in every way. She looks just like her mother, except for one feature that she's inherited from her daddy. She has no fold of her upper eyelids. And I hope she never feels the need to change that. What do you think? If you're Asian, have you considered these types of procedures? Is it wrong for Asians to idealize stereotypical Caucasian features?

"(CNN) -- All day long, Lucia looked forward to her favorite weekday ritual: putting the kids to bed, changing her clothes, and pouring herself a generous glass of Pinot Noir. ""My friends and I joke that motherhood 'drives us to drink,' but sometimes it really does for me,"" she said. ""I feel like I need it to unwind,"" she said. Most nights she had three or four glasses, though never, she insisted, more than that. ""And on nights that I don't have it,"" she said, ""I really wish that I did."" For a long time, Lucia saw nothing wrong with her drinking. It didn't interfere with her parenting, or her relationships. She got done what she needed to get done. But lately, Lucia had been starting to wonder about her daily habit -- looking as forward to it as she did, and the anxiety that consumed her when she could not have it left her feeling unsettled. Part of her concern related to a history of alcoholism in her family. ""My father was an alcoholic, and I always have in the back of my head this idea that I could become one, too; it's in my genes,"" she said. Although men have historically been heavier drinkers than women, there is plenty of evidence to suggest that the gender gap is shrinking, and fast. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more American women are drinking more heavily than ever before: one in eight women binge drink -- defined as four drinks or more in one sitting -- about three times a month. A forthcoming study in the October 2013 issue of the journal Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research found that college-aged women are drinking more often than their male counterparts, confirming a January 2013 study of college students in Spain found female students were more likely to binge drink than male students. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports that arrests for women driving while drunk are on the rise, by about 30% from 1998 to 2007. And according to the CDC, white, college-educated woman ages 18 to 24 with $75,000 or more annual household income were more likely to binge drink than women of other races, ages, and socioeconomic categories. Part of this rise in alcohol consumption may have something to do with young people staying single longer; presumably women are out socializing more often than women their age were likely to do 20 years ago. They're also working more, and drinking is often part of the job in male-dominated industries, like banking and tech. A study that appeared in the December 2011 issue of Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research, which tracked alcohol consumption in those born after World War II, suggested that the move toward gender equality may correlate with higher drinking rates. This suggests that more women have the opportunity, and the pressure, to socialize for work and ""drink like men."" After all, although the three-martini lunch is a ""Mad Men""-era relic, alcohol undoubtedly still plays a key role in many work functions. Entertaining clients is one way colleagues compete, while after-work socializing is an ever-important part of the professional culture. Many who don't participate in the interoffice networking often feel left out of the group, or even suffer professionally. And yet women with careers aren't the only ones getting a bigger buzz than ever before. A University of Cincinnati study found that, surprisingly, married women actually drink slightly more than their single counterparts. Sarah, a stay-at-home mother, began to drink more frequently after having her third child. She was often drinking alone, because her husband traveled a lot for work. ""My social life is just so restricted; I'm home every night,"" she said. ""I used to have an active social life. Now, most of my evenings are about feeding kids, cleaning kids, putting them to bed -- and then collapsing in front of the TV."" Sometimes, she said, having a drink was a way to remember some of the excitement of her old life. Other times, it was just something to do. Sarah certainly isn't unique and, in fact, there's been a movement toward a certain acceptance -- in some cases even glorification -- of mothers who drink. Popular Facebook groups like ""Moms Who Need Wine"" and ""OMG I So Need a Glass of Wine or I'm Going to Sell My Kids"" have tens of thousands of fans, inspiring one winemaker to create a label of wine especially for stressed-out moms. ""Put your kids to bed,"" the label for MommyJuice Wines reads, ""and have a glass of Mommy Juice."" Though meant, as a concept, to relieve mothers of the pressure to be perfect, the promotion, even half-seriously, of alcohol as an escape, something deserved as a reward for a long day of parenting, has helped make evident the biggest issue of all: That many women don't realize what problem drinking looks, or feels, like. Like Lucia, many problem drinkers will never find themselves hitting ""rock bottom"" or facing any sort of trouble. Instead, they may experience far more prosaic effects, which prevent them, and their family and friends, from recognizing their over-consumption. A recent UK study of more than 22,000 people published in the European Journal of Public Health found that the average woman underreports her weekly drinking by 60%, and that up to 80% of women exceed the recommended daily intake. Are they alcoholics? It's hard to say. But if you believe that alcoholism is defined by a preoccupation with drinking, a steady increase in the amount you need to drink in order to get the same effect, and an inability to give it up -- and most in the medical profession do -- then more and more women fit the profile quite nicely, though often come to the realization on their own. ""My husband only ever commented on the number of bottles in the recycling,"" said Lucia, who eventually quit drinking altogether. ""He'd be like, 'You drank all that? But you weren't drunk at all!' Except, looking back, I sort of was."" The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Peggy Drexler.","Women talk to Peggy Drexler about needing to drink to unwind after day with kids or work .

"(CNN) -- If you're a ""zombie aficionado,"" a ""Web marketing guru"" or a ""social media evangelist,"" you may be doing Twitter wrong. The 160-character Twitter bio, your introduction to the site's nearly 250 million active users, has been called a ""postmodern art form"" by The New York Times. But for most of us, it's a bit simpler than that. It's a digital calling card, a way to sum up our very essence within Twitter's 160-character limit and, presumably, tell people why they might want to follow us. So how did there end up being so many self-proclaimed ninjas, mavens, rock stars, gurus and experts on the site? Those terms, often delivered in a series of short, punchy sentences, have become copycat cliches in the Twitter age. And as Josh Schultz sees it, they're worthy of parody. ""I'd noticed that a lot of Twitter bios tended to be pretty samey,"" said Schultz, a Web developer and creator of the Twitter Bio Generator. ""When that occurred to me, I crawled the bios of all my Twitter acquaintances and saw that ... yep ... some patterns were used a lot."" His generator is a jokey tool that mashes together a bunch of overused words and phrases, creating bios that will look impressively familiar to most Twitter users: ""Professional zombie geek."" ""Unapologetic Internet maven."" ""Social media evangelist."" ""Coffee guru."" It's no accident that a lot of the phrases come off as blatantly self-promotional. ""This was early Twitter days, when it seemed like half the folks using the service were self-described 'social media experts,' "" Schultz said. ""Plenty of the rest of us were of the opinion that those folks might benefit from taking themselves a bit less seriously. So if the generator came across as poking a little fun at them, I'd be OK with that."" Schultz isn't the only one who thought that overdone bio style needed a little skewering. This month, digital media marketing publication Digiday worked up a similar, if significantly more profane, version called ""What the F--- is my Twitter Bio?"". (Fair warning: Lots of profanity. As if the name didn't give that away.) ""The idea was meant to be a way for people to realize the ridiculous lengths others -- and, alas, themselves -- go to to craft their Twitter bio as neatly and perfectly as a Wes Andersen movie,"" Digiday staffer Jack Marshall said in a blog post. Digiday's combination of about 300 words and phrases renders bios largely similar to Schultz's generator: ""Bluetooth pundit."" ""Tech warlock."" ""Interwebz scholar."" Some tweak another bio that's become commonplace: A series of factual information followed by a final zinger to show that you're a serious person -- just not *that* serious. If users don't like the result, they can click a reliably foul-mouthed link to try again. Some of the results also play on Twitter users' seemingly limitless fondness for bacon and booze in their bios. So, if being a bacon buff or beer trailblazer won't necessarily make for a great bio, what will? Schultz says just be yourself. ""It's an honest reflection of what you're going to be tweeting about,"" he said. ""For some people, that will be the sort of straightforward list thing the Twitter Bio Generator pokes a little fun at. For others, it'll be something more abstract or poetic. Maybe they're more abstract or poetic people, harder to pin down."" Writing for Mashable, a CNN content partner, Amy-Mae Elliott offered a few suggestions of her own. -- Your bio is searchable, so make sure it includes keywords about what you tweet about. -- Avoid those generator-style cliches. -- Double-check your spelling and grammar. -- Look at other bios and imitate the style of the ones you like. ""Most importantly,"" she wrote, ""use your bio to let people know what you're going to bring to their Twitter streams -- how following you is going to enrich their Twitter experience."" Of course, as with many things, if you're famous some rules don't apply to you. Does Shaquille O'Neal really need to let you know he was a basketball player? And if you're considering following Conan O'Brien or Jimmy Fallon, there's a pretty good chance you already knew they were talk show hosts. The creative freedom in being famous has led to some of our favorite bios: . Oscar-winning actor Kevin Spacey: ""Former shoe salesman now making a go at film and theater. Wish me luck... "" Actress Ellen Page: ""I am a tiny Canadian."" Comedian Will Arnett: ""Jason Bateman's sponsor"" Jason Bateman: ""Friend of Will Arnett's."" The Twitter bios of some celebs, like Oprah and Kanye West, go one step further -- they're blank. She's Oprah! What more can you say? And then there's Hillary Clinton.

"(CNN) -- British Transport Police said Tuesday they found a stolen 300-year-old Stradivarius violin worth more than $1 million, along with two bows valued at more than $105,000. Police released few details about how they found the items that were stolen in late 2010 near a London train station. They were found at a house in central England. The violin was recovered intact with some very minor damage, they said. ""We're delighted to have recovered the violin after a long and very complex investigation,"" said Detective Chief Inspector Simon Taylor, who led the hunt. He said members of other police forces, an insurance company, and antique dealers helped with the investigation. Two teenagers were arrested and sentenced in 2011 in connection with the theft of the 1696 Stradivarius. The violin's owner, acclaimed violinist Min Jin Kym, noticed her case containing the violin and bows was missing and called police. She said she thought about the theft every day, even in her dreams, and was elated to learn it was found. Stradivarius violins were made by the world's most celebrated violin maker, Antonio Stradivari, in the 1600s. It is thought that from 1666, the Cremona, Italy-born Stradivari made 1,116 instruments, of which more than 600 are still in existence, including violas, cellos, mandolins and guitars. During the 18th century, his unrivaled reputation extended throughout Europe where his instruments were coveted by royalty, aristocracy, church dignitaries and top musicians because of the extraordinary sound they were capable of producing. Stradivari made his last violin in 1737 when he was 92. Experts: Bob Dylan's long-lost guitar finally found .

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- She's a top corporate executive, she leaves work every day at 5:30 p.m. so she can have dinner with her kids, and now Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg is here to help working moms figure out how to follow her successful model. Not surprisingly, Sandberg's effort to lead a new feminist movement among working professional mothers -- outlined in her new book ""Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead,"" and her accompanying online campaign -- has triggered a debate: . Is a high-powered executive who earns more than $30 million a year the best person to advise other working moms on how to advance their careers? TIME.com: Excerpt from Sandberg's book . Maria Kefalas -- a university professor, author and married mother of three -- can trace a lot of similarities between her career and Sandberg's, without the multimillion dollar salary, of course. Like Sandberg, Kefalas achieved amazing career successes while balancing a busy family life by the time she reached her early 40s. ""My career had been so important to me, so central to my life,"" said Kefalas, a self-described ""recovering supermom."" ""I wrote three books, was a full professor at 42 and was successful in my field."" Gallery: Brilliant women, then and now . Last summer, everything changed. Her husband had just spent a rough year undergoing chemotherapy for cancer when her youngest daughter was diagnosed with a serious illness. Kefalas, like many other working parents, had a choice to make: go for a big promotion or spend more time with her ailing daughter. It was a no-brainer, she said. ""In a second, it all evaporated and it was gone,"" she said, of advancing her career. ""And I didn't give a rat's ass."" Overscheduled kids, anxious parents . Today, Kefalas is a sociology professor at Saint Joseph's University in Philadelphia and director of the university's Richard Johnson Center for Anti-Violence. Her schedule allows her to spend her precious time with her family, something she might have given up if she had pursued that promotion. She said she believes the ""dramatic and tragic"" story of why she ""had to stop moving up the academic ladder"" speaks to the real world obstacles that working mothers face all the time. That's something that Kefalas said Sandberg's good fortune and financial resources have allowed her to escape. Work and family: How do you and your partner make it work? ""All mothers have to make choices and we're judged differently,"" she said. ""The choices for working mothers are more costly than it is for men. ""And until that changes, you'll having women opting out."" 'Lean in' or 'wise up'? Sandberg's mission is to help create more female business leaders like herself. She believes women can do that by taking charge of their careers, to ""lean in"" rather than ""pull back"" when facing obstacles, she wrote in her book, which will be released on Monday. ""Women rarely make one big decision to leave the workforce. Instead, they make a lot of small decisions along the way,"" Sandberg wrote, according to a book excerpt on Time.com. ""A law associate might decide not to shoot for partner because someday she hopes to have a family. A sales rep might take a smaller territory or not apply for a management role. A teacher might pass on leading curriculum development for her school. ""Often without even realizing it, women stop reaching for new opportunities."" That, she said, has resulted in what she calls a stalled revolution for all women. ""A truly equal world would be one where women ran half of our countries and companies and men ran half of our homes,"" she wrote. She's not just interested in selling books, either. Sandberg's Lean In campaign promises to support women through community, education and small groups by offering ""ongoing inspiration and support to help them achieve their goals."" ""Women are held back by many things, including bias and lack of opportunity,"" Sandberg said in her ""Welcome to Lean In"" video, adding ""We also hold ourselves back."" In her book, Sandberg outlined three things women can do to further their careers: don't slow down their career before deciding to start a family, let go of unattainable goals, and make sure their colleagues are aware when women are held to different standards than men, particularly when women succeed. The book hadn't even hit the shelves before everyone from every corner started weighing in (check out Time's full coverage here). Sandberg's push to get women into the corner office and at the conference table fails to take into account that not everyone is ""superhuman and rich,"" as Anne-Marie Slaughter, a Princeton professor and former senior adviser to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, wrote in Fortune Magazine . Kefalas said it a little more succinctly: Sandberg lives in a fantasy world. ""We don't live in a vacuum,"" she said, ""Maybe Sheryl does, but not the rest of us."" She works hard for the money . Put aside Sandberg's dream of more women reaching the top rungs of the corporate ladder for a moment. Statistics indicate that women still have a lot of barriers to just earning pay equal to that of their male counterparts. Today, more than seven out of 10 mothers taking care of children are in the labor force, and nearly half of all married couples are dual breadwinners, according to Pew Research Center data from 2010. Time.com: Pay gap not as bad as you think . Still, the public remains conflicted about the impact working mothers have on their young children, with only 21% of Americans saying it's a good thing. ""The cultural story of good mothering has not been reconciled yet to reflect working women,"" Kefalas said. ""There are social rules and the standards are very demanding."" There is a structural reality that women live in, and there's a story women tell themselves about their lives -- a story that is impossible to live up to, Kefalas said. ""There is no way to have it all."" Sandberg agrees. The book excerpt says women should ""stop trying to have it all."" It also acknowledges the ""sacrifices and hardships"" that are tougher today ""because of the expansion of working hours."" But according to the Facebook executive, that doesn't mean working moms should give up on their careers. ""If more women lean in, we can change the power structure of our world and expand opportunities,"" she wrote. ""Shared experience forms the basis of empathy and, in turn, can spark the institutional changes we need. More female leadership will lead to fairer treatment for all women."" Sounds easy enough, right? Not so fast, Kefalas said. ""At the end of the day, we make choices about the kind of people we want to be, and it's so much more than self-sabotaging.""

"(CNN) -- Slightly smaller than the U.S. state of Indiana, and with a slowly decreasing population of just under 10 million (1.7 million of whom live in the capital, Budapest), Hungary is a land in thrall to its history. The horse is still revered here, Franz Liszt is huge and goulash is a soup not a stew. You may find yourself overtaken in a revolving door, but you'll be made to feel thoroughly welcome -- as long as you don't clink your beer glass. More: Guide to Hungary's signature dishes . 1. It has Central Europe's largest lake . At almost 80 kilometers (50 miles) long, and covering an area of almost 600-square-kilometers (230 square miles), Lake Balaton is so big it's known as the ""Magyar tenger"" or the Hungarian Sea. The lake is a favorite vacation destination for Hungarians -- the southern shore, and especially the city of Siófok, is something of a party spot. The annual Balaton Sound summer music festival is held in the nearby town of Zamárdi. Families with kids prefer the relatively quiet northern side. 2. Swimsuits are necessities . Hungary has hot water to spare. There are more than 1,000 natural springs in the country (and the world's largest thermal lake at Hévíz, near Lake Balaton), with 118 in Budapest alone. On the Pest side of the river in the capital, Széchenyi Thermal Baths (Állatkerti körút 9-11, 1146 Budapest; +36 1 363 3210) claims to be the biggest thermal bathing complex in Europe. Another good Budapest bathing spot is the art nouveau Gellért Baths and Hotel (Kelenhegyi út 4, 1118 Budapest; +36 1 466 6166), at the foot of Gellért Hill. 3. Hungarians are smart; just ask the people at Nobel . The country has one of the highest rankings, per capita, for Nobel laureates, with 13 winners going back to their first, in 1905 (for physics), and the most recent, in 2004 (for chemistry). Hungarians have also invented many things, from the biro ballpoint pen (named for inventor László Bíró) to computer science (János Neumann) to Rubik's cube. As minister of state for economic strategy Zoltán Cséfalvay recently said: ""I am very proud to be able to say that everything was invented by a Hungarian."" He was joking. Sort of. 4. Franz Liszt is still huge . The composer is such a big deal here that, although he was born in what is now Austria, spoke German and French but no Hungarian and died in Germany, they renamed Budapest International Airport in his honor for the anniversary of his 200th birthday, in 2011. The reason? The village he was born in was Hungarian at the time, and he described himself as Hungarian. Liszt Ferenc (in the Hungarian naming convention, the family name always goes first) also has a square named for him in Pest. Surrounded by trendy cafes and restaurants, it's extremely popular in summer. 5. The 'little gate' is a way of life . Forty years of communism left Hungarians expert at finding what they call ""the little gate,"" an alternative way in, a work around. They're reputed to be the only people who can enter a revolving door behind you and emerge ahead. They also have an opinion on everything, so much so that it's said if you have three Hungarians in a room, they'll form four political parties. 6. Goulash isn't what you think it is . The signature national dish is gulyás, which you probably know as goulash. What's served in Western restaurants, however, is usually a stew, while what you get in Hungary is a soup. Everyone claims to have the best recipe, with an annual goulash festival held each September in Szolnok (120 kilometers southeast of the capital in central Hungary). The version at one of Budapest's best known restaurants, Gundel (Gundel Károly út 4, 1146 Budapest, next to Budapest Zoo entrance; +36 1 889 8100), will set you back HUF 3,800 ($17). Around the corner, you can get a great bowl for HUF 1,900 at Bagolyvár (Gundel Károly út 4, 1146 Budapest; +36 1 468 110; website in Hungarian), which is owned by Gundel but specializes in home-style cooking. 7. Hungarians are addicted to a red powder . There's one element of Hungarian cuisine that's present in every kitchen, from Grandma's to that of the country's first Michelin-starred restaurant, Costes (Ráday utca 4, 1092 Budapest; +36 1 219 0696): paprika. The powdered pepper is used to spice up just about every dish -- especially goulash. It's so important it was national news when spice and sauce maker Univer announced in late October that its paprika-based condiments would continue to be made from 100% Hungarian produce, despite a poor harvest. 8. Clinking beer glasses is frowned upon . Walk along Budapest's answer to London's Soho -- the pedestrianized Ráday utca teeming with bars, restaurants and galleries in the center of Pest -- and you'll hear little clinking of beer glasses. When the Hungarians lost the 1848-49 Revolution and War of Independence, Austrians executed 13 of the most senior Hungarian generals, and supposedly celebrated by drinking beer and clinking their mugs. Hungarians vowed not to clink beer glasses for the next 150 years. Although that period ended in 1999, the ""ban"" is still widely observed, especially among more elderly people. It's fine to clink wine and spirit glasses. 9. Tokaji is the Wine of Kings . Tokaji is so good that Louis XIV of France called it the ""Wine of Kings, the King of Wine."" If you want to take a bottle of the sweet dessert wine home you'll find it in most wine shops -- Bortársaság (Wine Society) has locations across Budapest and the country. Tokaji is measured by its sweetness, shown by the number of ""puttonyos."" A good example of the topaz-colored wine is Tokaji Aszú -- look for four puttonyos or more (the scale goes up to six). The best Tokaji (also rarest and most expensive) is the Essencia style. 10. Hungarians are sports mad . Hungarians love sports and are extremely proud of the fact that, per capita, the country has one of the highest tallies of Olympic medals (482 across both winter and summer games). They continue to do well at fencing, swimming, gymnastics and kayaking, but the men's water polo team is exceptional -- you'll find Hungarians gathered around TVs everywhere when the latter are playing. If you want to get a feel for the Hungarian love of sports (and beer), Champs Sport Pub (Dohány utca 20, 1074 Budapest; +36 1 413 1655), in Pest, is a good venue for watching sport among Hungarians. But be warned, it gets packed for big events. 11. Equestrian traditions are very much alive . The Hungarians rode into the Carpathian Basin -- the central European territory they conquered -- on horseback and have been in love with things equine ever since. Their famed light cavalry gave English the word Hussar (from the Hungarian ""Huszár""). The current coach-driving world champions are the Lázár brothers, who hold regular horse shows at the Lázár Equestrian Park in Domonyvölgy (Fenyő utca 47, 2182 Domonyvölgy; +36 28 576-510), about 35 kilometers from Budapest. There are plenty of other places throughout the country to take riding lessons or simply go for a hack. A good choice is the Hilltop Riding Farm (Repülőtéri út 0117/ 15 hrsz, 2100 Gödöllő, Hungary; +36 30 636 8553), in the town of Gödöllő, outside Budapest.

"(CNN) -- It may already be social media's most-shared image ever. President Barack Obama's campaign posted a photograph of him embracing his wife, first lady Michelle Obama, to Facebook and Twitter late Tuesday, moments after CNN and other news outlets projected he had won re-election over GOP challenger Mitt Romney. The accompanying message read simply, ""Four more years."" The president had tweeted a thank-you message to supporters from the same account moments earlier. But it was the image that captured the world's imagination. By Thursday the photo had been retweeted more than 785,000 times, topping a previous tweet by pop star Justin Bieber and making it the most popular message in Twitter's brief history. It also has received more than 550,000 shares and 3.9 million likes on Facebook, shattering previous records held by Mark Zuckerberg's wedding photo in May and this photo of a glass of beer, set up as a tribute to a fallen sailor. The best Election Night tweets . The image shows the president and first lady locked in a heartfelt embrace, framed against a cloudy sky. She's wearing a sleeveless summer dress; he's got his shirt sleeves rolled up and his eyes closed, a smile on his face. It was taken August 15 at an Obama rally in Dubuque, Iowa, during a three-day campaign bus tour across the state. More than 190,000 commenters weighed in about Obama's post on Facebook. Amid the congratulations and the angry posts from Romney supporters were some praising the photo. ""They are an absolutely gorgeous couple!!! So in love!"" said one comment. The posts reaffirmed the pre-eminence of social media as a crucial communications platform in the 2012 presidential race. Obama's campaign acknowledged his victory on Twitter and Facebook before he e-mailed supporters or addressed a victory rally early Wednesday in Chicago. The messages also rode a massive wave of Twitter chatter about the election returns. Twitter saw 31 million tweets on Election Day, and hit a peak of 327,452 tweets per minute as Obama was declared the winner. The Obama campaign has not revealed who took the photo, although it is nearly identical to ones snapped by Jim Watson, who covered the campaign event for Agence France-Presse.","Photo of president embracing first lady has been retweeted more than 675,000 times .

"Washington (CNN) -- Authorities searching the home of a Connecticut woman who rammed barricades and led police on a chase near the U.S. Capitol found discharge papers from a 2012 mental health evaluation that listed prescriptions to treat schizophrenia and other mental disorders, a law enforcement source briefed on the investigation said Friday. The woman, identified by law enforcement sources as Miriam Carey, 34, died after police shot her. Earlier, sources said investigators found medications, but that proved later not to be accurate. Carey's boyfriend told police in December that she appeared to be delusional, believing that President Barack Obama had placed Stamford, Connecticut, where they lived, under lockdown and that her home was under electronic surveillance, a law enforcement source involved in the investigation said. Thursday's incident played out in one of the most heavily policed places in the world, temporarily locked down Congress and sparked anxiety among tourists and staffers alike. Police say Carey rammed barricades and police cruisers -- actions Washington police Chief Cathy Lanier said appeared deliberate -- and sped down Pennsylvania Avenue before crashing. Two law enforcement officers were injured, and officers shot her to end the incident. The Carey family is questioning whether shooting her was the only way to end the chase. ""We want to know if protocols were followed,"" family attorney Eric Sanders said on CNN's AC360. Carey apparently did not have a weapon, but did have a 1-year-old girl in the car with her. The child -- Carey's daughter -- survived the chaos unharmed, officials said. The child has been taken into protective custody by the D.C. Child and Family Services Agency. She has been temporarily placed with a foster family, according an agency spokesperson. Carey's family has identified the woman's body, said Beverly Fields, a spokeswoman for the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. Why a new mom might put herself -- and her child -- in harm's way . Authorities who searched Carey's apartment in Stamford found discharge papers that listed risperidone, a medication to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, a law enforcement source said. They also found paperwork listing escitalopram, an antidepressant commonly prescribed under the brand name Lexapro, according to the source. It was not known if she was taking any of the medications, and authorities have not officially linked the incident to mental illness or any other factor. According to Xavier Amador, a psychologist and expert in schizophrenia and other mental health disorders, it is possible the medications were prescribed for postpartum psychosis, a rare illness that usually comes on suddenly within the first four weeks after birth. A few months after her daughter was born, Miriam Carey was diagnosed with postpartum depression with psychosis, her sister, Amy Carey-Jones, said on CNN's ""AC360."" ""There wasn't a pattern. It was something that occurred suddenly,"" Carey-Jones said. ""She seemed overwhelmed. There was a lot of stress. ""There was not moments of her walking around with delusions. That was not what was going on."" Her sister made progress with the help of counseling and medications. Carey-Jones said her sister recently told her that the doctors said she didn't need the medication anymore. ""They tapered her off the medications, and she said she felt fine,"" Carey-Jones said. She declined to discuss what medication her sister had taken. Carey's boyfriend contacted police last winter, when their child was four months old, according to the law enforcement source who told CNN about the boyfriend's reports to police. He told police that she was suffering from post-partum depression, was having trouble sleeping and was on medication. Carey underwent a mental health evaluation, said the source, who added that the boyfriend has been questioned by federal authorities about Thursday's events. The source told CNN that Carey left a letter addressed to the boyfriend at her apartment and that it appeared to contain white powder. The letter was being tested for hazardous substances. A car chase, gunshots . Thursday's drama began around 2 p.m., when the woman steered a black Infiniti near the White House, a U.S. Secret Service source said. She drove up to a barrier at the 15th and E street checkpoint and was approached by Secret Service officers. She hurriedly made an erratic three-point turn, striking the barrier and backing into an officer before driving away, the source told CNN. Police said the car sped down Pennsylvania Avenue toward the Capitol, where security vehicles stopped it at Garfield Circle. The woman slammed the car into reverse, crashing into a police cruiser, and tried to get away. At that point officers began firing, a witness said. Dramatic video footage by a videographer for Alhurra TV, a Middle Eastern news outlet financed by the U.S. government, showed the black vehicle then speeding around a nearby traffic circle with a police car in close pursuit and then heading away. The car crashed into more security barriers a few blocks later, witnesses said. More shots were fired after the vehicle stopped, and the woman was hit several times, said Metropolitan Police Department Chief Cathy Lanier. Carey was later pronounced dead, Lanier said. Two officers were injured. A Capitol Police officer whose vehicle crashed during the chase was hurt, authorities said. The officer was released from a hospital Thursday night. The Secret Service did not release information about its injured agent. Chaos and a child in the car . Inside the woman's car was the 1-year-old child, who was not harmed. The child was taken into protective custody, officials said. Officers didn't know there was a child inside the woman's car during the chase, officials said. Also, the early investigation revealed that there was no evidence that the woman had a gun or fired a shot. The bedlam from the fatal chase reverberated throughout a U.S. Capital already shaken by the recent mass shooting at the Navy Yard in the city and on edge due to tensions over the showdown over shutting down the federal government. Authorities locked down the Capitol building and other government facilities in the area. House and Senate sessions were immediately suspended, with legislators ordered to take cover and keep away from windows. Police also closed Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House. Sirens blared as people in and around government office buildings reported hearing gunshots. Bystanders hid in fear. Shemaiah Ofori-Attah and her husband, Edmund, at first thought the speeding black car and sirens were part of a motorcade. ""Then when we heard the gunshots we knew this was something serious, so we just dropped to the ground,"" she said. Danny Farkas, the Alhurra videographer, captured the scene. He said he had a fleeting thought that perhaps the driver had explosives in the car. ""I was surprised at the movie-like quality of what was going on in front of me,"" he told CNN's ""New Day.""

"(Oprah) -- The Master and Margarita . By Mikhail Bulgakov . Daniel Radcliffe has amazon.com to thank for introducing him to this satirical novel about Stalinist Russia, which Bulgakov wrote in secret from 1928 until just before his death in 1940, and which was finally published 26 years later. ""I was reading Louis de BerniÃ¨res's trilogy on Latin America and this book came up as something I might like, so I bought it,"" says Radcliffe. ""It's now my favorite novel -- it's just the greatest explosion of imagination, craziness, satire, humor, and heart."" The fantastical work so captured Radcliffe that for his 21st birthday, he traveled to Russia to visit the author's apartment in Moscow. ""There are passages that have become everyday Russian sayings. For instance, 'Manuscripts don't burn.' If it had ever come out that this book was being written, Bulgakov would likely have disappeared permanently. That phrase stands for the fact that nothing is more powerful or more indestructible than the written word."" Oprah.com: See O's fall reading list . Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas . By Hunter S. Thompson . ""This is one of the funniest books I've ever read, which is the main reason I recommend it to people,"" says Radcliffe, who was given Thompson's drug-fueled, madcap rumination on American culture in the 1960s as a 15th birthday present by a friend on the Potter set. ""But there is a sadness in it as well. I think Thompson loved America despite himself, and this is a lament for the passing of a time that we'll never see again. He was such an intelligent and socially aware person; he knew even when he wrote this in 1971 that a decade like the '60s could not happen again. And it is kind of sad to read it now because I know I will never have the feeling of living in a time that fresh and with so few boundaries."" Oprah.com: The latest award winners: How many have you read? Germinal . By Emile Zola . This hefty masterpiece about the plight of French miners in the 1860s ""made me realize that when books are considered 'classics,' most of the time they're actually very readable and exciting,"" Radcliffe says. ""It amazes me how deftly Zola captures the idiosyncrasy, the mundanity, and the scale of life among all these different classes of people. Every character feels fully formed and real. And once I learned more about Zola's involvement in the Dreyfus affair"" -- the infamous turn-of-the-century case in which Zola, citing anti-Semitism, publicly accused the French army of wrongfully convicting a Jewish captain of treason -- ""and how he advocated for individual freedom, I just thought, I love this man. He must have been an incredible person to know."" Oprah.com: How Toni Morrison gets inspired . Labyrinths . By Jorge Luis Borges . This collection of short stories by a master of magical realism ""blew my mind,"" says Radcliffe. ""When I read a good book, I sometimes like to think I might be capable of writing something similar, but never, in my wildest dreams, could I write anything that approaches the level of cleverness and intellect and madness of Borges. I don't think anyone could."" His favorite? The Argentinean writer's short story ""The Library of Babel"" (""Borges proves that if you can write a story in ten pages, it doesn't need to be any longer""), in which he imagines an infinite library filled with every book written, not yet written, and every combination of words and letters in between. ""The premise is that contained somewhere in these books is the meaning of life. So cults develop that walk through the library searching for it. The fact that Borges could start with such an idea -- an infinite library, what would that involve? -- and then take it to a logical conclusion is remarkable.""

I made it my mission after hearing it to read one book by every author on the list, which starts with Aphra Behn and ends with Rushdie. So I bought Midnight's Children."" Radcliffe says people scoffed when he picked up the novel, thinking he was too young to grasp it. ""I still have no idea why. It is the most enchanting book.

"(CNN) -- Since the beginning of time, man has looked up into the cosmos at those shiny, twinkling stars and thought, ""I wonder if lizards would do each other up there?"" So, finally, after all these years, and for the sake of humanity, Russian scientists decided to find out once and for all. Because Russia. Really, it was that or another inconclusive nesting doll experiment. And, somehow, stacking little wooden Gorbachevs doesn't quite have the same pizazz as closely monitoring outer-space lizard whoopee. Thus, the world recently got introduced to Russia's brave ""Space Sex Geckos."" The idea was this: Roscosmos (Russia's federal space agency) would send five of these little critters into orbit on board a Foton-M4 satellite to study sexual reproduction in zero gravity. Four geckos would be female. One would be male. And, for the sake of the experiment, hopefully straight. ""I don't know about that guy, Vlad. He's always watching 'Antiques Roadshow.' "" Assuming that they properly picked out a willing male gecko with a healthy libido, good looks and/or an impressive bank account, their hope was that the quintet of lizards would get into space and then violate each other in the most orderly way possible. Fortunately, they were Russian. So, I'm pretty sure the lizards already knew how to queue. And if that wasn't weird enough, there would also be cameras on board so that scientists back on land could observe the space coitus. Yes, grown professionals, many with fancy degrees, were literally going to have to sit around and watch live lizard porn. So, they had that going for them. After choosing the lucky participants, on July 19th Roscosmos launched their (possibly fur-lined) satellite into space for what they hoped would be two full months of this bizarre Gecko Rumspringa. But soon, after just several orbits, things went bad. Mission control lost contact with the satellite. ""Come in, space sex geckos. Come in. Moan once with desire if you can hear me."" Days later they were able to reestablish contact. However, it was unclear if the life-support system continued to function during the blackout. If not, it was unlikely that the geckos would survive. On the plus side, had the geckos somehow become aware of their impending doom, I'm guessing there would've been several rounds of camera-free, super kinky, we're-all-going-to-die lizard sex. ""Hey, ladies! Look who brought whipped cream and tiny handcuffs!"" As the Russian space agency began sharing updates with the public, it quickly became a running joke online. The space sex geckos were suddenly famous to the world. But probably dead, for their clumsy end was perilously near. Which sort of takes the fun out of being international lizard celebrities. Nevertheless, they were stars. Even comedian John Oliver, on his HBO show ""Last Week Tonight,"" latched on to the story and started the Twitter hashtag #GoGetThoseGeckos. However, on Monday, September 1st, a couple weeks short of its intended stay in space, the satellite came crashing back down to Earth, where the world finally learned the fate of the space sex geckos. In a statement, Roscosmos later confirmed their worst fear. Something went horribly wrong. And the lizards ... they have died. Frozen and mummified from having expired at least a week prior to impact, the tiny remains of the space sex geckos were recovered from a quiet field where the craft landed. Fallen heroes. Possibly aroused. But it wasn't only death and failure. Because a colony of fruit flies was also put on board for the mission, and they were found healthy and alive in a different chamber of the satellite. And, apparently, they managed to do what the lizards likely couldn't. The nasty. In fact, at the expense of God-knows-how-many rubles, new generations of offspring were conceived while in orbit. And now -- lucky us -- the world has more fruit flies. Because Russia. Follow @JarrettBellini on Twitter. And prepare to be underwhelmed.

"Washington (CNN) -- Republicans call it a government cover-up similar to what forced Richard Nixon to resign. Democrats call it a right-wing conspiracy theory. The fallout from the September 11, 2012, terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans continues more than 19 months later, with further details last week that raised questions about how the Obama administration responded to the violence less than two months before the President's re-election. Few issues reveal the hyper-partisan politics of Washington more than the ongoing debate over an issue now known simply as Benghazi. Last Friday, House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa announced that he had subpoenaed Secretary of State John Kerry to testify at a May 21 hearing, alleging that the State Department failed to comply with an earlier subpoena for documents. House Speaker John Boehner followed up by announcing a special congressional committee led by a Republican colleague would investigate the matter. The House voted on party lines Thursday to create the panel, but Democrats have yet to decide if they will take part in what they claim could be a Republican-led witch hunt. GOP-led House votes to establish select committee on Benghazi . Hillary Clinton: No reason for new Benghazi committee . Issa called the administration's lack of compliance ""in violation of any reasonable transparency or historic precedent at least since Richard Milhous Nixon."" At the White House, spokesman Jay Carney shot back that Republicans continued trying to reap political benefit with what he called conspiracy theories about a Benghazi cover-up. ""What we have seen since hours after the attack, beginning with a statement by the Republican nominee for president, is an attempt by Republicans to politicize a tragedy, and that continues today,"" Carney told reporters, adding that ""what hasn't changed has been the effort by Republicans to ... claim a conspiracy when they haven't been able to find one."" Here are some answers to questions about the latest twists in the story: . What happened in Benghazi? In September of 2012, a demeaning video made in the United States about the Prophet Mohammed got posted on YouTube and sparked protests at U.S. embassies in the Muslim world. On September 11, the anniversary of the 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States, an assault occurred at a U.S. compound in Benghazi that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. The Obama administration initially blamed the Benghazi attack on a protest against the video that escalated into a full-blown tactical assault. As details emerged in ensuing days, it became clear that an al Qaeda-affiliated group took part in what was a coordinated terrorist attack instead of a spontaneous demonstration. Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton created a special panel called an Accountability Review Board to investigate what happened. The group led by former Joint Chiefs Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen and retired U.S. Ambassador Thomas Pickering criticized aspects of diplomatic security and made 29 recommendations, all of which were accepted by the State Department. Why all the controversy? Coming less than two months before the presidential election, the Benghazi attack quickly became a political flashpoint. President Barack Obama had campaigned heavily on his decision to approve the mission that killed Osama bin Laden and boasted of putting the al Qaeda leader's organization ""on the run."" On September 16, five days after the Benghazi attack, then U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice went on Sunday talk shows and said the assault grew out of a protest against the controversial video. Republicans immediately challenged the administration's version of what happened, calling it an attempt by the Obama administration to hide a major security breakdown that signaled the broader failed policy in the region. Obama won re-election in November, but Republicans have mounted congressional investigations into what happened in Benghazi and why Rice gave an incorrect explanation to the American people. What is the Benghazi email everyone is talking about? Last Tuesday, the conservative group Judicial Watch made public State Department documents it received in response to a Freedom of Information Act request. One of the documents was a previously undisclosed email on September 14, 2012, from Ben Rhodes, a national security official specializing in communications, that listed talking points for Rice about the protests that had erupted at U.S. embassies and compounds in the Muslim world. Among the goals listed in the Rhodes email was to ""underscore that these protests are rooted in an Internet video, and not a broader failure of policy."" Republicans contend the email proves White House manipulation of the messaging for political purposes in the immediate aftermath of Benghazi, despite the administration's contention that Rice relied on talking points provided by the CIA for the sake of uniformity of messaging. ""This is all about an effort to convince the American people that the president of the United States had everything under control,"" GOP Sen. John McCain said. Boehner and other Republicans questioned why the Rhodes email wasn't included in documents that the State Department provided to Congress under the earlier subpoena. In announcing the new subpoena of Kerry, Issa cited what he called ""a disturbing disregard for the (State) Department's legal obligations to Congress."" Carney argued that the Rhodes email referred to the broader topic of protests throughout the Muslim world, rather than the specific Benghazi attack. Meanwhile, a State Department spokeswoman took issue with Issa's latest subpoena, telling reporters it was a political stunt. Noting Kerry was scheduled to be out of the country on the date of the hearing in the subpoena, Marie Harf said Issa's committee ""would have known if they reached out to us instead of issuing a subpoena."" Is this new or just more of what we already knew? The existence of the Rhodes email is new, and that provides Republicans with a fresh front in their attacks on the administration over Benghazi. Labeling the situation a ""defiance of the House's subpoena power,"" Boehner called it ""the most flagrant example yet of the administration's contempt for the American people's right to know the truth about what happened when four Americans died in a fiery terrorist attack."" However, the messaging contained in the Rhodes email is the same as included in previously released documents, such as the CIA talking points that Rice relied on. Carney noted that the only reference in the Rhodes email to Benghazi -- denying that there was actionable intelligence ahead of time of an imminent assault -- was lifted from the CIA talking points. I thought the government promised to release all information? The Obama administration previously pledged to release all pertinent information on Benghazi sought by Congress. Carney noted that it turned over 25,000 pages of documents and that various officials testified at a series of hearings by various congressional committees investigating the matter. Asked why the Rhodes email obtained by Judicial Watch hadn't been turned over previously, Carney said it came under a FOIA request that differed from the congressional subpoenas from Issa's committee. Underlying Carney's explanation was that the Rhodes email referred to the broader issue of protests rather than the specific Benghazi attack, which was the focus of the subpoenas. The talking points supplied by Rhodes were intended to prepare Rice for possible questions in her talk show appearances, he said, calling the document a normal duty of a communications officer in any government. Republicans questioned that explanation, noting the Benghazi attack would clearly be the dominant topic that Rice would face and arguing the administration clearly knew that. What's the upshot of all this? For Republicans, the issue resonates with their conservative base, especially the accusation that the administration failed to provide proper security for American diplomats and was unable to send military assets to respond to the Benghazi attack. At a hearing last week by Issa's committee, a retired Air Force general on duty at U.S. Africa Command that night complained that the military should have tried to save the Benghazi victims even if the effort would have been futile. When Republican Rep. James Lankford asked Brig. Gen. Robert Lovell ""did we have their back that night,"" Lovell responded: ""Obviously not, sir."" Boehner's announcement of a special panel to further investigate Benghazi fulfilled a request by many GOP colleagues eager to frame the final years of Obama's presidency on their terms. Until now, Boehner had resisted calls to establish such a committee, pointing to the four House panels already investigating the matter. Democrats wanting to get past the issue portray Republicans as driven by partisan desire to hurt Obama. Carney has referred to what he described as GOP conspiracy theories regarding Benghazi that have failed to pan out. ""Everything that this committee would look at has already been looked at ad nauseam by multiple committees,"" Harf said. ""What's the point?"" Is there more than meets the eye? In Washington, always. The issue gives Republicans perhaps their lone line of attack against Hillary Clinton, the overwhelming favorite for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016 if she decides to run. A new poll Thursday showed Clinton's strong standing. The Quinnipiac University survey from Florida had Clinton topping former two-term Gov. Jeb Bush, the leading potential Republican contender in the nation's most populous swing state. Because Clinton was secretary of state when the Benghazi attack occurred, Republicans have sought to depict her as inattentive to security needs of diplomatic staff. At the Oversight Committee hearing last week, Lovell described how he and others desperately considered possible deployment of a rapid-force team to Benghazi, but needed a State Department request that never came. ""Were they doing what they were trained to do or were they sitting around and waiting for the State Department and Hillary Clinton to call them up and say do something?"" GOP Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah asked him. However, the Republican chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Rep. Howard ""Buck"" McKeon of California, issued a statement that said his panel investigated the matter and found ""no evidence that Department of State officials delayed the decision to deploy what few resources (the military) had available to respond."" Democrats face what analysts expect will be a difficult mid-term election in November, with little chance of winning back the House from Republicans and facing the possibility of losing their majority in the Senate. Boehner's call for yet another congressional committee to investigate could provide Democrats with a rallying point to motivate voters to prevent Republicans from retaking the Senate in November and gaining full control of Congress. CNN's Jim Acosta and Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.","House votes to form a select committee; Democrats undecided on taking part .

"(CNN) -- Actor Stephen Collins, who is in the news for child molestation allegations, is best known for playing the clergyman father in the TV series ""7th Heaven."" But he has had a long career on television, theater and the movies. Here are some details about his life: . 1. You've seen him on the big screen. The Iowa-born, New York-raised Collins, who turned 67 on October 1, made his film debut in 1976's ""All the President's Men"" as Hugh Sloan, a real-life person who was treasurer of Richard Nixon's 1972 presidential campaign committee. Three years later, he starred as Capt. Willard Decker in ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture,"" one of a handful of non-""Star Trek"" regulars to have a major role in the 1979 film. Other Collins films include ""Jumpin' Jack Flash,"" ""The Big Picture,' ""The First Wives Club"" and ""Blood Diamond."" He could have gotten his big-screen debut earlier. According to People magazine, Collins was considered for the Ryan O'Neal role in ""Love Story"" but had already agreed to another part. Collins was supposed to appear in the upcoming ""Ted 2"" but was fired from the job in the wake of the molestation allegations. Bizarre end to '7th Heaven' actor Stephen Collins' day . 2. He had a number of TV spots before ""7th Heaven."" Collins was the star of ""Tales of the Gold Monkey,"" a 1983 series that attempted to channel the success of the ""Indiana Jones"" movies, with Collins cast as an adventurous 1930s bush pilot. It lasted a season. In 1988, he starred in ""Tattingers,"" a much-hyped series (from ""St. Elsewhere's"" Bruce Paltrow and John Masius) about a New York restaurant. It was also gone within a season. ""Working It Out,"" from 1990, lasted a season as well. He also appeared in TV miniseries and movies, earning an Emmy nomination for 1987's ""The Two Mrs. Grenvilles"" and playing John F. Kennedy in 1991's ""A Woman Named Jackie."" 3. He found major success with ""7th Heaven."" As the Rev. Eric Camden, Collins finally found a lead role on a long-running series. ""7th Heaven,"" about a Protestant minister and his family in Southern California, ran for 11 seasons on the WB (later the CW) from 1996-2007 and earned a steady following for its wholesome characters and issue-oriented storylines. ""It may have been a throwback to the 1950s,"" wrote Tim Brooks and Earle Marsh in ""The Complete Guide to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows,"" ""but for its loyal viewers it was an oasis of normalcy in a TV desert full of dysfunctional and ever more hostile families."" (The series was produced by Aaron Spelling, better known for such shows as ""Charlie's Angels,"" ""The Love Boat"" and ""Melrose Place."") His ""7th Heaven"" role influenced his real life. In 1999, People magazine reported that Collins spent one Sunday a month as a lay eucharistic minister at a Los Angeles Episcopalian church. ""I guess life does imitate art!"" he told the magazine. Since ""7th Heaven's"" departure, Collins has had regular roles in ""Private Practice"" and ""Revolution,"" among others. UPtv, a family-friendly network, said it was pulling reruns of ""7th Heaven"" from its lineup in the wake of the sexual allegations. 4. He's worked in theater -- and as an author. According to his website, Collins has appeared in more than a dozen Broadway and off-Broadway productions, including the original production of ""The Ritz,"" the American premiere of Stephen Sondheim's ""Putting It Together"" and the recent Broadway run of ""Monty Python's Spamalot."" He played King Arthur, a role originated by Tim Curry. Collins, urged on by friend Christopher Guest, also wrote two novels: ""Eye Contact"" and ""Double Exposure."" 5. He's going through a messy divorce. The recent scandal was precipitated by Collins' divorce from actress Faye Grant, whom he married in 1985. (His first marriage, to Marjorie Weinman, ended in 1978.) According to divorce documents filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, Grant says she learned that Collins had ""been engaging in a long-term pattern of sexually molesting children."" She said Collins admitted to her that he molested three underage girls more than a decade prior, the court document says. Neither Collins' attorney nor his agent immediately returned any of CNN's numerous calls. Grant's representatives also didn't respond to requests for comment. Grant said in the court documents that she was unaware of Collins' behavior until he told her in January 2012. They separated the next month, after almost 27 years of marriage. Collins and Grant have one child, a daughter. TMZ released an audio recording Tuesday that purports to have been recorded during a November 2012 therapy session involving Collins and Grant. In it, the website says, Collins made incriminating statements similar to those Grant accuses him of in divorce filings, namely that he admitted to her that he molested underage girls. Grant told E! News she had nothing to do with the release of the recording. CNN's Saeed Ahmed, Jane Caffrey and Shimon Prokupecz contributed to this story.","Stephen Collins' acting career goes back almost five decades .

"Beitunya, West Bank (CNN) -- Fakher Zayed is accustomed to trouble erupting on his doorstep. For the past several years, Palestinian protesters have often clashed with Israeli security forces in front of his house. The four-story building stands on the edge of the West Bank village of Beitunya, within sight of the Israeli separation barrier and Ofer prison. At first, the May 15 anniversary of the ""Nakba,"" the exodus of more than 700,000 Palestinians after the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, looked like just another day of Israeli-Palestinian skirmishing. ""(The Palestinians) were throwing stones, and the (Israeli) soldiers throw the tear gas. Plastic bullets,"" Zayed said. ""They run away. After three or four minutes, they came back to throw stones again."" To protect his home, his family and his carpentry business, Zayed installed more than half a dozen security cameras around his building, which operate 24 hours a day. Last Thursday, these cameras captured the chilling shooting deaths of two Palestinian teenagers. According to six hours of raw, unedited video distributed by the children's rights advocacy organization Defense for Children International and reviewed by CNN, the two boys -- ages 17 and 16 -- were shot on the same patch of asphalt on the same day, the second victim 73 minutes after the first. The families of the boys, as well as Zayed, blame the Israeli military for the killings. ""This is the first time they're shooting to kill here,"" Zayed said, speaking to CNN while standing on the exact spot outside his home where the two boys were filmed being shot. But an Israeli military spokesman say its forces fired no live rounds during hours of clashes on May 15. ""During that demonstration that was extremely violent, the Israeli Defense Force used crowd-control methods and riot-dispersal means to prevent and control the overflow of the violence,"" Lt. Col. Peter Lerner told CNN. ""The preliminary IDF inquiry indicates that no live fire was shot at all on Thursday during the riots in Beitunya, and we have to determine what caused this result,"" Lerner added. Security camera footage . CNN producer Kareem Khadder was filming the clashes in Beitunya on May 15. Several dozen Palestinian youths used the wall of Zayed's house as cover. Periodically, they jumped out to hurl stones at about a half-dozen Israeli soldiers and border police officers standing on a hilltop perhaps 100 meters away. The Israeli forces responded with volleys of tear gas while periodically firing rubber-coated bullets from their rifles. At one point, Khadder filmed a Palestinian teenager who appeared to be struck in the leg with one of these semi-lethal rounds. The boy hopped and limped for a few seconds in obvious pain but then turned around and rejoined the clashes. At 1:45 p.m. May 15, Zayed's security camera caught the moment when one of the stone-throwing boys was mortally wounded. Seventeen-year-old Nadeem Nouwarah was dressed in a sleeveless black t-shirt, wearing a black and white kefiyeh scarf to cover his face and carrying a backpack over both shoulders. As he walked toward the Israeli military positions in front of Zayed's door, Nouwarah suddenly fell forward, landing briefly on his hands, before rolling over to lie on his back. Within seconds, a crowd of Palestinians gathered to lift Nouwarah and rush him to a waiting ambulance. According to a medical report, Nouwarah was pronounced dead in a hospital less than two hours later, having suffered a single bullet wound that entered his chest and passed out his back. Though Khadder didn't know it at the time, he was filming two Israeli security troops firing their rifles at the Palestinian protesters at the same exact moment when Nouwarah was shot. In the video, it is not clear what kind of rounds the Israelis were shooting or whether their gunfire hit Nouwarah. However, Khadder's camera shows that less than 15 seconds after one of these gunshots, Palestinians were already racing to put the fatally wounded Nouwarah in the ambulance. Suffering the effects of tear gas, Khadder soon left the protest. He was unaware that Nouwarah's wounds were fatal. At 2:58 p.m., the security cameras filmed a second fatal shooting. Sixteen-year-old Mohammad Odeh Salameh was at the front lines of the protest, wearing a green Hamas flag as a cape as well as a green Hamas headband over his black mask. As he was walking away from the Israeli positions, he suddenly fell to the ground and struggled briefly to get up. The boy was shot just a few steps from where Nouwarah had been wounded. Doctors pronounced Salameh dead on arrival at the hospital, with a bullet wound that had pierced his back and exited his chest. School in mourning . At St. George's school in Ramallah, relatives and classmates of the first victim, Nouwarah, were in mourning this week. Students wore black t-shirts with photos of the smiling boy. The eleventh-grader was pictured wearing a backward baseball cap. ""There were 21 students in our grade,"" said his 16-year-old classmate George Yousef. ""Now, we are 20."" Nouwarah's father, Siam, told CNN he had expressly instructed his eldest son not to attend the Nakba protests. ""Afterwards, I felt he was not convinced with what I told him,"" said Siam, who works as a hairdresser in Ramallah. Nouwarah appeared to have gone to the anti-Israel protests directly from school on the afternoon of May 15. His father showed CNN the bloody backpack his son was wearing when he was shot. There was a small hole in the bag, in roughly the same location where the bullet would have exited Nouwarah's body. Siam Nouwarah then pulled a packet of bloodstained papers out of the bag. They were photocopies of a textbook that included the writings of Anton Chekhov, accompanied by a teenage student's handwriting, doodles and class notes. ""We were surprised when we took the school backpack back from the hospital to find this bullet inside,"" said the elder Nouwarah. He then pulled a small used bullet stored in a plastic bag out of the backpack. The metal slug appeared to be from a 556 NATO round, the standard ammunition used in M-16 rifles carried by Israeli security forces. It was impossible for CNN to confirm the authenticity of the bullet. Siam Nouwarah said he was saving it for a forensic examination. He accuses Israeli soldiers of killing his son. ""The entire world should understand and know that my son was wearing a school backpack and leaving school when he was assassinated in cold blood,"" the grieving father said. Ballistics . On Thursday, Lerner, the Israeli military spokesman, told CNN that a request had been put in with the Palestinian Authority to do a ballistic report on the bullet found in Nouwarah's backpack. ""That round that was presented shouldn't have been in the bag, so it also raises a question,"" he said. Lerner repeated the military's assertion that Israeli security forces fired only rubber-coated bullets -- which are not designed to penetrate bodies -- in Beitunya on May 15. Regarding the CNN video of the Israeli security forces firing rifles at the Palestinian demonstrators at the moment when Nouwarah was shot, Lerner said the weapons being used had an attachment at the end of the barrel for firing rubber-coated projectiles. Asked whether there could been some malfunction or mistake that would have led to the firing of a lethal round rather than a rubber-coated projectile, Lerner said, ""I'm not aware of any malfunction at this time."" Meanwhile, the U.S. State Department has joined several human rights groups calling for an investigation into the deadly incident. ""I am deeply concerned about the circumstances surrounding the recent death of two Palestinian minors,"" wrote Christopher Gunness, a spokesman for the United Nations in the West Bank. According to initial reports, Gunness added, both boys appeared ""unarmed and appeared to pose no direct threat.""","May 15 marks the ""Nakba"" exodus of Palestinians after the 1948 Arab-Israeli war .

"Oxnard, California (CNN) -- Thousands of strange sea creatures are washing ashore on California beaches, puzzling tourists and thrilling scientists quick to explain the phenomenon. ""The scientific name is Velella velella,"" said David Bader, director of education at the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach, California. ""They're jelly-like creatures, but they're not exactly jellyfish."" Also known as ""by-the-wind sailors,"" the creatures have a clear, distinctive fin sticking up from a blue, oval body no larger than the palm of a hand. ""Every now and then, the currents and the winds will change and these guys will, instead of being pushed out to sea, they actually wind up on the beach,"" Bader told CNN. They first started showing up in Washington and Oregon, and by mid-July reached San Francisco. On Thursday, photos turned up on Twitter from Hollywood and Silver Strand beaches in Oxnard. By-the-wind sailors do sting to catch their food, but humans need not worry. ""That sting is not very potent. It's nothing that could actually get through my skin,"" Bader said while holding an assortment of the creatures. Velella velella feeds on plankton and fish eggs caught with tentacles that hang down from its jelly-like body. The creatures float on top of the ocean with their fins sticking straight up, leaving them at the mercy of the wind and the current. ""Out at sea, they look like bubbles on the surface of the ocean until you get up on them,"" said Julie Bursek of NOAA's Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary. They don't live long on the shore, causing their deep blue color to fade until their clear, tougher fins are all that's left behind. ""A lot of people probably never knew an organism like this existed in the world,"" Bader said. ""And you know the winds change, and all of a sudden they wash up on shore and we get to see what the ocean is really made of."" 30 mesmerizing underwater photos .","These little sea creatures are called ""by-the-wind sailors""; the scientific name is Velella velella .

"(CNN) -- The outpatient clinic where comedian Joan Rivers suffered cardiac arrest during a procedure last week is being investigated, a health official said Thursday. Rivers was on life support and died at a New York hospital Thursday afternoon, a week after suffering cardiac arrest during a medical procedure, her daughter said. ""She passed peacefully at 1:17 p.m. surrounded by family and close friends,"" Melissa Rivers said in a statement. Rivers was taken to the hospital after she stopped breathing at the Yorkville Endoscopy clinic last Thursday. In addition, the New York medical examiner office ""will be investigating the death of Joan Rivers,"" spokeswoman Julie Bolcer told CNN. The New York State Department of Health is ""investigating the matter,"" spokesman James O'Hara told CNN. The length of the investigation will depend on how complicated the case becomes, O'Hara said. Rivers, 81, was undergoing an apparently minor elective procedure at the clinic when she suffered cardiac and respiratory arrest, according to the New York Fire Department. Paramedics took her by ambulance to Mount Sinai Hospital, about a mile from the clinic, where she was listed in critical condition. Daughter Melissa Rivers confirmed Tuesday that her mother was on life support. She revealed Wednesday that Rivers had been moved from the intensive care unit to a private room, ""where she is being kept comfortable."" A Rivers statement on Sunday said that the family was ""keeping our fingers crossed."" The clinic has not responded to repeated calls from CNN about the state's investigation. Yorkville Endoscopy's website says it is an ""ambulatory surgical center"" that has been ""approved by theÂ Department ofÂ Health."" The description of its accreditations is blank. ""Yorkville Endoscopy is a state of the art facility, staffed by highly experienced endoscopists whose mission is to provide safe andÂ compassionate care to patients and their families,"" the website says.

"(CNN) -- After a blockbuster summer with the action thriller ""Lucy,"" Scarlett Johansson is eyeing TV. The 29-year-old actress and new mom has signed up for a limited TV series based on Edith Wharton's ""The Custom of the Country,"" Variety reports. Wharton's 1913 novel followed the intensely ambitious heroine Undine Spragg as she climbed the ranks of New York society. Johansson will portray the lead in the eight-episode series, and will also serve as an executive producer. It's a change of pace for the actress, who has been working mainly in movies since she was a kid, although she did appear in the pilot episode of the short-lived 1995 TV series ""The Client,"" and has done voice work for Adult Swim's ""Robot Chicken."" More recently, she's been finding success as an action star, playing the Black Widow in Marvel's blockbuster movies. In July, she starred as the titular ruthless heroine in Luc Besson's ""Lucy,"" which earned $125 million domestically.

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- A slate of Cabinet ministers for Libya's emerging government was finalized Sunday, two spokesmen for the National Transitional Council said. The names of those in the new Cabinet are expected to be released soon, said the spokesmen, who declined to be named. The transitional council has organized the military and political movement to unseat Libya's long-time ruler Moammar Gadhafi. It moved its capital from Benghazi to Tripoli last month, after anti-Gadhafi forces took over the city, and is recognized as Libya's legitimate government by many nations and world bodies, including the United Nations and African Union. In that time -- and as fighting continues against regime loyalists in a few locales -- council representatives have spoken for the government internationally and also tried to execute certain functions within Libya. But up until now, the group has not had ministers formally charged with overseeing certain aspects of government. Gadhafi son slams Interpol arrest warrant . One of those places that remains a battle zone, in addition to Bani Walid and Sabha, is Sirte. Last week, the transitional council said that the central coastal city and about 5,000 pro-Gadhafi loyalists inside were surrounded by its forces. On Saturday, the group's chairman Mustafa Abdul Jalil gave civilians 48 hours to leave before a full-scale offensive is launched. Souad Masoudi, a spokeswoman for the International Committee of Red Cross, earlier this weekend claimed that about 10,000 people had fled Sirte. The group described humanitarian conditions inside the besieged city as dire, adding that medical supplies appeared to be in dangerously short supply. On Sunday -- after having earlier efforts, by boat, aborted due to ""the security situation"" -- a Red Cross team entered Sirte by land from the west, the group said in a press release. They met with civil representatives who claimed dangerous shortages of drinking water, hygiene items and food, including for infants. The team also went to Ibn Sina hospital, with the operation's leader Hichem Khadraoui describing the conditions for medical personnel as ""extremely difficult."" Libyan Jew returns from exile . There, they delivered enough surgical material -- including body bags and dressing kits -- to treat about 200 wounded people, as well as 400 liters (about 106 gallons) of fuel for the facility's generator. ""The hospital is facing a huge influx of patients, medical supplies are running out, and there is a desperate need for oxygen,"" Khadraoui said. ""On top of that, the water reservoir is damaged.""","The slate of ministers was made final Sunday, 2 transitional council spokesmen say .

"(CNN) -- The story of Lauren Bacall and Humphrey Bogart, one of Hollywood's most iconic romances, starts on the screen. The pair first met on the set of 1944's ""To Have and Have Not,"" which was also Bacall's screen debut. Anyone who's seen the film can't help but notice the couple's undeniable chemistry, and the attraction soon crackled off-screen. Three weeks into filming Bogart made his move, popping into Bacall's trailer, surprising her with a kiss and then asking for her number, according to Vanity Fair, which spoke to Bacall at length in 2011. (The actress died Tuesday in New York at age 89.) There was one wrinkle, though: Bogart was married to actress Mayo Methot, with whom he was known to have a difficult, volatile relationship. The couple tried to keep their burgeoning love affair secret from Methot, known for her temper, and the rest of Hollywood, but it eventually became clear to all, the magazine notes. Shortly after his divorce from Methot, a 45-year-old Bogart wed Bacall, then 20, at Malabar Farm in Ohio in May 1945. The couple's 25-year age difference may have raised some eyebrows, but it didn't bother Bacall a bit. ""I fairly often have thought how lucky I was,"" Bacall told Vanity Fair. ""I knew everybody because I was married to Bogie, and that 25-year difference was the most fantastic thing for me to have in my life. ... I was happy being his wife. I loved it. Because I really loved him."" The stars went on to have two children, Stephen and Leslie, and made three additional films together. Bogart, who had been married three times before Bacall, stayed with his frequent co-star until his death from cancer in 1957.

"Fort Meade, Maryland (CNN) -- Convicted leaker Army Pfc. Bradley Manning acknowledged Wednesday that by leaking tens of thousands of pages of classified documents he ""hurt people and hurt the United States."" ""I understood what I was doing was wrong but I didn't appreciate the broader effects of my actions,"" he said during his sentencing hearing at Maryland's Fort Meade. ""I only wanted to help people, not hurt people."" The former Army intelligence analyst was convicted in July of stealing and disseminating 750,000 pages of documents and videos to WikiLeaks in what has been described as the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history. He was found guilty of 20 of the 22 charges against him, including violations of the U.S. Espionage Act. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange took the military court to task, saying it was out to humiliate Manning. ""Mr. Manning's forced decision to apologise to the US government in the hope of shaving a decade or more off his sentence must be regarded with compassion and understanding,"" a statement from Assange, now holed up in the Ecuador's embassy in London, said. ""Mr. Manning's apology is a statement extorted from him under the overbearing weight of the United States military justice system."" How many years Manning spends behind bars is up to Col. Denise Lind, the judge in the case. She already found him not guilty of the most serious charge -- aiding the enemy -- and she later granted a defense motion that decreased the maximum penalty Manning faced from 136 years in prison to 90 years. Manning has claimed he leaked the material to expose wrongdoing and provoke discussion about U.S. military and diplomatic affairs. But in court on Wednesday, he told the judge that he now recognized he should have handled it a different way. ""I should have worked more aggressively within the system,"" he said. Manning also said at the time he decided to leak the documents, he was ""dealing with a lot of issues"" -- a reference to his gender identity crisis that the defense has made a focal point in the case. But he told the judge it was not an excuse for what he did. While Manning said he recognized that he has to pay a price for what for he did, he told the judge that he hoped someday to get out of prison and lead a productive life. His statement followed testimony from a military psychologist, who said Manning appeared to be isolated and under intense pressure as a male soldier struggling with gender identity issues. ""There would never be a time that he could be openly female,"" Capt. Michael Worsley testified. ""And so seeking treatment for that, treatment was how to adjust to that, not treat the disorder, but how to be comfortable with that in the Army."" Father: My son was 'grandstanding' With much of the testimony in Manning's sentencing hearing focusing on his gender identify issues, the Army on Wednesday released a full version of an e-mail he had sent to his sergeant titled ""My Problem."" While Manning does not specifically identify the problem he was referring to, the e-mail includes an image of him wearing a long blond wig and makeup. ""It's not going away, its haunting me more and more as I get older,"" he wrote in the e-mail. ""Now, the consequences of it are dire, at a time when it's causing me great pain in itself. As a result, I'm not sure what to do about it."" Manning's sister, Casey Major, and his aunt, Debra Van Alstyne, asked for leniency in sentencing after providing the court with an intimate look at his upbringing, which they said was characterized by absentee, alcoholic parents. But the prosecution has offered a picture of a calculating Manning whose behavior was reckless, saying he put the lives of soldiers and civilians in danger. During the court-martial, prosecution witnesses testified Manning downloaded and leaked 400,000 Pentagon field reports from Iraq and 90,0000 similar documents from Afghanistan. There evidence also presented that he downloaded and leaked more than 250,000 State Department cables. The release of the classified material elevated what was once a virtually unknown WikiLeaks to a globally recognized name. Outside the courtroom, Manning's civilian attorney, David Coombs, said he hoped the judge would see that ""Bradley is certainly a person who had his heart in the right place."" Earlier in the case, Manning testified about his treatment by the Marines at Quantico Brig in Virginia. The judge ruled that the Marines' harsh treatment of Manning was out of line and granted him 112 days off his eventual sentence. Later, before the start of his court-martial, Manning read a detailed statement after entering guilty pleas on 10 lesser charges in hopes the prosecution would pursue fewer of the charges against him. It didn't work. CNN's Chris Lawrence and Larry Shaughnessy contributed to this report.","NEW: WikiLeaks founder calls Manning's apology ""forced""

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- As ""Black Friday"" follows Thanksgiving in the United States, ""White Day"" follows Valentines Day in Japan. Card makers, retailers and advertisers have young people planning weeks ahead to make their ""Friendship Day"" buys in India, clicking their favorite online purchases on ""Singles Day"" in China, and even eating their hearts out at fast-food giant KFC in Japan for Christmas. Much as Thanksgiving has spurred businesses to create Black Friday (and now Gray Thursday and Cyber Monday) to get shoppers into stores, countries around the world have turned average dates on the calendar into must-buy events. We take a look at a few such engineered days that promise love and happiness through retail therapy -- and, of course, profits for the companies behind it. White Day, March 14: Japan, South Korea and Taiwan . Cupid aims his bow and arrows a bit differently in Japan and reverses the western ways of lovers. On Valentine's Day, or Barentain Dei in Japan, women indulge their significant others with gifts and chocolates. And so, on White Day, celebrated exactly a month after Valentine's Day in February, men are supposed to return the favor of love and the giri choco, or obligation chocolates. White Day was first observed over 30 years ago by Japanese confectionary companies, according to Japanese media. In a ploy to boost marshmallow sales in the country, they started encouraging men to gift them to their female lovers, as a symbol of gratitude. Today, the Valentine's return-gift can be anything white -- white chocolate, jewelry, lingerie, flowers -- not just gooey and tender marshmallows. This holiday for the heart has now spread to South Korea and Taiwan. Friendship Day, first Sunday of August: India . While July 30 is the official, recently-declared United Nation's ""International Day of Friendship,"" India celebrates it a few weeks later. The origins of Friendship Day in India though, are fuzzy at best. Some say the choice of day was cooked-up by Hallmark-founder Joyce Hall. Wherever the holiday came from, India's burgeoning youth and aspiring middle-class have welcomed it with open arms. It is frequently featured in Bollywood movies too. Typically, friends -- platonic or romantic -- exchange the popular friendship bands, woven hemp or jute bands meant to be tied on your friends' wrists. Retailers start their Friendship Day campaigns and deals weeks in advance. Flower vendors, restaurants, stores and e-commerce portals willingly add to the pomp and show, according to local media. On the day, the streets of urban India are teeming with young men and women on motorcycles, huddled in the popular markets, cafes and malls, celebrating this annual fÃªte. Archies (Hallmark's India partner), a leader in India's ""Social Expressions Industry"" with over 50% of the market share, has seen a continuous increase in its gift sales segment but a weakening greeting cards segment. Click Frenzy, November 20-21: Australia . In Australia, online retail trade site Power Retail launched a 24-hour sale website called ""Click Frenzy"" as the country's version of ""Cyber Monday."" The newcomer to this slew of commercial holidays was launched on November 20 at 7 p.m. local time and it was the first online shopping event in Australia. Clickfrenzy.com.au aimed at aggregating and posting deals from over 200 retailers and redirecting shoppers to company websites of participants such as Dan Murphy's, Camera House, Lenovo, Fila, Expedia, Dick Smith, Clinique, Roxy and Dell. On the big day, the website experienced technical glitches and crashed under volumes of traffic. Organizer Grant Arnott apologized to shoppers for the inconvenience on its Facebook page . The Australian National Retail Association told the Australian Financial Review that technical difficulties like this were common to many big sales overseas. Click Frenzy generated a 200% increase in revenue for some retailers that participated, according to Arnnet, an Australian IT industry news website. The eWay payment gateway reported a 240% increase in the worth of goods purchased in those 24 hours when compared to the same time the previous week. Retail names Target, Chemist Warehouse and Dick Smith Electronics saw a surge in online traffic during the limited period, with boosts of 160,000, 120,000 and over 90,000 visits to their sites compared to the Monday before the sale, according to a local marketing and advertising industry publication. The debacle still spawned a fury online from the public, with the #clickfail hashtag trending heavily on Twitter. Singles Day, November 11: China . China, too, has its own shopping holiday called ""Singles Day"" which also takes place on the November 11. Local reports say the day is dubbed as China's busiest online shopping day. It originated in the 1990s with college students who were inspired by the date as when written numerically (11/11), represent four single people. ""Singles Day"" is China's version of Valentine's Day for people without romantic partners who treat each other to dinners and gifts bought online. Companies that cash in on ""Singles Day"" include Alibaba Group. Over 10 million people shopped on Toabao, a subsidiary company of Alibaba. Another online retailer, Tencent's 51buy saw a seven-fold increase in trade since last year, according to the Financial Times. T-mall, an online sales platform said its sales reached 13.2 billion yuan (US$2.1 billion). It's also a testament to China's growing online market. China's online shopping population outranks the U.S. with 193 million versus 170 million, according to the Boston Consulting Group. KFC Christmas, December 20: Japan . An unusual custom of eating KFC for Christmas has made its roots in Japan. The American fast-food chain has become synonymous with Christmas dinners in the country and orders are placed as early as December. It all started when a western man in Japan substituted KFC chicken for turkey in his Christmas meal in the early 1970s, according to the company. In 1974, the company launched the ""Kurisumasu ni wa Kentakki"" (Kentucky for Christmas) campaign and the finger licking tradition has stuck ever since. The marketing tactic has proved so successful for the fast-food chain that KFC's Christmas meals can be ordered up to two months in advance, according to the Financial Times. KFC has a special Christmas menu, offering roast chicken, smoked chicken and barbeque chicken for the limited period. Buy Nothing Day, last Saturday in November: International . A day to trump them all has also taken shape -- ""Buy Nothing Day"" -- to counter the global and manic consumer. Created for people to oppose retailer-driven consumerism, the day was first observed in Mexico in 1992, and later in the U.S. in 1997, according to its organizers. In the U.S., it is the day after Thanksgiving and is meant to offset Black Friday. Internationally, it is celebrated on the last Saturday in November. Proponents of Buy Nothing Day cite various ethical, environmental, personal, and moral reasons to dissuade shoppers. ""Everything we buy has an impact on the environment,"" according to the UK-based Buy Nothing Day website. ""Buy Nothing Day highlights the environmental and ethical consequences of consumerism."" The Canadian not-for-profit, Adbusters Media Foundation is one of the main campaigners for what they call ""A 24-hour moratorium on consumer spending."" People are encouraged to cut up their credit cards, participate in zombie walks (wandering around shopping malls with blank stares), go on Buy Nothing Day hikes, Buy Nothing Day paddles, and basically, buy nothing.","Thanksgiving has spurred businesses to create versions of Black Friday's globally .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A foundation created by Ray Charles is suing seven of the late singer's children, accusing them of violating a deal with their father not to claim any rights to his estate. The brewing battle in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles centers on 51 songs written or co-written by Charles. These include ""I Got a Woman,"" the hit that brought him to national prominence in 1954, and ""A Fool For You,"" ""Mary Ann"" and ""What'd I Say,"" songs that topped the charts early in his career. The Ray Charles Foundation accuses the adult children of sending copyright termination notices to music publishers claiming they owned the songs, which the foundation contends it owns. Their ""improper"" claims ""created an enormous cloud"" over the songs' ownership, causing the ""extreme likelihood that the value of these copyrighted assets will be permanently damaged,"" the foundation's suit alleges. Charles created a $500,000 trust for each of his 12 children two years before his 2004 death in exchange for agreements from them that they ""relinquished and waived any further claims to their father's estate,"" the lawsuit said. The foundation supports research and education programs for the hearing impaired, as well as youth education programs, the suit said. ""The foundation depends upon the income received from the said intellectual property and contract rights to continue the wishes of Ray Charles,"" the suit said. Without the royalties from the music, it could not fund the programs, it said. ""The self-serving attempts on the part of the defendants to deprive the foundation of its said intellectual property and contract rights not only is contrary to the express wishes of their father and in breach of the agreement they signed and promises that they made, but is contrary to the best interests of those innocent parties who would be benefited by the grants made by the foundation,"" the suit said. The four daughters and three sons listed in the lawsuit allegedly are trying to exploit a provision in the 1976 federal copyright act that allows copyright holders a one-time opportunity to renegotiate older copyrights, the suit said. Charles renegotiated the copyrights in 1980, it said. ""Consequently, all of the termination of transfer notices served by the defendants pertaining to those musical compositions for which the 1980 agreement serves as a renegotiation are invalid,"" the suit said. Some of the songs were also written as ""work for hire,"" which are not subject to copyright renegotiations, it said. The foundation is asking for $500,000 in damages from each of the seven children and an order preventing them from claiming any rights to the music. The suit lists Marc Toberoff as the defendants' lawyer. Notably, he is also the attorney representing the estate of Superman co-creator Jerry Siegel in its copyright battle with Warner Bros. over control of the superhero's future. Toberoff's law firm did not immediately respond to a phone call and e-mail from CNN for comment.","The foundation accuses 7 of his children of wrongfully claiming rights to his songs .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- President Asif Ali Zardari of Pakistan is scheduled to visit India on Sunday, the first by a Pakistani head of state in seven years, amid thawing relations between the two nuclear-armed archrivals. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of India will host a lunch in honor of Zardari in New Delhi before the Pakistani leader travels to the shrine of a revered Sufi saint at Ajmer in Rajasthan state, officials said. Zardari's visit Sunday, a private trip, comes in the wake of Pakistan's recent promise to grant India ""most favored nation"" trading status. The South Asian neighbors have fought three wars, two of them over the Himalayan territory of Kashmir, since the 1947 partition of the subcontinent into Islamic Pakistan and Hindu-majority, secular India after independence from Britain. Last year, both nations pledged not to let their fragile peace process unravel again over the range of thorny issues that put them at odds. After meeting her Indian counterpart in New Delhi in July, the Pakistani foreign minister, Hina Rabbani Khar, said she believed that ""it is the desire and commitment of both the governments to make it an uninterrupted and uninterruptable process."" Their meeting came barely two weeks after three deadly explosions ripped through Mumbai, killing 27 people. The attack revived painful memories of the 2008 terrorist siege in Mumbai, for which India blamed Pakistani-based extremists. Pakistan was quick to condemn the 2011 bombings of Mumbai while New Delhi was careful not to point the finger at Islamabad. In 2004, the nations agreed to negotiations that cover eight issues, including Kashmir, terrorism and Pakistan's concerns over river dams on the Indian side of the border, which it sees as a threat to its water supplies. Since then, successive governments have held talks in an effort to end the historical acrimony. Singh and Zardari hailed results from the dialogue in September 2008 as the countries completed four rounds of diplomatic meetings. But engagements were suspended two months later in November 2008 after the terrorist assault on Mumbai, which left more than 160 people dead. Over the past two years, India and Pakistan have held a series of high-level meetings in their bid to put their peace dialogue back on track, a process considered crucial to regional stability ahead of the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan. In 2011, New Delhi and Islamabad agreed to resume talks. ""It's a win-win situation when Pakistan and India are engaging in dialogue, are talking to each other, and are building better cooperation,"" Mark Toner, a deputy spokesperson for the U.S. State Department, said Thursday regarding Zardari's upcoming India visit. Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani of Pakistan, who met Singh on the margins of a nuclear security summit in Seoul, South Korea, last month, also invited the Indian leader to his country. ""Zardari has chosen a visit to Ajmer as a reason to be in New Delhi,"" Sanjaya Baru, Singh's former media adviser, wrote in a column for the Indian Express on Friday. Baru suggested Singh ""could choose a visit to his place of birth, the village Gah, as a good reason to go to Lahore, and maybe even Islamabad."" Singh was born in Gah during British rule over the subcontinent. Today, the village is part of the Pakistani province of Punjab. Gen. Pervez Musharraf was the last Pakistani president to visit India, in 2005, upon invitation by Singh to watch a cricket match between the two countries. ""Nothing need come out of such visits. No joint statement, no agreements, no final solution. But each such visit and the ensuing dialogue will make it easier for both governments to walk down the road that Singh and Musharraf defined,"" Baru wrote. Other observers also said the Sunday lunch meeting between the Indian and Pakistani leaders was encouraging. ""The lunch being hosted by the prime minister for a Pakistani president on a private visit is a welcome step,"" said Uday Bhaskar, a strategic analyst. ""These gestures are in the long-term interest of India and that of the region.""","President Asif Ali Zardari will have a private visit with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh .

"San Francisco (CNN) -- Communication on Facebook started with the simple, emotionally vague ""poke."" Over the past eight years, many features have been added to the social network, multiplying the ways people can interact with each other. You can chat and message someone, tag them in a photo or a post, check them into a location, post on their timeline or mention them in your own posts. A negative side effect of all these exchanges is that the potential for miscommunications and conflicts has also boomed, ranging from an adult not liking how they look in a tagged photo to cyberbullying among teenagers. To make it easier to catch and resolve volatile situations early on, Facebook is changing how content is reported, the company announced Wednesday. It's giving users tools to better communicate their feelings and handle conflicts themselves. The changes are the result of collaborations with Yale, Columbia and Berkeley that involved months of research and focus groups with kids, teachers and clinical psychologists. The first change is specifically for 13- and 14-year-olds (you have to be at least 13 to sign up for a Facebook account). If a boy in that age range wants to report a mean or threatening post or image a schoolmate has put on Facebook, he can click ""This post is a problem"" (a new phrase chosen to replace the stiff ""Report"") and go through a series of casually worded questions to determine what kind of issue he's having and how serious it is. There's even a grid for ranking his emotions. Once he finishes the questions, a list of suggested actions is generated based on how pressing his complaint is. If the boy is more annoyed than than fearful, he might choose to send a pre-written message to the other person saying that the post makes him uncomfortable. If he is afraid, he will be prompted to get help from a trusted friend or adult. There are links to catch anyone who may be feeling suicidal and direct them to professionals and Facebook's own suicide chat hotline. ""We feel it is important that Facbook provide encouragement for kids to seek out their own support network,"" said Robin Stern, a psychoanalyst from Columbia University who worked on the project. ""The children tell us they are spending hours online... they are living their lives with Facebook on in the background."" Kids aren't the only ones who need a little help communicating their feelings on the Internet. Facebook looked at photos that are reported for removal by all ages, flagged for offenses like being pornographic, containing hate speech or depicting drug use. When they started to dig in, the team noticed images were frequently being flagged for more personal reasons -- someone didn't like how they looked in the photo, was embarrassed their boss could see them dancing on a table or maybe was just trying to wipe away evidence of an old romance. Usually when a photo is reported for violating community standards, it goes to a Facebook employee who has to determine what steps to take. That adds up a lot of requests. By expanding the options and directing people to ask the person who posted a photo to take it down, Facebook is putting its members in charge of their own issues and saving itself some resources as a bonus. ""How do you build in emotion, this ancient part of human nature, in to the Facebook site?"" asked Dacher Keltner, director of the Social Interaction Laboratory at Berkeley. Keltner's team worked with Facebook to add some feeling to the process, customizing the stock requests based on the reason for wanting the photo removed and how important it was to the offended party that it come down. The wording was made more polite and the recipient given pre-writen answers to choose from too, opening up a dialog between the two sides. The changes aren't the most major Facebook has made, or even the most noticeable tweaks to roll out this week. But the shifts show the company is paying careful attention to the nuanced ways people communicate emotions on the social network. And by researching, changing wording and tracking response rates, it is also figuring out how to better engage its users. The motive was good, conflict resolution and helping kids, but the method could also have handy applications for delivering paid content. ""Language really matters and design really matters for this stuff,"" said Jake Brill, a Facebook product manager. ""The smallest change can have a really notable impact."" The changes have been available to many Facebook users as part of a test period and are rolling out to all U.S. members this week. Early statistics are promising: The rate of people completing the questionnaire when untagging an image has jumped from 48% to 78%. The team hopes to expand the program to other languages and countries but only after carefully recalibrating the wording for those cultures. The results of the studies were presented Wednesday (which was Facebook Compassion Research Day) in Menlo Park, California. The company's anti-cyberbullying push was started shortly after the Tyler Clementi suicide, though Facebook says it wasn't inspired by a single event.","Facebook adds tools to help adolescents deal with cyberbullying .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- A grandson of former President Reagan was arrested early Thursday at his home in Los Angeles, police said. Cameron Reagan, 31, was taken into custody by police responding to a house alarm at 12:20 a.m. (3:20 a.m. ET), said Officer Gregory Baek of the Los Angeles Police Department. There was a minor amount of force used, Baek said. Reagan was detained for resisting arrest and is being held on $10,000 bail. A spokeswoman for Reagan's father, Michael, said Cameron Reagan accidentally tripped his security alarm when he came home with four friends. The silent alarm alerted the police without his realizing it, spokeswoman Kirsten Fedewa said. Cameron Reagan heard a commotion in the front yard of his house -- which was not lit -- and saw people in dark clothing, Fedewa said. When he asked who they were, they responded ""Who are you?"" according to Fedewa. When he identified himself and reached for his identification, ""they thought he was going for a gun. They tackled and arrested him,"" Fedewa said. ""Where is the American Civil Liberties Union when Cameron Reagan is tackled in his own driveway?"" she said Michael Reagan asked. Michael Reagan, a conservative commentator, compared the incident to the arrest of Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr., at his home in July last year. The incident sparked a national debate about race. President Obama invited Gates, who is black, and the officer who arrested him, who is white, to a ""Beer Summit"" at the White House.

"(CNN) -- The leaders of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa -- collectively known as the fast-growing BRICS economies -- began arriving Wednesday in New Delhi amid protests from Tibetan groups against the arrival of Chinese President Hu Jintao. A Tibetan demonstrator who set himself ablaze in protest against Beijing died of his injuries Wednesday, officials at New Delhi's Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital said. Janphel Yeshi, 27, set himself on fire Monday and was hospitalized with burns to 90% of his body. Self-immolation has become a common form of protest for Tibetans who accuse Beijing of repression. More than 30 of them took place in the last year in China, Tibetan advocacy groups say. Authorities in New Delhi banned protest gatherings around the city's key government and embassy district where the BRICS summit will be held. Police were also dispatched to Tibetan communities where protests had flared up, police spokesman Rajan Bhagat told CNN. On Tuesday, police cordoned off some communities and a number of arrests were made, according to Indo-Asian News Service . Many ethnic Tibetans fled Tibet for India with the Dalai Lama in 1959 after a failed uprising. The BRICS summit on Thursday is expected to focus on greater economic cooperation among the five nations, including the creation of a development bank to fund projects and trade in the developing world -- a move viewed as a way to present an alternative to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. President Barack Obama nominated an American to lead the World Bank, despite calls from BRICS for the U.S. to break with tradition and nominate a bank chief from the developing world. BRIC was created as an acronym by Goldman Sachs economist Jim O'Neill to describe the world's fastest growing markets. Goldman Sachs predicts the economies of Brazil, Russia, India and China collectively could be larger than the G7 by 2027. This is the fourth summit of the BRICS heads of states. South Africa was asked to join last year, although many economists -- including O'Neill, who coined the term -- question whether South Africa has the global economic importance of the other four emerging economies.

"(CNN) -- In 2007, while serving as a Navy SEAL in Iraq, my team was hit by a suicide truck bomb. As I made my way through the debris of our barracks, ears ringing, choking on chlorine gas, I looked down and saw blood. I soon realized that the blood was not mine, but was from my friend Joel, who had been an arm's length from me. When I came home from Iraq, I visited with Joel and also went to Bethesda Naval hospital, to meet with recently returned wounded Marines. I asked each one of them, ""what do you want to do when you recover?"" They all told me, ""I want to go back to my unit."" The harsh reality, however, was that many of them were not going to return to their units. Their injuries were severe. They had lost limbs, the function of a lung, hearing. So I asked them, ""If you can't go back to your unit right away, what else would you like to do?"" One Marine told me that he'd like to return to his community as a football coach and mentor. Another Marine said he was considering becoming a teacher. Still another wanted to work at Bethesda, counseling other wounded veterans. As I left Bethesda that day, I knew that I was part of a long line of visitors and well-wishers that would pass through those halls, thanking veterans for their military service. But after my conversations, I realized that these men and women needed to hear more than, ""Thank you."" They also needed to hear, ""We still need you."" In order for their transitions back to their communities to be successful, in order to find the same purpose they felt in uniform, they needed to be challenged. At The Mission Continues, we challenge veterans to serve and inspire in communities across America. We are creating successful transitions by engaging returning veterans in six-month fellowships at nonprofit and public service organizations in their home communities. During their fellowships, our veterans are provided with a stipend, mentors, and an intensive curriculum designed to achieve one of three post-fellowship goals. They go on to full-time employment, full-time education, or participate in an ongoing role of service in their communities. In our program, Marine veteran Hiawatha Clemons returns to the same middle school he once attended, to serve as a tutor and role model for young students. Army veteran Rachael Gutierrez reconnects with her desire to serve, helping Habitat for Humanity build homes in Anthem, Arizona. Former Army cannon crewmember Kelvin McLemore responds to 911 calls with the Phoenix Fire Department, bringing assistance and comfort as part of the Crisis Response Team. To date, we have awarded more than 500 Fellowships to post-9/11 veterans, who have served with more than 300 organizations across the country. Our Fellows serve and they inspire. Together we've engaged more than 25,000 volunteers to work alongside veterans at service projects, bringing communities together in more than 40 states and the District of Columbia. Our program is having an impact. In two independent research reports, the School of Social Work at Washington University in St. Louis has found that nearly 80% of the participants in our program felt that serving in the community had a positive effect on their future employability, performance, and promotion, or that it instigated them to make a career change. In fact, 86% of participants reported transferring their military skills to civilian employment and 100% of Fellows reported that they will probably or definitely stay involved in volunteer activities and public service in the future. Our program is successful because diverse groups support our work. We are proud to have thousands of individuals donate their time and energy to spread awareness of our mission. They have volunteered at service projects and invested in our program. We are equally proud of the companies like Goldman Sachs, Boeing, and Target that make financial investments to fund our fellowships, and bring their employees out to service events across the country. Together, these groups make us stronger. We need their strength, because there is still much work to be done. With the end of the war in Iraq, and the drawdown in Afghanistan, our military is getting smaller. Over the next year, more than a quarter million service members will transition from the military. In order for veterans to transition successfully, more communities across America must recognize the service they still have to give. We believe that when the story of this generation of veterans is written, it will not only be a story of the wars they have fought overseas, it will also be a story of the homes built, the parks restored, and the young minds engaged by veterans whose mission continues in communities here at home.","Eric Greitens is an Iraq War veteran and former Navy SEAL officer .

"New York (CNN) -- New York City's Board of Health did not have the authority to approve a ban on certain sales of sugar-sweetened beverages larger than 16 ounces, according to a lawsuit filed Friday by a group of business owners and workers. The suit from the American Beverage Association and other business and trade associations states that the city's unelected Board of Health overstepped its power when it voted for the ban to be implemented. ""This board has the authority to enforce policy, not the authority to enact it,"" said Caroline Starke, a spokeswoman for the plaintiffs. ""That power is reserved for the City Council."" The lawsuit also claims that ""the regulation is arbitrary and capricious,"" is filled with irrational exclusions and loopholes, and harms thousands of small businesses in the city. The Board of Health was not immediately available for comment Friday. The ban, which was approved last month, would outlaw drinks larger than 16 ounces at restaurants, food carts and any other establishments that receive letter grades for food service. It would not apply to grocery stores. It is scheduled to go into effect in March. Critics, including McDonald's and Coca-Cola, have assailed the ban as ""misguided"" and ""arbitrary,"" though Mayor Michael Bloomberg has billed it as both a health and fiscal initiative. New York City spends an estimated $4 billion each year on medical care for overweight people, Bloomberg has said. One in eight New Yorkers also suffers from diabetes, a disease often linked to obesity, his office noted, calling sugary drinks ""the single largest driver of these alarming increases in obesity.""

"Benghazi, Libya (CNN) -- Three days before the deadly assault on the United States consulate in Libya, a local security official says he met with American diplomats in the city and warned them about deteriorating security. Jamal Mabrouk, a member of the February 17th Brigade, told CNN that he and a battalion commander had a meeting about the economy and security. He said they told the diplomats that the security situation wasn't good for international business. ""The situation is frightening, it scares us,"" Mabrouk said they told the U.S. officials. He did not say how they responded. Mabrouk said it was not the first time he has warned foreigners about the worsening security situation in the face of the growing presence of armed jihadist groups in the Benghazi area. The main building in the compound is in charred ruins. Disagreement over how attack began . The suite where the body of the ambassador was found was protected by a large door with steel bars; the windows had steel bars. His body was recovered after looters broke into the room. It appears his security detail left him in the room while they tried to deal with the attack. There are numerous questions about what happened at the consulate where protesters had gathered to demonstrate against the film ""Innocence of Muslims,"" which reportedly was made in California by a filmmaker whose identity is unclear. Chief among the questions is what happened to U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, who went missing during the attack. The State Department has not released details about how Stevens died, though numerous media reports have said the ambassador was taken from the consulate to the Benghazi medical center by locals. Clinton demands Arab Spring nations protect embassies . He arrived at the hospital, according to the reports, unresponsive and covered in soot from the fire. A doctor was unable to revive him and declared him dead, the reports said. According to one of the Libyan security guards who was stationed at one of the gates armed with only a radio, the assault began simultaneously from three directions. Heavy machine guns and rocket -propelled grenades were used, according to the guard. He said masked men threatened to kill him at gunpoint for 'protecting the infidels. He declined to appear on camera for fear of repercussions. Ex-SEALs among Benghazi dead . The February 17th Brigade -- a militia connected to the government but not part of Libya's armed forces -- was closely involved in the rescue of the American staff trapped after the attack Tuesday night. After the consulate was attacked and set on fire, a number of Americans escaped to a safe-house in another part of the city. But that came under attack too. Mabrouk said he received a call from an official in Tripoli, who said he had been called by a ""terrified"" American in Benghazi. The official was at the safe-house. Mabrouk says the Brigade asked the Americans if they needed help -- but were told that while the situation was dangerous, it was under control. A few hours later, Mabrouk said he received another call from Tripoli about the arrival of a U.S. team at Benghazi airport that needed transport into the city. He met the seven Americans, who were heavily armed but not in military uniform, on the runway and provided them with an armed escort, he said. As soon as the two vehicles carrying the seven Americans arrived at the safe house, they came under intense attack -- including a volley of grenades and machine-gun fire. The assailants then fled. The Libyan government has vowed to bring the perpetrators of the attack to justice. But on a visit to the heavily-damaged consulate, the country's president said Libya expected help form its friends in the international community. Asked whether the government was not capable of controlling extremist groups, he responded ""You are not far from the truth.""

"(CNN) -- Former military leader Abdel Fattah el-Sisi took the oath of president Sunday and was greeted by a stock market rally of 4.7%. This move to military rule is seen as a path to stability and predictability that investors are craving for -- the EGX-30 is up over 75% in the past 12 months and a whopping 137% since the low point at the end of 2011. But make no doubt about it, the country's former military chief has a steep hill to climb to get Egypt's economy back on track. Unemployment, the budget deficit and inflation are currently running between 11-13%, making it difficult for el-Sisi to maneuver. The president and his new cabinet will need to push forward with structural and tax reforms to attract foreign direct investment. He has hired external consultants to advise on jump-starting growth, which closed out the 4th quarter of 2013 with a meager expansion of just under 1.5%. Alia Moubayed, Director of MENA Research for Barclays said on a recent visit to the Middle East that ""investors are worried about the ability of having a president and government that will be able to build consensus around reforms."" Companies want to be able to tap the region's most populous country of 85 million consumers, but according to Moubayed they worry those efforts may be ""further interrupted by political volatility and instability."" Monetary insurance . There are a trio of countries that have stepped in to provide a monetary insurance policy for Egypt. They have been so active since the ouster of former President Mohamed Morsi that they are now referred to as the GCC-3 (Gulf Cooperation Council) or G-3. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the UAE share two common traits: A disdain for the Muslim Brotherhood (and its affiliates in the Gulf) and vast oil surplus funds to try and solve political challenges. Together they have pumped in an initial $12 billion and there is a great deal of talk in the market that they are prepared to do so again if needed. As of the end of April, Egypt's foreign exchange reserves stood at $17.5 billion -- a three-month supply. They are eager to manage this period of transition to try and provide both the infrastructure and governance for sustainable growth. This year, UAE-based developer Arabtec signed a $40 billion agreement to build low income housing in Egypt, and the government put in another $5 billion to construct wheat silos to reduce wastage of their grain crops. These governments and their entities, sources say, don't plan to be the lenders of last resort forever and this time they may not have to. Last Thursday, IMF managing director Christine Lagarde talked on the phone with el-Sisi and expressed her organization's commitment to helping the country in its transition period. The sticking point over the last three years of ""on again, off again"" talks has been a willingness to bite the bullet on economic reforms. After the Arab Spring chaos, this may be the former military leader's toughest test. He needs to illustrate to his Gulf partners and the IMF he has the mettle to deliver painful reforms and keep Egyptians on his side.","Stock markets rallied as Abdel Fattah el-Sisi assumed Egypt's presidency .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Frank Woodruff Buckles was just 15 years old when he joined the U.S. Army. Soon, he was deployed to war and headed overseas on the Carpathia -- the same ship used in the rescue mission of the Titanic. World War I veteran Frank Buckles entered the Army at age 15. ""I didn't lie,"" he said with a laugh this week. He drove ambulances in Britain and France for soldiers wounded during World War I. A few decades later, Buckles was in the Philippines as a civilian, on December 7, 1941, the day Japan attacked Pearl Harbor. He was taken as a prisoner of war for 39 months in Manila, eating his meals out of a single tin cup. More than 60 years later, he still clings to that cup, the one that sustained his life. Weathered with age, the cup has flecks of white paint chipped off. He keeps it as a reminder of his sacrifice for the country he so loves. He also still has his dog tags. At age 107, there's not much the war veteran, POW and West Virginia farmer hasn't seen. But this week, this quietly accomplished man was humbled. Buckles, the last known surviving World War I U.S. veteran, met the president of the United States and received a standing ovation at the Pentagon. ""I didn't lie; nobody calls me a liar,"" he said with a chuckle, referring to how he became a soldier at just 15. Speaking with a hushed, deep voice, he conceded, ""I may have increased my age."" He spoke from a wheelchair, dressed in a dark blazer with his military medals pinned over his heart. Those in attendance clung to his words. ""We cherish the chance to say thank you in person to Cpl. Frank Buckles,"" Defense Secretary Robert Gates said, before unveiling a portrait of him. At the White House, President Bush thanked him for his ""love for America"" and called him ""the last living 'doughboy' from World War I.""  Watch Bush honor a national hero » . ""Mr. Buckles has a vivid recollection of historic times, and one way for me to honor the service of those who wear the uniform in the past and those who wear it today is to herald you, sir, and to thank you very much for your patriotism and your love for America,"" the president said, seated with Buckles in the Oval Office. Buckles' tour of Washington was part of a series of events to honor the veterans of World War I, which included the opening of a photographic display at the Pentagon on Thursday. There will be nine formal portraits on permanent exhibition at the Pentagon. All were donated by David DeJonge who spent a decade finding and photographing the last of the World War I vets. DeJonge wants a more elaborate memorial in Washington to honor the veterans. For now, the only public site is an unpretentious gazebo near the Jefferson Memorial established by the city of Washington D.C. Buckles visited the site Thursday afternoon. Watch Buckles view the memorial . ""I think it was a very nice idea,"" he said after he and an aide toured the structure. But Buckles noticed the memorial is not national but built primarily to honor veterans from the District of Columbia. ""I can read here that it was started to include the names of those who were local,"" Buckles said. He was greeted at the site by two young Army Medical Corps candidates in training at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Maryland. ""It's just an honor to see somebody that served so much before us, to be in the same shoes as him, like, a century later,"" said Reeme Sikka, 22. One passerby, Vietnam veteran Zeke Musa, was embarrassed by the unkempt condition of the memorial. ""These guys served their country, you know. It's a shame,"" he said. According to an autobiography the Pentagon released, Buckles was eager to join the war. He said his recruiter in the summer of 1917 told him that ""the ambulance service was the quickest way to get to France,"" so he trained in trench casualty retrieval. Buckles eventually served as an officer's escort in France before joining a transport detail for German prisoners of war. He now lives on his family's cattle farm near Charles Town, West Virginia. By the end of Thursday, the last of America's World War I doughboys was clearly effected by the day's events. ""I feel honored,"" he said. E-mail to a friend . CNN's Paul Courson contributed to this report.","World War I veteran set sail on same ship used in rescue mission of Titanic .

"(CNN) -- A federal judge sentenced Colton Harris-Moore, whom authorities dubbed the Barefoot Bandit, to six-and-a-half years in prison on Friday for an infamous string of thefts and burglaries. The federal sentence will run concurrently with his state imprisonment of seven years and three months imposed in December, the judge ruled. The 20-year-old gained notoriety -- including 50,000 Facebook fans and a movie deal -- while leading authorities on a two-year manhunt while eluding capture in stolen boats, cars and planes, often while barefoot, authorities said. He once left chalk outlines of bare footprints at one crime scene. Harris-Moore pleaded guilty last year to federal charges stealing an airplane, piloting it without a license, burglarizing a bank and possessing a firearm as a fugitive. He also pleaded guilty in December to 33 state charges related to residential burglaries, identity thefts, a firearm theft, a car theft, attempting to elude a police vehicle and other offenses, according to court documents. He was sentenced to seven years and three months in prison on those charges. Prosecutors recommended that Harris-Moore get 78 months in prison on the federal charges, according to court documents. Harris-Moore had asked for 70 months. As part of the federal plea deal, he agreed to give up any profits that may come from book or movie deals on his story. His attorney has said Harris-Moore wants any such money to go to victims. He is estimated to owe more than $1.4 million in restitution in the federal case. Under the Washington state plea arrangement, he would also have to give up any proceeds for restitution on the state offenses, court documents said. He was arrested in July 2010 after crashing a stolen plane in the Bahamas and then trying to escape in a stolen boat. He'd been on the run from police since escaping from a Washington group home in 2008. His attorney has said that his client hopes to go to college one day to study aviation or engineering. CNN's Shawn Nottingham, Michael Martinez and Bill Mears contributed to this report.","The federal sentence will run concurrently with a state sentence of seven years .

"(CNN) -- People living in the Falkland Islands are voting in a referendum on their political status on Sunday and Monday at a time of heightened tensions between Argentina and Britain over their sovereignty. The two countries went to war over the territory, known to the Argentinians as Las Malvinas, in 1982 after the then-military government in Argentina landed troops on the islands. According to the Falklands legislative assembly, the vote is intended to affirm islanders' desire to remain a self-governing territory of the United Kingdom and to reject claims of ownership by Argentina. The question put to voters is: ""Do you wish the Falkland Islands to retain their current political status as an Overseas Territory of the United Kingdom?"" The two-day referendum is supported by the British government. But the Argentinian Embassy in London said in a statement Friday that the referendum had no legitimacy, characterizing it as ""a further attempt by the British to manipulate the question of the Malvinas Islands."" Because the area around the Falklands is the subject of a sovereignty dispute, it argues, ""the United Kingdom has no right to alter the legal status of these territories, not even under the guise of a hypothetical 'referendum.' "" Argentina's president condemns 'colonial rule' In January, Argentinian President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner wrote an open letter, published in the UK press, in which she called on Britain to hand back the islands and accused it of blatant colonialism. ""The Argentines on the Islands were expelled by the Royal Navy and the United Kingdom subsequently began a population implantation process similar to that applied to other territories under colonial rule,"" she wrote. ""Since then, Britain, the colonial power, has refused to return the territories to the Argentine Republic, thus preventing it from restoring its territorial integrity."" She cited a 1965 U.N. resolution inviting the two countries to negotiate a solution to the sovereignty dispute and has called on the British to abide by the resolution. The British government rejected Fernandez's call for negotiations, saying the Falkland Island residents have chosen to be British and ""have a right to self-determination as enshrined in the U.N. Charter."" The January statement added: ""There are three parties to this debate, not just two as Argentina likes to pretend. The islanders can't just be written out of history. ""As such, there can be no negotiations on the sovereignty of the Falklands Islands unless and until such time as the islanders so wish."" The British government accuses Buenos Aires of trying to ""coerce"" the Falkland Island residents into becoming part of Argentina through intimidation of those involved in fishing and oil exploration, and efforts to isolate the remote islands even further by limiting access by sea. Long desired for its natural resources . Located in the South Atlantic Ocean, about 480 kilometers (298 miles) east of the tip of South America, the Falklands have long been coveted as a strategic shipping stopover and potential wellspring of natural resources, including lucrative fisheries and a growing oil drilling industry. The islands, which raise their own taxes but rely on the United Kingdom for defense and foreign policy, are one of 14 British Overseas Territories and have been under British rule since 1833. More than 2,500 people from more than 60 nations live and work there, according to the islands' government website, as well as forces stationed at the British military's Mount Pleasant Complex. Many Falkland Island residents are of British origin. War broke out over the territory in 1982, when the then-Argentinian military government landed troops on the islands. Argentina put its death toll from the conflict at around 645. Britain's civil and military losses amounted to 255. On its official website, the Falklands government rejects as false the Argentinian government claim that a civilian population was expelled by Britain in 1833 and argues for the inhabitants' right to choose their path. ""The people expelled were an illegal Argentine military garrison, who had arrived three months earlier,"" it says. ""The civilian population in the Islands, who had sought permission from Britain to live there, were invited to stay. All but two of them, with their partners, did so. ""We are not an implanted population. Our community has been formed through voluntary immigration and settlement over the course of nearly two hundred years. ... We are no more an implanted population than are the various populations of South America whose ancestors arrived as immigrants from Europe -- we arrived here as part of the same process and pattern of migration."" The islands are economically self-sufficient, the government says, except for the cost of defense needed as a result of ""the claim made by an aggressive neighbour."" ""The Falkland Islanders are a peaceful, hard-working and resilient people. Our society is thriving and forward-looking. All we ask is to be left in peace to choose our own future, and responsibly develop our home for our children and generations to come,"" the government says.

"(CNN) -- Five Guantanamo prisoners accused in the September 11, 2001, terror attacks on the U.S. staunchly defended their actions, calling the operation ""blessed"" and ""great"" and the accusations against them ""badges of honor."" Khalid Sheikh Mohammed is shown in a courtroom sketch at Guantanamo Bay in January. ""You are the last nation that has the right to speak about civilians and killing civilians,"" the five said in a response this month to the U.S. government's war crimes charges. ""You are professional criminals, with all the meaning the words carry,"" the response said. ""Therefore, we will treat you the same. We will attack you, just like you have attacked us, and whomever initiated the attacks is the guilty party.""

The five are members of the al Qaeda terror network. Mohammed, who has taken credit for planning the attack, and the four other prisoners call themselves members of the 9/11 Shura Council. ""With regards to these nine accusations that you are putting us on trial for; to us, they are not accusations. To us they are badges of honor, which we carry with pride. Many thanks to God, for his kind gesture, and choosing us to perform the act of Jihad for his cause and to defend Islam and Muslims,"" the response stated. Reacting to the charges of ""attacking civilians,"" ""attacking civilian objects"" and ""deliberately causing grave bodily harm,"" the five asked who really pursued such actions. ""Is it us, or is it you?"" It ties the United States to attacks in ""Palestine and Lebanon by providing political, military, and economic support to the terrorist state of Israel, which in turn, is attacking unarmed innocent civilians."" It also noted American actions in Iraq and the dropping of atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. As for ""crimes in violation of the law of war,"" it cites Israeli occupation of Palestinian and Lebanese land and the displacement of Palestinians, the occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan and the mistreatment of prisoners at places such as the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. Answering another accusation, hijacking and/or endangering a vessel or an aircraft, the five said, ""if you do not respect the innocent in our countries, then we will do the same, by exposing you to danger and hijacking in the air, at sea and at land."" Quranic verses were cited in the filing, and the men underscored their defense of ""oppressed"" Muslims. ""Our religion is a religion of fear and terror to the enemies of God: the Jews, Christians and pagans. With God's willing, we are terrorists to the bone.""

"Pontiac, Michigan (CNN) -- Lamont Butler is a single father, unemployed for more than a year and trying to do the best for his daughter, 3-year-old Samaya. The family qualifies for the federal government's free pre-kindergarten program, Head Start, but has been on a waiting list for more than a year. It's tough on both of them; Butler has trouble finding work because he's caring for his daughter, and he worries Samaya is missing out on valuable early education. ""My friend's son got in, and at 4, he can already spell his name, do simple math, and he isn't so shy any more,"" Butler said. But Butler's daughter is one of thousands on waiting lists for the 49,000 Head Start classrooms around the country - a list that might get shorter after an investigation into allegations of fraud by some applicants and Head Start workers. A U.S. Government Accountability Office investigation that concluded in May showed that several Head Start workers committed fraud to enroll families whose incomes were above the federally mandated limit. Head Start is open to foster and homeless children, kids with some disabilities, families eligible for government assistance and families with incomes below the federal poverty guideline, about $22,000 for a family of four. Programs may enroll limited numbers of kids whose parents make more money. $9 billion went to support Head Start in 2010, and more than 900,000 children are enrolled in programs around the United States. The investigation began two years ago, after whistleblowers called the GAO's tip line and alleged that Head Start workers in the Midwest and Texas admitted families that made too much money to qualify. Documents that whistleblowers leaked to the GAO showed that some workers admitted children whose parents made more than $110,000. In some cases, according to the GAO, workers may have lied or manipulated documents so their programs appeared to be within mandated enrollment targets. ""Taxpayers are being ripped off,"" said Greg Kutz, the managing director of forensic audits and special investigations for the Accountability Office. ""The real risk here is that the over-income children were being served, and the poorest children in our country are losing the benefit of Head Start."" A 10-year study released in 2010 by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services showed that Head Start kids are better prepared academically and socially to enter kindergarten. They have better language skills and are better at making friends and handling classroom settings. Parenting skills improved, too, among those whose kids were in Head Start, according to the HHS study. Head Start is popular, too, because it's free, while private preschools and day care can cost more than $10,000 per year. To investigate the complaints, Kutz sent staff members armed with hidden cameras to pose as parents interested in Head Start enrollment. When parents apply, they must present tax records, pay stubs or public assistance documents that prove they meet the federally mandated income standards. The investigators' documents showed they made too much money to enroll, but at eight of the 15 Head Start centers they approached, staff members pretended they hadn't seen the income levels, or they urged parents to lie. In a tape Kutz showed to Congress in May, one Head Start worker examined the investigators' documents and said, ""This is over income."" When the undercover investigators asked what to do, the Head Start worker suggested they didn't have to put both parents' incomes on the form. With a laugh, she added, ""I'm not supposed to say that."" Another staffer joked, ""Now you see it, now you don't."" Kutz said he doesn't believe these are isolated cases. ""It's pretty disturbing,"" Kutz said. ""I believe the system is very open to fraud."" The problem, Kutz said, is that Head Start workers only have to sign a statement that they've seen proof of parents' incomes. Federal rules don't require Head Start offices to keep income documents on file. ""If you want to go in and say you are unemployed, you could get benefits even if you were making $100,000 because [Head Start wasn't] validating anything,"" Kutz said. Not all Head Start programs have been letting the income rules slide. Michigan's Oakland Livingston Human Service Agency, where Lamont Butler hopes to enroll his daughter, has long kept copies of parents' income documents. ""Our goal is to exceed those standards"" for documents, said Lynn Crotty, the program's director. ""In always maintaining copies of proof of income in our files, that's enabled us to ensure that the families that deserve to be in the program are the ones who are getting into the program."" Yvette Sanchez Fuentes, Head Start's national director, said she took action immediately after learning about the federal investigation last spring. ""We know that what went on the tape, [that the worker] engaged in some fraudulent behavior,"" she said. Sanchez Fuentes said the system isn't broken. ""I think it's important to note those are individuals within those programs,"" she said. ""We know the majority of Head Start programs across the country are doing the right thing."" According to Sanchez Fuentes, Head Start officials advised local directors about enrollment procedures, bulked up on admissions training and now make unannounced visits to local programs. A new Health and Human Services tip line lets workers report fraud to the department, which oversees Head Start, instead of going straight to the GAO. ""[President Obama's] administration will not tolerate any type of fraud, waste or abuse,"" Sanchez Fuentes said. ""We will make sure that when we go out to see these local programs, that they are indeed doing the right things and that every federal dollar that goes to Head Start is not being misused."" Still, they have not yet taken Kutz's suggestion to change the policies about keeping income eligibility documents. The issue is up for a 90-day comment period, but the rule won't change unless Head Start leaders decide it's the best course of action. Demand for Head Start remains strong, even in programs where there's no suspicion of fraud. For parents like Butler and kids like Samaya, that means the wait continues. ""The time we spend together has meant the world to me, but the things I've taught her are only things I know,"" Butler said. ""I know they could do a much better job.""","An investigation into Head Start enrollment practices shows some centers enroll families who make too much money .

"(Southern Living) -- Your entire winter wishlist is here. Cozy fire casting shadows in an expansive lodge library? Check. Families snowshoeing into a thicket of evergreens? Check. Old-timers dropping lines into holes cut from a frozen lake? Check. You can even find dogsledding and sleigh rides. All this in a postcard-ready setting: the 3,900-acre Deep Creek Lake, surrounded by Maryland's mountains and dusted with an average snowfall of 120 inches. (That's twice as much as Denver, Colorado, and Fairbanks, Alaska!) Here's our guide to planning a frosty yet cozy winter weekend. Southern Living: Escape to the coast . Where to Stay: . Lake Pointe Inn . Set on the shore of Deep Creek Lake, Lake Pointe Inn has nailed the yin and yang of a winter retreat. The Arts and Crafts-style bed-and-breakfast has a wraparound porch with views of the lake, while a massive stone fireplace dominates the lobby. Outside, a fire pit in the snow is fully stocked with marshmallows. Every detail speaks of this inn's devotion to comfort, from rooms with gas fireplaces and lake-view balconies to the comfort food: pumpkin flapjacks and egg scrambles by morning and a complimentary happy hour with wine and hors d'oeuvres each eve. Savage River Lodge . The Savage River Lodge may be a 45-minute drive from the lake, but this full-service resort is a destination all on its own. Sitting on the Eastern Continental Divide, the lodge enjoys lake-effect snow, with access to 13 miles of groomed cross-country ski and snowshoe trails. A double-sided stone fireplace warms a three-floor lodge complete with an impressive library, a full bar and a restaurant that leans heavily on local fare (wild game meatloaf, anyone?). Sign up for one of the lodge's all-day culinary classes and you can even be chef for a day. Southern Living: The South's best new hotels . Deep Creek Rental Cabins . For large groups, a cabin makes the ideal winter base camp. From shoreline homes to slope-side rentals, some cabins come equipped with hot tubs, bonfire pits, game rooms and even in-home movie theaters. We found a five-bedroom lodge with a hot tub, pool table, wood-burning fireplace and views of the lake. Where to Play: . Swallow Falls State Park . Strap on a set of snowshoes (it's as easy as walking, we swear!) for a two-hour guided hike through an old-growth hemlock forest in Swallow Falls State Park. Your ultimate destination is Muddy Creek Falls, the highest waterfall in Maryland, which, with any luck, will be frozen during your winter visit -- a spectacular photo op. Consider signing up for the four-hour Nature Photography Tour, which includes camera instruction from a pro nature photographer. Savage River Lodge . There's no shortage of cross-country trails in the Deep Creek Lake area, but the most civilized option might be at Savage River Lodge, where in-house rentals and lessons make the experience a cinch for beginners. To entice visitors even further, co-owner Mike Dreisbach has set up a warming station with a bonfire pit and benches where skiers can rest and guests can roast marshmallows. Southern Living: 10 best getaways . Husky Power Dogsledding . The Siberian huskies at Husky Power Dogsledding may be the happiest locals in Deep Creek. ""We're the only commercial dogsledding outfit below the Mason-Dixon,"" says co-owner Linda Herdering. Choose from a 10-minute jaunt to a two-hour excursion, and hang with the dogs while learning about the sport. Wisp Resort . Wisp Resort, Maryland's only downhill ski area, offers 132 acres of skiing, almost half of which is designed for beginner skiers and boarders. Head for the North Camp Trails, almost entirely devoted to new skiers, and combine Backbone Pass with Big Dipper for 1Â½ miles of gentle terrain with pastoral views. Go during the week to avoid the crowds and score a deal. Pleasant Valley Dream Rides . Does it get any cozier than snuggling beneath a blanket while sipping hot chocolate in a horse-drawn sleigh? Hardly. Pleasant Valley Dream Rides offers sleigh rides on a gorgeous family-owned farm throughout the day, but we say reserve a private excursion under the stars. Where to Eat: . Mountain State Brewing Company . Mountain State Brewing Company serves creative wood-fired flatbread pizzas, such as the Buffalo Chicken (with grilled chicken, Buffalo sauce and blue cheese) and such treats as the s'mores dessert pizza made with Nutella, graham crackers and marshmallows. The beer's good too, handcrafted by two West Virginia brothers. Try their Almost Heaven Amber Ale, a caramel-flavored brew. Will O' the Wisp . The Four Seasons at Will O' the Wisp is the local go-to spot for an intimate dinner. The restaurant sits inside the family-owned Will O' the Wisp Resort (owned by the same family who started Wisp Resort in 1955) and has been a local institution for decades. Even more surprising than the restaurant's longevity is the kitchen's eclectic from-scratch menu, with items as varied as berry-blackened tuna and tomato-basil tofu. Call ahead to reserve one of the handful of tables overlooking the lake. Southern Living: 101 free things to do in the South .

"(CNN) -- I despise Rush Limbaugh. I despise almost everything I have ever heard him say. I wish that he were no longer on the air. That is why I write today to defend him against those who call for him to be silenced. Far too frequently, Americans find offense in another's art, music or other expression, and then they call for censorship. This is intolerable. The First Amendment stands for principles like that espoused by the Supreme Court in West Virginia v. Barnette: ""Of there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein."" Or that wisdom given to us by New York Times v. Sullivan, ""Debate on public issues ... [should be] ... uninhibited, robust, and wide-open."" The First Amendment requires neither tact nor politeness. It requires that we permit all views to set up stalls in the marketplace of ideas, and we let that marketplace decide which ideas prevail. Rush Limbaugh has a right to his views. Just as important, his fans have a right to hear him. Those of us who disagree with him have a right to fight him, but we must do so on our own. Using the government to support our view is constitutionally intolerable. Trying to bully him off the air is wrong. Some call for the Federal Communications Commission to pull Clear Channel's broadcast licenses if they keep Limbaugh on the air, because they believe that Rush Limbaugh does not ""serve the public interest."" This is inaccurate and not permissible under the Constitution. It is a terrifying prospect that the government might review the political and social positions of a broadcaster when deciding who gets access to the airwaves. Should the government censor books that it finds to be unpopular or offensive? Opinion: FCC should clear Limbaugh from airwaves . There is the argument that with a limited number of radio frequencies available, broadcasters should use them in the ""public interest."" But how would these would-be censors expect the FCC to make that determination? Should there be a ""politeness test?"" Would this ban programming featuring George Carlin, Bill Maher, Lenny Bruce or Snooki? These would-be-censors want Limbaugh off the air because he does not serve their interests. That doesn't mean he doesn't serve a ""public interest."" There is no clearer ""public interest"" than the dissemination of political speech. Limbaugh brings together millions of listeners who share his views. If that is not the ""public interest,"" then what is? Another way to get Limbaugh off the air is to try and pressure his syndicator or his advertisers -- gathering people of like mind to use their collective economic power to force Limbaugh off the air. This is constitutionally tolerable, but morally wrong. If you disagree with someone who is on stage, it is wrong to stand up and yell to drown out his voice. This improperly interferes with your fellow citizens' right to receive information. Limbaugh's audience has a right to hear him. Drowning out his voice by organized bullying is no way to pay tribute to our most cherished liberty. It may be your right to do so, but it doesn't make it the right thing to do. Should the marketplace of ideas lose a stall because someone in it said some ""naughty words?"" Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. wrote: ""When men have realized that time has upset many fighting faiths, they may come to believe even more than they believe the very foundations of their own conduct that the ultimate good desired is better reached by free trade in ideas -- that the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market, and that truth is the only ground upon which their wishes safely can be carried out. That at any rate is the theory of our Constitution."" The challenge in this view is that it requires hard work on the part of those who wish to beat Limbaugh. It requires us to place our ideas into competition with Limbaugh's. I despise Limbaugh not because he uttered one or two nasty words, but because his views are truly evil. I debate those who agree with him. I place my ideas into the marketplace, and I believe that ideas like mine will win out. I realize that my work is difficult, and I may not even live to see Limbaugh's ideas repudiated. But my commitment to free expression requires me to engage his ideas, to parry them and to let my beliefs stand on their own -- without using the government or other improper means to tip the scales. Free speech means tolerating views that you despise. Otherwise, one day, it will be your views that someone doesn't like. If you don't stand up for Limbaugh's liberty today, someone may come for yours tomorrow. Discredit him, but don't silence him. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Marc J. Randazza .","Marc Randazza says he can't stand Rush Limbaugh but will defend his right to be heard .
He says the First Amendment doesn't require politeness; it requires right to express ideas .

"(CNN) -- These days, some of the best running trails can be found in the world's busiest places. Which is great news for time-crunched business travelers who want to keep up with their fitness routines while seeing a bit of the city they're visiting. Here are some of the world's best urban running trails that allow you to experience both nature and architecture. The High Line (New York) This much-hyped 2.3-kilometer-long linear park sits on a disused section of the New York Central Railroad and connects Gansevoort Street in the Meatpacking District with 34th Street. ""I love running the High Line for many reasons,"" says Katie Shea, a member of the New York Road Runners. ""It's an amazing green space high above street level, so you're not only getting the chance to be out in nature, but you're taking in views of the Hudson River and the Empire State Building, along with other skyscrapers. ""There are several art installations, so it's like running through an outdoor museum."" Starting point: Gansevoort Street . Riverside (Shanghai) The seven-kilometer Xuhui Riverside is a shiny strip of tarmac alongside the Huangpu River that has a designated lane for runners. The route starts from the Xuhui Riverside Public Open Space, near the Chuanchang Lu metro station, and finishes near Expo Zone C. Highlights include the luxurious turreted apartment blocks near Huangpu and, on the final stretch, views of the arched Lupu Bridge. Starting point: Xuhui Riverside Public Open Space, Longteng Avenue . Mont-Royal (Montreal) Montreal's 200-hectare Mont-Royal park is crisscrossed with a network of running trails. The Golden Square Mile area is the greenest section. More advanced runners head to Avenue des Pins and follow the signs for Belvedere and Chalet. This trail leads up the mountain, but the views from the top -- Montreal's highest point -- make the effort worthwhile. ""Mont-Royal is centrally located, making it easily accessible,"" says Paul Gantous, president of the Boreal Runners Club. ""The unpaved roads are easy on the joints, although the slope at times can be challenging when you're making your way up to the top of Mont-Royal."" Starting point: 1260 Remembrance Road . Hong Kong Trail (Hong Kong) The Hong Kong Trail has a total length of 50 kilometers but can be easily broken down into shorter stretches. ""Starting from the Peak, the first half is a gradual descent through dense tropical woodland, crossing occasional streams and offering brief glimpses of the city below,"" explains Peter Hopper, a member of Hong Kong's Italia Running Club. ""The second half includes steep exposed climbs over some of the island's highest peaks, with 360-degree views. The finish in Big Wave Bay is the perfect place to relax."" Those looking for something light can start with the easygoing Section #1 -- a seven-kilometer stretch that begins at the Peak and finishes at the Pokfulam Reservoir. Starting point: Victoria Peak . Trinity Skyline Trail (Dallas) With stunning views over downtown Dallas, the 7.4-kilometer Trinity Skyline Trail starts at the Joppa Preserve's Lemmon Lake in the city's outskirts and finishes at the Trinity River Audubon Center downtown. ""What makes this such a great trail is that it's so conveniently located near the hustle of the downtown area, yet it still gives you that nature feel,"" says Alex Delacruz from the Dallas Running Club. ""The beauty of the trail makes you forget that you're in one of the largest metropolitan cities in the United States, until you pause at the end of your run and see the sunset reflecting off the classic Dallas skyline."" Starting point: Great Trinity Forest Way, Joppa Preserve . Tennessee Riverwalk (Chattanooga, Tennessee) The 20-kilometer Tennessee Riverwalk is a linear park that starts at Ross's Landing in Chattanooga and finishes in the city center. ""I like that I can run 10 kilometers in one direction, then turn around and run 10 back, and the scenery changes constantly,"" says Courtney Bird, founder of Run Chattanooga. ""Not just when I change locations along the Riverwalk, but throughout the day as the sun comes out and it warms up. ""There's really nothing like watching the sunrise over the Hunter Museum or watching the city wake up from the Walnut Street Bridge viewpoint."" Starting point: Riverfront Parkway . New Orleans jogging tour (New Orleans) Running can be a great way to discover a city but if you don't want to go it alone, New Orleans offers organized running tours. Runs depart from the Old U.S. Mint building in the French Quarter and finish near the Garden District along the St. Charles Avenue streetcar tracks. The 90-minute tours start at 6 a.m. and 9 a.m., Monday through Saturday, and the route is 10 kilometers. There are several rest stops at some of the city's more famous buildings, such as the Old Ursuline Convent and the National WWII Museum. Neworleansjoggingtours.com has more information. Starting point: 400 Esplanade Ave. The Bay Run (Sydney) ""Sydney is a place with hundreds of running trails, from runs along the city's harbor to longer challenging bush trails in the chains of bush land that dots Sydney suburbs and outskirts,"" says Joe Degabriele, president of the Sydney Striders Running Club. Among these is the Bay Run, a trail in Sydney's western suburbs that loops around the lovely Iron Cove. In the past year it's been widened to allow more room for both cyclists and runners. ""It's a beautiful setting with flat separated footpaths over a seven-kilometer circuit,"" says Degabriele. Starting point: King George Park . Thames Path (London) The 289-kilometer Thames Path stretches from the Thames Flood Barrier at Woolwich in South East London to Kemble in Gloucestershire, but unless you're a superhuman, running the entire length in one go isn't really an option. We recommend tackling the 13-kilometer section winding from Richmond, on the outskirts of London, to Hammersmith in the city center. You can expect stunning views of the city, lots of wildlife and plenty of opportunities for an energy-boosting ice cream cone. Starting point: Richmond Riverside, Richmond . Yoyogi Park (Tokyo) Though temporarily closed, this 133-acre park, one of Tokyo's biggest, is usually open 24 hours a day in the heart of the city, making it a popular destination for post-work runs. Running paths inside the park are conveniently covered with distance markers so you can gauge your progress. The park is also popular with blind runners, thanks to volunteers who lead visually impaired runners. The trail provides a pleasant, compact circuit and the only off-limits area is the park's Meiji Shrine. If you can't wait til you get back to the hotel there are showers at the nearby Wired Cafe Fit outside the park's stadium. Starting point: 2-1 Yoyogi Kamizonocho, Shibuya. Meijijingumae and Harajuku are the nearest stations to the park. Check here for details about its reopening. Tamara Hinson is a freelance travel writer based in the UK.","It's possible to stay on your running routine even while visiting a big city .

"Las Vegas (CNN) -- Declaring victory in Nevada's Republican presidential caucuses on Saturday, Mitt Romney again turned away from his GOP rivals and toward President Barack Obama. CNN projects that Romney will win the Nevada Republican presidential caucuses, based on results and entrance polling. With 71% of the votes counted, Romney held about 48% of the vote, while former House Speaker Newt Gingrich had 23% and Rep. Ron Paul had 18%. Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, who had largely bypassed the state, had 11% of the vote. Those numbers were gathered from vote counters at caucus sites across the state and the state's Republican Party. See full Nevada results . Romney thanked supporters at his campaign headquarters in Las Vegas, telling them, ""This isn't the first time you gave me your vote of confidence, but this time I'm going to take it to the White House,"" alluding to his win in Nevada in 2008. But then he turned his attention to Obama, saying Nevada has had enough of his kind of help in fixing its home mortgage crisis and that he failed at bringing down unemployment. Entering the race as front-runner, Romney had largely ignored his Republican rivals and focused on Obama. But as Gingrich rose to challenge him in polls, he was forced to address the other candidates in the race. His victory speech was a one-on-one with Obama. ""This president began his presidency by apologizing for America. He should now be apologizing to America,"" Romney told cheering supporters. The only allusion to GOP opponents Romney made was when he told supporters that he was the only one who could fix the economy, ""unlike other people running for president."" Rather than the traditional post-vote speech, Gingrich held a news conference in which he accused the Romney campaign of spreading rumors that he would drop out of the race, calling it ""their greatest fantasy."" Gingrich reaffirmed his commitment to stay in the race, saying, ""We will continue all the way to Tampa,"" where the Republican National Convention will be held in August. Gingrich aides had said that he would outline a new campaign strategy that would be more positive. But while his tone with reporters was cordial, the message wasn't. Although he called his opponent a ""Massachusetts moderate"" instead of a ""Massachusetts liberal"" as he has in the past, Gingrich said he believed he was the alternative to Romney, ""who has in his career been pro-abortion, pro-gun control, pro-tax increase, and who ranks third from the bottom in creating jobs in the four years he was governor."" Gingrich downplayed the Nevada results, pointing out that Romney, a Mormon, did well in ""a very heavily Mormon state, a state which he carried in 2008."" He said Paul has a ""substantial advantage"" in any caucus state because of his organization. Gingrich said he wanted to run a more positive campaign, but that negative attacks were part of the game. ""I stayed relentlessly positive in Iowa, and I lost by 22 points,"" he said. ""I think it's terrible the American system is reduced to negative ads, some of them false."" ""But it's a fact, if you're not willing to stand and fight, you have to get out of the race."" Gingrich said he intends to compete for the GOP nomination in every state and will be matching Romney in the polls by the Texas primary on April 3. ""In a few more weeks I'll be ahead in Gallup again,"" Gingrich predicted. Romney's Nevada win makes him the first GOP candidate in this cycle to score back-to-back wins. The former Massachusetts governor appeared to win in the Iowa caucuses, but the contest was later awarded to Santorum when the vote was certified. Romney scored a big win in New Hampshire but was then stunned in South Carolina by Gingrich. Romney scored a 14-point victory over Gingrich and the rest of the field in Tuesday's Florida primary and entered Saturday's contest with a sizable lead in polls. The caucuses were open only to the state's more than 470,000 registered Republicans. Nevada's 28 delegates will be awarded proportionately based on the statewide vote. Polls leading up to the vote had shown Gingrich trailing far behind Romney. At one point, in the wake of his poor showing in the Florida primary, Gingrich advisers said he would concede the state and look down the road to more friendly states that vote in the March 6 Super Tuesday contests. But ultimately he chose to campaign in Nevada and didn't appear to make up much ground on Romney. As the votes were being counted, a leading Romney backer in Nevada was calling for Gingrich to drop out of the race instead of continuing to divide the party. Nevada Rep. Joe Heck, who has been closely allied with Romney since his 2008 presidential bid, said the results of the caucuses should be a wake-up call for Gingrich. ""I hope he takes the message that it's time to withdraw gracefully and not continue to divide the party,"" Heck told reporters in Las Vegas, shortly before the first caucus results were announced. While Romney's campaign and his network of supporters have voiced concerns about Gingrich's threat to remain in the race for the long haul, there has not yet been a chorus of Republican leaders publicly asking him to drop out. Heck was not as insistent, however, when asked if Paul should also bow out for the good of the party. Paul should quit when it becomes apparent that there is ""enough critical mass in terms of delegates,"" he said, probably sometime after Super Tuesday. Establishment Republicans fear that the longer the campaign goes on, the more the vitriol between Gingrich and Romney will result in a damaged nominee and give Democrats ammunition from Republicans themselves. Gingrich isn't expected to do well in the contests in February, but he could rebound on Super Tuesday, where he'll find friendlier voters in contests in Georgia, which he represented in Congress, Tennessee, and Oklahoma. The former House speaker's stunning victory in the South Carolina primary -- in which he erased Romney's double-digit lead in polls two weeks before the vote to win by double digits -- propelled Gingrich to the lead in national polls. But Romney and groups that support him bombarded Gingrich with negative ads and attack stump speeches, questioning everything from his ethics to his mental stability, and toppled him going into Florida. Asked Saturday night about the Romney campaign's tactics, Romney's son Josh said there were no regrets within the campaign about Romney's criticism of his rival. Politics is ""a tough sport,"" Josh Romney said. While Romney and Gingrich spent caucus night in Nevada, both Paul and Santorum are looking ahead to Tuesday caucus states -- Paul to Minnesota and Santorum to Colorado. Missouri also votes in a nonbinding primary on Tuesday. Asked about how long his campaign could run, Paul said even if he wanted to drop out of the race ahead of the convention, he couldn't because there would be a ""strong rebellion with my friends."" ""But we're doing so well there's no reason to think about that,"" Paul added. Campaigning in Colorado, Santorum told CNN that he expects to win one of the three events next week in Colorado, Minnesota and Missouri. ""I expect to win the nomination,"" Santorum said. ""I feel very good about how it is going. This race is a long way from being over."" The Silver State could almost be considered home-field advantage for Romney. He won the caucuses here four years ago in his first bid for the GOP nomination, grabbing 51% of the vote, far ahead of Paul, who was in second place at 14%. Romney won the endorsement Thursday of real estate mogul and reality TV star Donald Trump, who last year flirted with his own bid for the White House. Trump is a well-known figure in Las Vegas and his outspoken criticism of Obama has made him popular with some tea party activists and grass-roots conservatives. The state's strong tea party movement should have been Gingrich's trump card in Nevada, but supporters seemed divided between Gingrich, Paul and Santorum -- who landed the endorsement of Sharron Angle, the tea party-supported Republican Senate nominee who came close to unseating Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid in the 2010 midterm elections. The division of tea party supporters only helps Romney. Gingrich started up operations in Nevada much later than Romney and has been playing catch-up since. He does have some major allies in the state, including billionaire casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, who along with his family has contributed millions of dollars to an independent pro-Gingrich super PAC. The Silver State won't be in the rearview mirror of presidential politics for too long. Nevada is a battleground state in the general election, having voted for the winning presidential candidate 10 out of the last 11 elections. Obama beat McCain by 12 points here in 2008. CNN's Jim Acosta, Chelsea Carter, Candy Crowley, Phil Gans, Peter Hamby and Gabriella Schwarz contributed to this report .","In victory speech, Romney again focuses on Obama rather than rivals .

"(CNN) -- We'll have to wait a couple more months, safely after the election, to see Kathryn Bigelow's film about the hunt for Osama bin Laden, ""Zero Dark Thirty."" But in the meantime, director and star Ben Affleck and screenwriter Chris Terrio have found a positive spin on one of the least auspicious episodes in American foreign policy, the Iranian hostage drama that probably doomed Jimmy Carter's bid for a second term in 1980. The movie quickly and smartly fills in the back story, reminding us how Western powers propped up the monarchy in Iran until the Islamic revolution of 1979, a popular uprising that gave vent to anti-American fury in the region. Fifty-two U.S. citizens were captured in the American Embassy in Tehran -- but six escaped undetected in the melee and found refuge in the home of the Canadian ambassador. The challenge then for the CIA: how to get them out from under the noses of the ayatollahs. Enter Tony Mendez (Affleck), an ""exfiltration"" specialist (who knew?) who doesn't think much of the State Department's plan to send in bikes and road maps. Challenged to come up with something better, he concocts an improbable scheme about a phony movie: posing as a Hollywood producer, he'll connect with the six under the guise of scouting locations. It's far-fetched, but that's the beauty of it. Who would make up something like that? Anyway it's the best bad idea they've got. Artfully recreating the look and feel of '70s suspense films by accentuating the grain and resisting the impulse to blow stuff up every 10 minutes, Affleck has crafted a compelling middlebrow thriller that probably wouldn't have stood out from the crowd in that period, but which is easily one of the must-sees in 2012 -- a shoo-in for Oscar consideration. It's a well-paced and gripping entertainment certainly, even if you might roll your eyes at the contrived race-against-the-clock climax. More unexpectedly, and winningly, Affleck opens up a second front, a very droll insider satire on Hollywood hubris when Mendez enlists a makeup artist and producer to beef up his cover story. John Goodman and Alan Arkin work up a delicious comic double act, daintily skewering the rampant egomania of the movie business as well as its endless capacity for self-denial. ""If I'm doing a fake movie, it's going to be a fake hit!"" declares Arkin's Lester Siegel before reluctantly lending his name to a bottom-drawer sci-fi adventure script -- ""Argo"" -- which calls for a vaguely Middle Eastern cosmos. It's the very opposite kind of movie to the one Affleck makes. There's nothing showy or spectacular about his filmmaking. He puts the emphasis squarely on story and situation. He may not probe his characters very deeply, but they're believable victims of dire circumstance. He also casts very well: Bryan Cranston as Mendez's CIA boss, Victor Garber as the Canadian ambassador, Christopher Denham as the most skeptical and reluctant of the hostages. They're all absolutely on point. Affleck himself turns in a quietly impressive movie star performance. Tony Mendez is a kind of anti-Bourne, comfortable with his anonymity, living off his wits, not his fists. Smart, courageous and modest -- that's a rare combination in a man, and in movies, too.","Ben Affleck has crafted a compelling middlebrow thriller -- easily a must-see film .

"(CNN) -- Imagine you are sitting in your office simply doing your job and a nasty e-mail pops into your inbox accusing you of being a fraud. You go online and find that some bloggers have written virulent posts about you. That night, you're at home with your family watching the news and a talking head is lambasting you by name. Later, a powerful politician demands all your e-mails from your former employer. It sounds surreal. But it all happened to me. What was my offense? I worked on climate change research that indicated the world is a lot warmer today than it was in the past. Because that research caught the public's attention when it was released in 1998, I became one of dozens of climate researchers who have been systematically targeted by a well-funded anti-science campaign. Ironically, as these attacks have grown, the scientific facts have become ever clearer. Climate scientists know the world is warming and human activity -- particularly burning coal and oil -- is the primary driver. The idea of addressing climate change threatens some people in the fossil fuel industry. And a vocal minority of corporate interests and their ideological allies are spending a lot of money to hijack the public debate about climate change. I call all this the ""scientization"" of politics. Attacks on science and scientists are an effort to advance a political agenda, not an effort to better understand science or the risks it uncovers. The tobacco industry did it when scientists linked cigarettes to cancer. The lead industry tried to discredit a scientist who found that lead exposure hurt children's cognitive abilities. Now, it's climate scientists' turn. In the most infamous episode, somebody stole thousands of e-mails and documents from leading climate researchers, including me. They cherry picked key phrases from the e-mails and published them out of context, like a black-and-white political attack ad with ominous music. Fossil fuel industry-funded groups gleefully spread the e-mails online and badgered the mainstream media into covering the ""controversy"" they had manufactured. It was no accident that this happened on the eve of a major international climate change meeting. Saudi Arabia, the world's largest exporter of oil, was the first to call for an investigation. The dozen independent investigations that did follow -- all of which exonerated the scientists -- got much less media coverage than the original nonscandal. Last year, the inspector general of the National Science Foundation found the charges against me were all baseless and reaffirmed mainstream climate science. Larger political factors helped sink the climate change talks. But the stolen e-mail ""scandal"" has lived on. Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli (also a candidate for governor) cited it in his demand from my former employer -- the University of Virginia -- for all my documents and e-mails dating back several years. On March 2, the Virginia Supreme Court ruled in our favor -- a Pyrrhic victory considering all of the money and resources wasted that could have been invested, for example, in measures to protect Virginia's coastline from the damaging effects of the sea level rise it is already seeing. These attacks have prompted me to tell my own story in a new book, ""The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars: Dispatches from the Front Lines."" Before it even came out, a coal industry front group ran radio advertisements condemning my employer, Penn State, for allowing me to speak on my own campus. Later, a former tobacco industry apologist offered $500 to anyone who would ask me a challenging question at another talk and provide him with video. This is a silly -- and indeed, dangerous -- way to have a climate change debate in this country. What keeps climate scientists working away in our labs and in the field, is that we keep uncovering more evidence of how climate change will impact our planet and our lives. In the face of these attacks, scientists are doing more to speak out, forming a Climate Science Rapid Response Team to connect scientists with journalists and a Climate Science Legal Defense Fund to help scientists defray legal costs. Groups like the Union of Concerned Scientists are redoubling their efforts to defend scientists and advance public understanding of climate change. And scientific societies are starting to do more to help their members deal with the poisonous political environment around climate change. I first tackled climate science as a graduate student in theoretical physics, looking around for a topic that would be worthy of a lifetime's work. Attacked both professionally and personally, I became a reluctant public figure in the climate wars. And now, as the father of a 6-year-old girl, I want to make sure the planet we leave her is at least as beautiful and healthy as the one we grew up on. At the very least, our nation's political and business leaders deserve to have a debate about her future that is grounded in reality. My daughter, and all of our children, deserve no less.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Oscar-winning producer Richard D. Zanuck, whose films include ""Driving Miss Daisy,"" ""Jaws,"" and Tim Burton's ""Alice in Wonderland,"" died Friday at age 77 of a heart attack in Los Angeles, his publicists said. In 1991, Zanuck was awarded the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences' Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award, also given to his longtime associate David Brown. Given only 36 times in Oscars history, the award recognized Zanuck as ""a creative producer whose body of work reflects a consistently high quality of motion picture production,"" according to his representatives. The summer of ""Jaws"" Zanuck is the only second-generation recipient of the award, which also was given to his father, Darryl F. Zanuck. Earlier, Zanuck and his wife, Lili Fini Zanuck, won an Oscar as producers of ""Driving Miss Daisy,"" which was named Best Picture of 1989, his representatives said. The couple ran their own production firm, the Zanuck Company, formed in 1988, the representatives said. Zanuck was born December 13, 1934, to Darryl F. Zanuck and actress Virginia Fox, said publicists Jeff Sanderson and Dan Barry. After graduating from Stanford University and serving in the Army as a lieutenant, he joined his father as a story and production assistant on two 20th Century Fox films, ""Island in the Sun"" and ""The Sun Also Rises."" He became a full-fledged producer at age 24 with the feature film ""Compulsion,"" which garnered the Best Actor award at the Cannes Film Festival for the ensemble work of stars Orson Welles, Dean Stockwell and Bradford Dillman, the representatives said. At age 28, Zanuck rose to president in charge of production of 20th Century Fox and was then the youngest corporate head in Hollywood, his publicists said. In his eight years at that job, the studio secured 159 Oscar nominations, including for ""The Sound of Music,"" ""Patton"" and ""The French Connection,"" which all won Best Picture. Confessions of an Oscars geek . Zanuck became senior executive vice president at Warner Bros., where he and soon-to-be partner Brown oversaw ""The Exorcist"" and ""Blazing Saddles.""

In 1999, the Zanuck Company joined Clint Eastwood and made ""True Crime,"" based on Andrew Klavan's best-selling novel and a film in which Eastwood also starred and directed, the publicists said. In March 2000, Zanuck and wife produced the 72nd annual Oscar presentation itself -- garnering nine Emmy nominations and the highest network ratings of the previous six years, the representatives said. In 2001, Zanuck and his son Dean produced DreamWorks' ""Road to Perdition.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Some experts are skeptical that anything could have stopped Robert Hawkins from going on a murderous rampage at an Omaha, Nebraska, shopping mall on Wednesday. A police car sits outside the Westroads Mall in Omaha, Nebraska, on Thursday. ""This is not something that anybody can reasonably anticipate,"" said Don Greene, a former FBI agent who has written a book on mall security. ""If the people closest to him didn't see any indicators or signs that he was going to go off so drastically ... how is some public safety officer supposed to recognize this person?"" Greene asked. In fact, security at Omaha's Westroads Mall did find Hawkins' behavior suspicious before the shooting, Omaha Police Chief Thomas Warren said Thursday. Mall surveillance initially flagged Hawkins ""based on his actions"" when he entered the mall through the Von Maur store's main entrance on the second floor, Warren said. He said Hawkins exited quickly after entering, then re-entered within six minutes and appeared to be concealing something in a balled-up sweatshirt. He then went up the elevator to the third floor, and when he got there, he immediately began firing, Warren said.  ""It doesn't appear as though there was an opportunity for intervention,"" he said. Shopping malls around the country were expected to review their emergency plans and consider additional security measures in light of Wednesday's shooting, which killed eight.  Watch what experts say about keeping malls safe » . ""There is always a fear of copycats when something like this happens,"" said Malachy Kavanaugh, spokesman for the International Council of Shopping Centers. He said malls would be considering whether to close some entrances, bring in additional officers, and make security more visible. There are 1,200 enclosed malls in the United States and about 50,000 shopping centers. Although some include police substations, most are patrolled by unarmed private mall and store security guards. Should these private security guards be armed? ""Absolutely not,"" said Greene. Greene said if a security officer were to pull a gun on an armed individual in a mall, it could result in ""the gunfight at the 'OK corral,' and then we might have 23 people killed instead of eight."" ""These random events are very challenging to prevent and difficult to deal with when they occur. Law enforcement and security prevention measures, no matter how good, cannot forestall a tragedy such as this from happening,"" said a statement issued Wednesday night by the Simon Property Group, which operates regional and outlet malls across the United States. ""We do not disclose or discuss our enhanced security measures and/or procedures that we have in place or may institute at any given time, some of which are visible to the public, with others intentionally less noticeable,"" the statement said. ""Disclosure of such information could potentially compromise our efforts to provide a safe and secure environment."" Security expert Lou Palumbo told CNN one useful strategy was having trained law enforcement personnel watching people as they enter the mall. ""You start to observe the people coming into the mall area,"" he said. ""To let them in your door and then try to figure out what they're doing, you know, it's not as effective as catching them as they're coming in the door."" The International Council of Shopping Centers has conducted focus groups with shoppers to test how they would react to even tighter ""airport style"" security measures, including bag checks and magnetometers. According to Kavanaugh, the results have shown that shoppers would accept the measures only if the national threat advisory system was raised to its highest level, red. Such extreme measures are ""in the mall industry playbook ... but it is something no one wants to do,"" said Kavanaugh. While some mall owners have increased training of security personnel and have upgraded their emergency systems, many security experts believe more should and can be done. Those experts suggest it's a matter of money. They say until shoppers start staying away, mall owners will not make significant changes. There are no national standards for security guards, and according to a 2006 study by the Police Foundation, only a few states require background checks, minimum hiring standards, or training. The study also notes that drills to test security staffs' knowledge of what to do in an emergency, when done at all, ""are seldom rigorous, seldom done with first responders, and are usually done without clear standards to measure their success."" The report goes on to say that ""many malls do not even have plans to limit access to sensitive areas in times of heightened alert."" Since that report was written, the International Council of Shopping Centers, in conjunction with George Washington University, has developed a DVD to train mall security guards. According to Kavanaugh, about 6,000 of the nation's estimated 20,000 mall security guards have participated in the course, including 10 at Westroads Mall, where Wednesday's shootings took place. The FBI and other federal agencies have reached out to private security firms to share information on best practices. The FBI also sends out alerts regarding possible threats to the private sector -- but warnings of possible terrorist plans are clearly of no help in anticipating an attacker like Hawkins.

"(CNN) -- He is gay. He's a Republican. He wants to get married. During his time as a spokesperson for the Republican Party and GOP candidates, James Richardson noted that ""never once did I write that I am gay."" That changed with the publication of a column by Richardson in Thursday's Washington Post that openly proclaims his sexuality. Despite being a member and former spokesman for a party that doesn't support what he so badly desires -- to marry his same sex partner -- Richardson is committed to the GOP and committed to changing the party's views on the issue. While all six openly gay members of the U.S. House and one member of the Senate are Democrats, that could change in November as at least three gay Republicans are currently running. ""I'm advocating for change openly as a gay Republican,"" he said in an interview with CNN about why he decided to announce his sexuality. ""It brings some personal heft when you are convincing people that what they are doing is going to hurt you."" He wants to work ""from within"" to change minds and the law about same sex marriage, he said. ""My partner and I are envious subscribers to the conventional, conservative family model. Yet together, as two men wishing to grow grey and ornery in matching rocking chairs, we are consigned to 'cohabitation' as a consequence of law. That's unjust, and it's uniquely painful,"" he wrote in the Post. Richardson once worked for the more moderate Republican Jon Huntsman, who has embraced same-sex marriage. But he also worked for candidates adamantly against same sex marriage, including former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour's short-lived presidential exploratory campaign. Barbour has said he firmly believes that marriage is between a man and a woman. ""I strongly disagree"" with Barbour, Richardson said, adding that he respects Barbour's position. ""It's a matter of overlooking something for the broader picture."" Ken Mehlman, former adviser to President George W. Bush and former chair of the Republican National Committee, announced that he is gay in 2010 after he stepped out of the political spotlight and into the private sector.","James Richardson is a Republican and wants you to know that he wants to get married to a man .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Dogs bred for the fighting pit have only one thing in their future: death. Fighting dogs may die in the ring or at the hands of their owners. If they are confiscated in a bust, they are almost always euthanized, experts say. Of the 1.4 million dogs euthanized at shelters last year, roughly half were pit bull types, Merritt Clifton says. Thursday is the deadline for owners to retrieve any of the 50 remaining pit bulls seized in April from the Virginia property of suspended Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick, who is accused of using them in vicious dogfights. A federal judge is expected to issue a court order to euthanize the animals. Officials and animal rights advocates agree that the dogs must lose this last battle for their lives because of their brutal training and risks to people and other animals. ""They're just not in any situation where they can be adopted,"" said Dr. Lauren Adams, a veterinarian with Emory Animal Hospital in Decatur, Georgia. ""They can snap at any point."" Of the 1.4 million dogs euthanized at shelters last year, roughly half were pit bull types, according to the latest data from Merritt Clifton, editor of Animal People. The pit bull is not a breed but a type that includes American Pit Bull Terriers, American Staffordshire Terriers, Staffordshire Bull Terriers, and pit bull mixes, according to the Pit Bull Rescue Central Web site. Clifton and other experts estimate anywhere from 25 to 50 percent of pit bulls euthanized at shelters were fighting dogs. ""Those dogs have been bred for aggression. You can breed for certain physical traits, but you can also breed for behavioral characteristics,"" said Wayne Pacelle, president of the Humane Society of the United States. Dogs that lose the fights often are abandoned at shelters, but not all of them make it that far. Owners sometimes kill the dogs that don't win. Court documents from the Vick case say ""the losing dog was sometimes put to death by drowning, strangulation, hanging, gun shot, electrocution or some other method.""  Learn about the dark world of dogfighting » . If the dogs do make it to shelters, they are usually euthanized quickly. Keeping them alive puts a burden on shelters, which can be held legally responsible if anything goes wrong, and puts the other animals at risk.  Watch why some say euthanasia is the only option for fighting dogs -- viewer discretion advised » . ""It's very difficult to deprogram that behavior once it is instilled,"" Pacelle said. ""Even if you can do it to some degree, all it takes is one lapse in the animal's behaviors to kill another animal or exhibit some other type of aggression."" Additionally, shelters face the threat of theft. In the United States, there are an estimated 40,000 people who are considered professional dogfighters and another 100,000 amateur ""streetfighters,"" according to John Goodwin, an expert on animal fighting with HSUS. Those involved compete for prizes as high as $100,000, and confiscated pit bulls are extremely valuable. Inside the overpopulated shelters, where it's survival of the most adoptable, shelters focus their limited resources on the dogs that stand a better chance of finding a home. The stigma associated with pit bull types has victimized the ""good"" pit bulls, Pacelle said. In some shelters, as many as 60 percent of dogs are pit bull mixes. More than 90 percent of pit bulls in shelters -- fighters or not -- end up euthanized, said Clifton, who has been researching animal shelters for more than three decades. In the early 1900s, pit bulls were characterized as ""nanny dogs"" because they were used by families to baby-sit their children. ""By the end of the century, they were these horrible, aggressive, fighting dog machines, and that's very unfortunate,"" said Ed Boks, general manager of Los Angeles Animal Services in California. The secondary fighting market has contributed to over breeding of pit bulls, Clifton said. The market creates a place where people can sell dogs as disposable commodities -- like pigs or chickens -- at much lower prices than would be invested in a pet, he said. These disposable dogs are designed to fight until they can fight no more. ""It was back in the '70s, '80s and '90s when people discovered just how loving these animals are -- so loving that they would fight to the death to please their owners,"" Boks said. Considering the risk the fighting dogs pose to shelters, potential owners and other animals, ""they just don't have a chance,"" Clifton said. ""You can compare it to what happens with exotic cats and people who keep tigers in their backyard. It's not the tiger's fault, but you are still on the menu. They are victims, but you do have to treat them as animals that belong in maximum security."" E-mail to a friend .","Dogs that survive the fighting pit are almost always euthanized .

"(CNN) -- A new era in computing that will see machines perform at least 1,000 times faster than today's most powerful supercomputers is almost upon us. By the end of the decade, exaFLOP computers are predicted to go online heralding a new chapter in scientific discovery. The United States, China, Japan, the European Union and Russia are all investing millions of dollars in supercomputer research. In February, the EU announced it was doubling investment in research to â‚¬1.2 billion ($1.6 billion). See also: Super telescope to search for secrets of universe . What is an exaFLOP? Computer scientists measure a supercomputer's performance in FLOPS, an acronym for FLoating Point Operations per Second, while ""exa"" is a metric prefix which stands for quintillion (or a billion billion). An exascale computer could perform approximately as many operations per second as 50 million laptops. ""It is the next frontier for high-performance computing,"" says Dimitrios Nikolopoulos, professor at the School of Electronics at the UK's Queen's University of Belfast. How fast are today's supercomputers? Today, the fastest supercomputers operate at the petaFLOP level says Nikolopoulos, performing in excess of one quadrillion (or a million billion) operations per second. The first computer to break through the petaFLOP barrier was IBM's Roadrunner in 2008. But its reign as the fastest computer in the world didn't last long, with the Cray Jaguar installed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the United States becoming the quickest with a performance of 1.75 petaFLOPS in 2009. Today, the crown is held by is Japan's K computer developed by RIKEN and Fujitsu, according to TOP500 -- a project that tracks trends in high-performance computing. The machine, installed at the RIKEN Advanced Institute for Computational Science, in Kobe, Japan, currently operates at over 10 petaFLOPS. It is more than four times faster than its nearest rival, China's NUDT YH MPP computer (2.57 petaflops). How big are they? ""The kind of space that you need is similar to that of a football field. You're talking about many, many lanes of computer racks and thousands of processors,"" says Nikolopoulos. The K computer contains a mind-boggling 88,128 computer processors and is made up of 864 refrigerator-sized cabinets. Physically, exascale computing won't get any bigger, says Nikolopoulos, and might even get a little smaller. But the amount of processors will rise substantially to anywhere between one million and 100 million. See also: $35 PC size of a credit card . What are the challenges of reaching exascale? Nikolopoulos says ""severe technology barriers"" remain, the most important being power. ""Power consumption of supercomputers in general is not sustainable,"" he says. ""The current projections suggest that power consumption of exascale computers will be 100 megawatts. It's impossible to build a suitable facility and have enough power."" Historically, a computer's processor has used the most power (around 40-50% of the total) Nikolopoulos says, but memory is rapidly catching it up. ""Changing materials and also the architecture of processors and memories is critical to exascale's success,"" he says. ""We are beginning to understand the challenges of exascale in terms of hardware, software and applications. We are at the stage where we can make mental projections and set up directions for research."" What benefits could exascale computing bring? It will enable discovery in many areas of science, says Nikolopoulos. ""Aerospace engineering, astrophysics, biology, climate modeling and national security all have applications with extreme computing requirements,"" Nikolopoulos said. See also: Mapping the brain's secrets . Bill Cabbage, public information officer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, says exascale will attempt to tackle very serious challenges in energy supply and sustainability. ""These are very difficult problems and will require the development of new forward-thinking technologies to deal with them,"" Cabbage said. ""We are bringing all our resources to bear on these problems,"" he added. Social sciences could also profit, says Nikolopoulos. ""More and more people are interested in understanding the behaviors of societies as a whole. These require simulations -- how people interact, communicate, how they move. That will require exascale computing,"" he said.","ExaFLOP supercomputers will perform a billion, billion operations every second .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Another patient with Ebola is heading to the isolation unit at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. An air ambulance will fly the patient from West Africa and is expected to arrive on Tuesday morning, Emory Healthcare said in a statement. University officials said Monday that they could not reveal additional details because of confidentiality restrictions. The State Department described the patient as a U.S. citizen who contracted the disease in Sierra Leone. Earlier Monday, the World Health Organization said a doctor working in an Ebola treatment center in Sierra Leone had tested positive. WHO would not reveal the nationality of the doctor nor to where he or she was being evacuated. Last month, two Americans infected with Ebola were flown to Atlanta for treatment at Emory. They were given an experimental drug to fight the deadly disease and were later released from the hospital. Another American doctor infected with Ebola arrived in Nebraska for treatment last week. Officials have warned that the deadliest Ebola outbreak in history is hitting West Africa. WHO said Monday the rapid spreading of the virus in Liberia shows no sign of slowing. ""The number of new cases is increasing exponentially,"" WHO said, calling the situation a ""dire emergency with ... unprecedented dimensions of human suffering."" It's a crisis unlike any other during previous Ebola outbreaks, according to WHO. Taxis packed with families who fear they've contracted the deadly virus crisscross the Liberian capital, searching for a place where they can be treated, the WHO said. But there are no free beds. ""As soon as a new Ebola treatment facility is opened, it immediately fills to overflowing with patients,"" the U.N. group said. The Ebola virus causes viral hemorrhagic fever, which according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention refers to virus types that affect multiple organ systems in the body and are often accompanied by bleeding. Humans contract Ebola through contact with the bodily fluids of infected animals or the bodily fluids of infected humans. No vaccine or medicine has been proved to cure the disease, but the first human trial of an experimental Ebola vaccine began last week. More than 3,600 cases of Ebola have been reported since the first documented case in December, WHO has said. Of those cases, there have been more than 1,800 fatalities, the agency has said. More than 40% of the cases have been diagnosed in the past three weeks, the agency said. CNN's Miriam Falco and Debra Goldschmidt reported from Atlanta. CNN's Jamie Crawford reported from Washington.

"(CNN) -- Anything creative begins with a question. The problem is that questions take us into uncertainty, which is a very dangerous place to be. If there were a predator next to you and your brain wasn't absolutely sure what to do, then it'd probably be too late. The need to translate ambiguous sensory information into meaningful behavior has been the fundamental drive of brain evolution, without which survival in a complex world would not have been possible. And yet a deep irony is that the best questions -- i.e., the ones that challenge our deepest sense of what is true -- create the most uncertainty. So how is it possible to be creative? Fortunately nature gave us a solution, which in the context of human culture we call science. Not science reduced to the Methods section of a paper, but science as a ""way of being,"" where not only is uncertainty celebrated, but so too are possibility, diversity and openness. In other words ... play. Watch Beau Lotto's TED Talk . Armed with this idea that science is play (and thus experiments are games) I asked whether we could not simply teach children about science, but actually enable them to become the scientist and in this way offer children an essential tool for contending with the uncertainty that is inherent to life. The answer to this question was the Blackawton Bees Project. Through the course of several ""workshops"" spread over three months, Dave Strudwick and I went on a journey with 25 children aged 8 to 10 years old. The journey was broken down into several distinct stages, but what happened within each stage was an emergent consequence of the interactions with and between the children. The first step was ""Wonder,"" since without it there's no motivation to ask a question. The second was to ask ""Why?"" the third ""What If?"" and the fourth -- ""Who Cares?"" In other words, the focus was not on coming up with answers to questions set by a teacher (in which the answers are already known), but on asking questions -- novel questions -- that were of interest to the children. In this instance, those questions came in the context of bumblebee visual behavior. The children came up with the idea of seeing if bumblebees could learn to recognize different spatial configurations of color, which is important for bees in deciding which flowers to go to for foraging and was a relatively unknown area of science. TED.com: E.O. Wilson's advice to young scientists . It should be noted that we did not receive funding for this project largely because it was thought that children ""... could not do it,"" and because the funders required the process to be fully prescribed, which is like asking an artist to describe what the painting is going to look like before he/she paints it, or to describe the results of an experiment before even the question itself has been devised. The result was tremendous. Not only did the children devise meaningful questions, but also crafted games (i.e. experiments) to address them. They made the subsequent observations and working together created a ""story"" about the process and their observations. It was the latter that was submitted for publication. TED.com: Yep, I built a nuclear fusion reactor . Naturally, while the editors of nearly every biologically-based science journal -- including the most prestigious journals -- were interested in the story and process, none were willing to review the manuscript because it wasn't written in the typical style of a science paper. This, however, creates a problem. If one has observations that are both novel and relevant obtained from a robust scientific method, are the findings made less important by mode of communication? (The paper was eventually published by the journal Biology Letters; read it here.) The Blackawton Bees Project demonstrates that by participating in real science, we can all become observers of the intimately private process by which our brains make sense of the world. By becoming actively involved in the process of making sense, the children not only became the scientist -- and thus learned about science from within -- but the process fostered in each child a sense of choice, creativity and compassion. TED.com: Award-winning teenage science in action . These latter motivations are, I'd suggest, the true reasons for changing the way science is currently taught in our schools -- to ""See Myself See:"" to become actively aware of how our environment, perception and imagination shape who we are as an individual and as a society.

"(CNN) -- As the tech world watched the birth of the Apple Watch on Tuesday, another iconic device from the Cupertino company was being laid to rest. The iPod Classic, the (relatively) big and blocky version of Apple's music player that represented the straightest line back to its original form, was quietly removed from the company's lineup on Tuesday . Is the Apple Watch a game-changer? The signs had been there for a while. Apple hadn't updated the the Classic since 2009 and had quit mentioning it, even at iPod-specific events. But some loyalists still love it. Although it doesn't have the touchscreens of new models like the Touch and is downright huge in comparison with the sleek Nano and miniscule Shuffle, the Classic packed a whopping 160 GB of storage. That's enough to hold 40,000 songs, according to Apple. Hands-on with the new Apple Watch . On social media, users were reacting with real emotion, bidding farewell to a ""good buddy"" and ""old friend."" To some, it was perhaps a bit of nostalgia, losing the only remaining iPod that bears a resemblance to the original and other early models. For others, it was about the utility of the thing. Sure, it's bigger and bulkier. But it holds 40,000 songs! ""Farewell #iPodClassic,"" wrote London tech consultant Phillip Downer on Twitter. ""Replacing a device that does one thing supremely well with multiple gadgets doing multiple things quite well."" Take a look at our gallery above, which looks back at the Classic and other iPod models through the years.","Apple has discontinued the iPod Classic .

"Mumbai (CNN) -- Just a few weeks ago, a young boy tied to a bus stop in Mumbai barely received a glance from passersby oblivious to his plight. Deaf and mute, nine-year-old Lakhan was regularly tied to a pole by his elderly grandmother for fear he would run into traffic on a nearby road while she was away at work. Now, grandmother and grandson are living in a home for deaf and mute children, the patch of pavement where they both lived swapped for a roof above their heads. After reading about Lakhan on CNN in June, people wrote, tweeted, messaged, called and emailed from around the world. Many wrote to express their concern. Some wrote to ask how they could help. Others sent funds to help rehabilitate Lakhan. One person started a Facebook page to raise awareness about his plight. The response was overwhelming. ""I was under the impression -- 'who cares for such stories?'"" said Meena Mutha, a social worker with the Manav Foundation. She'd been trying to find Lakhan a more suitable home since placing him in a government-run shelter for juveniles in June. It was better than the street but not suitable for a boy with cerebral palsy who needed dedicated care. Mutha took on Lakhan's case in late May when a constable called her after seeing the boy's photo in a local newspaper. Lakhan was tied to a pole with rags and his elderly grandmother, Sakubai, was obviously struggling to take care of him as well as herself. ""He is deaf so he would not be able to hear traffic coming. If he ran onto the road, he'd get killed,"" Sakubai told CNN in June. ""See, it's a long rope,"" she said, holding out a piece of frayed cloth. There were many similar pieces of cloth tied to different poles. A life of struggle . Sakubai told CNN Lakhan's father had passed away four years ago. His mother deserted them and his older sister ran away. She had done the best she could, selling trinkets on a nearby beach to earn a meager wage to feed them. There was no money for shelter so she stretched out a piece of cloth on the ground behind the bus stop where they both would sleep. Mutha struggled to find Lakhan a suitable home. Mumbai only has one government-run center for children with special needs and there was no room left for him. Her exasperation turned to hope when a father and son team, Alok and Parth Polke, stepped in with an offer to take in Lakhan for free. They also offered his grandmother a job in their hostel, in Satara, a scenic hill town not far from Mumbai. ""Lakhan's a special case,"" said Alok Polke, who runs Samata Shikshan Prasarak Mandal (SSPM), a non-governmental organization that caters to deaf and mute children. ""His father died, his mother and sister abandoned him. He's left alone. What happens after his grandmother?"" Hostel offers new hope . CNN accompanied Lakhan, his grandmother and Mutha to Satara. He's the first mentally-challenged student to live in the SSPM hostel, which until now has only been for children who can't hear or speak. Polke said there were ""thousands of Lakhans in India"" who desperately need a roof over their heads. He said there are some homes for children who are deaf and dumb because they are comparatively easier to look after. However, children who are mentally-challenged need dedicated help: more staff, attention outside of school hours, funding, and infrastructure. ""That's lacking everywhere in India,"" Polke said. Lakhan appeared to settle in quickly into his new surroundings. Within an hour of reaching the hostel, he was running around in the yard, playing with the other children, each one a child of special needs, each one quickly engaged in a game of tag. They are some of the more fortunate ones. Lack of care in India . According to the last census conducted in 2011, around 26.8 million people are in living with disabilities in India. That's 2.2% of the population of more than 1.2 billion. Other bodies, including the World Bank, say the figure is much higher. Many of them are children whose needs aren't being met by government shelters. Even the government admits the lack of facilities for disabled children in India is a serious problem. ""There should be lots more institutions for these kinds of children,"" said Vijaya Murthy, a member of the government-run Child Welfare Committee in the state of Maharashtra. When asked why the state had not established more institutions, she said the responsibility did not lie with the government alone. ""Society and government should come forward and have some rehabilitation plans for special needs children,"" she said. She was unable to provide details of any specific plans the government has to rehabilitate thousands of other children like Lakhan in India, many of whom remain invisible and ignored.

"Kansas City, Kansas (CNN) -- Republican groups from all corners of the party are reluctantly starting to pour money into this traditionally red state to try to save the incumbent GOP senator -- and lock down their prospects of taking control of the Senate. The Kansas-based Koch brothers, who have so far engaged minimally here, are poised to step up their efforts to help Sen. Pat Roberts, according to sources familiar with their plans. Worried that Roberts could lose the GOP seat in their backyard, the Koch founded and funded group, Americans For Prosperity, plans to increase its activity in the last weeks of the campaign. Freedom Partners, another conservative group with ties to the Koch brothers, already spent nearly $1 million in television ads to help Roberts and plans another buy before election day. Other outside groups that hoped to spend campaign cash at this time to defeat incumbent Democrats are also now coming in big to defend this GOP seat. Until recently, Republicans thought they'd only have to play defense in Georgia and Kentucky, where Democrats have mounted competitive Senate campaigns. But Democratic candidate Chad Taylor's abrupt decision to drop out of the Kansas race last month transformed the election here into an unexpected head-to-head contest between Roberts and independent Greg Orman. Orman has said he will caucus with whatever party is in the majority, but Republicans don't want to take any chances. They saw a GOP Senate takeover within their reach in the last two elections, 2010 and 2012, only to be snatched away -- mostly by intra GOP fighting and candidate missteps. Ruby red Kansas has not elected a Democrat to the Senate in over 80 years, but Roberts is under attack for a cardinal sin in politics -- losing touch with the people back home. National Republicans came in to help overcome that image to win a tough primary fight, and he is now up against Orman -- a businessman who is successfully appealing to voters as outside Washington and outside the two party system. The Ending Spending Action Fund, founded by billionaire businessman Joe Ricketts, announced it is pouring more than $1 million dollars into Kansas for television and radio ads over the next several weeks, and is poised to spend more if needed. On Friday the group released one of those ads, first shared with CNN, which casts Orman as a liberal who's ""masquerading"" as an independent. Brian Baker, who runs the group, tells CNN they saw polling that showed Roberts in trouble, and worry that his opponent, independent Orman, is really an ""Democrat masquerading as an Independent."" Orman ran as a Democrat in the past, but has given money to and voted for candidates in both parties. ""We think its crazy to leave the Senate majority to someone who won't come clean to the people of Kansas about what he stands for,"" said Baker, referring to the fact that Orman is cagey about who he will caucus with if he wins, and if his decision determines which party controls the Senate. Baker was an aide to former Kansas Senator Bob Dole, a close friend of Roberts who is working behind the scenes as well as in public to pull Roberts over the finish line. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which played a major role helping incumbent Republicans in the GOP primary season, is also about to ""go big"" in Kansas for Roberts, according to a source familiar with their plans. In a preview earlier this week, Roberts appeared with the Kansas Chamber of Commerce to receive its endorsement. UPDATE: An initial version of this story didn't include the proper name for Ending Spending Action Fund and misquoted its president, Brian Baker.

"Washington (CNN) -- First lady Michelle Obama stepped into the fashion world on Wednesday by helping those pursuing fashion careers have face time with some high-profile fashion icons. More than 150 students attended the first White House Fashion Education Workshop with some of the nation's most famous designers and magazine editors, such as Anna Wintour of Vogue Magazine, Jason Wu, Diane von Furstenberg and Narciso Rodriguez. Obama, who hosted the workshops and luncheon, emphasized the importance of education in getting ahead. ""I know that many of you are hoping to one day pursue a career in fashion, and that's why we invited you here today, because we want you to really understand what it's going to take to be successful,"" Obama said. ""We want you to see firsthand that a solid education and the willingness to work hard is really at the core of what it's going to take to achieve your goals: education and hard work. It's that simple."" Von Furstenberg, who designed the famous wrap dress, echoed that message and told the participants how she made her dreams come true. ""When you are young, it's most important that first you study, that first moment of studying, that is what will stay with you forever,"" she said. ""But keep your eyes opened. And be open. Be open to everything. Be curious."" The first lady also talked about the example of an unlikely fashion icon: Sara Blakely. Blakely worked her way up from selling fax machines for an office supply company and working as a ride operator at Disney World, all while developing and devoting her savings to a new business idea. ""She pitched her idea to factories and mills, asking them to help her make the product a reality, and of course, she was turned down again and again and again,"" Obama recounted. ""But finally, a manager at a factory liked her idea, and today, 14 years later, Sara's idea, Spanx, is a multibillion-dollar company with products selling in more than 50 countries. And we all wear them with pride!"" The students represented more than a dozen schools from the East Coast and participated in five workshops, where they heard from dozens of experts on the topics of construction in fashion, entrepreneurship, and fashion journalism. They also heard from a panel that included several top designers like von Furstenberg, Jenna Lyons of J. Crew, and Wu, all whose creations have been worn by Obama. Wu, who designed the first lady's dresses for both her husband's inaugurations, told the audience about growing up in Taiwan and feeling like he was different when he chose designing clothes over playing sports. Obama assured the fashionistas that hard work and perseverance are essential to succeed. ""I want those stories to show you that there's no magic to being successful in fashion or in anything else. What is required is a willingness to work long nights, to suffer through rejection and failure, to rise above all of that, all the doubts and fears and anxieties, whether you come from, you know, the city, the suburbs, no matter where you come from, all those feelings are natural,"" Obama said.","First Lady Michelle Obama hosts a fashion workshop at the White House .

"(CNN) -- Another day, another mass shooting in America. More blood, more tears, more knee-jerk rhetoric about finding a solution for a bunch of different problems. Those who knew Aaron Alexis -- the shooter who killed 12 and injured eight more at the Washington Navy Yard this week -- said he was a quiet, shy man. At one point he was studying Buddhism and meditated often. A little more digging, and we find he had several gun-related arrests and a pattern of misconduct in the Navy, but he was honorably discharged. Pieces of a puzzle we may never fully put together. But the fact that there is still so much we don't know about Alexis -- or the motive behind the shootings -- won't detour gun-control advocates from lumping his story in with that of Adam Lanza, the man police say is responsible for the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, along with the victims from gang- and drug-related shootings. This is why after the tears have dried and the blood washes away, little, if anything, will change. And because gun-control advocates so often try to cobble together every distinct narrative involving guns into a one-size-fits-all conversation, they are as much to blame for this merry-go-round as the gun lobbyists against whom they fight. Gun shops are illegal in Chicago. Opinion: What could have prevented carnage? The city has bans on both assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. And yet each week people continue to die in the streets from gunshot wounds. This conundrum is just one example why making note that more Americans have died from gun violence here at home since Newtown than in the nine years fighting a war in Iraq is the kind of factoid that grabs our attention but undermines the true goal: curtailing the violence. Not all deaths involving guns are the same -- therefore trying to address each incident from the same point of view is futile. Until we learn more about Alexis -- the events leading up to the shootings and the motive -- the tragedy in Washington should not be used as catalyst for a conversation about gun control. Instead, we should mourn and wait for more information. Far too often assumptions surrounding the details of tragedies such as the one in Washington are made, and well-intentioned stances fall apart when additional facts come to light. The guns James Holmes was charged with using in Aurora were purchased legally. Beyond the presence of a gun, the crimes committed in the movie theater are not at all similar to what happens in the streets of our large cities. And each time a politician or gun-control advocate tries to use these two very different examples interchangeably, the entire conversation and argument are compromised. This happened after Newtown. It happened after Aurora. And it will keep continue to happen until the advocates accept that ridding the country of guns is a hopeless -- and unconstitutional mission -- and that the real goal should be addressing the factors that lead to the various forms of gun violence: factors such as poverty, mental health and failing schools. Last month the nation breathed a sigh of relief after Antoinette Tuff, a bookkeeper in an elementary school in suburban Atlanta, prevented a man with an AK-47-type weapon and nearly 500 rounds of ammunition from hurting anyone. It was not the time to talk generally about gun violence in this country. It was the time to discuss specifics such as cuts to mental health and its impact on services, given that the suspect, 20-year-old Michael Brandon Hill, has a long history of mental disorders. Hill's storyline is similar to that of Lanza, and there are questions whether Holmes, the admitted shooter in the Aurora movie theater, is insane. Public debates with Wayne LaPierre and attacks on the National Rifle Association have proven to be an ineffective way to prevent gun violence. In the wake of the Washington Navy Yard killings, perhaps a new strategy, one that doesn't involve playing on the nation's emotions or challenging the relevance of the Second Amendment, should be employed. That's not saying the NRA has won -- in fact, I think LaPierre should step down because each time he opens his mouth, he steps in it -- but at the end of the day the organization is more of an agitator than the enemy. There is no one enemy. Thus there is no one solution. Because like it or not, the folks spraying our cities with bullets are not NRA members or legal gun owners. And despite the tendency to tie it all together, they have nothing to do with the Adam Lanzas of the world. And it's too early to know how Alexis fits in the conversation. According to a count by USA Today, more than 900 people have been killed in mass shootings since 2006. The thousands of other victims of gun violence over the past seven years died from many different circumstances, requiring different conversations. This is why gun-control advocates need to abandon the routine of using mass shootings to turn law-abiding citizens into social pariahs and instead focus on something that could work. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","LZ Granderson: We're hearing more knee-jerk rhetoric about gun-control measures .
He says there's not enough information about Navy Yard shootings to figure out solutions .
More gun-control measures are unrealistic and won't prevent the carnage, he says .

"Washington (CNN) -- Louisiana Democrat Sen. Mary Landrieu is in the middle of a storm. She is beset by well-funded forces on the right who sense the Gulf Coast Democrat's vulnerability in trying to defend a Senate seat in a red state. On the left, she is trying to avoid being pulled down by the undertow of a president whose decline in approval ratings and controversial health care reform law might not play well with her state's conservative sensibilities. She's been buffeted by rough re-election fights before, and in previous successful bids for the state legislature, state treasurer's office and eventually two runoffs for the U.S. Senate seat she's proven she has the thick skin and political acumen to weather storms. For example, her 1996 Senate win included a nail-biter of a runoff that she won by just 5,788 votes amid allegations of voter fraud by her challenger, state Rep. Woody Jenkins, and a congressional probe before she could finally assume office. She also has the political pedigree as the sister of New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu and daughter of former New Orleans mayor and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Maurice ""Moon"" Landrieu. ""We have been in this business for a long time; you try to insulate yourself a little bit from some of the negative aspects,"" Moon Landrieu told the New York Times in January. But this time there's a lot more at stake. 2014 midterms: What's at stake . ""Historically, her re-elections have been very tough,"" said Silas Lee, a social politics professor at Xavier University in Louisiana. ""This time, to some degree, it's a nationalized re-election. She didn't have to contend with the outside interests trying to defeat her before."" Landrieu hails from a state where, despite the fact that just over 48% of the electorate are registered Democrats, voters have for the past two presidential cycles cast ballots for Republican nominees. Of the eight members of Louisiana's congressional delegation, Landrieu and Rep. Cedric Richmond, who represents part of New Orleans, are the only two Democrats. During her 2008 re-election bid she managed to narrowly clear by two points the state's 50% threshold for electoral victory. And that was in a good year for Democrats with the winds of a history-making victory in electing the nation's first African-American president at their back. President Barack Obama won big with minorities, women and young voters, and Democrats were able to capitalize on that energized, high turnout in down-ballot races. In fact, that year's election was the only one in which Landrieu did not face a runoff for the Senate seat. There are no such winds this year. It's a midterm election year, and the electoral mood and climate have changed dramatically. 2014 Midterm Elections . Once-popular President Barack Obama now has an approval rating of 42%. His popularity soured somewhat following controversies over his administration's intelligence gathering techniques, congressional inquiries into IRS targeting of conservative political groups and the botched rollout of the Affordable Care Act, the president's signature health care reform law. Republicans have vowed to hang Obamacare like a proverbial albatross around the necks of vulnerable Democrats like Landrieu. For example, the conservative super-PAC Americans for Prosperity, funded by the Koch brothers, a pair of wealthy industrialists, has spent more than $3 million on ads in Louisiana highlighting Landrieu's 2010 vote for Obamacare. She faces a strong GOP challenge from U.S. Rep. Bill Cassidy, a doctor who has earned lauds for his charity work, and who in many ways symbolizes exactly what Landrieu is up against as one of only two Democrats in her state's congressional delegation. The challenge from tea party-backed retired Air Force Col. Rob Maness further complicates matters in that grassroots conservatives are rallying to his side, expanding the field of those taking shots at the incumbent. ""God help us if this goes to a runoff and helps us determine the fate of the Senate,"" said Jennifer Duffy, senior editor with the Cook Political Report. Louisiana's election law calls for Election Day in the rest of the country to be an open primary for all comers. If no candidate gets more than 50% of the vote, a runoff is scheduled in December. These races will determine control of the Senate . Meanwhile, in the Senate, her party is clawing to keep its 53-45 majority. Democrats are fighting to keep 21 of the 36 Senate seats up for grabs in November. Half of those are Democratic-held seats in red or purple states. ""In order for her to get this far she had to have had people who vote Republican at the presidential level,"" said Nathan Gonzales, deputy editor of the Rothenberg Political Report. ""But Louisiana is difficult when we're talking Democrats and Republicans...you have people who are Democrat by heritage but vote Republican."" As a result, Landrieu has found herself in the precarious position of trying to keep her Senate seat in a state that trends red all the while supporting the leader of her party in a way that makes clear to the people in Louisiana that they are her priority. In her recent campaign ad, a clip shows Landrieu stating emphatically ""the administration's policies are simply wrong when it comes to oil and gas production in this nation."" ""For years she's forced Washington to respect Louisiana,"" says the commercial's narrator. The ad goes on to tout her efforts to end the federal government's ban on offshore oil and gas drilling that was enacted after the 2010 BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. The ad also highlights her victory in requiring the federal government to split offshore royalties with Louisiana and other oil and gas producing states. Plus, as the ad reminds viewers, ""now as the new chairman of the Energy Committee, she holds the most powerful position in the Senate for Louisiana."" It's also an ad that Republicans criticized for the Senator's use of staged, recreated news clips from a committee hearing. Landrieu's campaign pointed to congressional rules that ban lawmakers from using ""radio or television coverage of the proceedings of the Senate for political campaign purposes."" Landrieu touts fight for oil and gas jobs in new ad . Still, Landrieu has stepped cautiously in her connection to Obama. When the President visited her state in November, Landrieu traveled with him, but then she was conspicuously absent from a speech he gave at the Port of New Orleans. Instead, she made the rounds of other events in the state. ""She has to convince voters that she is not a typical national Democrat,"" Gonzales said. ""She has to show some distance from the President, and Democrats have to make congressman Cassidy an unacceptable alternative."" Key races to watch in 2014 . CNN's Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.","A changed political climate, influence of outside money complicates re-election bid .

"(CNN) -- World football's governing body FIFA suspended two of its executive committee members amid allegations of World Cup bid corruption on Thursday. The organization's ethics committee -- who held a press conference from their headquarters' building in Zurich, Switzerland -- confirmed that Amos Adamu of Nigeria and Reynald Temarii of Tahiti would not be allowed to take part in the December ballot to decide the host of the 2018 and 2022 World Cup following an investigation. Adamu, 57, who has been a FIFA member since 2006 and is the director of sports development in his homeland, was provisionally suspended for three years as well as being fined $10, 000. Temarii, 43, a FIFA vice president who is president of the Oceania Football Confederation and adviser to the French Polynesian government, was given a 12-month provisional ban as well as a fine of $5,000. The move follows allegations in the British newspaper the Sunday Times, that both executives had solicited bribes in exchange for their support of a candidate bid. Bribery scandal shows that FIFA must change . In an undercover operation, the newspaper's reporters said they approached six current or former FIFA officials, all of whom ""suggested paying huge bribes to FIFA executive committee members."" Two of the six asked for direct payment themselves, the paper reported. FIFA ethics committee chairman Claudio Sulser said: ""We will have a zero tolerance policy for all violations of the standards. We are in favor of a healthy football, football as something positive in our lives. We don't want cheaters, we don't want doping, and we don't want any type of abuses to be accepted in terms of respecting the rules. We don't want any type of illicit advantages to take place."" The ballot will now go ahead as scheduled on 2 December, without Adamu and Temarii taking part, meaning that 22 voters will now decide between the nine candidate nations. Timeline of World Cup bidding scandal . There are four candidates, all in Europe, to host the 2018 tournament: England, Russia and a pair of dual bids, one from Spain and Portugal, the other from Belgium and the Netherlands. The United States, Australia, Japan, South Korea and Qatar all hope to be home to the 2022 tournament. Four other FIFA officials were disciplined by the committee: Slim Aloulou, the chairman of the FIFA Dispute Resolution Chamber, was banned for two years while Ahongalu Fusimalohi -- the general secretary of the Tonga Football Association -- and Amadou Diakite -- member of the Referees Committee -- were both given a three-year ban. FIFA finds shortcomings in World Cup bids ahead of vote . Ismael Bhamjee of Botswana -- a honorary member from the Confederation of African Football (CAF) -- was suspended from taking part in football-related activity for four years. FIFA stated that each member had breached various articles of their code of ethics but stopped short of claiming that any had been found guilty of corruption. Sulser admitted that the findings had been ""greatly"" damaging for the Swiss-based organization. ""The damage caused to FIFA as regards its image is very great. It is also good to establish why it's important to tell the truth in newspapers. When one talks of FIFA there is generally a negative attitude out there. ""There is talk of corruption. This is rather peculiar its rather curious but on the other hand its not joke because FIFA is a big organization with many interests and where there are many interests certain things can go array the difference now is the following -- now we are trying to work in complete transparency,"" Sulser added. Adamu told the Press Association that, despite the findings of the investigation, he intended to appeal the decision. FIFA must challenge any potential corruption cancer . ""I am profoundly disappointed with the ethics committee's findings and had honestly believed I would be exonerated of any charges by now,"" he said. ""I am innocent of all the charges leveled against me by the ethics committee and I completely refute the decision they have made. As yet I have not been advised of the grounds of the ethics committee's decision but regardless, I will be lodging a full appeal against it with immediate effect."" The body added that no evidence of violation between bid committees, in relation to the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bidding process, had been found. Allegations of collusion between the bid teams of Spain-Portugal 2018 and Qatar 2022, an action that is against bidding regulations, had surfaced prior to Thursday's announcement but FIFA found in their favor.","World football's governing body FIFA suspends two of its officials .

"(CNN) -- Superheroes are proving their powers at the box office. ""The Avengers,"" a superhero smorgasbord featuring Captain America, Iron Man, Thor and The Hulk, is expected to top $1 billion worldwide on Sunday, its 19th day of release, said Walt Disney Studios. The film, which had the highest domestic box office debut, brought in an estimated $103.2 million in domestic theaters its second weekend, setting another industry record, according to Disney. It raked in $207.4 million opening weekend. ""We're obviously thrilled with the global success of 'The Avengers,'"" Robert A. Iger, Disney's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. ""It's a fantastic movie and an extraordinary franchise that will continue with more great stories and compelling characters for years to come."" To date, ""The Avengers"" has earned some $628.9 million internationally, said Disney. The company is planning a sequel to the smash film. Its success is another boon for the movie industry, which racked up about $2.3 billion at the U.S. box office for the first three months of 2012 -- up almost 46% from a year earlier, according to Box Office Mojo. Still, in some ways Hollywood had nowhere to go but up after posting its worst year for ticket sales in 2011 in 16 years. Before ""The Avengers"" burst on the scene, ""The Hunger Games"" from Lionsgate had been this year's box-office champ, taking in an estimated $155 million domestically in its first weekend. Other might-be blockbusters on the horizon include ""Men in Black III"" hitting theaters Memorial Day weekend, and ""Brave,"" the latest animated feature from Pixar due in June. And two other comic-inspired vehicles, ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" and ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" are also on the summer movie calendar. The success of ""The Avengers"" comes on the heels of Disney's epic flop ""John Carter,"" which lost an estimated $200 million and cost the head of the company's studio unit his job.

"Shanghai (CNN) -- Hong Kong's pro-democracy demonstrations have been front-page fodder this past week in international media, which have painted the story as a David-and-Goliath struggle between local Hong Kongers and a powerful but distant authoritarian master in Beijing. But no such headlines have appeared in China, where the story has been buried deep inside most newspapers and TV broadcasts, and is framed in a way that makes it uninteresting and unintelligible to average Chinese. The coverage consists mostly of Beijing's reactions to events with little or no explanation of what actually happened to prompt such response. The result is a hodgepodge of reports condemning the protests, saying that Hong Kong leader C.Y. Leung will never resign, and editorials declaring such protests will never spread to China. It has also been noteworthy for the relative lack of images. From a media perspective, the demonstrations now taking place are a journalist's dream come true, featuring colorful and action-filled images of protesters, police, politicians and conflict that make for great TV viewing and photos . Yet none of those images have found their way into China's official media, almost certainly on direct orders from propaganda officials who worry such pictures could inspire others in China to take similar action. Strict bans on such inflammatory images are quite common in order-obsessed China, even when such protests are pro-Chinese. One such ban was a central feature in domestic coverage of a major territorial dispute with Japan two years ago, with major protests that broke out around China eerily absent from all domestic reports. Old trick . China's media have also resorted to another old trick of covering the conflict using editorials, which offer a backdoor route into the story with little or no broader context. In this case the official Communist Party newspaper People's Daily has taken the lead with a series of forceful editorials repeating that such protests are illegal and adding that such actions will never spread to China. Such editorializing has been a popular tool for stating official views on sensitive subjects since 1949, and was widely used in 2010 when Google got into a high-profile dispute over Beijing's stipulations that it self-censor its China-based search site. That conflict ultimately saw Google withdrawal from the China search market, only to be cast by Chinese media as a cry baby that couldn't compete with local rivals. Beijing has also dusted off its tried-and-true tactic of using key ""buzzwords"" to control the tone of the story. Two such buzzwords this time have been ""illegal,"" to describe the nature of the Hong Kong demonstrations, and ""in accordance with the law,"" to describe how the China-friendly Leung administration is handling the situation. Finally there's the social media element, which is a new game not only for China but governments throughout the world as they try to harness this powerful force to influence public opinion. Social media . In this case, a number of commentaries have been making the rounds on popular social media platforms like WeChat, playing on themes that criticize the protesters for everything from threatening Hong Kong's prosperity to harboring broader hostility toward all mainland Chinese. These stories by little-known writers could be genuine, but are most likely a variation on another Beijing tactic to control online public opinion in the Internet age. Known by the disparaging moniker of the ""Fifty-Cent Party,"" this loosely defined group's ""members"" reportedly receive government payment for posing as independent commentators who seed the Internet with opinions favorable to the central government's policies and views. The latest protests in Hong Kong may be providing new challenges for Beijing's leadership from a new generation of democracy-seeking activists on China's periphery. But the tactics being used by China's media are anything but new, with Beijing resorting to a wide range of time-tested reporting tricks in its bid to shape the issue in the realm of domestic public opinion.","Hong Kong's pro-democracy protests have been front-page news except in China .
Coverage has been limited, with focus on editorials that lack broader context .
Few images of the protests have been shown on Chinese media .
Authorities fear pictures could inspire others in China to take similar actions ."
"New York (CNN) -- Within hours of speaking with the BBC and Voice of America, both in Persian, Fariborz Raisdana, a leading Iranian economist, was arrested by the security forces of the Islamic Republic. On both these occasions, Raisdana was severely critical of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's program of substantially cutting governmental subsidies, in what amounts to ""the biggest surgery"" to the Iranian economy in 50 years. Initiated on Sunday, the government's actions introduced a four-fold rise in the price of gasoline and seriously cut government food subsidies, including, literally, people's daily bread. The current 20% inflation rate, some economies believe, will in fact increase after these new ""austerity measures."" Even economists sympathetic to Ahmadinejad's policies warn of higher inflation and characterize his claim of ""zero inflation"" as disingenuous. A much milder version of a hike in the gasoline price resulted in widespread riots and the burning down of gas stations by protesters back in 2007, only two years into Ahmadinejad's presidency. This time around Ahmadinejad anticipated possible protests by ""flooding Iran's capital"" with the militarized security forces, in a move similar to the government's response to the opposition Green Movement. The U.S.-led and U.N.-imposed sanctions against Iran, aimed at stopping its nuclear program and supported by those wishing for ""regime change,"" obviously played a major role in increasing the pressure for cutting government spending. But among Raisdana's comments to BBC and VOA was the fact that such cuts in governmental subsidies and a turn to neoliberal economics was a policy favored by the last two presidents of Iran, who have also been (to varied degrees) supporters of the Green Movement -- Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and Mohammad Khatami. This creates a major rift within the opposition camp of the Green Movement. Its leadership, particularly Khatami, now needs to decide where they stand -- they can no longer oppose Ahmadinejad for a program they were championing for decades -- but did not have the political will and/or military wherewithal to implement. By taking these steps and introducing a form of Reaganomics to Iran, Ahmadinejad is exposing his own hypocrisy. He can no longer pose as the populist champion of the poor fighting against the presumably more affluent members of the Green Movement. He has also exposed as a fraud his global posturing as an anti-capitalist champion. Some 7 million Iranian laborers, and their families -- with their union leaders like Mansur Osanlou suffering in the dungeons of the Islamic Republic -- are set to suffer the consequences of these cuts in subsidies. Ahmadinejad's neoliberal economics share another thing with President Ronald Reagan's policies. The Iranian president is pushing an increase in military spending. That buildup is first and foremost prompted by the military threat that the U.S. and its regional allies have posed to the Islamic Republic for at least the last decade. Such spending also supports the heavily militarized security apparatus of Ahmadinejad's regime. It helps employ less-well-off Iranians, making them beholden to the regime and enhances the power of the ""the military industrial complex"" that now rules the country from the headquarters of its paramilitary revolutionary guards. Be that as it may, these same measures also expose the banality of Ahmadinejad's alliance with such self-proclaimed champions of anti-capitalism as Evo Morales of Bolivia and Hugo Chavez of Venezuela. And it makes a mockery of what passes for ""progressive anti-war activists"" in the United States who fall head over toe trying to have dinner with Ahmadinejad when he visits New York, in support of his ""anti-capitalist,"" and ""anti-imperialist"" positions. Domestically, the move is a calculated risk for Ahmadinejad, because it will undoubtedly compromise his populist propaganda, if not his claim to a popular base. Still it may be a risk worth taking for Ahmadinejad, since it could weaken the opposition. If this opposition wants a market-driven economy, here it is -- initiated by Ahmadinejad's government. The ball is now squarely in Mir Hossein Mousavi's court. The leader of the Green Movement must clearly and succinctly distinguish his economic philosophy from that of Ahmadinejad and his predecessors, and reach out on behalf of the most vulnerable social classes of the society as they struggle with huge cost increases. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Hamid Dabashi.","Iran cut government food and fuel subsidies, leading to higher prices .

"(CNN) -- Former New England Patriot Aaron Hernandez is behind bars, accused of murdering three people. Long before he made national headlines, he was a standout athlete in Bristol, Connecticut, who came from a family described as a local sports dynasty. Hernandez left high school halfway through his senior year in January 2007 to join the University of Florida Gators. He entered the NFL draft after his junior year and was selected by the Patriots in the fourth round. By the end of the second season, he inked a five-year contract extension worth $40 million. But less than a year later, he was charged with first-degree murder in the death of Odin Lloyd. Two hours after his arrest on June 26, 2013, the Patriots dropped him from the team. Hernandez has also been charged in the slayings of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado, and some of his closest associates are facing serious charges in connection with the alleged crimes. Hernandez has pleaded not guilty and is expected to go on trial next year. Here is a primer on some of the names you might be hearing about ahead of his trials: . Inside the case against Aaron Hernandez . Odin Lloyd . Odin Lloyd was a 27-year-old semi-pro football player. He was found dead on June 17, 2013, less than a mile from Hernandez's home in North Attleboro, Massachusetts. He had been shot seven times. Lloyd met Hernandez while dating Shaneah Jenkins, the sister of Hernandez's fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins. Hernandez is charged with orchestrating Lloyd's execution. Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado . Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado were killed outside a Boston nightclub on July 16, 2012. Prosecutors say de Abreu accidentally bumped into Hernandez, spilling a drink. Later that night, Hernandez was driving an SUV and allegedly pulled up alongside de Abreu and Furtado's car near the nightclub and fired a .38-caliber revolver at them. Alexander Bradley . Alexander Bradley is a former friend of Hernandez who was allegedly with Hernandez on the night de Abreu and Furtado were killed. He is not facing any charges in that case, but he is jailed on unrelated charges. He is suing Hernandez for allegedly shooting him in the face in February 2013. Bradley claims Hernandez accused him of ""disrespecting him"" over a cell phone left in a Miami strip club. Carlos Ortiz . Carlos Ortiz, nicknamed Charlie Boy, is also charged with murder in the death Odin Lloyd and has pleaded not guilty. A law enforcement source said he cooperated with police and described the night of Lloyd's death. Ernest Wallace . Ernest Wallace, nicknamed Hobo, is also charged with murder in the death of Odin Lloyd. He has pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors call him the ""muscle man"" for Hernandez. They say he was in the car with Hernandez, Lloyd and Carlos Ortiz an hour before the car is seen on video heading to the industrial park where Lloyd was killed. Shayanna Jenkins . Shayanna Jenkins is Hernandez's fiancee and the mother of his daughter. She is charged with perjury, allegedly lying to a grand jury about guns in their home. She has pleaded not guilty. Her sister, Shaneah, was dating Odin Lloyd at the time of his death. Shaneah Jenkins . Shaneah Jenkins is the girlfriend of Odin Lloyd. Her sister is Hernandez's fiancÃ©e. In court, the two sisters sit on opposite sides, Shayanna with the defense and Shaneah with the prosecution. Tanya Cummings-Singleton . Tanya Cummings-Singleton is a cousin of Hernandez. In her garage, police found the SUV allegedly driven by Hernandez and linked to the 2012 Boston double homicide. She was twice charged with contempt of court for refusing to testify before two grand juries despite immunity offers. She has pleaded guilty to obstruction in the Lloyd case. She is also suffering from cancer. Thaddeus Singleton . Thaddeus Singleton, husband of Tanya Cummings-Singleton, was killed in a car accident after Lloyd's slaying. Police say his speeding car went airborne and crashed. A source says police planned to interview him about his relationship with Hernandez. Shaquilla Thibou . Shaquilla Thibou is the sister of Odin Lloyd. Prosecutors say she saw her brother get into a car with Hernandez, Wallace and Ortiz before he was killed. Prosecutors say she received a text from her brother that night telling her he was with ""Nfl,"" adding, ""just so u know."" Terri Hernandez . Terri Hernandez is Aaron Hernandez's mother. She is a school secretary. Dennis Hernandez . Dennis Hernandez was Aaron Hernandez's father. He had a close relationship with his sons and was deeply involved in their sports training. He died unexpectedly after hernia surgery when Hernandez was 16. DJ Hernandez . DJ Hernandez is Aaron Hernandez's older brother. He was a star high school athlete. He also was a standout athlete at the University of Connecticut and now is an assistant coach at the University of Iowa. Andrew Booker . Andrew Booker shared a jail unit with Aaron Hernandez. The two allegedly got into a jail fight, and Hernandez was indicted in Booker's assault. The prosecution . District Attorney Samuel Sutter is leading the prosecution against Hernandez, along with William McCauley and Patrick Bomberg. ""Probably my career ... will be defined more by this case than all of the other things we've done,"" Sutter told CNN. The defense . Attorneys James Sultan, Michael Fee and Charles Rankin are handling Hernandez's defense. Rankin says ""not one shred of evidence has been presented yet."" He said he is confident Hernandez will be exonerated.","Aaron Hernandez expected to go on trial in 2015 .
He has pleaded not guilty to three first-degree murder charges .
Some of his closest associates are also facing charges ."
"(CNN) -- Iraqis in Diyala province sarcastically call it ""the whale."" A new report says a half-built prison in Khan Bani Saad, Iraq, will probably never be used. The ""skeletal, half-built"" shell of a maximum-security prison in Khan Bani Saad ""will probably never house an inmate"" even though the United States spent $40 million on the now-halted $73 million project. Marred by ""poor security and weak subcontractor performance,"" the project is among several examples of Iraqi rebuilding problems cited in a just-published history by the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction. Titled ""Hard Lessons: The Iraq Reconstruction Experience,"" the report says the massive reconstruction initiative was marked by waste and failures caused by ""blinkered and disjointed"" pre-war planning -- and was pursued amid deteriorating security. ""Why was an extensive rebuilding plan carried out in a gravely unstable security environment? asked Stuart W. Bowen Jr., the special inspector general for Iraq reconstruction, whose oversight jurisdiction covers $50 billion in U.S. funds appropriated by Congress for Iraq. ""This question underscores an overarching hard lesson from Iraq: Beware of pursuing large-scale reconstruction programs while significant conflict continues."" The report, released Monday, comes at a much less violent stage of the Iraqi conflict. The peaceful provincial elections across the nation Saturday reflected strides in political reconciliation and improvements in the performance of Iraqi security forces. But American commanders continually warn that the security gains are fragile and could be undermined by insurgents. The report says the U.S. government ""had neither the established structure nor the necessary resources to carry out the reconstruction mission it took on in mid-2003."" It weaves interviews, facts and vignettes detailing the use of a ""sea of taxpayer dollars"" from mid-2002 through autumn 2008. ""Hard Lessons"" also looks to the future. It stresses the importance of developing ""an agreed-upon doctrine and structure"" for reconstruction ""so that the United States is ready when it next must intervene in a failed or failing state."" The first of several principles mentioned for such operations: ""Security is necessary for large-scale reconstruction to succeed."" After U.S. forces toppled the Saddam Hussein regime in 2003, it was ""unprepared and ill-equipped to deal with what came next: a 'post-conflict' environment torn by violence, looters, criminals, a nascent insurgency; a governmental system in a state of complete collapse; and an economy that had slipped into idle and then switched off."" The raging Iraqi insurgency, crime and sectarian fighting ""informed and complicated every decision"" in funding such tasks as infrastructure building, security force development, job creation, economic reform and governance. ""The U.S. reconstruction management structure was overwhelmed by the challenges of building in a war zone,"" the report said. The program was marked by frequent changes in reconstruction strategy, ""turbulence"" caused by personnel turnover and ""poor integration"" of work by various U.S. government agencies. This was the result of ""weak unity of command and inconsistent unity of effort."" A lack of ""interagency debate"" took its toll when the U.S.-led Coalition Provincial Authority administered Iraq from May 2003 to June 2004. The report cites the agency's ""momentous orders"" of disbanding Iraq's military and removing members of Saddam's ruling Baath party from top government positions, a process called de-Baathification. ""Had these issues been fully discussed by the war Cabinet and within the CPA, the United States might have acted differently. Instead, the U.S. rebuilding program was left to deal with the instant loss of many of the Iraqi technocrats it would later need. ""It also had to build entirely new Iraqi security forces, a task that would ultimately consume more than half of all U.S.-appropriated reconstruction dollars,"" the report said. Through ""trial and error,"" the reconstruction program matured under successive U.S. ambassadors to Iraq John Negroponte, Zalmay Khalilzad and Ryan Crocker, and the U.S.-led ""surge"" and its ""complementary civilian effort"" led to a ""new era"" -- security strides and ""a more secure reconstruction environment."" And reconstruction became ""more Iraqi-driven and Iraqi-funded"" than it had been in 2003. Although there has been progress, ""the United States still struggled in late 2008 to make Iraq's reconstruction a success."" The program generally met its goals in developing the Iraqi security forces, but did not do so ""on the infrastructure front,"" the report concluded. Electricity and oil output are lower than the goals set five years ago by the CPA. ""Successful project completions in the key water and health sectors fell far short of hopes,"" the report said. There were ""egregious examples of fraud,"" but the amounts represented a small percentage of the overall reconstruction efforts, and the number of those ""involved was relatively low."" However, the waste ""grossly overburdened"" the program. ""The overuse of cost-plus contracts, high contractor overhead expenses, excessive contractor award fees, and unacceptable program and project delays all contributed to a significant waste of taxpayers' dollars,"" the report said. The report gives examples of waste, including the Khan Bani Saad prison project, which it describes as ""perhaps the single greatest project failure in the U.S. reconstruction program."" Bowen, who has been special inspector general for Iraq reconstruction since October 2004, previously served as the CPA's inspector general. He has had a longtime association with former President George W. Bush, serving in several capacities under his presidency, the Bush-Cheney transition team and Texas governorship.","New report cites failures in massive Iraq reconstruction initiative .

"(CNN)  -- Iran's supreme leader said Friday the Islamic republic isn't seeking and doesn't believe in pursuing nuclear bombs. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei made the remarks a day after a draft report from the U.N. nuclear watchdog said Iran may be working secretly to develop a nuclear warhead for a missile. ""Iran will not get emotional in its response to these nonsensical statements, because we have often said that our religious tenets and beliefs consider these kinds of weapons of mass destruction to be symbols of genocide and are, therefore, forbidden and considered to be haram (religiously banned),"" he said. ""This is why we do not believe in atomic bombs and weapons and do not seek them."" The ayatollah's remarks reflect the tensions between the West and Iran over its nuclear program. The United States and its allies fear that Iran aims to develop the capacity to build a nuclear bomb. Iran denies this, saying its nuclear program is designed solely to produce civilian energy and for medical use. The document is the first draft report by the International Atomic Energy Agency director general, Yukiya Amano, who replaced Mohamed ElBaradei late last year. It has not been approved by its board of governors, but the agency has expressed concerns over the years about Iran's nuclear activities. The draft report lists  ways in which the Islamic state is allegedly defying U.N. orders about its nuclear program. It said Iran had begun enriching uranium to a level that can sustain a nuclear reaction before IAEA inspectors arrived to monitor the process, and in defiance of a request not to do so. In Washington, Assistant Secretary of State P.J. Crowley said on Thursday the draft report is the first produced by the IAEA since the recent discovery of a secret nuclear facility at Qom. ""There is no explanation for that facility that is consistent with the needs of a civilian nuclear program,"" he said. ""And it characterizes the way in which Iran has conducted its... relations with the IAEA and its failure to satisfactorily explain, you know, what its activities and ambitions are in the nuclear sphere."" Crowley called the conclusions of the draft report ""consistent"" with arguments Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made this week in the Middle East. ""We have ongoing concerns about Iran's activities,"" Crowley told reporters. ""We cannot explain why it refuses to come to the table and engage constructively to answer the questions that have been raised, and you have to draw some conclusions from that."" The draft report highlighted concerns about rising tensions in the Middle East, particularly between Iran and Israel. Israel has often been the object of rhetoric by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who has said the Jewish state ""must be wiped off the map"" politically. The United States has assured Israel that its interests will be protected. Former IAEA weapons inspector David Albright told CNN Thursday that Iran's behavior ""has to make you worry more about a [potential] conflict."" Iran appears to be ""pushing"" for concessions from Western powers, he said. ""They're pushing on things that make them look like they're going for nuclear weapons, and that's risky. If they go much further, they may bring an attack on themselves by Israel. Iran needs to be a little more careful about its actions."" Michael Levi, a nuclear proliferation analyst at the Council on Foreign Relations, told CNN that, ""in a sense, we should be pleased by this. ...Having such a clear statement from an international body can only help develop a robust international response."" On Tuesday, Ahmadinejad warned the United States and other nations not to impose tougher sanctions in reaction to Iran's nuclear ambitions. He said recently that Iran will boost uranium enrichment to 20 percent. ""It's high time for some people to open their eyes and adapt themselves to real changes that are under way,"" he told reporters in Tehran. The draft report became public on the same day that U.S. Vice President Joe Biden gave a speech in Washington warning about the dangers of nuclear proliferation. ""The spread of nuclear weapons is the greatest threat facing the country -- and I would argue facing humanity -- and that is why we are working both to stop their proliferation and eventually to eliminate them,"" Biden said in remarks at National Defense University.","Iran's Supreme leader says ""why we do not believe in atomic bombs and weapons and do not seek them""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Satirical TV anchorman Stephen Colbert may not have a dog in this fight, but his name alone may have helped a Pomeranian-Chihuahua mix puppy beat a 6-year-old Cavalier King Charles spaniel. Stephen Colbert el dos rips the prize away from Mozart in the weekly competition. In the online doggie beauty pageant, the canine Steven Colbert el dos won the latest weekly semifinal, which enables him to compete for a $1 million grand prize. Colbert el dos from Georgia beat Mozart, or MoMo as he's known to his family and friends in New Orleans, Louisiana, to win cutest dog of the week. ""While it certainly would have been a lot of fun for MoMo to win this past week, we're excited for Stephen Colbert el dos and his owners. What a fun and entertaining ride it's been so far."" said  piano teacher Cara McCool, MoMo's owner. ""We're just happy for the attention this has brought to our charities as well as others supported by so many cute dogs in this competition,"" McCool said. Her charities included:  Redeemer Presbyterian Disaster Relief, Desire Street Ministries, Louisiana Teachers Save Our Students fund, Cavalier Rescue USA, Musical Arts Society of New Orleans, the Louisiana SPCA, and Teach for America. Colbert el dos' winnings are pledged to attract a stork to his owners' house. The owners, Bryan and his wife, Allyson, are newlyweds and are hoping to use the prize money for in vitro fertilization treatments to start a family. Colbert el dos' owners asked not to have their last names published to protect their privacy. There is some controversy over the weekly contest results. When the polls closed on Saturday at midnight Pacific time, Mozart was up by 131 votes. But on Monday the competition posted a message on its blog saying Mozart's fans had cheated. ""Mozart obviously worked very hard to receive over 4,500 valid votes in Week 8, but it's unfortunate that the judges had to remove 428 votes due to excessive voter accounts.""  The Cutest Dog Competition Web site, run by the All American Pet Brands, also said, ""there is no evidence that Mozart's owner had any part in the creation of these fraudulent accounts. Colbert's votes showed no signs of cheating."" More than 60,000 people have uploaded photos of their adorable dogs to the contest's Web site. Voters have to register an e-mail account with the competition. The rules state only one vote per e-mail address per day. ""The fraudulent accounts, with e-mail addresses only one number apart, were all created on the same days, from the same computers, and all votes cast from these 70-plus accounts were received within one minute of each other from the same computers (which generally means the owner of these accounts simply logged off and logged back onto another account to vote again),"" according to the competition Web site. Bryan said he was shocked when he found out on Monday his dog had won. ""On Saturday night, I went to bed and we were down 150 votes,"" he said. ""I know they announced the winners on the blog and I saw winner for Week 8 and I was expecting to see Mozart and I saw Stephen Colbert el dos and I just couldn't believe it."" He said it was a great day for the 7-month-old puppy and his owners. Their four-legged family includes three other dogs, all rescues, but they bought Colbert el dos from Puppies Galore in Lawrenceville, Georgia. When they met him, he was 2 months old, barely weighed a pound and would not eat. The manager of the store said the puppy was regressing after he was separated from his siblings. Now Stephen Colbert el dos is eating well and, ""He's as hyper as any puppy you'll see,"" Bryan said. Last week, they entered the competition and said they only told a few friends and family members. They posted a note on a Stephen Colbert fan site and support for the pooch went viral. A Web site said Colbert el dos had an invitation to appear on the ""Colbert Report"" if he made the top 12. Bryan said the TV show has not contacted them. Renata Luczak, a spokesperson for Comedy Central, could not confirm or deny the pet's booking, saying the ""Colbert Report"" ""refrains from commenting on upcoming guests appearing on the show."" Colbert el dos' owners denied having anything to do with the fraudulent votes for Mozart. ""We did not vote for Mozart a single time. And neither did anyone we know. Definitely no way,"" Bryan said. The human comedian Colbert has wreaked havoc in other online competitions, from a Hungarian bridge-naming contest to a NASA competition to name a room in the international space station. In both cases, Colbert won the popular vote. Hungary declined to name the bridge after Colbert. NASA, instead of naming the room in his honor, sent a treadmill to space with the Colbert honorific. In those contests, the competitions received heavy promotion during the show, with Colbert urging his viewers to participate. In the dog photo fight, Colbert had an impact without direct participation. MoMo was automatically re-entered in the competition for this week. Over the next four weeks, four more dogs will have a chance to be voted into the semifinals. After finishing in second place two weeks in a row, MoMo would appears to be the favorite to advance, where he could get another shot at Stephen Colbert el dos.","""Stephen Colbert el dos"" beats Mozart in dog beauty pageant .

"Copenhagen, Denmark (CNN)  -- U.N. chief Ban Ki-moon said Saturday a ""deal has been reached"" that could be the framework for a binding global climate change treaty. ""Finally we sealed the deal and it is a real deal. Bringing world leaders to the table paid off,"" Ban said, according to CNN affiliate TV2 Denmark. ""The Copenhagen Accord may not be everything that everyone hoped for but this decision of the conference of parties is a beginning, an essential beginning."" Moon said the non-binding deal called for all countries to limit global temperature rise to below two degrees Celsius. He said the deal was a step toward creating a legally binding treaty. ""The deal is backed by money and the means to deliver it. Up to $30 billion has been pledged for adaptations and mitigation,"" Ban said. Critics of the U.N. Climate Change Conference have said that without specific commitments from the leaders to actually cut carbon emissions it would be difficult to reach any target. Environmental group Greenpeace released a statement criticizing the deal. ""Don't believe the hype, there is nothing fair, ambitious or legally binding about this deal,"" Greenpeace said. ""The job of world leaders is not done. Today they shamefully failed to save us all from the effects of catastrophic climate change."" U.S. President Barack Obama praised the deal Friday before leaving the conference in Copenhagen, Denmark. ""For the first time in history, all major economies have come together to accept their responsibility to take action to confront the threat of climate change,"" Obama told reporters. The president said he met with leaders from India, China, Brazil and South Africa, and ""that's where we agreed ... to set a mitigation target to limit warming to no more than 2 degrees Celsius."" It's a nonbinding goal, and the emissions targets ""will not be by themselves sufficient to get to where we need to get by 2050,"" Obama said. However, he added that it is a first step, and that for many countries ""this is going to be the first time in which even voluntary they offered up mitigation targets."" ""I think that it was important to essentially get that shift in orientation moving,"" Obama said. The president said he believes it's necessary that the countries get to a legally binding treaty, but said, ""If we just waited for that, we would not make any progress."" The deal calls on nations to submit their ""concrete commitments"" into an appendix attached to the agreement to specifically lay out each country's intentions for climate change, Obama said. Those commitments will be subjected to an international ""consultation and analysis"" that will help foster accountability among the nations.

Another senior administration official had said the precise details of the agreement were still in some flux, so it was unclear whether the final version would include language that was in earlier drafts aimed at forcing nations to set legally binding targets for reducing emissions.

"(CNN) -- A former hospital worker systematically shot and killed four people in upstate New York on Saturday, authorities in two counties said. Former hospital worker Frank Garcia, 34, has been accused in the shooting rampage. Frank Garcia, 34, was arrested Saturday afternoon. Garcia knew all four victims, police said, but they didn't reveal details about the relationships. ""The individuals who were shot were known to the suspect. It was not necessarily a random act,"" Monroe County Sheriff Patrick O'Flynn said. The first two victims -- Mary Sillman, 23, and Randall Norman, 41 -- were fatally shot before 5 a.m. at Lakeside Memorial Hospital in Brockport, where Garcia was once employed, O'Flynn said. Another woman was wounded and is undergoing treatment at a nearby hospital, he said. The second shooting happened at a house in nearby Ontario County on Saturday afternoon. Christopher Glatz, 45, and his wife, Kim, 38, were killed ""execution-style"" while their two teenagers were in the suburban Rochester home, Ontario County Sheriff Philip Povero said. The teens were not wounded, but it is unclear whether they witnessed the event. Povero said neighbors reported Garcia went door-to-door looking for the Glatzes' home. ""He was in fact looking for the residence,"" Povero said. ""He was saying different things to different people, but he was clearly looking for that home."" Ballistic evidence has connected the two crime scenes, Povero said. Investigators found the matching brass cartridges from a pistol found on Garcia when he was arrested, he said. Garcia was arrested at a restaurant Saturday afternoon, CNN affiliate R-News in Rochester reported. Garcia was to be arraigned Saturday night in Monroe County, where the first shootings occurred, on two counts of first-degree murder and one count of attempted murder in the second degree, O'Flynn said. Sillman was a certified nursing assistant at Lakeside's long-term care center, hospital officials said. ""During Mary's brief time within the system, those who worked closest with Mary described her as warm, kind and compassionate toward the residents of Lakeside Beikirch Care Center,"" Lakeside interim CEO Michael Stapleton said in a statement. Garcia likely will face similar charges in Ontario County, Povero said. ""This certainly speaks to a tragedy that is enormous, not only the taking of the lives that were taken, but the people that were left behind, the person in Brockport and the two teenage children who were present when their mother was systematically murdered,"" Povero said.","Suspect went door-to-door in search of victims' residence, authorities say .

"New York (CNN) -- An Egyptian cobra that turned into a media darling after its escape and subsequent capture at New York's Bronx Zoo was named Mia on Thursday after a public vote. The name is a play on the days when the snake was missing in action, zoo officials said. The Bronx Zoo and New York Daily News asked the public to vote on the best name for the mischievous cobra.  After receiving more than 34,000 suggestions, officials whittled the list down to five nominations before Mia was chosen. Mia received 15,972 votes, or 27 percent of the total vote, a zoo statement said. The four runners-up were Subira, which means patient in Egypt, with 14,016 votes (24 percent); Amaunet, an ancient Egyptian goddess, meaning 'the female hidden one,"" with 11,672 votes (20 percent); Cleopatra, the last ruler of ancient Egypt who supposedly killed herself by means of an Egyptian cobra bite, with 10,730 votes (18 percent); and Agnes, Greek for pure or holy and also a reference to St. Agnes, with 6,777 votes (11 percent). ""Now that Mia has received her official name and has settled into her exhibit at the Bronx Zoo's Reptile House, the building will be re-opened to the public on Saturday, April 9 and visitors will be able to see her for the first time,"" the statement said. But an anonymous Twitter feed on behalf of the once missing cobra appeared defiant. ""So, the vote is in. They want to name me Mia,"" the posting said. ""But in my heart I'll always know that my true name is Mrs. Justin Bieber."" The 3-ounce, 20-inch reptile slithered out of her enclosure on March 26 and turned up five days later after zoo officials scattered rodent-scented wood shavings to lure her out in hopes of a meal. Zoo officials don't know how the snake got out, director Jim Breheny said this week. ""Anyone who has ever dealt with snakes or kept snakes knows that they are notorious as escape artists,"" Breheny said Monday. The disappearance of an animal whose venom can kill an elephant in three hours and a human in 15 minutes sparked more amusement than panic, drawing 200,000 followers to an anonymously authored Twitter feed. It had the snake taking tours of the city and threatening to drop down the chimneys of unsuspecting city dwellers. All the attention has brought plenty of notice to the zoo, Breheny said with a laugh. ""It certainly has put us out there,"" he said. ""But we would have preferred to be out there for another reason.""","The snake was named Mia after vote sponsored by Bronx Zoo and newspaper, officials say .

"Karachi, Pakistan (CNN)  -- At a morgue in Pakistan's largest city, five linen pouches -- each the size of a loaf of bread -- line the shelf of a walk-in freezer. Wrapped inside each small sack is the corpse of an infant. The babies are victims of what one relief agency calls Pakistan's worst unfolding tragedy: the killing and dumping of newborns. ""Sometimes they hang them, and sometimes they kill by the knife, and sometimes we find bodies which have been burned,"" said Anwar Kazmi, a manager at Edhi Foundation, Pakistan's largest privately run social service and relief agency. Records at Edhi Foundation show that more than 1,200 newborns were killed and dumped in Pakistan last year, an increase of about 200 from the previous year. Families view many of these children as illegitimate in a culture that condemns those born outside of marriage. Statistics show that roughly nine out of 10 are baby girls, which families may consider too costly to keep in a country where women frequently are not allowed to work. The babies are usually just days old. Their corpses are often dumped in Karachi's sprawling garbage dumps, where they're sometimes mutilated by street animals, Kazmi said. He estimates that hundreds of baby corpses are never found. The head of Edhi Foundation, 83-year-old Abdul Sattar Edhi, blames Pakistan's crippling poverty and a government that, for decades, has failed to educate the masses, generate jobs and provide citizens with the most basic needs. ""The distribution of resources by the government is wrong,"" Edhi said. ""Many people don't pay taxes; there's no charity, and what you get from the government is all based on your wealth."" The Pakistani government has said it's improving education, but 55 million Pakistanis remain illiterate, according to the United Nations. And the government is billions of dollars in debt while entangled in a costly fight against the Taliban and other Islamic militant groups. The killing of newborns gets little attention in Pakistan, and rarely are they investigated by a police force that's often poorly trained, lacks resources and stays focused on what's perceived to be more important crimes. In many parts of the world, female infanticide is still practiced through direct violence but also by intentional neglect, according to the World Health Organization. In some Asian countries, infanticide of girls is enough to skew the population figures in favor of males. The United Nations found, for example, that there are 130 boys to 100 girls in parts of Asia, especially in countries with extreme poverty and overpopulation such as China and India. ""Girls are seen as a burden, seen as a property which belongs to somebody else so people see that as a waste of money and the wasting of an education of a girl,"" said Bhagyashri Dengle, executive director of Plan India, a nonprofit for children. ""Then when the girl gets married, the families have a big, heavy dowry. So that is one of the reasons here."" Dengle said awareness and education at the grass-roots level are ways to combat this practice. ""I think we really need to reach out to young people (to) create an awareness, to change attitudes and dispel the notion that having a boy is better than a girl,"" she said. ""We launched this program 'Let Girls Be Born' -- that campaign is reaching out to masses using televisions, through newspapers and through (the) Internet. What we are trying to do is positive messaging on the girls. That girls aren't a sect; they are as good as boys."" In Pakistan, until things improve, the Edhi Foundation said, it will keep more than 300 cradles in front of its offices throughout Pakistan where families can drop off unwanted newborns. The foundation cares for them and puts them up for adoption, no questions asked. ""It's for awareness -- that please don't kill your innocent babies,"" Kazmi said.","Records from group show more than 1,200 newborns killed and dumped in Pakistan last year .
Many of those killed are girls because of cultural attitudes and poverty .
In some countries, infanticide of girls is enough to skew population figures, U.N. says ."
"San Antonio (CNN) -- Clerks scheduling medical appointments for veterans were ""cooking the books"" at their bosses' behest to hide the fact some had to wait weeks, if not months, for appointments, a VA scheduler in San Antonio said Thursday. The Office of Inspector General confirms to CNN that it has staff investigators on the ground in San Antonio looking into the allegations. The allegations surrounding this Texas VA hospital comes as the federal department fends off claims of potentially deadly delays at other facilities, including claims of a secret wait list in Phoenix that was first reported by CNN. Phoenix VA officials deny secret wait list; doctors say they're lying . The VA's official policy is that all patients should be able to see a doctor, dentist or some other medical professional within 14 days of their requested/preferred date. Any wait longer than two weeks is supposed to documented. Yet Brian Turner, a Veterans Affairs scheduling clerk based in San Antonio, said Thursday that some who called to make appointments at his facility did end up waiting longer, yet such delays were never reported. For example, he said, they might be told the next available appointment wasn't for several months. It would be scheduled for then, but marked in official files as if the patient had put off their appointment until then by choice. ""What we've been instructed was that -- they are not saying fudged, there is no secret wait list -- but what they've done is come out and just say 'zero out that date,' "" Turner said. The ""zero,"" in this case, suggests the patient didn't have to wait at all. ""It could be three months and look like no days (wait),"" he added. ""It looked like they had scheduled the appointment and got exactly what they wanted."" The Veterans Affairs public affairs office said that Turner's allegation has been looked into, without any finding of wrongdoing. ""Based on our internal fact-finding conducted April 25-28, we found the claims by this employee were not substantiated,"" the VA statement said. However, the Office of Inspector General says it is conducting its own investigation. Turner tells CNN he has already been interviewed by OIG staff. The claim comes amid strong public pressure on the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and its leader, Eric Shinseki, after CNN reporting unveiled e-mails that allegedly discussed the destruction of a secret list of veterans waiting for care at a Phoenix VA hospital. Shinseki has ordered a ""face-to-face audit"" at VA clinics, a department spokesman said on Thursday. Earlier the same day, a House committee voted to subpoena Shinseki in the wake of such accusations that his department is responsible for deadly delays in health care. Shinseki orders 'face-to-face audit' at clinics . Turner told CNN that he's become a witness in an investigation by the VA inspector general's office focusing on delayed care, alleged falsification of records and possible medical harm to veterans at the San Antonio facility. Turner, a former Army soldier himself who still works at the VA, said he has asked to be protected under federal whistle-blower laws. As to the VA's earlier fact-finding efforts, Turner said that no one asked him about his allegations. In fact, he said, when he began expressing his concerns to other staff members, he was called in and told not to e-mail another person. ""They shut me up the very next day,"" Turner said.

"(CNN) -- As we well know, ISIS is recruiting angry young men as far afield as Minneapolis and London. The allure is much like the allure of a street gang -- in part, because ISIS looks an awful lot like a street gang. Gangs have long been understood as a collective response or ""solution"" to the strains encountered by their respective members. For some youth, ISIS has become the ""solution."" They are searching for the same protection and respect that pull people into gangs. The difference is they are pushed by feelings of marginalization, victimization, and vulnerability that stem from the state's purported failure to protect Muslim interests. ""Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate,"" Yoda once said. Anger also incites people to action, lowers inhibitions, and fashions a desire for revenge. There are legitimate concerns about radicalization among existing gang members, because they typically live out the same sociocultural and racial exclusion. Gang members already hold more anti-authority attitudes than the rest of us. Add to this the fact many of them go to prison each year, where they come into contact with radicalized individuals and are subject to influence, and the die has been cast. For some gang members, joining ISIS could even make real the mythologized gang life that made gang membership originally so appealing. Real gang life -- where gang members stand around in the rain waiting for something to happen, or beg, borrow, and steal converted imitation firearms to make good on their threats -- rarely lives up to the hype. Hence, many real gang members still live at home with their mothers. ISIS, by contrast, lives up to the myth. ISIS is armed to the teeth with samurai swords and Kalashnikovs. ISIS governs vast territories and shapes futures. ISIS, flush with oil money, pays far better than minimum wage. ISIS is the street gang on steroids. Like many gangs, ISIS grew out of another group (al Qaeda in Iraq,) evolved under charismatic authority (Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi,) made some territorial gains (Syria and Iraq,) changed its name a few times (IS, ISIS, ISIL,) and, eventually, provoked a militarized response. In no way does this diminish the threat ISIS poses. In gang colors, dissing a rival gang in a self-produced YouTube video earns you five minutes of fame at best. Under ISIS's black flag, beheading an aid worker guarantees life in 24-hour news in perpetuity. Having studied how gangs work, I know first-hand some gang members are Islamists. Others are attracted by the concept of terrorism. When gang members identify with Islam, however, it is only on a superficial level. Above all, gang members desire to be feared, thus, as in the Muslim Boys case in London, they strategically pose as jihadists and trade on powerful false perceptions about links to al Qaeda. Both groups also look for all possible ways to enhance their reputation for violence because violence has a property that other commodities lack: A reputation for violence reduces the need for actual violence. To this end, just as Internet-based forms of communication play a key role in the cultural transmission of gang symbols and practice, technology also ""advances the motives and accelerates the methods of radicalization."" Contrary to popular belief, however, neither gangs nor terrorist groups formally ""recruit"" via the Internet because ""cheap talk"" online cannot be trusted. Another thing gangs and terrorists group share, is a deep tension between personnel needs and infiltration risks. As a result, many are called to both groups but few are chosen. Material incentives attract opportunists, so groups screen for commitment. Illegal activity attracts law enforcement, so they also screen for trustworthiness. Terrorists recruit in mosques for the same reasons gangs recruit in neighborhoods -- racial and ethnic homogeneity and residential stability inherently promote trust and, in the context of repeated interaction, reputations are acquired and authenticated. But radicalization, like gang membership, lives on a spectrum. Radicalization, like gang membership, is also a gradual process. It begins with personal relationships. Lost men congregate at mosques, in neighborhoods, and online, finding others like them. They build friendships around their faith and its obligations or along the lines of shared identities and social networks. Eventually, this ""bunch of guys"" comes to constitute a closed society that provides a sense of meaning that otherwise does not exist in the larger world. Terror intervention, like gang intervention, needs an emphasis not on the traditional ""hot spots"" for radicalization, but rather the ""hot people"" most deeply embedded in extremist networks. This is important. The old ""hot spot"" approach to gang suppression alienated communities of color by reinforcing the ""us versus them"" mentality that forced many people into gangs in the first place. Our current version of ""shock and awe"" in response to ISIS risks prompting retaliation for the same reason: It gives legitimacy to the extremist argument that the West is complicit in the death of Muslims around the world. As they say in the gang, if you live by the gun, you die by the gun. To bring peace, both on the streets and in Syria, underlying social and political grievances must be addressed.

"(CNN) -- Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah repeated his stance that Israel was behind the killing of Lebanon's former prime minister six years ago and slammed the U.N.-backed court for sowing discord in Lebanon. ""The tribunal was established for an obvious political goal, and no one is allowed to investigate Israel,"" he said on Lebanese TV Saturday, explaining his position on the Special Tribunal for Lebanon's indictments in connection with the 2005 attack, which left Rafik Hariri and 22 others dead. ""Instead of investigating with Israel, they cooperated with Israel."" The tribunal submitted to Lebanese authorities a sealed indictment and arrest warrants this week for an unknown number of suspects. A highly placed source in the Lebanese Army told CNN the four include Mustafa Badreddine, Hasan Oneisa, Salim Ayyah and Asad Sabra -- all Hezbollah members. Many Lebanese believe the killing revolved around the controversies over Syria's role in Lebanon, occupied at the time by Syrian troops, and the Damascus government's strong political influence in Lebanon. Many Lebanese believe Hariri wanted the Syrians to withdraw from Lebanon and lessen Syria's influence, and many suspect that Syria and its ally Hezbollah went after Hariri because of his stance on this issue. Hezbollah is a Shiite political faction in Lebanon that provides social services to its constituents. It has long been regarded as a terrorist organization by the United States and as an ally of Iran. It has had longstanding animosity toward the tribunal, based on the expectation that some of its members would be indicted as conspirators in Hariri's assassination. Nasrallah has accused the group's arch-enemy Israel of the assassination. Nasrallah also criticized the Special Tribunal for Lebanon, which issued the indictments, for sowing discord. ""We cannot cancel the tribunal because the tribunal was created by the U.N. Security Council that is ruled by the American will,"" he told viewers of al-Manar, the Lebanese TV station affiliated with Hezbollah. ""The most dangerous goal of this tribunal is to create strife, a civil war in Lebanon, or especially a division between the Sunni and Shiite in Lebanon."" A U.N. source familiar with the tribunal said the people indicted include alleged perpetrators on the ground. Badreddine -- who is the brother-in-law of Imad Mughniyeh, a former Hezbollah commander who was assassinated in Syria in 2008 -- is reported to be a member of Hezbollah's advisory council. Two additional lists of indictments are expected later this summer and are expected to include the organizers and planners of the attack, the U.N. source said. Those suspected connections of Hezbollah and the Syrian government to the killing have raised tensions in the country, stoking fears of sectarian conflict erupting in the ethnically and religiously diverse nation, which endured a civil war from 1975 to 1990. Syria had thousands of troops in Lebanon and great influence in the country until mass protests after Hariri's assassination, known as the Cedar Revolution, forced their withdrawal. Syria has denied any involvement in the assassination. Another result of the anger toward the attack was the creation of the tribunal. The United Nations and the Lebanese Republic negotiated an agreement on the establishment of the body, based in the Netherlands.","Hezbollah's Nasrallah: ""No one is allowed to investigate Israel""

"(CNN) -- Way before people such as Roseanne Barr, Kathy Griffin and Rosie O'Donnell broke ground for women in comedy, there was Phyllis Diller. She got started in the late '50s, a time when female stand-up comics were a rarity. At this time, the concept of a woman's place was truly that it was in the home; women weren't supposed to be funny. And as much as they say nowadays that comedy and show business is a boys' club, it doesn't compare with the way it used to be. Phyllis found her way in. Today, some women may condemn other women for doing self-deprecating comedy, but Phyllis did it and she took it to an art form and it wasn't threatening, it wasn't angry and, just in a nutshell, when all else failed, it was just plain funny. Diller dies 'with a smile on her face' People have many theories about comedy, but being just plain funny is the one most important thing. You could not call Phyllis just a funny stand-up comic. She was a gifted performer -- an actress equally adept at comedy and drama. After her first big appearances on ""The Jack Paar Show"" brought her national fame, she had a successful career in movies, as a stage actress, at comedy clubs, on TV and on comedy albums. When I was a child, TV was packed with variety shows, and she seemed to always be on the air. She was the ultimate downtrodden, frustrated housewife. She portrayed it to a freakish degree. I remember her coming on to the screen with what looked like a fright wig. Her hair looked like she had just stuck her finger in an electric socket. Her dresses would be inappropriately short, and she would be holding her ever-ready, impossibly long cigarette holder. She appeared to be someone who would be a hero in the gay community, which she was. But Phyllis was a hero for everyone. Her jokes were always self-effacing and hysterically funny. Here's one: ""You know you're getting old when your blood type's been discontinued."" Here's another: ""I love to go to the doctor. Where else would a man look at me and say, 'Take off your clothes?' "" She used to talk about having a husband named ""Fang."" No one ever saw this ""Fang"" fellow, but to the TV public, he was mythical. We didn't know him, but we all knew him. He was stupid, frustrating and incompetent. We all had a very clear picture of him in our minds. She was much smarter than he was. Because Phyllis was clearly smart. She did USO tours through South Vietnam with Bob Hope, and it is a testament to her skill that she could hold her own against a comedian like Hope. But that's what a trouper does. She was born in 1917 and had an incredibly long career, recently doing voice-over work on shows such as ""Family Guy."" I had the honor and privilege of appearing three times with Phyllis. We were both guest judges on ""Last Comic Standing,"" and we appeared together on ""Hollywood Squares."" We also were both in the documentary ""The Aristocrats,"" the film about the dirtiest joke ever told, proving Phyllis was no prude. In the documentary, after they show me performing the joke, they cut to a reaction of Phyllis fainting. I felt extremely honored. When I worked with her in recent years, I'll say she looked roughly 1,000 years old, but walked without a cane, was more than totally alert, funny, outspoken and a true pro. She autographed her book for me and gave it to me as a present. I was so touched that I didn't even consider selling it on eBay. Recently there were reports of Phyllis' declining health. I think she stopped working at that point, or worked less, at least. I don't know if her failing health killed her, or just not being able to perform like she used to. In any case, whenever you watch comedians, male or female, they owe a great debt to Phyllis Diller. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gilbert Gottfried.","Gilbert Gottfried: Phyllis Diller did stand-up when women weren't supposed to be funny .

"(CNN) -- Authorities conducting autopsies on a family of four found dead in in their home in eastern Missouri said preliminary autopsy results showed that the family may have died from carbon monoxide inhalation, police said Friday. The four -- a couple in their late 20s, their 4-year-old son and their 3-year-old daughter -- were found dead Thursday afternoon, said police in the city of St. Clair. Police had been summoned to the house after the man's co-workers became concerned that he had not gone to work for several days, said police Chief Bill Hammack. Inside, officers found the four bodies but no indication of foul play, he said. Family members told police they had last been in contact with the family Tuesday, when he complained that he was feeling sick and nauseated, Hammack said. According the Center for Disease Control, each year, nearly 500 people die in the United States from carbon monoxide poisoning, and as many as 20,000 visit emergency rooms for exposure from poorly maintained heating systems and gas-powered generators. ""Dangers from poorly maintained heating systems are really going to be the number one cause of carbon monoxide poisonings in the United States,"" Dr. Paul Garbe said on a CDC online video. ""CDC recommends that all homes have carbon monoxide detectors,"" Garbe said. ""I think it's a great investment. It's particularly important that you have carbon monoxide detectors near where people sleep at night. The worst location for a carbon monoxide detector is in the box without a battery,"" he said.","Police find no indication of foul play .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- A leader of the anti-government Red Shirts has died after being wounded by a sniper's bullet during protests last week, hospital officials confirmed Monday. Maj. Gen. Khattiya Sawasdipol was a renegade general better known as Seh Daeng, which means Red Commander. Tensions in Bangkok ramped up when Sawasdipol was shot and wounded by a sniper's bullet Thursday. His death came after four days of clashes between anti-government protesters and security forces killed 35 people -- with 11 of those deaths occurring in sporadic fighting throughout Sunday and overnight. The Erawan Emergency Center also announced Monday that the fatalities include a soldier, the first such death since fighting broke out. The government declared a holiday Monday and Tuesday ""in order to ensure the safety of the public"" after the protests paralyzed the city center. iReport: Are you there? Send your images, video . ""It's a situation that doesn't appear to be getting any better,"" CNN reporter Dan Rivers said as dawn broke Monday. At least nine international embassies in Bangkok -- including the U.S., British, Belgium, Canadian, German, Japanese, New Zealand, Swedish and Australian embassies -- said they will remain closed until Tuesday at the earliest as a result of the clashes. Meanwhile, an ""intense and fierce"" gun battle broke out late Sunday in the city's Lumpini Park, where anti-government protesters have amassed by the thousands, according to Rivers, who was near the scene. On the scene: Bangkok at boiling point . The battle came hours after the Thai government called on the protesters to stop the violence, but stopped short of agreeing to a demand that the United Nations mediate between the parties. Rivers said the gunshots sounded like automatic gunfire and were punctuated by explosions. It was unclear, he said, whether the shooting came from the Thai military or the protesters. The normally bustling city was ""deadly quiet"" except for the gunfire, Rivers said. ""This is not the Bangkok that I have known over the last four years. This has suddenly become a very different and much more scary place."" Also Sunday, some women and children were moved into a Buddhist temple for safety, away from the clashes. A spokesman for the Royal Thai police said a group of doctors were traveling to the temple Monday to provide medical care. The government extended its state of emergency to five more provinces, bringing the total to 22 provinces along with the Bangkok metropolitan area, spokesman Panitan Wattanayagorn said in a televised news conference. The provinces mainly are in north and northeastern Thailand, where the anti-government Red Shirts' strongholds are located. The government has also banned financial transactions with 106 companies and individuals over the protests, Panitan said. Throughout the day Sunday, black smoke billowed and gunshots rang out in the capital's streets, which have turned into battle zones during the bitter standoff. Nearly 240 people have been injured in the clashes since Thursday, emergency officials said. Earlier, the government said it would declare a curfew in Bangkok and that no one would be allowed in the streets, but it reversed course several hours later, saying the tense situation was under control. Minutes later, the anti-government United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship (UDD), also known as the Red Shirts, said it was willing to negotiate an end to the unrest if troops move out of the area where protesters have amassed by the thousands for weeks. ""We ask the government to ... withdraw troops out of surrounding area,"" said Natthawut Saikua of the UDD. ""We are ready to enter talks immediately by having the United Nations as mediator for this negotiation."" However, the government seemed disinclined to have the United Nations mediate. Panitan said in the news conference the Thai government has a policy of not allowing organizations to intervene in its internal affairs. The government has its own sovereignty, Panitan said, and can resolve its own problems. Panitan said the government demands that the protesters stop confronting police. ""Stop firing and enter the judicial process,"" he said. ""The government has been under pressure to be more decisive in its action,"" a senior Thai government official said. ""We have been showing patience and restraint."" That, he said, has upset those who want the government to take action against the protesters. What are the protests about? The official said the Red Shirts are ""armed to the teeth"" with weapons including rocket launchers, handguns and gas bombs, and accused protesters of deliberately provoking clashes with soldiers in order to get ""pictures of soldiers using violence to undermine the government."" ""If the protesters didn't have any arms, there would be no way the soldiers need to be armed,"" the official said. ""... They have been rallying people to burn the town down. They have shown intent in using and causing violence (and a) willingness to follow up with that intent. In that situation government ... has to act."" The hard-core protesters ""don't want a peace offer,"" the official said. ""They don't want a peaceful resolution to this."" While CNN reporters in Bangkok have not seen protesters using rocket launchers, it is believed they may have them. ""If the Thai army was shooting indiscriminately on the streets, there would be hundreds dead,"" the senior government official said. ""That is not the case."" The official did acknowledge that there is some army shooting, however, because of high tensions. Col. Sunsern Kaewkamnerd of the Center for Resolution of Emergency Situation said soldiers have been authorized to open fire when armed people approach within a certain distance. If officials impose a curfew, men will need to register before leaving the affected area, authorities said. Demonstrators who leave before then may be exempt from charges for participating in illegal demonstrations, Sunsern said. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva said the new school term would start May 24 -- a week after the scheduled reopening on Monday -- because of the violence. During his weekly televised address Saturday, Abhisit warned that the longer the protest continues, the higher the risk for the public. Abhisit said the government's actions were necessary to prevent Thailand from sinking into lawlessness. He said security forces and his administration are attempting to counter a small group of protesters among the opposition Red Shirts trying to foment civil war. ""The government proposed a reconciliation plan but it was rejected. This benefits no one. It only benefits a small group which wants to harm the country and lead it to civil war. It is unbelievable that they use peoples' lives for political advantage,"" he said. Protesters armed with slingshots and firecrackers huddled behind barricades of tires, spikes and poles Sunday. They set tires alight to create smokescreens as bullets flew around them. Eyewitnesses Saturday recounted stories of unarmed people being picked off. One man was shot and whisked away by emergency crews. People at the scene pointed to a building where they thought snipers were based. The escalating violence prompted the U.S. Embassy to issue a travel warning Saturday advising Americans to defer travel to Bangkok, spokeswoman Cynthia Brown said. The government said it was forced to take action after demonstrators disregarded an ultimatum by Abhisit to vacate a key intersection by Wednesday. The United Front for Democracy has been demanding that Abhisit dissolve the lower house of Parliament and call new elections. The Red Shirts support former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a 2006 bloodless military coup. But the senior government official accused Thaksin of being behind the unrest. ""This movement is fully financed, organized and paid for by Thaksin,"" he said. ""At the moment, they are holding Thailand (for) ransom."" The official noted there were two pro-Thaksin governments after his ouster before Abhisit took office and insisted the current government is legitimate.

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Simon Monjack's death two months ago was caused by acute pneumonia and severe anemia, according to a Los Angeles County coroner spokesman. ""Just like Brittany,"" Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter said, referring to actress Brittany Murphy, Monjack's wife, who died five months earlier. Some prescription drugs were detected in his system, but not in lethal levels, Winter said. Sharon Murphy issued a statement saying the preliminary findings should ""stop the reckless innuendos that my daughter and son-in-law misused any kind of prescription medications."" ""It is with great relief that Simon's preliminary autopsy findings have been released, so the media speculations can stop,"" Murphy said. ""As I was sure of, just like my daughter Brittany, there was no kind of drug overdose."" One more test will be conducted, at Monjack's family's request, before a full autopsy report is released in about two weeks, Winter said. Monjack, a 39-year-old British screenwriter, was found dead at his Hollywood home May 23, according to the coroner's office. Murphy, his wife of less than three years, died in the same home last December. Murphy, 32, died from a combination of pneumonia, an iron deficiency and multiple drug intoxication, a coroner said. The drugs involved were legal and used to treat a respiratory infection, according to an autopsy. The often bubbly, free-spirited actress appeared in films such as ""Clueless,"" ""8 Mile,"" ""Don't Say a Word"" and ""Girl, Interrupted."" She also lent her voice to animated works, including the movie ""Happy Feet"" -- in which she also sang -- and a regular role on the animated TV series ""King of the Hill.""","NEW: Murphy's mom: ""Reckless innuendos"" about drugs should stop .

"Washington (CNN) -- They have become staples of many cable and broadcast television stations: high-speed, often dangerous police pursuits of fleeing motorists, videotaped and packaged into such shows as ""World's Wildest Police Chases."" In an appeal that came to the Supreme Court, the issue was: When do such incidents cross over into the realm of ""violent felonies"" that could lead to increased jail time? The justices, by a 6-3 vote Thursday, dismissed an appeal from an Indiana man who received an enhanced federal sentence because of prior serious offenses, one of which was for trying to escape in a vehicle. Justice Anthony Kennedy said that while the federal law in question does not specifically mention dangerous car chases, they clearly are the kind of crime that deserves to be treated more seriously. ""Risk of violence is inherent to vehicle flight,"" Kennedy said. ""It is well known that when offenders use motor vehicles as their means of escape they create serious potential risks of physical injury to others. Flight from a law enforcement officer invites, even demands, pursuit."" Marcus Sykes had pleaded guilty to felony possession of a firearm, a federal offense. He had attempted to rob two people at gunpoint, according to court records. He also had at least three prior felonies on his record, including an armed robbery. It was the third felony that concerned the high court. Indiana's ""resisting law enforcement"" law provides various criteria, depending on the circumstances, for those who flee officers. Sykes had at one time used a vehicle to escape after an officer had ordered him to stop, which is a felony under state law. Officers had noticed Sykes driving without headlights, and when police flashed their emergency sirens, the suspect took off and a chase ensued. Prosecutors said Sykes drove on the wrong side of the road and through yards with residents nearby, then rammed a fence and finally crashed into a house. He fled on foot and was eventually captured, thanks to a police dog in pursuit. Under the federal Armed Criminal, Career Criminal Act, Sykes received a mandatory minimum 15-year prison term for the gun possession charge, enhanced because of his past criminal record. The law was designed to get tough with habitual felons through longer sentences. Sykes appealed, admitting he fled police and that it was a felony, but he argued it was not violent"" The federal law labels as violent felonies such offenses such as burglary, arson or extortion, or where there is ""conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another."" Kennedy said the ""serious potential risk"" standard applies to Sykes' driving behavior, since he repeatedly refused to pull over and submit to custody. ""As that pursuit continues, the risk of an accident accumulates,"" Kennedy wrote. ""And having chosen to flee, and thereby commit a crime, the perpetrator has all the more reason to avoid capture."" This is the fourth time in the past four years the high court has tried to clarify the meaning of ""violent felony"" under the so-called residual clauses of the federal law. In a typically sharp dissent, Justice Antonin Scalia said the law, like the majority's efforts to interpret its boundaries, is ultimately a failure. ""Today's opinion will sow further confusion,"" he wrote. ""Insanity, it has been said, is doing the same thing over and over again but expecting different results. Four times is enough"" in trying to clarify what are violent felonies under the career-criminal law. He said the statute should be declared ""void for vagueness."" Justice Elena Kagan also dissented, but for far different reasons. She said that under the state's own guidelines, Sykes' conduct was clear: there was no aggravated vehicular flight. ""Because petitioner Marcus Sykes was convicted only of simple vehicular flight, and not of any flight offense involving aggressive or dangerous activity, I would find he did not commit a 'violent felony'"" under the federal law. Supported by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Kagan said states properly distinguish among various types of efforts to escape police, and that the high court should have relied on those state standards to make its ruling, rather than trying to parse the federal law's definition of ""violent"" felony, which does not specifically include vehicular flight. Kennedy in his ruling cited a study by the International Association of Chiefs of Police showing that at least 7,737 police chases were reported nationwide from 2001 through 2007. Those pursuits resulted in 313 injuries to police and bystanders, or a rate of about 4-in-100. There was no indication whether the pursuit of Sykes was videotaped by a police dashboard camera, and if so, whether that visual record was used against him in the trial or subsequent appeals. The case was Sykes v. United States (09-11311).","""Risk of violence is inherent to vehicle flight,"" Justice Anthony Kennedy says .
The court rejects the argument that a car chase shouldn't lead to a stricter sentence .
Justice Scalia dissents, saying the law should be declared ""void for vagueness'
Justices Kagan and Ginsburg, in a separate dissent, argue there was no violent felony ."
"Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) -- Thousands of Turks marched through Istanbul in a demonstration calling for improved rights and greater social acceptance for the country's homosexual community. Activists say the annual Turkish Gay Pride Parade, now in its ninth year, is the only march of its kind in a majority-Muslim country. Several thousand supporters of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights carried signs and rainbow flags as they made their way down one of Istanbul's busiest pedestrian thoroughfares. Participants chanted slogans against harassment and blew whistles, waved large rainbow flags and carried signs in Turkish and English that sported messages like ""We're everywhere, get used to it"" and ""Dance, dance, against homophobia, dance."" Other signs referenced Ahmet Yildiz, a 26-year-old who was shot to death in Istanbul in 2008. Yildiz's father has been accused of traveling almost 600 miles to shoot him in what has been called an ""honor killing."" According to Yildiz's partner, Ibo, Yildiz sought protection from prosecutors after receiving threats of violence from his family. His case was featured in an Amnesty International report on the status of gays, lesbians, and transsexuals in Turkey titled ""Not An Illness, Nor A Crime."" The report says it later emerged that the prosecutor's office erroneously transferred the complaint to another office and failed to investigate the claims, in what some activists view as the unwillingness of the authorities to confront homophobic violence. Sunday's march blurred ethnic and religious lines. A group of about 20 Kurdish activists, fleeing police tear gas that was fired at an unrelated nearby political demonstration, were greeted by a round of applause as they joined the colorful crowd. Tear gas from the same demonstration wafted over parts of the crowd, causing the march to stall briefly as people took cover to stave off its effects. Gay rights organizations have accused Turkey's government of expressing hostile attitudes toward the country's homosexual community. Activists point to a statement made by Aliye Kavaf, Turkey's minister for women and family affairs. ""I believe homosexuality is a biological disorder, an illness, and should be treated,"" she said in a 2010 interview with the Turkish newspaper Hurriyet. One parade-goer, who was a part of a tango group moving through the crowd, wore a bright red head scarf with a checkered red, black, and white tie as she danced with her partner. The dancer, who wears a head scarf in daily life, said that Islam and homosexuality are not incongruous. ""Religion is not a fixed thing,"" said Iz, who declined to provide her last name. ""It has been interpreted throughout history, is still being interpreted and it needs to evolve."" In accession talks with the European Union, Turkey has been gradually improving its record on homosexuality as it makes changes to conform to EU policy on human rights laws. Many marchers on Sunday came out to improve social consciousness of homosexuality. ""The big-bellied, mustached men are looking, trying to figure out what's going on. They're learning what a rainbow is,"" said Natalie Aslan, 23.","Istanbul sees its ninth annual gay pride parade .

"Washington (CNN) -- House Appropriations Committee Chairman David Obey, a senior member of the congressional Democratic leadership, announced Wednesday that he is not seeking re-election this November. Obey, 71, represents Wisconsin's 7th Congressional District. He was the youngest member of Congress when he was elected to his first of 21 terms in 1969. He is the fourth-longest-serving House member, serving behind Democratic Reps. John Dingell and John Conyers, both of Michigan, and Florida Republican Rep. Bill Young. ""I think that along the way I've made a difference in the district and the state that I represent, and for the country. But there is a time to stay and a time to go, and this is my time to go,"" Obey said in announcing his decision. ""Frankly, I hate to do it. There is so much that needs to be done. But even more frankly, I am bone tired,"" he said. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi praised Obey as a ""transformational figure in the Congress."" ""He is a visionary for a better life for the American people and a legislative genius: he has an ability to see around corners, anticipate challenges and opportunities and sustain a fight on behalf of what is right. For nearly a half century, he's been an indefatigable reformer,"" she said. Obey said he considered retiring after the 2000 election, but he said he became so angered by the policies of the Bush administration ""that I decided to stick around as long as they were here."" He also said that when he was asked in the past if he was contemplating retirement, he would tell reporters he didn't want to retire until Congress passed health care reform. ""Well, now it has, and I can leave with the knowledge that thanks to Speaker Pelosi and President Obama and so many others, we got the job done. I haven't done all of the big things that I wanted to do when I started out, but I've done all of the big things that I'm likely to do,"" he said. Obey won the 2008 election with 61 percent of the vote. This term, he was expected to face Republican challenger Sean Duffy, the district attorney of Ashland County. Earlier this year, Time magazine named Duffy as one of 10 GOP contenders capable of providing a Scott Brown-like upset, referring to the Republican's surprise win in the Massachusetts Senate election. Duffy also appeared on the sixth season of MTV's ""The Real World."" The National Republican Congressional Committee issued a statement saying Obey was facing ""the race of his life."" ""That is why it is understandable that the architect of President Obama's failed stimulus plan has decided to call it quits. It is ironic that a congressman who became infamously known for his short temper and angry tirades on the House floor, is going out with such a whimper,"" NRCC communications director Ken Spain said in a statement. The nonpartisan Rothenberg Political Report had characterized the district as ""leaning Democratic."" The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee praised Obey as a ""tireless voice for progress on behalf of his constituents in Wisconsin and middle class families across America"" and disputed the notion that his job was at risk. ""His success in writing a new code of ethics for the House of Representatives and ensuring passage of our historic health insurance reforms will stand as Chairman Obey's proud legacy,"" DCCC Chairman Chris Van Hollen said in a statement. ""Chairman Obey would have won re-election again had he run. We are confident that a Democrat who shares Chairman Obey's commitment to making progress for Wisconsin's middle class families will succeed him as the next Representative of Wisconsin's 7th Congressional District."" Obey also expressed confidence that he would have held on to his seat. ""Let me put it this way -- I have won 25 elections,"" Obey said. ""Does anybody really think I don't know how to win another one? Or, for that matter, has anyone ever seen me walk away from a fight in my life?"" ""The fact is there isn't a chance of a snowball in Hades of that progressive congressional district electing someone who is a poor imitation of George Bush's policies on a bad day,"" Obey added to applause. Obey said he believes the job of a good politician is to be ""used up"" fighting for causes one believes in, and then stepping aside to let someone else carry on the battle. ""Well today folks, I feel used up,"" he said. Obey said he wasn't sure what he planned to do next, but joked, ""All I do know is that there has to be more to life than explaining the ridiculous accountability-destroying rules of the United States Senate to confused and angry and frustrated constituents.""

"Huntington Beach, California (CNN) -- Danny Thompson, son of racing legend Mickey Thompson, will have to wait another year to write the family name into the official record book at the Bonneville Salt Flats. Thompson's pursuit of the land speed record for a piston engine car -- 439 mph -- was jinxed by rain at Bonneville's annual Speed Week in August, and again at the event intended to make up for the lost time. The Southern California Timing Association, which tallies the records, announced late Sunday that it was raining in Bonneville and that the salt would be too soggy for racing this weekend. ""Bad news,"" Thompson said in a text message. ""The SCTA just canceled World Finals due to rain. That's the end of the season."" Rain might have ended the 2014 racing season but not the dream, Thompson told fans in an announcement, which was accompanied by a photo of him looking exasperated. ""Thank you to my amazing team, my faithful sponsors, and all of you for your support over the past year,"" he said. ""The dream isn't dead, and the Challenger II will return to the salt. See you then."" Last month, Thompson came within 20 mph of the record held by George Poteet, who survived a 370 mph crash last month at Cook's Shootout, another popular racing event. Thompson sought to break 392 mph to set the record for his vehicle class and hoped to be the first to drive a piston engine car 450 mph. Thompson drove Challenger II, named after his father's record-breaking car, 419 mph during one leg of his race, and reached a top speed of 424 mph. But his clutch failed on the return trip, and he fell short of the official record. The average speed of the two trips is needed for the record. While he ended the season short of the records he chased, Thompson has now matched the feats of his famous father. Mickey Thompson, known as the Speed King, was the first American to top 400 mph. He went 406.6 mph at Bonneville in 1960 but also broke down on the return trip. The following year, rain turned the salt flats into a shallow lake, and Mickey Thompson never held the official record. He planned a return to Bonneville to chase the record in 1988 with son Danny behind the wheel, but the elder Thompson was gunned down in the driveway of his Southern California home that February. In 2010, 50 years after his father's feat, Danny Thompson decided to rebuild the Challenger and renew the record chase.","Danny Thompson, son of racing legend, still chasing land speed record .

"(CNN) -- Three U.S. Army soldiers have received reprimands for misconduct in a prostitution scandal involving the U.S. Secret Service and other federal agents in Cartagena, Colombia, in April, the military said on Friday. The soldiers are among 12 service members who brought prostitutes to hotel rooms just prior to a visit by President Barack Obama to the city for the Summit of the Americas. All three soldiers received letters of reprimand for their actions, U.S. Southern Command said. One was ordered to forfeit half his base salary for two months. The other two were given 45 days of extra duties and must forfeit their base salaries for two months. The soldiers were not identified. Previously, four other soldiers and two Marines received similar non-judicial punishments. A member of the Air Force got a letter of reprimand. Two members of the Navy refused non-judicial punishment and are awaiting court-martial, Southern Command said. Thirteen Secret Service agents were implicated in the scandal that rocked the agency responsible for guarding the president. Most resigned or retired and three were cleared of serious misconduct. Three Drug Enforcement Administration agents also admitted to paying for sexual services in Colombia, according to the Justice Department's inspector general. Prostitution is legal in Colombia. But the news that some Secret Service agents were drinking heavily and taking prostitutes back to their hotel rooms raised security concerns and tarnished the reputation of the agency. An investigation concluded that the scandal did not harm presidential security.","Three soldiers are among 12 service members who brought prostitutes to hotel rooms .

"(CNN) -- Legendary cornerman Angelo Dundee, the man who helped motivate Muhammad Ali and many other boxing champs, died Wednesday, a source close to Ali said. He was 90. Dundee died Wednesday in Florida from natural causes, Dundee's son Jimmy Dundee told CNN affiliate WFTS. Dundee, known for being a supreme motivator, was inducted in the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1992. His biography on its website reads like a who's who list of boxing royalty. He was hired to be Ali's trainer and cornerman in 1960 back when the brash-talking, quick-jabbing boxer went by the name Cassius Clay. Dundee was there through Ali's historic name change, his brawls with George Foreman, ""Smokin"" Joe Frazier, Ken Norton and Leon Spinks. He was there all the way toward the end of Ali's career in his punishing loss to Larry Holmes in 1980. After watching Ali get battered for round after round, Dundee stopped the fight after the 10th round fighting off objections from others in the corner and the bruised and puffy-eyed Ali. Loquacious sports analyst Howard Cosell described the scene in the corner this way. ""This fight should be stopped. Angelo is telling the referee to stop it. He would not give in. Angelo Dundee. He cared about his fighter too much."" Dundee was also in the corner of Sugar Ray Leonard giving sage advice during some of Leonard's most memorable fights. During Leonard's 1981 battle with Tommy Hearns, Dundee uttered the emphatic phrase that some say spurred the listless boxer to a dramatic comeback. Sensing that Leonard was behind on the judge's scorecards before the 13th round, Dundee leaned close to Leonard and said in a fatherly tone: ""You're blowing it now son! You're blowing it."" Leonard snapped out of it and knocked Hearns out in the 14th round to gain another welterweight championship. Dundee started his career training Hall Fame boxer Carmen Basilio and also trained champs Jimmy Ellis, Luis Rodriguez, Sugar Ramos, Ralph Dupas and Willie Pastrano. ""Dad lived a great life, and he did a great job living it,"" Jimmy Dundee told WFTS.","Dundee was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1992 .

"(CNN) -- Mike Rowe says he didn't consciously seek a cause to support -- it found him. For eight seasons and in more than 300 episodes, the host of the Discovery Channel's ""Dirty Jobs"" met hard-working Americans doing work that no one else would do. But these were all jobs that help make the world go round. The show, inspired by Rowe's grandfather, a plumber, aimed to celebrate the men and women in trade jobs. But in 2008, the TV show host became in demand as a spokesman on employment issues. ""The economy went sideways, and suddenly I found myself in this weird position of being associated with hundreds of jobs in all different types of work,"" says Rowe, who will host the upcoming CNN series ""Somebody's Gotta Do It."" ""So reporters started calling me to get my opinion on things like the widening skills gap and crumbling infrastructure and currency evaluation and outsourcing and all sorts of stuff I'm not really qualified to talk about, but because I was in that space, I had kind of an interesting perspective, and I started to say things along the line of you know I know unemployment is headline news, but everywhere I was going on 'Dirty Jobs,' I saw help-wanted signs."" Rowe says the folks featured on his show were telling him the same thing. ""They all said how hard it was to find people who were willing to retool, retrain, learn a truly useful skill and apply it,"" he says. Rowe says he realized his mission was to bring attention to this disconnect and get people talking about the skills gap. And so he created a foundation called Mike Rowe Works. ""Mike Rowe Works evolved to shine a light on a lot of jobs that for whatever reason were going unloved. Welders, steamfitters, pipe fitters. The building trades. ... And so it began as kind of a PR campaign for hard work and skilled labor,"" he says. ""I challenged the fans to help build a trade resource center online, and they sent thousands of links to these apprenticeship programs and scholarships and on-the-job training opportunities. So all of that came together, that worked."" Rowe's foundation awards what he calls ""work-ethic scholarships."" ""This is money for kids who are willing to learn a truly useful skill. Get up early, stay late, work their butts off. You know? So Mike Rowe Works wants to reward the place where we think all success starts -- work ethic. So that's our scholarship plan,"" he says. Beyond scholarships, Rowe says he wants to take the stigma out of trade jobs and schools. He says people need to change their attitudes about what comes after high school. As a youth, his guidance counselor warned him not to waste his time on a two-year school after graduation because it was beneath his ""potential,"" he says. The counselor ""went on to show me this poster. This crazy poster in his office. Two guys. A recent graduate holding his degree and looking very happy and optimistic next to a mechanic, head down, covered in grease. And the caption (said), 'Work smart, not hard,' "" Rowe recalls. ""We've had this false choice, you know, this idea that those careers are (for) people who really aren't cut out for college. This implicit suggestion that they're subordinate; well it's not a mystery that today it's those very careers that are lacking. You know (we) need people in those careers. That's where the opportunities are,"" he says. Rowe says attitudes toward employment and education must catch up with the times. ""We're still saying things like work smart, not hard. Go get your four-year degree, trillion dollars in student loans, lending money we don't have to kids who can't pay it back, educating them for jobs that don't really exist anymore, it's all twisted up."" He says he's not against college degrees or academic approaches, but he wants people to know they aren't the only way -- all avenues should be championed that can lead to success. Rowe is out on the road on what he calls ""a PR campaign for hard work,"" bringing his message to anyone who will listen. He talks with fans through social media and meets with government officials, even taking his views all the way to Capitol Hill. ""We need to promote an ethic of work. And there's no way one guy or one company is going to be able to do it. It has to be a big hot mess -- public, private, government, NGOs and smart alecks on the TV talking about it.""","Ex-""Dirty Jobs"" host says he set up foundation to promote hard work .

"(CNN) -- [CAUTION: If you're not caught up on ""Homeland,"" stop reading now! Minor season four spoilers also follow.] . How does one pick up the pieces after one of your main characters has been hanged? That's a question that ""Homeland"" will attempt to answer on Sunday's fourth season premiere. The show returns after a season which saw the excruciating death of Brody, Carrie's lover and the father of her child (and once a U.S. congressman and terrorist). It ended poignantly, as Carrie added a CIA star to mark the life he gave ultimately for his country. The first season of ""Homeland"" was nothing short of a masterpiece, many critics agreed, and it won award after award. But some fans have complained that the show has since started to slip. The third season, critics thought, did not live up to its potential. The New York Times said it found the third season ""more baroque and much less compelling than the first two."" There were episodes devoted to Brody's daughter, which some found grating, and a twist in which Carrie pretended to go off the rails and was sent to a mental facility -- all as part of a plan devised by her and another character, Saul. It just seemed like ""Homeland"" was not what it once was. This season is for all intents and purposes, a reboot. Carrie has had her baby (which she almost gave up for adoption), but she's back in the field, in Afghanistan. The new season begins as she's engineered a drone strike, but all doesn't exactly go as planned. Peter Quinn has a bigger role now, as the leading man of the show. And fan favorite Saul is back, but things aren't exactly going better with his wife, who moved on (so to speak) without his knowledge. Viewers will get plenty of opportunity to decide whether they're on board with the new season, as Showtime will premiere back-to-back new episodes on Sunday night. Will you tune in for season four?","'Homeland' returns after a critically-maligned third season .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Cairo's main square Saturday overflowed with people angry that six former government aides were acquitted of charges of killing hundreds of pro-democracy protesters last year, while former strongman Hosni Mubarak was ordered to prison. Mubarak and former Interior Minister Habib El Adly were sentenced to life in prison for their crimes. Mubarak was immediately transferred to a prison in southern Cairo to serve his sentence, and a prosecutor said the former president, who attended court on a gurney, would be transferred to the prison hospital. Protesters in the square, the center of last year's protests, waved Egyptian flags as they demanded justice for those killed and injured during last year's demonstrations. At least 61 people were injured Saturday in protests throughout Egypt, following the verdict, state TV reported. ""How is (Mubarak) imprisoned for life ... but his main aides are set free?"" asked AbdulMawgoud Dardery, a member of the Freedom and Justice Party, which is part of the Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's largest and oldest opposition group. ""That is a big insult to Egyptian will,"" Dardery told CNN. The Islamist group Muslim Brotherhood is fielding one of two candidates in this month's presidential runoff. Mohamed Morsi is facing secularist Ahmed Shafik, a former official in Mubarak's regime. Given the anger and perceived injustice at the verdict in the 10-month trial, Dardery said, the outcome will hurt Shafik and anyone associated with the former regime. ""All of Egypt are now rallying behind Dr. Morsi,"" Dardery told CNN. ""We call him the candidate of the revolution because he promised the Egyptians to bring justice to those who killed their sons and daughters."" iReport: Egyptians protest current regime . Speaking to reporters, Morsi later echoed the belief that he is the revolution's candidate and promised to bring those responsible for the deaths to justice. ""In the near future, if I am chosen, I will directly initiate a criminal investigation to identify evidence against those who killed revolutionists, those who caused corruption and those who robbed the nation,"" he said. ""I repeat, I am with the revolution and I will continue to be, even after I become president."" About 840 people died and more than 6,000 others were injured in last year's 18-day uprising, according to Amnesty International. ""I'm asking the help of the people who gather in Tahrir Square to get justice for my son,"" pleaded one woman on the street in Cairo. ""I need justice for my son. My son did not commit any crime. How come the sons of Mubarak are set free?"" The Cairo courtroom erupted in chaos Saturday after the judge convicted Mubarak, 84, and acquitted six of his aides for the killings. Mubarak was cleared of a corruption charge and two of his sons were also set free. It appeared the entire gallery of men dressed in suits began shouting and stood on their chairs chanting that the decision wasn't harsh enough. Fists flew and at least one man suffered a bleeding gash to his chin. ""We want honesty!"" they shouted. ""Revolution till victory!"" The Muslim Brotherhood called for protests in Tahrir Square and vowed to retry the acquitted aids if Morsi is elected. Shafik's side did not immediately comment on the outcome. The former president's lawyer, Fareed El Deeb, said there were many holes in the judge's decision and that he was already preparing to appeal the Mubarak verdict. Protesters at one point burned Shafik campaign posters in the square. And thousands marched through downtown Cairo, calling for a law to bar Shafik from running and carrying posters reading ""Shafik = Mubarak."" A strongman's fall from grace . The echoing cheers outside the police academy where the trial was held turned to angry shouts as people first heard Mubarak's sentence, then heard that all of Mubarak's senior advisers and his two sons were acquitted. The mostly anti-Mubarak crowd threw rocks at police, smashed cars and cursed the ruling military council. The sentence delivered by Judge Ahmed Refaat was the final chapter of Mubarak's iron rule of Egypt that ended in February 2011. He said it offered people relief after living ""in 30 years of dark without any hope."" ""The verdicts are insults to the Egyptian people and the judicial system. It's a festival of innocent verdicts to El Adly's aides who killed and tortured free citizens for years,"" said Rami Shath, a member of the Egyptian Revolution Alliance. Human Rights Watch said the verdict sends a message to Egypt's future leaders that they are not above the law, though it said the acquittals give ""a green light to future police abuse."" Amnesty International described the verdict as ""a significant step towards combating long-standing impunity in Egypt,"" but it, too, said the ruling leaves many waiting for full justice. Arab leaders: Where are they now? David Scheffer, an American lawyer and diplomat who served as the first U.S. ambassador-at-large for war crimes issues, said the trial was significant for the Arab world even if it could have been run better. ""While I want to emphasize the problems with the trial itself, it's also important to recognize that the Egyptian judicial system has held a leader accountable for very serious crimes that occurred during the uprising in Egypt,"" Scheffer told CNN. ""In the very heart of the Arab world, where this has not occurred before in a civilian court, a leader has actually been brought to justice, a leader who has been persent in the courtroom has brought to some level of justice by a domestic court for gross human rights abuses."" Timeline of Mubarak's ascent and fall from power . The White House had no comment on Mubarak's sentencing, while a U.S. State Department official, not authorized to speak on the record, described it as ""a decision made by the Egyptian judiciary according to the Egyptian legal process"" and referred further questions to the Egyptian government. The trial has been a spectacle few Egyptians thought they would see, with Mubarak on the gurney and locked in a defendant's cage. The verdict follows Friday's expiration of a notorious emergency law that was in effect since shortly after Mubarak came to power in October 1981 and gave police sweeping powers. CNN's Saad Abedine, Mohamed Fadel Fahmy and Ben Wedeman contributed to this report.","NEW: The Muslim Brotherhood calls for protests and its candidate vows to continue the revolution .

"(CNN) -- For the budget conscious, the mere mention of skiing in Europe has been known to cause whiplash from people reaching around too quickly for their wallets. Those who keep a close watch on their cash tend to avoid resorts that charge the equivalent of a mortgage payment for the privilege of taking a few runs down a mountain and then forking out US$20 for a hot cider afterward. Europe's famed alpine destinations are the worst culprits. Look beyond the pistes of Switzerland, Austria and France, however, and there are bargains to be found across the continent. 7 underrated ski resorts . Soldeu, Andorra . High in the Pyrenees and sandwiched between France and Spain, Andorra is an ideal alternative to the more pricey Alps.Soldeu is the tiny nation's biggest and best resort, with an incredibly cheap weekly pass (US$259), and one-day access costing just US$57. Best of all, the pass covers the wider Grandvalira area, with access to other resorts and an impressive 204 kilometers (126 miles) of runs. The focus is largely on family at this beginner-to-intermediate hill, though there are plenty of lively bars in Soldeu village. The resort is accessible from budget airports at Perpignan in the south of France, and Girona, north of Barcelona. Lift pass: US$259 for five days out of seven; www.soldeu-andorra.com . 7 stunning European ski lodges . Nosal, Zakopane, Poland . In Europe, east means cheap, especially if you're after a European ski holiday. Zakopane best exemplifies Poland's underground reputation as a go-to spot for winter sports. This vast area has a number of different resorts, each offering lift passes for which you need to buy separate tickets. But considering you can take 15 trips on the Nosal resort's lift for just $16, with nearby Gubalowka offering 10 rides from the same amount, it's cheap to hop around and try different slopes. Packages are recommended for this type of trip, as transportation between areas can be tricky without an organized tour. If you want to stick with one place, Nosal is the pick. It has four good beginner runs and a vicious, steep black area for veteran skiers and snowboarders. Best of all, the runs are open from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m., with floodlights fired up after sunset. Lift pass: US$16; www.zakopane-life.com . Cerna Hora, Czech Republic . Cerna Hora is home to the country's longest single run, a two-kilometer monster (1.2 mile) that'll test the hardiest alpine skier. As with most eastern European resorts, the lift pass is an insanely good value. The US$89 three-day pass makes Cerna Hora ideal for weekend trips. Its 14 slopes are reached by the Czech Republic's only eight-person gondola. The area also has 70 kilometers (43 miles) of cross-country routes. What sets Cerna Hora apart is proximity to the spa town of Janské Lázně. With thermal pools and a picturesque town center, it's the ideal place to unwind after a day strapped into your ski boots. Seven-day lift pass: US$162; three-day lift pass for US$89; www.cerna-hora.cz . 10 top ski resorts in Asia . Bansko, Bulgaria . Bulgaria is gaining a reputation as the top destination for skiers desperate for good snow and heaving local bars, but who lack funds to hit the likes of Switzerland and Italy. About 160 kilometers (100 miles) south of the capital of Sofia, and located at the foot of the Pirin Mountains, Bansko is the country's biggest and best resort. It's something of a mission to reach, but worth the effort. The area has been modernized in recent years, with decent hotels and stacks of traditional ""mehana"" for excellent local food, including rich salads, soups, meats and, of course, wine and Bulgarian rakia. The season runs until mid-April, depending on snowfall. Five-day lift pass: US$186; www.banskoski.com . 4 ultra-cool winter activities in the U.S. CairnGorm, Scotland . You may not know it, but the wilds of Scotland have become popular as a skiing destination in recent years. Bitterly cold winters and heavy snowfall mean CairnGorm mountain is buried in snow from December to March. Skiers and boarders hit the slopes between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., light depending, with 30 kilometers (18 miles) of runs, dedicated snowboard park and lots of cross-country trails. Not necessarily great for a weeklong trip, CairnGorm is worth a visit if you're on a city break in Edinburgh and don't mind the two-and-a-half-hour drive north. Geared toward beginners and intermediates, CairnGorm is good if you want to try skiing for the first time or don't fancy the rigmarole of arranging an entire trip based around the slopes and aprés ski excess.

"(CNN) -- If they're going to pull out a victory in the midterm elections, Republicans need to win over women. But they're doing everything in their power to alienate them, from pushing extreme anti-abortion measures that even most Republican voters oppose to blocking equal-pay legislation to, well, just opening their mouths. A leading Republican congressional candidate in Georgia recently said, sure, a woman can run for office if she is ""within the authority of her husband."" A report actually commissioned by Republican groups and reported in Politico found that women view the party as ""intolerant"" and ""stuck in the past."" The report found that women are ""barely receptive"" to GOP policies. In other words, Republicans are losing female voters faster than their anti-contraception policies can produce them. What are Republicans to do? The Republican Party seems reluctant to change its actual policies to support women's economic and reproductive choices and, ya know, generally acknowledge the realities of modern liberated women. So instead, several Republican candidates are coming out against domestic violence in an attempt to seem sensitive to us girls and our issues. That should do the trick, right? ""My ex-husband beat me with a baseball bat, threw me in a garbage can filled with snow and left me in a frozen storage locker to die,"" a woman says, looking straight at the camera, in one such ad for Scott Walker, the Republican governor of Wisconsin. ""At that time, I was pregnant, and I lost the child I was carrying. But I fought to stay alive for my other two children, and today I am fighting for Scott Walker."" Similar ads have been run by Steve Daines, Republican Senate candidate in Montana, and Scott Brown, Republican Senate candidate in New Hampshire. There's just one problem: All the rhetoric in the world doesn't make up for Republicans opposing and obstructing pro-women policies. It's not just the repeated attempts to crush reproductive freedom and block equal-pay legislation; Republicans also opposed the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. That's the law that was actually supposed to do something about domestic violence, a law that Republicans blocked for over a year before finally caving and allowing it to pass. Republicans objected to provisions in the bill that would expand domestic violence protections for Native Americans and gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender Americans; they even tried to pass their own version of the bill with these protections stripped out. Ultimately, after a year of obstructionism, Republicans allowed the more expansive and bipartisan Senate version of the act to come up for a vote in the House -- and even then, a majority of Republicans voted against the measure. Fast-forward to election season. Florida Republican Steve Southerland has one of the toughest re-election fights in the country. In the House, Southerland voted against the expanded version of the Violence Against Women Act, the version that ultimately passed, but voted for the narrow Republican version that didn't pass. Now, Southerland is running an ad featuring a survivor of domestic violence who says, ""Our congressman, Steve, is advocating for things like (the) Violence Against Women Act."" Well, kinda sorta but not really, Steve. Southerland's opponent, Gwen Graham, had her response ad up within 24 hours, accusing Southerland of ""saying one thing in TV ads, doing the opposite in Congress."" Which basically sums up all the attempts of Republicans to appeal to female voters on rhetoric but abandon them on policy. And to be clear, equal pay and reproductive freedom are also key to preventing domestic violence. As the National Network to End Domestic Violence writes, ""Like all women, survivors of domestic violence need equal pay initiatives like the Paycheck Fairness Act. As long as women are paid less than men, most survivors will have less ability to gain financial stability and independence."" Many of these women are low-wage workers, who would also be helped by raising the minimum wage. And a new study this week finds (PDF) that as many as one in four women who seek an abortion experience violence from an intimate partner. Women often say one primary reason for seeking an abortion is to avoid exposing their children to domestic violence. Another reason: They don't want to remain tied to an abusive partner. According to this long-term study, when these women are able to access abortion services, their odds of being abused decrease by 7% each month after -- while women who can't get an abortion see their rates of domestic violence remain the same or even increase. Reproductive choice, including abortion rights, and wage equity, including raising the minimum wage and passing gender-equity legislation, are key not only for all women and their families but for victims and survivors of domestic violence, for whom economic and reproductive freedom translates directly into freedom from abuse. The Republican Party has do more than just talk about domestic violence and women's opportunity and actually support the real policies that support women's freedom and choices -- or otherwise, women will keep choosing to vote for Democrats.","Sally Kohn: GOP needs to win female voters, but its policies are just alienating them .

"Las Vegas, Nevada (CNN) -- It's not just t-t-t-telephones for Lady Gaga. The mega-famous pop star came to the Consumer Electronics Show on Thursday to announce a new line of cameras and photo printers with Polaroid, where she is officially the ""creative director."" Polaroid ""really let me put my hands in there and design this s--- myself,"" she said. Polaroid's Grey Label product line, which isn't available yet, will feature sunglasses with a camera embedded in them, a camera that shoots digital and Polaroid images and a portable photo printer that Gaga says she takes to bars with her -- in her purse. ""I suppose many of you are nerdy enough to carry around a mobile printer,"" she said, acknowledging the technophiles in attendance. ""I know I will."" Wearing sunglasses, a black dress and a dark veil, Gaga looked somewhat like Jackie O at a funeral as she took a picture of the audience and printed it on the new Polaroid printer, which creates 3-by-4-inch images that look like classic Polaroids. Video: Watch Lady Gaga introduce camera-equipped sunglasses . ""Smile! You're so f---ing famous!"" she said, snapping the shot. ""Oh no, wait, I just took a photo of Canon. Let me go back."" The presentation took place at Polaroid's booth on the trade show floor at CES. Canon -- a competitor -- had a booth and large ads set up within view. The Polaroid GL20 image-capturing sunglasses, which are a protoype, store photos on a chip in the earpiece of the glasses. Lady Gaga said she had a heavy hand in designing the frames, which sat on a gold mannequin during the short presentation. The over-size glasses covered a good half of the mannequin's face, coming almost down to its lips. ""You can come to one of my shows and wear them,"" she said. ""Take pictures of me dancing on stage."" The GL10 printer, available for $150 in March, connects to phones via Bluetooth, allowing for on-the-go prints. (It doesn't work yet for the iPhone, a fact that, when revealed by Gaga, got boos and cheers from the audience). What CES devices interest you the most? Share your thoughts . The GL30 camera, which will be out by the holiday season, takes both digital and Polaroid prints. A future version will connect to the internet so the shots can be uploaded to social media sites. This version does not, she said. ""I think it's sexy, it's sleek and it's hearty,"" she said. ""It's not heavy but it feels good in your hand."" In working on the Gray Label line, Lady Gaga said Polaroid asked her what she thought the camera of the future would be. ""This is!"" she recalls responding, holding up her BlackBerry. The new printer is intended to cater to this cell-phone-photo crowd. But many websites and apps now convert smartphone photos with filters, making them look like old-school Polaroids or like they've been taken with toy cameras. Those can be printed on any other available photo printer, although not always on-the-go. Some techie attendees at CES waited more than an hour to see Lady Gaga's announcement, and at least a few started to grow restless when she took the stage more than 40 minutes late. While some of them booed the empty stage, others stood anxiously, holding their cell phone-cameras in the air for minutes at a time. But Gaga wasn't first to take the stage. That was Polaroid Chairman Bobby Sager, who was greeted by boos from the audience. He didn't seem to mind. ""This will be very quick because I know you don't want to listen to me,"" he said.","New line includes camera in a pair of sunglasses .

"Washington (CNN) -- What do tea party aligned Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Democratic Rep. Jim McDermott of Washington state have in common? Not a whole lot. But they are traveling to South Africa together to attend Nelson Mandela's memorial service. The December 10 service at the Johannesburg soccer stadium will feature U.S. political luminaries, including President Barack Obama and former Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton. Cruz's office did not indicate the freshman Senator has any connection to Mandela, but Cruz said in a statement that he was ""honored"" to be able to attend the event. Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, congressional Democrats to commemorate Mandela in South Africa . Cruz is the only senator on the taxpayer-funded trip. He is with 22 members of Congress, mostly from the Congressional Black Caucus, which organized the trip that House Speaker John Boehner authorized. On the 20-hour flight, Cruz could sit near the only other Republican to attend, Rep. Aaron Schock of Illinois. Schock said he was ""humbled"" to be asked by Boehner to lead the delegation and represent House Republicans. Or Cruz could sit near civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis of Georgia and other members of the CBC, who tend to have more liberal political leanings. Secret Service prepares for Obama's last-minute trip to South Africa . Cruz seems like the odd person out. The 42-year-old freshman firebrand has made a name for himself in the Senate, most recently for his filibuster to defund the Affordable Care Act. Don Stewart, a spokesman for Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, said the House-organized trip was ""opened to the Senate."" ""We notified all Senate offices of the quick availability. Senator Cruz requested to go on the trip,"" Stewart said. When Cruz posted a note of condolence on his Facebook page last week, saying Mandela ""will live in history as an inspiration for defenders of liberty around the globe,"" angry commenters blasted him for praising the South African leader, who died last week at 95. Seliqua Bodina wrote, ""Wow you stepped in it this time."" And Dan Noxon said, ""Why don't all you Mandela lovers head on over to South Africa and see what's going on now that 'Mandela's people' have control of the nation .... get out and mix with the people, experience what life is really like. Especially if you're white."" Told about Cruz's trip, Republican strategist, John Feehery, said he was ""speechless."" But then he said, ""Good for him."" ""Sometimes the best way to be a profile in courage is by taking on the nut jobs,"" Feehery said, referring to the ugly comments Cruz got last week. Considered a potential 2016 presidential candidate, Cruz could benefit politically from the trip. Feehery said there is very little political risk in going and possibly a lot to gain. ""You look like a statesman; you make invaluable contacts, since every important person in the world is going to be there,"" Feehery said. A politically and personally challenging moment for Cruz could be when Cuban President Raul Castro speaks at the service. Cruz's dad is from Cuba but fled at the age of 18 and Cruz is a vocal critic of the Castro regime, especially of former President Fidel Castro. On Mandela, Cruz said, ""He nobly chose reconciliation instead of retribution -- a legacy for which he will be remembered forever.""","Sen.

"Las Vegas, Nevada (CNN)  -- AT&T, which has been late to the 4G race, announced detailed plans for its faster, fourth-generation network on Wednesday while showing its first 4G smartphones. The carrier has begun upgrading its network to a protocol with the awkward name of HSPA+ and that is faster than today's 3G. That process will ramp up this year, said AT&T executives at a developers conference here during the Consumer Electronics Show. During the second half of the year, AT&T plans to begin rolling out a more advanced technology called Long-Term Evolution (LTE), which is very similar to the 4G network Verizon Wireless launched late last year. Both protocols are expected to allow smartphone users to upload and download mobile Web data faster than current 3G networks. Executives for AT&T, the second-largest U.S. carrier by subscribers, were careful to distinguish between the two infrastructures because they believe that having both provides a technical edge. T-Mobile USA, which claims to have the nation's largest 4G network, has only deployed HSPA+. Verizon skipped over that technology in favor of the faster LTE. And Sprint Nextel uses something entirely different. AT&T says having both technologies in place lets users, when out of range of an LTE 4G network, fall back on the still-fast HSPA+. AT&T Mobility CEO Ralph de la Vega boasted that as ""something our competitors will not be able to match."" Yet, in an identity crisis that seems to plague the wireless industry, AT&T Marketing Chief David Christopher blurred the lines during his speech. Phones carrying the moniker ""4G"" will have only the soon-to-be-dated HSPA+. Christopher said the carrier's ""blockbuster lineup of 4G tablets"" will be led by a touchscreen computer with HSPA+ from Samsung Electronics, which will come out in the spring or summer. A tablet with the faster LTE chip will debut in the second half of the year, he said. Unlike competitors, AT&T says it's upgrading cellular sites that receive the most demand, rather than focusing on rollouts in entire cities. The other three major carriers launched 4G networks in piecemeal -- first rolling out the network, along with 4G laptop cards, and then releasing smartphones for them. Sprint and T-Mobile were without phones to take advantage of their speedier networks for months. Verizon has yet to unveil its 4G phones, but the company is expected to do so on Thursday. AT&T plans to release 20 devices with 4G, starting with HSPA+ phones in the next few months. LTE phones will come in the latter half of the year, around the same time as the launch of that network. Smartphone manufacturers Motorola Mobility, HTC and Samsung joined AT&T on the stage Wednesday to show their first few 4G phones for AT&T. ""AT&T is moving ahead so quickly with their 4G rollout, and we are part of that,"" said HTC CEO Peter Chou at the event. ""In this era of breakneck technology change, many people want more."" J.K. Shin, Samsung's mobile president, says the company will add another phone, called the Infuse 4G, to its Galaxy S lineup. The Android smartphone is very thin and has a 4.5-inch touchscreen -- larger than most rival models. It will also have an 8-megapixel camera on the back and another on the front. Motorola's Atrix 4G phone will have a sure-to-be-fast dual-core processor inside, allowing it to pump out 1080p high-definition video through an HDMI port.","AT&T announces detailed plans for its faster, fourth-generation network at CES .

"San Francisco (CNN) -- In the world of gaming, money doesn't necessarily buy respect. Online games designed to be played on Facebook, called ""social games"" in industry jargon, have multiplied in the last few years, since the world's largest social network introduced a Web platform for friend-enhanced applications. But even at a time when Zynga Game Network, which makes the wildly popular ""FarmVille,"" is valued higher than software giant Electronic Arts, social games don't have much street cred among hard-core gamers or industry veterans. A clearer picture of these dynamics emerged at last week's Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, where CNN attended panels and interviewed designers and programmers. In the natural pecking order of game-making, visionaries like Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto can attract followers that hang on his every word. But at the opposite end, creators of social games struggle to legitimize their work among their peers. This theme was pervasive enough to warrant its own panel at GDC. The hour-plus discussion was titled ""No Freaking Respect! Social Game Developers Rant Back,"" and it attracted a large audience. Scott Jon Siegel, a lead designer for Playdom, Disney's social-game division, spent his time onstage feeding many of the stereotypes. Something changed two years ago that formed a storm cloud over the land of Facebook games, he said. ""One game changed the entire games industry,"" Siegel said, standing in front of a silhouette of a cartoon farmer. ""And this game is 'Farm Town.' "" ""Farm Town"" was a precursor to the more popular ""FarmVille"" from Zynga. These games earn revenue by encouraging players to click on advertisements, or through micro-payments, in which players cough up real money in exchange for virtual goods, such as barns or livestock. ""This formula instills bad habits,"" Siegel said. ""You're doing 'making lots of money' right. You're doing 'engaging lots of users' right,"" he said, addressing developers. ""You're not making good games."" Playdom introduced two new Facebook games during GDC. The company plans to release ""Deep Realms"" -- a story-driven, role-playing game set in a medieval town -- on March 21. About a week later, Playdom intends to debut a puzzle game called ""Gardens of Time."" One part is a ""hidden object"" scavenger hunt, and another is a new take on those popular games in magazines or on bar machines that present two seemingly identical pictures and ask people to spot the differences between them. Eric Todd, the game's creative director, said he put a lot of thought into themes for his game's story, which involves members of an organization tasked with protecting the flow of time. Before Playdom, Todd worked on the complex computer game ""Spore,"" in which players populate a new world with creatures they create. Mark Pincus, Zynga's CEO and therefore the veritable king of social gaming, didn't attend his company's GDC party or appear on any panels. Instead he dispatched chief designer Brian Reynolds, who defended his company's work, saying that Zynga's games -- most recently, ""FarmVille"" spinoffs such as ""FrontierVille"" and ""CityVille"" -- help people keep in touch with friends. But that didn't stop other GDC attendees from criticizing the social-games trend. Nintendo President Satoru Iwata, in his keynote speech, commended competitors in the console arena but had no kind words for gaming on smartphones or social networks. Even so, rival Konami, a major Japanese console game company, is moving quickly to add social networking features. And two news media empires are making aggressive plays in the social-game space. News Corp., which owns Fox, and DMGT, which owns several big UK sites, recently created divisions for publishing Facebook games. Gaming has outpaced other categories in its successful adoption of social networks, said Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg during an October announcement of his support for a venture capital fund dedicated to social apps. ""The games and stuff that have happened on this platform are just amazing. Zynga is a great example of this,"" Zuckerberg said. ""Five years out, I think the world is going to look a lot more like Zynga."" For developers of social games, the challenge now is convincing skeptics that becoming Zynga is an honorable goal.","Facebook game developers say they're sometimes put at the bottom of the pecking order .
That's despite the fact that social-game business is very profitable .
Some critics consider social games money-driven rather than artistic ."
"(CNN) -- I'm looking forward to Thursday night's installment of CNN's ""The Sixties"" with some trepidation. True, it's another excellent installment in the series. Capturing the highlights and essence of a decade, especially one as turbulent and historically significant as the '60s, is not easy. Given the controversial nature of many of the events -- at the time and even today -- and given how much influence some of those movements and events still exert, the task of putting together even a multipart series is daunting. Thursday's episode will cover the 1968 assassinations of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., on April 4, and of Bobby Kennedy, on June 5. Other episodes will cover the beginnings of the gay rights movement -- the Stonewall riots -- and the emergence of the women's rights movement. Those events changed my life, immediately. Those movements changed the way I saw the world, eventually. I was born on December 15, 1959 -- the cusp of the '60s. As the baby boomers came of age, or at least entered their teens, I went from infancy, to being a toddler, to childhood. I have no direct memories of the Cuban Missile Crisis, JFK's assassination, the Beatles coming to America, or the buildup of the Vietnam War. ""I Have A Dream"" was my dream -- it still is, of course -- but I learned the words in reruns. But I was old enough to be affected directly by the events in this episode. As I wrote in ""Cooking With Grease,"" I grew up on April 4, 1968, when Martin Luther King was shot. I'd been active in neighborhood politics even before, but that night, at 9 years old, I joined the civil rights movement. I had no choice. None of us did. When Bobby Kennedy was assassinated two months later, we prayed. I remember praying. I remember my anger, my fear, my determination. I remember talking to everyone I trusted, everyone I thought wise. The times indeed were changing, but nobody knew what they were changing into. Our challenge was channeling anger into action, transforming despair into determination, using defeat to become more disciplined. I learned early it's a lifetime challenge. While the civil rights movement was woven into my childhood, it took a bit longer for me to become aware of what was then called the women's liberation movement. Of course, the fight for equality goes back into the 19th century, even to Founders like Abigail Adams. But it was in 1968 that ""women's lib"" became an official part of the societal shift, the tide of change toward economic, social and legal equality. (The name ""women's liberation"" came from a nationally circulated newsletter that came out of Chicago.) It was a time of consciousness-raising, and women refused to be left out. In 1968, 100 women protested the Miss America beauty pageant. In 1972, Gloria Steinem published the first issue of Ms. Magazine, but the seeds had been sown earlier. Women like Steinem, Bella Abzug, Shirley Chisholm, Betty Friedan, Barbara Jordan -- they showed a young girl just entering her teens that being a woman wasn't a political handicap, but an asset. Or it could be. The gay rights movement also started in the late '60s, but it had the farthest to go. Like the push for women's equality, it actually started earlier. It just found its voice, following the footsteps of the civil rights and women's rights movements. The impetus was the Stonewall riots. When police raided the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village on June 28, 1969, it sent shock waves through the gay and lesbian community. Police lost control of the situation, people rioted, and more protests occurred the next night, and again on other nights. Village residents began organizing, trying to establish places where gays and lesbians could be open without harassment or arrest. Organizing nationwide was slow. Gaining acceptance by other activist groups was slow. Getting respect and equal treatment before the law was slow. It still is. But where we are today began then. And if we want to have an honest discussion about where we are, and where we can and should go, we need to understand the '60s a lot better than we do. I hope you'll tune in.","Events in ""The Sixties"" changed the world and the way Donna Brazile saw it .

"(CNN) -- Like a momentary glitch on a flat-panel display, the attacks by hackers calling themselves ""Anonymous"" came and went. Visa, PayPal, MasterCard and Amazon report no significant damage, and business goes on as usual. The corporations acting to cut off WikiLeaks remain safe. Although many are unsettled by the thought of a site such as WikiLeaks revealing state secrets or a group of anonymous hackers breaking the security of the banking system, events of the past week reveal that such threats are vastly overstated. If anything, the current debacle demonstrates just how tightly controlled the net remains in its current form, as well as just what would have to be done to create the sort of peer-to-peer network capable of upending corporate and government power over mass communication and society itself. While in the short term, WikiLeaks managed to create a public platform for a massive number of classified cables, the site itself was rather handily snuffed out by the people actually in charge of the internet. That's because however decentralized the net might feel when we are posting to our blogs, it was actually designed around highly centralized indexes called domain name servers. Every time we instruct our browsers to find a web page, they ping one of these authorized master lists in order to know where to go. Removing WikiLeaks or any other site, group, top-level domain or entire nation is as easy as deleting it from that list. The durability of WikiLeaks' disclosures rests less in the willingness of many rogue websites to attempt to host them in WikiLeaks' stead than in the sanctity of traditional news outlets such as The New York Times and Guardian of London, which were also sent the complete package of classified documents and can't be turned off with the online equivalent of a light switch. Likewise, the server space on which our websites appear is owned by corporations that have the power -- if not the true right -- to cut anyone off for any reason they choose. It's private property, after all. Similarly, our means of funding WikiLeaks is limited to companies such as Visa and PayPal, which immediately granted government requests to freeze payments and donations to WikiLeaks. It's the same way a rogue nation's assets can be frozen by the banks holding them. Hackers, angered at this affront to the supposed openness of the internet, then went on the attack. They used their own computers -- as well as servers they had been able to commandeer -- to wage ""denial of service"" attacks on the websites of the offending companies. Most of those companies, already armed with defensive capabilities designed to fend off intrusions from the likes of the Russian mob or the Red Army, survived unscathed. Only MasterCard was noticeably, if only temporarily, disrupted. Meanwhile, Facebook and Twitter quickly disabled accounts traced to those using the services to organize their minions. And all this tamping down occurred on today's purportedly ""net neutral"" internet, which offers no real advantage to one corporate-owned server over any other. We can only imagine the effect of these events on those who will decide on whether to maintain net neutrality or give in to the corporations that argue the internet's distributive capabilities should be reserved for those who can pay for such distribution, by the byte. No, the real lesson of the WikiLeaks affair and subsequent cyberattacks is not how unwieldy the net has become, but rather how its current architecture renders it so susceptible to control from above. It was in one of the leaked cables that China's State Council Information office delivered its confident assessment that thanks to ""increased controls and surveillance, like real-name registration ... The Web is fundamentally controllable."" The internet's failings as a truly decentralized network, however, merely point the way toward what a decentralized network might actually look like. Instead of being administrated by central servers, it would operate through computers that pinged one another, instead of corporate-owned server farms, and deliver web pages from anywhere, even our own computers. The FCC and other governing bodies may attempt to defang the threat of the original internet by ending net neutrality. But if they did, such a new network -- a second, ""people's internet"" -- would almost certainly rise in its place. In the meantime, the internet we know, love and occasionally fear today is more of a beta version of modeling platform than a revolutionary force. And like any new model, it changes the way we think of the way things work right now. What the internet lacks today indicates the possibilities for what can only be understood as a new operating system: a 21st century, decentralized way of conducting political, commercial and human affairs. This new operating system, even in its current form, is slowly becoming incompatible with the great, highly centralized institutions of the 20th century, such as central banking and nation states, which still depend on top-down control and artificial monopolies on power to maintain their authority over business and governance. The ease with which PayPal or Visa can cut off the intended recipient of our funds, for example, points the way to peer-to-peer transactions and even currencies that allow for the creation and transmission of value outside the traditional banking system. The ease with which a senator's phone call can shut down a web site leads network architects to evaluate new methods of information distribution that don't depend on corporate or government domain management for their effectiveness. Until then, at the very least, the institutions still wielding power over the way our networks work and don't work have to exercise their power under a new constraint: They must do so in the light of day. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Douglas Rushkoff.","Douglas Rushkoff: Attacks on companies that thwarted WikiLeaks did little damage .

"Abuja, Nigeria (CNN) -- My friend's eight-year-old daughter burst into tears while watching a Boko Haram video release on TV the other evening. The terrorist group has been receiving the kind of local and international media coverage that could make even a Hollywood megastar explode with envy. At the current rate, the group's leader, Abubakar Shekau, might as well be given his own reality show. I understand the reporting of a bomb blast: the need to let the world know about 234 missing school girls is obvious. Updating us on the world's efforts to rescue the abducted girls definitely makes sense. But why should law-abiding citizens be bombarded with the megalomaniac audio and video rantings of every Shekau recording forwarded to the press? As news organizations around the world scrambled to make amends for their belated coverage of the kidnapped school girls, Boko Haram contributed to the media frenzy by releasing a video in which Shekau boasted that he would sell the girls for the equivalent of $12 each. Since then, many of us have had to endure, from local and international media, several replays of the villain's Idi Aminesque gloating into the camera. The group's earlier video released days after the bombing of a bus park in an Abuja suburb (which took place a few hours before the abductions) featured Shekau barking bombastic statements such as: ""We are in your city but you don't know where we are"", ""(President) Jonathan, you are now too small for us. We can only deal with your grand masters like Obama, the president of America ... even they cannot do anything to us ... we are more than them,"" and ""So, because of that tiny incident that happened in Abuja, everybody is out there making an issue of it across the globe?"" These taunts and other details of the video were broadly reported by international news organizations, even at a time the world was paying little attention to the missing girls -- when Nigerians were yet to know exactly how many students had been abducted, their names, and what they and their families looked like. The media has also been sophisticating its coverage of Boko Haram's activities. What looks to me like the effort of steamy thugs to stock up on females to meet their physiological and domestic needs -- while grabbing major headlines in the process -- has been glamorised as ""an attack on the right of girls to education."" Additional reports that more girls were stolen from their homes -- not school, this time -- in Warabe and Wala villages of Bornu State, should have caused the media to finally acknowledge the abductions for the common criminality that they really are. Besides, anyone following the news closely might have heard that these abductions of females have been carrying on for quite some time, though never on the scale that has recently shocked the world. Opinion: How Islam can fight back against Boko Haram . Similarly glamorous motives were ascribed to Boko Haram's bombing of two newspaper offices in Nigeria. Headlines described the April 2012 incident as ""an attack on freedom of the press."" However, Shekau's video release, which followed soon after, gave his actual, rather primitive reasons: ""...Each time we say something, it is either changed or downplayed...I challenge every Nigerian to watch that video again. There is no place our imam either said he will crush President Jonathan or issued an ultimatum to the government in Nigeria, but nearly all papers carried very wrong and mischievous headlines."" I can imagine the AK47-clad hoodlums scrambling to Google after each fresh aggression, frantically typing their leader's name and some relevant key words. There was nothing complex about the group's motives: The newspaper office bombings were a mere act of raw revenge. Boko Haram is probably just a gang of plundering hoods masquerading as a group with higher motives that could warrant dialogue -- never mind that they may have attracted the alliance of more sinister sponsors with more strategic purposes. The group claims ""Western education is a sin"" yet records its threats with hi-tech video equipment and employs advanced ammunition to destroy; it has no clear target and attacks willy-nilly, a la Wild Wild West; and its conduct is as Islamic as that of the street preacher who kidnapped and raped Elizabeth Smart was Christian. The media and expert analysts are the ones who seem to be supplying Boko Haram with all the grand motives they may never really have thought about in the first place. As an author, who has had expert reviewers dissect my book and ascribe to my writing various meanings of which I had absolutely no idea, I am quite familiar with how something straightforward can suddenly be accorded impressive complexity. We may not be able to take the guns and bombs out of the hands of Boko Haram and their ilk yet, but since they are not content to take full advantage of Instagram or Facebook -- as many other attention-seekers of this age are -- the media must stop fuelling their inner psychopaths. If they won't travel to Hollywood and patiently wait tables until they get noticed by Quentin Tarantino, we must not offer them stardom on a platter. There has to be a better way of passing on the relevant information and awareness of danger about terrorists to the public, without creating superstar monsters.","Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani: Why must citizens be bombarded with Boko Haram ""rantings""

"(CNN) -- The Aflac duck lost its voice Monday after the insurance giant fired the comedian behind the commercial quack for tweeting jokes about the earthquake and tsunami that have devastated Japan. The Columbus, Georgia-based company fired Gilbert Gottfried less than an hour after discovering the tweets, according to a news release from Aflac. ""Gilbert's recent comments about the crisis in Japan were lacking in humor and certainly do not represent the thoughts and feelings of anyone at Aflac,"" Michael Zuna, the company's senior vice president and chief marketing officer, said in a statement. The earthquake and tsunami have left more than 2,400 people dead and thousands more in shelters or missing. Most of the tweets attributed to Gottfried make light of the natural disaster in either a flippant or a sexual manner. The tweets include this, posted at 12:33 p.m. Saturday: . ""Japan called me. They said 'maybe those jokes are a hit in the U.S., but over here, they're all sinking.' "" Another tweet, posted at 11:06 a.m. the same day, said: . ""I was talking to my Japanese real estate agent. I said 'is there a school in this area.' She said 'not now, but just wait.' "" Zuna said, ""Aflac Japan -- and, by extension, Japan itself -- is part of the Aflac family, and there is no place for anything but compassion and concern during these difficult times."" He added that the company was giving the International Red Cross 100 million yen ($1.2 million) to aid in disaster relief. Zuna also noted that Gottfried had not provided the quack for the Japanese version of the Aflac duck. Gottfried is perhaps best known as a character actor in such Hollywood movies as ""The Adventures of Ford Fairlane,"" ""Problem Child 1 and 2"" and ""House Party 3."" His high-pitched, gravelly voice also provided the dialogue for Iago, the parrot sidekick of an evil sultan's adviser in the Disney cartoon movie ""Aladdin,"" as well as subsequent sequels. He was also a one-season cast member of Saturday Night Live in 1980. Gottfried issued a statement Tuesday apologizing for his ""attempt at humor regarding the tragedy in Japan."" ""I meant no disrespect, and my thoughts are with the victims and their families,"" he said in the statement. Zuna said Aflac ""will immediately set plans in motion to conduct a nationwide casting call to find a new voice of the iconic Aflac Duck.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Just hours after an ISIS spokesman called on the group's foreign fighters to carry out attacks on coalition countries led by the United States in the battle against the terrorist group, a senior Obama administration official warned the international community is not prepared to respond to such threats. ""We're not structured that way effectively right now"" to respond to that kind of call, the official said. President Obama hopes to ""galvanize"" international efforts to deal with the foreign fighter threat during his trip to the United Nations General Assembly in New York this week. ""It sends a very powerful signal that this is an item of the highest urgency,"" said a senior administration official, who described the danger posed by foreign fighters as ""extremely worrying."" The Obama administration is confident a new binding resolution aimed at preventing and tracking the travel of foreign fighters will be adopted at this week's U.N. Security Council meeting. The meeting will be chaired by Obama, marking only the second time he has presided over a Security Council session during his time in office. Nations signing on to the agreement would be bound to new common law enforcement practices, officials said. However, there is no enforcement mechanism to guarantee that countries abide by the resolution. ""I think we are very confident that this will be adopted this week,"" said a senior administration official. Part of the problem with the international response to traveling foreign fighters is the lack of coordinated counterterrorism measures among countries, senior administration officials said. At the moment the U.S. intelligence community believes there are 15,000 foreign fighters from 80 countries who are fighting alongside ISIS and other similar terror groups. Some 2,000 of those fighters are believed to be European. A senior administration official offered some nuanced detail about the 100 Americans who fit into the same foreign fighter category. That official said those 100 Americans are believed to be people who are either on the ground in the region fighting for ISIS or who have already returned to the U.S. and are now under surveillance by law enforcement. The White House is planning an upcoming summit to confront the threat posed by foreign fighters inspired by ISIS, a senior administration official said Monday. The Countering Violent Extremism Summit would take place at the White House, senior administration officials said at a background briefing with reporters. The event is another one of the key deliverables the Obama administration is expecting to nail down at this week's General Assembly.","ISIS has called on its foreign fighters to attack countries that join coalition led by U.S.

"(CNN) -- This has been a banner year for crime novelist Michael Connelly. A film adaptation of ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" was a critical success and could become a TV series next year. His most recent novel, ""The Fifth Witness,"" hit No. 1 on the bestseller list, and Connelly topped 1 million e-books sold online. His latest novel, ""The Drop,"" arrives in bookstores Tuesday and is poised to be another top seller. This is Connelly's 24th novel and the 18th featuring his dogged LAPD detective Harry Bosch. ""The Drop"" finds Bosch fighting off forced retirement, struggling to be a better single father to his teenage daughter and pursuing two mysteries simultaneously. In one, Bosch is called to the famous Chateau Marmont hotel to investigate the death of an L.A. city councilman's son. Did the victim jump, or was he pushed from a hotel window? It's a case fraught with ""high jingo,"" police speak for internal politics. The second mystery comes from the LAPD's ""open-unsolved unit."" In a cold case dating to 1989, Bosch makes a chilling discovery: A serial killer has been operating in L.A. in secret for decades. Unlike Bosch, there's no talk of retirement with Connelly. With 42 million copies of his books sold worldwide, he's just back from a promotional tour in Europe. He's pressing ahead with plans to bring Bosch to the big screen, looking for the right deal and the right people to work with, and working on a TV pilot for ""The Lincoln Lawyer."" He's also preparing to celebrate 20 years as a novelist. CNN recently caught up with Connelly to talk about his new book. The following is an edited transcript. CNN: What was the spark behind your latest book? Connelly: Actually, there were a couple different sparks. The book has two parallel stories going through it. One I call the political story. In a turnabout, Harry ends up more or less working for a guy who's been his nemesis in other books. That was an idea suggested to me by a cop a long time ago, and I've been holding on to it, carrying it around with me, waiting for the right time to write that story. The other story is Harry on a cold case, inspired by an aspect of L.A.'s ""Grim Sleeper"" case -- not necessarily the investigation of the alleged serial killer but the fact that when they caught the guy they say is the Grim Sleeper, they found thousands of photos and videotapes in his possession of women, many of them potential victims. A squad of detectives has to go to work looking through all these photos every day trying to identify the people, trying to find identifiable characteristics in the pictures. It just seemed like a very difficult task knowing that all these people could have ended up being victims of a pretty bad predator. Just that idea kind of shot through and gave me images, and I knew that was the other prong of the story, that Harry Bosch encounters something like that. CNN: Bosch is dealing with some pretty dark subject matter in this novel. Was that planned? Connelly: You know, I don't really outline my books, so I can't say I knew what was going to happen. I was impressed by this real case, and I wanted to create a case that had that aspect. After I was done writing ""The Drop,"" I looked back at that chapter, and I thought that might be the darkest chapter I've ever written. Who would have seen that coming 10 months ago, when I started writing the book? CNN: How has Harry Bosch changed over the course of your career? Connelly:  I think he's changed a lot. The books take place in real time, so it's more than 18 years of Harry Bosch. Like anybody who's aged 18 years, you're going to be different. A lot of his hard edges have worn down by his experiences. I think his cynicism has been alleviated somewhat by having his daughter in his life in the last couple of books. That's become a very big part of his focus in life. He'd been a father for a long time, but he'd never been engaged in raising her until she was a teenager. He's not that good at it. He's learning as he goes, but what's affecting him is what affects anyone who becomes a parent: You hope for a better world for your children, so that's kind of changed his outlook on the world. CNN: Like Harry Bosch, you too are a father. How does that impact your novels? Connelly: Harry doesn't have the benefit that you and I have of being with our kids from the beginning. Harry's daughter is a year older than mine, so they share a lot of stuff. Sometimes his daughter says stuff that my daughter says, and so forth. But Harry's learning curve is much different from mine. He makes a lot of missteps, and he does a lot of things that might seem odd to other parents, but when you look at his perspective of where he's been in his life, the institutions he's been a part of, they seem quite natural. He takes his daughter shooting. I don't know too many people that would do that. I'm not going to make a judgment on whether it's right or wrong; it's just not the usual type of father-daughter outing. That in a way is an endearing part of their relationship. He wants to pass on some of his skills to her, and he's working on that, and I think you can see that in this book. CNN: Your books always incorporate real Los Angeles landmarks; do you have any favorite spots you've written about? Connelly:  The Chateau Marmont is one of my favorites. I don't live in L.A. anymore, but I'm there a lot, and I stay in various hotels, but I stay there often, in room 79, which is a crime scene in this book. I've stayed there many times. I really like that place. It's got some celebrity cachet, but it's also got this old-world charm. It's a very private place that I really like, so that was kind of fun to write. Some of this book was written in that room. That's always fun when you can do something like that. They knew I was writing the book. They're very nice to me there, and they just said ""treat us with respect."" I do have a crime scene set there, but hopefully my love of the place, its attractiveness, comes out in the book. CNN: You're just back from a book tour in the UK. What was that like? Connelly: The book's just coming out here in the U.S., but it came out in October in Europe. So I was over there promoting the book, and it's not even out here, so it's a little bit unusual. It was fun, good reception, good weather when I was in the UK and Ireland, a fun thing to do. I did a number of events. They were well-attended, and I just heard a couple of days ago the book is No. 1 in Ireland. I'm of Irish descent, so that's always good to hear. CNN: You recently became part of a very exclusive club; your eBooks have sold more than 1 million copies online. How does that feel? Connelly: That was actually shocking when I heard that and the company of authors I'm included with now. I think ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" movie had something to do with it; it's a pretty good movie, and I think that inspired a lot of people to check out the book. That probably pushed me over the top. CNN: Do you have a favorite book this year? Connelly: Two books I read recently, ""The Cut"" by George Pelecanos and ""Feast Day of Fools"" by James Lee Burke, were really outstanding. Also a new book I just read. It's called ""Shortcut Man"" by P.G. Sturges. It's set in L.A., kind of a noir story. His father was a famous screenwriter. CNN: What's next for you? Connelly: Well, you've always got to keep writing, so I'm writing. Next year is kind of a significant year for me. It will be 20 years since my first book came out, so next year, I'll publish my 25th book. I've thought a lot about that and just felt like it should be Harry Bosch. So I'm working on a Harry Bosch book. It's called ""The Black Box."" That's under way, and hopefully it will be out around this time next year.

"Washington (CNN) -- During President Barack Obama's three-day swing through the states of Washington California and Colorado, he fielded questions at a town hall meeting in Silicon Valley and visited a high school in Denver. Two official events to promote his jobs plan. Compare that to seven fundraisers he headlined, raising at least $8 million for his re-election campaign and the Democratic National Committee. Who paid for the trip? You did. And so did we. Taxpayers are footing the bill for almost the entire trip, which also cost millions of dollars. It's standard practice for presidents, both Democratic and Republican, to go on predominantly fundraising trips with taxpayer's paying for most of the travel costs. It's completely legal. Do some official White House business on the trip and -- voila! -- the president's re-election campaign and party shoulder very little of the cost. ""Usually, a political party only covers a fraction of the costs of presidential travel, usually in the single digit percentages,"" says Pete Sepp with the National Taxpayers Union, a nonpartisan nonprofit group against wasteful government spending. ""Most of the money raised really comes at a free cost to the parties. They only reimburse for a few hundred thousand dollars, on a given trip, if tax payers are lucky."" The price tag on presidential travel is exorbitant. Air Force One costs $181,757 per flight hour to operate, according to the Air Force. There's a C-17 military support plane to fly the president's limousines to his destination, perhaps another if Marine One will be used during the trip. And the personnel: the salary costs of a Secret Service detail and dozens of White House staffers who also required meals, transportation and hotel rooms. There are also local security costs like overtime pay for police officers who escort the presidential motorcade or provide security along the travel route. There is little transparency in determining the cost of presidential travel. A White House spokesman declined to say how the White House and the DNC divided the cost of Obama's western trip, citing security concerns. Other administrations have declined to comment on the same grounds. A report conducted by the Democratic-controlled House Oversight and Government Reform Committee while President George Bush was in the White House concluded taxpayers paid for about 97% of presidential travel, the Republican Party just 3%. Sepp says there's no reason to believe the breakdown is much different with the Obama administration or other White Houses. ""Ever since Ronald Reagan's administration, presidential travel has carried with it a lot of controversy over cost as well as politics,"" Sepp says. ""Even Richard Nixon was cited for having traveled a great deal abroad, when he was having domestic political troubles."" In 1995, President Bill Clinton attended eight fundraisers in four days on a cross-country swing. Taxpayers often pay for travel to campaign events that rally support rather than raise money, like Bush's dramatic entrance into a baseball stadium in Fort Myers Florida less than a month before his re-election in 2004. Call it a perk of the presidency, something a mere candidate does not enjoy. ""And that's the point when the parties themselves have to pay for the cost of the pomp and the circumstance,"" Sepp says. ""The pomp and the circumstance gets a lot smaller, a lot more modest.""","It's standard practice for presidents, both Democratic and Republican .

"London (CNN) -- When considering risks to their business, employers tend to worry about hackers or burglars, but the biggest threat to security might come from within. According to a study conducted by information management company Iron Mountain, a third of 2,031 European office workers surveyed admitted that they had taken or forwarded confidential information out of the office, and one in seven had taken confidential information with them to a new job. Another 31% said they would deliberately remove and share confidential information if they were fired. Data breach is a common concern for businesses, but Peter Eglinton, Iron Mountain's Senior Vice President for UK, Ireland & Norway, says they tend to focus too much on monitoring for attacks from outside, while ""the people side of the organization and the hard copy are forgotten about."" ""You can see who's hacking in and taking information, but people don't leave a trail,"" he says. ""Therefore, if you don't have good policies in place, it's very difficult to work out what has happened with information."" Although we may not always consider the data we work with day in and day out to be particularly exciting, Eglinton says that in any given business there are several functions that might use or create information that's commercially valuable or subject to privacy laws. ""HR or finance will have an awful lot of access to very sensitive information,"" Eglinton says. ""Sales and marketing will have access to customer data, and some of the service organizations will have a lot of information about their patients or their customers."" See also: Work skills you'll need to survive the 'conceptual age' Of the workers who admitted to taking confidential information to a new job, half said they believed they had a right to take information, and most said they took information because they had been involved in its creation. Although pervasive, this sense of ownership is misguided, says Eglinton. ""The information you create in your daily work doesn't belong to you because you created it,"" he says, ""it belongs to the organization that's paying you to do that job."" The study also revealed that most of those who had taken information when they left a job had relieved their employers of customer databases. See also: Have you got the career X-factor? This, according to Chris Pounder of UK data protection training organization Amberhawk, is ""a dangerous thing to do."" Privacy laws vary from country to country, but in the EU, for example, any processing of information that relates to a living person is a breach of the Data Protection Directive. Although some consultants and lawyers might be able to negotiate permission to transfer clients with them when they leave a company, Pounder says: ""If an employee took a database of customers without the consent of their employer, they are risking a criminal offense. ""And if they did it to set up their own business, they're also vulnerable for someone taking a civil case for damages."" Besides, making a gift of illegally obtained information is unlikely to ingratiate you to a new boss. Pounder points out that a new employer who knowingly receives personal data obtained in breach of data protection laws could also be liable for damages caused. So, what can businesses do to protect their data? Information management companies offer solutions ranging from encryption software to systems that allow organizations to track the whereabouts of files across multiple sites. But Eglinton thinks simply communicating policies regarding information ownership is a good first step towards alleviating the problem. ""I don't think you need to have security guards on the door every day, but reminding people of the policy, and auditing those processes, would go a long way towards managing information more securely,"" he says. Regardless of how information leaves a company -- whether due to malice, professional pride or as more businesses allow telecommuting -- Eglinton believes there is always cause for concern. Even those who take documents home for entirely legitimate reasons and with their employer's consent might be endangering security. ""How do you manage information created on the train on the way into work?"" he asks. ""And how do you manage that information thereafter? If people are taking information out of the office, how do you know that information comes back or is securely destroyed?"" Eglinton predicts that, as the volume of information created grows, executives need to consider ""not just the value you get from information, but how you protect it, because it's a hugely valuable asset, but often nobody has responsibility for it.""","Study: One in seven European workers have taken confidential information to new job .

"(CNN) -- There's no question that losing your job can be a jolting experience, as anyone who has had the misfortune of being laid off in recent years can attest. But what if that jolt could be a positive experience? That's the suggestion to come out of recent research which looked into the experiences of laid-off mid-to senior-level managers in the United States and Australia. The participants' overwhelming response was that the experience of losing their jobs in the previous 12 months had given them a renewed interest in living according to their values. The ""crisis"" of redundancy was in fact an opportunity to get to better know themselves, and reassess their priorities to lead more fulfilled, happier lives. ""All of the respondents, which surprised us, talked about the positives associated with this jolt of job loss,"" said study co-author Amy Kenworthy, a professor of management at Australia's Bond University. ""These people took that jolt and focused on the positives of it to recalibrate themselves in terms of 'Who am I and what do I want from life?' It was counter-intuitive with what we thought was going to take place."" Read more: Want to be a leader? Act like one . Kenworthy said as their research was exploratory, and focused specifically on the experiences of those in middle-to upper-management, it did not necessarily represent everybody's experiences. She said it reflected the way people could lose themselves and gradually become divorced from their personal values as they climbed the corporate ladder. Only a quarter of the responses from participants -- who ranged in age from their early 30s to late 50s, and nearly half of whom held doctorates -- related to feelings of self-doubt and cynicism, which the researchers had assumed would be the predominant response. ""It's normal to be angry and upset and scared and frustrated, and to experience not only self-doubt, but cynicism about the process and the organization,"" said Kenworthy. Instead, the respondents expressed a desire to lead their lives with more ""authenticity"" and integrity, even if it meant forgoing corporate benefits or a high salary -- perhaps a luxury that former mid-to senior-level managers can afford. Their new priorities fit into three clear categories: the desire for a more balanced quality of life, with more time for family and friends; more meaningful work which they felt contributed to society; and job security and happiness. ""People said things like: 'I didn't realize how toxic work my environment was, and how important a criterion that should be',"" said co-author Suzanne de Janasz, professor of leadership and organization development at Swiss business school IMD. Said Kenworthy: ""All of them expressed a genuine desire to be true to oneself as they moved forward to the next chapter of their careers. It was everything from 'I want to spend more time with my kids' to 'I know I have much more creative talent than I was able to demonstrate in my last job.'"" Read more: Why we pick bad leaders . Two respondents had opted to write books following their redundancy. ""For many of us, at some level inertia takes over. It's the comfort of the routine, the comfort of the expected. It's hard to break out of that,"" said Kenworthy. ""The jolt of job loss may in fact be something that is very useful to people and there may be some very clear benefits to come from it."" The authors said there were lessons for organizations from their research: that cutting back hours and salaries might be a mutually satisfactory way of getting through lean times, as it would allow employees to address their work-life balance. Where layoffs were unavoidable, organizations could offer affected employees workshops to help them to assess and prioritize their values, rather than simply update their resumes. More broadly, the findings were a useful reminder, as the times of economic uncertainty continued, that there was always a potential upside to a downturn. ""There is something we can take from the Chinese written language that they have understood for a very long time -- that crisis can mean opportunity,"" said Kenworthy. ""We don't frame things that way, but maybe we should.""","New research suggests that redundancy can ""jolt"" people into happier, more fulfilled lives .

"(CNN) -- I am a long-time fan of reality television: first American Idol, then, So You Think You Can Dance, Project Runway, and Master Chef. The mythologist Joseph Campbell provides an explanation for the success of these programs: ""A hero ventures forth from the world of common day into a region of supernatural wonder; fabulous forces are there encountered and a decisive victory is won; the hero comes back from this mysterious adventure with the power to bestow boons on his fellow man."" Isn't this what happens in reality TV? We see people who are hoping to be called out of their everyday lives to an adventure, to be tested on a road of trials in hopes of obtaining the ultimate boon. Watching, we find pieces of ourselves mirrored in the contestants; we, too, are on the mythic journey of a hero. Our careers are a hero's journey -- a call to adventure . Early on, it's fairly easy to see yourself as the hero. I, for example, fancied myself as Tess McGill, of the movie Working Girl, having started out as a secretary. But mid-career, accepting a beckoning call is far more difficult. You likely have achieved some success; the stakeholders in your life, including you, may be rather attached to the status quo. Mid-career, the ""another day, another dollar mindset"" can quickly sideline us if we avoid challenges and the growth our work can bring. What's important to remember here is that the dialing-it-in plateau can be a precipice: we avoid a career-killing plateau by accepting the call to a new adventure. It may mean taking a pay-cut, a demotion in terms of job title, or simply striking out into the uncharted waters of entrepreneurship. And daunting though it may be, we keep in our intellectual back pocket one of the findings of disruptive innovation theory: the odds of success are six times higher, the revenue opportunity 20 times greater, when we disrupt, and accept the call to adventure. See also: Is workplace boredom 'the new stress?' A road of trials or succession of tough experiences is inevitable . Often they will come from where we least expect them, one obstacle being entitlement. We may believe, for example, that we have the right to a perk or promotion simply because we have shown up (when we played soccer as kids we all got trophies whether we won or lost, played or sat on the bench; why wouldn't this also be true at work?) Mid-career, we may be inclined to become benevolent dictators to our staff, deciding consensus isn't required. After all, we are literally en-titled. In battling the dragons of entitlement and complacency, you become the hero of your career. When you make and own your choices, fearlessly facing your challenges, you become someone whom others want to follow: ""leader"" is just another name for hero. See also: Jumping off the career ladder . You are not meant to undertake this journey alone . Most heroes in literature and film have a guide or a trainer: Frodo had Gandalf, Luke Skywalker had Yoda, King Arthur had Merlin -- guides, who aren't about exploiting you for their gain, but for whom your boon is also theirs. If you want to be the hero in your own story, seek out and cultivate the right kind of mentors. I could never have made the leap from secretary to professional without the sponsorship of a mentoring boss. If you are a professional woman, a guide is even more essential. We often measure the success of our career by how much money we make and our job title, and those are important yardsticks -- and an undeniable piece of achieving the boon. But a true hero looks to the horizon with a vision of the legacy he or she can leave -- what happens in the life of the company, the people you worked with once you are long gone. Ultimately the real boon of a hero's journey is not that others will believe you are a hero, but when you look in the mirror, you will see one. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Whitney Johnson.","Our careers are a hero's journey -- a call to adventure, argues Whitney Johnson .

"(CNN) -- These days, it's seems like we are all expected to do more with less. Spending hours in the office to make sure all the assigned tasks get done bleeds into our family time, and even at home, it seems there's a never-ending cycle of things that must be done. Yet studies have shown that 60-hour workweeks can result in a 25% decrease in productivity. The productivity numbers get worse as the work hours increase, because exhaustion steadily erodes judgment and performance. So what to do when there's too much to do? The key is to do less, not more (what, you've never heard a time management expert tell you the key to success is to do less?). See also: Don't let e-mail run your work life . Just say no . First, say ""no"" to more work. Though this might sound obvious, it's one of the hardest things to actually do. But being realistic about the amount of additional work you can take on is as important as getting the job done. A simple, ""Sorry -- I'd love to help out, but I don't have the bandwidth to take that on right now,"" is sufficient. Negotiate . When that fails, negotiate. If your boss presents you with a project you can't outright refuse, but your plate is undeniably full, don't hesitate to point this out. Openly discuss your current deadlines and workload, and communicate both honestly and clearly. For example, you might say, ""I'm currently working on X, Y, and Z. I want to return quality work in a timely way, and if I take on this new project, it will jeopardize my promised deadlines. Would you like me to hand it off to someone else, outsource it, or would you prefer to reprioritize my existing commitments?"" See also: Is workplace boredom 'the new stress?' Prioritize . Focus on strategic enablers of business. Everyone has too much to do, and nobody really cares how many tasks you crossed off a to-do list if key projects keep falling through the cracks. Split your to-do lists into a Master list and a High Impact Task (HIT) list. While the Master lists tracks everything that needs to get done at some point, the HIT list includes only a reasonable number of items that can be accomplished each day, so you're constantly focused on key priorities and work on them in the proper order: . P1: You will get fired if this isn't done today. P2: A valuable long-term activity that should be done soon. P3: Someone will be unhappy if this isn't done eventually. P4: Human ""pain-management"" activities such as socializing or Facebook. Focus . Master the skills of concentration. Stop multitasking and focus on one thing at a time. Multitasking just dilutes your attention and fools you into thinking you're productive, when you're really just busy. Don't allow people to hold distracting conversations outside your cubicle or office door either. Limit your social media usage, and anything else that can keep you from accomplishing your most important tasks. When you find ways to do less while increasing your impact, you'll gain more time to spend on things you actually enjoy. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Laura Stack.","These days we are all expected to do more work, says Laura Stack .

"(CNN) -- Just as it's tough to ride 100 miles on my bike without a few good snack or stretch breaks along the way, today's 24-7 ""always on"" world of work makes ""switching off"" even more vital than ever to maintain productivity, focus, and energy at work -- and to preserve some form of a life with friends, pets, spouses -- and yourself. The work marathons demanded by this challenging decade need programmatic, regular recharge respites if you're in it for the long haul. Having flunked retirement twice, I'm addicted to my work, which I love -- even after 42 years of flat-out entrepreneurship, including these latest two exhausting and exhilarating years writing, publishing, and traveling to lecture about ""Startup Owner's Manual,"" which I co-authored with customer development pioneer Steve Blank. As a 42-year confessed workaholic captured by a nonstop stream of 200-plus daily emails hitting multiple devices, I've developed (and stolen) dozens of ""turn off"" tools and tricks to pull myself away from the info onslaught besieging millions of us worldwide. This ""nonstopitis"" disease affects entrepreneurs like me most of all, and I hope to cure the ""disease"" before I find myself too busy to attend my own funeral. See also: Don't let e-mail run your work life . My favorite and newest trick decouples brain from electronic communication devices for a few hours at least once or more every single day -- a major life improvement -- just as many did in our parents' generation, who decoupled simply by leaving the office in the ancient pre-iPhonian era.

To save your own life, create your own list of ""tricks"" and of rules to impose on yourself. Some of mine that work: . • Switch gears: When tired of ""project A,"" switch to something else on the list -- easier, different, faster-paced or (gasp) fun. Changing rhythm is restorative and you return to the tougher project fresher in an amazingly short time. • Change chairs and media -- draft that important thing in (gasp) longhand in a club chair or on a sofa. • I sequester all devices in my home office no later than 10pm each night, knowing that friends, daughter, and business partner all know my home phone ""just in case."" But it helps make the day actually end! • All devices stay in the car when we visit or go out with friends. The break from each is immensely liberating. • ""No device"" mealtimes are de rigeur for wife Fran and I, but we're still working on liberating our daughter and her husband. A glass of wine at dinner (not two) slows me down just enough to return to the keyboard with fresh energy. • A mid-afternoon cigar or swim. Those 15-20 minutes change all the energy and clear the head, like pushing ""restart"" on a device. • A 20-minute exercise break, ideally coupled with a five-minute shower (easiest for work (at-home)aholics).

"(CNN) -- ""These types of patients have such disfigurement beforehand they can't eat, they can't breathe properly. It's about functionality,"" says Dr. Richard Luskin, CEO of the New England Organ Bank. Luskin is referring to the small group of people worldwide who are on waiting lists in hope of a new face, and in the United States at least, they may now have one donated to them more readily. Last month the United Network of Organ Sharing (UNOS), a non-profit organization managing the U.S. organ transplant system, approved the first national policies for the transplantation of limbs, faces and other structures collectively known as ""vascularized composite allografts"" (VCAs) -- which should make it easier to find donors. As of April 2014, there had been 28 face transplants across the world. Animal attacks, severe burns and gunshot wounds had left these recipients scarred for life, literally, in the one place their scars cannot be hidden -- their face. ""Anyone with this disfigurement would argue they're not living, they're surviving,"" says Luskin. Face transplant recipients: New findings . A growing field . The first face transplant was performed in France in 2005 on Isabelle Dinoire, whose mouth, nose and chin had been chewed away by her dog. Since then the field has grown and transplants involving varying combinations of facial parts have been performed in six other countries, including the United States. As the procedures improve and their safety grows, donor registries and collaborating hospitals will increasingly be asking the question: Would you like to donate your face? Or in the case of the UNOS approval, asking family members of potential donors the sensitive question of whether they will donate the face of their loved one. The UNOS approval will initially be in place temporarily for 15 months to enable public comment, but families of donors will receive extra guidance when it comes to making the decision. ""Face transplants remain unique and require very specific criteria such as hairlines and ethnic components,"" explains a UNOS spokesperson. ""Therefore consent should be distinct and individual."" ""(This) will broaden the donor pool for wait-listed patients across a number of regional and national organ procurement organizations,"" explains Dr. Eduardo Rodriguez, professor of reconstructive plastic surgery at NYU Langone Medical Center. ""A major component for a successful procedure is patient selection on both the recipient and donor,"" he adds. ""The likeliness of a perfect match can be very challenging."" But this once-experimental procedure is becoming more widespread and accepted. Richard Norris, from Virginia, received a new face in March 2012 and last month his face was featured on the cover of the U.S. edition of men's magazine GQ. Norris lost most of his facial features after a gun blast, and lost abilities such as his sense of smell. But after surgery at the hands of Rodriguez and his team he can live his life once again. Face transplant patients: Where are they now? Risk of rejection . However, as this mode of surgery becomes a norm, the side effects and risks that come with the life-changing operation are still a concern and a question of ethics. Like any other transplant, there is a risk of the new organ being rejected by the patient's immune system and recipients have to take immunosuppressive drugs for the rest of their lives, putting them at risk of infections and cancer. But unlike many other transplants, replacing a face is not a matter of life and death. The surgery is classed by some as life-changing, not life-saving, which raises questions as to whether this risk is justified. ""For heart transplant patients they need a transplant or they will die. These (face transplant) patients are not in organ failure but are having to take anti-rejection medication and have lifelong repression,"" explains Dr. Maria Siemionow, from the University of Illinois, who performed a near-total face transplant in 2008 on American Connie Culp, who was shot in the face by her husband. But Siemionow is working to solve this problem. ""We need new therapies which will be less harmful,"" she says. The Polish surgeon is developing chimeric cells, which bring together the cells from a donor and the recipient during transplantation. ""We are fusing together cells from the bone marrow of donors and recipients so these cells will be recognized by the recipient's immune systems as their own,"" she explains. Not an easy task. By combining the two cells and delivering them into patients receiving a transplant, their immune system will learn to recognize the donor's cells, which are present throughout their new face, making their immune cells less likely to attack the face. ""If the (immune system) can recognize more cells as 'self' the patient will need less anti-rejection drugs,"" says Siemionow, whose experimental therapy is hoped to enter clinical trials in a few years and when it does, may make face transplants more acceptable to critics. ""Immunosupression is the main ethical concern and new therapies are crucial for the future of this field,"" she says. Luskin feels the benefits of a new face counter ethical doubts. ""There is no ethical issue,"" he concludes. ""I saw a patient walking down a crowded hospital hall a few years after surgery and no-one noticed them. He looked like a normal guy. To me, that's the point of these surgeries.""","The first face transplant was performed in France in 2005 .

"(CNN) -- While English has long been the de facto language of international business, more multinational companies are now mandating that employees communicate only in English. According to Tsedal Neeley, a professor at Harvard Business School, companies that don't adopt English as a standard for their entire organization will, at some point, ""experience some form of bottleneck."" ""It depends on what the company does, but if you'll have members in different countries needing to collaborate -- whether it's to integrate technology platforms or cater to customers worldwide -- it will become more important that even middle managers and employees with international assignments will need a common language in order to interface with others."" Airbus, Daimler-Chrysler, Nokia, Renault, Samsung and Microsoft Beijing have all mandated English as their corporate language, writes Neeley in the May 2012 edition of Harvard Business Review -- and she says more than 70 Danish companies have now migrated to English. In 2010, Japanese internet services company Rakuten made headlines when it announced it would become an English-only organization, with all communication, verbal and email, in English. ""English is the only global language,"" CEO Hiroshi Mikitani told CNN at the time. ""We're doing a global business. I think this is the only way a Japanese service organization can become a global organization."" ""If you want to become successful in other countries, you need to internationalize the headquarters,"" he added. To help make the transition, Japanese language signage was removed from cafeterias and elevators. Mikitani even conducts performance reviews with his Japanese executives in English, according to Neeley. If this sounds bewildering for employees, it can be. Two years into an English-only implementation at one company Neeley studied, 70% of employees reported feeling frustrated with the policy. That's why she says businesses must plan carefully before implementing an English-only policy. ""In the absence of language strategies, you see so many people getting hurt and diminished,"" Neeley says. ""When a company announces a language change without any thought or preparation for employees, many people lose the promotional path that they've spent their whole lives developing."" See also: Is workplace boredom 'the new stress?' Shifting a company's entire operations into a new language isn't easy. But Neeley, who has studied corporate language strategy for a decade, has some suggestions. • Companies need a clear, well-aligned strategy and ""it needs to be supported and implemented at all levels of the organization, from the CEO down to the supervisor/manager of every employee who is subject to having to convert to a new language,"" she says. • Off-the-rack tuition won't cut it. ""English lessons alone are not enough,"" Neeley says. ""If you have an aggressive environment where people work an extraordinary amount of hours and they're challenged with goals, language vendors need to help make sure you're capable of learning successfully while being successful at your job."" The best results come when instruction is customized to employees' roles, with vocabulary geared specifically towards the types of emails they write, for instance. • Go for broke. While some companies choose to become bilingual before adopting English wholesale, Neeley says this is ""incredibly expensive and unsustainable."" • Those with English as a first language need to make adjustments too. ""Native speakers need to learn how to dial themselves down and how to accommodate others,"" Neeley says. • Managers should adopt a zero-tolerance policy to backsliding, to make it clear that the change to English is not only possible but permanent. Depending on the company's size, resources and the aggressiveness of its pursuit of English, Neeley estimates implementation is ""a four to 10-year odyssey"", with ongoing maintenance required thereafter. But she says the journey is worth it, pointing out that a company with English proficiency across the board has greater operational agility and ""can serve all of their market seamlessly by using all of their human capital worldwide to achieve any end."" See also: Is happiness the secret of success? Immediately after acquiring a Canadian company, Rakuten was able to deploy seven of its top engineers to Toronto, to begin integration processes, according to Neeley. ""Two years ago they could have never done that,"" she says. ""That shows the extent to which expertise and knowledge flows through the company in ways it wouldn't otherwise."" For individuals too, there are benefits. Depending on their fluency and how far their career has advanced, an employee may experience performance anxiety and job insecurity when asked to work in a new language. But, Neeley says, as fluency increases, the emotional strain diminishes and bilingualism becomes something enjoyable. Perhaps even profitable. ""You also see them starting to shoot up in their careers,"" Neeley observes. ""They begin to take on roles that require more and more communication in the English language.""","More companies mandating English as their corporate language, says Harvard Business School professor .
Japanese company Rakuten is among those that have gone ""English only""
Expert says employees can experience performance anxiety while making transition to English ."
"Bangui, Central African Republic (CNN) -- In two days I will leave the Central African Republic (CAR), concluding a four-month assignment here for the U.N. Refugee Agency. But today, instead of packing, I'm assisting with the relocation of 1,259 people facing death threats in the PK12 neighborhood of Bangui, the capital city. I arrived here on New Year's Day for an emergency humanitarian mission and quickly became a witness to the formation of enclaves like this one, where residents fear for their lives. Since December, nearly one million people in CAR have fled their homes amid brutal attacks and reprisals by warring factions -- chiefly the Seleka and anti-Balaka militias. More than half the country's 4.6 million people are now in need of humanitarian help. But few are in graver danger than the people trapped in numerous neighborhoods like PK12. I first visited one of these enclaves in late January, when I travelled to Bozoum in the country's northwest. Passing through MISCA peacekeepers, I entered a corner of the town where several thousand people had sought refuge. Their fear was palpable. I could see it in their eyes, in their posture and most of all in their alertness to everything happening around them. In PK12 I hear similar stories of people displaced from their homes and then trapped during their flight to safety. The humanitarian community is aware of 15 places where entire communities are currently at risk, though their numbers and locations are in continuous flux. Some have been evacuated, as with Bozoum. Some have fled on their own, taking enormous risks in becoming refugees in neighboring countries. And some have fled into the bush, like the people from Boboua, midway between the capital and Bozoum. When I met them in mid-February, they were in a desperate state, fearing for their lives after a month in the bush. Still others, as in Boda, west of Bangui, have become imprisoned in their own homes. Each of these besieged communities faces distinct circumstances, and holds its own views. The people in Boda want to stay in Boda, where many of them were born and raised. But they also demand freedom of movement: the right to go outside their neighborhood, a small area that would fill only a few city blocks. They're not just seeking a sense of normalcy and human dignity -- this is about pure survival. A couple weeks ago, anti-Balaka fighters killed two women from Boda when they went beyond the bounds of their neighborhood to gather food in a nearby forest. Some members of the Boboua community have returned, while others have fled to different enclaves. A fragile agreement there allows for coexistence, but there is a constant threat of outside interference from anti-Balaka groups in neighboring villages. But despite the harrowing conditions in Boda, there is also reason for hope. Vulnerable members of the Boda community -- as well as those who have not been targeted but are also living under a constant threat of the anti-Balaka and have been displaced from their homes -- are trying to neutralize a minority of spoilers to open up room for discussions. But hope is harder to find in other enclaves, each of which has its own dynamics and characteristics. The humanitarian community looks at each situation separately, and for months we have been fervently trying to identify the best way to protect these individuals' fundamental rights to physical security and to provide the means for their basic survival. The international forces have been critical, but we have also been grappling with a steadily ticking clock and the stark reality that people can only survive so long in such conditions, both physically and psychologically. We also need to defer to the views of the community. In the case of PK12 this past weekend, people were demanding assistance to safely leave for more peaceful parts of the country. As I interact with members of the community, many of them frighteningly frail, I ask myself: Did we wait too long in accepting relocation, a measure of last resort? And I wonder: Will they ever be able to return to their former homes in and around Bangui? Right after the convoy departs, belligerents pillage the mosque in PK12, underscoring the enormous challenges for future returns. But even more revealing, perhaps, is an exchange with three young children. As they follow me after leaving one of the trucks, I encourage them to return to their mothers. They respond, ""Madame, we are Central Africans, not Muslims.""","One million people in Central African Republic have fled their homes to avoid ethnic violence .

"(CNN) -- It's a special thing when a childhood idol does indeed turn out to be a real-life hero. Many students and adults responded with courage Wednesday morning when a 16-year-old sophomore allegedly attacked classmates with two knives at a suburban Pittsburgh high school. But only one person managed to stop the horrific ordeal: Sam King. The Franklin Regional Senior High School assistant principal tackled the alleged assailant to the ground to end five gory, terrifying minutes inside his school, said Murrysville, Pennsylvania, police Chief Thomas Seefeld. It was an act of incredible bravery, yes. But not everyone was surprised it was King who did it. ""Mr. King has always been like a storybook hero, ever since we were little,"" former student Challon Fisher wrote on Twitter. ""Love that man."" Added Julia Bolkovac, who graduated from the school last year: ""If there was one guy in the school who I thought would do that, it would be him."" 'What Mr. King did is just awesome' Sam King wasn't alone. Three others -- a school security guard, Assistant Principal Joan Mellon and patrolman William ""Buzz"" Yakshe, working as the school resource officer -- also played a part in subduing the suspect, identified as Alex Hribal. ""They were all extremely instrumental,"" said Westmoreland County District Attorney John Peck. ""In coming out (and seeing) chaos in the halls (and the aftermath of) an attack on a number of students, people were rushing by ... Those four individuals showed no lack of courage."" The security guard suffered stab wounds in the melee -- the sole adult injured, in addition to at least 20 students -- just before King who provided the tackle that ended the bloodshed. Heroes in all forms step up during school stabbing . While authorities didn't detail King's role immediately, social media quickly outed him as a hero. ""What Mr. King did is just awesome,"" wrote one Franklin Regional alumnus now at Penn State. ""A great man becoming a hero when people needed him most."" Another former Panther described King as her hero since she was 7. One student lauded him as ""the man of the year."" And another said King was due a simple, but deserved, tribute whenever the school reopened. ""I'm feeling a standing ovation for Mr. King the next time i see him in lunch,"" he tweeted. King known for being 'there for his students' Many students praising King on Wednesday had known him for years, back to the time he was an elementary school principal. ""He has always had a relationship with each and every student,"" said Fisher. ""... Mr. King's personality is something people look up to, just because of how caring it is."" King graduated, in a sense, to his new job at the high school two years ago, according to Fisher. Bolkovac said that wherever he went, King was looked up to as ""a role model."" ""He was a big guy walking around the school,"" she told CNN. ""He made an effort to make everyone feel welcomed."" That's what Matt DeCesare, a current Franklin Regional Senior High student, thinks as well. Students don't have anything negative to say about him; what they will say is that he is ""very agreeable"" and always willing to help anyone out. ""He's really there for the students,"" DeCesare said. ""... He is always doing things (in their) best interest."" Never was that more true than Wednesday.

"(CNN) -- Whenever I trade my smart phone in for a smarter model, I feel good that I'm back on the leading edge of mobile technology. And I may well be, but never for long. It seems that just as I pry the gadget's box open, an even faster, sleeker version is being touted in the tech blogs and showing up on the store shelves. Inevitably buyer's remorse sets in as I chastise myself: ""if only I had waited."" Innovation cycles have surely accelerated, with each offering more customization and a promise of being better. Perhaps you've noticed that something similar is happening in the workplace. A career, even for well-educated, seasoned professionals, seems harder to sustain in this challenging economy. You may feel like the shelf life of your skills is getting shorter. Even as unemployment rates remain persistently high, it's expected that in the United States only 20% of workers will have the skills needed for 60% of the jobs in the coming years. That's daunting for employers and employees alike. While companies are struggling to find the skilled talent they need, many individuals are struggling to stay relevant in the briskly changing talent marketplace. These twin tensions can leave top management and managers scratching their heads about how to cultivate and keep a stable, aptly skilled and engaged workforce. Individuals wonder if they should abandon current career paths to pursue high-demand opportunities where they must start from scratch. Luckily we can take a page from a fast-growing innovation in the worlds of product and increasingly services, that can provide a release valve: mass customization. Yep, you can customize your phone with apps, you can customize coffee drinks and even some of the clothes on your back (and shoes on your feet). Imagine, as well, that you can customize your career to better match the needs of your company and your own career-life fit. How employee freedom delivers better business . With this so-called mass customization of careers, individuals can co-design with their managers a zigzag sequence of jobs that are skill-developing opportunities. Rather than climb straight up a traditional corporate ladder, think of making strategic, lateral moves - on a corporate lattice - that are advantageous for you and your organization. You can hone your strongest skills in more varied circumstances. That way you can have more control over your career-life fit with the flexibility to move in various directions in a customized career trajectory. This approach isn't just good for the individual. Companies gain a more versatile, collaborative -- and engaged -- talent base by moving employees up, down and across the business in strategic ways. It also affects financial performance since holding onto experienced employees drives corporate talent acquisition costs down, positively impacting the bottom line. Career customization is about enabling workers, not simply entitling them. Employees and employers share the responsibility and the opportunity of openly discussing choices and trade-offs -- for the individual and the firm. Done well, this gives organizations powerful collateral to retain employees, and attract new ones, as it becomes known as a place where a high performance culture and a sustainable career-life fit are inextricably linked. Freedom key to workplace of the future . For employees, it means building a sustainable career with varied skillsets, more future career options, and an ability to build and enhance their personal brand. Consider the following as you develop and manage your own customized career: . 1. Mark yourself to market by taking inventory of your skills, experiences and capabilities, valuing their market relevance, and positioning them all as a portfolio to create a consistent and compelling impression. Ask yourself the tough question: ""How well am I doing at acquiring sought-after skills and competencies?"" Take action when you don't like the answer. Also, assess how well you are building your personal brand and what it says and means to others. 2. Maximize option value by actively seeking out those opportunities to build new skills -- either in your current role or by taking on a new role at your organization. Ask yourself what actions you can take to create alternative futures for yourself â€” and greater value for your company. The more valuable you are to your organization, the more options you will have both inside and outside its walls. 3. Optimize your career-life fit by asking yourself what you most need -- and what trade-offs you are willing to accept -- to be fulfilled in your profession, family, community and other pursuits at any point in time, and over time. Career customization may be one viable solution to help fill the gap between the growing talent shortage and the need to build sustainable, adaptive careers.

"(CNN) -- Do you like you? Perhaps you ought to put a ring on your delightful self. Mention ""self-marriage"" in any given group, and many people will likely chuckle over the notion of a sad, slump-shouldered bachelor who's given up on the idea of ever finding love, or a gift-grubbing girl just in it for the gravy boat and stand mixer. Jewelry designer Jeffrey Levin and branding and consulting expert Bonnie Powers are hoping to march in and alter that perception with their new ""I Married Me Self-Wedding In a Box."" The husband and wife team raised $6,116 in a recent Indiegogo campaign to produce and market the kit, which contains a handmade ring, ceremony instructions, three ""Promises To Me"" and an affirmation card for each day of the week. It's not about giving up, they say, but rather about lifting up and celebrating the singular awesomeness of yourself. CNN spoke with Howard about the importance of saying ""I do!"" to you and why the couple is so wedded to the notion of self-marriage. An edited transcript of the conversation is below. CNN: If you make a public declaration that you're marrying yourself, does that mean you've resigned yourself to being alone forever? Bonnie Powers: This isn't about waiting for the right one. ""Well, I haven't met the right one, so I'm just going to marry myself."" It's so not about that. We reframe it to say that when you love yourself, increase moments of positivity, and can amplify your own sense of awareness about your emotional state, it increases your health. Happiness is contagious. Let's say you're an individual person who does this on your own and you tell your family, ""Hey, I just married myself, you should do it!"" People might say, ""WHAAAT?"" But when they understand that it's about affirming that you have all this love and importance, they get it. And when you do this in front of or as part of a group, being socially connected and supporting each other and creating community around it definitely amplifies the experience. At our own wedding, after we said our vows, we had our guests marry themselves. We had 120 people there and after each vow when we had people say that they promised to do it, and they together said, ""I promise!"" there was joy and elation on their faces. People had their fists in the air. The energy of that was pretty incredible. CNN: What if someone feels shy about doing this in front of people? Powers: It's not crucial, but it does enhance. For an individual person, this can be incredibly powerful. Some people might feel self-conscious in a group. And if doing this alone is a way they can reflect and come to the same place at the end, I support that. The kit is written for an individual but does have some alternate copy for a group. CNN: Have people worried that this could be seen as a selfish act? Powers: There have been questions around the idea that our society has become very ""me, me, me"" focused, and people wonder if this ritual is just about that. They're not necessarily seeing the deep meaning behind it. Part of it is being able to relate to the notion that this ceremony is a very authentic and loving thing that is symbolic, and not meaning to replace the idea of marriage -- if that is your thing. Some people are in committed relationships and they're not actually married. It doesn't have to be about that. CNN: What exactly is the goal of marrying yourself? Powers: There's a lot about self-wedding that is symbolic. It's about acknowledging that you are a lovable, adorable, amazing person with all these fabulous qualities, and sometimes that's really hard to stick with. When we have experienced the ritual with people, we see that it centers and focuses them on themselves and gives them some guidelines. Some of us have done a lot of work on ourselves. I studied yoga to deepen my understanding of various philosophies and take my yoga off the mat and into the world. Some people have done a lot of therapy or gone to a lot of groups. Not everybody has and some people don't know how to find that place within. We wanted to give anybody the opportunity, whether they are totally evolved and have been on that path for a long time and know how to get there or if they haven't entered that path to self-actualization and awareness. This can offer a road map. CNN: What happens in the ceremony? Powers: What we created is reflective of what we went through, asking ourselves, ""What are the things that you want to do? What is the place that brings you joy?"" It may be a memory or something sensory. Maybe you just love the beach and want to do this there. If you want to bring food and drink and wine or do something celebratory with Champagne, think about that. You can bring music. In the preparation, you get to think about the qualities you really admire about yourself, that build you up and make you feel lovable. We also ask people to think about the things that trip you up. Do you need to work on your self-esteem? Maybe you've made some mistakes and continue to judge yourself. Part of the path to loving yourself is forgiveness. We wanted that to be a very strong part of that process, and the ceremony takes you through as a way to get started and ground yourself. It talks about the symbolism of the ring and takes you through each of the three different vows. CNN: How important is the ring? Powers: There's a notion about these micromoments of positivity and that those add up. You need reminders sometimes that you can have positive moments in your life. Some people might carry around a piece of beach glass that they found, and it gives them a feeling of being connected to nature. People might hold in their hand, or touch an object that has some kind of symbolism. The idea of the ring is the same thing. You have something that you are wearing that reminds you to come back to yourself and focus on the present and what makes you loveable and brings you happiness and joy. We have a lot of discussions about the ring. Jeffrey didn't want it to be a throwaway object, something people wouldn't think is important. We wanted it to be sterling silver, and we also know that some people really like to wear gold. We find that people are adding it to the engagement and wedding bands that they already wear. CNN: Where do you see this going? Is it a movement? Powers: Certainly we would love the idea of people looking within themselves and recognizing their awesomeness -- because we all have awesomeness inside us, and we get tripped up and forget. Part of what Jeffrey and I want is for more people to focus on that in the most selfless way, so happiness and joy can spread. What do you think about self-marriage? Is it something you would ever consider? Weigh in via the comments below.","Self-wedding isn't about not finding the right one or giving up, says Bonnie Powers .
The goal is for people to recognize the ""awesomeness"" inside ourselves .
A ring is a tangible reminder of the promises you make to yourself at the ceremony .
The ceremony doesn't have to be public, Powers says, but it helps ."
"(CNN) -- Utah law enforcement officers mourned one of their own Thursday after a shooting left one officer dead and five others wounded. The Wednesday night incident took place when they were attempting to serve a search warrant. The six officers and the suspect were rushed to hospitals, Ogden Assistant Police Chief Marcy Korgenski said. Officer Jared Francom died from his wounds, Ogden police said early Thursday. ""Agent Francom has served the citizens of Ogden city with honor for seven years,"" authorities said in a statement. Francom is survived by his wife and two young children, the statement said. His widow, Erin, told CNN affiliate KUTV the officer ""loved his job more than anything. He loved his family. He was a good husband."" The suspect, identified as Matthew David Stewart, 37, suffered injuries not considered to be life-threatening, authorities said. Stewart's father, Michael, said the family was sorry for what happened, reported affiliate KTVX. ""He is a decorated Gulf War veteran from the first Gulf War,"" Michael Stewart said of his estranged son. ""I didn't know what he did over there. I know he's had some mental issues."" The wounded officers were identified as Sgt. Nate Hutchinson with the Weber County Sheriff's Office; and Jason Vanderwarf, Shawn Grogan, Kasey Burrell and Michael Rounkles. CNN affiliate KSL said Vanderwarf is with the Roy police and Grogan, Burrell and Rounkles are Ogden officers. Ogden Regional Medical Center said Thursday that Vanderwarf was treated and released. The four other officers remained in Ogden's McKay-Dee Hospital, spokesman Chris Dallin said. Three were in critical condition, and one was in stable condition, Dallin said. Several officials fought tears as they discussed the incident at a news conference . ""This is a family. This is a law enforcement family,"" Ogden Police Chief Wayne Tarwater said. ""The law enforcement community is mourning."" ""We have lost a brother,"" Weber County Sheriff Terry Thompson said. ""We will grieve this loss"" with the knowledge that Francom gave his life for his fellow officers and the community, he said. The officers, part of a multi-agency narcotics task force, were attempting to serve a search warrant ""based on probable cause there was drug activity"" at an address in Ogden, Tarwater said. He would not elaborate. Stewart's father told KUTV his son is not a drug dealer. The warrant was a ""knock-and-announce,"" meaning that officers knock on a residence's door and announce their presence, he said. If no one answers, ""under certain circumstances, they will go ahead and enter the home. That's exactly what happened."" When they entered the home, the officers came under fire, he said. The task force requires officers to wear bulletproof vests, he said, and ""as far as I know, the officers were wearing vests and protective gear."" Stewart has a ""limited criminal history,"" Tarwater said. He did not have specifics but said he believed Stewart's record was mostly misdemeanors. Asked about reports that as many as 12 officers were sent to Stewart's home, strike force commander Lt. Darin Parke told reporters that number is not unusual. There was ""not really a great deal that set this investigation apart ... other than the outcome,"" he said. The shooting will be subject to an internal investigation as well as an external review by the Weber County attorney, he said. Citing those investigations, police limited the release of information. Tarwater thanked the state of Utah, particularly police agencies, for their support. He said that at one point, at an Ogden hospital Wednesday night, there were ""40 officers from probably seven different agencies."" Gov. Gary Herbert met with families of the officers and said funds were set up for their future needs. ""Our hearts go out to them,"" he told reporters at one of the hospitals. Herbert ordered that state and U.S. flags be lowered in the city of Ogden to honor the officers, Ogden Mayor Mike Caldwell said. Thursday was Caldwell's first day on the job. Ogden is about 40 miles north of Salt Lake City in northern Utah. Clayton Payne, a resident of the neighborhood where the shootings took place, told KSL, ""I was sitting in the front room watching TV, heard three pops. My fiance asked if they were fireworks. I said, 'No, those are gunshots.' "" He said he ran outside after hearing what sounded like an AK-47. ""I ran out here to see what was going on, and I was escorted back to my house by the cops,"" he said. ""They said, 'Get in your house. Get down.'"" The shootings follow a year in which U.S. cities saw an increase in officers killed. The number of officers who died in the line of duty in 2011 increased 16% nationwide from last year, according to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. Last year, 177 officers were killed, compared with 153 in 2010, the organization said. CNN's Shawn Nottingham, Lateef Mungin, Scott Thompson and Samuel Gardner III contributed to this report.","NEW: Suspect is veteran of first Gulf War, had ""mental issues,"" father says .

"(CNN) -- The atmosphere is hushed and quiet as about 150 people take their seats. They're each clutching a folder and a tiny American flag. A few whisper about being nervous, but can't quite articulate why. It's the ubiquitous butterflies in the stomach that seem to come with any big day, any big decision. As big days go, this is one of the biggest. All these people are about to become citizens of the United States. They'll gain the right to vote, to work certain jobs, to serve on a jury and to run for office. In about an hour, at the end of their citizenship ceremony in Atlanta, they'll officially be American by choice. Jutka Emoke Barabas remembers that jittery feeling well. She was naturalized in 2000 in Honolulu, where she still lives, and is one of several CNN iReporters who spoke about why they chose to become American citizens. ""Everyone arrived too early and we found ourselves standing and waiting, hardly able to contain our excitement,"" she said. ""Everyone seemed to speak at the same time as they shared their stories with one another."" There was a soldier from Cambodia, and Emoke Barabas herself, a political refugee from Hungary. As a writer with dissenting views, Emoke Barabas said she had been thrown in a Romanian prison under former dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. Her father showed her a photo of the Statue of Liberty, telling her, ""This is the place where freedom lives."" After her release, she said she made it to Switzerland and, eventually, to the United States in 1990. Ten years later, she became a U.S. citizen. ""For me, American citizenship means freedom of expression and to live and work in a free country ... and not have to be afraid of being arrested or harassed because of owning certain common books or pictures,"" said Emoke Barabas. She also feels a sense of responsibility to her adopted country. ""To be an American is not just a great honor, but also an obligation to do more and reach higher."" Naturalized citizen: Four reasons why ""America is the best"" It has been a long wait in the Atlanta heat for the immigrants waiting to be naturalized this morning. The first in line arrived around 8 a.m. for a ceremony that starts at 9:30. But this is just the last stretch of the years-long marathon that most of them have been through to become Americans. For most people, it takes at least five years to become a citizen, and that's after you already have a green card -- permanent residency status -- a process that can take years itself. Many people at the ceremony have been in the United States for 10 years or more. One woman moved here in 1978. Mario Imania knows how she feels. It took him 17 years to become a citizen. He came to the United States from Bolivia in 1988 for school and wasn't naturalized until 2005. ""I'm thankful for the opportunity to stay, study and work [in the U.S.], but it was not free by any means,"" said Imania. ""The process was a nightmare that never ended: thousands of dollars and many years of fear and hopelessness."" Would he do it again? Yes, he said. Even though the United States didn't quite live up to all his expectations -- he feels society judges him based on ""race, color, origin, looks and, yes, marital status"" (Imania is gay) -- he still said, ""I love you United States. You're home at the end."" It's almost time. Friends and family start to stream in to the ceremony room -- they had to wait until all the candidates for citizenship were seated -- and the atmosphere relaxes a little. There are waves and smiles, a few excited babies and children. The room is now full with the candidates and their loved ones. The cameras start to come out. Roland Tadoum is one of those who clicked his camera all during his naturalization ceremony, too. He became a citizen in 2007, having moved to the United States from Cameroon 13 years earlier. ""I'd just graduated from high school, the political situation in Cameroon was evolving into a multiparty system, the country's currency had been devalued, the banks were failing, unemployment was at its highest, university officials and professors were constantly on strike,"" he said. ""It was a simple decision."" CNN iReport: ""I am accepted for what I am, not for what I represent"" Once in the United States, Tadoum earned his B.S. in computer science and went on to get an MBA. Today, he's a senior project manager for a large health care company. ""I don't know if my achievement could be reversed for an American moving to Cameroon,"" said Tadoum. Three officials approach the podium and the ceremony begins. Lights are dimmed, and the audience rises as a recording of the national anthem comes over the speakers. The officials say 54 countries are represented in today's naturalization ceremony. They list each one, asking the people from said country to rise, and every nationality mentioned is met with applause. Brazil, Ghana, Iran and South Korea get the loudest cheers. Everyone is standing now, all their countries' names having been listed. The time has come. ""Ladies and gentlemen, please raise your right hand."" Cameras flash, phones shoot video. Friends and family of the naturalization candidates surround them in the room, capturing the oath of citizenship. They finally finish the lengthy oath and there are claps and cheers. They are now Americans, citizens of the United States. Many are holding and waving their little American flags. Now it's time to say the Pledge of Allegiance. They stand with their hands over their hearts and face the flag. ""Pledging allegiance to the flag was one of the proudest moments of my life,"" remembers Stephen Park, who attended his own naturalization ceremony in 2005. Originally from Scotland, he moved to the States to be with his wife, who is from Chicago. The pair met online and decided to build their new life together in the United States. Park had a green card, ""but that wasn't enough for me,"" he decided. ""I believe strongly in the Constitution of this country and just having the right to work here wasn't enough. I wanted the right to vote and I wanted the right to call myself American."" ""No other country gives you the right to pursue happiness, and that is the right that I have grabbed firmly with both hands,"" Park said. ""A lot of people complain about this country ... but try living elsewhere without all the rights that you take for granted. In some ways, we immigrants are the lucky ones; we see more clearly the opportunities that this great nation affords all its people."" Immigrant: Becoming American doesn't mean giving up native culture . The citizenship ceremony only takes about 40 minutes in total. The new citizens grin as they are each handed their certificate of naturalization. Most stick around to take photos in front of the large American flag next to the podium, or a portrait of President Obama that is hanging on the wall. They proudly display their certificates of naturalization and wave their flags for the camera. They're Americans now -- Americans by choice.","This July Fourth, we ask naturalized citizens why they chose to become Americans .
Some wanted a better education or career opportunities .
Others needed to escape political or economic turmoil .

"(CNN) -- It would seem no one saw it coming -- not his parents, not students at his school. Described by his lawyer as ""a typical young kid"" who has ""never been in trouble,"" 16-year-old Alex Hribal shocked the people in his life and the nation Wednesday when he allegedly went on a rampage at his high school in Murrysville, Pennsylvania, stabbing or slashing 20 students and a security officer. No one knows yet what might have motivated the attack. But pieces of Hribal's story are starting to come together, so far painting a portrait of a teenage boy no one ever expected to show such violence. ""He's a typical young kid. He's a B+ student. The family is like Ozzie and Harriet. They have dinner together every night,"" said his attorney, Patrick Thomassey. ""All the students liked him. He wasn't a loner. He worked well in groups, and this happened. So there's a reason for it -- that's what I'm saying. And we have to get to the bottom of that,"" the attorney said. Hribal, who was arraigned as an adult, faces four counts of attempted homicide, 21 counts of aggravated assault and one count of possession of a weapon on school grounds. His attorney said he would file a motion to move the case to juvenile court. He also said it would be important to have his client examined by a psychiatrist to help determine ""where he is mentally."" ""I'm not sure he knows what he did, quite frankly,"" Thomassey said, adding that Hribal feels remorse. ""He's scared. He's a young kid. He's 16, looks like he's 12. I mean, he's a very young kid, and he's never been in trouble, so this is all new to him,"" the attorney said. 'Shy kid ... kept to himself' Mia Meixner, a student at Franklin Regional Senior High School, witnessed a part of Wednesday's attack. ""He (Hribal) was very quiet. He just was kind of doing it,"" she said. ""And he had this, like, look on his face that he was just crazy and he was just running around just stabbing whoever was in his way."" She said she didn't know the boy well, but he had been in a lot of her classes. ""From past experiences with him, he hasn't been violent at all. He's actually been a really nice kid from all the times I've talked to him. He was just more of a shy kid, and kept to himself,"" she said. ""He was nice whenever you would talk to him. I never thought anything bad would happen with him."" Meixner said she didn't know of Hribal getting bullied, which was something his attorney also said. ""I'm not gonna comment on what my client had to say, but I don't know anything about any bullying,"" Thomassey told reporters. Earlier, FBI agents seized Hribal's personal computer in hopes of discovering a possible motive, according to spokeswoman Kelly Kochamba. 'Not a troubled young man' Hribal appeared in court shortly after the attack, where it was revealed he has lived in Murrysville since he was 2. He has an older brother. Westmoreland County District Attorney John Peck argued against bail, saying there could be no conditions that would protect the community and noting Hribal made ""statements when subdued by officials that he wanted to die."" A judge agreed, and Hribal is being held without bail at the Westmoreland County Regional Youth Services Center. He did not speak to reporters as he was led into a waiting police car. According to Dan Stevens, the county deputy emergency management coordinator, Hribal had a very minor Facebook presence and didn't have much experience on Twitter. He is not believed to have had a cell phone. Adding to the mystery, Thomassey said his client ""was not a troubled young man to this point."" ""They (his parents) offer their condolences to everybody involved in this case. They're very upset. They did not foresee this coming at all,"" the attorney said. ""This is a nice young man. He's never been in trouble."" Assistant principal hailed as a 'great man' Stabbing shatters peace in quiet community . Heroes in all forms step up during school stabbing . CNN's Chelsea J.

"Washington (CNN) -- Congressional Republicans pummeled him with questions and accusations, all but accusing him of perjury. But John Koskinen just didn't sit there and take it. The IRS commissioner hit back. This all has unfolded over the past several days with Koskinen enduring two grueling appearances before House committees led by Republicans, who have been aggressively pursuing the controversy over IRS targeting of conservative groups. ""I didn't come out of retirement to play games,"" Koskinen told reporters after Monday night's marathon hearing before the House Oversight Committee. ""I came out of retirement to restore the credibility of the IRS."" He's new to the top job since the targeting revelations rocked the agency last year, and triggered congressional inquiries. But Koskinen, 74, a government veteran, is taking the brunt of congressional pressure now after the agency admitted it lost thousands of emails wanted by lawmakers investigating the scandal. Rep. Paul Ryan flat out questioned whether he was being truthful with Congress, and Darrell Issa, the Oversight chairman, called him out for being evasive. ""All the emails we have will be provided. I did not say I would provide you emails that disappeared. If you have a magical way for me to do that, I'd be happy to know about it,"" he said. That answer raised eyebrows in an environment where committee chairman are rarely crossed. E-mails: Ex-IRS official Lois Lerner queried Sen. Chuck Grassley invitation . Mixing it up . But it looks like Koskinen likes to mix it up, and from all appearances, it looks as if he likes to take the field when the chips are down. Firm, direct and experienced. That about sums up the no nonsense former corporate executive who also held top positions in government and is a big league Democratic political donor. He also doesn't really need a job. Financial disclosure papers show his personal wealth may be as high as $27 million. The White House described him as a ""retired corporate restructuring expert"" before President Barack Obama nominated him to the post last summer. ""John is an expert at turning around institutions in need of reform,"" Obama said at the time. ""I am confident that John will do whatever it takes to restore the public's trust in the agency."" Koskinen went to Duke undergrad and Yale Law School before clerking for a federal judge. He has political chops, too. having worked for a New York mayor, a senator, and was once deputy mayor of Washington during a financial crisis. He had a critical role in preparing for Y-2-K, and headed mortgage giant Freddie Mac when its troubles were spinning out of control. He also helped manage two government shutdowns in 1995 when he worked in Clinton's White House budget office. Larry Hirsch, a former Freddie Mac board member, told CBS that Koskinen boosted morale as the agency struggled to survive. ""Obviously after the financial crisis, the company was in internal and external crisis,"" Hirsch said after Obama nominated Koskinen for the IRS job. ""John walked in and immediately handled what was happening with the company. He had the quiet strength and openness to take a very depressed management team and employee group to give them the confidence they were valued and the company had a future."" 'Unflappable' and 'honest' Koskinen also served on the board of trustees at Duke University from 1985 to 1998 and chaired the board's business and finance committee during the tenure of then-University President Keith Brodie. Brodie, who is also a psychiatry professor, said he spent a lot of time working with Koskinen during difficult financial times at the university and called Koskinen ""remarkably talented."" And although congressional Republicans are questioning his integrity, Brodie said Koskinen was a ""very, very honest guy"" and steady. ""He was quite unflappable back then and really a joy to work with,"" Brodie said. Beating back accusations . While Koskinen could plunge a Duke University boardroom into a deferential silence, Congress is a very different animal. By the end of his question time on Monday, a dissatisfied Issa proclaimed: ""I've lost my patience with you."" But Koskinen kept his cool. Rep. Michael Turner, a Ohio Republican, tried to push Koskinen to say whether a crime had been committed amid the IRS scandal. Turner pushed back after Koskinen said he had not seen any evidence of a crime or any evidence for any number of other things relating to the lost emails belonging to former top IRS official Lois Lerner. ""We have no evidence whether she (Lerner) beat her dog, whether she beat children,"" Koskinen said. But then Turner questioned Koskinen's integrity when he said he would not call the FBI to investigate the agency. ""I reject the suggestion that my integrity depends on my calling the FBI,"" Koskinen said, and later said there were ""no facts"" behind Turner's criminal accusations. He later said he hadn't seen any evidence of ""wrongdoing"" in the loss of Lerner's emails, triggering more Republican incredulity. Fed official: IRS did not follow the law .

"(CNN) -- An 18-year-old Missouri resident received a life sentence Wednesday for the thrill killing of her 9-year-old neighbor, authorities said. Alyssa Bustamante received a life sentence for the October 2009 death of Elizabeth K. Olten, according to the Cole County Circuit Court clerk's office in Jefferson City. She also got 30 years for armed criminal action. Bustamante, who has the possibility of parole, allegedly told police she killed Olten because she wanted to know what it felt like to kill someone. ""These sentences are appropriate and fit what happened to Elizabeth at the hands of a truly evil individual who strangled and stabbed an innocent child simply for the thrill of it,"" Cole County prosecuting attorney Mark Richardson said in a statement. Bustamante, wearing a bright green inmate's uniform, apologized to the Olten family in court, according to CNN Columbia affiliate KOMU. ""I know that words can never be enough, and they can never adequately describe how horrible I feel for all of this,"" Bustamante said. ""I'm so sorry. If I could give my life to get her back, I would."" The judge ordered Bustamante, who entered a guilty plea in January, to serve her sentences consecutively. Bustamante was 15 at the time of the crime. ""Hundreds of law enforcement officers and regular citizens of Cole County searched for Elizabeth for two days and nights in the cold and pouring rain in October of 2009,"" according to Richardson. ""The discovery of Elizabeth's mutilated body in a shallow grave is something that this entire community has been grieving for more than two years."" Defense attorneys told reporters that the sentence was ""harsh"" and that their client was not fully competent and suffers from depression, KOMU reported. Bob Watson, media coordinator for Cole County Circuit Court, said a life sentence in Missouri equates to a maximum of 30 years on the charge of second-degree murder. Bustamante could serve a maximum of 60 years because of the consecutive sentence.","Defendant was 15 when she killed younger girl .

This Tennessee city, known for honky-tonks and country music, also happens to have North America's largest Kurdish community, an art gallery that shares its Picassos, Renoirs and Cezannes with a Wal-Mart heiress and a mustard yellow VW bus (It's called ""I Dream of Weenie"") that serves a wicked fine Sunday brunch from the rear passenger window. Just in time for the November 6 Country Music Awards, here are five more things you can only find in Nashville: . 1. A full-size reproduction of the Greek Parthenon . Before it became ""Music City,"" Nashville was known as the Athens of the South. In 1897 for Tennessee's Centennial Exposition, city fathers built a full-scale replica of the real Athens' most famous landmark. Originally made of plaster, wood and brick, Nashville's Parthenon wasn't meant to be permanent. But because it cost too much to demolish, Nashville decided, ""What the heck, let's just rebuild it with real marble floors."" So while the British Museum in London and the Greek government continue to duke it out over the Parthenon's original statues (since 1817, what's known as the Elgin Marbles, as in the Duke of Elgin who got them from the Ottomans, have been on permanent public display at the British Museum), Nashville continues to give locals and visitors the chance to gawk at a replica of one of the world pinnacles of classical architecture. It's such a perfect clone that during recent renovations, the 2,500-year-old Greek Parthenon sent an architect to Nashville's Centennial Park to snap photos of its spawn. 2. A cinnamon roll that makes international headlines . In 1996, an employee at Bongo Java, a popular Nashville coffee shop, noticed, right before he was about to bite into it, that one of its signature homemade buns bore an uncanny resemblance to Mother Teresa. Before he could so much as say three ""Hail Marys,"" the BBC, Paul Harvey and even David Letterman (Paul Shaffer wrote a song about it) made the bun famous. The real Mother Teresa got wind of the ""Immaculate Confection"" and even though she reportedly laughed about it, her people sent a cease and desist order. Although copyright law was probably on owner Bob Bernstein's side, the power on Mother Teresa's side convinced him and his $250-an-hour lawyer to change its name to ""The Nun Bun."" The renamed cinnamon roll was quickly dispatched to a glass-enclosed case in the front of the store, but in 2005, thieves broke in on Christmas, making off with the famed confection. Despite occasional sightings of the kidnapped bun, the $5,000 no-questions-asked-reward is still unclaimed. 3. An art festival that revolves around the tomato . You say tomato. I say Tomato Art Fest. This costume-friendly art festival, an annual undertaking in historic East Nashville's Five Points District, has grown faster than a tomato vine on Miracle-Gro. Hatched 10 years ago as ""kind of an accident"" by Meg and Bret MacFadyen, owners of the Art and Invention Gallery, it has become one of Nashville's premiere hipster events. It features 2,000 square feet of floor to ceiling art interpreting the tomato. Not only are tomato royalty crowned (both a Tomato King and Queen who march in the parade behind a brass band), but there are Bloody Mary taste-offs, tomato bobbing, tomato beauty pageants and wet burrito competitions. That's where competitors eat burritos as fast as they can while being hosed down by a firetruck-like hose. ""People come up with a tomato-related idea and we say, 'Does it hurt anybody? Great, let's do it,' "" Bret says. Bushels of art flood in from around the world. This year's winner for Best Use of Tomato Humor was retired elementary school guidance counselor Jim Hartline, whose Roma Coliseum featured columns fashioned from real tomatoes. There are also tomato haiku competitions and a tomato song writing contest. And yes, there's a CD featuring, among other top hits, Peter Cooper's ""Please Don't Throw Tomatoes at Me."" 4. Songwriting doctors and insurance agents . From the airport to the local Target to the 10 a.m. opening of Tootsie's Orchid Lounge on Broadway, musicians of all stripes croon their lyric-writing hearts out. At Parlor Productions on Music Row in a restored bungalow once owned by Randy Travis, even the nonmusically inclined write songs at corporate team building events put on by Ultimate Event Nashville. Companies such as American Express, Bank of America and Nissan send normally reserved execs to pen lyrics with songwriters who regularly produce songs for stars such as Brad Paisley, Faith Hill and George Strait. ""It's a blast for these folks who normally wear suits,"" says Robin Ruddy, a performer who used to tour with Rod Stewart, who owns the Grammy-producing Parlor Studio with her husband, Larry Sheridan. ""We divide them into teams, each led by a hit songwriter, and then each team writes a song, which we then record. Even if they can't sing, we get them out there singing and even line dancing."" After seven years of offering this ""American Idol for Suits,"" has Ruddy ever plucked out any potential talent? ""Ah -- no, but it's a really great fun bonding experience,"" Ruddy says. 5. A city tour in Milk of Magnesia pink bus . The Jugg Sisters -- aka Sheri Lynn Bucy and Brenda Kay Wilkins -- are the big-hair, blue eyeshadow and spandex behind the wackiest tour in Nashville. Nash Trash, their 90-minute comedy tour, rides past many of the city's country music's institutions. Tickets sell out months in advance to people hankering to get one of 32 seats on the sisters' trash-talking, dirt-dishing, yeehaw-yelling tours. Lap-size coolers of beer and wine are allowed. Needless to say, squeezy cheese hors d'oeuvres are also served.","Greek architecture and a Nun Bun keep things interesting in Nashville .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- A third suspect in the videotaped beating of a gay Atlanta man could be extradited to Georgia early next week from Pennsylvania, where he has surrendered himself to authorities, officials said Saturday. Darael Demare Williams, 17, of Atlanta is being held on $250,000 bond in the Erie County, Pennsylvania, Prison, corrections officer Ed Yeaney said Saturday. Williams surrendered himself on Wednesday night to Erie police, authorities said. Yeaney didn't have further details on what possible charges await Williams in Georgia in connection with the videotaped beating of Brandon White, 20, by three men outside an Atlanta grocery. Earlier this month, the FBI said it was investigating the case to determine whether it meets criteria for prosecution under the federal hate crimes statute. Meanwhile, on Saturday, Jay Abt, an attorney for one of the other suspects, 19-year-old Dorian Moragne, said his client knew White before the alleged incident. Abt made that assertion during a meeting of activists concerned about the case. Moragne, who turned himself into authorities, has been charged with robbery by force and aggravated assault, Abt said. White has said that he didn't know any of his alleged assailants. ""I have never seen one of those guys before. I go to that store plenty of times. Like I said, I don't bother anybody. I don't talk to anybody. That's just me. No, I've never seen one of those guys before,"" White told reporters on February 8. On Saturday, White's attorney, Christine Koehler, reiterated that her client denies knowing any of the three suspects. Another suspect, Christopher Cain, 18, has been charged with aggravated assault and robbery, police said. Atlanta police said the incident occurred February 4. The case came to light after a video circulated online showing three men punching and kicking White after he stepped out of the JVC Grocery and Deli in southwest Atlanta's Pittsburgh neighborhood. The men, believed to be members of a gang called Jack City, yelled: ""No f----ts in Jack City."" The store's surveillance video shows White, dressed in a purple shirt and black jeans with a cell phone to his left ear, exit the store along with another man. As soon as they step outside, White is accosted by his attackers. The surveillance video captured eight men standing around watching, two of them with video cameras in hand. One man lunges at White with a tire in his hands. White said he did not report it right away because he did not want to draw attention to himself. He said he could not even bring himself to watch the video at first, he was so humiliated and embarrassed. The video was released on WorldStarHipHop.com, and was posted on The Smoking Gun. When it went viral, White decided to talk to the police, he said. U.S. Attorney Sally Quillian Yates has said her office is looking into potential civil rights violations based on sexual orientation. Georgia does not have a hate crimes statute. Enraged gay rights activists have vowed that justice would be served, and residents appealed for an expanded police presence in their community. CNN's George Howell reported from Atlanta and Michael Martinez from Los Angeles.","Darael Demare Williams, 17, of Atlanta is being held in Pennsylvania on $250,000 bond .

"(CNN) -- ""I'm not concerned about the very poor."" Oops. Mitt Romney messed up. Again. This was a bigger ""oops moment"" for Romney than when he said a few weeks ago that the $374,327 he earned in speakers' fees over the course of 12 months amounted to ""not very much."" It was bigger than ""I like being able to fire people."" It was the biggest since he blurted out that corporations are people, my friend"" at the Iowa State Fair. Call it a Freudian slip, call it overconfidence emerging from a big win in the Florida Republican primary, call it a classic, out-of-touch-sounding ""Rich Romney"" gaffe. It may be all of those things, but this comment represents a scripted piece of the Romney campaign strategy. He hopes to co-opt an Obama campaign message aimed at appealing to the middle-class voters each will need in the general election. Did his inept remark reflect a poor understanding of this position except as an election strategy? One has reason to wonder. Whether it's policies that affect poor Americans, women, immigrants or the nation's ever-shrinking middle class, one gets the uneasy feeling that the positions Romney recites are crafted for political gain rather than from a sense of conviction about what is good or bad for this country. Why? On abortion, for example, the former Massachusetts governor supported the right to choose and a greater role for government in helping spread access to health care -- which won him votes in that liberal state. But he shed those positions when they would prevent him from attracting conservative Republicans on a national stage. He has famously and repeatedly done similar turnabouts, most recently when he faced Florida's Latino primary voters with a kinder, gentler version of his previously anti-immigrant rhetoric. Romney taking heat for ""poor"" comments . Of course, a conservative political candidate trying to both woo a big-government-averse base and appeal to general-election moderates would focus on the middle class. We may even understand when particularly cynical politicians tune their strategies toward higher-income Americans, who tend to vote in greater numbers than lower-income folks. But what is far more puzzling is the reason Romney gave CNN's Soledad O'Brien for what sounded very much like callous disregard for the poorest Americans. ""I'm not concerned about the very poor,"" he said. ""We have a safety net there. If it needs a repair, I'll fix it."" Actually, if you look at Romney's policy agenda, you will see that ""fixing it"" could not be further from his plan, unless it's doublespeak for ""eviscerating it."" Romney calls for immediate across-the-board cuts in nonsecurity discretionary spending. That would mean slashing the budget for many of the programs that comprise our safety net, by 5%, according to his spending proposal. These cuts would come on top of the 17% cut already affected by this summer's Budget Control Act. Romney: Middle-income Americans are focus, not very poor . Further, according to analysis from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, his proposals to cap total spending at 20% of gross domestic product, along with increasing already bloated military spending, cutting taxes and pursuing a balanced budget, would necessitate enormous cuts to vital programs. ""The cuts would measure 21% in 2016 and 36% in 2021,"" the center said. ""If policymakers exempted Social Security from the cuts and then cut all other nondefense programs by the same percentage, the cuts would rise to 30% in 2016 and 54% in 2021."" Funding could all be gutted that helps low-income students afford college with Pell grants, enables low-income women and their children to eat a more nutritious diet, covers the cost of the highly successful Head Start early-education program and pays for job training, housing assistance and veterans' health care. In short, Romney's plan would incinerate the very safety net that he claims to be his excuse for expressing no interest in addressing the needs of the ""very poor."" Oh, and how poor are the poorest 5% or 10% of Americans he seemed to be referring to, exactly? Even the census, which tracks household income for all Americans, doesn't say with precision, although it does note that households with annual income of $15,000 or less made up 13.7% of our population in 2010. I don't know about you, but I'm concerned about them. If Romney's lack of concern about the very poor came with a real plan indeed to fix a tattered safety net so that poverty rates could begin to decrease, he might be less vulnerable to the charge of being out of touch with voters. But as long as his gaffes and policy prescriptions continue to belie either a lack of understanding of the economic plight of Americans or a cynical political calculation that both ignores and will exacerbate that plight, Romney will go the way of his fellow ""oops""-prone 2012 presidential candidate. When he joins the ranks of the also-rans, don't worry about him. Given that his net worth is somewhere between $85 million and $264 million, if anyone in America has a ""very ample"" safety net to fall back on, it's Mitt Romney. Join the conversation on Facebook. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Karen Dolan.","Karen Dolan: Mitt Romney's remark that he's ""not concerned about very poor"" was telling .
She says it's classic Romney: out-of-touch, scripted to pander to middle-class voters .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A zoo in China has angered visitors by trying to pass off a hairy dog as a lion, Chinese state media reported. A visitor, surnamed Liu, told the state-run Beijing Youth Daily she discovered the fraud when visiting a zoo in a park in Louhe, a city in the central province of Henan, with her son. As they approached the cage marked ""African lion,"" they were shocked to hear the beast inside emit a bark. It was a Tibetan mastiff -- a large, hairy breed of dog. ""The zoo is absolutely trying to cheat us,"" Liu said. ""They are trying to disguise dogs as lions."" Other species in the park were similarly mislabeled, the newspaper reported, with another dog in the wolf cage, and a white fox on display in the leopard enclosure. The head of the park's animal department, Liu Suya, told CNN that the animals had been substituted for various reasons, and would be back in their rightful place soon. The lion and leopard had both been removed for breeding, she said, with the Tibetan mastiff placed in the lion's cage temporarily ""due to safety concerns."" Similarly, the dog had been placed in the wolf enclosure to breed a hybrid wolf-dog, she said. ""We're not doing it out of shortage of funds,"" she said. The substitute lion has drawn ridicule on Chinese social media, with one commenter describing the situation as ""absurd."" ""If this works why would people even bother to go to the zoo!"" wrote Guohebaxiaoma. ""Children will cry out 'look a lion came out!' at the sight of Tibetan Mastiff or 'look it's a rat!' seeing snake on the street...This is totally absurd!"" Yidongdexulaoshi said: ""This time you're lucky. Because perhaps next time you will find that all the animals in the zoo are played by the faculty. LOL."" ""It's way too ironic. Why doesn't the zoo simply just put the zookeeper in a cage with the sign ""Gorilla"" on its gate,"" Lanseyapingningliuxunqing added.

"(CNN) -- When training camps for big-time college football teams open in August, behemoth linemen and other players will get their first taste of new rules regarding how much food Division I schools can provide their athletes. In short, as much as they want. That's assuming a proposal that came out of the NCAA legislative council this week gets approved, as expected, by the Division I board of directors. It's a small change in benefits -- as of last season, athletes could receive three meals a day -- but not a sea change that could lead to players getting paid. Many athletes in the revenue sports think they should get a piece of the pie. Right now, executives get paid, coaches get paid, the referees get paid, the announcers get paid, the people who sell souvenir merchandise get paid -- but the players don't. Many athletes get a one-year scholarship (almost always renewed during all four years of eligibility) that covers tuition, books, room and board and related fees. Other football and basketball players walk on and receive nothing. Next year, they will be included in the unlimited meals, the NCAA says. But no pay for play, no salary for the at least 20 hours of work per week during the season. That's something many football and basketball players want to see change. University of Connecticut basketball player Shabazz Napier expressed as much at the Final Four men's basketball tournament a few weeks ago, when he made controversial comments about going to bed starving. While many fans focused on his comment ""There are hungry nights that I go to bed and I'm starving,"" he also talked about others profiting off merchandise he helped make popular. ""When you see your jersey getting sold -- it may not have your last name on it -- but when you see your jersey getting sold and things like that, you feel like you want something in return,"" he added. It's that sentiment that prompted former UCLA basketball star Ed O'Bannon to join with 20 other plaintiffs -- each of whom will file his own lawsuit -- against the NCAA for what they claim is the unlawful use of their likenesses in video games and other media. The current and former players have already settled a suit with one popular video game maker. O'Bannon's antitrust case is scheduled to begin in a federal courtroom on June 9, according to Sports Illustrated, which says the entire business model for major college athletics could change. Billions are at stake, says The Wall Street Journal. ""I'm not going to ruin college sports. College sports is changing. The rules need to change,"" O'Bannon has said. The NCAA contends that athletes are paid in the form of a free education, something that holds a lot of value both immediately and in the future. Athletes also get team-issued shoes and other athletic gear. But they are not allowed to sell them. Throw in paid travel, free coaching and free medical aid, and many sports fans think that's a pretty good deal. A poll conducted last year by Marist College Center for Sports Communication showed that about two-thirds of fans of college football and college basketball agreed that a scholarship for top players was sufficient. Still, the number of legal challenges for the NCAA seems to be on the rise. In March, the Chicago office of the National Labor Relations Board ruled that football players at Northwestern University -- a private school that fields teams in the Big Ten conference -- can unionize, deeming them school employees. Players are set to take their union vote on April 25. The players at Northwestern say they want better medical coverage, concussion testing, four-year scholarships that cover the entire cost of attendance, and the possibility of being paid. They're led by former quarterback Kain Colter and Ramogi Huma, founder of the National College Players Association and the College Athletes Players Association. The NLRB ruled that Northwestern football players should be considered employees because of the hours they put in, the control the university has over them and the revenue they generate. Northwestern is appealing the ruling to the national NLRB, maintaining that players are not university employees but ""students, first and foremost."" NCAA President Mark Emmert has called the idea of unionized collegiate sports teams ""grossly inappropriate."" ""It would blow up everything about the collegiate model of athletics,"" he said. The labor board's ruling only applies to Northwestern for now. So state lawmakers in Connecticut and Ohio are taking steps -- albeit opposite ones -- to address the issue at public colleges in their states. An Ohio measure approved recently says players ""are not public employees based upon participating in athletics for the state university."" But in Connecticut, state Rep. Matthew Lesser and other lawmakers are considering legislation that would allow athletes at the University of Connecticut to unionize, Lesser said after Napier made his ""no money for food"" comments. ""He says he's going to bed hungry at a time when millions of dollars are being made off of him. It's obscene,"" Lesser said. ""This isn't a Connecticut problem. This is an NCAA problem, and I want to make sure we're putting pressure on them to treat athletes well."" There is one other important legal matter that cuts right to the heart of the decades-old question whether college athletes should be paid or receive a stipend. Four college athletes, represented by attorney Jeffrey Kessler, filed a class-action lawsuit in March -- just as the NCAA basketball tournament was set to begin -- against the NCAA accusing it of ""illegally restraining competition for the services of players."" In layman's terms, the lawsuit argues college athletes should be paid and aims to end the old notion of amateurism in college sports. It would give a university the option of paying the players it wants most. It also calls for individual damages for the player plaintiffs. Kessler represents Clemson University football player Martin Jenkins; Rutgers University basketball player J.J. Moore; University of California football player Bill Tyndall, who played his senior season in 2013; and University of Texas-El Paso football player Kevin Perry, who also played basketball for the Miners in 2011 and 2012. While only four plaintiffs are named, the class-action suit proposes representing all Football Bowl Subdivision players and all Division I basketball players. In addition to the NCAA, the lawsuit -- which the National College Players Association is backing -- also targets the so-called ""power conferences"": the Southeastern, Big Ten, Big 12, Pacific-12 and Atlantic Coast. ""What we are saying is that it is fundamentally unfair for there to be rules that prevent athletes who create all of this"" from being paid, said Kessler, who has experience in suing sports leagues. CNN's Sara Ganim and Eliott C. McLaughlin contributed to this report.","Legal challenges highlight issue of compensation for college athletes .

"(CNN) -- The rumors have been whizzing around the pit lane for months, but Fernando Alonso says he's staying put at Ferrari -- at least for the time being. The Spaniard has moved to quell mounting speculation about his future with Formula One's oldest team ahead of its home race, this weekend's Italian Grand Prix at the historic Monza circuit. ""I have a contract for another two years and as I always say on the subject of rumors and to ensure calm, what I want is to continue for the necessary years,"" Alonso told the Ferrari F1 team's official website on Wednesday. ""Let's see if that can happen, but for the next two years at least, there is no problem."" Alonso joined Ferrari from Renault in 2010 and currently earns around $30 million a year, according to U.S. business magazine Forbes. But while the 33-year-old isn't short of cash, grand prix victories have been lacking in recent times -- he last took the checkered flag 27 races ago at the Spanish Grand Prix in May 2013. Mercedes and Red Bull have left Ferrari trailing in their wake this season, with double world champion Alonso recording just two podium finishes in 12 races. He is fourth in the drivers' championship, 99 points behind leader Nico Rosberg of Mercedes, while Ferrari is a distant third behind the German's dominant team. Alonso's relegation to also-ran so far this year has fueled speculation about his future, with both Red Bull and his former team McLaren rumored to be interested in signing him -- much to his annoyance. ""It's not nice, because it creates a bit of stress and it means it is disruptive for me, the fans and for the people in the team,"" he said. ""It's a year now that I've been saying I want to stay at Ferrari and extend my contract. That's my wish, I repeat it every two weeks, at the end of every race, yet it's never said, in fact there is a tendency for the opposite to be said.

"(CNN) -- The human heart beats 60 to 100 times a minute, more than 86,000 times a day, 35 million times a year. A single beat pushes about 6 tablespoons of blood through the body. An organ that works that hard is bound to fail, says Dr. Billy Cohn, a heart surgeon at the Texas Heart Institute. And he's right. Heart failure is the leading cause of death in men and women, killing more than 600,000 Americans every year. For a lucky few, a heart transplant will add an average of 10 years to their lives. For others, technology that assists a failing heart -- called ""bridge-to-transplant"" devices -- will keep them alive as they wait for a donor heart. Unfortunately, more often than not, the new heart doesn't arrive in time. That's why Cohn and his mentor -- veteran heart surgeon Dr. O.H ""Bud"" Frazier -- are working to develop a long-term, artificial replacement for the failing human heart. Unlike existing short-term devices that emulate the beating organ, the new machine would propel blood through the body at a steady pace so that its recipients will have no heartbeat at all. The concept of a pulseless heart is difficult to fathom. Cohn often compares it to the development of the airplane propeller. When people started to develop flying machines, he says, they first tried to emulate the way birds fly -- by flapping the wings aggressively. ""It wasn't until they decided, 'We can't do this the way Mother Nature did,' and came up with the rapidly spinning propeller that the Wright Brothers were able to fly,"" Cohn says. The idea of an artificial heart goes back decades. Frazier began medical school in what he describes as ""the Kennedy Era."" ""We were going to the moon; we were going to achieve world peace,"" and Frazier wanted to develop the first artificial heart. In 1968, he left for Vietnam as a flight surgeon. Thirteen months later, his helicopter was shot down, and he nearly died. ""That experience convinced me I should stick to something more meaningful for the rest of my life."" That he did. The veteran surgeon, inventor and researcher has devoted the last half century to developing technologies to fix or replace the human heart, the most notable of which is the newest generation of continuous flow Left Ventricular Assist Devices, known as LVADs. Modeled after an Archimedes Screw, a machine that raises water to fill irrigation ditches, the continuous flow LVAD is a pump that helps failing hearts push additional blood through the body with a rapidly spinning impeller. Today, the continuous flow LVAD has been implanted in 20,000 people worldwide, including former Vice President Dick Cheney before he received a heart transplant nearly two years later. In some cases, the LVAD's turbine has essentially taken over the pumping process entirely from the biological heart. In these instances, the implant recipient barely has any pulse at all. Observing what happened in these patients led Frazier to one compelling question: If the LVAD can take over for a weakened heart, could it replace the organ entirely? In 2004, Frazier asked Cohn to collaborate on a new research project. Cohn's interest in heart surgery dates back to when he was a young boy reading articles about world-renowned heart surgeons Dr. Michael E. Debakey and Dr. Denton Cooley, who developed and played a role in the transplant of the first artificial heart in a human in 1969. Now the holder of some 70-odd U.S. patents, Cohn says his work with Frazier to build an artificial heart is the most ambitious project of his career. The surgeons set out to combine two LVADs to replicate the functions of the heart's right and left ventricles. Using two commercially available LVAD turbines, Frazier and Cohn combined the devices with plastics and other material used for implants: hernia mesh, Dacron cardiovascular patches and medical silicone. Everything met FDA standards, but Cohn describes the final product as ""rather kludged together."" The surgeons tested their invention by installing it in around 70 calves. All of the cows produced a flat line on an EKG, which measures heart electrical activity, yet they stood, ate and walked around, paying seemingly no notice to a small technicality: They had no heartbeat. In order for the FDA to approve the device for clinical trials, the calves needed to live for at least one month. Cohn and Frazier's device trumped these standards, with many calves living healthily for full 90-day studies. Cohn and Frazier were encouraged, and in March 2011, put their artificial heart into a human patient. Craig Lewis, 55, was admitted to the Texas Heart Institute with amyloidosis, a rare autoimmune disease that fills internal organs with a viscous protein that causes rapid heart, kidney and liver failure. Without some intervention, Lewis would have been dead in days. Frazier and Cohn decided it was the right moment to test their device and the surgeons undertook the lengthy procedure. Less than 48 hours later, Lewis was sitting up, talking and using his laptop. When doctors put the stethoscope to Lewis's heart, all they heard was a steady whir of what sounded like a boat propeller. Lewis survived for six weeks until his failing kidneys and liver got the best of him and his family asked doctors to unplug the device. Lewis's case proved what Frazier and Cohn had dreamed of for nearly half a century: Humans can indeed survive without a pulse. But there are some potential downsides to having a heart that doesn't beat. Michael Garippa, CEO of the first-ever FDA approved mechanical artificial heart, the Syncardia, says beating ""up the blood in a blender"" can activate internal bleeding in other organs. Gastrointestinal bleeding and strokes are a high risk for patients on other heart assist devices, he says. Cohn describes the Syncardia, which has been transplanted in nearly 1,300 people to date as a ""brilliant and elegant device,"" but the device is for short-term use only and is cumbersome. Patients ""have to carry around a compressor and have two air hoses going in and out of your chest."" Frazier and Cohn see a pulseless device as the only compromise to develop an artificial heart that is both efficient and long-term. Two years ago, Daniel Timms, a 35-year-old Australian biomedical engineer, made an Australian government funded trip to Houston, stumbling through the door of Cohn's office at the Texas Heart Institute. Timms was wearing blue jeans and a T-shirt and carrying a heart device he had been working on for the past 10 years in his backpack. Cohn was skeptical at first: ""A lot of people come to our door with devices and prototypes, and they range from moderately interesting to laughably stupid. ... My expectations were very low. He pulls this thing out and starts telling me about it, and I quickly realized this is the most sophisticated and elegant device I've ever seen."" Made up of one moving part that rotates within a can-like exterior no bigger than a fist, the device has a large and small blade on opposing sides of the rotor. The small blade pushes blood through the heart's right chamber, to the lungs, and the larger blade pumps out blood through the left chamber to the rest of the body. What fascinated the two surgeons most was that the device operates by being suspended in a powerful magnetic field, which prevents the wear and tear common in technology designed for pumping blood. Two magnetic fields also control the blades' oscillations, which each rotate an average of 2,000 times a minute depending on whether a person is standing, sitting up, exercising or coughing. Stats show CPR often falls flat . The excitement over the technology drew a $2.4 million donation from Houston furniture store owner, James Mackingvale, allowing Timms and a team of seven researchers from Australia, Germany, Japan and Brazil to relocate to Houston in January to collaborate with the Texas Heart Institute. Timms' group also brought a 3-D printer, which enables the medical staff to quickly make its own parts for the artificial heart. Within days, the doctors can print a new part that pumps the blood and then can evaluate its performance, a process that once took months. In July, the doctors even tried a plastic 3-D printed version on a calf. The calf survived for a number of days and was able to move around. They're now working on a titanium version of the device as a prototype for a more durable technology. Once that device is developed, they will begin animal testing, measuring the results to determine whether the technology is ready to propose implanting into terminally ill human patients.

"Newport, Wales (CNN) -- NATO members agreed Friday to form a ""spearhead"" force of several thousand land troops ready to deploy within a few days, NATO chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen said, as the trans-Atlantic alliance grapples with the threats posed by Russia's interference in Ukraine and the rise of ISIS in Syria and Iraq . The troops would be backed by air, sea and special forces support, he said, with a command and control center and extra equipment in Eastern Europe. ""This decision sends a clear message: NATO protects all allies at all times,"" Rasmussen said on the second day of a NATO summit in Newport, Wales. ""And it sends a clear message to any potential aggressor: Should you even think of attacking one ally, you will be facing the whole alliance."" The new readiness action plan, which includes proposals for more short notice exercises, is intended to help NATO respond swiftly to Russian aggression and other international conflicts. ""In these turbulent times, NATO must be prepared to undertake the full range of missions and to defend allies against the full range of threats,"" Rasmussen said. He said NATO members also ""stand ready to assist Iraq"" in its fight against Islamist extremists if Baghdad asks for help. But pressed by reporters on exactly what aid NATO would offer, Rasmussen toned down his remarks, saying NATO is prepared to consider a ""defense capability building mission"" in Iraq. President Barack Obama said Friday that ""there's great conviction that we have to act as part of the international community to degrade"" and ultimately destroy ISIS jihadists that pose a long-term threat to member countries. The United States has sent military advisers to Iraq to help that country combat ISIS. Canada -- a NATO member -- said Friday it also will send ""several dozen"" troops to Iraq to help advise that country's government on fighting ISIS, Prime Minister Stephen Harper's office said. Responses to threats posed by Russia's interference in Ukraine and the rise of ISIS in Syria and Iraq were at the heart of discussions of the alliance's meeting in Wales. Obama rebuffs Russian warnings on NATO, Ukraine . Russia's annexation of Crimea and involvement in the unrest in eastern Ukraine have alarmed NATO members such as Poland and the Baltic States. A rapid-reaction force would give those nations more security amid Moscow's deteriorating relationship with the West. U.S. officials have stressed that any force would be defensive in posture and not a provocation to Russia. Obama said Friday at the end of the summit that ""Russia's aggression against Ukraine threatens our vision of a Europe that is whole, free and at peace."" He also rebuffed Russian warnings against NATO membership for Ukraine, saying membership in the alliance remains ""open to nations that meet our high standards."" The comments echoed Rasmussen's earlier remarks. ""No third party has a veto"" on new members joining NATO, Rasmussen said. Also Friday, Prime Minister David Cameron said the United Kingdom would be willing to contribute 3,500 personnel to the new NATO force. Edward Lucas, a senior editor at The Economist in London, said it's important to get a rapid-reaction force ""that is pre-authorized, a bit like a pre-authorized credit card, so that if there is a crisis, it can be deployed very quickly by NATO military commanders."" Otherwise, activation of the force could get bogged down in political discussions, Lucas told CNN. Greater spending . The allied nations also agreed to work toward increasing defense spending over the next decade as part of their NATO commitments, Rasmussen said. The goal: 2% of gross domestic product, 20% of which will go toward equipment, over the next decade. The Ukraine crisis is a major reason for the decision, he said. While he said Russia has increased defense spending by 50% in the last five years, NATO nations have cut back on average 20%. ""Russian aggression against Ukraine is a wake-up call, and I think this is exactly what has led capitals in NATO allied nations to reconsider defense investments,"" Rasmussen said. ""Because it is now obvious that we cannot take our security for granted, and we will have to invest more in our defense and security."" The recent revival of a Russian threat in Eastern Europe has upended some of the assumptions that had underpinned NATO's earlier expansion in the region. ""This is the first time since the end of World War II that one European country has tried to grab another's territory by force,"" Rasmussen said Thursday. ""Europe must not turn away from the rule of law to the rule of strongest."" Lucas pointed out that when NATO first brought Eastern European countries such as Poland and Hungary into its fold in the late 1990s, it decided to regard Russia as a friend rather than a threat, forgoing plans to defend the new member states. ""The whole idea was that NATO would be in partnership with Russia to deal with other security issues,"" he said. ""That's changed because Russia didn't like that arrangement. Russia has bullied its neighbors."" Opinion: NATO's moment of truth on Ukraine . CNN's Nic Robertson reported from Newport, while Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong and Laura Smith-Spark from London.","NEW: NATO allies agree they must work together to degrade and destroy ISIS, Obama says .

"(CNN) -- Apple has refreshed its line of MacBook Air notebooks, dropping in more powerful processors and knocking $100 off the price. The 11-inch Air, with 128GB of storage, now sells for $899 and options range up to a 13-inch screen with 256GB of storage for $1,199. The new versions of the computers, which Apple announced Tuesday, contain fourth-generation Intel Core i5 and Core i7 processors. Apple says the new processors work with its OS X Mavericks operating system to provide 12 hours of battery life on the 13-inch models and 9 hours on the 11-inch MacBook Airs. A more radical overhaul of the popular laptop line is expected later this year. Apple-centric blog 9to5Mac is reporting that Apple is developing a hybrid, 12-inch MacBook Air that would perform like the larger, more powerful model while being almost as portable as the current 11-inch Air. In the meantime, the company appears to be addressing one of the common gripes from the anti-Apple crowd -- that more powerful PCs can be had for a fraction of the cost of Apple's laptop and desktop offerings. ""With MacBook Air starting at $899, there's no reason to settle for anything less than a Mac,"" Phil Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of marketing, said in a written statement. ""Macs have never been more popular, and today we've boosted the performance and lowered the price of MacBook Air so even more people can experience the perfect everyday notebook."" The new models are now available online, in Apple's retail stores and at select authorized retailers.","Apple on Tuesday rolled out new MacBook Air laptops with faster processors .

"(CNN) -- Finding a ""smoking gun"" linking Iraq and al Qaeda became the main purpose of the abusive interrogation program the Bush administration authorized in 2002, a former State Department official told CNN on Thursday. Dick Cheney's office ordered use of ""alternative"" techniques against CIA's recommendations, aide says. The allegation was included in an online broadside aimed at former Vice President Dick Cheney by Lawrence Wilkerson, chief of staff for then-Secretary of State Colin Powell. In it, Wilkerson wrote that the interrogation program began in April and May of 2002, and then-Vice President Cheney's office kept close tabs on the questioning. ""Its principal priority for intelligence was not aimed at preempting another terrorist attack on the U.S. but discovering a smoking gun linking Iraq and al Qaeda,"" Wilkerson wrote in The Washington Note, an online political journal. Wilkerson, a retired Army colonel, said his accusation is based on information from current and former officials. He said he has been ""relentlessly digging"" since 2004, when Powell asked him to look into the scandal surrounding the treatment of prisoners at Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison. ""I couldn't walk into a courtroom and prove this to anybody, but I'm pretty sure it's fairly accurate,"" he told CNN. Most of Wilkerson's online essay criticizes Cheney's recent defense of the ""alternative"" interrogation techniques the Bush administration authorized for use against suspected terrorists. Cheney has argued the interrogation program was legal and effective in preventing further attacks on Americans. Critics say the tactics amounted to the illegal torture of prisoners in U.S. custody and have called for investigations of those who authorized them. Representatives of the former vice president declined comment on Wilkerson's allegations. But Wilkerson told CNN that by early 2002, U.S. officials had decided that ""we had al Qaeda pretty much on the run."" ""The priority had turned to other purposes, and one of those purposes was to find substantial contacts between al Qaeda and Baghdad,"" he said. The argument that Iraq could have provided weapons of mass destruction to terrorists such as al Qaeda was a key element of the Bush administration's case for the March 2003 invasion. But after the invasion, Iraq was found to have dismantled its nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programs, and the independent commission that investigated the 2001 attacks found no evidence of a collaborative relationship between the two entities. Wilkerson wrote that in one case, the CIA told Cheney's office that a prisoner under its interrogation program was now ""compliant,"" meaning agents recommended the use of ""alternative"" techniques should stop. At that point, ""The VP's office ordered them to continue the enhanced methods,"" Wilkerson wrote. ""The detainee had not revealed any al Qaeda-Baghdad contacts yet. This ceased only after Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi, under waterboarding in Egypt, 'revealed' such contacts."" Al-Libi's claim that Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's government had trained al Qaeda operatives in producing chemical and biological weapons appeared in the October 2002 speech then-President Bush gave when pushing Congress to authorize military action against Iraq. It also was part of Powell's February 2003 presentation to the United Nations on the case for war, a speech Powell has called a ""blot"" on his record. Al-Libi later recanted the claim, saying it was made under torture by Egyptian intelligence agents, a claim Egypt denies. He died last week in a Libyan prison, reportedly a suicide, Human Rights Watch reported. Stacy Sullivan, a counterterrorism adviser for the U.S.-based group, called al-Libi's allegation ""pivotal"" to the Bush administration's case for war, as it connected Baghdad to the terrorist organization behind the 2001 attacks on New York and Washington. And an Army psychiatrist assigned to support questioning of suspected terrorists at the Guantanamo Bay prison camp in Cuba told the service's inspector-general that interrogators there were trying to connect al Qaeda and Iraq. ""This is my opinion,"" Maj. Paul Burney told the inspector-general's office. ""Even though they were giving information and some of it was useful, while we were there a large part of the time we were focused on trying to establish a link between aI Qaeda and Iraq and we were not being successful in establishing a link between aI Qaeda and Iraq. The more frustrated people got in not being able to establish this link ... there was more and more pressure to resort to measures that might produce more immediate results."" Burney's account was included in a Senate Armed Services Committee report released in April. Other interrogators reported pressure to produce intelligence ""but did not recall pressure to identify links between Iraq and al Qaeda,"" the Senate report states. Cheney criticized Powell during a television interview over the weekend, saying he no longer considers Powell a fellow Republican after his former colleague endorsed Democratic candidate Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election. Wilkerson said he is not speaking for his former boss and does not know whether Powell shares his views.","Lawrence Wilkerson criticizes Dick Cheney for defending interrogation methods .

"Dallas (CNN) -- Corey Knowlton is on edge sitting inside a Las Vegas hotel room, surrounded by a private security detail, explaining why he spent $350,000 for the chance to hunt a black rhinoceros in the southern African nation of Namibia. ""If I sound emotional, it's because I have people threatening my kids,"" Knowlton told CNN. ""It's because I have people threatening to kill me right now [that] I'm having to talk to the FBI and have private security to keep my children from being skinned alive and shot at."" Knowlton was outed over social media as the winner of the Dallas Safari Club's auction for a black rhino hunting permit from the Namibian government last weekend. It didn't take long for the threats and vitriol to start pouring in. ""You are a BARBARIAN. People like you need to be the innocent that are hunted,"" posted one woman on Knowlton's Facebook page. Some sounded even more sinister. ""I find you and I will KILL you,"" read another threat. ""I have friends who live in the area and will have you in there sights also,"" wrote another commenter. Kenya implanting microchips in rhinos to fight poaching . ""A hunter afraid of being hunted?! How do you think the rhino feels idiot?"" responded one woman to Knowlton's fears. Despite the backlash, Knowlton has decided to engage the raging debate over how to protect an endangered species, such as the black rhino, by putting down his own money to help save the species and raise awareness about wildlife conservation. ""I respect the black rhino,"" said Knowlton. ""A lot of people say, 'Do you feel like a bigger man?' or 'Is this a thrill for you?' The thrill is knowing that we are preserving wildlife resources, not for the next generation, but for eons."" Knowlton, 35, is a Dallas-based hunting consultant for The Hunting Consortium, an international guide service. He's also the co-host of a hunting show on The Outdoor Channel called ""Jim Shockey's The Professionals."" Knowlton's online biography says he's hunted more than 120 species on almost every continent. Hunting has long been a passion of his -- Knowlton said he started hunting as a young boy. He said he grew up poor, but made a good living in oil production. ""I'm a hunter. I want to experience a black rhino. I want to be there and be a part of it. I believe in the cycle of life. I don't believe that meat, you know, comes from the grocery store. I believe that animal died and I respect it,"" Knowlton said Thursday night on CNN's ""Piers Morgan Live."" He describes himself as a passionate conservationist and desperately wants to explain to his critics why hunting one old black rhino can help save critically endangered species around the world. He knows it's a difficult conversation full of scathing-hot emotion. Humane Society: We'll block his trophy . The Humane Society opposed the Dallas Safari Club Auction and says it plans to fight Knowlton's efforts to bring the black rhino trophy into the United States. If Knowlton does hunt and kill the black rhino, he'll need a special permit from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to import the animal into the country under the Endangered Species Act. Wayne Pacelle, president and CEO of The Humane Society, wrote in an online blog post that killing one endangered animal to save the species is an ""Orwellian idea"" and worries that it will inspire hunters to pay millions of dollars for the chance to kill orangutans, elephants or tigers. ""Where will it end?"" wrote Pacelle. ""The first rule of protecting the rarest animals in the world is to protect each living member of that species."" Helicopters versus drones: The cost of the war on rhinos . But Knowlton argues that, in this instance, killing one black rhino will protect the species throughout Namibia and that this idea is supported by scientists and conservationists around the world. Of the world's approximately 5,000 black rhinos, about 1,700 are in Namibia. Knowlton says the Namibian government has identified a handful of black rhinos that can be hunted. These are animals that are old, no longer capable of breeding and are considered a dangerous threat to other younger animals. He said the threat to the rhino is from its own kind. ""One of the other ear-tagged killer rhinos is going to injure it. And then either lions or hyenas are going to drag it down. It's going to die [in] a horrible manner, slowly."" So Knowlton argues, why not let a hunter pay a massive amount of money to take out a threat to the rest of the species. The Dallas Safari Club says the $350,000 paid by Knowlton will be donated to the Namibian government's black rhino conservation efforts. ""As much as I would love them all to live forever, they are going to die,"" said Knowlton. ""The older males are killing each other, and something has to be done about it."" Knowlton's supporters: Science backs him up . Knowlton's supporters say this conservation strategy is based in smart science. The International Union for Conservation of Nature supported the Dallas Safari Club's black rhino hunting permit auction. The union says its mission is to work with governments and conservation groups around the world to find ""practical solutions"" to conservation efforts around the world. It also says ""trophy hunting is a fundamental pillar of Namibia's conservation approach and instrumental in its success."" And that ""well-managed recreational hunting and trophy hunting"" have had a positive impact in ""stimulating population increases for rhino."" But other animal rights organizations have criticized this conservation strategy and argue that the better focus would be eco-tourism, raising money from people willing to pay to see endangered animals up close in the wild. Knowlton says the intense and controversial publicity leading up to the Dallas Safari Club auction scared several serious bidders away. Knowlton said going into the auction there were about 10 serious bidders, but by the time the bidding started, that number had dwindled to about three. ""It was the most unfortunate thing. There were people willing to spend $500,000 to a million dollars,"" said Knowlton. ""After what I'm going through now, I understand why they decided not to do it."" Knowlton says he does not yet when he'll schedule his hunting expedition to Namibia. A great deal of planning and preparation must be done, he said. Knowlton wants to preserve the black rhino's hide and then donate the rhino meat to needy communities in Namibia. ""I speak with my heart. I'm passionate about this,"" said Knowlton. ""I think with the money that I contributed, with everything that is at stake and everything there is to be gained by the world to learn about sustainable use, I think this could be the greatest experience of my life."" Knowlton says if the hunt doesn't go perfectly it could also be one of the worst experiences of his life. ""I don't think it makes me a bigger man; I actually think, Piers, I think it could make me a dead man,"" he told CNN's Morgan. ""This is probably the most dangerous situation that I'll ever be in outside of walking around right now with all the people that want to kill me."" Gallery: 20 years of photographing in Africa .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- About 35 American activists dressed in pink are expected to take part in a demonstration Friday in Islamabad against U.S. drone strikes that target militants in Pakistan. The U.S. protesters, from the anti-war group Code Pink, are visiting Pakistan to make contact with people affected by the drone strikes and draw the attention of the American public to the situation in areas where the attacks take place. ""We are here to say, on behalf of those Americans with a conscience, that we apologize to the people of Pakistan for the killing and suffering"" caused by the drones, Medea Benjamin, one of the founders of Code Pink, said at a news conference Thursday in Islamabad. Organized in conjunction with a British advocacy group, the rally Friday is scheduled to take place in one of the Pakistani capital's busiest market places. The protesters say they plan to wear bright pink clothes, carry banners and recite anti-drone chants. The drone strike program in Pakistan has long been controversial, with conflicting reports on its impact from the U.S. government, Pakistani officials and independent organizations. American officials insist that the choice and execution of the strikes -- begun under former President George W. Bush and ramped up under President Barack Obama -- meet strict standards and that cases of civilian deaths or injuries are extremely rare. But a study released last month by Stanford Law School and New York University's School of Law said the drone attacks had killed far more people than the United States acknowledges, traumatized innocent residents and been largely ineffective. Civilians account for a significant portion of those killed, the study said. The drone program is deeply unpopular in Pakistan, where the national parliament voted in April to end any authorization for it. Code Pink's demonstration Friday in Islamabad is the precursor to a bigger, more ambitious protest over drone strikes in which the group plans to participate over the weekend. The activists say they hope to join cricket-star-turned-politician Imran Khan and his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, in a march to South Waziristan, part of Pakistan's ungoverned tribal region along the Afghanistan border where drone strikes are frequent. But the activists say they are unsure if the Pakistani government will allow them to take part in the march to the restive region. The neighboring district, North Waziristan, is widely believed to be the headquarters of the Haqqani network -- a militant group Washington has long accused of fueling some of the deadliest attacks against NATO troops in Afghanistan. If the authorities prevent them from participating in the march to South Waziristan, the Code Pink activists say they will invite people from the area affected by the drone strikes to join them in a large gathering in Islamabad. They say they are also considering the possibility of a hunger strike outside the U.S. Embassy in the capital. Code Pink says on its website that the broader goal of its Pakistan trip is to ""stop the drone strikes and get compensation for the families of civilians killed by the strikes."" It has held meetings in Islamabad this week with victims of the strikes and U.S. officials. The women-led organization became known for antiwar demonstrations in Washington during the U.S. buildup in Iraq. The group has held protests over a range of different international issues. Code Pink has regularly disrupted high-profile congressional hearings dealing with war and national defense issues, as well as interrupting speeches by foreign officials like Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel. Among the activists with the Code Pink delegation in Pakistan at the moment is Ann Wright, a former U.S. Army colonel and State Department official who quit her post to protest the U.S. invasion of Iraq. In an appearance this week on the Pakistani television station Geo TV, Wright said that U.S. drone strikes are a violation of Pakistan's sovereignty and are fueling anti-American sentiment in the region. When the Pakistani television host asked Wright to respond to accusations that she was a radical activist, she said jokingly, ""I'm a radical peace activist."" CNN's Shaan Khan reported from Islamabad, and Jethro Mullen from Hong Kong. CNN's Reza Sayah contributed to this report.","NEW: An activist says the group is in Pakistan to apologize for ""the killing and suffering""

"(CNN) -- He has a face only a mother could love -- a mother who lives 1,000 to 3,000 feet under water and voraciously feeds on live squid and fish. We're talking about a goblin shark -- only the second member of his species ever caught in the Gulf of Mexico, and the first since 2000, shark expert John Carlson said. ""Beauty is in the eye of the beholder,"" Carlson, a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration research biologist said. ""Some would call them 'ugly.' I think, 'interesting.'"" Carl Moore, 63, of Townsend, Georgia, was the unlikely archeologist of this ichthyological wonder, which he estimates was 18 to 20 feet long. He caught it on April 19, about halfway through an 18-day fishing trip. Carlson guesses it was closer to 15 feet, with the largest goblin shark ever measuring 18 feet. Moore decided an exact appraisal wasn't in his best interest. ""I was going to take the tape measure, then he flashed around again. I said, 'Forget the measurement. That thing'll eat me up!'"" Moore has been shrimping the Atlantic and the Gulf for 50 years, with a short break for a stint in the Air Force, and he's ""caught so much weird stuff: sawfish, Bahamian anglefish, loggerback turtles weighing 1,000 to 1,500 pounds."" But when the goblin shark spilled out of his trawling net full of royal red shrimp, Moore felt ""disbelief."" ""First thing I told them boys was, 'Man, he's ugly! Looks prehistoric to me,'"" Moore said. Goblin sharks do resemble some prehistoric species, and Carlson said Moore made a ""pretty important find."" They're not seen anywhere all that often, though the coast of Japan boasts the shark's share of recorded sightings. ""We don't know a lot about deep water fauna,"" Carlson said. ""We know little about (goblin sharks) -- how long they live, how fast they grow."" One thing that's fairly certain: At their size, goblin sharks have few natural predators, according to Carlson. The photographs Moore provided to NOAA will help expand that knowledge. Carlson said he and a colleague now are writing a paper on goblin sharks to submit to a scientific journal. And Carlson can thank a 3-year-old boy for that. Moore just recently began carrying a camera with him on his shrimping expeditions. He wants to share pictures of what he does with his grandson Keaton, who turns 4 on Wednesday. Moore released the shark after getting photographic evidence of his -- and just about anyone's -- greatest fish story ever. ""Anything that's alive we try to put back in the ocean,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- If you are pregnant, ask your doctor questions about their delivery habits long before you go into labor. Several studies now suggest doctors may be performing too many cesarean sections. Doctors may be performing them based more out of habit, training, expediency or worry about lawsuits than out of medical necessity, according to the studies. A surgical birth, while generally safe, does carry more health risks and more expense. If a woman has a C-section once, it also increases the chances she'll need another if she gets pregnant again. Risks go up with each procedure. The latest information comes from Consumer Reports. The nonprofit ranked hospitals based on the number of C-sections performed at each. Looking at hospital billing records the authors found the number of procedures performed vary wildly -- even at hospitals in the same town. In Texas, for instance, 15% of births at El Paso's University Medical Center are C-sections; four miles away, at Sierra Medical Center, the rate is more than double that at 37%. The Denver Health Medical Center earned Consumer Report's highest rating for low rate of C-sections. Doctors delivered 8% of babies by C-section; at Denver's Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center, by comparison, 20% of the low-risk deliveries were C-sections. The report looked at more than 1,500 hospitals in 22 states. Not all states make such information available -- something Consumer Reports said it hopes will change. Overall, 66% of the hospitals in the report earned the organization's lowest or second-lowest rating for a high rate of C-sections. Only 12% got either of the organization's top scores for a low rate. Nation gets ""C"" for preterm birth rates . ""The variation is what gets you, that really is the thing,"" said Doris Peter, director of Consumer Reports' Health Ratings Center. ""If you compare peer hospitals in urban areas that treat the same kind of patients -- meaning they share similar socioeconomic issues -- to have wildly different rates suggests that there is a problem here."" Sometimes C-sections are medically necessary, meaning either the life of the mother or her fetus would be endangered by a vaginal birth. But several studies found surgical births are being performed for low-risk pregnancies, too. C-sections are generally considered safe, compared with vaginal births, but the surgery carries risks, including infection, increased bleeding, reactions to anesthesia and blood clots, according to the Mayo Clinic. The rates vary regionally as well, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More C-sections are performed in the South compared with the Mountain States, the West Coast and the Upper Midwest, which tend to have the lowest rates. The South does have higher diabetes and obesity rates. Both lead to more medically challenged deliveries, as does the mother's age. The older she is, the more complications she may have. Overall nearly one out of three women now give birth by C-section, according to the CDC. That number has made medical associations uncomfortable. Making note of other studies that look at regional variations in surgical birth rates, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine issued guidelines in March. These are intended to help doctors make more informed decisions about which mothers need C-sections. The high number of surgical births, plus the fact that fewer women or children die these days during the childbirth process, ""raises significant concern that cesarean delivery is overused,"" according to the recommendations. Definition of ""term"" pregnancy changing . Dr. Aaron Caughey, lead author of the report and recommendations, said he hopes these guidelines will raise awareness about this issue. ""Over the next five years, I would hope we will see a slow decline in the rate,"" Caughey said. But it ""will be contingent on more people embracing the message and will have to involve people at the grass-roots level doing things in their practice that changes this trend."" The medical community started to see the number of C-sections going up during the 1970s when there was an increase in the ability to monitor the fetus' heartbeat. ""We didn't always know precisely how to interpret the data,"" Caughey said, adding at the time there was a ""general abandonment of more aggressive vaginal deliveries."" The medical community still needs better research on fetal heart rates, he said. Monitoring the heart rate can tell a doctor if a fetus is in distress. Doctors also do C-sections if they believe labor is ""going on too long,"" according to the recommendations. However, that decision may be based on outdated research, according to Consumer Reports and other studies. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine do recommend that ""normal"" labor should be a longer process than initially thought, and concluded doctors ""should be more patient in the first and second phase of labor."" Doctors should not induce labor unless ""it's an absolute medical necessity,"" according to the recommendations. Encouraging a woman to give birth before her body is ready increases the likelihood she'll need a surgical birth. Doctors often perform C-sections if there is a possibility the baby will be large. The new guidelines said that may not always be warranted. A baby should be more than 11 pounds before inducing labor. ""Everyone can do better,"" Caughey said. Consumer Reports' Peter agrees, saying that the women she talks to often don't know the extra health risks of having a C-section. The best and worst place to give birth . ""We want to get a dialogue going,"" Peter said. ""We want the patient to go to her doctor and say, 'I'd like for us to find ways to avoid a C-section if possible.' Find a doctor that meets your needs in all practice patterns."" Most doctors likely will not know the number of C-sections they perform, Caughey said. Even if a doctor does know it, the rate of the surgical deliveries they perform still may not give patients the perspective they would need. A doctor doing general rounds, for instance, could have to finish up a procedure another doctor started. Or a doctor could be seeing a disproportionately older, heavier and sicker population, which would affect his or her rates of C-sections. Caughey suggests women ask doctors about their general philosophy on C-sections. ""I think a healthy dialogue is always important for any kind of medical care,"" he said.","C-section rates vary wildly among hospitals, Consumer Reports finds .

"(CNN) -- A gas station clerk's smartphone may have saved his life Monday by blocking a bullet fired at his chest in an attempted armed robbery. The shooting happened after a man entered the store at the Hess gas station in Winter Garden, Florida, early Friday and asked a clerk to help him find a particular beverage. The man then pulled out a revolver and demanded that the clerk open the safe, CNN affiliate WESH reported, but the clerk was unable to get the safe door open. Another clerk then entered the store and was also ordered to open the safe. After both the store workers' efforts to open it failed, the man fired a single gunshot as he left the store, WESH reported, citing police. Emergency services workers were called to the store, and as they were interviewing one of the clerks, he complained of chest pains. ""So they started looking at the clerk. That's when they realized that the guy had actually shot at him, hit him, struck his cell phone, and the cell phone had stopped his bullet,"" Winter Garden Police Lt. Scott Allen said. The chest pains were caused by the impact of the bullet on the cell phone, which was in the clerk's chest pocket, according to WESH. He didn't suffer any other injuries and was quickly released after being checked at a hospital, the TV station said. His HTC smartphone came off worse. A photo showed its screen shattered around a hole where the bullet had lodged. ""I've seen individuals get shot with low-caliber handguns and I've seen it be life ending. So, for this gentleman to be as lucky as he is, it's a good day for us,"" Allen said. The other clerk was reported to be unharmed. Police described the suspect in the attack as a black man about 6 feet tall wearing a dark-colored hooded sweatshirt, pants, sunglasses, a bright yellow traffic vest and white gloves, according to WESH. He remained on the loose Monday evening, it reported. Authorities aren't disclosing the name of the clerk who was shot, the TV station reported.","A man attempts to rob a gas station in Winter Garden, Florida .

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- U.S. President Barack Obama on Tuesday authorized additional troops be deployed to Iraq to protect American diplomatic facilities and personnel in Baghdad. The 350 troops are being sent at the request of the U.S. Department of State to beef up security, an appeal that comes as the violence mounts as Iraqi security forces battle ISIS fighters and their Sunni militant allies. ""The request he approved today will allow some previously deployed military personnel to depart Iraq, while at the same time providing a more robust, sustainable security force for our personnel and facilities in Baghdad,"" according to a statement released by the White House. The new troops will bring the number of American troops in Iraq to well over 1,000, with most serving either as diplomatic security or military advisers to Iraq's security forces. Even as the Pentagon and the White House stressed the new troops were not being sent to Iraq in a combat role, they will be arriving at a critical time. Iraqi forces, aided by U.S. military airstrikes, have begun to make gains against ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State. Obama: ISIS killers will not intimidate U.S. U.S. airstrikes hit ISIS targets . The strikes destroyed or damaged what the Pentagon described as 16 ISIS armed vehicles near the Mosul Dam, which was retaken last month by Iraqi and Kurdish forces. Obama authorized targeted airstrikes last month to protect U.S. personnel in Iraq -- including military advisers -- as well as minorities being brutalized by ISIS. The additional U.S. troops will include ""a headquarters element, medical personnel, associated helicopters and an air liaison team and helicopter crews,"" Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby said. ""This action was taken at the recommendation of the Department of Defense after an extensive interagency review and is part of the President's commitment to protect our personnel and facilities in Iraq as we continue to support the government of Iraq in its fight"" against ISIS. Families of missing soldiers demand answers . Even as the United States beefed up its own security at the Embassy, the families of missing Iraqi security force members stormed Parliament on Tuesday to demand answers about the fate of their loved ones. More than 100 family members clashed with security before entering the building, located in the International Zone, commonly known as the Green Zone. They vandalized the interior and became aggressive with people inside, , a parliamentary official told CNN. They are refusing to leave until their concerns are addressed. The families are angry over the lack of information about the victims of an alleged massacre of Iraqi forces and cadets near Tikrit, when a military base formerly known as Camp Speicher was overrun by ISIS in June. In recent weeks, family members of the recruits have been protesting outside the International Zone. Some have met with lawmakers. They want the bodies of their sons returned to them for burial, and they want the missing to be brought back. The killings at Camp Speicher are among the worst atrocities claimed by ISIS in Iraq. The group, which refers to itself as the ""Islamic State,"" said it killed 1,700 Iraqi forces, but no official figures have been released. A senior health official told CNN at the time that more than 1,000 families have registered that they had sons at the camp. MAPS: Where do jihadis come from?

"(TIME.com) -- You can't smoke in most restaurants and malls, and those laws may be responsible for saving thousands of lives. According to two separate studies, recent laws that limit smoking in public places are contributing to fewer tobacco-related hospital visits and deaths. In 2009, the Institute of Medicine concluded that smoking bans contributed to fewer heart problems in areas where the policies were implemented, but the panel was unable to determine how much benefit the laws provided. The new research provides some objective improvements in lower heart attack rates and adds to a growing body of evidence for the tangible health effects of stricter smoke-free laws across the USA and all around the world. Since 2000, more than half of U.S. states have enacted laws to restrict indoor smoking, and new smoke-free policies have taken hold in countries such as Germany, Bhutan, and Vietnam. Although these regulations are relatively new, researchers are eager to document what effect they have on health; with strong data, public health experts hope that more smoke-free policies will be considered in countries where smoking-related deaths continue to cost nations in health and productivity. TIME.com: Can Asia kick the habit? For one of the two new studies, published in the Archives of Internal Medicine, scientists at Minnesota's Mayo Clinic analyzed effects of smoke-free laws that were introduced in Olmstead County, Minnesota, over the past 10 years. Most of the county's more than 144,000 residents receive health care from the Mayo Clinic, allowing the researchers to obtain consent to track heart-related health outcomes. In 2002, Olmstead County required restaurants to be smoke-free, and a few years later passed even stricter anti-smoking laws, mandating that all workplaces, including bars, become smoke-free in 2007. When they compared the 18-month period before the restaurant ban to the 18-month period directly afterward, the researchers found a per-capita drop of 33% in the number of heart attacks in the county, and a 17% drop in the number of sudden cardiac deaths. The decline occured at the same time that rates of hypertension, diabetes and other heart-disease risk factors either remained constant or increased, suggesting that the effect was primarily attributable to the more rigid smoke-free laws. The study's authors also adjusted for the effect of other community anti-smoking efforts, and the drop in heart attacks remained strongly tied to the new policies. In the second study, published in the journal Circulation, researchers at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) took a different tack. They analyzed the combined the results of 45 previous studies that focused on 33 different smoke-free laws worldwide and their impact on health. TIME.com: How second-hand cigarette smoke changes your genes . Like the study in Olmstead County, the UCSF meta-analysis showed a clear health benefit for regions that go smoke-free. Areas that restrict public smoking saw a prompt and sustained decline in both hospital admissions and deaths from a variety of causes related to smoking, including heart disease, stroke, and many lung conditions. In these regions, the UCSF researchers showed an average decline in heart attack hospitalizations of 15% -- less than the Mayo Clinic study, but, the California authors note, their analysis took an average of hospitalizations; some regions may have benefited from far fewer health effects attributable to smoking, while others saw slighltly less benefit. ""All people should avoid secondhand smoke to the extent possible, and people with coronary heart disease should have no exposure to secondhand smoke,"" the authors of the Mayo Clinic study wrote, noting that many of the heart-related health problems of smoking occur in non-smokers who are exposed to second-hand smoke. They say that their data should support continued expansion of smoke-free laws. TIME.com: Smoking ban? The French light up again in public . Stanton Glantz, director of the Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education at UCSF and the senior study author on the Circulation paper, has argued previously that smoke-free laws work to improve health not only because they protect non-smokers from harmful health effects of secondhand smoke, but they also protect smokers, by discouraging them from smoking as much, or even encouraging them to quit. Despite the growing evidence supporting their health benefits, however, critics of the laws argue that smoking bans limit the freedom of smokers to choose when and where they smoke. Smoke-free advocates often argue, in response, that restrictions are needed to protect the rights of non-smokers to remain tobacco-free -- and to protect the freedom of workers in bars and restaurants to avoid the potential health fall-out from their customers' risky habits. The new evidence isn't likely to settle this thorny debate over personal freedoms, but, the authors hope, the results may sway more lawmakers to take the negative health effects of smoking more seriously in protecting public health. Heart disease remains the country's leading killer, and a policy that limits its toll can be hard to ignore. This story was initially published on TIME.com.

"(CNN) -- Ordinarily, being ranked as the worst modern president of the United States would be considered unfortunate. For you Mr. President, that's the good news. As painful as it is to note, your presidency has not yet hit bottom. You've got a long way to go in your descent. Everywhere you walk, Mr. President, the world unravels. Americans are whispering that each political missile you fire seems to hit not its target but our own house. You have undone the core idea you've advanced, that a larger public sector can save us. You are becoming the one-man Keystone Cops of an experiment in weakness and incompetent government. Your Veterans Administration is a dysfunctional mess. Some veterans who have lived through war have not survived contact with your VA. Your immigration agents are changing diapers and crying for fresh underwear for detained immigrants awaiting deportation. Your IRS has been accused of targeting political opponents, and your best defense is their ineptitude: They lose their e-mails and files. Your own signature initiative, the Affordable Care Act, has turned on you. You've repeatedly delayed and altered the law, gluing and taping together, on the fly, the health care of an anxious nation. Begala: What's behind Boehner's nutty lawsuit threat . Your Supreme Court is telling you to read the manual that came with your office: You are not allowed to run a Nixonian presidency. In three years, you've suffered numerous humiliating and unanimous reversals of your executive authority. You are protected by the thinly manned barricades of an attorney general who refuses to investigate misconduct in your executive offices. Four out of five Americans believe the government you would like to expand is corrupt, a view that is a 7-point increase from the last year of the Bush administration. You are fortunate you cannot be impeached because of the cost to our exhausted, divided country. If you were a car manufactured by GM, not the president who bailed it out, you would be recalled for your defects. In foreign affairs, you have undone one of the great accomplishments of the 20th century: You have resuscitated the Soviet Union. A two-bit KGB thug named Putin has been kicking sand in the face of your country. In the absence of American leadership, the Middle East has devolved into chaos, and you are reduced to unpalatable choices: Either you negotiate with our Iranian enemies or abandon our allies, if we still have any, to jihadist wildfires that threaten Israel's borders and set desert sands aflame. Boehner: Why we must sue the President . Young people who voted for you to earn a better life than their parents are now living with their parents. Our nation has the lost the hope you promised us. We fear our freedom is in decline: A 48% plurality feel our best days are in the past. Even the one thing you have been good at, Mr. President -- politics -- has abandoned you. You have now been reduced to pathetically small political ""listening tours."" Even on such an inconsequential stage, you are tone-deaf, incapable of striking the right chords: You tell your audiences you are there to tell them that you are listening. You have always been more popular than your policies. Despite your stumbling, we have loved your bright smile and intellectual aura. But now, we are beginning to notice; you laugh too hard at your own jokes. Behind the smile, we see an ego inflated beyond merit. Your intellectual detachment, we now find, was merely cluelessness. The distance between what you've promised and done has grown too large for us to blame anyone else. Kohn: Boehner, do your job instead . Is this as bad as it can get? Actually, no, Mr. President. The road ahead is worse for you. Even your supporters will soon say publicly what we are all thinking privately. In days to come, it will become increasingly cool to snicker and then laugh at your presidency. Disagreement is not the cruelest cut in politics; it is ridicule. Politicians who have survived everything else are done in ultimately by laughter. The gristliest moment for an incumbent is not when voters express their anger. There is respect, even in those dark days. What an incumbent never wants to hear from a voter is pity. Your worst day will be when a voter says, ""Poor President Obama. He's done the best he can."" When that day comes, Mr. President, your favorable rating will crash another 10 points into the basement. Democratic candidates will not only ignore you, as they now do, they will turn on you. Hillary Clinton will betray you. That will start a war within your party as candidates like Elizabeth Warren and Jerry Brown rush to defend you. If they depose the Clintons, mere anarchy will be loosed upon the Democratic world. At this moment, our emperor is naked, but no one has yet said it publicly. That will change soon. When it is too sad to cry about our presidents, America laughs. That's what will really hurt.

"(CNN) -- Just a few years ago things were looking grim in Hollywood for multi-camera sitcoms. Then Los Angeles Times staff writer Martin Miller wrote about the upcoming show, ""Back to You,"" a multi-camera sitcom created by Steven Levitan and Christopher Lloyd, and cautioned that the format could slowly sink into oblivion if the networks didn't see results. ""Pre-premiere chatter helps, but if that doesn't eventually translate into sizable ratings ... the traditional multi-camera manner in which the show is shot could drop in demand to the level of a cord phone,"" he wrote. ""Back to You,"" with Kelsey Grammer and Patricia Heaton, was canceled after just one season in 2008. Levitan and Lloyd eventually went on to create and produce the Emmy award-winning mockumentary-style sitcom, ""Modern Family."" This year however, it appears that the multi-camera format is fighting back. In a recent CNN article about this fall's comedy landscape, TVLine.com's Matt Web Mitovich noted that ""Two and a Half Men,"" ""2 Broke Girls,"" ""New Girl,"" and ""Last Man Standing"" were all Top 10 scripted programs, with ""New Girl"" being the only single-camera comedy out of the group. Out of all of the networks, CBS appears to be aiding the resurgence with five of the eight highly ranked sitcoms, all of which are multi-camera sitcoms. And if you look at Entertainment Weekly's TV Ratings category on its website, you'll see headlines like ""CBS laughs last,"" ""CBS comedy block rules earth"" and ""Comedy lineup scores again for CBS."" There are also a number of new and upcoming multi-camera sitcoms that were introduced this fall and will premiere in 2012. In addition to ""2 Broke Girls,"" there's NBC's ""Whitney"" and ""Are You There, Chelsea?"" (previously ""Are You There Vodka? It's Me Chelsea""), ABC's ""Last Man Standing"" and ""Work It,"" and Fox's ""I Hate My Teenage Daughter."" Does this mean that multi-camera comedies are making a comeback with audiences? For those who are not aware of the differences, here's a basic explanation; according to the book ""Writing Television Sitcoms"" by Evan Scott Smith, multi-camera sitcoms ""shoot mostly on a limited number of sets in an indoor soundstage"" and tend to use more than one camera to ""simultaneously cover several angles as the scene plays out."" Single-camera sitcoms, on the other hand, use just one camera to ""shoot on both standing sets and a variety of off-the-lot locations."" Multi-camera sitcoms also ""are usually cheaper to produce and take less time to shoot."" Jen Grisanti, a story consultant and a writing instructor for NBC's Writers on the Verge, said that the multi-camera format has gained momentum again because of better writing in shows like ""2 Broke Girls,"" ""The Big Bang Theory"" and ""Two and a Half Men."" ""Multi-cameras are definitely resurfacing,"" she said. ""You definitely see writers take risks. The multi-camera sitcom is now recognizing the value of a story mixed in with the joke."" Scott Sedita, an acting coach and author of the book ""The Eight Characters of Comedy: Guide to Sitcom Acting and Writing"" said that the multi-camera sitcom's automatic invitation to laugh makes it much more accessible to everyone. ""I love multi-camera sitcoms,"" he said. ""I want to know when the joke is coming. It's easier and more fun to watch. And in a time of recession, I really believe that people want to sit down and laugh about their lives."" Single-camera sitcoms like ""The Office,"" ""Parks and Recreation"" and ""Modern Family"" incorporate cinematic techniques and allow producers to film outside the studio. That realistic quality and the lack of the laugh track, Sedita said, seem to appeal to the younger generation. But Ed Bark, a TV critic behind the TV review website Uncle Barky's Bytes, said that CBS has captured the younger demographic with multi-camera sitcoms like ""The Big Bang Theory"" and is doing well with its Monday night lineup. ""CBS is clearly wedded to that format, obviously because they have had success with it,"" Bark said. ""It is in some ways puzzling that networks don't look at it and say that this is what people are still used to. You would think that maybe more networks would follow CBS' example."" That could be why NBC is now experimenting with a new multi-camera sitcom lineup. Recently, NBC revealed its mid-season 2012 schedule, which included ""Whitney"" and ""Are You There, Chelsea?"" being given a Wednesday slot, similar to the network's single-camera-dominated Thursday lineup that includes ""30 Rock."" Even though many critics like Bark favor single-camera sitcoms as the more refined format, he said that it doesn't mean multi-camera sitcoms are not acclaim-worthy. ""It persists in the mind of networks that the cooler audience would prefer single-camera sitcoms,"" he said. ""But I don't think anyone would say that 'Seinfeld' and 'Frasier' are simple-minded or over the top because they had a laugh track."" Some critics are also questioning the relevance of the studio audience in comedy, which is a key element in most multi-camera sitcoms. Todd VanDerWerff, The A.V. Club TV editor, addressed this in an article about studio audiences. ""In comedy especially, the need to suggest that a community is watching the show has become less and less important,"" he wrote. ""In some respects, this is an outgrowth of our growing sophistication as an audience."" When VanDerWerff talked to CNN about the article, he also said that the present generation that grew up on ""Friends"" and ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" grew weary of the copycat versions that networks churned out. ""There were so many bad multi-camera sitcoms, where there would be a punchline that was not really funny, but then suddenly the studio audience would erupt in laughter,"" he said. VanDerWerff also argues in his article that the multi-camera sitcom's success depends on how much attention the producers pay to the audience. While attending a recent taping for ""2 Broke Girls,"" he noticed that the writers changed lines and the cast members altered their delivery based on the audience's reactions. ""This was unlike anything else: Theater with do-overs,"" VanDerWerff wrote. ""Seeing the episode filmed suggested there's still life in the format."" VanDerWerff said that while he likes ""2 Broke Girls,"" there's still a lot of work that needs to be done. He said that sitcom producers and writers should take up the challenge and figure out how to make multi-camera sitcoms more relevant today. If it's done right, he would not be surprised if multi-cameras sitcoms rule the comedy scene next year. ""I want there to be a good multi-camera sitcom,"" VanDerWerff said. ""It's going to take writers who are now working single-camera comedies to come back. It's going to take someone to shake it up.""","Multi-camera sitcoms like ""Two and a Half Men"" seem to be dominating ratings this fall .

"(CNN) -- Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin, known to many people more as an aggrieved movie character or perceived tax dodger than as an actual person, has finally spoken out. In an interview with a magazine in his family's native Brazil, Saverin -- a newly minted billionaire after Facebook's public stock offering -- talked about his taxes, his relationship with co-founder Mark Zuckerberg and life after ""The Social Network."" Many observers believe Saverin, who, according to the Facebook origin story was slighted by Zuckerberg as the site grew, was a primary source for the book ""The Accidental Billionaires,"" on which ""Social Network"" is based. Surprise: The Internet hates rich people . But the end result was ""fantasy,"" he said. And, no, he never angrily threw a laptop at Zuckerberg as his Hollywood counterpart, Andrew Garfield, did in the film. It's a statement Fabio Altman, of magazine Veja, writes is instantly believable given Saverin's reserved nature. ""That's Hollywood, not a documentary,"" the 30-year-old Saverin says in the interview conducted in his multimillion-dollar residence in Singapore. Saverin filed a lawsuit against Facebook over his reduced stake in the company, and the legal dispute was settled out of court. But despite well-documented friction over the years, Saverin says he bears no ill will toward Zuckerberg. ""I can only speak well of Mark; I don't resent him,"" Saverin said. ""His focus from Day One until today is admirable. He was a visionary and always knew Facebook would only grow if it remained true to its central idea of people presenting themselves truthfully and without pseudonyms. ""That is the great power of Facebook that allowed it to transform into an instrument of protest, as in Egypt, but also as an instrument of business and, beyond that, a natural way to have contact with friends."" Saverin has had little to do with Facebook in recent years. But he re-entered the public consciousness recently when, days before Facebook stock was due to hit Wall Street, he renounced his U.S. citizenship in favor of Singapore, where he has lived since 2009. Many saw it as a dodge -- a way to avoid paying U.S. taxes on his share of the company, valued somewhere around $2 billion. He says that's not the case and noted that, as has been reported, he's paying his taxes. ""The decision was strictly based on my interest of living and working in Singapore,"" he said. ""I am obligated and I will pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes to the American government. I already paid and I will keep paying whatever taxes I owe based on my time as a U.S. citizen."" Saverin's father, Roberto, echoed those thoughts in the article. ""It was hard for me, because of the life I built in the U.S., hearing from Eduardo that he had to give up on his citizenship,"" he said. ""But he did this not because he wanted to, but because he had no other choice as a foreigner living in Singapore, where financial transactions are more restricted and bureaucratic for those who hold a U.S. passport. There was no other way."" Roberto and his family emigrated to the United States from Brazil amid political turmoil, and Saverin's registered place of birth is Miami. Saverin continues to work as an investor and partner in Internet startups from his Singapore apartment, where an office contains three, 27-inch Mac monitors on which he constantly monitors everything from stock prices to the weather, Altman writes. As for Facebook itself? Saverin still has his own profile, with more than 1 million people subscribed to it. But he uses it almost exclusively for news about his new startups, keeping the personal details to himself. ""I don't like showing my private life online,"" he said.","Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin opens up to Brazilian magazine .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A US Airways plane with 155 people on board ditched into a chilly Hudson River on Thursday, apparently after striking at least one bird upon takeoff from New York's LaGuardia Airport, according to officials and passengers. iReporter Julie Pukelis used a camera and a telescope to get this view of the scene in the river. Everyone on board was accounted for and alive, officials said. About 15 people were being treated at hospitals and others were being evaluated at triage centers. Flight 1549, headed to Charlotte, North Carolina, was airborne less than three minutes, according to FAA spokeswoman Laura Brown. The pilot radioed to air traffic controllers that he had experienced a bird strike and declared an emergency, a New Jersey State Police source said. ""I think a lot of people started praying and just collecting themselves,"" said passenger Fred Berretta. ""It was quite stunning.""  Watch passenger describe landing » . He said he was expecting the plane to flip over and break apart, but it did not. ""It was a great landing,"" Berretta said. Air traffic controllers at LaGuardia saw the plane clear the George Washington Bridge by less than 900 feet before gliding into the water about 3:31 p.m., an aviation source told CNN. iReport.com: Are you there? Send images . Witness Ben Vonklemperer said he watched the plane from the 25th floor of an office building. ""If someone's going to land a plane in the water, this seemed the best possible way to do it,"" Vonklemperer said. ""The way they hit it was very gradual. A very slow contact with the water."" As the situation began to settle Thursday evening, the flight's pilot, Chesley B. ""Sully"" Sullenberger, emerged as a hero, with praise being heaped on him by passengers, officials and aviation experts. ""I don't think there's enough praise to go around for someone who does something like this. This is something you really can't prepare for,"" said former Delta pilot Denny Walsh. ""You really don't practice water landings in commercial airplanes. Just the sheer expertise he demonstrated is amazing."" US Airways CEO Doug Parker said it would be premature to speculate about the cause of the accident until the National Transportation Safety Board, which is sending a team to the site, completed an investigation. A source familiar with the situation, however, told CNN the pilot reported a double bird strike, but it was unclear whether that meant birds in both engines or two birds in one engine. The pilot initially said he needed to go back, and air traffic controllers started to give him clearance to do so, but the pilot said he wanted to head to Teterboro, New Jersey, because it was closer. That was the last transmission from the pilot, the source said. Passenger Alberto Panero said that within a few minutes after takeoff, he heard a loud bang and smelled smoke.  Watch passenger say he heard a loud bang » . ""That's when we knew we were going down and into the water. We just hit, and somehow the plane stayed afloat and we were able to get on the raft. It's just incredible right now that everybody's still alive."" Passenger Jeff Kolodjay of Norwalk, Connecticut, said he was sitting in seat 22A, near one of the engines. ""The captain came on and said, 'Look, we're going down. Brace for impact.' Everyone looked at each other and we said our prayers. I said about five Hail Marys,"" said Kolodjay, who was headed to Charlotte to play golf. ""The plane started filling with water pretty quick,"" he said. ""It was scary. There was a lady with her baby on my left-hand shoulder, and she was crawling over the seats.""  Watch footage of plane in water » . Police, fire and Coast Guard boats, along with commercial ferries, were quickly on the scene as passengers lined up on slightly submerged safety chutes. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said later Thursday that the plane was tied to a pier at Battery Park City in lower Manhattan. As night fell, Coast Guard and FDNY boats remained at the scene. President Bush commended those involved in the rescue. ""Laura and I are inspired by the skill and heroism of the flight crew as well as the dedication and selflessness of the emergency responders and volunteers who rescued passengers from the icy waters of the Hudson,"" he said. Bloomberg also commended the pilot for not leaving the plane until he had checked to make sure everyone had been been evacuated. ""It would appear that the pilot did a masterful job of landing the plane in the river and then making sure that everybody got out,"" Bloomberg said. ""I had a long conversation with the pilot,"" Bloomberg said. ""He walked the plane twice after everybody else was off, and tried to verify that there was nobody else on board, and assures us there were not."" ""There is a heroic pilot,"" said Gov. David Paterson. ""We have had a miracle on 34th Street, I believe we now have a miracle on the Hudson."" The temperature in New York was 20 degrees about the time of the crash off Manhattan's west side.  See map of crash site » . Dr. Gabriel Wilson, associated medical director of the emergency room at Roosevelt Hospital, said 55 survivors were checked out and cleared to leave from the scene. Those being treated at hospitals included a husband and wife with hypothermia at Roosevelt Hospital, as well as a flight attendant with a leg fracture, hospital spokeswoman Michelle Stiles said. Since 1975, five large jetliners have had major accidents in which bird strikes played a role, according to the Web site of Bird Strike Committee USA, a volunteer group dedicated to reducing the frequency and severity of the strikes. More than 56,000 bird strikes were reported to the FAA from 1998 to 2004, according to the group's Web site. People who believe they may have had relatives on the flight may call US Airways at 1-800-679-8215 within the United States, the airline said.

"(CNN) -- The killer's parents won't talk about him. That at least is what their friend told CNN on Thursday. Their thoughts are on the other six victims of Friday's killing spree in Santa Barbara, the friend said. Elliot Rodger, who fatally stabbed three people and shot three others, himself was found dead with a gunshot wound to his head after crashing his black BMW. ""We are crying in pain for the victims and their families. It breaks our hearts on a level we didn't think possible,"" Rodger's family said in a statement read by a family friend on ""New Day."" ""The feeling of knowing that it was our son's actions that caused the tragedy can only be described as hell on Earth."" In a 137-page document, not to mention videos and musings on social media, 22-year-old Rodger hinted that years of rejection and jealousy led him to lash out against beautiful women and popular men. Simon Astaire, the family friend, shed some light on the kind of person that Rodger was. ""As soon as you met him, he was unbearably reserved, self-contained; he seemed to merge into the walls,"" he said. In one brief conversation, Rodger asked Astaire, a novelist, whether writing was a lonely experience. Astaire described the process as ""solitary,"" and Rodger replied with ""I know what you mean"" and turned away. ""He seemed the loneliest person in the world,"" Astaire said. As the tragedy unfolded near the University of California, Santa Barbara campus, Rodger's parents were putting the clues together that it might be their son who was involved. His mother received Rodger's manifesto, and after reading just four lines, she immediately went to YouTube to look at the videos her son had posted, Astaire said. She watched the first 20 seconds of a video titled ""Retribution"" and then called her ex-husband. Both got on the road toward Santa Barbara as the shooting was unfolding. The mother's fears were realized when she heard on the radio that a black BMW, like Rodger's, was involved. ""It was the longest journey of their lives and, I would suggest, everyone's nightmare,"" Astaire said. Among the victims were Rodger's two roommates and a visitor, Cheng Yuan Hong, 20; George Chen, 19; and Weihan ""David"" Wang, 20. Each was stabbed to death. But Rodger didn't stop there. He embarked on a shooting rampage Friday night, killing two young women: Katherine Cooper, 22, and Veronika Weiss, 19, both members of the Delta Delta Delta sorority. He then went into a deli and killed UCSB junior Christopher Martinez, 20, who was getting a sandwich. Martinez's father, Richard Martinez, has publicly called for stricter gun control laws. One of the parents of a child killed in the Sandy Hook school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, wrote an open letter to Richard Martinez. The tragedy of losing a child to gun violence has made them part of the same extended family, Mark Barden wrote. ""My heart breaks for you because I know just a little about the long road ahead of you,"" he wrote, encouraging Richard Martinez to continue being an advocate for gun safety regulations. ""You will find your own path down this difficult road,"" Barden wrote. ""But know that we are here for you and all of you who have been touched by this tragedy. Together we can and will build a safer world for all our children."" The firearms shop Shooters Paradise of Oxnard sold Rodger a gun just before the killings, manager Kevin White said. Rodger had an Isla Vista address and wasn't acting strangely when he bought the gun, White said. White, an alum of UCSB, said he spoke briefly with Rodger about Isla Vista. There was a 10-day waiting period -- no red flags arose in the background check -- and then Rodger picked up the gun, White said. The manager pointed out that a gun wasn't the only weapon used in the killings. ""It happens from time to time, but what about the guy who sold him the knives or the swords that he used, or what about the guy who sold him the car that he was driving around and hit people?"" White said. ""Do they feel bad, or did they know he was going to do something bad with it? I mean, we sell tools. They're items. It's no different than the guy that sold him the knife that he used,"" White said. California lawmakers push 'gun violence restraining order' after mass shooting .

"(CNN) -- As Elizabeth Sullivan stood on the field at Comfort Zone Camp, staring out at the ""normal"" kids playing ice-breaker games and elbow tag, she realized, ""It's OK to have fun."" Six months earlier, she lost her father when he collapsed while jogging at night. He died in the ambulance on the way to the hospital. The 12-year-old never got to say goodbye. But not all of the one in seven Americans who lose a parent or sibling before the age of 20 learn to cope the way Sullivan has. In fact, 73 percent of adults believe that their lives would have been ""much better"" had their loved ones not died when they were young, according to a survey released Monday by Comfort Zone Camp, a nonprofit provider of childhood bereavement camps, and Matthew Greenwald and Associates Inc. Of the 1,006 adults surveyed, 110 had lost a parent before the age of 20, 52 lost a sibling, and 13 lost both. Participants had to be at least 25 years old to take part in the poll, which was conducted between November and December via the Internet. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.2 percentage points. The majority of participants agreed that they would trade one year of their life for one more day with their departed parent. However, about 59 percent of people who lost a parent at a young age think they have become stronger as a result, saying that losing a loved one gave them a greater appreciation of family relationships. There is not one way to interpret each individual's idea of ""much better,"" said Pete Shrock, national program director at Comfort Zone. But with any loss, life is going to be different; however, that doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be worse. ""The family is a unit, and everyone plays a significant role in how that family communicates and works. ... It's like a link in a chain,"" he said. ""When you move that link -- it doesn't matter if it's directly in the middle, to the left or the right -- there's a disruption in the chain, and it will never be the same."" About 85 percent of parents who lost a spouse said they wish there were more resources for their grieving children. Kate Killion does, too. Killion, 53, who lost her father suddenly when she was 8 years old, said there were very few bereavement services available for children in the 1960s. ""People didn't recognize how children process death and grief,"" she said. ""The adults in my life tried to protect me by not talking about it. They thought I wouldn't think about it as much. That isn't the case. Giving children the chance to express their feelings and help them process [loss] is so important."" Killion started dealing with the loss when she was in her 20s by talking openly about her father -- something she could not do with her mother, who shut down after her father's death. Killion said her brother, who was 12 at the time, never found the support she found. ""He just closed up. He's that way to this day,"" she said. ""That's how much it changes your life. He was a vulnerable, confused little boy, and he still hasn't dealt with it. It stays with you forever unless you can really go there and deal with it."" Not only do siblings tend to deal with the same loss differently, there are many differences in the ways men and women handle grief, Shrock said. While 38 percent of the women surveyed for Comfort Zone's study ""strongly agreed"" that ""losing a parent was the toughest thing [they've] had to deal with,"" only 29 percent of men agreed. Daddy's little girl is going to react differently to the loss of her father than the young man who just lost the person who was supposed to teach him to play catch and drive a stick shift, Shrock added. Milestones such as proms, graduations and weddings are among the top concerns for many children and young adults. But for Sullivan, now 23,  it's more about the little things, like going to a college football game. It's all about learning how to cope, she said, which she finally managed to do while making breakfast eight years after her father's death. She was making pastina, an Italian dish she and her father used to make together. After cracking an egg over the tiny pieces of pasta and butter in her pot, she began to stir quickly so the egg would spread before everything congealed. ""When we used to make it before I went to school, he would cheer me on and tell me to stir faster, 'stir, stir, stir,' "" she said. ""Making that pasta and thinking about him cheering me on and laughing was the most connected I've been able to feel to him. That's when I realized how I need to cope: by doing the things that make me feel connected."" There are always going to be good days and bad days, she said. ""I remember a lot of people telling me initially that I should write in a journal. That wasn't for me at the time. It's important not be afraid to try things and figure out what works for you. Be willing to talk to people .... There's not a right or a wrong way to grieve.""","One in seven Americans lose parent or sibling before age of 20 .

"Cincinnati (CNN) -- Charles Manson casts a long shadow. No one knows that better than his grandson, Jason Freeman, who is speaking out for the first time about growing up under, what he calls, a ""family curse"" started by Manson and his so-called ""Manson family."" ""I'm personally, I'm coming out,"" says the 6-foot-2 kickboxer and cage fighter. Freeman, whose father killed himself in 1993, is ""coming out,"" he says, because he wants the real Manson family to stop hiding from a name that still has the power to evoke fear. Today, Freeman wants to understand his roots and himself a bit better, two things denied him as a child. He knew from a young age that Charles Manson was his grandfather, but it never registered till one day in eighth-grade history class, said Freeman. Our teacher "" ... was talking about Charles Manson and I'm looking around like, are there people staring at me?"" Forbidden from talking about Charles Manson to his school friends lest they tease and taunt him, Freeman always felt different from the other kids. Even behind closed doors and with his own family, talk about Charles Manson was discouraged. He was not permitted to ask his grandmother, Rosalie, about Charles Manson, the man she married in 1955. It was a ghostly elephant roaming through his life. More than anything, Freeman wants to connect with the father he knew only through an occasional letter or gift. He believes his father, who changed his name to Jay White, purposely stayed away from him, not wanting to tarnish his childhood in the same way his had been. ""He just couldn't let it go,"" reckons Freeman. ""He couldn't live it down. He couldn't live down who his father was."" Death on a desolate highway . Jay White, who was cursed with the name Charles Manson Jr., killed himself on June 29, 1993, on a desolate section of highway in Burlington, Colorado, just west of the Kansas state line. The death certificate offers few clues as to why there and what finally pushed him over the edge. The document indicates it was about 10:15 a.m. when he died from a ""self inflicted gunshot wound to the head"" at ""exit 438 on interstate 70."" Freeman, who wrestles, fights and suffers the pain of tattoos in his off-time, makes a living working on oil rigs in western Pennsylvania. He is a classically tough guy. But when it comes to the father he never met and when he thinks of what he went through as a child, he tears up. When asked what he'd like his father to know, Freeman gets emotional and, fighting back tears, he whispers, ""I want him to know ... he missed out on a lot."" Specifically, he wishes his father were there to enjoy his grandchildren and see the life he has built for himself. ""I see my kids, you know, and that's kinda where I get shook up,"" he says the tears rolling. ""I would hate to see them grow up without a father. That's important. Very important."" Freeman wishes he could reverse time and tell his father on the stretch of Interstate 70 back in June of 1993 that whatever he was feeling at the moment would pass and a better life lay ahead. Another Manson offspring, another search . The desire to know one's father and to understand oneself is the same force, the same primal instinct, driving Matthew Roberts, a 44-year-old Los Angeles musician. Roberts, who was adopted as an infant, sought out his birth parents in 1998. Through an adoption agency, he found his birth mother; according to Roberts, she was a reclusive and psychologically troubled woman named Terri living in Wisconsin. As they got to know each other, Terri eventually dropped a small bomb on Roberts that set him on a 14-year search for his father. Terri told him that Charles Manson was his father and that she had met Manson in San Francisco in 1967 at an orgy. He was one of four men there, and she was certain Manson had impregnated her. Roberts didn't believe her except that he looked shockingly similar to Manson. He then wrote to Manson in prison, explaining the situation. To Robert's surprise, prisoner B33920 wrote back. Manson, in his frantic style and chicken scratch penmanship, confirmed to Roberts that he was at the 1967 orgy and remembered his mother, Roberts said. He related stories that his mother had told him that only she, or his father, would know. What seemed like fantasy was fast becoming reality. Roberts twice tried to get a DNA match with genetic material from Charles Manson, but the samples were contaminated. But says Dr. Michael Baird, chief science officer at DNA Diagnostics Center in Fairfield, Ohio, there is another way to establish the family link. If Matthew Roberts and Jason Freeman are related, they will have an exact copy of Charles Manson's Y chromosome. ""The male line is easier to compare,"" said Baird, ""because the Y chromosome stands out so strong. We can get a very good correlation if the two are related. So curious were both men to once and for all solve the mystery, CNN took the extraordinary step to have both men's DNA taken and the results compared. A match seemed likely. Same members of notorious family? The men seem predisposed to being related. Their lives run along parallel tracks. Both are drawn to fame and fortune. Roberts is lead singer of a band called New Rising Son. Freeman is a fighter who goes by the name Freebird. But both men have also had to settle for doing more conventional jobs to pay the bills. Freeman has his oil rig job; Roberts is a DJ at the Blue Zebra Cabaret in Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley. Both men have self-published their own books. Freeman's ""Knocking out the Devil"" and Roberts' ""The First Rays of the New Rising Sun."" But the question remained: Is Charles Manson the common denominator in the lives of these two men? It took DNA Diagnostic Center 48 hours to resolve a mystery that Roberts chased for 14 years. With both men in the same room, Baird told the men what they found. ""We did a battery of DNA tests. We studied your DNA along several points, and we have concluded you do not share a common biological ancestry."" The news dropped on the room like a fact etched in lead. Jason Freeman exclaimed ""holy cow."" Freeman hoped to gain an uncle and perhaps a bit more insight into his family and his father's life. Matthew Roberts was visibly shaken as though he had just been robbed. Roberts was upset. ""Now there's no chance of knowing who my father is,"" said Roberts. ""That's the only lead I had, so now I have no chance of meeting or knowing my biological father."" Most people would be overjoyed to discover that Charles Manson wasn't related to them, but Roberts now feels his 14-year search for a father has ended in a cul de sac, without definition and not sure where to go next. Such is the power of wanting to know where we come from and trying to make sense of our present lives by knowing our past. For both men, the search continues.

"(CNN) -- Who is Stanislas Cordova? That's the burning question at the heart of ""Night Film,"" the anticipated follow-up to best-selling author Marisha Pessl's 2006 literary debut. Pessl burst onto the scene in 2006 with ""Special Topics in Calamity Physics."" She received a six-figure advance, almost unheard of for a first-time author, a ton of hype and even some snarky backlash over her photogenic looks. But the book lived up to expectations, selling some 200,000 copies and landing on The New York Times' list of Best Books of 2006. Seven years later, ""Night Film"" is hitting bookstores this week amid greater expectations and even more hype. Movie rights are already spoken for by Chernin Entertainment, the studio behind ""Oblivion"" and ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,"" and critics are raving about Pessl's multimedia storytelling approach, which takes readers beyond the novel's pages to explore the story of a mysterious director and the washed-up reporter out to expose him. Pessl's fictional mash-up of Stanley Kubrick, Roman Polanski and David Lynch hasn't been seen in public for 30 years. His movies are so frightening no theater will show them; his cult of fans meet in abandoned buildings and underground tunnels for secret screenings. Investigative journalist Scott McGrath tried to expose Cordova years ago and it backfired, costing him his job, marriage and reputation. When Cordova's daughter turns up dead in an apparent suicide, McGrath sees an opportunity to exact revenge against the man he blames for his downfall. Pessl weaves into the narrative excerpts from magazine articles, newspaper headlines, police reports, crime scene photos and screen shots of online message boards. She also wrote and directed several short films being featured over the next few weeks on YouTube that offer clues into the book's mystery, including snippets and trailers from Cordova's films. Pessl said she wanted to give readers another way to interact with the story, hoping her fans obsess over ""Night Film"" just as she did writing it. Fast facts: Marisha Pessl . Age: 35 . Hometown: Grew up in Asheville, North Carolina; lives in New York City. For fans of: Psychological thrillers like Gillian Flynn's critically acclaimed ""Gone Girl,"" and ""The Secret History"" by Donna Tartt. Five questions with Marisha Pessl . CNN: What was the spark behind this book? Pessl: It was definitely Cordova and the idea of this underground, hidden figure. I'd done a lot of research on filmmakers and the idea of an auteur and patriarch who invites people to his estate to make a film, like Kubrick shot his films on a set that had been built on his estate so he didn't have to leave. That was a germinating idea for me in terms of Cordova. Also, the idea of someone hidden, our world is so overexposed right now. People don't get out of bed without tweeting about it. People don't make art these days without begging people to interact with it, to buy it, to consume it in some way. I wanted to create the antithesis of all that, a figure who went out of his way to become completely underground, who didn't care about selling any kind of product. It was really about a return to mystery in our lives and finding that again in our overexposed world. CNN: The book has a compulsive, driven feel to it. Was it that way for you writing it? Pessl: The writing process was exactly as obsessive. In some ways the writer's experience with the material can't help but drip down onto the pages. I wouldn't call it anxiety because I really did love creating this world, but there were things that kept me awake at night. I think that sense of dislocation and claustrophobia and not exactly knowing where I was going, only that I was driven to find out what was there at the very end. I had all those same experiences as a writer that my characters did, simply because of the nature of this book. I wanted to push myself to the end of my writing experience and then see if I could take myself even further. I really wanted to challenge myself. CNN: Tell me why you used a multimedia approach to the story? Pessl: I wasn't trying to break any boundaries but I wanted to find the best means by which to tell the story. I personally love archives and I love going through old antique stores and looking at old wedding photographs, and old class photos of people in kindergarten in the 1920s. I love looking at the ephemera people leave behind when they're no longer here. I wanted to bring that feeling to ""Night Film"" and through those bits and pieces bring Cordova's world to life. I wanted to make his world really immediate to the reader. There's a voyeuristic quality that I think is really compelling to be able to peruse old reports. I definitely went through a lot of old police blogs and read through crime scene reports. It's absolutely fascinating the level of detail that goes into describing things like the blood spatter pattern and the positioning of the body, it's absolutely fascinating. In this CSI world, where everyone knows a lot about forensics, it made sense to give that to readers, rather than just telling them about it. CNN: Did the book turn out the way you'd envisioned? Pessl: I think it became even darker and more gnarled. I wanted a really dark, mythical odyssey, something really immersive. I began writing it around the time of the financial crisis in late 2008, when it felt like the world was in such a state of chaos. Every time you turned on the TV there was more bad news and it seemed as if things were really dire. In New York City people were really down and I know I wanted an escape. I wanted something that was thrilling, and enigmatic, that moved, but also multi-layered with great characters. I thought more in terms of a mood and a feeling and an experience. That was the story I wanted to read and I think as writers we always write what we wish existed. So I wanted something dark but I think it's critical even in those dark places to have lightness. Even when things were dire, as they were in 2008, there's always time for humor, which is why my character Scott has so many asides in the book. CNN: While your book is dark, there's also a feeling of hope? Pessl: The book does have some dark places but our world is dark, and experiences that people go through are horrifying. Though evil exists, my world view is there's always hope. With the human spirit there's always the possibility of transcendence and something good. In the end, I don't think we live in a hopeless, amoral world. I think goodness exists and I wanted to convey that while allowing the reader to step to the edge and formulate his or her own conclusions.","""Night Film"" is the latest thriller from best-selling author Marisha Pessl .

"(CNN) -- Though they had perhaps crossed paths several times on campus, it was only when Andy Lalinde was scrolling through images of cute girls online that the one with brunette hair standing in some South American country caught his eye. He opened her profile and saw her name was Michelle Przybyski. She was 26 and studying to be a nurse. Better yet, she lived only a few blocks away. With nothing to lose, Lalinde wrote a funny message proclaiming his love for nurses and hit send. One walk of four hours with Lalinde's dog, Domino, around campus and a date at the library (that didn't really involve studying) later, the two Columbia University graduate students applied for a marriage license in New York just 10 days after meeting in person. Why so soon? ""I think when you know, you know,"" Michelle said. While they could have passed each other walking to class, it took Datemyschool.com -- an online dating website exclusively for college students -- to bring them together and officially exchange vows on April 29. With countless dating websites such as match.com, eharmony.com and okcupid.com, the online dating market is a bit crowded. But Date My School has inched its way in and formed a niche for students searching for a boyfriend or girlfriend who shares the same educational goals and understands school comes first on the priority list. Lara Hirner, a grad student at Columbia University's Teachers College, has gone on dates to the opera, Central Park and ice cream shops with guys she met on Date My School. ""The guys place the same priority on education and the same passion for their careers as I do,"" Hirner said. ""We're also at similar places in our lives, being students, which makes it easier to relate."" Columbia University students Balazs Alexa and Jean Meyer started the dating website on campus in November. This month, the site launched at 140 more schools nationwide, giving more college students the opportunity to meet their future husbands or wives. Alexa and Meyer, both recent graduates of the Business School, came up with the idea after a girlfriend complained that there was not enough testosterone in the School of Social Work. On the flip side, men in the Business School often wished for more women study buddies. If potential lovers weren't meeting in the classroom, the university needed a better platform for both sexes to interact. The solution: A dating website exclusively for college students. With more than 20,000 registered users, the site continues growing and has doubled its members in the past four months. Some have compared it to Facebook -- pointing out that the social network was also open to only college students when it began. But Alexa insists Date My School is not the next Facebook. ""We expanded in a similar manner that they did initially, but then they opened it up for everybody in the world,"" he said. ""We will never do that."" Only students or alumni with an active university e-mail account can register on the site. From there, users can narrow their searches to students attending specific schools. They can go one step further and select to meet only students with majors such as business, art or engineering. Improving your looks online . In its first few months, Date My School was only offered to undergraduate and graduate students at 20 schools, including Columbia, New York University, Harvard University and MIT. The site took off at a rapid pace, as 1,300 students at Columbia signed up in the first week. ""I think we are responsible for more than half of the dates and meetings between students on campus,"" Alexa said. He added that the site is successful because it's safe, and it works. ""Usually, people have a date within the same day they register,"" Alexa said. ""If you go to any other dating site, you have to have conversations with other people for weeks before you can be sure it's safe, that (the person) is not a freak."" With Date My School, there's an initial trust that stems from choosing dates who share common interests and live on campus or attend a nearby school. That's the beauty of Date My School, says Julie Spira, an online dating expert and author of ""The Perils of Cyber Dating."" ""A student at GW might want to meet someone to date at American University,"" she said. ""Now, it's both technically and geographically possible for them to find love online."" College: hookups in, dating out . The site fills a void for college students in the online dating world. According to Spira, about 25% of match.com users are 30 years or younger, and there's no guarantee they're college grads. Date My School is the only dating site that specifies the user's alma mater. ""If somebody really has their heart on meeting somebody from Princeton, this is a great way to narrow down the search,"" Spira said. While Date My School's creators want to distance themselves from Facebook, Spira credits it for lifting the stigma surrounding online dating. Spira, who tried online dating in 1994 before match.com and eharmony.com existed, explained that people now feel comfortable talking to others and forming relationships online. ""If it wasn't for Facebook's popularity ... it wouldn't have allowed online dating to really become what I feel is now social dating,"" she said. The Pew Internet & American Life Project surveyed the number of online daters in 2006. Results indicated that one in 10 Internet users have tried online dating sites. Online dating tips . The number is much higher today, according to Alexa, but people still avoid online dating because they're embarrassed or believe dating sites are a waste of time. ""They think that if they go to a bar, it is still more easy to get a date,"" he said. But for students who are swamped with hours of studying and lab research, meeting someone at a bar or party is just not that simple when there's no time to socialize. Karent Zorogastua, a second-year grad student at Columbia's School of Public Health with a hectic schedule, registered with match.com but stopped after guys she was not interested in contacted her. ""There was one guy who looked like Flavor Flav, and I was like, 'Oh no, this is not working for me,' "" she said. ""Nothing against Flavor Flav, but he's not my type."" Zorogastua said she'd be more willing to give Date My School a go, since she could narrow the search to a student also in an intense grad program who understands she doesn't have to time to commit to a serious relationship. Don't be offended by online-dating rejection . ""A lot of people knock it, they just thinks it's kind of cheesy, but you know what, it's an option,"" Andy Lalinde said. Before registering on Date My School, the 33-year-old wanted to be in a relationship but was just too busy to go out. ""It was always just me, the dog and school,"" Lalinde admitted. He says he has Date My School to thank for meeting his wife and now helps his friends write profiles because his humorous tone is what attracted Michelle. Alexa and Meyer, 29-year-old best friends who have made running Date My School a full-time job, plan to continue expanding the site across the United States and eventually France, where Meyer is from. A recent $500,000 grant from investors and future business prospects are helping them turn their match-making service into a profitable venture. And with the thousands of datable women at their fingertips, you'd expect the guys to be at the movies every night. But Alexa said they have a strict policy that forbids dating anyone on their site. ""Of course, girls are writing to us all the time, but we try to resist,"" he said.","Two Columbia graduates started an online dating site exclusively for college students .

"(CNN) -- Post-traumatic stress disorder begins as a natural response to danger, according to psychiatrists. Rachel Hope says her life had been the stuff of nightmares. She reached out to South Carolina psychiatrist Dr. Michael Mithoefer in 2005 after suffering the effects of PTSD for years and trying various treatments, to no avail. ""My mom was 19 when she had me, and she was very ill-equipped,"" Hope said. But the worst arrived when Hope was 4 years old and her mother went on vacation, leaving her with a male friend who'd agreed to babysit. As it turned out, says Hope, he was a pedophile who raped her repeatedly over the six-week stretch that her mother was gone. When they finally reunited, her mother noticed a change. ""She told me, 'I just wondered why you were kind of withdrawn and weren't the happy child you used to be,' "" Hope said. But the angry, bewildered child didn't tell tell her mother what had happened, and no one put the pieces together. Not long after, Hope went to live with her grandmother in San Diego, where she did well in school and became accustomed to a ""normal"" life. Read the first installment of this three-part series . But five years later, another catastrophe struck -- literally. She was hit by a delivery truck as she was riding her bike to a dance lesson. Hope nearly died. As it was, she needed two reconstructive surgeries on her face and was partially paralyzed for four months. Yet, she survived. The 11-year-old found strength in stoicism. '""That was good and bad. I mean, it was heartbreaking to be a kid like that,"" she said. ""To realize, there's not gonna be a magical fairy that shows up. 'Bad news, kid, no one's saving you.' And that was a big turning point."" Seemingly against all odds, she pulled her body and mind back together. She became fascinated by notions of human potential, the way the mind works. And she asked herself the big questions. ""I wanted to make sense of it all."" It took years, however, to reach out to Mithoefer. Her plan: to see whether she could free herself from torment by taking a drug called MDMA, commonly known as Ecstasy. Party drug and forbidden substance . The compound known as 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, or MDMA, was first synthesized in Germany in 1912. No one quite knew what to do with it. It was studied by the military in the 1950s and eventually emerged from the lab in the late 1970s. The first report on its effect in humans was published in 1978 by independent chemist Alexander Shulgin and David Nichols, a professor of pharmacology at Purdue University. At the same time, Shulgin was churning out the drug in his lab and sharing it with a handful of psychiatrists and therapists who saw MDMA as a lever for human growth. Dr. George Greer helped Shulgin make an early batch and offered it to interested couples and individuals. ""MDMA reduced the fear response, so people could talk about the things that made them afraid or upset,"" he recalled. At the same time, ""people were able to have normal cognitive function, and the insights they had were able to translate to everyday life."" A few people had mild panic attacks, says Greer, ""but in general, it was well-tolerated."" He described his experiments in a paper, detailing the experiences of 29 people. Not everyone was so careful. By the mid-'80s, Ecstasy was also in use as a party drug. In the spring of 1985, the alarm was sounding, and Ecstasy was making headlines. Congress held hearings, and the Drug Enforcement Administration put MDMA on the list of forbidden substances alongside heroin and LSD. The uproar left the small community of MDMA therapists shaken. Greer submitted testimony asserting the drug's safety to the DEA, but to little avail. Rick Doblin, a soon-to-be Harvard graduate student who would later found the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies -- a group wanting to turn mind-altering drugs like Ecstasy into prescription medicine -- saw the writing on the wall. Shortly before MDMA was banned, he persuaded Nichols to synthesize two kilograms for researchers, for the cost of materials. ""Doing science that gets reported, that's an idea we can sort of leverage,"" Doblin said. To win broader acceptance for MDMA -- and for cousins like LSD and psilocybin, the mind-altering compound in so-called magic mushrooms -- ""the medical route was the only route. Everything else was blocked."" That meant a formal plan for drug development: study protocols, institutional review boards and the rest. Mithoefer, a University of Virginia-trained clinician who specializes in trauma and had a long-running interest in MDMA, was the perfect partner. Before taking Hope's call, Mithoefer had spent nearly three years navigating the federal bureaucracy to win approval for his small experiment, designed to test a simple question: Is MDMA, used in a clinical setting, safe? 'I got to survive. But for what?' As a teenager, Hope marched with a precocious sense of purpose. At age 13, she moved across the country to live with family friends in New Jersey. A year later, she was back in California, where she found a full-time secretarial job while completing her high school coursework. She built a strong relationship with her father, who had separated from her mother when she was an infant. By the time she was 17, she was back with her mom but supporting herself financially. She was wary of relationships but wanted a family, and at 19 she found a like-minded colleague who agreed to co-parent a son. They moved to Hawaii, because she had fond memories of a childhood vacation. ""I think there was a part of me that thought I could run away from all that crazy horrible stuff,"" she said. ""I was trying to find ways to be okay."" But the peace was fragile. When her father died in 1991, Hope became so depressed, she fell into a stupor. She was hospitalized, and for the first time, a psychiatrist listened as she talked about her childhood abuse. It was eye-opening, but therapy offered limited relief. She grew well enough to leave the hospital but found little joy outside. In 1998, she suffered another breakdown after learning from a friend that the man who'd sexually abused her was under investigation for molesting another girl. Under the weight of stress and emotion, Hope's carefully constructed shell began to crack. ""I started having these outrageous flashbacks, and body memories,"" she recalled. ""The first time, I thought someone slipped me a drug. Because it would be these unstoppable, full-body blackout memories, and people would tell me later, 'You were just screaming for an hour.' "" She stopped sleeping. Her stomach problems worsened; she vomited every time she ate. Once again, she checked herself into the hospital. Once again, it was all the doctors could do just to tape the pieces back together. ""I became like a survival machine. And I'm kind of blessed, because I didn't become violent or hostile or self-destructive,"" she said. At the same time, a ""normal"" life felt out of reach. ""It was kind of like, 'OK, I got to survive. But for what?' "" To be continued in Monday's story .","Rachel Hope says her childhood was the stuff of nightmares .

"(CNN) -- The Republicans appear to think North Carolina has the answer to their latest conundrum: how to sidestep growing calls for extending unemployment benefits for the 1.3 million Americans who depend on them without looking like uncompassionate conservatives. A measure to renew Emergency Unemployment Compensation died in this Senate last week and it's unclear, given that Congress must now focus on a spending bill, when senators will revisit the bill. Last year, North Carolina's jobless rate fell to a five-year low after Gov. Pat McCrory and the Republican-controlled legislature slashed unemployment benefits. The reason for this, wrote Diana Furchtgott-Roth, a former economist for the George W. Bush administration, is that unemployment is ""intricately linked to the length of unemployment benefits."" ""If the unemployed have a source of income,"" she wrote in Politico, ""they are more likely to turn down lower-paying jobs -- even though they are losing job skills by remaining out of the labor force. The longer the unemployed are out of work, the more their skills atrophy. It is a vicious cycle leading to more long-term unemployment, a characteristic of this recession."" This formulation achieves two things. One, it provides an economic rationale for resisting benefit extension: Jobless insurance discourages people from taking available work. Two, it provides a moral rationale: Discontinuing jobless insurance is the right thing to do. As U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, noted in the Lexington Herald-Leader: ""You could argue that conservatives who argue for shorter unemployment benefits actually have more concern for the worker than liberals who believe in no limits. Conservatives want to get every able-bodied person back into the work force."" While there's little doubt that Paul wants ""every able-bodied person back in the work force,"" there is ample reason to believe he and others have it upside down and backward. Jobless insurance isn't a cause of unemployment. That's caused by an economy that, on its own, would take more than seven years, by one estimate, to return to pre-2008 levels. What's more, Paul's clumsy attempt to retake the moral high ground reflects another puzzle that no Republican or Democrat has thus far faced: How can we continue to promote the values of freedom, hard work and self-reliance when even a full-time job isn't enough to get by? There's one aspect that Furchtgott-Roth omits, and it's a whopper. Indeed, as she noted, some overqualified people surely settled for low-wage, no-benefit jobs after Raleigh cut their jobless insurance. But the more important reason why North Carolina's unemployment rate went down is plain to see: People stopped looking for work. More precisely, they stopped being counted. According to the Department of Labor's most recent jobs report, the U.S. economy added far fewer jobs than expected (74,000 compared to 200,000) but the unemployment rate fell. Why? Because of something called the ""participation rate."" That's the Labor Department's best guess measure of the number of those who are currently working and those who are looking for work. December saw the lowest participation rate in four decades. A low employment rate may be good for politics (making the rounds is an impressive graph depicting a thin blue line dramatically falling over the course of President Barack Obama's time in office). But a low participation rate is bad for the economy and for everyone. It suggests an array of social ills, like millions of educated young people who can't get their lives started. But it also comes at a time when in Washington the need for balanced budgets trumps the need for jobs, and when all the tools used to counteract the panic of 2008 -- including ""the stimulus,"" food stamps, unemployment benefits and the Federal Reserve's monthly infusion of $80 billion -- have expired or are expiring. This year may reveal just how bad the real economy is. The Republicans no doubt fear that if they agree to an extension of unemployment benefits, or compromise on any safety net program, that they won't get the credit. The Democrats will. And unlike the Democrats, who would be rewarded in this year's midterm elections, the Republicans would be punished by voters who believe welfare is, as one congressman put it, ""legalized plunder."" Such is the price for politicizing formerly nonpartisan economic issues. But the Republicans face a philosophical conundrum as well as a political one. As Senator Paul noted: ""The Republican Party has always proposed ideas of less government and more freedom."" But if the economy on its own is incapable of creating the 7.4 million jobs needed to return to ""normal,"" what does such a formulation mean? In terms of the long-term unemployed, it means less government equals less freedom, a lot less. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Stoehr.","John Stoehr: GOP uses North Carolina's lowered jobless rate in unemployment debate .

"(CNN) -- A California death row inmate has provided maps that led to the remains of two bodies and an abandoned rural well that has yielded 1,000 pieces and fragments of bone, authorities said. Wesley Shermantine, one of two so-called ""Speed Freak Killers,"" was sentenced in 2001 for four homicides, Deputy Les Garcia, public information officer for the San Joaquin Sheriff's Office, said Tuesday. Authorities now are looking into whether there could be more buried victims. They set up a hotline for relatives of missing persons who may have fallen victim to Shermantine and another man, between the mid-1980s and 2000, Garcia told CNN. They had received about 50 calls by late Tuesday. Shermantine provided maps and letters to a reporter at the Stockton Record, who then forwarded them to investigators, Garcia said. Searchers, aided by dogs, first went to sites in San Andreas in Calaveras County, he said. One of the pieces of property belonged to the Shermantine family. Human remains were discovered. The remains of Chevelle Wheeler, who disappeared in the 1980s, were tentatively identified, Garcia said. Authorities believe the other victim was Cyndi Vanderheiden. The search for additional victims now is primarily focused on a 19th-century well near Linden, about 30 miles from where the two women's remains were found, Garcia said. Linden is 55 miles south of Sacramento. ""It is very tedious work,"" he said. Since Thursday, searchers have dug down about 45 feet and have not reached water. They have no idea how many victims may be in the well. ""We are committed to collect all the remains that are humanly possible so that we can bring the loved ones to their families,"" Garcia said. Besides hundreds of pieces of suspected human bone, investigators are unearthing purses, belts, coats, shoes and rings. ""The personal items and the clothing we are finding have been buried for over 20 years,"" he said. Bounty Hunter Leonard Padilla told CNN on Monday that he promised Shermantine $33,000 for information leading to the remains of Wheeler and Vanderheiden. About $18,000 was for the inmate's restitution and $15,000 was for headstones for Shermantine's parents' graves, he said.","Authorities say Calfornia serial killer gave information on body locations .

"New York (CNN) -- Rather than celebrating Father's Day on Sunday afternoon, Horace Russell marched with several thousand people to take a stand against the New York Police Department's controversial ""stop and frisk"" policy. ""I feel it every single day, practically,"" said Russell, who works as a teacher in the Bronx. ""I've been pulled over and pushed against fences, frisked, but have never been arrested."" Russell's story sounded familiar to many of Sunday's marchers, who want to see action from Mayor Michael Bloomberg, and Police Commissioner Ray Kelly -- either by abolishing or reforming stop-and-frisk. Last year, nearly 685,000 people were stopped by officers in cases that ended with no meaningful charge, according to police department statistics. Of these, 87% were African-American or Latino, the police department says. ""They profile me because I'm a Rastafarian and I have dreadlocks, so therefore I get pulled over just for my looks,"" said Russell. Sunday's silent march started at 110th Street and headed down Fifth Avenue, ending at 78th Street after passing Bloomberg's townhouse on 79th Street. ""I don't know a single black or Latino male who doesn't say he is basically afraid to be out on the streets,"" said the Rev. Stephen Phelps, a senior minister at the Riverside Church near West Harlem. He was one of a diverse group of faith leaders, and representatives of some 300 organizations , brought together by the Rev. Al Sharpton's National Action Network. On Sunday morning, speaking at a Christian Cultural Center, Mayor Bloomberg attempted to preempt the demonstration's inevitable message: ""I understand why some people want us to stop making stops,"" he said. ""Innocent people who are stopped can be treated disrespectfully. That is not acceptable... Police Commissioner Kelly and I both believe we can do a better job in this area -- and he's instituted a number of reforms to do that. ""We believe that when it comes to making stops -- to borrow a phrase from President Clinton -- the practice should be mended, not ended."" However, in official circles, there appears to be strong divergence in opinion. ""It's racial profiling of people who are almost all innocent of any wrongdoing,"" said New York City Comptroller John Liu, who was advocating abolition at the protest march. He said he would prefer ""strategies of focused deterrents that we have seen in Atlanta, Chicago and Boston that actually reduce crime."" Jumaane Williams, a New York city councilman from Brooklyn, said Bloomberg and Kelly ""have shown no leadership"" on the stop-and-frisk issue. ""Inherent in any police officer's ability to do their job is their ability to stop somebody they feel is reasonably suspicious. The current policy is not that -- it's stopping people because they are black or brown."" Williams added, ""Whether you say end it or reform it, we have to end the way that policy currently exists.""","Marchers silently protested New York's ""stop and frisk"" policy .
The NYPD says last year nearly 685,000 were stopped in cases that didn't end in charges .
The police department says 87% were African-American or Latino .

"Washington (CNN) -- Senate Republicans again Tuesday blocked Democratic legislation that would require greater transparency into who is behind much of the secretive, often negative campaign advertising filling the airwaves this election season. Supporters of the DISCLOSE Act mustered 53 votes in an effort to advance the bill, but fell short of the 60 needed to break a GOP filibuster. Democrats unanimously supported the bill, while Republicans voted unanimously against it. The legislation, which needs 60 votes to succeed, failed on a 51-44 vote Monday. The legislation would require certain tax-exempt groups involved in political advertising -- which currently are not required to disclose the names of their donors -- to release the names of those who give donations of $10,000 or more. A similar vote Monday ended with the same result. ""During this election, outside spending by GOP shell groups is expected to top $1 billion,"" said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, in a floor speech. ""The names of these front groups contain words like 'freedom' and 'prosperity.' But make no mistake: there is nothing free about an election purchased by a handful of billionaires for their own self-interest."" Read Reid's prepared statement . Democrats say the requirement is a much-needed response to the U.S. Supreme Court's Citizen United decision, which opened the doors to large amounts of campaign spending by corporations, labor unions and other groups. The political advertising all those donations buy ""threatens to drown out the voice of middle-class families in our democracy,"" argued Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-Rhode Island, a chief sponsor of the bill. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, led the GOP charge against the bill and accused Democrats of crafting it to favor labor unions -- traditionally Democratic allies -- over other types of donors. Read McConnell's statement . ""This legislation is an unprecedented requirement for groups to publicly disclose their donors, stripping a protection recognized and solidified by the courts,"" said McConnell, who has advocated for more disclosure in the past so long as it applies to all big players in campaign financing, such as labor unions and trial lawyers. McConnell cited a recent Wall Street Journal analysis that found labor unions spent $4.4 billion on campaigns between 2005 and 2011. Obama picks up campaign cash in the Lone Star State . ""Predictably, unions are exempted from the kind of disclosure Democrats now want to impose on others,"" McConnell said. Democrats disagreed with the Republicans' assertion that labor unions are exempt from their legislation. However, the concern about labor unions appeared to sway key Republicans such as Sen. John McCain of Arizona, a longtime vocal advocate of campaign finance reform, who said he would vote against the bill for that reason. Read McCain's full remarks . ""By conveniently setting high threshold for reporting requirements, the DISCLOSE Act forces some entities to inform the public about the origins of their financial support, while allowing others -- most notably those affiliated with organized labor -- to fly beneath the Federal Election Commission's regulatory radar,"" McCain said.

"London (CNN) -- In May, I experienced what's known as a ""failure to deliver."" Then again last week, it was ""failure to deliver."" The first fail was a maddening experience with FedEx, the next a worse experience with Amazon. These occurred after I relocated to a flat, and discovered the pain of not having a front porch, plant pot or friendly neighbor. How do you apartment dwellers handle this? Thankfully I bullied Fedex into a Saturday morning delivery at no charge, and Amazon reprinted the book I ordered and delivered to my office. But many companies ban personal deliveries -- and this is where what's being called ""click and collect"" comes in. Click and collect allows shoppers to pick up their shopping when and where it suits -- and Britons are leading the way. According to Planet Retail, 35% of Britons who shop online click to buy, then have the goods delivered to a location that suits. Only 5% of Germans and 13% of Americans do the same. When consumers first started online shopping, the collecting wasn't expected to be harder than the clicking. ""Even five years ago, the concept of ordering something online and then having to collect it at a store seemed ludicrous,"" Natalie Berg of Planet Retail told me. ""It takes the whole concept of convenience out of online shopping."" But by 2017, according to Berg, the number of Britons collecting after clicking will soar to 70%. Companies including Argos, CollectPlus, MyHermes and The Post Office are capturing this trend, as are newcomers such as Doddle. In a joint venture with National Rail, Doddle is using the rail stations' extra space as delivery shops, which will be open between 6:00am and 9:00pm seven days a week. This will allow millions of commuters to collect and -- maybe more importantly -- return products bought online. ""Most of the people who travel by rail, to big cities, aren't at home during the day,"" Tim Robinson, CEO of Doddle told me. ""They have that 'sorry you were out' card when they get home. There is a big opportunity to fill that gap."" Ebay will soon allow its online shops to deliver goods through the thousands of Argos outlets. The Post Office also plans to deliver to small independent stores, some of whom have joined the delivery networks CollectPlus or MyHermes. Doddle is touting a twist though. Robinson says 40% of clothing bought online is returned. Many of the 300 Doddle stores planned around rail stations will have changing rooms. ""You don't actually have to take the goods home. You can try it on here and send it straight back."" No more calling in sick, waiting for that new purchase to arrive.","""Click and collect"" is becoming an increasingly popular way to collect good bought online .

"(CNN) -- Justice Sonia Sotomayor may be the most recognizable member of the current Supreme Court, the closest thing to a rock star in robes. The Bronx native has carved a high-watt public identity both on and off the bench. In her five years at the nation's highest court, she has dropped the New Year's Even ball in Times Square, appeared on ""Sesame Street"" and sworn in the vice president at the inauguration. As a new biography vividly illustrates, Sotomayor has found her voice as a justice on a range of hot-button issues: from affirmative action to human rights abuses. ""Breaking In: The Rise of Sonia Sotomayor and the Politics of Justice"" (Farrar, Straus and Giroux) chronicles what it took to put the first Latina on the high court. Author Joan Biskupic offers an incisive, illuminating, behind-the-scenes account of how the 60-year-old justice's upbringing and personality helped propel her to the heights of achievement, while also attracting an inevitable a measure of political criticism and even professional jealousy, which her supporters call unfair. Fresh voices bringing change in Washington can do that, even to someone with Sotomayor's compelling personal story and stellar credentials. High court's same-sex marriage surprise . CNN spoke recently with Biskupic, a legal affairs editor with Reuters who has covered the Supreme Court for a quarter-century. She has previously written biographies of Justices Antonin Scalia and Sandra Day O'Connor. CNN: Why do a book on Sonia Sotomayor? Biskupic: I was curious about the social and political shifts that affected her life and that led to her appointment. It occurred to me that she was born in 1954, which was, of course, the year of Brown [v. Board of Education]. But it was also the year of a case called Hernandez v. Texas, which marked the very first time that the court held that the Constitution protected Hispanics from discrimination, with the same force that it protected blacks. And it seemed that at every point in her youth and early years as an aspiring lawyer, she was in sync with the development of new rights for Latinos. And then she's on the scene in the early '90s when someone like Sen. [Daniel] Moynihan [Democrat from New York] is looking for more diverse candidates to recommend to President George H. W. Bush. And at every point, her trajectory was in sync with the trajectory and rise of Latinos. As I'm working on this book, she suddenly provides this even more interesting story with her own memoir and the kind of figure she becomes off the bench. It became much more exciting. The very last three chapters of my book are devoted to what kind of groundbreaker she's been while she's on the bench and what it's been like to watch her as she's become this huge figure in America, as the people's justice. CNN: She seems to have really found her voice on the bench after five years on this court. Biskupic: She early on was quite a figure for young people of color and not to rally around. They were impressed by her story of coming from the Bronx, coming from the projects, from being someone who really set her mind on achievement after having not much as a kid. So she was always out there with this inspiring story that people were learning from the moment President Obama nominated her in May 2009. What happened on the bench, I think, is that she did find her voice. Last term was really a breakout term when she dissented in the Michigan affirmative action case and spoke not just of why it was important for minorities to be represented in the political process, but what it's like in a day-to-day way to be slighted just because of the color of your skin. One thing I found through my talking to her and talking to others is that she still really does identify herself as being different and being the other. And she's defensive about people who still question her qualifications for being on the bench. She talked about being scrutinized during the confirmation process and people suggesting she wasn't up to the task. She said, ""Why would that be? Is there any reason for them to question me, other than the fact that I was Hispanic?"" And she still feels that, even though she's now been on the bench five years, that people question how she got there and whether she's up to the task, which she's certainly proved that she is. CNN: And yet, you portray her as something of an outsider on the court. Has she earned the respect of her colleagues? Biskupic: She has set herself apart-- she's set up chambers on the third floor [when most chambers are a floor below]. But Sotomayor does have more of a ""separate floor"" mentality. She's out among the people much more vigorously than any of her colleagues. She is more willing to set herself from her more liberal colleagues, in a way that Justice [Elena] Kagan hasn't at all, yet. Just as Sotomayor sees herself as operating as one among nine, Justice Kagan operates trying to build coalition among those nine. Justice Sotomayor has distinguished herself with passionate statements when her fellow justices refuse to take up defendants' appeals. But she also has been willing to separate herself from the other liberals in cases. Justice Sotomayor, in contrast, is more of a solo operator engrossed in her own determinations on a case. And perhaps less interested in getting others to adopt them. I think that she's also been blunt. Her bluntness overall separated her from the others. She talks a lot about how she was different and I think that makes her very approachable and human to the people who come out to greet her when she gives speeches or talks about her book. As much as it makes her very approachable and human beyond the marble walls, it makes her different to the justices because they are a little bit all of the same model. As much as they differ on the law, they have a certain sameness in their personalities. CNN: Her nomination certainly jump-started the conversation about diversity in the courts and the government. Biskupic: You have that scene on the afternoon of May 26, 2009, after he [President Barack Obama] had announced it. He was somewhat ambivalent-- it went down to the wire with Sotomayor and at least two other candidates, and he announces she's his choice, and suddenly, the nation is electrified. He sees it-- suddenly everyone wants to be a ""wise Latina."" He realizes that he's played into this wonderful national moment of diversity and he tells his aide that he's really glad he's done what he's done. And then just a few weeks later, we have [Republican Sen.] Lindsey Graham with a nod toward that sort of enthusiasm, saying, ""Unless you have a complete meltdown, Judge Sotomayor, you're going to be confirmed."" He captured it. This was a nomination that really did capture the attention of people out in America of all ethnicities and races. CNN: Even though she has her own recent autobiography, Justice Sotomayor agreed to talk with you. Biskupic: She was very direct, she wanted to clarify things for me, she wanted to tell me what she was thinking and why she would refer to ""wise Latinas"" and why that was important to her to speak to that audience. She is the one who is always speaking to broader audiences and easily breaks the mold. She said to me: It's very hard for people who haven't lived my life to know what it's like; to have your experience looked down upon, to be viewed as inferior, to be viewed as not smart enough. You need to affirm that you have value. And here's a woman who has made it to the pinnacle of the federal judiciary, who has beat out so many people to get there, but she feels the need to still, as she says, affirm that she has value. I found that interesting. I found her very candid. I do not underestimate her in any way. She's very shrewd, I considered myself very lucky to get audiences with her. But I know that she really did it only to clarify things and elucidate her life and that what mattered most was that she was able to tell her own story in her own book. CNN: What does the future hold for Justice Sotomayor? Biskupic: I would not sell her short on anything. She learned to be effective setting herself apart both as a public figure and on the bench. I believe that she will continue to be more prominent because of what she represents to the nation that believes in this American Dream for people who came up from essentially nothing, as she did in the Bronx. But I think that we'll also see her not just out there as a public figure, but as someone who wants to be an advocate in prisoner cases and also in racially charged cases. We'll see more of that as she becomes more comfortable, not just off the bench, but in the black robes right there on the bench.","Author speaks on ""Breaking In: The Rise of Sonia Sotomayor and the Politics of Justice""

"Washington (CNN) -- House Speaker John Boehner's proposal to avert the looming fiscal cliff's automatic tax increases failed to curry enough Republican support Thursday night, after which Congress left for the holiday with no clear end in sight in the high-stakes debate. Boehner said earlier Thursday that he was confident that his so-called Plan B -- which would extend tax cuts that are set to expire at year's end for most people while allowing rates to increase to 1990s levels on income over $1 million -- would pass the House, and in the process put pressure on President Barack Obama and the Democratic-controlled Senate. But his gambit seemed in doubt later as Republican leaders struggled to get most all their members to sign on -- even enlisting senators like Sen. Rob Portman, to work the House floor -- knowing the chamber's Democrats oppose it. Then, around 8 p.m., House Majority Leader Eric Cantor announced that the measure would not go up for a vote as planned. ""The House did not take up the tax measure today because it did not have sufficient support from our members to pass,"" Boehner said in a statement. ""Now it is up to the president to work with Senator (Harry) Reid on legislation to avert the fiscal cliff."" Democratic leaders already had signaled they oppose the so-called Plan B. After Thursday night's unexpected reversal, Republican legislators walked past reporters through the halls of Congress, and most did not take questions. One who did -- Rep. Jeff Flake, an Arizonan who will move to the Senate next month -- said he was disappointed. ""It's too bad; I'd rather vote on it tonight,"" said Flake, who said he sides with Democrats in backing the extension of tax cuts except for household income of more than $250,000. ""Get it done."" What this means next in the fiscal cliff talks is unclear. From here, scenarios range from intensified and ultimately successful talks in the coming days or entrenchment as the fiscal cliff becomes a reality next year, when a new Congress could enter negotiations with Obama. The Plan B was significant because Republican leaders previously insisted they wouldn't raise rates on anyone, while Obama called tax rates for those earning more than $250,000 threshold to return to 1990s levels while extending tax cuts for everyone else. Although the House didn't vote on Boehner's tax measure, most Republicans did vote together earlier Thursday as the House narrowly approved, 215-209, a related measure to alter automatic spending cuts set to kick in next year under the fiscal cliff, replacing cuts to the military with reductions elsewhere. The Congressional Budget Office said this would lead to $217.7 billion in cuts over the next decade, short of the $1.2 trillion in cuts that would go into effect in January if the fiscal cliff isn't averted. Moments after that vote, the White House issued a statement indicating it would veto this bill. But that should be a moot point, since Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has said he won't bring it up for a vote. Republicans consider piggybacking spending cuts to 'Plan B' ""For weeks, the White House said that if I moved on rates, that they would make substantial concessions on spending cuts and entitlement reforms,"" House Speaker John Boehner said before his plan fell flat. ""I did my part. They've done nothing."" While the Ohio congressman said Obama seems ""unwilling to stand up to his own party on the big issues that face our country,"" Democrats say Republican leaders are buckling to their conservative base by backing off as negotiations seemed to be nearing a deal. White House spokesman Jay Carney called the GOP alternatives ""a major step backwards,"" claiming they'd lead to extended tax cuts of $50,000 for millionaires. Reid slammed the two Republican measures -- the one that passed and the one that wasn't brought up for a vote -- as ""pointless political stunts."" The war of words notwithstanding, Boehner, Carney and Senate Democratic leaders all said they are ready to talk. Reid has said the Senate -- with many members attending a memorial service Friday and funeral in Hawaii on Sunday for Sen. Daniel Inouye -- will be back at work December 27. And after Thursday's session, Cantor's office said legislative business was finished for the week but the House could reconvene after Christmas if needed. ""I remain hopeful,"" Boehner said. ""Our country has big challenges, and the president and I are going to have to work together to solve those challenges."" The path toward the fast-approaching fiscal cliff . The possibility of a fiscal cliff -- which economists warn will hit the American economy hard -- was set in motion two years ago, as a way to force action on mounting government debt. Negotiations between top Congressional Republicans and Democrats resumed after Obama's re-election last month as did the barbs from both sides. Polling has consistently shown most Americans back the president, who insists wealthy Americans must pay more, rather than Boehner and his Republican colleagues, who have balked at tax rate hikes and demanded spending cuts and entitlement program reforms. A new CNN/ORC International survey released Thursday showed that just over half of respondents believe Republicans should give up more in any solution and consider the party's policies too extreme. CNN poll: Are GOP policies too extreme? The two sides seemingly had made progress on forging a $2 trillion deficit reduction deal that included new revenue sought by Obama and spending cuts and entitlement changes desired by Boehner. Senior administration officials said Obama and Boehner have not spoken since Monday, when the president made a counterproposal to a Republican offer over the weekend. The president's offer set $400,000 as the household income threshold for a tax rate increase. It also included a new formula for the consumer price index applied to benefits for programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid to protect against inflation, much to the chagrin of some liberals. The new calculation, called chained CPI, includes assumptions on consumer habits in response to rising prices, such as seeking cheaper alternatives, and would result in smaller benefit increases in future years. Statistics supplied by opponents say the change would mean Social Security recipients would get $6,000 less in benefits over the first 15 years of chained CPI. Boehner essentially halted negotiations by introducing his Plan B on Tuesday. He described it as a fallback option to prevent a sweeping tax increase when tax cuts dating to President George W. Bush's administration expire in two weeks. The spending cut vote -- similar to one passed by the House last year that went nowhere in the Senate -- was added to the docket later Thursday, to appeal to conservative legislators upset about backing a tax increase without acting on spending and protecting the military budget. The House speaker's reasoning was that the passage of Plan B and the spending bill would put the onus on Obama and Senate Democrats to accept them or offer a compromise. For now, the Obama administration won't have to weigh in on the tax part of that scenario. As to the House-approved spending cuts bill, White House spokeswoman Amy Brundage dismissed the GOP alternative as ""nothing more than a dangerous diversion"" for eliminating federal funding by negatively impacting millions of seniors, disabled individuals and poor and at-risk children. In a statement Thursday night, the White House didn't address Thursday's House proceedings but referenced its top priority -- ensuring that 98% of Americans don't see their taxes rise in January. The statement expressed confidence that there will be deal on the fiscal cliff but with no explanation of how, when or what such an agreement would look like. ""The president will work with Congress to get this done, and we are hopeful that we will be able to find a bipartisan solution quickly that protects the middle class and our economy,"" the White House said.

"(CNN) -- The EU police are not about to take your vacuum cleaner away from you. So, stop worrying. But Monday marks the day that super powerful vacuum cleaners that use more than 1600 Watts can no longer be sold in stores in the EU, nor manufactured in EU plants. This should be of no shock to anyone. The rule - intended to improve energy efficiency - was agreed five years ago and manufacturers have reacted accordingly. They may not like it. Dyson for one is looking for a judicial review of the new rule, though it has complied with it. European consumers are used to this. New Wattage rules have already been in effect for light bulbs, televisions, washing machines and refrigerators. But for some reason here in the UK, the vacuum cleaner appears a step too far for the popular press which has noted that the EU is ""sucking"" consumer rights out of Britain, or just that the ""EU Sucks."" There are reports of a jump in sales of the more powerful vacuum cleaners over the weekend before the ban took effect. ""I believe there is a misconception and that is that if you have a high-voltage vac that also means that it has a lot of power to suck the dust,"" the EU spokesperson Marlene Holzner told me last week, dismissing endless columns of ink in Britain that we will have to vacuum for longer periods, hence use more electricity, to clean our homes. Vacuum cleaners will also have those little A-G charts on them so we know how much they cost us to run. There are also new rules on performance and noise levels. Outdoor vacs, wet and dry vacs and industrial vacs are exempt from all the new rules. But that did not make much news in Britain. Not that the EU is stopping there. The Wattage for vacuums will be lowered to a maximum of 900 Watts in 2017. The current limit of 1600 Watts is just a temporary pause on the way to even more energy efficiency. Next year the EU will start to talk about putting other appliances on the list; lawn mowers, mobile phones, hair dryers, kettles (watch out for the British headlines on that one -- EU Blows its Stack, EU Boils Over). Brussels stresses there is no formal, or informal list and there is no guarantee new rules to lower the Wattage on smaller appliances will be adopted. But the goal here is greater energy efficiency. The EU hopes to meet about a third of its power reduction targets in the coming years simply by reducing energy used by appliances. It is finding steps to cut unnecessary power and it sees this as a less painful step on the way to that goal.","Vacuum cleaners that use more than 1600 Watts can no longer be sold in stores in the EU .

"(CNN) -- The Mexican government condemned the U.S. Border Patrol's use of lethal force that resulted in the death of an apparently undocumented migrant on the California-Mexico border this week. The migrant was identified by Mexican authorities as Mexican national Jesus Flores Cruz. ""We also firmly reiterate that the use of lethal force in border control operations is unacceptable. The Government of Mexico expects the results of the investigations and that those responsible be held accountable,"" the Secretariat of Foreign Relations said in a statement Thursday. The Mexican government is seeking a thorough investigation of the incident. Since January 2010, at least 28 individuals have died as the result of an encounter with U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials, said the activist group Southern Border Communities Coalition. At least 27 deaths resulted from the use of lethal force, and one person died after not receiving adequate medical attention, the group said. On Tuesday, a Border Patrol agent shot and killed an apparently undocumented migrant who allegedly threw rocks at the agent, striking his face, on the border near San Diego, authorities said. A social justice advocacy group criticized the Border Patrol's use of deadly force in the incident, saying there's a disturbing trend of Border Patrol ""killings of rock throwers, some of whom were teenagers and some whom were U.S. citizens"" on the U.S.-Mexico border, said Andrea Guerrero, executive director of Alliance San Diego. The Border Patrol declined to comment directly on this week's incident, which is under investigation by local authorities, but in the past, the agency has highlighted how agents are seriously injured in rock-throwing incidents and resort to lethal force to protect themselves. Guerrero said, however, some police experts advise using nonlethal force such as pepper-ball guns to respond to rock throwings. ""Border agents should adhere to best policing practices and only use lethal force as a last resort, not the only resort,"" Guerrero said. Rock-throwing incidents have been controversial on the U.S.-Mexico border, particularly when Mexicans have thrown projectiles from the Mexico side of the international line toward Border Patrol agents on the U.S. side. In some cases, U.S. Border Patrol agents have fired their guns at the rock throwers on the Mexico side of the border, killing the rock thrower. Mexican officials have condemned the Border Patrol's use of lethal force as excessive. The U.S. Border Patrol said the incident occurred in a rugged section of the Otay Mountains near San Diego where the agent was trying to arrest several immigrants who crossed the border illegally. Two other undocumented migrants were arrested and in custody, the agency said. The San Diego County Sheriff's Department, which is investigating the killing, said in its account that two Border Patrol agents were trying to detain a group of suspected undocumented migrants in rugged terrain in the mountain's White Cross area about four miles east of the Otay Mesa border crossing. The border patrol agent who fired his service weapon suffered minor injuries, the sheriff's homicide unit said. CNN's Jaqueline Hurtado contributed to this report.","Mexico calls U.S. Border Patrol's use of lethal force ""unacceptable""

"(CNN) -- It took 14 teams and 45 days of daily intelligence operations to nab one of Colombia's last great crime bosses in Venezuela, an official in that country said. Venezuelan Justice and Interior Minister Tareck El Aissami on Wednesday gave the first detailed account of the capture of accused drug lord Daniel ""El Loco"" Barrera in San Cristobal, Venezuela. The operation to capture Barrera began when Colombian authorities shared intelligence with Venezuela about his whereabouts on August 6, El Aissami said. Venezuela then deployed 14 ""intelligence and search"" teams in three states and the Venezuelan capital to try to locate him. Officials tapped 69 pay phones that may have been used by Barrera to manage his alleged drug empire in Colombia and beyond, the minister said. The monitoring operation stretched for weeks, as Barrera rarely made phone calls himself, preferring to have third parties use the public phones to call Colombia to run the business, El Aissami said. Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos announced the arrest in a televised speech Tuesday. He called Barrera the ""last of the great (crime) bosses"" and said the operation was directed from Washington, with collaboration between British, Colombian, U.S. and Venezuelan authorities. The British intelligence agency MI-6 and the CIA played a role, he said. More: 'Queen of Cocaine' killed in Colombia . The Venezuelan minister, however, did not mention either the United States or Britain and described it as a solely Venezuelan-Colombian operation. The United States and Venezuela have butted heads over anti-drug operations. Venezuela kicked the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration out from the country in 2005, and the United States has published reports questioning Venezuela's anti-drug efforts. This week's arrest is evidence that Venezuela is tough on drug trafficking, El Aissami said. Barrera was in possession of a fake passport under the name of ""Jose Tomas Lucumi Popo,"" the minister said. The alleged drug lord had also undergone multiple plastic surgeries to change his appearance, in both Colombia and Venezuela, he said. In October 2010, Colombian authorities said they found more than $29 million and 17 million euros in cash stashed in two homes that Barrera owned. At the time, the South American country's defense minister called it the ""biggest drug-money seizure operation in the country's history."" Earlier that year, the U.S. Department of the Treasury said Barrera played a significant role in international drug trafficking and described him as one of Colombia's most-wanted drug traffickers, noting in a statement that the Colombian government had offered a $2.5 million reward for information leading to his capture. The statement said Barrera operated primarily in the eastern plains of Colombia, between the capital of Bogota and the Venezuelan border. An indictment unsealed in a Florida federal court in September 2011 accuses Barrera of conspiring to manufacture, distribute and import cocaine into the United States. If convicted on those charges, he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison, the U.S. Attorney's Office said at the time. More: Mexico police capture alleged cartel leader .

"(CNN) -- Jacqueline Kennedy was still wearing the blood-stained watermelon pink suit when she got to the White House in the early-morning hours after her husband was shot dead. She had refused to take it off at Parkland Hospital in Dallas or on the flight back to Washington with the body of her husband. Once at the White House, her personal maid put the suit in a bag so Mrs. Kennedy wouldn't have to look at it. In the words of President John F. Kennedy, she looked ""smashing"" in the suit, which may be why the President asked Jackie to wear the now-famous outfit to Dallas on November 22, 1963. The suit looked like a Coco Chanel, it was actually a knockoff, made in the United States. The first lady wore it at least six times before that fateful day. She was known for her fashion sense. Museums have hosted collections of her gowns, hats and jewelry. In Fort Worth on the morning of November 22, the President even joked about his wife's style. ""Two years ago, I introduced myself in Paris by saying that I was the man who had accompanied Mrs. Kennedy to Paris. I am getting somewhat that same sensation as I travel around Texas. Nobody wonders what Lyndon (Johnson) and I wear,"" Kennedy quipped. Hours later, Jackie Kennedy was trying to crawl out of the presidential limo, her suit spattered with her husband's blood. When aides suggested she change her clothes, she refused. ""Her remark, I think she made it more than once is, 'No, I'm going to leave these clothes on. I want them to see what they have done,' "" author Philip Shenon said. JFK assassination a collective memory for American children . Hours later, Kennedy continued to wear the suit during the emergency swearing in of Johnson as President. ""That whole scene is obviously just surreal,"" Shenon said. ""She arrives in the cabin in Air Force One in these clothes, covered with the President's blood, and she's expected to stand there and witness the swearing in of her husband's successor."" The suit today is in the National Archives building in Maryland. It came in a box, along with a handwritten note from Jackie Kennedy's mother on her personal stationery. It read simply: ""Jackie's suit and bag - worn November 22nd, 1963."" The suit was never cleaned. The public hasn't seen the suit since the assassination and won't for another 90 years. Opinion: 50 years on, the enduring lessons of JFK's presidency . In 2003, nine years after her mother's death, Caroline Kennedy gave the suit as a gift to the people of the United States with the understanding that it would not be put on display until 2103. And even then, the Kennedy family will have to be consulted before any attempt is made to display it. They want to avoid sensationalizing the horrible act. Also hidden from view in the new archives building in Maryland: the blue blouse Jackie Kennedy wore beneath the pink suit, her stockings, blue shoes and blue purse. What they don't have is the first lady's iconic pink pillbox hat. ""The hat is a mystery,"" said Shenon, who wrote ""A Cruel and Shocking Act."" ""The hat apparently goes to the Secret Service initially and the Secret Service turns it over to Mrs. Kennedy's private secretary, and then it disappears. It has not been seen since."" The archive has the suit stored in a windowless vault, in an acid free container, where the air is changed three times an hour to properly maintain the wool and cloth. It is kept at a temperature of 65 to 68 degrees, which is best for the fabric. Boy who witnessed JFK assassination recalls the day .","The suit was a knockoff of a Coco Chanel design .

"(CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry will not use the term war to describe Washington's impending military action against the jihadist group ISIS in Syria and Iraq, but others in the Obama administration aren't shying away from the word. What's in a name? On Wednesday night, the war-stopping, Nobel Peace Prize-winning President used a nationally televised address to announce a plan to ""dismantle and ultimately destroy"" the Sunni jihadists who have taunted America by beheading two captive U.S. journalists. ""We will hunt down terrorists who threaten our country, wherever they are,"" he said. ""That means I will not hesitate to take action against ISIL in Syria, as well as Iraq."" The administration, of course, prefers the term ISIL while many others go with ISIS, but that's another story. The seeds of uncertainly over what to call the ISIS-ISIL campaign were planted by Kerry on Thursday, who told CNN in an interview that the United States was not at war with ISIS, saying the administration's strategy includes ""many different things that one doesn't think of normally in context of war."" ""What we are doing is engaging in a very significant counterterrorism operation,"" Kerry told CNN's Elise Labott in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. ""It's going to go on for some period of time. If somebody wants to think about it as being a war with ISIL, they can do so, but the fact is it's a major counterterrorism operation that will have many different moving parts."" On Thursday, Deputy State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf sought to clarify the lexicon of the anti-ISIS campaign. ""Well, I know there has been a lot of questions about what words we use but as the president said the other night this is a very different campaign from the Iraq War, the last time we used that term,"" she said. ""It will not involve American combat troops fighting on foreign soil. We utilize our air superiority and support for partner forces on the ground."" Instead, she calls the action ""a steady, relentless counterterrorism campaign to take out ISIL wherever they exist."" ""This is not also America's war with ISIL,"" she added. ""The world is joining us in the fight because of the threat they pose to countries in the regions. So we are at war with ISIL in the same way we are at war with al Qaeda and its affiliates around the world."" White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest on Friday said it was ISIL that had ""indicated that they are ready to go to war against the world and this president, as is expected of American presidents, is stepping up to lead an international coalition to confront that threat."" He added, ""Ultimately, this international coalition will be responsible for degrading and destroying ISIL. So I think what you can conclude from this is the United States is at war with ISIL the same way that we are at war with al Qaeda and al Qaeda affiliates all around the globe."" The Pentagon had a similar take. The United States is at war with ISIL ""in the same way we're at war and continue to be at war with al Qaeda and its affiliates,"" press secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby said. ""There's not going to be a purely military solution to the threat that ISIL poses in the region, specifically inside Iraq,"" Kirby said. ""There's not going to be a military solution here.""","John Kerry will not use the term war to describe Washington's impending military action .

"(CNN) -- A bareheaded motorcyclist participating in a ride to protest mandatory helmet laws was killed when he was thrown over the handlebars in Onondaga, New York. Philip A. Contos, 55, of Parish, New York, was on a ride organized by the Onondaga chapter of American Bikers Aimed Towards Education (ABATE), state police said Sunday. Contos hit his brakes, began fishtailing and lost control of his 1983 Harley Davidson. He shot over the handlebars, hit his head on the pavement and was taken to Upstate University Hospital in Syracuse, New York, where he was pronounced dead. State police say evidence at the scene plus information from the attending medical expert indicated Contos would have survived had he been wearing a helmet as required by state law. Asked about the apparent irony of Contos' death, the statewide president of ABATE, Thomas Alton, said, ""We are riding at an increased risk and accept that. ... This individual was a seasoned rider, not a newbie. He made an adult decision. A full decision to ride in the manner he rode in."" Another New Yorker who has been a motorcyclist for over 50 years, Joseph Costantini, said, ""I would never ride without a helmet -- even in a state that says you don't have to. I understand where the protesters are coming from because ultimately it's a matter of choice. For me, I would wear a helmet no matter what. ... Must feel great to ride without a helmet because sometimes it's uncomfortable. ... I'm sure his family isn't going to be happy."" Motorcycle helmet use dropped from 67% in 2009 to 54% in 2010, according to a press release issued by the Governors Highway Safety Association. ""This is another sad and tragic example where we have lost someone due to the lack of wearing a helmet,"" said Jonathan Adkins, communications director for the association. According to Alton, a large percentage of motorcycle fatalities are due to inexperience and drivers not seeing motorcyclists when switching lanes or making turns. ABATE of NY Inc. is organizing a memorial ""to honor an individual who rode for freedom and risked his all for freedom,"" he said. A formal date is still to be determined.

"(CNN) -- Twenty milligrams; that's the average amount of carbon emissions generated from the time it took you to read the first two words of this article. How green is your website? Calculating all the factors involved in a website can be tricky. Now, depending on how quickly you read, around 80, perhaps even 100 milligrams of C02 have been released. And in the several minutes it will take you to get to the end of this story, the number of milligrams of greenhouse gas emitted could be several thousand, if not more. This may not seem like a lot: ""But in aggregate, if you consider all the people visiting a web site and then all the seconds that each of them spends on it, it turns out to be a large number,"" says Dr. Alexander Wissner-Gross, an Environmental Fellow at Harvard University who studies the environmental impact of computing. Wissner-Gross estimates every second someone spends browsing a simple web site generates roughly 20 milligrams of C02. Whether downloading a song, sending an email or streaming a video, almost every single activity that takes place in the virtual environment has an impact on the real one. As millions more go online each year some researchers say the need to create a green Internet ecosystem is not only imperative but also urgent. ""It is part of the whole sustainability picture,"" Chris Large, head of research and development at UK-based Climate Action Group, told CNN. ""Scientists are saying to us that we have 10 years to take some serious action to avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change so taking some sort of initiative is absolutely vital."" A number of studies have highlighted the growing energy demands of computers. A 2007 report from research firm Gartner, for example, estimates the manufacturing, use and disposal of information and communications technology generates about two percent of the world's greenhouse gases -- similar to the level produced by the entire aviation industry.  Watch the report on efforts to turn tech green » . Anti-virus software firm McAfee reports that the electricity needed just to transmit the trillions of spam emails sent annually equals the amount required to power over two million homes in the United States while producing the same level of greenhouse gas emissions as more than three million cars. ""Most people don't appreciate that the computer on your desk is contributing to global warming and that if its electricity comes from a coal power plant it produces as much C02 as a sports utility vehicle,"" said Bill St. Arnaud of Canarie, a Canada-based internet development organization. ""Some studies estimate the internet will be producing 20 percent of the world's greenhouse gases in a decade. That is clearly the wrong direction. That is clearly unsustainable,"" added St. Arnaud. What do you include when working out IT's carbon footprint? Calculating the carbon footprint of the entire web however is not as easy as measuring the greenhouse gas emissions of a car. Data centers -- massive buildings housing hundreds, if not thousands, of power hungry servers storing everything from Facebook photos and YouTube videos to company web sites and personal emails -- are often labeled as the worst offenders when it comes to harming the environment. In 2002, global data center emissions amounted to 76 million tons of carbon dioxide -- a figure that is likely to more than triple over the next decade, according to a 2008 study by the Climate Group and Global e-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI). The footprint of network infrastructure, which is responsible for transporting information from data centers to personal computers, mobile phones and other devices, is harder to pinpoint. However the same study estimates fixed broadband accounts for around four million tons of carbon emissions and could account for nearly 50 million tons of emissions by 2020. The manufacturing, transport and use of personal computers and laptops also has what some say is the most significant impact, producing roughly 200 million tons of emissions in 2002. As millions of people buy new laptops and computers every year, this figure could triple by the end of the next decade, according to the Climate Group report. And it is also true that, like driving a car compared to taking public transportation, some online activities produce more greenhouse gases than others. More electricity is needed to store, transmit and download a video compared to a simple email, for example. A single search using Google releases 0.2 grams of C02 into the atmosphere, according to Google. ""And what that includes is the energy that we at Google use to be able to receive your search, process it and then send it back to you,"" Erik Teetzel, one of Google's ""green"" engineers, told CNN. ""If people are counting things outside the activity that we do, then we don't have control over that so we don't factor that into the equation,"" said Teetzel. ""We can measure exactly the number of queries that we service and come up with a very accurate estimate and answer from measured results of our actual emissions or energy use per query that we serve."" The drive for energy efficiency . Citing competitive reasons, Teetzel declined to divulge Google's annual power bill, yet he said the internet company has been taking steps to make its main six, five megawatt server farms green as well as the other, smaller data centers it has around the world. It is doing this by using more renewable energy, recycled water and efficient software that requires less electricity to run. ""From a business perspective, it makes sense to get the most what you want to call useful work done using the least amount of resources,"" said Teetzel. ""Our energy efficiency efforts really did stem from us making our business more competitive."" A number of other companies are also working to take the various pieces that comprise the infrastructure of the internet in a more sustainable direction. Wissner-Gross of Harvard has a company called C02Stats that enables businesses to monitor and manage the environmental impact of their web sites and then purchase renewable energy certificates based on their sites' monthly carbon footprint. Netherlands-based Cleanbits lobbies web sites to go green by either by purchasing carbon offsets or switching to green hosting providers, like AISO.net, a solar-powered data center based in California. And, like Google, Yahoo also incorporates renewable power and other efficiency measures in its data centers. However as more of the world joins an age characterized by global flows of information and communication, some say the role the internet plays in making the lives of millions not only more efficient but also environmentally friendly should not be discounted.

""That is why you and I use the internet now to find out a lot of information that would have previously been found by us getting in a car and driving somewhere."" ""It is a little bit unfair to say that you have this huge carbon cost of the IT industry without articulating the fact that in many, many cases it offsets what I would call heavier, more carbon intense activities that we do in our daily lives,"" he added.

"Washington (CNN) -- The CIA is collecting bulk records on international money transfers, using the same Patriot Act legal authority that has become the center of controversy in U.S. surveillance programs, a source told CNN. A person familiar with the program said the agency's efforts are an outgrowth of terror finance-tracking programs that were established in the wake of the September 11, 2001, terror attacks and revealed that al Qaeda funded the hijackers using methods such as smuggled cash, money transfers, and credit and debit cards. The Treasury Department and the National Security Agency have other programs that similarly focus on financial transaction data. The CIA program provides some redundancies intended to catch transactions that may not draw attention in other programs. The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times first reported the existence of the CIA program Thursday night, saying it has sparked concerns from lawmakers. The revelation comes amid debate in the United States over whether to pare back some surveillance in light of privacy concerns raised after former NSA contractor Edward Snowden leaked documents describing secret spy programs. The CIA program focuses on transfers that the agency believes could be the source of terrorism financing and that use services such as MoneyGram and Western Union. The vast majority are purely non-U.S. transactions, but it includes some transactions to or from the United States. Such U.S.-related transactions could raise concerns about data of U.S. people, which the CIA is generally prohibited from collecting. The court that oversees Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act has established legal rules governing the CIA program, as it has with NSA surveillance programs, and requires evidence of a connection to potential terrorism before data belonging to U.S. people can be accessed, the person familiar with the program said. The agency works with the FBI to target potential financing of terrorism. A U.S. intelligence official said any activity in such programs includes what the government calls ""minimization procedures to protect U.S. person information"" and court-approved restrictions on specially trained analysts who can query the data, and on the length of time such data is allowed to be retained. The CIA said it doesn't comment on ""alleged intelligence sources or methods."" Dean Boyd, a CIA spokesman, said that ""the CIA protects the nation and upholds the privacy rights of Americans by ensuring that its intelligence collection activities are focused on acquiring foreign intelligence and counterintelligence in accordance with U.S. laws."" Boyd said that the agency's activities are overseen by Senate and House intelligence committees, the FISA court, the Justice Department and other agencies. A Western Union spokesman said: ""We collect consumer information to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act and other laws. In doing so, we also protect our consumers' privacy and work to prevent consumer fraud."" CNN also received a similar statement from MoneyGram. ""We value our customers' privacy and work hard to protect it, just as we work hard to protect customers and others from fraud and other crime. We comply with the laws of all the countries where we do business, including the laws that govern privacy, government investigations, and compliance with lawful subpoenas and court orders,"" the company said. ""We have reporting obligations related to suspicious transactions, money laundering and other financial crimes around the world. The laws to which we are subject generally prohibit us from discussing details."" While the details of the CIA program provide new information on the scope of Patriot Act bulk records collection, U.S. government monitoring of financial transaction data has become well known since 9/11. The 9/11 attacks cost al Qaeda between $400,000 and $500,000 to carry out, according to the 9/11 Commission, and the plotters transferred much of the money through readily detectable means via banks, money-transfers, travelers checks, and credit and debit cards. At the time, the financial transactions didn't raise any flags. Among the transactions uncovered after the attacks were MoneyGram and Western Union money transfers, the commission said. Since the attacks the United States has tightened banking rules. The government collects data from the Belgian-based Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or SWIFT, which operates a global system that helps banks clear financial transactions. Banks, money transfer outfits and casinos are also required by the United States to flag suspicious transactions under the Bank Secrecy Act, which also is the law used to police money laundering and other illicit financial transactions.","CIA collects bulk records on international money moves, says source .

"(CNN) -- Authorities warned of high temperatures and strong winds Sunday as hundreds of firefighters battle a northern Colorado blaze that has destroyed almost 200 homes. A warning is in effect until 8 p.m. local time, fire officials said, with temperatures expected to be in the 90s and wind gusts of up to 50 mph. The High Park Fire is west of Fort Collins, and has burned more than 55,000 acres so far. It is about 45% contained. More than 1,600 firefighters were battling the blaze. It has destroyed at least 181 homes, according to a statement posted on InciWeb, a U.S. multiagency fire response website. ""The assessment is still under way and this number will continue to grow,"" the statement said. The blaze has moved through forests and neighborhoods, forcing thousands of evacuations and leaving a trail of destruction. It has claimed one life, a 62-year-old woman found dead in her burned home last week. ""It will be some time before this fire is out, but our challenge now is to make sure we do everything to contain the damage,"" said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, who oversees the Forest Service. Vilsack toured the Colorado blaze and said it is one of thousands burning nationwide. The National Weather Service has issued warnings of high chances of wildfire activity in nine states, including Colorado. Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper said a tree struck by lightning about a week ago sparked the mammoth blaze in his state. Elsewhere in Colorado, firefighters are battling an 11,600-acre fire near Pagosa Springs that broke out last month. That blaze is 30% contained. Meanwhile Sunday, a new fire broke out and quickly spread to 200 acres near Pueblo, forcing some evacuations of residents. In New Mexico, the Whitewater Baldy complex has scorched more than 290,000 acres, the agriculture secretary said. Hundreds of firefighters from across the United States are helping local departments battle the blaze. Inciweb reports 303 personnel on site. The blaze was 75% contained as of Sunday. CNN's Greg Morrison contributed to this report.","The High Park Fire destroys at least 181 homes .

"(CNN) -- Islamic militants ambushed Ethiopian forces in southern Somalia Saturday and hours-long fighting left scores of people dead. The fierce firefights killed 86 Al-Shabaab fighters, said Diyad Abdi Kalil, a commander of the transitional government in Somalia's Gedo province. The militants ambushed the soldiers in the town of Yurkut, still under Somali control. In recent weeks, Somali government forces, backed by their Ethiopian allies, have retaken southern towns controlled by Al-Shabaab, including strategically important Baidoa. The gun battles lasted almost five hours, Kalil said, and erupted a day after the African Union announced that Ethiopia planned to withdraw its troops from Somalia by the end of April. Paddy Ankunda, spokesman for the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) said forces from Djibouti, Uganda and Burundi will replace the Ethiopians. Meanwhile, Sheikh Abu Musab, the military spokesman of Al-Shabaab claimed on a local radio station that its fighters killed 73 soldiers, mostly Ethiopians, in Saturday's fighting. The Islamist group has waged an insurgency against the feeble Transitional Federal Government since 2007 but is now on the defensive in its heartland in southern Somalia. It announced last month that it was tightening its ties to al Qaeda and has long been considered a terrorist movement by the United States. AMISOM and government forces drove Al-Shabaab fighters from the center of the Somali capital Mogadishu last year, while Kenyan troops crossed into southern Somalia in October to hit back for a rash of kidnappings it blamed on the group. That Kenyan operation is ongoing. After it began, Ethiopian troops joined Somali government units in attacking Al-Shabaab strongholds.","Al-Shabaab fighters ambush Ethiopian forces .

"(CNN) -- Mark Engle saw thick smoke billow through the air outside his Colorado home on Tuesday. From a window, he watched deer grazing in his backyard, driven out of the forest by flames that have devoured thousands of acres of land only a few miles away. His children's backpacks were placed by the door, stuffed with their favorite toys. His family is packed and ready to leave in a hurry, Engle said. But they want to stay put, even though authorities have ordered residents in the area to evacuate. Only three to four miles away from the home he shares with his wife and three children, a fast-moving wildfire has consumed nearly 43,500 acres in northern Colorado. The flames, which authorities said were caused by lightning, have destroyed more than 100 structures and left one person dead. ""There's a number of people like myself, (for whom) packing up and leaving when you have livestock and animals just isn't as easy as if you have just a house,"" Engle said. He'd like to think he won't have to. Firefighters gained some control Tuesday, especially on the eastern flank, Larimer County Sheriff's Office spokesman John Schulz said. President Barack Obama telephoned Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper on Tuesday and said his administration is already making personnel, equipment and federal grants available to the state, said White House spokesman Josh Earnest. As of Tuesday, there were 40 fire engines and 17 fire crews battling the blaze, said Bill Hahnenberg, the incident commander. Officials want to increase that to 100 engines and 34 crews by Wednesday, Hahnenberg said. First measured at two acres early Saturday, the High Park Fire has grown exponentially in the time since, including more than doubling in size Sunday and again overnight into Monday. But the nearby flames weren't Engle's most immediate concern. Police roadblocks prevented his family from getting supplies, he said. ""Even if we leave to get a gallon of milk they won't let us back in,"" he said. Engle said he and his neighbors feel frustrated that there is no leeway. ""I parked on the side of the road and walked up to the officers to discuss whether or not I could pack up my animals and move them out then come back,"" he said. ""But they told me if I leave, bar none, I would not be allowed to return."" Engle said the officers told him if he crossed the line, his wife and children would ""just have to figure their own way out."" ""They even told me it was a good thing I parked where I did because if I'd crossed I wouldn't be able to go back,"" he said. Schulz, the sheriff's spokesman, said he can sympathize with residents' frustration, but that it would be ""irresponsible"" to allow anyone into an evacuated area. Photos: Northern Colorado fire rages on . He said the evacuation orders are mandatory, though the police won't force anyone to leave their home. ""If after we've evacuated the area and then they decide they're going to run to the store and get groceries and come back, well, no,"" he said. ""We're not going to force you to leave, but once you're out you're not getting back in because we believe that area is unsafe."" The department does have special teams to go into evacuated areas -- when there is no eminent danger -- to retrieve livestock or essential items like medication that have been left behind, he said. ""If they don't leave, there is likely not going to be anybody available to come help them when the fire is on them,"" he said. ""And we're not going to put firefighters or deputies at risk trying to come back into an area to save them."" One person has died in the fire: a 62-year-old woman identified by family members as Linda Steadman. Her body was found inside her burned home. The ""mother, grandmother, sister and wife perished in the cabin she loved,"" the family said. A pre-evacuation is under way in an area covering at least 89 more homes, said Nick Christensen, executive officer of the sheriff's office. That means residents are being asked to prepare for an evacuation if one is ordered. Some of those evacuated Monday could do nothing but watch as firefighters doused the dry, hilly terrain, hoping their homes would be saved. But Kyle Ellis knew it was too late for his house. He struggled to tell his young daughter why the fire moved so quickly, why they no longer had a house to go home to, CNN affiliate KUSA reported. ""Fire burns real fast, real hot, real dry,"" he said. He kissed the young girl on the cheek and told her she would get a new home. Are wildfires near you?

"(CNN) -- Forecasters are expecting warmer than normal temperatures and gusty winds Tuesday in a northern Colorado area already ravaged by a wildfire, not a good combination for the legion of firefighters trying to extinguish the blaze. The High Park Fire had consumed 59,500 acres of woodland by Tuesday, but it was about 50% contained, authorities reported. Tuesday's forecast by the National Weather Service is similar to Monday's blazing heat and winds that whipped up the blaze. But firefighters say they can handle the weather conditions because winds are expected to be less ""tough"" than what they experienced on Sunday. iReport: Photos capture smoke choking Colorado sky . ""The expected winds were not as strong as they were. The amount of fire activity in the big timber on the western perimeter was not as extreme,"" fire information officer Brett Haberstick said, according to CNN affiliate KCNC. ""We have a lot less smoke and a lot better working conditions for the crews."" More than 1,700 personnel were battling the blaze. Lighting ignited the fire that started on June 9 and has destroyed 189 homes. That number is expected to grow, and firefighters are also concerned that the blaze could shift toward dense stands of trees that have been killed by beetle infestations, according to InciWeb, a U.S. multiagency fire response website. The blaze has moved through forests and neighborhoods, forcing thousands of evacuations and leaving a trail of destruction. It has claimed the life of a 62-year-old woman found dead in her burned home last week. Elsewhere in Colorado, firefighters are battling a fire near Pagosa Springs that broke out last month. That blaze, also blamed on lightning, had grown to more than 13,000 acres by Monday night and was 30% contained. And a new fire broke out Sunday and quickly spread to 200 acres near Pueblo, forcing some evacuations of residents. In New Mexico, the Whitewater Baldy Fire has scorched more than 296,000 acres, the agriculture secretary said. More than 3,200 fire personnel from across the United States are helping local departments battle the fire, which began on May 16. The blaze was 82% contained as of Monday. In North Carolina, a wildfire doubled overnight in the Croatan National Forest along the Atlantic coast, U.S. Forest Service officials said Tuesday. Donald Simon, a Forest Service spokesperson, said the blaze has consumed 21,248 acres since Saturday, including 6,000 acres that were intentionally set afire Monday night in a fire-control effort. The wildfire is 20% contained and isn't threatening structures, officials said. A large portion of the fire is in the Sheep Ridge Wilderness area, officials said.

"(CNN) -- Most craftsmen bask in glory when others admire and gush over their art, but a compliment is the last thing Christie Erickson wants. ""I don't want the general public to know what I do is fake,"" Erickson says. ""It's best if it's not noticed at all."" Erickson is an ocularist, or trained technician who makes prosthetic eyes. While some call it a skill, Erickson says recreating the ""personality,"" ""emotion"" and ""sparkle"" conveyed in a person's eye is an art. Each eye ""tells a story and reflects a lot,"" Erickson explains. Erickson and her son Todd Cranmore are two of the six ocularists in the state of Washington and among the few hundred in the country. Because no school teaches ocularistry, people who want to enter the profession must spend 10,000 hours, or five years, of apprenticeship to become certified. The career blends the fields of art and science -- as only people with a creative side and anatomical knowledge can duplicate the organ that gives the gift of sight. It's a common misconception that prosthetic eyes are made of glass, but they're actually designed using acrylic materials and paint. The only nonacrylic piece is the silk thread placed on the eye's surface to simulate veins. Today, no member of the American Society of Ocularists, which includes 200 professional ocularists in the United States and Canada, makes glass eyes, according to Christine Boehm, the society's education chairwoman. She explained that acrylic eyes last longer, fit easier and can better match the color of the original eye. ""There aren't many people left who make glass eyes,"" says Boehm, who has been an ocularist for more than 25 years in Toronto. The art of eye making dates back to the fifth century B.C., when Romans and Egyptians painted clay eyes and wore them over eye sockets. In the 1500s, the Venetians crafted blown-glass eyes that could be worn inside the sockets, but the globes were uncomfortable and sometimes shattered. It wasn't until World War II that eye makers switched from glass to acrylic, because Americans couldn't import glass from Germany. To their delight, ocularists found acrylic eyes didn't break like glass ones and the material was more flexible to mold. For several decades, stock eyes were mass produced as a one-size-fits-all concept. But production has since evolved into the handmade craft of today that brings makers and patients together to custom fit the perfect eye. Erickson, who has crafted prosthetic eyes for 30 years, took up the trade after her son Tim lost his eye in an accident. Tim, who was 3 years old at the time, was watching his father fix a tractor when a bolt flew off into his eye. Tim was rushed to the hospital for emergency surgery, but the eye was damaged beyond repair. The Ericksons decided to get Tim a prosthetic eye before he entered kindergarten so kids wouldn't taunt him about his shrunken and callused eye. ""We wanted him of course to be whole again and have nobody notice it,"" Erickson says, adding that she would have traded places with her son if she could have. ""You're watching your child go through this, you'd give anything to have it be yourself instead of them,"" she says. After agonizing over Tim's lost sight and overcoming the pain by seeing him ""made whole"" again, Erickson decided she wanted to help others erase the suffering she had felt. Erickson apprenticed in between raising four kids, and eight years later she had her professional ocularist license. Erickson's younger son Todd tossed around the idea of attending medical school, but ultimately decided to follow his mother's path and become an ocularist. The two run Erickson Labs Northwest in Kirkland, Washington, where thousands of patients have come through their doors. Erickson, 58, and Cranmore, 36, make their patients' eyes together. While Cranmore says he has friends who could never work with their mothers, both Erickson and Cranmore say they love collaborating on a project that takes 30 to 40 hours to complete. ""It's helpful to have someone come in who hasn't been staring at (an eye) for an hour and a half and say, 'Oh, you're missing this color' or 'I think you need to start again,' which thankfully doesn't happen that often,"" Cranmore joked. Despite being a very specialized field, it's not in danger of losing professionals. Similar to Erickson and Cranmore's business, the art form tends to be passed down within families. Members of the American Society of Ocularists are mostly second-, third- and fourth-generation ocularists. Most patients seek a prosthetic eye -- which costs around $3,000 -- after an accident or disease such as cancer or diabetes. Erickson says more people lose their eyes to disease than injuries today, but she has seen accidents involving bungee cords, golf balls and rocks flying out of lawn mowers. ""There's still the typical 'Christmas Story' of the BB gun injuries,"" she added. Less than 1% of the population requires an ocular prosthesis, according to Boehm, who says she often sees people in public who could benefit from one. ""I think there are a lot of people out there that don't realize they would be a good candidate for an ocular prosthesis, and they don't realize that's something they can get,"" she says. Marysville, Washington, resident J.D. Blackwell, who lost an eye in a skiing accident 16 years ago, recently got a prosthetic eye from Erickson. He compared his new blue eye to contact lenses. ""When you first get them, you're quite aware of them, but after a while, you don't even notice it,"" Blackwell says. In the past few months Blackwell has worn the eye, he's noticed a difference in the way people respond to him. He pointed out one interaction with a Costco employee stationed at the exit. ""About 10 feet before I got to her, she gasped and said, 'Oh, my God, you've got the most gorgeous blue eyes,' "" he recounts while laughing. Erickson wishes no one needed her talents but says she's honored when patients let her into their lives to aid the healing process. ""It's an amazing thing to be able to be a part of somebody's life and that transformation from the tragedy, the grief ... and for us to be able to just heal, pray and love them through it,"" Erickson says. ""And also (give them) a dang good-looking eye.""","Christie Erickson became an ocularist after her son lost his eye in an accident .

"(CNN) -- New York City has seen a jarring last-minute twist in the race for mayor, in which the current mayor, Michael Bloomberg, may have given a crucial boost to the person he would probably least like to see succeed him in City Hall. Bill de Blasio, who surged into the lead among the Democrats running for mayor, has been campaigning for months as a progressive bent on governing in a way that alters or reverses many of Bloomberg's cherished policies -- starting with de Blasio's proposal to raise taxes on households earning $500,000 or more per year. De Blasio, who is married to a black woman, has also made a series of campaign ads that include his biracial teenage children. Bloomberg, in a magazine interview, dismissed de Blasio's campaign as ""class warfare and racist."" Asked to explain the inflammatory charge, Bloomberg said de Blasio is ""making an appeal using his family to gain support. I think it's pretty obvious to anyone watching what he's been doing. I do not think he himself is racist. It's comparable to me pointing out I'm Jewish in attracting the Jewish vote."" The comment is, on its face, questionable. Click here and look at the videos for yourself. If de Blasio is using his telegenic family to good effect, it's no different from what candidates have been doing for centuries. If the comment was intended to halt de Blasio's momentum, it surely failed -- and appears to have backfired -- with the most relevant audience, the active Democratic base likely to turn out on primary day. In fact, within hours of publication of the mayor's remarks, de Blasio was using the dust-up as part of a fund-raising appeal to supporters. Gov. Andrew Cuomo sided with de Blasio as well. ""The comments that were reported clearly are out of line and have no place in our political discourse,"" Cuomo told reporters. ""There's plenty of substantive issues to be discussing without raising unnecessary and inflammatory topics."" The dust-up is more than just an ill-timed misstatement by Bloomberg. It may also illustrate his frustration and impatience after months of bashing by the Democratic mayoral candidates. A self-made billionaire who is the wealthiest person in New York, Bloomberg does not suffer fools gladly. ""Hizzoner has a few choice words for you if he doesn't like your policy idea, but his words of choice are usually variations of dumb and stupid,"" the Daily News noted earlier this year. ""Mayor Bloomberg has the unlovely habit of hearing all sides of a question -- for about 60 seconds, when he trots out his personal thought-stopper: 'Let's get serious,'"" columnist Richard Brookhiser noted in 2005. ""This means that he is serious, you are not. He is smart, you are dumb. He has billions, you do not."" Keep in mind that this bracing assessment by Brookhiser comes from a nationally known conservative who was explaining why he intended to vote for Bloomberg. This is not a warm and cuddly mayor. But New Yorkers are looking for someone who is more empathetic: In a recent poll, 65% of New Yorkers said they want the city to move in a different direction. And a comparable percentage said that an endorsement from Bloomberg would have no effect or make them less likely to support a candidate. In addition to swallowing that tough reality, Bloomberg has recently encountered setbacks that foreshadow the dropping of the final curtain on his administration at the end of the year. Over Bloomberg's strenuous objections, federal courts have appointed monitors to oversee hiring in the city's fire department (which is currently 3.4% black) and to reduce and restructure the police department's use of stop-and-frisk tactics. The normally toothless City Council overrode two Bloomberg vetoes to create an NYPD inspector general and to make it easier for citizens to sue if they think the police have illegally profiled them. De Blasio championed virtually all of the lawsuits and legislation that led to additional oversight of Bloomberg's agencies, and specifically campaigned on his opposition to Bloomberg. And de Blasio's call to tax the city's wealthy -- with the proceeds used to pay for pre-kindergarten and afterschool programs for children -- is anathema to the mayor, who called the plan ""about as dumb a policy as anyone could think of."" That sort of dismissive comment means one thing coming from a billionaire at the helm of city government. But if, as expected, de Blasio finishes first in the Democratic primary on Tuesday, it will signal something else entirely: the tolling of the bell making clear that the 12-year reign of Michael Bloomberg is, unmistakably, coming to a close. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Errol Louis.","Errol Louis: In interview NY Mayor Bloomberg called de Blasio's campaign ""racist""

"(CNN) -- On ABC's ""This Week"" on Sunday, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, who happens to be black, suggested that opposition to him and President Barack Obama in part is due to racial animus. For that, he has been vilified. He has been accused of trying to scare people to the polls (as if listening to the evening news wouldn't already do that), stoking racial divisions and throwing down the race card. And he is asked rhetorically ""is it possible to oppose Obama and not be a racist?"" The response to the attorney general's words has been very heated, and there is an obvious explanation. ""This Week"" allowed many whites to hear what a black man is thinking about race. Most whites don't know because most whites don't have interracial conversations about race. To be fair, neither do most blacks. It's just that we know what other blacks are thinking because, well, we talk to other blacks about race. ""This Week"" allowed a window into the thinking about race from a black person's perspective. That is unusual, given the dearth of guests of color on shows such as ""This Week."" If anything, this points out the need for white America to hear more voices from people of color. But if you look at Holder's actual words, there really isn't anything surprising, or especially bold, in what he said. He said: ""There's a certain racial component to this for some people. I don't think this is the thing that is a main driver, but for some, there's a racial animus."" Let's review: He said ""I don't think this is the thing that is a main driver,"" but it is as if when certain whites hear the word race (or a derivative) as the explanation for any part of an event, they go situationally deaf. Poll after poll shows how blacks and whites view our country through different lenses. Consider a recent Gallup poll that asked whether the justice system was biased against blacks. While 69% of whites answered no, 68% of blacks answered yes. How does this happen? Because by and large when talking about race in America, whites have conversations with other whites and blacks have conversations with other blacks. What Holder said is very different from what whites who don't talk to blacks generally hear. As I tell my students when I teach about race and the law, I note that important breakthroughs on race can only come when you have a conversation with someone who doesn't look like you and doesn't think like you. But this is not a level playing field. Blacks and whites can look at the same event and come up with completely different perceptions. When a black person says this is about race, many whites say we're playing the race card. But when a white person says this has nothing to do with race, rarely does he or she ever get called on it. In this case, Holder, a black man, very gently said race could ... maybe... possibly have something to do with a piece of it, and look at what happened. Let's take a few examples that to me show unprecedented hostility directed toward the President, in my opinion, because he is black. First, the utter nonsense about the President's birth certificate; it refuses to die -- it is actively kept alive -- despite all the evidence to the contrary. Second, the number of pictures or posters at rallies with the President's face on a monkey's body. Third, Congressman Joe Wilson yells ""you lie"" during the President's State of the Union Address. If anything, Holder was too tepid in his analysis, but I'm sure that's a function of his knowing that whenever he says anything about race, he gets pummeled. The real lesson for me is the paucity of guests with the same views as Holder who are given a national platform the way that he was. If week after week, on issue after issue, blacks were invited on as guests and allowed to inform the discussion, after a while, there would be fewer and fewer instances of situational deafness. Whites would come to understand that there is more than one way of looking at something -- especially when it comes to race -- and when it comes to race, would not ignore the expertise that lies in black voices.","Attorney General Eric Holder said ""racial animus"" in part drives opposition to Obama .
Dorothy Brown: For saying what a black man is thinking about race, Holder's now being vilified .
Brown: His remarks were mild, not shocking; whites too rarely get perspectives of blacks .
Brown: It's not often that someone with Holder's point of view has national platform ."
"(CNN) -- It's happening again. Moments after the jury in the ""loud music trial"" returned with its verdict against Michael Dunn -- guilty on three counts of attempted murder and a mistrial on charges of murdering teenager Jordan Davis -- a rash of commentaries began popping up. Writers are now expressing the kind of trepidation and angst that would have us believe that black children are not safe because a white man is lurking around every corner, waiting to shoot down a young man minding his own business. One of the first to weigh in was The Atlantic's Ta-Nehisi Coates, who equated Davis' murder to the selling away of slave children, a daily occurrence in the antebellum South. ""Jordan Davis had a mother and a father. It did not save him,"" Coates wrote. ""Trayvon Martin had a mother and a father. They could not save him. My son has a father and mother. We cannot protect him from our country, which is our aegis and our assailant. We cannot protect our children because racism in America is not merely a belief system but a heritage, and the inability of black parents to protect their children is an ancient tradition."" O'Mara: It's not about 'stand your ground' Does Coates really believe this? More important, does he want his son to internalize this, like one child in a photo taken outside the Duval County Courthouse, holding over his face a sign reading ""I Could Be Next"" with checked boxes next to the words ""loud music,"" ""Skittles"" and ""hoodies."" I'm not sure if these public voices reflect or inspire the outrage, sadness and fear resounding among black people on social media and article comments. What I do know is that African-Americans' fear that black boys are being hunted down at every turn by white men is just as toxic as the fear white people have of the black boogeyman. Such histrionics create an irrational, unproductive fear for those mainly interested in driving up news ratings, tilting elections and increasing donations to special interest groups. Indeed, John Roman, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute's Justice Policy Center, found (PDF) that of the 53,019 homicides from 2005 through 2010, white-on-black homicides accounted for only 3.9%, while black-on-white homicides were 8.77%. White-on-white and black-on-black homicides accounted for 44.14% and 43.18%, respectively. Still, this narrative has been in high drive since the public first learned how Trayvon Martin was killed by neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman. In the two years since, black parents have added ""beware white gunman"" to the long list warnings they issue to their black sons. ""The talk"" dates to 1863, according to The Boston Globe's James H. Burnett III. That year, the Emancipation Proclamation freed slaves who then had to figure out how to navigate a world of Southern whites still seething over the Civil War. Unlike the hyperbole of today, freedman warnings really were a matter of life and death. In ""A Festival of Violence: An Analysis of Southern Lynchings, 1882-1930,"" Stewart E. Tolnay and E.M. Beck documented 2,805 victims of lynch mobs killed in 10 Southern states. ""The scale of this carnage means that, on the average, a black man, woman, or child was murdered nearly once a week, every week, between 1882 and 1930 by a hate-driven white mob,"" their report says. After Dunn mistrial, misgivings about Florida law . From this most deadly period, the survival conversation evolved to meet the challenges of Jim Crow, the civil rights movement, the war on drugs and police profiling. Much of modern-day talk centers on the reality that store clerks, police and people generally do view black men with suspicion, says analyst Corey Dade. But the headline of his NPR essay ""Florida Teen's Killing: A Parent's Greatest Fear"" is overwrought. So too was Jeannine Amber's piece in Time magazine after Zimmerman's acquittal. ""We may never know exactly what happened the night Zimmerman shot Martin, but black parents know this: A neighborhood-watch man saw a brown-skinned teenager -- a boy who could have been one of ours -- wearing a hoodie pulled up against the rain and assumed he was up to no good,"" Amber wrote. ""That suspicion set into motion a chain of events that left the boy dead. How do we protect against that?"" We can't. What happened to Davis and Martin were freak incidents, not unlike a plane crash, rare disease or natural disaster. Starting the discussion with a presumption that such an event is a probability carries its own dangers. It presupposes white people -- men in particular -- have a pathology as great as the one put on black men: that they are violent beasts. We can't justify feeling imperiled by the idea that white men are gunning us down while rejecting sweeping generalizations regarding black men, some of whom are responsible for many of the murders in urban cities. These fears only work to further polarize our communities when we need to work together to alleviate the mistrust we have of one another. Instead, we must begin to peel away centuries of the conscious and subconscious uneasiness that allows white jurors to believe that a skinny kid can make a grown man fear for his life. Black parents have long balanced cautioning kids without having those concerns become full-blown paranoia. I fear we are losing this balance. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Yolanda Young.","Yolanda Young argues that reaction to the Michael Dunn verdict inaccurately blames race .

"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (CNN) -- After a month of searching, investigators now have their ""most promising"" lead yet in finding Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. A pinger locator in the Indian Ocean has detected signals consistent with those emitted by aircraft black boxes, the head of the Joint Agency Coordination Center said Monday. The sounds were heard at a depth of 4,500 meters (about 14,764 feet), retired Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston said. ""We've got a visual indication on a screen, and we've also got an audible signal. And the audible signal sounds to me just like an emergency locator beacon,"" Houston said. But it could take days before officials can confirm whether the signals did indeed come from the plane, which went missing March 8 with 239 people on board. ""Nothing happens fast,"" Houston said. ""We have a promising lead, but we have yet to get confirming evidence."" The search official said Monday he was much more optimistic in finding the plane than he was a week ago. Still, Houston said, ""I would like us to find some wreckage."" Along with the hints that searchers may be getting close to the plane, a fresh mystery surfaced. The aircraft skirted Indonesian airspace as it went off the grid and veered off course, a senior Malaysian government source told CNN Sunday. The new analysis of the flight's path means the plane may have been taken along a route designed to avoid radar detection, the source said. But why would someone steer the plane that way, and where is it now? Those are key questions that investigators are trying to answer -- and fast. The HMS Echo, a British navy ship equipped with advanced detection gear, sailed into the area of the southern Indian Ocean on Monday morning (Sunday afternoon ET) where a Chinese crew had detected two audio signals. And an Australian navy vessel carrying sophisticated U.S. listening technology is investigating a sound it picked up in a different patch of the ocean. Investigators hope the signals could be locator beacons from the plane's data recorders, but they're not sure yet. Time could be running out. It might be only a few hours or a few days before the pingers aboard the plane stop transmitting for good. The batteries inside the beacons, which are designed to start sending signals when a plane crashes into water, last about 30 days after the devices are activated. That 30th day has come -- though experts have said it's possible that they could last several days longer if they were at their full strength. Plane said to have flown around Indonesia . As searchers tried to find the aircraft, investigators pieced together new details about the plane's path. After reviewing radar track data from neighboring countries, officials have concluded that the passenger jet curved north of Indonesia before turning south toward the southern Indian Ocean, a senior Malaysian government source told CNN on Sunday. Whoever was flying the plane, the source said, could have been trying to avoid radar detection. But why? Like most details in the case that's baffled investigators ever since the plane dropped off Malaysian military radar, it depends on whom you ask. CNN law enforcement analyst Tom Fuentes cautioned against assuming a nefarious reason for steering the plane around Indonesia's airspace. ""I think the plane's being intentionally flown there, but I think it's still a mystery as to why. ... I think they would probably guess they're not avoiding anybody's radar, because there's a lot of radar in the area,"" he said. ""I think they're avoiding getting shot down or colliding with another airplane."" CNN aviation analyst Miles O'Brien said the new route includes designated waypoints that pilots and air traffic controllers use. ""This particular route that is laid out happens to coincide with some of these named intersections,"" he said. ""So what it shows is an experienced pilot somewhere in the mix on this."" Investigators haven't yet said who they think might have flown the plane off course or why. The possibility that the plane was hijacked by someone who knew how to fly a commercial jet is still on the table. Authorities have also been investigating the plane's captain and co-pilot. And they haven't ruled out mechanical problems as a possible cause of the plane's diversion. So far, no physical evidence of the plane's eventual whereabouts has been found, leaving many relatives of those on board trapped in uncertainty. Time is running out . The arrival of the Echo will be critical to the search for the missing Boeing 777. It has state-of-the-art sonar and is capable of mapping the ocean floor, which is about 4,500 meters (2.8 miles) deep in the focused search area. It should be able to help determine more confidently whether audio signals picked up on Friday and Saturday by the Chinese patrol ship Haixun 01 have any connection to the pingers from MH370. But officials urged caution. In the lengthy search for the missing plane, promising discoveries nearly every day have fizzled out, with few facts to support them. ""This is an important and encouraging lead, but one that I urge you to continue to treat carefully,"" Angus Houston, the head of the Australian agency coordinating search operations, said Sunday. The Chinese said the electronic pulses -- detected only 2 kilometers (1.25 miles) apart -- were consistent with those emitted by pingers on an aircraft's black boxes, but search officials said they haven't been verified as coming from Flight 370. Sounds travel long distances underwater, Houston said, making it difficult to ascertain their sources. If detectors were near a pinger, they would pick up the signal for a more sustained period. Houston also said that search authorities were informed Sunday that the Ocean Shield, an Australian naval vessel equipped with sophisticated listening equipment, has detected ""an acoustic noise"" in another area of the ocean to the north. The signals are the latest leads in a huge, multinational hunt for Flight 370, which disappeared almost a month ago over Southeast Asia. 'Most promising lead' The Ocean Shield, which has a high-tech pinger locator borrowed from the U.S. Navy, will continue to pursue the sound it heard. If that lead turns cold, it will move to the other detection area, a journey that will take at least a day, officials said. On Monday morning, the Ocean Shield was ""continuing investigations in its own area,"" Australian authorities said. ""At the moment, the most promising lead appears to be the one associated with Haixun 01,"" Houston said at a news conference in Perth, the Western Australian city serving as a hub for search operations. The pulses registered by the Chinese ship are of particular interest because they occurred in an area that fits with the latest calculation by experts of roughly where the plane is likely to have entered the water, Houston said. The area of detection is roughly 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) west-northwest of Perth, according to coordinates reported by Chinese state media. Caution urged . Several analysts on CNN said the information from search officials gave cause for optimism. ""We've got to be a little careful about groupthink here, but right now the evidence seems to point towards the Chinese vessel's location,"" said Alan Diehl, a former accident investigator for the U.S. Air Force. What's more, white objects were spotted floating on the surface of the water about 90 kilometers (55 miles) from where the sounds were detected, authorities said. But Houston warned that the latest discoveries could turn out to have no connection to the missing plane. ""In the days, weeks and possibly months ahead, there may be leads such as the one I'm reporting to you this morning on a regular basis,"" Houston said. ""I assure that we will follow up and exhaust every credible lead that we receive,"" he said. The Chinese vessel detected the second signal for a total of 90 seconds on Saturday, according to authorities. ""It's not a continuous transmission,"" Houston said. ""If you get close to the device, we should be receiving it for a longer period of time."" A former longtime Navy oceanographer said the Chinese equipment shown on TV didn't appear to be very sophisticated. Van Gurley told CNN that the gear was designed to be held by human divers and only had short-range capabilities. ""The fact that they're deploying it right over the side near the ocean surface, they're getting hits a mile apart, kind of doesn't add up -- but it does require investigation,"" said Gurley, now a senior manager at a consulting firm that uses complex mathematical methods to solve problems like finding a missing plane. Australian authorities are still working on understanding the technology used regarding the data generated by the Haixun 01 as it searches for the missing plane, a source with the Australian Defense Force told CNN. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet and Steve Almasy reported and wrote from Atlanta, and journalist Ivy Sam reported from Kuala Lumpur. CNN's Jethro Mullen, Holly Yan Ralph Ellis and Ben Brumfield contributed to this report.","NEW: Official: ""We have a promising lead, but we have yet to get confirming evidence""

"(CNN) -- The Mississippi NAACP has called on Governor Haley Barbour to publicly denounce an attempt by a Confederacy group to honor a Ku Klux Klan leader, the organization said Monday. The Sons of Confederate Veterans has launched the campaign to recognize Confederate Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest on a specialty license plate. Forrest, a popular and controversial figure, is best known as a leader of the KKK, the white supremacist group known for terrorizing blacks in the South after the Civil War. He is also praised and criticized for an 1864 raid at Fort Pillow, Tennessee, where hundreds of black Union Army members were killed during the war. The controversy over whether Forrest conducted or condoned the massacre is still a matter for heated debate. Mississippi NAACP leaders feel a state-sanctioned license plate honoring a man with ties to the KKK sends the wrong message to people in the state and across the country. ""Any individual who was a traitor to our country and our Constitution should be treated as such,"" said Derrick Johnson, president of the state NAACP chapter. Forrest was a ""terrorist"" whose acts were ""immoral and unconstitutional,"" Johnson said. Honoring him or anyone who promoted racial hatred or violence would be offensive, he said. The NAACP isn't alone in its protest against the SCV. More than 1,700 Mississippians have joined a Facebook group called Mississippians Against The Commemoration Of Grand Wizard Nathan Forrest. The group's website says they ""are united in sending a message to the state government of Mississippi that WE WILL NOT STAND for the public glorification of one of the original leaders of the Ku Klux Klan."" The proposal by the Sons of Confederate Veterans seeks to honor Confederate generals. ""If we can't hold him up to where he's supposed to be, then nobody else is gonna do it,"" group member Greg Stewart said. Forrest is being ""unfairly maligned,"" he told CNN. Most historians agree that Forrest left the KKK after less than two years because the small pockets of groups were growing rapidly, were unorganized and violent. Forrest felt ""they had the right idea, but went about it the wrong way,"" said Mike Martinez, a part-time political science instructor at Kennesaw State University. Despite his short stint with the Klan, Martinez said Forrest's affiliation with the organization gave it credibility. Stewart said Forrest was chosen to be recognized not because of his time with the KKK, but for his spirit and leadership during the Civil War. His image is one in a series of five that will have to be approved on a year-by-year basis by the state legislature, Stewart said. Other Confederacy symbols to be used on license plates are Beauvoir, the Jefferson Davis Home and Presidential Library, the battle for Vicksburg, the battle of Shiloh and Confederate soldiers. One image still under consideration that may surprise many people is that Holt Collier, an African American who fought for the Confederacy and eventually served under President Theodore Roosevelt as a bear tracker. Collier is best known for the famous Mississippi hunt where Roosevelt refused to shoot a wounded bear. It became known as the ""Teddy Bear"" craze. The SCV group has had a specialty license plate since 2003. The image of a small Confederate flag was used until last year when it was redesigned. Money from the sale of the plates is used to repair state-owned historical flags. Barbour has not responded to the controversy since it began making headlines last week. He spoke this weekend at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington, D.C., and is said to be setting his sights on a run for the White House in 2012. He finished 15th in a CPAC straw poll. A call to the governor's office from CNN on Monday has not been returned.","Confederacy group launches campaign to honor Ku Klux Klan leader .

"(CNN) -- The National Hockey League and a sports-oriented anti-homophobia advocacy group announced Thursday they are joining forces to provide players with tolerance training and other programs. The league said the agreement with You Can Play cements pro hockey's reputation as the world's most inclusive sports league. The New York-based league will partner with You Can Play to provide formal anti-homophobia training for all incoming players. The team and the players' union will also work to build You Can Play's programs into the league's behavioral health program to give players a confidential outlet to discuss issues of sexual orientation, according to a statement issued by the You Can Play and the league . It also calls for a ""significant commitment"" to training for teams, players and the public through formal training programs and outreach efforts -- including public service announcements featuring NHL players. ""As NHL players, we all strive to contribute towards helping our teams achieve success on the ice. Any player who can help in those efforts should be welcomed as a teammate,"" the statement quoted Ron Hainsey, a Winnipeg Jets defenseman and member of the NHL Players Association board, as saying. Opinion: An openly gay player is not a distraction . ""This partnership solidifies the message that the hockey community believes in fairness and equality for everyone,"" he said. The move doesn't affect the NHL's policy on discrimination based on sexual orientation, which has been part of its contract with players since 2005. Commissioner Gary Bettman said the agreement makes the NHL's policy of inclusiveness ""clear and unequivocal."" ""While we believe that our actions in the past have shown our support for the LGBT community, we are delighted to reaffirm through this joint venture with the NHL Players' Association that the official policy of the NHL is one of inclusion on the ice, in our locker rooms and in the stands,"" Bettman said in the joint statement with You Can Play. Other leagues also have promoted tolerance. The NBA's contract with players says the league can't discriminate against gay players, and new players receive tolerance training. The league has partnered with the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network and the Ad Council on an ad campaign addressing homophobic language and has worked with the gay rights advocacy group GLAAD on initiatives to address anti-gay bullying and other issues. In its 2011 contract with players, the NFL also banned discrimination based on sexual orientation. But the league ran into criticism from New York's attorney general, among others, in February after NFL prospects said that they had been asked questions about their sexual orientation. In March, Major League Soccer also unveiled an initiative urging players to reject all forms of discrimination. You Can Play was co-founded in 2012 by Philadelphia Flyers scout Patrick Burke, the son of hockey executive Brian Burke. Patrick Burke's brother, Brendan, announced he was gay in 2009. He died in a car crash the next year. New York pushes NFL on discrimination due to sexual preference .

"(OPRAH.com) -- For any mom who's ever felt frazzled, overwhelmed or rushed, Oprah says this show is for you. ""It's your wake-up call to slow down,"" she says. ""What happened to my guest today could so easily happen to any of you."" Brenda Slaby still blames herself for her daughter's death. She tells moms to slow down and appreciate their kids. Brenda Slaby says she was once an assistant principal and mother of two who tried her best to be ""supermom."" ""It was very hard trying to be the perfect mom and the perfect employee,"" she says. ""I try to be everything to everybody... I've always been the kind of person that lived for doing things for other people."" Then, on a hot August afternoon in 2007, she says she went from being a good role model for children, a good administrator and a good parent to being the most hated mom in America. When Brenda woke up on August 23, 2007, she says she knew she had a busy day ahead of her. Summer vacation was coming to a close, and it was the first day back for teachers at her school. That morning, the rush to get out the door was more frantic than usual, she says. Brenda and her husband, Gary, got their two young daughters, Allison and Cecilia, dressed and ready to go. Then, in a departure from their regular routine, Brenda loaded 2-year-old Cecilia into her car to take her to the babysitter's house. ""I had a dentist appointment, and I asked Brenda to take Cecilia,"" Gary says. ""I normally took both Cecilia and Allison, dropped Cecilia off at the sitter and Allison off at preschool."" With Cecilia sleeping in the backseat, Brenda pulled out of the driveway at about 6 a.m. When she realized it was too early to drop her youngest child off, she decided to run a quick errand. Brenda stopped at the store to buy doughnuts, a treat for the returning teachers. After loading her car with snacks, she got on the road that led to her school and drove straight there. With her mind racing through all the things she needed to accomplish before teachers arrived, Brenda got right to work. ""I had lots of things to set up,"" she says. ""I was nervous and frantic that morning because it was such an important day to get the school year [off] to a great start."" The day began with a staff meeting, followed by lunch. While chatting with new teachers between meetings, Brenda says she talked about her daughters. ""My feeling was it was a great first start,"" she says. ""It was going to be a great school year, and it was a great start to the day."" At about 4 p.m., Brenda was in her office, getting ready to head home when all hell broke loose. ""A good teacher friend of mine -- sometimes I think it was a blessing it was her -- was on her way home, and she walked by my car,"" Brenda says. ""She ran into my office and she said, 'Brenda, your baby's in the car.'"" Brenda immediately grabbed her keys and raced to the parking lot. ""I knew what I was going to find,"" she says. ""I opened my car door, and I remember hearing the voices around me. Teachers who were close to me [were] screaming."" When she got to her car she found Cecilia in the backseat, still strapped into her car seat. Brenda says she grabbed her daughter out of the car as fast as she could, but she knew it was too late. ""I knew she was gone as soon as I picked her up, I knew,"" she says. ""I remember I took her, and I ran through the parking lot with her, screaming her name. Then, what brought me kind of to consciousness, I guess, was somebody from the cafeteria yelled for me to bring her here."" Brenda says she handed her lifeless daughter to someone who tried to revive her. Then, she retreated to another part of the cafeteria and began to pray. ""I heard people yelling for ice, and I sat in a ball and I prayed,"" she says. ""I prayed harder than I've ever prayed in my life... But I knew she was gone."" Cecilia died of a heatstroke after being left in the car for nearly eight hours. Outside, temperatures had reached 100 degrees. Gary was working when he received a frantic call from Brenda's principal. ""He said, 'Get over to the school right now,'"" Gary says. ""And I said, 'What's up?' [He said,] 'It's an emergency.'"" In the car on the way to his wife's school, Gary says he never considered that his child's life might be in danger. ""The whole time I'm thinking, 'What disgruntled employee did something crazy?'"" he says. ""I said, 'Well, maybe something happened to Brenda.'"" When Gary pulled into the school parking lot, he says he saw a lot of commotion. Brenda's principal pulled him off to the side to tell him what happened. ""He looked at me and he says, 'Cecilia's dead,'"" Gary says. ""I didn't even think to ask him, 'How? Why?' I just got up and sort of walked off to be by myself. I was just in shock. I didn't know what to do."" Despite his grief, Gary says he has never blamed his wife for Cecilia's death. ""I could have done the same thing very easily,"" he says. On nights when his wife had to work late, Gary says she'd ask him to pick up the girls from the babysitter's house, a break from their normal routine. A few times, he says he forgot.

""I realized the most important person in the world to me lost out because I didn't plan well enough,"" she says. ""She's the one that slipped through the cracks."" The day Cecilia died, Brenda was taken to a police station where she was questioned for more than two hours. During her emotional confession, she says police officers were empathetic. ""Never during the questioning did they seem accusatory,"" Brenda says. One officer assured Brenda that no one thought she meant to hurt Cecilia. Brenda, on the other hand, was not easy on herself. ""Good mothers don't do this,"" she said during the questioning. ""How could I not think of my daughter? I want to die. I just want to die."" Brenda admits she had left Cecilia in a running car before, but she says she never made a habit of it. ""The day that Cecilia died was so different because I completely forgot that she was there,"" she says. While the police may have been empathetic, Brenda says her community was not. ""My community was in outrage,"" she says. ""I was the most hated mom.""

"(CNN) -- The F1 title race may have taken a potentially decisive twist Sunday as Lewis Hamilton took ruthless advantage of the misfortune which befell Mercedes teammate and bitter rival Nico Rosberg to win under the Singapore floodlights and leapfrog him in the standings. Rosberg, who led by a commanding 22 points coming into the 14th round of the championship, was left stranded in the pit lane after failing to move off his second spot on the grid for the formation lap and later retired as the electrical malfunction could not be remedied. Hamilton, who has won two straight races after claiming the Italian Grand Prix earlier this month, has taken a three-point advantage over Rosberg, with five races remaining. He was made to work for his victory by four-time reigning champion Sebastian Vettel, who took the lead after Hamilton pitted for fresh tires in the closing stages, but could not hold off the charging Briton, who eventually won by over 13 seconds. It was his seventh win of the season with Vettel and his Red Bull teammate Daniel Ricciardo completing the podium. Ferrari's Fernando Alonso and his former teammate Felipe Massa, now with Williams, claimed fourth and fifth. Frenchman Jean-Eric Vergne, who is set to be replaced at Toro Rosso by 16-year-old Dutchman Max Verstappen next year, finished sixth, holding off a fast-finishing Mexican Sergio Perez of Force India. Kimi Raikkonen in the second Ferrari, Nico Hulkenberg for Force India and McLaren's Kevin Magnussen completed the points scoring on the Marina Bay street circuit. Hamilton, who has taken over in the title lead for the first time since May, was delighted by the reversal of fortunes on claiming his 29th career F1 win. ""Things have changed for me absolutely. I looked for a clean weekend and this was it. We always strive to get both cars 1-2 that was our goal, so things still to work on,"" he said during the podium presentations. Rosberg also acknowledged that despite the dominance of Mercedes they still had work to do, with the German the victim of misfortune this time. ""Sitting on the grid, seeing everybody go by was a horrible feeling,"" he admitted. ""Reliability has again proven a weakness, which is something we must improve on."" They will head to the 15th round at Suzuka, Japan in a fortnight with the momentum now with Hamilton, who is looking to add to his 2008 championship triumph with McLaren.

"(CNN) -- A California educator who authorities say is the person accused in a YouTube video of sexual abuse by a former student was charged Monday with 16 felony counts of child sex abuse, the Riverside County District Attorney's Office said. Andrea Michelle Cardosa was charged with five counts of aggravated sexual assault on a child and 11 counts of lewd acts on a child, the DA's office said. Cardosa was arrested Monday evening by sheriff's deputies and is expected to be arraigned Thursday. She faces possible life in prison if convicted of the aggravated sexual assault charges. Cardosa's lawyer, Randy Collins, said in a written statement that in the face of ""very public claims of abuse,"" it would be his task ""to see that justice prevails in the midst of the media wildfire."" He added, ""Fortunately, our justice system requires more than a YouTube video to determine the facts of a case. As we proceed, I am certain that evidence will shed new light on all charges filed by the D.A.'s office against my client."" Collins said Cardosa was grateful for the ""outpouring of support from her family, friends, colleagues, and students during this difficult time."" Earlier, he said Cardosa's legal team planned to challenge the filing against the statute of limitations and challenge the bail motion to reduce the amount from $5 million. But John Hall, a spokesman for the district attorney's office, said there is no statute of limitations on the most serious charge -- aggravated sexual assault on a child under 14. Two women have come forward in connection with the case. The first woman, now 28, posted a YouTube video in which she accused the educator of abusing her at age 12. The second alleged victim, now 18, has filed a complaint accusing the Val Verde Unified School District in Perris, California, of negligence. David Ring, lawyer for the older woman, said, ""She is very gratified that the DA has brought charges against this perpetrator. She hopes justice is done in the criminal case and that Cardosa admits to what she's done, which she already admitted to in the phone call -- that she ruined her childhood."" Cardosa resigned January 17 from her most recent job as an administrator at Alhambra High School in Southern California after the first accusation was uploaded on YouTube, according to the school district. The video features the alleged victim on camera and what is said to be the teacher's voice on a phone conversation. In the video, the teacher can be heard acknowledging the abuse claim. The first alleged victim said the abuse took place ""off and on"" for her between the ages of 12 and 18. She said she didn't come forward as a teenager because the teacher had brainwashed her. ""She told me that my family didn't love me. She told me that nobody cared about me and that she was the only one that loved me and the only one that was there for me,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- There's a reason they call Kimi Raikkonen the 'Iceman' so it's no surprise the Ferrari driver isn't allowing rumors surrounding his retirement to get him hot and bothered. Raikkonen's future has been the subject of much speculation with talk of him leaving the sport sweeping through the paddock over the past few weeks. But the 34-year-old Finn, who sits 10th in the drivers' championship, says he is only concentrating on finishing his career with Ferrari. ""I'm not a young guy anymore so obviously I want to do something more in my life than just Formula One,"" Raikkonen, who is set to become a father early next year, told CNN's The Circuit. ""But I have no plans, I will finish my career at Ferrari, we'll see in the future."" Ferrari is enduring a difficult time with the team having failed to win a drivers' title since Raikkonen triumphed in 2007, while it currently trails Mercedes by 292 points in the constructors' championship. On Wednesday the Scuderia announced changes to its management structure, with Luca di Montezemolo, the man who presided over two decades of great success since taking up the role of chairman in 1991, to step down on October 13. Two years after becoming world champion, Raikkonen quit the sport after being pushed out of the team following Fernando Alonso's arrival. He spent two years trying his hand at rallying before returning to the sport with Lotus in 2011. It was during the British Grand Prix at Silverstone in July that rumors of Raikkonen's impending retirement began to surface. But Raikkonen, who began his F1 career with Sauber in 2001, says suggestions he is planning to leave the sport before his deal expires in 2015 are wide of the mark. ""No I never said that,"" responded Raikkonen after being asked if he had said he was ready to quit the sport. ""The only thing that I said was that I will finish my career in Ferrari, F1 career in Ferrari, then people came up with 'it's end of this year, it's now, it's then'. ""With newspapers they just try to make rumors, wanting to be the guy that writes something up, it's just rumors.""","Kimi Raikkonen to finish F1 career with Ferrari .

"Oslo, Norway (CNN) -- Norway paid tribute Friday to those killed and wounded in two terror attacks a week ago with a somber memorial service in Oslo organized by the youth movement of the ruling Labour Party. As the service began, Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg recalled the scores of young people lost to a ""cold-blooded massacre."" Police raised the death toll from 76 to 77 Friday after one of the wounded died. The shooter targeted the party's youth camp on Utoya Island, where it was holding a summer camp, after setting off a bomb that struck government offices in downtown Oslo. ""The shots hit our young people but they actually hurt the whole nation,"" Stoltenberg told relatives of the victims and political leaders attending the service. ""It was a vicious attack on all our common values."" The prime minister urged young Norwegians not to feel alone as they struggled to come to terms with what happened, saying the party would support them. ""Out of our grief a much stronger unity will arise,"" he said. ""We are going to honor and celebrate our heroes -- but most of all we are going stay true to our ideas and our values."" Workers Youth League leader Eskil Pedersen, who was on Utoya during the shootings, vowed that the youth movement would return to the island where it has held political summer camps every year for decades. ""Today, we promise that July 22 next year we will be back at Utoya,"" he said. ""We will forever be the generation of July 22. That is a great responsibility,"" he added. ""This is a watershed, a new start and beginning of something lasting and important."" The first funerals for victims of the attacks took place Friday, for Bano Rashid, 18, and Ismail Haji Ahmed, 19. Rashid, who was laid to rest in a Christian and Muslim ceremony, was reported to be a Kurd who came to Norway with her family in 1996 after fleeing Iraq. Flags on government buildings were flown Friday at half-staff. Meanwhile, Anders Behring Breivik, the suspect, was interrogated for a second time Friday, police said. Investigators had interviewed him a day after the attacks, but had more questions, police attorney Pal-Frederick Hjort Kraby said. Breivik is being kept in solitary confinement at Ila Prison, near Oslo, which held prisoners of the Nazis during World War II. His sole contacts are with his lawyer and prison staffers who take food to him, Kraby said. Breivik has admitted carrying out the bombing in Oslo, in which eight people died, and the shootings on Utoya, his lawyer and a judge have said. He has also pleaded not guilty. Police said Thursday that the search in the water around the island was ongoing. More than 50 investigators remained on the island and will likely be there for several more weeks, officials said. On Friday, authorities completed the identification of the dead, releasing the names of all 77. Their ages ranged from 14 to 61 with an average age of 21.

"Beijing (CNN) -- Conjoined twin girls -- each with a fully developed skull, but sharing one body -- have been born in China, according to their father, who said the babies are suffering from a host of health problems. ""The doctor said they are in critical condition,"" father Liao Guojun told CNN by telephone, as his babies cried in the background in a hospital intensive care unit. ""The girls suffer from more than 10 illnesses right now and their chance for survival is very low."" But he said the girls -- affectionately dubbed ""Left sister"" and ""Right sister"" by their parents -- bring the new mother and father much joy. ""They cry at the same time, they sleep at the same time and they wake up together, and sometimes their hands wiggle in the air, grabbing for each other's hand,"" Liao said. ""It's very cute."" The babies were born May 5 in China's southwest Sichuan province, in the small city of Suining. They share one trunk, one pelvis, one spleen, one gallbladder and one reproductive system. Initial X-rays show they have two spines, two esophagi, two stomachs, two sets of lungs and two separate nervous systems. The babies have been moved from Suining to Xin Qiao Hospital in the city of Chongqing for further examination. The hospital has classified them as ""high risk,"" as they suffer from conditions including anemia, pneumonia, jaundice and neonatal sepsis. Liao said doctors have said they cannot rule out epilepsy or cerebral palsy. China's state-run Xinhua news agency reported Wednesday that the babies' combined weight is about 4 kilograms (8 pounds). Xin Qiao Hospital has successfully separated four pairs of conjoined twins, according to Xinhua. However, doctors said the twins may not need immediate separation surgery as long as they can grow in a healthy way, Xinhua reported. And Liao said doctors told him that a separation surgery would be impossible, since the babies share one-and-a-half hearts, and that the structure of their trunk is not conducive to a surgery that either child would survive. ""I am very worried,"" Liao said. His wife remains hospitalized in Suining as she recovers from the birth, he said, and calls constantly to hear her daughters and receive updates on their condition. Preliminary imaging results have showed the babies' two skulls are fully developed and have normal facial features, according to state-run media. The couple had had several health checks, beginning six months ago, and believed they were having one healthy child. At a final pregnancy examination three days before birth, doctors told the parents they were having ""one baby with two heads,"" Liao said. The parents did not know the sex of the babies. Scanning to determine the sex of a baby in China is illegal, a rule designed to prevent sex-selective abortions. Liao said the parents were shocked by the news but moved forward with the birth. Liao said he worked as a cook in Guangdong province before the babies were born, and his wife was a factory worker for a cotton clothing manufacturer before she returned to Suining. The cost of the babies' care far outpaces the couple's modest income, so hospitals and social service organizations in Suining have stepped in to help foot the bills. ""The hospitals have never asked us for money,"" Liao said. ""Medical experts from across China are flying in to help us."" He said he hopes the babies, along with his wife, will recover. ""The girls are different than the other children because they have two heads,"" he said. ""Their health conditions are poor. (But) we hope that since they were born to us, in this world, that they can live their lives as they were meant to do.""

"Istanbul (CNN) -- The European Union avoided a rupture of relations with Turkey by agreeing to open a new round of membership negotiations with the Turkish government. But the date for the next round of talks on the nation joining the EU will be determined only after publication of an annual progress report on Turkey. The decision was reached after several long rounds of talks last weekend between the foreign ministers of Germany and Turkey. Germany had threatened to block Turkish membership negotiations after more than three weeks of riots in Turkey during which riot police repeatedly attacked anti-government demonstrators with tear gas and pepper spray. The development comes amid daily tensions. Turkish police detained at least 20 people in Ankara on Tuesday. Turkey's semiofficial Anatolian Agency reported they were accused of being members of a terrorist organization, attacking police and destroying public property. Turkey's foreign minister welcomed Tuesday's decision by the EU. ""I hope we will not go through such a crisis again,"" Ahmet Davutoglu said in remarks to journalists in Ankara. ""The Turkey-EU train will move to reach its target in the quickest way."" ""Compromise (is a) good decision in difficult times,"" the German Embassy in Ankara said on Twitter, citing German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle. Turkey has been pursuing membership in the European Union for more than half a century. But while Turkey's top diplomat was embracing international rapprochement with Europe, the Turkish prime minister was delivering a speech warning of a shadowy foreign conspiracy aimed at toppling him from power. Speaking before members of his political party in the Turkish parliament, Recep Tayyip Erdogan repeated his claims that the protests against him were being organized by the same ""center"" that he alleged organized recent riots in Brazil. ""There are many similarities between what is going on in Brazil and here,"" he said. ""... The button that was pushed to activate the riots in both countries was pushed from the same center."" Erdogan vowed to prosecute hotels that sheltered protesters during clashes with police. He also criticized a female journalist from the British Broadcasting Corporation's Turkish service, who became the target of an online smear campaign by the mayor of Ankara last Sunday. Ibrahim Melih Gokcek, an elected mayor from Erdogan's Justice and Development Party, launched a hashtag campaign on Twitter accusing the BBC's Selin Girit of being a British spy. The BBC issued a statement on Monday expressing concern about what it described as Turkish government threats against a BBC employee. Monday night, U.S. president Barack Obama held a telephone call with Erdogan, a close Middle Eastern ally who received a warm reception during a visit to the White House last month. The two leaders discussed providing additional support to rebels battling the government in neighboring Syria. According to a White House statement, Erdogan and Obama also discussed ""the importance of nonviolence and of the rights to free expression and assembly and a free press."" Family of slain protester 'devastated' Meanwhile, the family of Ethem Sarisuluk, a protester who died in a hospital after being shot by a police officer earlier this month in Ankara, said they were ""devastated"" after a court released the suspected shooter on Monday. The court ruled the police officer shot Sarisuluk while firing in self-defense, Anatolian Agency reported. ""My family thought justice would be shown in this case, and now especially my mother is devastated,"" said Sarisuluk's brother, Mustafa, in a phone call with CNN. ""The government controls law and justice and blesses the murderous police department,"" he added. Amateur video of what is believed to be the shooting incident on June 1 shows a helmeted police officer nearly surrounded by stone-throwing protesters. In the video, which has gone viral across Turkish social networking sites, the police officer lunges forward, kicking a demonstrator while being pelted with stones. Immediately afterward, he pulls out his pistol and fire three rapid shots in the air, at which point Sarisuluk, one of the masked demonstrators involved in the clash, drops to the ground. According to Anatolian Agency, the court ruled that ""the suspect's action of firing into the air may fall within the limits of self-defense."" Sarisuluk, two other demonstrators and a police officer are among at least four people killed during the wave of anti-government protests over the past month. Earlier this month, the European Parliament adopted a resolution criticizing the Turkish government for ""the disproportionate and excessive use of force by Turkish police to break up peaceful and legitimate protests."" On Monday, several hundred demonstrators organized a protest march in Istanbul upon receiving news of the release of the suspected shooter of Sarisuluk. Protesters also organized a Twitter campaign repeating the message, ""My name is Ethem Sarisuluk. I was unarmed. Police shot me in the head and I died. They set my murderer free."" The unprecedented violence in Turkey began after riot police repeatedly attacked a group of demonstrators who were protesting against the demolition of a small park in Istanbul. Prime Minister Erdogan had announced plans to replace the park with a shopping mall. After police launched a predawn raid on the sit-in on May 31 using tear gas and water cannons, demonstrators began fighting back. The violence rapidly escalated and spread to other Turkish cities, as protesters began building barricades, hurling stones, and eventually throwing fireworks and gas bombs at police. The clashes blossomed into the largest civil disobedience movement Turkey has seen in a generation. Demonstrators have lashed out against what they describe as the increasingly dictatorial policies of Erdogan. Erdogan first swept to power after his party won national elections more than a decade ago.","The government's harsh reaction to protests has raised concerns among EU nations .

"(CNN) -- What makes a city ""cool""? If it means being loaded with atmosphere, charm, great food and nightlife, yet ignored by the bulk of travelers, then Lisbon deserves consideration as Europe's coolest capital. Here's why. 1. Nightlife that can outlast Madrid's . If you think Madrid stays out late, try a night out in Lisbon. The city is less about heaving clubs and more about a roving nocturnal flow that ends (maybe) when dawn rises over the Tagus River. The main action is in the Bairro Alto, where more than 250 appealing bars line a web of streets between graffiti-plastered walls. Next is the riverfront, in the hip neighborhood around Cais do Sodré railway station. Typical of the offbeat flavor here is the converted brothel Pensão Amor (Rua do Alecrim 19, +351 21 314 3399) where ace cocktails accompany erotica and DJ sets. Capping a Lisbon night are pre-dawn traffic jams at Santa Apolonia docks -- they're created by the popularity of Lux, the king of Lisbon superclubs (Cais da Pedra +351 21 882 0890). 2. Experimental cuisine . Once known largely for bacalhau (dried cod), quaint old coffee houses and louche taverns, the Portuguese capital now claims a range of restaurants. Seafood remains a staple, but the trend is for modern, sophisticated and affordable. A high bar is set by wunderkind chef José Avillez at his Michelin-starred Belcanto (Largo de Sao Carlos 10, +351 21 342 0607) or his more casual bistro Cantinho (Rua dos Duques de Bragança 7, +351 211 992369). Avant-garde European and Portuguese cuisine describes Avillez's menu, which stretches from sea bass with seaweed to lamb with vegetable puree. Further down the scale, Lisbonites love juicy bifanas (pork buns) in backstreet eateries. No traveler to Lisbon should miss the famed egg tarts (pasteis de nata). The little bundles of caramel-y custard in chewy pastry are eaten in style at the original tiled café, Antiga Confeitaria de Belem (Rua Belém 84-92, +351 21 363 7423). 3. Irony . You'd think Lisbonites would brag about their achievements -- first global empire, world's best custard tarts, sea bass with seaweed that actually tastes great. On the contrary, along with the rest of the nation, they excel in that ages old literary device/defense mechanism: irony. As Portuguese writer Fernando Pessoa once eloquently summed up the prevailing national outlook: ""I'd woken up early, and took a long time getting ready to exist."" That old entertaining melancholy has resurfaced with the austerity of recent years, helping Lisbonites remain (almost) content and always witty, even in tough times. 4. Beaches and castles . Lisbon is a place to inhale salty Atlantic air, sunbathe and hit the waves. Dolphins surf and ferries ply the River Tagus. Half an hour away by train are the beaches and ornate casino of Estoril. A bit further, Cascais is for eaters -- lots of grilled fish and seafood stews served in domed cataplana dishes. The other big day trip is to Sintra. Forty minutes from Lisbon's main station (Rossio), it's a time-warp town, located in lush, wooded hills peppered with whimsical palaces and mansions that epitomize centuries of aristocratic opulence. 5. Fabulous design . Wherever you look in Lisbon, sharp contemporary design is a hallmark. Stylish leather goods, bold wine labels, interiors combining vintage with the latest designer pieces, spectacular buildings -- this is a city that loves to look good. Pritzker-prize winning architect Alvaro Siza Vieira set the modernist tone with his gravity-defying pavilion for Expo 98. Lisbonites gather to appreciate good design at MUDE (Rua Augusta 24, +351 21 888 6117), their mutant fashion and design museum, where austere low-tech blends with baroque flounces. 6. Big art . Large European capitals such as London, Paris, Berlin and Madrid may have blockbuster art collections, but Lisbon's half million inhabitants have access to their own rare panoply. The classic is the Gulbenkian Foundation (Av. de Berna 45A, +351 21 782 3000), where superlative Oriental and Western art occupies an airy 1960s building and landscaped gardens. In Bélem, the Museu Berardo (Praça do Império, +351 21 361 2878) focuses on big names of 20th- and 21st-century art, from Picasso to Jeff Koons. Museu de Arte Antiga (Portuguese site only; Rua Janelas Verdes, +351 21 391 2800) is a 17th-century mansion packed with 500 years of artwork that reflects Portugal's globetrotting history. Lisbon's latest exclusive is the impressive Museu do Oriente (Avenida de Brasília, Doca de Alcântara, +351 21 358 5244), a superbly converted salt cod warehouse full of Asian exhibits where you can book a nighttime visit followed by dinner in the riverfront restaurant. 7. Fascinating streets . There's no getting bored wandering in Lisbon, thanks to the intricately patterned cobblestones under your feet -- a civic point of pride that blossomed after Lisbon's 1755 earthquake and continues today. Even Lisbon's walls demand attention, thanks to an obsession with azulejos (ceramic tiles). Top examples are found at the Museu Nacional do Azulejo (Rua da Madre de Deus 4, +351 218 100 340), while the peeling façades of the Alfama and Mouraria districts show dozens of variations.","Lisbon was the first global city -- it still feels like it .
Its inhabitants are experts at irony and creativity .
They challenge Madrileños for nightlife stamina .
They make the best custard tarts on the planet ."
"(CNN) -- The mother of passenger No. 63 aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 is unable to come out of the shadows of her son's misdeed to mourn with the rest of the families whose loved ones disappeared on March 8. ""As a human being, as a mother, nobody thought of me. I am alone with no support except for God,"" she wrote after CNN tried to contact her about her son. She is suffering alone because she has shied away from the epicenter of information in Kuala Lumpur. She isn't there to attend the briefings, or to get the grief counseling provided by Malaysia Airlines. She is a mother whose son broke the law to get on the plane, and she is now paying for it. Her son is 18-year-old Pouria Nourmohammadi. He and his friend Delavar Seyed Mohammad Reza, 29, were the two Iranian men who boarded the Malaysia Airlines flight using stolen passports, investigators say. They were two of the first people to come under suspicion in the plane's disappearance. Malaysia Airlines says it has not been in contact with the families. Their case is in the hands of investigators, a company representative told CNN. But investigators cleared them of any wrongdoing in connection with the disappearance of the plane early in the investigation. Nourmohammadi's mother is acutely aware that her son did something illegal, but she says he just wanted to explore his ""beautiful dreams."" ""I dedicated my life to my sons, and all I wanted was for them to be happy in their life. I wanted them to live a free life. I had prayed that I would see him again, but that didn't happen. We will see each other in eternity now."" Going on after sudden loss of a loved one . She pours out her grief with pictures of her son, messages to him and symbols of their Christian faith posted on her Facebook page. ""... From the moment I became a mother, all I wanted and asked from God was to not see my children die before me. But of course that didn't happen,"" she wrote. CNN met with a friend who dropped Nourmohammadi off at the airport on March 8 in Kuala Lumpur. The friend said that all Nourmohammadi wanted was to find ""freedom."" He boarded the plane with a plan to live in Germany with his mother and never return to Iran, his friend said. His friend did not want to be identified for fear that being associated with the men traveling on stolen passports would make him a target for harassment by authorities when he travels in and out of Iran. But he says Nourmohammadi's mother called him, looking for answers: . ""She was so sad. She was asking me, 'When my son was there, was he happy? He was enjoying?' ""And I said, 'Yeah, as I see. He was happy and he was enjoying. He was OK.' Then she just said, 'Thank God.' "" Interpol has rebutted Malaysia's explanation for not checking an international database of lost and stolen passports when passengers boarded Flight 370, an omission that may have allowed Nourmohammadi and Reza onto the plane. Malaysian Home Minister Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi told the Malay Mail Online last week that using Interpol's Stolen and Lost Travel Documents (SLTD) database might have slowed down the process of immigration checks at airport counters. He said the country's immigration equipment could not handle the global database of 40.2 million lost passports. Interpol fired back, saying the problem cannot be blamed on technology or the agency. ""Interpol's SLTD database takes just seconds to reveal whether a passport is listed, with recent tests providing results in 0.2 seconds,"" the international law enforcement agency said in a statement. ""The fact is that the U.S. consults this database more than 230 million times per year; the UK more than 140 million times; the UAE more than 100 million times and Singapore more than 29 million times. Not one of these countries, or indeed any INTERPOL member country, has ever stated that the response time is too slow."" Nourmohammadi's Facebook message four days before he got on the plane shows him standing below an iconic Malaysian skyscraper with the words, ""feeling excited."" He never made it to his final destination, just like the other passengers and crew of the missing Malaysia Airlines flight. Nourmohammadi's mother left this message, hoping it would not fall on deaf ears just because her son broke the law: . ""Although he had a stolen passport,"" his mother said, ""he was so young with many beautiful dreams. I'm a mother just like the Chinese mothers, and I want to know what happened too. I trust in God and whatever he wants will happen. But all 239 persons are the same, maybe somebody doesn't believe that."" 6 missteps in the investigation . Read the cockpit transcript .

"(CNN) -- There has been much speculation about whether the ads that President Barack Obama's campaign and its supporters have been running that are critical of Mitt Romney's tenure at Bain Capital will be effective. There is also lots of critiquing of the reasons and effectiveness of first lady Michelle Obama's appearances on talk shows and reality shows (""The Biggest Loser,"" ""Late Show With David Letterman,"" ""The Daily Show,"" etc.). But something I saw last night indicates the Bain ads are starting to have an effect, and that women view Michelle Obama as a positive -- a conduit to the president. I was invited to sit in remotely on two focus groups of so-called ""Wal-Mart"" moms in Richmond, Virginia, and Las Vegas. Both groups -- 23 women, in all -- were screened to ensure the moms were not strong partisans on either side, and most identified themselves as independents and undecided. The Las Vegas group was all Latinas. It was a fascinating exercise that confirmed just how tight the presidential campaign will be. But what struck me most was that while Mitt Romney is still largely an unknown with these women -- and as such still has room and opportunity to define himself -- many of them said they did not like what they had heard described from ads about his time as head of Bain Capital. They gave him kudos for being a businessman, saying that would be a good attribute for a president in creating jobs, but they also underscored what they had heard in the ads that had been running in their hometowns. They used phrases like ""I heard that while he was the head of a company, many workers lost their jobs ..."" ""That scares me."" When asked to use one word or phrase to describe Romney, the words or phrases they used included ""Don't know that much about him,"" ""selfish, ""businessman who is concerned with making himself some money,"" ""concerned about the wealthy,"" ""can't be trusted,"" ""scares me,"" and ""lackluster"" -- again, echoing some of what is being said in the Bain ads around the country. They did admire him for being a ""good family man,"" and some of the women appreciated his corporate success but others followed up with ""the country is more than a business ... a country has to take care of its people."" Sound familiar? Some also gave him credit for having passed a health care plan in Massachusetts, one he is now running away from on the campaign trail. Opinion: 'Anti-business' label could hurt Obama's chances . So while in the minds of many of these women, Mitt Romney is largely undefined, what they apparently do know and feel about him seems to echo those Bain ads -- and look to represent a beginning sketch of someone they cannot trust. To be clear, these women were not in the tank for Obama -- but that was the whole point for the exercise to begin with. Many have been disappointed with his ""lack of keeping his promises,"" and many said they haven't seen the change that he talked about so much in 2008. When asked to use a word or phrase to describe Obama, they used ""false promises,"" ""not a lot of change,"" ""big government."" But by and large, the women in both of these groups would then follow up with phrases or explanations that would seem to indicate they understood just how difficult a situation he was handed when he came into office. Many stated ""he can't do it in three years,"" or ""he has been productive but he is hitting walls,"" and ""he came into a big mess and has made some improvements."" It seemed very fertile ground for the Obama campaign to make the FDR argument also used by President George W. Bush 2004, the one about not changing horses midstream. Based on their words, these women were most concerned about the economy, jobs and housing. And again, words associated with Romney, such as ""concerned for the wealthy,"" seemed to indicate a disconnect with what families were struggling with. Interestingly, neither group had any idea what the ""gender gap"" was. But as they were led in a conversation about issues important to women -- which were inextricably linked to the economy and concern for the health and future of their children -- women in both groups volunteered that Michelle Obama was someone to further the interests of women and their families. The president ""listens to Michelle,"" they said. Some in the Latina mom group went further and said that Michelle Obama's interests are their interests because she is a woman and a minority. And because of this, the president would make sure their interests are represented. In their eyes, she was them. There is no doubt there are opportunities here for Romney to work on filling in the blanks, because there are many. But if the old adage is right, that in politics you need to define yourself before your opponent does, then the Romney campaign will need to more fully explain his time at Bain, including why he made millions even as he fired workers and closed companies, denying workers their health care and pensions. Because right now, what has the potential to sink in is an image of Mitt Romney as head of Bain Capital. That, at least with this small sliver of moms in key battleground states, is one that scares them. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Maria Cardona .","Maria Cardona says she observed two focus groups of women asked about candidates .
She says most still know little of Romney; many thought he put business before people .

"(CNN) -- Police have found evidence that ""strongly indicates"" a 12-year-old boy who was witnessed being snatched by a crocodile in a remote part of Australia was killed in the attack. ""No specifics will be given in relation to the trauma or type of evidence located out of respect for the family,"" acting police commander Michael White said in a statement Tuesday. The family of the boy -- who would have returned to school Tuesday after the summer break -- have been informed, a spokeswoman for the Northern Territory police, Rebecca Forrest, told CNN. ""As expected they're grieving,"" Forrest said. ""But the evidence is there that he's deceased."" As search crews continued to gather evidence Tuesday, shoot-to-kill orders remained in place for crocodiles longer than two meters around the small community where the attack occurred. Three animals have been killed so far, ranging from 2.5 to 4.7 meters in length, Forrest said. The boy had been swimming with four other children in a water hole near Mudginberri in the Northern Territory's Kakadu National Park on Sunday afternoon, when a saltwater crocodile attacked the group. One of the boys, aged 15, was bitten by the animal but managed to escape. The crocodile then turned on his friend, aged 12, said police sergeant Stephen Constable. ""The 15-year-old boy was grabbed on his right arm. He started fighting off the croc, and it took him by the left arm; then it let him go and took hold of the 12-year-old boy, and swam off with him."" Police officers and park rangers have been using helicopters and boats to search the area since the attack occurred. A crocodile expert who examined the first boy's wounds, believed the crocodile was between 2.5 to three meters long (around eight to nine feet), Constable said. Search crews have also been looking for larger crocodiles that may have attacked the one that took the 12-year-old. ""On occasion a smaller crocodile may take some food, and a bigger crocodile will take it off them,"" said Constable. According to local media reports, people had been warned against swimming in the area after a teenager survived an attack by a five-meter-long crocodile in the region in January last year. Constable said this time of year is particularly dangerous due to seasonal flooding. Australian boy says kangaroo saved him . Coroner rules dingo to blame for Australian baby's death .

"(CNN) -- Two years ago, a single conversation changed my life: My boss told me I needed to lose weight or kiss my job goodbye. Actually, she didn't say that at all -- but it's what I heard. In fact, she never used the words ""fat"" or ""lose weight."" She never threatened my career. But when she said my clothes didn't do me justice, and that she wanted to send me to a stylist, I took a different message away. I took it to mean that if I didn't physically reduce my size I would no longer appear on ABC's ""Good Morning America,"" where I have been a long-time contributor. TV is, after all, a visual medium, and everyone should look their best. So lose weight or lose your job is what I heard. I had been fat my entire life, trapped by it, but seemingly powerless to change. In retrospect, I was itching for an overwhelming reason -- short of a heart attack or Type II diabetes diagnosis -- to have to lose weight. The thought of losing a job I love was the spark I needed to get going. If you've spent your life as a fat person, when you desperately don't want to be, you know it's like being in prison: you want to escape, but despite many efforts, you fail to make a break from behind those bars. I was fed up with allowing the shame of my weight to control many poor decisions -- from wearing navy on my wedding day to avoid looking like a massive marshmallow in a traditional white dress, to skipping all routine medical care for more than 10 years because I didn't want a lecture about my size. When I set about losing weight, I really didn't know how I was going to actually do it. But I knew one thing for certain: I wasn't going to go on yet another diet. I had been there, done that. Actually, I had tried pretty much every diet out there from Atkins to The Zone, cabbage soup to the Cookie Diet. Sure, I'd lose some weight, but each and every time I'd tire of the regimen, revert to old habits and gain it all back again. I came to conclude that diets simply pause bad behavior, and this time merely pausing wasn't good enough. Instead, my plan was fairly simple: . Eat less: (duh), which I arbitrarily determined to be half what I used to eat. My little trick became if I could name everything I ate that day in under 10 seconds I was doing fine. Choose better: For me, that meant cutting carbohydrates, which meant saying goodbye to a lot of white foods -- anything with flour, pasta, rice, potatoes and sugar. No cheat days: While many diets prescribe a weekly day off for good behavior, I knew that didn't work for me. I'd wait until my cheat day arrived, eat every offender I could find, and before long I'd be back to eating with abandon full-time. I now think that rewarding anyone trying to lose weight with a cheat day is akin to telling an alcoholic he can celebrate a month of sobriety with a beer. It doesn't work. If I could handle moderation, I wouldn't have been fat in the first place. Move more: This was the easiest of all, since I wasn't moving at all. Taking the stairs, walking to and from work and strolling around the block a few times a day evolved into a daily walk on the treadmill next to my bed. Hold my self accountable, daily: I weighed myself every morning to always be aware of where I was. No more burying my head in denial. Pause before binging:  Mindless snacking had always done me in. This time before eating, I stopped to think: preference or priority? The preference may have been to go for the chips or cookies, but the priority was always to lose weight. Just reflecting on that for a moment allowed to make the right choice. Over the course of one year, using this simple plan, I lost 62 pounds. I've since lost another 10 pounds. I came to learn that what I put in my head is far more powerful than what I put in my mouth -- and I'm forever grateful to that boss who set me on this journey. When it comes to losing weight, no pill, potion or plan trumps patience and perseverance. That was the missing piece of the puzzle for me -- the steel bar that kept me from feeling the freedom to finally figure it out. In the past, I expected overnight results, and when I didn't get them, I stopped trying. I was successful professionally, with a loving husband and beautiful kids. But when it came to losing weight, I was a disaster, failing time and again because I lacked the right mindset. My message seems to be resonating with people who have fought long-time or life-time weight battles. I have gotten thousands of e-mails from people who say my story is their story -- that they, too, were lulled into complacency by one diet gimmick after another, only to lose a little and gain it all back. In this age of outsized Powerball wins, many of us think that all you need to do to get rich is buy a lottery ticket. Want to be the next Lady Gaga? A few appearances on ""American Idol"" will do the trick. We're always looking for the quick fix, the easy out, to solve what ails us. The past doesn't have to dictate the future. Each of us has the power to change our mind for a happier, healthier, better life. Anyone can make the shift.

"(CNN) -- Ohio State's former marching band director is speaking out for the first time since the university fired him over the band's overly sexual culture. Jonathan Waters was fired in July after a university investigation concluded he ""should have known about sexual harassment that created a hostile environment."" Waters told CNN affiliate WBNS on Tuesday that he was ""absolutely shocked by the one-sidedness of the report,"" and called his firing a ""rush to judgment."" He also said that despite the school's conclusion to the contrary, he was sanitizing the marching band's historically tawdry culture that he first experienced as a sousaphone player in the 1990s. ""That cultural change is also evident in the many, many letters from current and former band members, which attest to Jonathan's efforts and concrete success at moving the band's culture in a positive direction,"" his attorney, David Axelrod, said Tuesday. The investigation's report, released July 23, told of bawdy band member nicknames and risquÃ© traditions such as the ""midnight ramp,"" in which band members entered the stadium through a ramp wearing only their underwear. Axelrod said Waters knew about some of the band's bad behavior, but he said he did ""everything he possibly could to end it."" ""You know he experienced inappropriate behavior as a rookie band member himself. He was deeply affected by it and that's why as band director he did everything he could to stop anything inappropriate,"" he said. The attorney said Waters ""left the band with a far improved culture from the one that he inherited,"" and slammed the report that ousted him. ""Had (investigators) chosen to talk with a representative sample of students and alumni, rather than its hand-picked, isolated sample, its conclusions would have been far different,"" he said. The university responded Tuesday. ""The former director has yet to produce any factual examples that demonstrate any tangible attempts to change the band culture,"" said Gary Lewis, an Ohio State spokesman. ""In fact, the former director himself acknowledged that he knew of the nicknames both as a student member of the band and as its director."" But Waters said ""the university found no tangible evidence of cultural change because it conveniently chose not to look."" Ohio State also appointed two interim band leaders Tuesday.

"(CNN) -- For Heather Neroy, it used to be a tedious process: Whenever she came across an interesting arts-and-crafts project or recipe on the Internet, she would save it for later by copying the link, pasting it into an e-mail and sending it to herself. After that Neroy, a stay-at-home mom from Southern California, would file the e-mail in a folder for future reference. It wasn't exactly the most efficient system. Then last year, during one of her browsing sessions, she read a blog post that gushed about a new website called Pinterest. The virtual pinboard, where users can pin and organize images onto individual ""boards,"" didn't pique Neroy's interest at first, but she quickly changed her mind. ""Someone described it as an online filing system, and I thought, 'That's exactly what I need,' "" she said. Soon Neroy was pinning away and, like many Pinterest users, got quickly hooked. She first started with a Halloween board where she pinned costume ideas. Next, Neroy created a shared color board for redecorating her daughter's bedroom that she and her husband could add to. Pinterest also allows other users to follow each other's boards and ""re-pin"" another person's images. In no time Neroy was sharing other people's pins and following users with similar tastes. ""It's been really neat to see what other moms are pinning,"" she said. ""Some days you run out of ideas and you don't know what to do to fill the time before bedtime. I thought it was going to be just me organizing, but it's really a community sharing all these different ideas that I didn't even know existed."" Think of Pinterest as a way of cataloging your passions. Members have used the website to plan weddings and holidays. Others have pinned images of clothes, recipes, architecture, art, crafts, cars and even technology. Thanks to media reports and the devotion of users like Neroy, there's been a lot of buzz around Pinterest in recent months. In October, TechCrunch confirmed that Pinterest had received $27 million of funding from the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowtiz. The pinboard website has been covered and praised extensively by media like Time magazine, and Mashable, which called it ""addictive."" Pinterest co-founder Ben Silbermann declined to cite specifics about the invite-only site's growth. But Experian Hitwise, an Internet analytics firm, estimates that Pinterest received nearly 11 million total visits during the week ending December 17, 2011 -- almost 40 times the number of visits six months earlier. Silbermann said what's most exciting about his website is how it helps you find new influences for things that you like -- and in turn lets other people with shared interests provide feedback on your pins. ""The things that you collect say a lot about who you are,"" Silbermann told CNN. ""Our job at Pinterest is to help you discover people who have similar taste. It creates an online catalog where every item is handpicked just for you."" The appeal of content curation . Marshall Kirkpatrick, a senior writer at ReadWriteWeb, is not surprised by Pinterest's success. In an analysis of the website in September, he wrote that Pinterest's ""clean retro visual design"" and our fundamental need to collect and organize are part of its appeal. In an interview with CNN, Kirkpatrick added that collecting ""affirms our relationship with the world around us."" Pinterest offers an easy way to digitally curate content without the pain of cutting clippings or saving endless web pages on your desktop, he said. ""Content curation is a timeless problem that a lot of people have tried to solve,"" Kirkpatrick said. ""Pinterest brings a lot of high design to doing it and a lot of user experience. And with a larger group of people then there's a never-ending supply of content to enjoy."" Yet the concept of content curation is hardly new. FFFFound, vi.sualize.us, We Heart It, Image Spark and Tumblr are among the other websites that offer visual bookmarking with a few clicks and have been doing so for a while. But Elad Gil, director of corporate strategy at Twitter, pointed out in a blog post a few weeks ago that Pinterest takes this further by giving structure to ""push button content generation."" Here's what he means: Clicking Pinterest's ""Pin It"" button, which can be added to your browser's bookmarks toolbar, will automatically grab the picture you want from the website you are on. What is different is that it immediately adds it to any of your Pinterest boards, allowing you to categorize your content then and there. The boards each have a separate page and can be easily accessed, shared and viewed on a sort of mother board on your Pinterest profile. ""Importantly, it was easy for new users to consume these sets of content visually as structured sets, and to share these sets with others,"" Gil wrote. ""This next wave of social curation will fundamentally change how users find and interact with content over time."" Users: Defining 'your own aesthetic' Blogger Jonathan Lo, creative director of J3 Productions, a design and marketing agency, often pins using the Pinterest mobile app. He calls using the website ""instinctual."" Lo first started with home and graphic design pins related to his blog and then eventually created a board for his personal taste in fashion. ""It helps you define your own aesthetic,"" said Lo, who lives in Irvine, California. ""I noticed patterns and recurring themes, so I got a stronger sense of what style I have. I wouldn't have necessarily been able to see that earlier. It's nice to be able to put a sense of order to all the things you like."" Business owners also are flocking to the website to lead new audiences to their products. Jeanine Hays, the creative director and founder of AphroChic, an interior design company and blog, says she uses Pinterest to find inspiration for her business. As a designer, she uses Pinterest as a virtual mood board to develop concepts, and is often up till midnight just pinning. ""Pinterest is a great tool for designers looking for new and different content,"" said Hays, who lives in Philadelphia. ""And it is a way to get into the mind of the designer and the brand of the company. My readers can actually see what the next trend is going to look like."" Silbermann believes Pinterest is different from other social networks because users are using the website to catalog their day-to-day activities. ""I think it's really cool that people are pinning the most important projects in their lives."" he said. ""I think it's a service that can really make your offline life more interesting."" Neroy is one such user. She is determined to use Pinterest for more offline purposes. ""I want to spend more time doing than pinning, to encourage time with my kids so that mom's not just sitting at the computer,"" she said. In fact, Neroy went as far as to start a blog called Pinfluence to make sure of that. The blog chronicles her Pinterest exploits, in which she picks interesting do-it-yourself pins, tries them out for herself and writes about the results. At present, Neroy has blogged about more than 30 pins, from cleaning her ceiling fans with a pillowcase to an unsuccessful crock-pot lasagna recipe to dressing her daughters in her wedding dress, which has been her most popular post to date. ""I thought it would be interesting to other moms to see me putting my own spin on it and sharing my success and failures,"" she said. ""I want to show that if I could do it, they could do it as well."" Neroy added: ""What I tell my friends [is], they are not just pinning but creating. And that's really where they'll find the benefit from Pinterest.""","On Pinterest, users can organize images into individual ""boards""

"(CNN) -- ""Even if I could physically do it ... I wouldn't want to go onto another Games because this has been as good as it can get at an Olympics,"" says Chris Hoy, Britain's champion cyclist. The 36-year-old Scot, who picked up two gold medals at London 2012, says the home support has been incredible and couldn't be replicated in Rio. ""The only thing I'd like to continue on to is the Commonwealth Games in two year's time because that will be another home Games in Glasgow and the perfect way to end my career,"" he said. Hoy completed his Olympic odyssey with victory in the Keirin on the final day of competition in the velodrome last Tuesday -- a win which preceded an emotional medal ceremony. ""The night before I was watching Felix Sanchez get his medal in the 400m hurdles. I've never met the guy, but just seeing the raw emotion, the sheer delight and release ... I was welling up myself. So I think I knew when I got up there (on the podium) that it was going to be emotional moment for me,"" Hoy told CNN. Cycling's glamor girl Pendleton ponders next career move . Hoy's tally of six gold medals sees him become Britain's most decorated Olympian, overhauling rower Steve Redgrave's total of five. Since the competition finished in the velodrome, Hoy, the fastest man on two wheels, has had the chance to watch the fastest man on two legs, Usain Bolt. ""I was fortunate enough to see him in action (in the 200m final). I've seen him many times before on TV, but you never get an idea of just how impressive the performances are until you see them live,"" Hoy said. Bolt, he says, is the face of the Games and an Olympic icon, but the Olympics isn't about just one person. ""It's about stories, individual stories -- whether it's defeat or success. Human stories, that's what makes the Games special,"" Hoy said. ""It's as much about these emotional moments as they are about the gold medal-winning athletes.""","Champion cyclist Chris Hoy says London 2012 are ""as good as it can get at an Olympics""
