"By . Sophie Jane Evans . 'Victimised': Carol Howard, 35, today claimed she was 'smeared as a child predator' by Scotland Yard after winning a racism case against the force . A glamorous black policewoman who became Scotland Yard’s poster girl for policing of the 2012 Olympics today claimed she was 'smeared as a child predator' after winning a racism case against the force. Carol Howard, 35, an armed officer in the elite Diplomatic Protection Group, sobbed as she told of how she had endured a long campaign of harrassment by senior officers. This included her being painted as a 'sex offender', she told the Central London Employment tribunal. Mother-of-two Mrs Howard won a racism and sex discrimination case against the Met earlier this month after being bullied by a senior officer. The tribunal met again today to rule on the amount of compensation she is entitled to receive from the force. Donning a leather mini-skirt, a white shirt and gladiator sandals, Mrs Howard told the hearing that she has been arrested three times since bringing the case against the force. She has been investigated for assault, harassment, making threats to damage property, perverting the course of justice, witness intimidation and possession an indecent image of a child. But in a witness statement, Mrs Howard, who was suspended from duty until yesterday, said the Metropolitan Police had ‘deliberately and maliciously smeared’ her. She told the tribunal: 'I have been unfairly and unjustly smeared not only as a criminal but as a child predator because of misleading information deliberately and maliciously provided to the media by the police. 'I have always denied attacking my husband to whom I am still married. As for the alleged indecent image, it is a single innocent picture of my own six-year-old daughter shared with her father only, which the CPS have already alluded is not in the public interest to pursue. 'I am being advised separately in . relation to all these matters. My husband and I remain fully committed . in being good parents and role models to both of our children.' Scroll down for video . Poster girl: Ms Howard became the Metropolitan Police's poster girl for policing of the 2012 London Olympics . Mrs Howard was one of only 12 female officers - and just two black women - in the Diplomatic Protection Group. Earlier this month, the judges ruled she was the victim of . sexual and racial discrimination while working in the unit. Today, Mrs Howward directed her criticism at Met Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe for playing down the victimisation while she was a frontline officer. She said: 'I feel so angry, confused and upset. The Commissioner [said] that the actions surrounding my mistreatment were caused by one individual only. Video courtesy of Press TV . Earlier hearing: Mother-of-two Mrs Howard won a racism and sex discrimination case against the Met earlier this month after being bullied by a senior officer. Above, the officer is pictured arriving at a hearing in April . 'The truth was it was a collection of . officers for whom he is responsible and who played a collective part in . discriminating and victimising me, and the policies that the MPS has in . place to deal with discrimination. 'This is also supported in the tribunal’s judgement. The Commissioner in interview played down the tribunal’s findings and he was dismissive of it. 'Watching it was like adding insult to injury. He did not seem to grasp what his organisation had done was simply wrong and he appeared to be in denial.' Mrs Howard also claimed Scotland Yard had been feeding information to the media 'maliciously' about her arrest for alleged assault after it lost the high-profile suit. Case: Donning a leather skirt, a shirt and gladiator sandals, Ms Howard told the Central London Employment tribunal (pictured) that she has been arrested three times since bringing the case against the force . She said. 'The Metropolitan Police . introduced these matters to the press which were strategically and . conveniently timed for the sole purpose of damaging and denigrating my . good reputation. To make me unemployable. 'There is absolutely no viable or justifiable reason for this. This in itself is a vindictive act which is meted out to officers who seen to challenge and speak up about their experiences surrounding unfair treatment and unethical practices in the service.' Mrs Howard was told by the Met Police that it had lifted her suspension at 4pm yesterday afternoon. She said it was 'purely with today’s tribunal in mind' and labeled it 'absurd'.

Melissa Woods had just dropped her children at school on the Gold Coast in southeast Queensland and was returning home on the M1 motorway when a wrecking ball detached from the car in front of her and 'shot like a missile' through her windscreen. Luckily for Mrs Woods, the ball crashed through the passenger side of the car, where one of her children had been sitting only moments before. 'There was a God almighty crash and the windscreen smashed. It was very, very scary,' Mrs Woods said. 'It wasn't until I stopped the car that that it really hit me. What if my kids had been in the car? What if I had been hit?' Melissa Woods was driving home after dropping her two children at school, when a 10 kilogram towball smashed through her windscreen after detaching from the car in front of her.

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . Students at Ohio University could be forced to attend mandatory re-education classes if they are caught flouting the campus's smoking ban. The university in Athens plans to outlaw the use of cigarettes and e-cigarettes on any part of the 1,850-acre public campus during the 2015-16 academic year. If caught smoking, students could be made to attend a series of smoking cessation programs and classes to help them quit. University: Students at Ohio University (pictured) in Athens could be forced to attend mandatory smoking cessation classes if they are caught flouting the campus's smoking ban during the 2015/16 academic year . It is the latest in a string of anti-smoking policies to be implemented at U.S. universities. Institutions to have enforced such bans so far include Ohio State University, San Diego State University and every public college in Georgia. Officials said the ban at Ohio University will be enforced with a 'community, Good-Samaritan kind of model' across all parts of the campus. There will be no designated smoking zones. Ryan Lombardi, vice president for student affairs, told The Athens News: 'You can't use tobacco on university property. On the grounds, in the buildings, on the sidewalk the university owns.' Banned: The university plans to outlaw the use of cigarettes and e-cigarettes on any part of the 1,850-acre public campus (file picture) But he added: 'We can't control anything that happens outside of the university grounds.' Students who repeatedly refuse to abide by the ban will be sent to the taxpayer-funded university's Office of Community Stands to 'talk to somebody'. Those who wish to quit smoking will be offered health-insurance-covered smoking cessation classes, said Mr Lombardi. But those who continue flouting the campus ban could also be forced to attend the classes. 'You . don't need to threaten people with fines, said Mr Lombardi. 'I get it, I . don't want to dismiss that argument as a valid argument, but it also . feels like a middle school or high school approach.' However, he said he did not wish for the campus to 'become a police state', and that students who refuse to be re-educated would not be expelled. Earlier this month, Athens City Council spokesman Steve Patterson expressed concern about the university's new anti-smoking policy. He said he feared it would increase the number of cigarette butts left lying on the city's sidewalks, saying: 'It's going to drive anybody who chooses to smoke cigarettes out onto the public right-of-way.' As the U.S. Government has not implemented a nationwide federal smoking ban, anti-smoking policies differ between states. Under current Ohio law, smoking is banned in workplaces and other enclosed public places. Ohio University is currently working on a number of initiatives to inform students about the new anti-smoking policy.","University plans to ban use of cigarettes and e-cigarettes during 2015-16 .

"By . Lucy Thackray . They may seem like hilarious YouTube clips, but they have received more than 30 million views worldwide and the Peterson brothers are on a crusade to tell the world the truth about farming. Their next stop is Down Under, with the American brothers taking a break from the family farm to perform to Aussie audiences. The brothers will perform at the Australian Cotton Conference at the Gold Coast, Queensland on August 7, before a performance for GippsDairy in West Victoria on August 9. Scroll down for videos . The Peterson brothers YouTube videos are adding a bit of spunk and humour to give agriculture an image makeover . Greg, Nathan and Kendall Peterson film their clips on their family property in Kansas . The clever, informative lyrics show that the brothers have both brains and braun! The notoriety the brothers have gained is enormous achievement for three American brothers, living and working on a fifth generation family farm in a small town called Assaria in central Kansas. The Peterson Farm Bros have an impressive catalogue of hilarious farm-themed parody songs, which all began with their song ‘I’m Farming and I Grow It,’ to the tune of LMFAO’s ‘I’m Sexy and I Know It.’ 23-year-old Greg Peterson is the oldest of the trio and the mastermind behind most of The Peterson Farm Bros’ songs. He works on his family farms and performs with his younger brothers, Nathan, 20, and Kendall, 18. Their 14-year-old sister Lauren also makes cameo appearances. ‘I was at dinner with some friends and sang ‘I’m Farming and I Grow It’ and got a laugh. It was all joking around,’ says Mr Peterson. ‘We made the first YouTube video for our family and friends but it took off in a way we could have never even dreamed of, it’s unbelievable how big it’s become.’ The clip was watched one million times in the first four times. Today it has been viewed 9 million times and they have added many other songs to their repertoire, including ‘Chore’ (Katy Perry’s ‘Roar’) and their hilarious Gangnam Style parody clip, ‘Farmer Style’ to huge success. At the heart of these videos is a serious message, which is communicated with the use of social media, music and comedy. ‘Humour is really important in reaching our audience – it’s the bridge to connect with the people not in farming wouldn’t be watching our video if they weren’t funny with funny music . ‘We’re really passionate about debunking all the things people believe about agriculture that are not true. I want to correct the mistruths and get the truth out there, to be an advocate for what’s right and truthful’ The filmclips feature hilarious but also beautiful images of farm life . Greg Peterson writes of his concerns on a blog and as well as performing their songs, give presentations that explain the importance of agriculture. ‘There are people that think of today’s farmers as huge, industrial farmers, concerned not about ethics and animal welfare, but motivated rather by greed and money. This could not be further from the truth!’ Greg has a degree in Agricultural Communications & Journalism, with a minor in music performance. His brothers are both currently studying other degrees in the Kansas State University's agriculture program. 'I’ve always kind of been a musician who happens to farm but my brothers are farmers that happen to sing. 'I like how we’ve happened to blend music and farming and hopefully we can continue to do that for the rest of our lives, but the goal has always been for all three brothers to farm together on our farm. We really love carrying on that family tradition.' Greg Peterson believes people don't appreciate the importance of farmers. 'Agriculture is becoming more and more important and people are definitely unaware just how crucial it is. There are also a lot of issues now. There are more and more people to feed but less land to try and produce food on.' The Peterson brothers will be in Australia in August to spread their message about the importance of farming . The boys are not afraid to make fun of themselves to make others laugh, as they film hilarious clips around the farm . 'We are dedicating our lives to farming because it is fun and carrying on the family tradition makes it the right choice. But it's also because we know we are feeding the world and working in such an important industry. The Peterson Bros are looking forward to taking the conversation to Australia. 'I’m sure Australians will understand our message about people not respecting farmers any more and accusing farmers of doing things they're not, so I think Australians will appreciate the message of needing to advocate farming more because I’m sure they’re going through a lot of the same things we are.'","YouTube boy band sensation touring Australia NEXT week .

"By . Lucy Thackray . The family of a Sydney nun who perished on Flight MH17 have released a moving poem that was close to Sister Philomene's heart and she used to help others who were grieving find the strength to carry on. Sister Philomene Tiernan, 75, had visited the grave of the poem's author, Saint Madeleine Barat, in France, as part of her trip through Europe. She had also been in Europe to commemorate the death of her uncle whose fighter plane was shot down over Germany in World War II. Scroll down for video . Sister Philomene Tiernan was in the Netherlands last month with 10 other relatives to pay her respects to her uncle, RAAF gunner Patrick Tiernan, whose plane was shot down in WWII . Think of stepping on the shore and finding it heaven, . Of taking hold of a hand and finding it God's hand, . Of breathing a new air and finding it celestial air, . Of being invigorated and finding it immortality, . Of passing from storm and tempest to an unknown . And waking and finding it home . Sister Philomene Tiernan was in the Netherlands last month with 10 other relatives to pay her respects to her uncle, RAAF gunner Patrick Tiernan. The 75-year-old's sister-in-law, Jillian Tiernan, had been by her side in Europe before the nun farewelled them at the airport in the Netherlands - the same airport Sister Philomene returned to some weeks later to board the doomed Malaysian Airlines flight. 'Phil was so dearly loved by our whole family,' Ms Tiernan told Daily Mail Australia. 'I've spoken with the family who took her to the airport and she said she was in such great spirits and was really looking forward to coming home. 'It's a relief to know that she was in such a happy place. I am so sad for those families who might not have comfort like that. 'The worst part is the not knowing.' Ms Tiernan shared an incredible bond with Sister Philomene, which began when she was taught by the nun at a catholic girls school in Brisbane. Sister Philomene attended the commemorative service in the Netherlands some weeks before she herself passed away . 'I've known Phil a long time,' she said. 'I met her at school when she was my teacher and then I married her little brother, Dermot.' Dermot was killed in tragic circumstances back in 1993 when he tried to break up a fight at a pub he owned 270km north-west of Brisbane known as The Australian Hotel. 'It is very sad to have two of our family taken in such tragic circumstances,’ Ms Tiernan said of losing her husband and sister-in-law. 'Phil and Dermot were so close - we are all such a close family. 'She was wonderful to all her nieces and nephews, and now grand-nieces and nephews.' Sister Philomene (third from right), her nephew Dermot Tiernan (fourth from left) and her sister-in-law Jillian Tiernan (fifth from left) pictured together in the Netherlands in June . Just a few days before Sister Philomene was killed, she welcomed news of a new grand-niece that had been born. 'I sent Phil photos of little Aislin and she couldn't wait to come back and meet her. She sent emails saying how delighted she was and that she couldn't wait to come home,' Ms Tiernan said. 'I don't think it's fully hit us yet. My son Richard is getting married in December and he called out of the blue and said ""she won't be here, she won't be at the wedding"". You keep realising more and more what a huge loss she'll be from our lives.' Ms Tiernan told of a poem Sister Philomene 'held dear to her' and used when she was counselling other people through grief. The poem's author, Saint Madeleine Sophie Barat, was the founder of the Society of the Sacred Heart - a group that founded three Australian catholic schools where Sister Philomene had worked over the years. Sister Philomene had visited the poet's grave while she was in Europe. Her sister-in-law, Jillian Tiernan (pictured here with her son), had been by her side in Europe before the nun farewelled them at the airport in the Netherlands .","The family of Sister Philomene Tiernan released the poem she used to counsel others who were grieving .

"By . Lucy Thackray . After an 12-year long legal battle, the grieving parents of 15-year-old Scots college student Nathan Chaina have been ordered to pay $8.3 million of the school's legal fees. The Chaina family were seeking compensation for the death of their son at a school camp in 1999, but instead are finding themselves $7,770,869 out of pocket. In May this year, the eastern Sydney school's operator, the Presbyterian Church Property Trust, was ordered to pay the family $492,373 - a fraction of the $100 million the family were seeking. Nathan Chaina (right) died on a school camp run by The Scots College in 1999. His father George (left) has been ordered to pay the school more than $8 million in legal fees . Jean-Pierre Chaina, Nathan Chaina's brother says the family are devastated by the court's latest rulings. 'This is an absolute tragedy, an abuse of process and denial of justice,' Mr Chaina told Daily Mail Australia. On October 23, 1999, Nathan Chaina drowned after falling into a river during a school camp at The Scots College's Glengarry campus in the Kangaroo Valley. Nathan's younger brother, Matthew witnessed the accident. The last photo of Nathan Chaina (left) with his brother Mathew, taken during the school excursion in which he lost his life. In May this year, Justice David Davies awarded the Chainas $429,373 saying they were able to return to work a few years after the tragic incident. On Thursday, Justice Davies said that, with interest, they were entitled to $529,131 but must pay 70 per cent of Scots' total legal costs since June 2003, when the couple were first offered a settlement of $350,000 each. Justice Davies says it is unreasonable for the couple to continually reject offers and have been responsible for the length and cost of the case. The Chaina family, pictured leaving court in May 2014 . In 2002, Nathan's parents, George and Rita Chaina claimed damages for nervous shock and for the effect of their son's death on their cleaning product companies. They also claim their companies, Proton Technology Pty Ltd and Deluxe Chemicals Pty Ltd, lost millions of dollars because of the trauma they had experienced after their son's death. During his ruling in May, Justice Davies also ruled that the mental harm the pair had gone through had disintegrated by 2011. He said the couple's failure to engage in the relaunch of their companies' products was not the school's fault. Scots College student Nathan Chaina fell into a flooded river at Kangaroo Valley and drowned on October 23, 1999, when he was 15 years old. Justice Davies went on to say Mr Chaina was not a 'witness of truth' and had not given consistent replies during evidence. '(Mr Chaina) had a fixed and almost delusional view about himself, his own abilities and expertise and about the success and reputation of his companies, in the face of strong evidence to the contrary,' he said. 'He said whatever he believed would help him to win this case and obtain very substantial damages. 'This was at least partly motivated by his desire for vengeance.' 15 year old Scots College student Nathan Chaina drowned at a school camp in 1999 . The state's Deputy Coroner Jan Stevenson previously ruled The Scots College was to blame for the tragedy. '[Nathan's] death is primarily attributable to the school overlooking ordinary aspects of human nature together with a lack of risk management and safety procedures,' Ms Stevenson said in 2001. The teenager was reported missing for about 15 hours before his body was found in Yurrunga Creek in Kangaroo Valley. It was 24 hours after he fell into the water when crossing the creek. Nathan was separated from the excursion group because of heavy flooding. The Scots College is an elite all-boys private school in Sydney's eastern suburbs. The Chaina family spent $20 million on legal fees last year alone. 15 year old Scots College student Nathan Chaina drowned at a school camp in 1999 .","Grieving parents ordered to pay Scots College in Sydney, $8.3 MILLION .

"By . Lucy Thackray . For more than four weeks, a streetlight has been blocking a turning lane in a busy Victorian town, and there appears to be no rush to move it. This bizarre but frustrating tale began when the median strip was moved in the Bendigo suburb of Strathdale, in a bungled attempt to create a new turning lane. While the other lights have been moved, one straggler has been left standing alone in the middle of the street waiting for the green light to be moved. The pole has been standin in the middle of the road in Condon Street Strathdale, for more than a month . Bungled road construction: The streetlight is bizarrely protruding out of the middle of the newly constructed turning lane on Condon Street, Strathdale . It was hoped that the pole would be placed on the median strip, but it is instead stuck in the middle of a lane on Condon Street, Strathdale . A phone call to the electricity distributor is the simple solution. A safety audit from the company contracted to create the new turning lane, Fabcot Pty Ltd, is required before the street light can be moved back onto the median strip - a straight-forward but vital procedure. The electricity distributor responsible, Powercor, say they are ready and waiting, but are yet to receive a call from Fabcot. Powercor spokesman Lyall Johnson says the problem is that the developers did not do their homework before starting road constructions on Condon Street. ‘At this stage Fabcot has not completed the required final audit and submitted it to Powercor. It is entirely in Fabcot’s hands.’ The Powercor website gives clear instructions for how to organise moving a street pole or street light . Motorists are unable to use the new turning lane as there is a giant streetlight stuck in the middle of it . Pictures show that the turning lane has been blocked off by a row of traffic posts, with the street pole dangerously placed in the middle of the lane. For a month the streetlight has been stuck in the middle of the lane on Condon Street, Strathdale . The pole in question is owned by the Maben Group, which is building a new supermarket at nearby Kennington. Fabcot has been contracted by the Maben Group to create the new turning lane and relocate the poles. This has evidently not gone to plan. The pole was originally situated on a larger median strip, which has been made narrower to accommodate the turning lane, leaving the power pole in the middle of the road. Powercor’s role is to ensure the pole complies with network safety audit requirements before it can be moved onto the median strip. The light is meant to sit on the new median street, but the developers have not contacted the electricity distributors so are unable to move the pole. Powercor tried to take matters into their own hands, but Fabcot's involvement is crucial. 'We sought advice from VicRoads on whether the pole could be moved onto the median strip but not connected to power, but VicRoads would not agree. ‘Moving the pole before a safety audit means it could not have power connected to it or have power running through it to other lights which would disrupt power to a further 10 main road lights for some months.’ VicRoads Regional Director, Mal Kersting, confirms VicRoads have nothing to do with the roadworks. 'The current road works in the area are private developer funded works associated with access to new shopping centre that is currently under construction. These are not VicRoads works.' 'This lane remains closed to any traffic and VicRoads will only authorise the opening of the lane when all related road works and access to the new development are completed.' Fabcot could not be contacted for comment.","Construction mistake leaves streetlight STUCK in the middle of busy road .

The driver, whose company was hired by Families SA, was arrested last Sunday night after he allegedly raped the girl that afternoon when he was driving her to her care home. A 49-year-old driver employed by Families SA allegedly raped a teenage girl while he was taking her to her care home . The man was bailed on conditions preventing him contacting or transporting children, and Families SA was told of his arrest on Monday. Police have launched Operation Harlem and are combing the man's work history in a bid to identify if there are more alleged victims. Families SA has told police it will notify the carers and relatives of all children who had contact with the driver. Families SA is part of the Department for Education and Child Development.

"By . Lucy Thackray . Officials have been collecting DNA samples from relatives of families who were on board Malaysia Airlines MH17, as well as conducting extensive interviews with close family as they attempt the difficult process of identifying the bodies from the airline. The families have also been contacted daily by a counselor provided by the airline to check on their well-being. A relative of nun Sister Philomene Tiernan, 75, who was on the plane, said officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade took DNA samples from her sister, Madeleine. She was also asked in a five-hour interview to detail all her sister's clothes, jewellery, likely handbags and provide as many photographs as possible to help Australian crash investigators identify her body. Scroll down for video . Sister Philomene Tiernan was a cherished part of the Kincoppal-Rose Bay school community who passed away in the MH17 crash . Sister Phil is being celebrated as a kind, loving woman who guided the students of Australia's three Sacred Heart schools: Kincoppal-Rose Bay in Sydney, Sacre Coeur in Melbourne and Stuartholme in Brisbane. ‘It has been a big process. Phil’s [Philomene's] last living sibling, Madeleine, underwent a four or five hour process with DFAT to make sure they have everything possible to find our Phil,' Jillian Tiernan, her sister in law, said. ‘Madeleine gave a sample of her DNA. She gave details about Phil’s handbag, her jewellery, anything Phil would have had on her. ‘Madeleine gave lots of photos of Phil so they know exactly what she looks like, so they have every chance of finding her.’ Mrs Tiernan said the family believed the Australian Government was doing all could to bring the bodies of their loved ones home. Mrs Tiernan admits that there is so much uncertainty with the investigation and reports from the Ukraine that up to 100 bodies were still missing. ‘I don’t think the government knows what is happening next, but they’re doing everything they can to keep us informed along the way. We all need to have hope.’ Jillian Tiernan (front and centre, with frame on lap) and Sister Philomene Tiernan (sitting, far right) with other members of the Tiernan family in June, at a memorial for Patrick Tiernan in the Netherlands . Sr Phil Tiernan (pictured) and her nephew, Dermot (left) together in June in the Netherlands, honoring the memory of Patrick Tiernan, who was gunned down in WWII . Jillian Tiernan says there was pain in not knowing when their Phil will be brought home. 'We have lots of memorials planned, but we won't know when to hold the funeral until we have the body. It's so hard not knowing,' she said. As someone who has lost a family member, Mrs Tiernan says they just hope that there will be a peaceful resolution as a result of this tragedy. 'You can just hope that everyone works to bring some peace to the region. You hope that all those deaths will not be in vain and that somehow, something good comes of it.' Mrs Tiernan is grateful for the support they have received from the Australian government. ‘DFAT has offered every support.

"By . Lucy Thackray . Low-income earners could get 90 per cent of their childcare payments subsidised - including the use of nannies - under a recommended overhaul of Australia's childcare system. It's a reform mother of three, Rosie Harrison, from Gosford, on the NSW central coast, says is crucial if the government wants more mothers to join the workforce. Ms Harrison can only afford a nanny once a week but she says a nanny's help is still invaluable in allowing her to juggle her career and raise her three children, sons Aston, two, and Ashur, six, and daughter Milla, five - particularly when one child is sick. On the two days she doesn't have a nanny, her youngest, Aston, is in childcare. Scroll down for video . Rosie Harrison relies on the help of a nanny to manage balance her career and caring for her three children . Aston, 2, Ashur, 6 and Milla Harrison, 5 benefit from the care of a part-time nanny . So the draft Productivity Commission report calling for the government to extend subsidies to qualified nannies and other in-home care could give families more options and flexibility, particularly for shift workers, is a reform Ms Harrison would support. The draft Productivity Commission report into child care on Tuesday recommended the government spend an extra $2 billion a year on supporting working parents. It's anticipated these changes would enable around 47,000 mothers to return to work. 'Mothers should be encouraged to return to work but no one makes it easy for us,' Ms Harrison said. 'My family would struggle if I wasn't working, but it's also important for me to keep my foot in the door. I need to do it to keep my skills up in the industry, as well as for my mental sanity. The inquiry recommends government subsidies for families employing nannies for the first time - as long as they meet quality standards. The per-child payment would be means tested and paid directly to child care providers and cover up to 100 hours per fortnight . There would be a top-up payment for children with extra needs. Mrs Harrison says a nanny 'is costly but so important' both for herself as a working woman and for her son's needs. 'My son is cared for by people whose sole responsibility is to give him quality care. They do different stimulating activities through the day that I couldn't do with my son. My nanny is only there to have fun and to help him to learn, but when I'm there I need to try keep on top of the washing, cleaning and other household chores.' The Harrison children's mother, Rosie, says women need more support to return to work as mothers . Mrs Harrison says the nanny is crucial to helping juggle all three children, especially when they're sick. 'A nanny really helps when one of your children is sick and you need to keep them home, or with school holidays. There's not enough sick leave to support mothers in these situations and missing out on pay for school holidays four times a year isn't an option.' A study last week found that the current subsidies make it essentially worthless for mothers to return to work, revealing that some mothers only have 1 per cent of their pay left after paying for childcare. A full-time working mother on $43,000 with two-children will use 99 per cent of her wage to pay for care, the research from the National Centre of Social and Economic Modelling reveals. The Productivity Commission suggests the government pay 90 per cent of costs for families on less than $60,000 a year and tapering down to 30 per cent for families bringing in more than $300,000. Families where neither parent works or studies for at least 24 hours a fortnight wouldn't get any payment. The Commission also recommends the government let au pairs on working holiday visas work for 12 months instead of six. Au pairs still wouldn't attract any government subsidies. There was broad support for the national quality framework Labor established but it could be tweaked to reduce costs without compromising quality. The inquiry hopes reforms will encourage 47,000 mothers to return to work . If the federal government takes up the commission's recommendations, the significant changes would affect every childcare user and provider. But the commission says it's worth it. The new system would cost the government about $8 billion a year - roughly $1 billion more than childcare assistance costs now. Many of the 1000-plus submissions to the inquiry suggested redirecting some money from Prime Minister Tony Abbott's planned changes to the paid parental leave scheme. The commission agrees there may be a case for this, saying it's unclear whether increasing paid parental leave would bring significant additional benefits. Opposition early childhood spokeswoman Kate Ellis cautioned that if no extra money was put into the system then any expansion to cover nannies would mean cuts to existing services. Assistant Minister for Education Sussan Ley said she didn't want to pre-empt the commission's final report, due in October.","A report released on Tuesday recommends the Federal Government's childcare rebate cover the use of nannies .

"By . Lucy Thackray . New research has revealed startling new figures about the cost of  childcare - which in some cases makes it financially pointless for mothers to return to work. Mothers on a low income will lose essentially their entire pay packet to pay for two children in daycare, a study by the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling (NATSEM) reveals. A woman in a full-time role earning the minimum wage of $43,000 will only have one per cent of their income left after paying for daycare for two children. Scroll down for video . A study reveals new detail about the incredible difficulties Australian mothers face in paying for childcare . A woman earning the same amount with one child will use 64 per cent of her pay for her child's full-time care. A woman in a full-time role earning $43,000 (minimum wage) will have one per cent of her pay left over after paying for child care for two children . A woman in a full-time role earning $43,000 will have 36 per cent left if she has one child in full-time care . A woman earning the average female income, $66,000, keeps 15 per cent of her income with two children in daycare . A woman earning $66,000 has 44 per cent of her pay after childcare payments if she has one child . National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling 2014 . The research also shows that when parents return to work, the government makes $1 billion more in taxes from childcare than they spend in childcare subsidies. Every year, women with children in child care pay $7 billion in taxes. However, the government only spends $6 billion for childcare subsidies. Goodstart Early Learning Centre commissioned the report to appeal to the government to increase childcare subsidies. Their advocacy manager, John Cherry, said an increase in subsidies is crucial not only to support working mothers, but also young children - particularly those from low income families. 'Australia's subsidies are well below those of most other developed countries,' says Mr Cherry, according to Sun Herald. 'This is contributing to our low level of female workforce participation and denying too many children from low-income households the opportunity to access quality early learning.' In a report last month, NATSEM found that the national average childcare fee has risen by around 150 per cent since 2004, jumping from $30 to $75 a day for 'long day' care. Parents and childcare workers are all appealing to the government to increase childcare subsidies, to ensure the quality of childcare is not compromised . The Abbott government wants to freeze childcare benefit income thresholds and continue to pause the childcare rebate limit at $7500 a child a year. Both measures apply for three years and between them will save $336 million. The Productivity Commission's draft report into the sector will be released tomorrow. The final version will be delivered in October.

"By . Louise Cheer . and Lucy Thackray . There's no doubt that Aussie Rules football is a religion for many Australians, but now a Muslim mother is making sure everyone can join in, designing a line of burqas in the colours of your favourite AFL team. Melbourne mother-of-four Shanaaz Copeland is the mastermind behind Unity Sports Wrap scarves which can been worn as a beanie, wrap or a headscarf. They were unveiled ahead of the league’s multicultural round from July 18 to 27. Melbourne's Shanaaz Copeland designed a range of scarves ahead of the AFL Multicultural Round which are being modelled here by her daughters . Ms Copeland - a devout Muslim - said the idea came about because she wanted her daughters to feel more included when they were attending sporting events at school. She has been working on the scarves concept for the past three to four years. 'My daughters go to an international academy where they wear a white scarf with their uniform,' Ms Copeland said. 'They had a footy day and in wearing footy jumper with their white scarf. They went on sale yesterday and come in all 18 AFL team colours . 'I saw them and thought ""how great would it be to see my girls with scarves in the footy team colours?""' Ms Copeland said sport was a great way to break down barriers and forge friendships across cultures. 'Sport has the tendency to create unity, it brings cultures together… [and] brings about peace and unity,' she said. 'This round of footy shows how supportive the AFL is to diversity with the diverse multicultural backgrounds. 'Australia is really growing, becoming very multicultural, very important for us all to understand each other’s cultures.' The scarves come in all 18 AFL team colours and can be worn by players as well as fans. The Unity Sports Wrap can be worn three ways - one of them is as a headscarf . The range of scarves has been applauded by cultural experts who say it is a step in the right direction . Centre for Australian Community Organisations and Management's Hazel Maxwell, from the University of Technology, Sydney, has commended the AFL for licensing Unity Sports Wrap to create these scarves. Dr Maxwell said the AFL was sending a positive message to their Islamic female supporters. 'Research shows that ""accommodating"" dress codes are one of several initiatives that can make Muslim women, for example, feel more welcome and to feel as though they belong in Australian society,' she said. 'At the Lakemba Sport and Recreation Club in south-western Sydney, such changes over the last decade have turned the club around from a situation where membership was declining at a concerning rate to the point where the number of teams it could field virtually tripled in the space of a few years. 'As well as a flexible on-field dress code, Lakemba Sport and Recreation introduced women-only training sessions, provided culturally appropriate food, sold only non-alcoholic drinks and displayed prominently role models of Muslim women playing football.' Unity Sports Wrap scarves went on sale yesterday. The AFL are also offering anyone with an international passport free entry into any AFL game as a part of the Multicultural Round this weekend .","Mother-of-four has designed a range of headscarves in AFL colours .

"By . Lucy Thackray . The federal government has confirmed that an 18-year-old Melbourne boy was the terrorist in a suicide bombing that killed five people in Iraq last week. Attorney-general George Brandis’ office verified that the boy was living in Melbourne until last year, when he left at the age of 17. The killer was named in a social media post by the extremist Sunni Muslim group responsible as Abu Bakr Al Australi. He is believed to be the first Australian responsible for a suicide attack in Iraq. Scroll down for video . A teenager from Melbourne has been confirmed to be responsible for a suicide bombing that killed at least five people and injured 90 in Baghdad on Thursday . The post on twitter from Islamic extremist group that names Abu Bakr Al Australi, the young Australian responsible for a suicide bombing in Baghdad that claimed the life of five people. Intelligence sources confirm the culprit was from Melbourne, but fled the country through either Perth or Sydney at some point in 2013. It is believed that the teenager detonated a belt bomb in a market place in Baghdad, near the Shiite mosque of Abdullah bin Rawah in the main wholesale market of Shorja. The attack killed five and injured as many as 90 people. The boy is understood to have first arrived in Syria, before travelling to Iraq to become a martyr for terror group, ISIS. The Islamic militant group have celebrated the attack on social media and is hailing the young Australian as a 'knight'. The suicide attack has been condemned by Sydney's Muslim leaders. 'It's shocking for me to hear this because we have tried to promote peace and harmony, not violence,' Sydney Muslim leader Keysar Trad said, according to The Daily Telegraph. The youth is not one of the two Australian teenagers who escaped Australia last month, planning to fight in Iraq and Syria. The post on twitter from Islamic extremist group that names Abu Bakr Al Australi, the young Australian responsible for a suicide bombing in Baghdad that claimed the life of five people. Feiz and Abdullah secretly left their homes in June and flew to Turkey from where they are last known to have contacted family members. They are believed to have been trying to cross the border to Iraq to join the war . 16-year-old Feiz, from Bankstown in Sydney's south west, has been found and is preparing to return to Australia. He and his father are allegedly in Lebanon and will return to Australia with assistance from the Australian Federal Police. Australian teenager Abdullah Elmir's whereabouts remain unknown despite 16-year-old Feiz, who disappeared with him, being found safe and preparing to fly back home with his father . However the second Australian, Abdullah Elmir, 17, is yet to be found. Elmir's family are gravely concerned for his safety and say he showed no signs of radical behaviour before he fled to the Middle East. Attorney General George Brandis revealed the number of Australians believed to be supporting extremist groups at a press conference last week. 'There are probably about 60 Australians in Syria fighting for one side or the other but predominantly the anti-government side, and an alarming number of those people are gravitating towards the Al-Qaeda off-shoot,' Mr Brandis said. 'We have some 10s of people who have already returned and we have probably another 150 who we are looking at here in Australia who have . inclinations to support those two extremist movements.' Online Jihadist recruitment videos are being partially blamed for brainwashing young teenagers to join an Islamic terror group. Abdullah is believed to have been brainwashed by recruitment videos such as this one by the ISIS, titled There Is No Life Without Jihad, which urges people to 'respond to Allah' and 'wake up and be part of the effort'","Australia's first suicide bomber in Iraq confirmed to be Melbourne teenager .

"By . Rebecca English . He may just be nine months old, but Prince George presented his hosts Down Under with something of a conundrum – what do you get the boy who has everything? Well if his first haul of gifts is anything to go by, then a customised skateboard and a possum fur cloak ought to do the trick. The third in line to the throne has been showered with gifts from officials and adoring members of the public in both Australia and New Zealand. One of many: The baby Prince holds a toy Bilby given to him while visiting Taronga Zoo earlier this week. It, along with hundreds of others, will be lovingly shipped back to the UK . They range from his own amphibious vehicle to a full-sized surf board, and his parents have been particularly delighted by his mountain of cuddly toys. The Duke of Cambridge revealed in a speech that his son’s favourite gift was a life-sized wombat given to him by the Australian Governor-General – which George has taken to ‘chewing lovingly’. That very same wombat was seen being carefully loaded on to the family’s plane at Sydney Airport yesterday, as George’s inaugural royal tour drew to a close. Bags of presents – several hundred in all – were also stuffed in the overhead luggage compartment of the Qantas jet. But aides have been forced to arrange for some of the larger items to be shipped back home to Kensington Palace. Strict regulations concerning gifts were brought in a decade ago after it emerged that Prince Charles had pocketed £23,000 from selling valuables he had received from wealthy benefactors. Members of the Royal Family are now barred from selling or exchanging their gifts. Each one must be consumed by the royal, displayed in a royal residence or stored for future use – although low-value items can be given to charity or even destroyed. Now George has begun a collection all of his own, which will be published in the list of official gifts next year.","Nine-month-old prince has been given hundreds of toys on Royal tour of New Zealand and Australia .

"By . Lucy Thackray . Dan McNamee, guitarist from Australian band Art Vs. Science, is campaigning for drugs sniffer dogs to be banned from music festivals because he claims they cause panic induced overdoses. McNamee argues the Liberal government need to stop ‘taking their marching orders from police’ to make sure the health and well being of festival goers is the priority. He said: ‘We need to step back from the legal situation and prioritise health. We need non-politicians and people, maybe like me, to think of solutions that aren’t about force, rules and restrictions. 'We’re a nation descended from convicts, we’re going to break the rules!' Dan McNamee of Art Vs. Science performs on stage. He's campaigning for new strategies to prevent the dangerous 'panic-induced overdoses' he says are caused by drug detection dogs. Art Vs. Science guitarist Dan McNamee, pictured (left), hopes new strategies can decrease the number of festival goers hospitalised due to drug use. McNamee argues that less forceful solutions would be more effective. 'The problem with the Liberal government is that they’re taking their marching orders from the police, much like the lock out laws. That results in solutions that are about violence and power. Ask police how to fix the problem and they will naturally say ‘more tasers, more restrictions, more dogs’ to try and get more power to do what they do best.' On Monday, McNamee posted an open letter on Facebook to almost 90,000 followers, hoping to take action to ‘reduce dangerous drug taking practices’, arguing that the use of sniffer dogs contributes to the misuse of drugs at music festivals. In the letter, McNamee asks to trial a ban on drug detection dogs from this year’s Splendour in the Grass music festival at Byron Bay, in Northern New South Wales. He hopes the decision will potentially decrease the number of people hospitalised for drug use. McNamee argues that sniffer dogs cause the potentially fatal ‘panic-induced overdose.’ In 2009, 17-year-old Gemma Thoms died at the music festival Big Day Out in Perth of a drug overdose. According to her friend, she swallowed ecstasy tablets out of 'fear' of being detected by sniffer dogs. McNamee says that the use of sniffer dogs by police isn’t just ineffective; it’s also harmful. ‘We shouldn’t be creating fear and risking lives, trying to stop behaviour that simply will not stop. Sniffer dogs don’t stop people doing drugs at the festival ground. If the concern is to prevent drug taking, why not look into the use of drug testing stations, like in Spain?” McNamee's open letter was addressed to Don Page, the local minister for Ballina in Northern New South Wales, the region where Splendour in the Grass will take place next week from from July to 27. Today, Mr Page confirmed he received the letter on July 2 of this year, and that he has approached the Federal government with the proposal. Dan McNamee is arguing that police drug detection dogs are ineffective and harmful at music festivals, responsible for 'panic-induced overdoses' 'I passed on his request to the Ministers for Police and Health respectively for their consideration and response. I have no response from either Minister at this stage.' The Australian Drug Foundation’s National Policy Manager, Geoff Munro supports McNamee’s argument that there are risks with using sniffer dogs. 'Sniffer dogs, while they may be a deterrent for some people who might carry drugs into an event have the potential to scare people and may make them panic. 'Reports on high hospitalisations from people swallowing their drugs to avoid detection concern us greatly.' Mr Munro is backing the proposed trial, to make safety at festivals the main concern. He says: “We would support police and festival organisers using other measures to keep festival goers safe and healthy during the event… . 'The Australian Drug Foundation knows the reality is that many people take drugs at musical festivals, so we need to work together to make sure people come home safely.' Art Vs. Science is due to perform at next week’s annual Splendour in the Grass festival for the fifth time. He speaks frankly about his observations of the drug culture and music festivals. 'At this point, it’s clear that people are going to do drugs at festivals no matter what, so we have to do everything we can to keep them safe. People at the 2013 Splendour in the Grass music festival at Byron Bay. A crowd watching a performance at the 2013 Splendour in the Grass music festival. Dan McNamee suggests a sniffer dog ban be trialled at the festival, taking place next week. 'We need to step back from the legal situation and prioritise health. We need to value people’s lives more than we are.'Mr McNamee says drug use has become an inevitable part of music festival culture. ‘I’m not apologising for drug use, but the reality is drugs have become an ingrained part of the festival culture. 'The more police crack down, the more festivals are affected. People will stop going. An example of that is how Big Day Out’s going under and we’re starting to see more underground festivals.' Dan McNamee says people need to be more proactive than just ‘liking’ the post on Facebook. McNamee urges Australians to take the debate away from the screen and contact members of government. 'A proper democracy is about having a debate. Today I found people have liked my letter, but then go off and forget about it. 'That doesn’t do much, that's not the point. Democracy only works when constituents are constantly in touch with their local members, but people have a rant on Facebook or call up talkback radio and that satisfies them.' McNamee hopes that new strategies will be considered to potentially create a safer environment at music festivals. 'What I want is to open up logical debate, so based on evidence we can work out the safest option. Having a trial will at least give us some numbers to work with. 'Some say removing sniffer dogs from festivals will make people take more drugs. I'm not sure, but if it results in less hospitalisations then it's a positive thing.'","Art vs. Science guitarist warns of dangerous 'panic overdoses'

"By . Taylor Auerbach . and Candace Sutton . and Kate Lyons . and Rebecca English . There were parrots, princes and potential princesses lining the Sydney Harbour foreshore on Thursday afternoon as thousands huddled in the shadow of the Opera House for a glimpse of the most popular royal couple in decades. Sunny skies greeted their arrival as a flashing motorcade wound its way down Sydney's Macquarie Street and to a glistening Sydney Harbour. A widely-grinning Kate wore a bright yellow number. William seemed delighted by the sunshine, saying: 'I should have brought my sunglasses.' Prince George rested up with his nanny. As the couple, minus their bouncing bub, peeled through the crowd, screams erupted willing Kate to turn around for a picture. William touched Kate's hand, ushering his wife to give a wave. She obliged and the cheers were deafening. Touchdown: William, Catherine and baby Prince George touch down in Australia as a family for the first time . Jubilant: Thousands greeted the royal family in front of the Sydney opera House on Thursday . Young supporter: Lola Williams hid behind a sign made by her grandmother which she hoped would capture the Royals' attention . Their rockstar-like welcome came amid news that support for the monarchy in Australia is at an all-time high, with only 42 per cent surveyed in favour of a republic. Chrisavye Magdas , 17, was waiting eagerly with six of her family members at the bottom of the Opera House steps. She said she loves Kate 'because she's a princess and she's patron for a lot of hospices and I visit a lot of hospitals - and she's good with kids.' She later gave the the duchess a 'special gift' for Prince George - an Easter candle made by her family in Greek Orthodox style from beeswax taken from a mountain monastery outside Sydney and inscribed with the words 'Christ is risen'. Thrilled: Chrisavye Magdas, 17, loves princess Kate because she is patron of a number of hospices . Among the thousands of cheering locals, interstate and international travellers was was Pierre and his pet parrot Caesar. The Sydneysider hoped his colourful, and appropriately named, bird would attract the attention of the royals when they made their much-anticipated walk through the crowd. 'He'll be making history today,' Pierre told MailOnline. 'The first time a Roman emperor's met a future king...They're bound to walk over to me with a bird on my shoulder.' An uncharacteristically silent Caesar refused to say 'hello' for MailOnline when prompted by his owner. 'He misses his girlfriend Cleopatra,' said Pierre. 'I thought too many princesses in one place might be too much.' Colourful fan: 'Caesar' the parrot was so nervous to meet the royals he couldn't speak . Welcome to Sydney! William and Kate took in stunning Sydney Harbour shortly after landing in Australia . Lorraine Gough, originally from Lymm in Cheshire, flocked to Sydney Harbour with her granddaughter Lola, a commoner 'twin' of Prince George who was also born on July 22 last year. Ms Gough, who waited in the crowd for almost four hours hoped the royal couple noticed her elaborate sign which read 'I was born on the same day as Prince George'. But despite sharing the young prince's royal birthday, Lola Grace Williams was 'not behaving like a princess'. 'It's a long wait in the sun,' Ms Gough said, . 'But it's worth it.' Lookalike: Some found more enjoyment on Sydney Harbour itself... Deafening: The moment Kate obliged a delirious crowd pleading for a royal wave . New South Wales State of Origin coach Laurie Daley revealed he planned to use his brush with royalty to bring some much-needed luck to the Blues. The rugby league legend arrived at the Sydney Opera House early in the afternoon and told MailOnline he hoped to convert young Prince George to his struggling side early. 'I'm really excited, I think everyone is really excited,' he said. 'They've got a great rapport with the nation and the people. I also met Prince Charles so I'll be able to say I've met three generations now...I just can't wait to say G'day.' Asked if he hoped to get along better with William and George than Queensland great Wally 'The King' Lewis, Mr Daley laughed: . 'We never had much luck against the King's teams...hopefully I can have a chat with Wills and a bit of luck will rub off on us.' Nervous coach: NSW State of Origin mentor Laurie Daley said he hoped to convert baby Prince George as early as possible . Sienna Hansen, 8, of  Greystanes in Sydney's west wore a special hat with a fascinator she bought at the Easter show to meet the Duchess. With her parents Annette and Peter she arrived at the Opera House hours before the royals arrived to get in position at the front of the barrier. Armed with a special bunch of flowers to attract the Duchess' attention, Sienna said she wanted to say 'Hi Princess Kate, welcome to Australia' and that she wouldn't mind marrying Prince George - his age difference was not a problem. Norma Frost, 75, travelled more than two hours from Wollongong - on the New South Wales south coast - to meet her second and third generation of the royal family. Three icons: Kate and Wills were massive hits with the Sydney Opera House crowd . She remembers vividly the moment in 1977 she met Queen Elizabeth II, even swapping small-talk with the sovereign. 'I actually spoke to her over in Darling Harbour, I couldn't believe how petite she was,' Mrs Frost said. 'She wanted to know what it was like in Wollongong, how far away it was, she was lovely.' Rockstar welcome: A number of Sydneysiders described the royal couple (pictured with NSW governor) as the most popular Brits since the Beatles . This time around it was the tiny future monarch who inspired Mrs Frost's trip north. 'I want to ask them about how the trip's been and thank them for coming, especially with Prince George being so young,' she said. 'He's so gorgeous and adorable...I'm a big fan.' Security was tight at the Sydney Opera House, where police and sniffer dogs performed sweeps of camera equipment. True love: Support for the monarchy in Australia is at an all-time high, according to a recent survey . One woman had a special reason to see the royals - Marie Gutteridge believes that her four-week-old daughter Scarlett is destined to be the next royal bride. 'She's a lady-in-waiting,' said Marie. Marie was born in the Royal Berkshire Hospital, the same hospital that the Duchess of Cambridge was born in, though Scarlett was born in Australia. 'You've got to wake up now, to see your future husband,' Marie cooed to her sleepy baby, as the cars approached. Scarlett did not seem to pay much attention to the approaching motorcade, but would have been disappointed if she had, as Prince George did not attend the event, staying with his nanny. Manic: Thousands of people clamber for a photo of the most popular royal couple in decades . The Duchess confirmed her status as 'queen of hearts' by spending most of her time on the Opera House forecourt with people in the special area for those with disabilities and health problems. Nina Kiwarkis, a heart-lung patient at Sydney's St Vincent's Hospital said she told the Duchess that she brought joy to many people and asked her to pray for the sick. 'She said she would,' Ms Kiwarkis said. All ages: Fans of the royals in front of the Sydney Opera House included babies, the elderly and everyone in between . Many traveled thousands of kilometres to meet the massively-popular young family. 'We were right there, she looked right at me,' Las Vegas native Diana Hale yelled at MailOnline. 'Oh my God it was like it was the Beatles. My name is Diana like Wills' mum and my husband always says it's about right because I'm such a princess.' Not everyone was satisfied with the couple's initial brisk drive through the crowd, with one middle-aged woman exclaiming: 'what a waste of time, I could have baked today.' Sydney knew it. The royals were in town. What a trip: Tammy Vandjik and Diana, Shannon and Sean Hale said the royal couple 'looked right at them'","Kate and Wills make a mad dash across the city from airport to meet a thrilled Sydney Opera House crowd .

"By . Sally Lee . and Lucy Thackray . Australia's capital state could have its very own landmark Hollywood-style sign. The idea to erect a sign spelling out CANBERRA was put forward by American-born Alicia Doherty who hopes her vision will soon become a reality. The campaign, driven by Ms Doherty who is now a proud Canberrian, could be Canberra's answer to removing itself from the Bush Capital stigma. Scroll down for video . A Hollywood-style sign may potentially be constructed in Canberra to remove itself from the Bush Capital stigma . 'When I was living in Toowoomba I told people I was moving to Canberra and a lot of people were saying ""oh you poor thing, Canberra's so boring!"" but we love it,' Ms Doherty told Daily Mail Australia. 'If Canberra bores you, it's because you're a boring person. There's too much to do. Canberra has an eclectic side with really interesting people.' The founding team member of Events NSW - who are behind Vivid Sydney, Crave Sydney International Food Festival, Breakfast on the Bridge - simply wants her hometown Canberra to have its very own iconic monument. 'It's not that I'm American and want to copy Hollywood,' she said. 'The Hollywood sign is big, memorable, people engage with it, it's really develops a life of its own, it was originally put up to promote that there was land for sale. 'People didn't like the Hollywood sign at first, but people have embraced it. 'But this site doesn't have anything to do with Hollywood other than that it's on the side of hill, it's great for tourism and promotional for Canberra, such a great image, so many great images could come from a Canberra sign on the hill.' However the potential site, a quarry owned by Canberra businessman Lorenzo 'Laurie' Pastrello, is technically in NSW. 'It's a prime location for welcoming people to Canberra,' Ms Doherty said. Alicia Doherty, who's driving the campaign, says the Canberra sign should be big and memorable like the Hollywood sign . 'For many years now Canberra tourism has promoted gourmet food trails and wine districts that are on the outskirts of town, it doesn’t really matter, tourism has embraced its regional areas.' She first spoke to the owner about her idea back in February 2011 as she believes the land has a lot of potential. 'It's a great opportunity to put something there that a lot of people can see,' Ms Doherty said. 'You'd be able to see the sign flying in and out. We'd be able to project images onto it and so many community groups could use it, sporting groups could light it up in their colours, Indigenous images could be projected on it and we can light it up pink for breast cancer.' But the idea hasn't come without criticism. 'There's been a lot very positive reactions because they get that it's not just to put a sign up but to create a landmark,' Ms Doherty said. 'Others think it's tacky, why are we copying another idea? But everything's copied these days, nothing's new, it's about taking something and making it their own. Ms Doherty hopes the community will jump on board the development process, which will source its funding from donations. 'I want the sign to be driven by the community and I'm looking into crowd funding,' she said. She said a competition could be run for the design of the sign, where university students can also submit their proposals. 'I hope people will look forward to seeing it – like the changing Google icon. The sunsets are beautiful, the quarry looks so different at different times of the day, images are endless. If we put up installations and artworks, it could really develop a life of its own.'","Idea was put forward by American-born Canberrian Alicia Doherty .

"By . Rebecca English . Slimmed: A svelte Sarah Ferguson, who last year weighed almost as much as when she was pregnant . Reclining on a fur throw in an eye-catching African print silk blouse and harem pants, the Duchess of York is clearly keen to show off her three stone weight loss. The Queen’s former daughter-in-law has endured a life-long battle with her weight and was shocked into taking drastic action when she stepped on the scales last year only to discover she weighed almost as much as she did when pregnant with her first child, Princess Beatrice, now 25. Sarah, 54, speaking exclusively to Hello! magazine, said: ‘I used to be so angry. I believed I was never going to lose the weight, that I had lost control. I couldn’t fit into any of my clothes. I was just drowning in eating, drowning in food.’ After hitting her heaviest weight since pregnancy she immediately headed to the upmarket Swiss ski resort of Verbier with her long-time fitness trainer, Josh Saltzmann, and embarked on a calorie-controlled weight loss programme, particularly cutting out sugar, combined with daily mountain running. As revealed by the Daily Mail, she also developed her own range of pudding-flavoured teas, including jam roly-poly, to sip on while others tucked into tea and cakes as they returned from the slopes. Over five months she has managed to lose three stone – and says she is determined to keep the weight off this time round. Sarah described the moment she stepped on the scales as frightening. She does not reveal exactly how much she weighed but at her heaviest was known to tip 16 stone. ‘Beatrice was an 8lb 8oz baby and I was only 6lb off my full-blown pregnancy weight. I decided to make a change,’ she said. The 54-year-old took drastic action when she stepped on the scales last year. She enlisted the help of a personal trainer and heading to Verbier ski resort where she cut out sugar and climbed mountains daily . She says the weight loss has affected her both mentally as well as physically. A former Weight Watchers ambassador in the US, the duchess insists she hasn’t  gone on any faddish diet to achieve  her new slimline look, just cutting out sugar and sticking to a ‘straightforward’ exercise regime. ‘It took courage to go out in public in all the years I have been overweight,’ she says. ‘Every time there was a “Duchess of Pork” or “Fat Frumpy Fergie” headline, they didn’t have any idea they were reaching to the depths of my soul.’ The duchess now intends to become a public face of the global fight against obesity and has even been appointed an ambassador  for the Institute of Global  Health Innovation at Imperial  College London.She is also looking to market her pudding-flavoured diet teas which she developed after struggling to combat her sweet tooth. Sarah pregnant with Beatrice in 1988. She said she feared she would never lose weight after childbirth . In 1994, as her marriage broke down, she was pictured looking larger while taking Beatrice to school . In desperation, she went to a master tea maker and asked them to create some flavoured hot drinks to curb her cravings. Together they came up with a range of 17 teas in three ranges. The first is based on English pudding and includes the jam roly-poly, rhubarb fool, strawberries and cream, Bakewell tart, chocolate torte and mint humbug. The second is a variety of ‘mocktail’ teas including pink champagne, gin and tonic, whisky and ginger, and . pina colada. There is also a take on classics including English . Breakfast and Earl Grey. A . friend said: ‘Everyone has been asking her how she has lost so much . weight and of course healthy eating and a hell of a lot of exercise is . largely responsible. 'But . Sarah has a very sweet tooth – it has always been something of a . downfall of hers – and decided she needed to keep it in check.’ Earlier this year, her two-stone weight loss caused a flurry as she left a New York restaurant looking gaunt . The source said the teas had been a huge success and her friends were already clamouring for them. ‘At the moment the teas are just for her but she has had so much interest in them that she is considering whether to market them,’ they said. ‘There are a number of commercial opportunities she is exploring but nothing has been signed yet. Sarah has a very sweet tooth – it has always been something of a downfall of hers – and decided she needed to keep it in check . ‘She swears by them. Like most women she just wants to feel better about herself. She saw a few photographs of herself that she didn’t like.’ The duchess has struggled financially since her 1996 divorce from Prince Andrew, which saw her secure a modest £350,000 cash settlement. Her out of control spending saw her rack up debts of more than £4million in the late 1990s before she went out to work, securing lucrative contracts with Weight Watchers and Wedgwood. She also brought out several successful children’s books. However an ill-fated decision to create a lifestyle and wellness business which later collapsed with more than £1million worth of debts saw her pursued through the courts by creditors. Sarah is now working on a number of projects including a film about Prince Albert and her children’s books.","Last year Duchess of York was 6lb off weight when pregnant with Beatrice .

"By . Rebecca English . The Duchess of Cornwall discovered the perils of wearing pearls around children today. Particularly if they happen to be large, shiny and, frankly, very tempting drop earrings. On a visit to open the new Chelsea Children’s Hospital, Camilla was cuddling 10-month-old Maijed Dhaif when the baby made a grab for her jewellery. The enterprising – and rather nattily dressed - youngster managed to yank the earring from her ear and waved it admiringly. Yoink! The Duchess of Cornwall holds 10-month-old Maijed Dhaif, who managed to pull her earring off, as she visits the Operating Theatre Suite at the new Chelsea Children's Hospital, . Fortunately the royal – who has two children and five grandchildren of her own – took it all in her stride, reassuring wincing hospital staff: ‘Don’t worry, it’s a clip on.’ The Duchess appeared a natural as she cradled Maijid, who was born prematurely at 26 weeks and requires intravenous feeding due to ongoing gastroenterital difficulties, . ‘Holding him like this reminds me of George,’ Camilla said, referring to her step-son, Prince William’s baby. The Duchess was accompanying her husband on a visit to Chelsea and Westminster Hospital’s new state-of-the-art facility dedicated to providing specialist care for children. Caring for more than 75,000 children, both inpatients and outpatients, each year, it is one of the busiest units in the country. Laughing it off: Fortunately the royal - who has two children and five grandchildren of her own - took it all in her stride, reassuring wincing hospital staff: 'Don't worry, it's a clip on' The royal visitors were taken to the Operating Theatre Suite where they met paediatric surgeons operating the UK’s only paediatric da Vinci robot. Its arms move in a way which mimics the human wrist but with more precision, enabling operations to be carried out with more intricacy and less damage to tissue. The Duchess was keen to try it for herself although, when she discovered just how tricky it really was joked that it was rather lucky there wasn’t a real patient there. Charles quickly followed suit, with his wife providing what she described as a ‘back seat driver’ role. Grand opening: The Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall officially open the new Chelsea Children's Hospital, at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in London . The couple also met cheeky little James Middlehurst, son of Sky News presenter Paula Middlehurst, who showed off his prosthetic limb. James, now five, was born with serious leg deformities which meant he might never walk. In his short life, he has undergone countless, often agonising treatments, including the amputation of one foot, and was yesterday admitted to the hospital for further surgery. But that has failed to alter his infectious zest for life and on meeting the prince yesterday he excitedly asked him what football team he supports. Charles, looking a little flustered dodged the question, but when James revealed he supported beleaguered Manchester United, he prince muttered knowingly: ‘Ah, I don’t think we should talk about that.’ Testing, testing: The royal couple also had a go at operating the hospital's 'da Vinci' robot, the UK's first surgical arm dedicated to babies and children . That's clever! The arm enables operations to be carried out with more intricacy and less damage and scarring to tissue . James then animatedly told the Duchess he had just been to see The Lego Movie to which Camilla, mimicking the film’s catchphrase, replied: ‘As yes, my grandchildren have been to see that. It’s awesome!’ The royal couple also had a go at operating the hospital's 'da Vinci' robot, the UK's first surgical arm dedicated to babies and children. The arm enables operations to be carried out with more intricacy and less damage and scarring to tissue. Camilla had most success at the helm of the £1 million state-of-the-art surgical arm, which moves in a way which mimics the human wrist but with more precision. She was soon able to master the device, as a doctor joked: 'The patient is alive!' Charles quickly gave up after struggling to get the hang of the mechanism. Both he and Camilla were later presented with certificates of competence in surgical training. They greeted a number of young patients and their parents at the hospital, which was created through a redevelopment of paediatric services at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. Charles quickly gave up after struggling to get the hang of the mechanism, Camilla had much more success. Both he and Camilla were later presented with certificates of competence in surgical training . Football chat: Prince Charles declined to reveal which football team he supported to a young Manchester United fan . The children's hospital has been treating patients since September 2011. It now comprises four new paediatric theatres, four new wards including a high dependency unit, dedicated children's burns unit, and a neonatal intensive care unit. The new facility follows in the tradition of its predecessor, Westminster Children's Hospital, which was built in 1907 and had its services transferred to Chelsea and Westminster when it was opened by the Queen in 1993. Unveiling a plaque to open the facility, Charles said: ""We are so delighted to come and join you on this occasion. We both worried a great deal that we'd caused enough disruption to the smooth running of this hospital for one day. The children's hospital now comprises four new paediatric theatres, four new wards including a high dependency unit, dedicated children's burns unit, and a neonatal intensive care unit . 'But nevertheless we've had a brief glimpse of the remarkable services provided by the hospital and in particular the children's department. We'd like to congratulate all those who completed the project on time and on budget. It is a remarkable achievement.' The Prince also hailed the role played by nurses and volunteers at the hospital, adding: 'You play such an important part in the life of the capital and the life of the country and you've transformed so many people's lives.' Simon Eccles, clinical director of children's and young people's services, said: 'I hope you've had a flavour of what the children's hospital is all about. It's about all aspects of children's care, educating them, to give them and their families the absolute best care in London.'

"By . Jack Doyle . and Rebecca English . The letters are said to be ¿particularly frank¿ and contain the Prince's 'most deeply held personal views and beliefs' on a wide array of political issues . Taxpayers face a legal bill of tens of thousands of pounds as ministers fight to keep secret details of Prince Charles’s political lobbying. Senior judges yesterday ordered the release of ‘black spider’ letters written by the Prince of Wales to Labour ministers, overturning a ruling by the Attorney General, Dominic Grieve. Mr Grieve, the government’s most senior legal officer, vetoed their release last year, saying it could undermine the Prince’s political neutrality and make it impossible for him to be King. But following the judgment, Mr Grieve immediately declared he would appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court in an effort to keep from the public the contents of the letters. They are said to be ‘particularly frank’ and contain the Prince’s ‘most deeply held personal views and beliefs’ on a wide array of political issues. Last night campaigners called for the veil of secrecy over Royal correspondence with Government to be lifted and for all ‘lobbying’ letters to be made public. A Clarence House spokesman refused to comment yesterday saying it was a ‘matter for the government’. But senior royal sources indicated the Prince was unrepentant about the need for ‘privacy’. A senior royal source told the Mail: ‘It’s important to place this in context. The Prince wrote the letters with the expectation of privacy and the government has since legislated to enshrine that privacy in law.’ Mr Grieve’s decision to appeal the ruling sets the stage for an extraordinary tussle in the country’s highest court between the Government and Rob Evans, a journalist from the Guardian newspaper, over personal correspondence from the future King. The 27 letters were written to seven different government departments between September 2004 and April 2005. Letters from the Prince became known as ‘black spider’ memos because of his distinctive handwriting. Prince Charles at the Prince's Trust & Samsung Celebrate Success awards at Odeon Leicester Square yesterday . The targets included ministers at the business, culture, and environment ministries, the Northern Ireland and Cabinet Office and the health department. They were described in court as ‘advocacy correspondence’ in which the heir to the throne sought to influence policy . Mr Evans asked to see the letters using the Freedom of Information Act but was refused by the Government. Under the law at the time, there was a crucial test attached to Royal correspondence which could only be released if their publication was in the public interest. Attorney General Dominic Grieve immediately declared he would appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court in an effort to keep from the public the contents of the letters . In September 2012 a tribunal ruled that the letters should be released as they fell into the category of ‘advocacy correspondence’ in which Charles promoted his personal views or those of his charities. The Government did not appeal the ruling, but one month later Mr Grieve brought a guillotine down on the release by using a ministerial veto. In his ruling, he warned that it the release of the letters risked suggesting the Prince was party political because his letters include disagreements with government policy. He wrote: ‘Any such perception would be seriously damaging to his role as future Monarch, because if he forfeits his position of political neutrality as heir to the Throne, he cannot easily recover it when he is King.’ But The Guardian appealed the ruling, to the Court of Appeal, and yesterday the court quashed the Attorney’s ruling. Lord Dyson, the Master of the Rolls, and two other appeal judges said he did not have ‘reasonable grounds’ for forming the opinion he did, and it was not justification enough for him to disagree with the tribunal’s ruling. ‘The mere fact that he reached a different conclusion from the Upper Tribunal in weighing the competing interests involved was not enough. ‘He had no good reason for overriding the meticulous decision of the Upper Tribunal reached after six days of hearing and argument. ‘He could point to no error of law or fact in the tribunal’s decision and the Government Departments concerned did not even seek permission to appeal it.’ The Government was also ordered to pay The Guardian’s costs of nearly £100,000. In 2011 the Freedom of Information Act was changed so all Royal correspondence from the Sovereign, the first and second in lines to the throne was exempt from the law. But Graham Smith, the spokesman for the campaign group Republic said: ‘It is now time the government gave up their fight and accepted the need for disclosure of Charles’s lobbying.’ ‘Dominic Grieve’s argument is that it is better to pretend Charles is impartial than to prove he is not. Charles is required to stay out of politics, if he is lobbying politicians then the public have a right to know.’ ‘Royals now have the complete freedom to lobby the government in secret and on whatever issue they choose. ‘The law must be now be changed to allow the public to know when and how Charles and other members of his family are lobbying our government.’ A spokesman for Mr Grieve said he would appeal ‘in order to protect the important principles which are at stake in this case’. A Guardian News & Media spokesman said: ‘The public has a right to know if the heir to the throne is advocating policy or promoting causes to government ministers. ‘We welcome today’s appeal court judgement finding that it was wrong to block the release of the letters. ‘We hope the Attorney General will recognise he has reached the end of the legal road and that government departments will now publish the correspondence so that the public can judge for themselves.’","Royal's political lobbying was ordered to be laid bare by senior judges .

"By . Rebecca English . Accompanied by no fewer than three bodyguards, the Duchess of Cambridge was yesterday spotted dashing into Gap to pick up some last-minute baby clothes for her family’s upcoming tour to New Zealand and Australia. And Kate made sure she travelled in style for her shopping trip, arriving in a Range Rover which had brought her all of 500 yards from her home in Kensington Palace. After her minute-long drive she took 20 minutes to browse the shelves of Baby Gap for her eight-month-old son. Scroll down for video . The Duchess of Cambridge was yesterday spotted dashing into Gap to pick up some last-minute baby clothes for her family's upcoming tour to New Zealand and Australia . The Duchess of Cambridge spent a total of £126.44 and  queued behind other shoppers to pay for her purchases with a credit card. Among the items she picked up for George was a green checked bodysuit designed to look like a shirt costing £12.95. She also bought some denim shorts for £14.95, two navy and white striped babygrows for £14.95 each and a pair of grey and navy striped cotton trousers for £8.95. On the way out Kate – who was dressed in knee-high leather boots, black tights and a short patterned skirt – couldn’t resist picking up two pairs of trousers for herself from the store’s women’s department. Members of staff said the Duchess had become a ‘regular shopper at the store’ since becoming a mother. Among the items she picked up for George was a green checked bodysuit designed to look like a shirt costing £12.95 (right). She also bought two navy and white striped babygrows for £14.95 (left) But Kate soon decided to leave through a side entrance and meet her driver, who had been waiting outside for her on a double yellow line with the engine running. The Cambridges are due to leave the UK on Saturday for the long flight to New Zealand where they will embark on a much anticipated ten-day visit on behalf of the Queen. Their programme includes George’s first official public engagement as a member of the Royal Family. The family, accompanied by George’s new Spanish-born nanny Maria Theresa Turrion Borrallo, will then fly onto Australia for a similar period where a warm welcome is also anticipated. Comfy: She also picked up a pair of £8.95 trousers . Although the trip is, ostensibly, William and Kate’s tour, all eyes will be on the little future king who is teething and has just learned to crawl. An official portrait, released by the couple at the weekend to mark the trip, showed George has inherited his father’s blonde locks and his mother’s dark ‘Middleton eyes’. The little prince was wearing a baby blue cashmere jumper with his name embroidered on it, a present from his doting grandfather. The knitwear was created by Royal Warrant holders Corgi Hosiery. The Carmarthenshire-based company gave it as a gift to Prince Charles to celebrate the birth of his first grandson, who then passed it onto his son and wife. A spokesman for the company said they regularly supply the prince and his family with ‘fine quality’ knitwear and had been producing bespoke hand-finished cashmere personalised baby jumpers for the past few years. Chris Jones, who now runs his great grandfather’s company with his sister Lisa Wood, says he was delighted when they saw the photo. ‘We were so happy to see such a beautiful picture of the prince with his parents and we were thrilled when we noticed that he was wearing our gift,’ he said. ‘The staff who designed and produced the jumper are very excited, as are we, to know that his parents chose to dress him a Corgi jumper for such an important occasion.

"By . Rebecca English . Former IRA Commander Martin McGuinness is set to make an historic trip to Windsor Castle to attend a state banquet hosted by the Queen, it was claimed last night. Two years after he memorably shook hands with the British monarch, Northern Ireland's Deputy First Minister is said to be on the guest list for a white tie dinner in honor of Irish President Michael D Higgins next month. It is believed he has also been invited to a Northern Ireland 'themed' reception, again at Windsor, being hosted by the Queen three days later. Martin McGuinness, pictured attending the funeral of Tony Benn, will attend a state banquet at Windsor Castle hosted by the Queen, it has been claimed . Although both Buckingham Palace and the Irish Government refused to comment, the Belfast Telegraph said last night that he was 'likely' to attend. The Mail understands that invitations to the State banquet have now been sent out, while invitations to the reception are set to be posted in the next few days. Any acceptance would, however, have to be ratified by senior officials within Sinn Fein. The sight of a self-confessed IRA leader dining in the Queen's home would have been unthinkable only a few years ago. But in 2012 - more than thirty years after her cousin, Lord Mountbatten of Burma was murdered by an IRA bomb as he holidayed with his family - the Queen agreed to meet with Mr McGuinness for the first time. On a visit to Belfast to celebrate her Diamond Jubilee, the couple were introduced amid high security at a community reception held in a local theatre. After much behind the scenes negotiation, the Queen shook the hand of the man once named the terrorist group's 'godfather of godfathers' not once but twice. Although she has been at the heart of many events that have changed the course of history, few could have been so intensely personal. The Queen adored her 'Uncle Dickie', who introduced her to her future husband, the Duke of Edinburgh. Philip, a nephew of Lord Mountbatten, was exceptionally close to the murdered aristocrat and took news of his death in 1979 equally hard. Historic moment: The Sinn Fein politician memorably shook hands with the British monarch during a Royal trip to Northern Ireland two years ago . The meeting was equally significant for Mr McGuinness who faced criticism from hard-line republicans who see the Queen as the face of oppression in their country. He made clear, however, that he had been . moved by the Queen's decision to acknowledge the 'sad and regrettable' history of Britain's troubled relationship with Ireland when she became . the first British monarch to visit the republic for a century in 2011. The Queen's cousin Lord Mountbatten was killed by an IRA bomb . Still, the sight of Mr McGuinness dining in the historic surroundings of the Waterloo Chamber at Windsor will be something few who have experience of The Troubles ever thought they would witness. Mr McGuinness has been open about his IRA past, but has always insisted he never killed anyone - claims that have been repeatedly questioned by his critics. His attendance would be particularly remarkable given that Windsor Castle is the one royal residence the Queen truly calls home. The town is also home to the Household Cavalry's Combermere Barracks. The regiment was the victim of the infamous Hyde Park bombing in 1982 which killed four soldiers and seven horses. The President's historic five day . visit, beginning on April 7, is first by an Irish head of state to the . UK. Palace sources have made clear to the Mail that the monarch is . taking a keener than normal interest in every detail. The . President and his wife will be met in London on April 8 by Prince . Charles and Duchess of Cornwall and travel with them for a full . ceremonial welcome in Windsor. After . greet the Queen and her husband they will join the royal couple for a . state carriage procession to the castle, where they will reside all . week. Northern Ireland's Deputy First Minister is said to be on the guest list for a white tie dinner at Windsor Castle next month . The president will take inspect a Guard of Honour and enjoy a private lunch with the Queen before the evening's glittering state banquet. The dinner will be attended by senior royals including Prince Charles, who regarded Lord Mountbatten as his honorary grandfather and mentor. Normally the monarch plays little part in the rest of a visit but on this occasion she will hold a second reception at castle on April 10 before formally bidding farewell to her guests the following day. A spokesman for Buckingham Palace said last night: 'As with all state visits we would not announce the names of invitees in advance of the state banquet. Clearly if people who have been invited wish to make that fact public is a matter for them.' Mr McGuinness, pictured in 1985, has been open about his IRA past, but has always insisted he never killed anyone . Courtiers said the importance of the visit by the Irish President cannot be overstated. 'All state visits are important but this one is exceptional,' said one. 'It is particularly historic being the first inward state visit by an Irish president but also because it takes place so quickly after the Queen's own visit to Ireland in 2011 when she was made to feel so welcome. 'The Royal Household always takes great pride in the hospitality they offer but have very heavily invested in this visit in particular. 'The Queen regards Windsor Castle as her home and the fact that she has invited the Irish president to stay there is a mark of the importance she attributes to it. 'This is clearly something very personal for her and she is taking a very keen interest in every detail.' Speaking ahead of his meeting with the Queen in 2012, Mr McGuinness referred to a famous remark by former prime minister Tony Blair before the 1998 Good Friday peace deal, saying: 'There was a lot of talk in the past about someone feeling the hand of history on his shoulder. 'This is about stretching out the hand of peace and reconciliation to Queen Elizabeth who represents hundreds of thousands of unionists in the north. 'It is about me representing my party, wishing to show the unionist people in the north that we are prepared to respect what they believe in, albeit that we are still Irish republicans. 'I am an Irish republican now - after I meet with Queen Elizabeth, I will still be an Irish republican, and just as passionate about freedom, justice and peace, and reconciliation, as I was the day before.' Lord Mountbatten, a grand-son of Queen Victoria, was murdered when the IRA planted a bomb under his fishing boat off the coast of County Sligo. Although pulled alive from the wreckage, he was fatally wounded by the explosion which also killed his son-in-law's mother, Lady Brabourne, his grandson, Nicholas, 14, a 15-year-old local boy, Paul Maxwell. In the aftermath of the tragedy the Queen took the remaining family under her wing, caring for them at Balmoral, her Scottish home. IRA bomb-maker Thomas McMahon was convicted for his part in the tragedy but released under the Good Friday Agreement.","Northern Ireland's Deputy First Minister 'on guest list for a white tie dinner'

"By . Rebecca English . Prince Charles yesterday called for the quality of food in hospitals to be made a ‘clinical priority’. He wants the NHS to see ‘food as a medicine in itself’ and claims better meals would speed up recovery times. He also made clear that he felt the changes were long overdue and could have benefits in other areas of healthcare including malnutrition among the elderly.

The prince pointed to Mike Duckett, former catering manager at the Royal Brompton Hospital in London, as an ‘inspiration’. Mr . Duckett persuaded hospital authorities to let him open its shut-down . kitchens, hire an organic chef and link up with local farmers in Kent so . that fresh seasonal produce could be supplied to the hospital. He . also set up a restaurant for staff and visitors that made money and . slashed food waste – all on the existing budget. This kind of set-up, . Charles said, created a ‘virtuous circle’ of sustainability, helping the . local economy and ensuring better patient health. Mr . Duckett said: ‘I go for quality over cost each time. For too many years . now hospitals have been using the meals they serve … as a means of . cutting costs, putting pressure on outside catering companies to deliver . cheap and frankly sub-standard food … I actually found it cheaper in . many respects to make the food from scratch rather than buy it in.’ Nottingham .

"By . Rebecca English . Less than 24 hours after details of their tour to New Zealand were announced, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have been plunged into a diplomatic row. It centres on a planned visit to pay their respects to the king of the Maoris, Tuheitia Paki, at Turangawaewae Marae – his people's sacred  place – during a visit to the country's North Island. But yesterday it emerged that the visit had been called off after the king made it clear he was offended that the couple could spare only 90 minutes out of their schedule. Snubbed: Kate and Prince George are on a 10-day stay in New Zealand . According to sources, the long list of demands around the visit and tight timeframe would have broken proper protocol on the marae. So the king told both the New Zealand government and Kensington Palace that the visit was off.  Now William and Kate, who will still travel to nearby Hamilton, no longer have a specific meeting with any Maori leader outside of the usual 'traditional  welcomes' they will receive during their ten-day stay in New Zealand, their first tour with Prince George, which begins on April 7. The meeting was important because not only was it seen as a mark of respect to the indigenous community, but William and Kate would have been following in the footsteps of the Queen and Prince Philip who made the same detour on their visit to New Zealand in 1953. Locals had been planning the couple's itinerary for weeks, saying they were looking forward to welcoming the young royals to the 'heart of the kingitanga', the Maori monarchy. The ensuing furore has forced New Zealand prime minister John Key to make a statement. 'I think it's a shame the couple aren't going, but it's a decision made solely by King Tuheitia's people,' he said. 'My understanding was the palace [Kensington Palace] offered King Tuheitia's people an opportunity for the prince to visit. Respect: Maori King Tuheitia Paki sits on the throne at his coronation at Turangawaeware Marae . This picture of Prince George leaving hospital is the only official public appearance he has made so far . 'They were offered a 90-minute slot, that was longer than pretty much any other engagement that they have, and King Tuheitia's people decided that wasn't long enough and on that basis they rejected him attending.' He added: 'He [Prince William] has a pretty tight timetable [and] 90 minutes by the time you also travel there and back and have to fit in a number of other things, was, I would have thought, quite generous.' Tuheitia Paki, 55, came to the throne in 2006 after the death of his mother, queen Te Atairangikaahu. Maori academic Professor Rawiri Taonui said the cancelled meeting was a snub that needed to be smoothed over. 'It's an awkward, clumsy and glaring oversight,' he said. 'The king may have over-reached in terms of the time that he's looking for, but ultimately I think it's the government's responsibility.' Kensington Palace said there would be numerous chances to meet members of the Maori community at the many traditional welcomes the couple will receive.","Row centres on a planned visit to pay respects to king of the Maoris .

"By . James Tozer . and Andy Dolan . Created: . 18:23 EST, 4 August 2014 . Escaped: Murderer Anthony Craig, 66, fled to Ireland and married a local woman during more than a decade at large - after police failed to publicise the fact he was on the run . An escaped murderer fled to Ireland and married a local woman during more than a decade at large – after police failed to publicise the fact he was on the run. Anthony Craig, 66, had been transferred to an open prison despite previously spending a month at large when he slipped away from prison officers during a compassionate visit to his sick brother. The killer had served a total of 28 years by the time he walked out of Sudbury prison in July 2002, travelling to Ireland where he drifted around doing casual work as an odd-job man. In 1973 the former labourer had lured accountant John Kirby to a park after meeting him at a well-known gay pub, robbed him for just 2p and then battered him over the head with a stone. Police failed to make an appeal for Craig’s recapture until 18 months later, saying they did not have a photograph of him – a statement subsequently branded untrue in Parliament. By then he had fled to the Republic of Ireland where he eventually settled in rural County Leitrim, marrying a local woman, in 2006. His grim past might never have caught up with him had he not telephoned Irish police last year to report a suspected prowler, only for them to realise he was a wanted man. A court in Dublin has now ordered his extradition back to England where he faces being returned to prison to resume his life sentence. Yesterday a friend of his victim criticised the authorities’ failure to trace Craig sooner. Mr Kirby, the accountant son of a Second World War RAF pilot, lived with his widowed mother Margaret in Samlesbury, Lancashire where neighbours this week recalled him being ‘well-spoken and always smartly dressed’. He was drinking at a gay pub in nearby Blackburn in November 1973 when petty criminal Craig – known as Tony - lured him to a nearby by park and killed him after attempting to rob him. An only child, Mr Kirby’s body was found the following morning lying by a dog walker. Craig was jailed for life the following year. He first went on the run in 1995, during compassionate leave to visit his sick brother in 1995.  Craig gave himself the following month, and was later transferred to an open prison, Sudbury jail in Derbyshire. Hideout: The house in County Leitrim Craig shared with his wife Dorothy. He told neighbours he had moved to Ireland after 25 years in the navy . New home: Craig lived in this remote wooden shack belonging to his future wife when he first moved to the area . He walked out in July 2002, but police only revealed he was on the run 18 months later in January 2004. At the time, local MP Patrick . McLoughlin – now Transport Secretary – told the Commons Derbyshire . Police had claimed not to have a photograph of Craig and that ‘no . publicity was given’ to his absconsion, when in fact the force had . ‘decided not to release’ the photo. Craig’s . whereabouts were by then unknown, but the Daily Mail has established . that he settled in Cork before moving to rural County Leitrim where he . met his future wife, Dorothy.  The couple shared her isolated run-down . smallholding, with Craig telling neighbours he had moved to Ireland . after 25 years in the navy. Craig was arrested in February last year, after reporting a suspected prowler to Gardai. The . grey-haired fugitive was hauled to court where he pleaded not to be . sent back, saying: ‘I have rehabilitated – Ireland has given me a . chance.’ After a succession of court . hearings, the High Court in Dublin last week finally ordered his . extradition back to England, bailing Craig until next month pending a . possible appeal. Yesterday . the son of former neighbours of Mr Kirby, airline pilot Derek Barnes, . 55, told of his shock that Craig was able to spent 12 years at large . abroad. Mr Barnes, who as a . 12-year-old used to share bus rides home with the murder victim, said: . ‘It’s completely not right. I’m extremely shocked. ‘Certainly . I would have expected someone to serve their term. He should return to . serve the rest of the term for which he was sentenced.’ Blackburn . MP Jack Straw – Home Secretary until 2001 - said: ‘This was a very . shocking crime, and it’s important that this man is brought back to . serve the rest of his sentence. ‘It doesn’t reflect well on the system that he was at large for such a long time.’ A . Ministry of Justice spokesman said that keeping the public safe was . Justice Secretary Chris Grayling’s ‘top priority’, with prisoner . ‘absconds’ down 80 per cent over the last ten years. The statement . added: ‘Open prisons and temporary licence are an important tool in . rehabilitating long term offenders but not at the expense of public . safety.’ Derbyshire Police said it was still investigating the decision-making process that followed Craig’s escape. Open prisons have been at the centre of controversy after a spate of criminals walked out. Search: Patrick McLoughlin - now Transport Secretary - told the Commons Derbyshire Police had claimed not to have a photograph of Craig and that 'no publicity was given' to his absconsion, when in fact the force had 'decided not to release' the photo . The most notorious was Michael Wheatley, dubbed the Skullcracker, who fled from HMP Standford Hill, Kent, in May, and was caught after a huge manhunt. In June, we told how murdered David Richards, 53, walked out of Sudbury prison and went on the run for nine years until Daily Mail reporters traced him to an address in Wolverhampton after being tipped off about his case. Last week the Mail revealed 137 inmates absconded from open prisons last year, with union leaders claiming the wrong people were being sent to them because of the huge pressure on the system.","Anthony Craig transferred to open prison despite spending a month at large .

"By . Rebecca English . She may not have been born a Duchess. But baby Camilla still came into the world by royal approval. Yesterday her husband, Prince Charles, revealed a hitherto unknown royal fact: that he and his future wife were delivered by the same gynaecologist-obstetrician - but in very different surroundings. The prince made his revelation on a visit to King's Hospital in Camberwell, south London, where, by coincidence, the Duchess of Cornwall was born to Major Bruce Shand and his wife the Hon Rosalind Shand on July 17 1947. Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, holds an 'I'm a King's Baby' bear as Prince Charles looks on during an official visit to King's College Hospital . The man believed to be responsible for her safe delivery was the Queen obstetrician, Sir William Gilliat, who also worked at King's. A year later - on November 14 1948 - Charles was delivered by the same eminent medical man but in the more rarefied surroundings of Buckingham Palace. 'My darling wife was born here but amazingly we had the same gynaecologist and nurse,' the prince told fascinated staff. The couple visited several parts of the hospital including its neo-natal unit where Camilla cheered worried parents and their babies as she cooed and pulled funny faces. She was particularly taken with five-month-old Jessie, who laughed and gurgled at the royal face-pulling. One mother said: 'Camilla was fantastic. She had Jessie in fits of giggles and was so good with him, pulling funny faces to make him laugh' Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall arrive for an official visit to King's College Hospital . The Duchess of Cornwall speaks with Gemma Cherry, 33, and her baby daughter Amelie, 11 weeks, as she visits the neo-natal intensive care ward at King's College Hospital to highlight the high standard of nursing training and the King's Volunteer Programme . Mum Amy Benardout, 19, said: 'Camilla was fantastic. She had Jessie in fits of giggles and was so good with him, pulling funny faces to make him laugh. 'She's a gran herself so she's obviously good with babies. 'Jessie was born with a bowel defect (gastroschisis) last August and we've been here in the unit ever since. 'He's got to have another operation soon to lengthen his bowel, and he'll be here for a year, but the future looks bright.' Before he left Prince Charles told hospital staff: 'The work you do here is fantastic, particularly having seen the neonatal unit and elderly wing- ever more significant with our advancing age!' Afterwards the Duchess was able to see first-hand wash bags now handed to victims of rape and sexual assault that she helped to devise. The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall speak with Jesse Crowden, 88. Later, Prince Charles, revealed a hitherto unknown royal fact: that he and his future wife were delivered by the same gynaecologist-obstetrician . Camilla came up with the idea after meeting victims and discussing what would make them feel 'more human' after going through such a traumatic ordeal and subsequent forensic examinations. With the help of her private office and supporters she drummed up enough donations from companies including Marks & Spencer, Champneys, 2 True and Trevor Sorbie to make up 750 of the bags which are currently being handed to women – and men – seeking help from The Haven rape crisis centres in London. The programme will be trailed on a two-year trial basis, although there are hopes to expand the initiative. Speaking about her idea the Duchess said: ‘When you are ill, the first thing that you want to do is wash your hair and clean your teeth. The same applies here. ‘It is a small something to make women and girls who go through such a terrible ordeal feel just a little bit human again. ‘We are starting in a small way but I hope that we will be able  to expand the scheme. It won’t change what has happened but might offer a small crumb of comfort at what is a very difficult time.’ The Duchess was shown round The Haven centre at King’s Hospital, which is one of three centres in London that help around 140 victims – including men and children – each month. Most are brought in by police but a proportion refer themselves, often after years of abuse or sexual violence. The Duchess met several members of staff including a nurse, counsellors and a senior forensic practitioner who deal with the centre’s clients. ‘It must be quite a daunting experience,’ said the Duchess as she discussed the courage victims often had to find to report their experiences. The couple visited several parts of the hospital including its neo-natal unit where Camilla cheered worried parents and their babies as she cooed and pulled funny faces . The Duchess was shown round The Haven centre at King's Hospital, which is one of three rape centres in London that help around 140 victims - including men and children - each month . ‘Do a lot of people decided they don’t want to take it [reporting their assault] further? ‘I think you all do a wonderful job, thank goodness for people like you.’ After . being shown the wash bags which contained  shampoo, conditioner, . handcream, a flannel, bodywash,  toothpaste and a toothbrush and . mascara, she said: ‘You can’t even change what happened but you can make . the journey better.’ Jo . Delaforce, Matron of the Havens, said: ‘I can’t tell you what this . initiative means both to us and our clients. It makes them feel worthy . again. When you experience something like they have you have no . self-esteem, no self-worth and experience a lot of self-doubt. Many . experience self-blame too. ‘To be given something like this, to enable you to wash and feel clean again and then take home, makes you feel valued. ‘A . few years ago when I went round for donations to some of the big . companies they either didn’t want to know or would only give us . something if their name was branded on the side. The Duchess has made . this happen.’ With the help . of her private office and supporters she drummed up enough donations . from companies including Marks & Spencer, Champneys, 2 True and . Trevor Sorbie to make up 750 of the bags which are currently being . handed to women - and men - seeking help from The Haven rape crisis . centres in London.

Sarah Molland, 25, was on a pubcrawl with friends when she came face-to-face with the huge roadside poster. Her pals had clubbed together to organise the £500 billboard in Cardiff city centre. Ms Molland's friends organised the billboard ahead of her hen do in Cardiff city centre and is a reference to the Russel Brand film Forgetting Sarah Marshall . Ms Molland said: 'I couldn’t believe my eyes - I knew I would be getting plastered on my hen night but not like that. 'My first thought was: ""I’ll kill them” - but I was delighted really. It was very funny.' The 24ft X 12ft billboard is based on the romantic comedy Forgetting Sarah Marshall starring Russell Brand, Mila Kunis, Jason Segel and Kristen Bell. Ms Molland's best friend and maid of honour Rachael Coombs, 25, spent months plotting to put the poster up for the hen night for 15 girls in the Welsh capital.

"By . Rebecca English . Wildlife campaigners have described Prince William’s decision to go hunting just days before launching an anti-poaching crusade as ‘unfortunate’. The future king led a meeting at London Zoo yesterday, in his role as President of United for Wildlife, to develop an international response to the slaughter of endangered animals for their body parts. It was the prince’s first public appearance since spending the weekend at a Spanish hunting lodge owned by one of the richest men in the country, the Duke of Westminster, shooting wild boar and stag. Top guns: Prince William and Prince Harry arrive is Spain with friend Jecca Craig . Finca La Garganta in rural Cordoba spans 37,000 acres, and is one of the most exclusive hunting estates in western Europe. He and his brother Harry flew out last Thursday, along with a group of friends including Jecca Craig, whom Prince William is rumoured to have dated in the past. While the prince’s passion for  saving rhinos, elephants and tigers from extinction was praised yesterday, his weekend activities had not escaped the attention of fellow campaigners. Will Travers OBE, President of the Born Free Foundation, said: ‘I don’t think it was great timing and I personally do not hunt. Dame Jane Goodall, a leading British primatologist, said she agreed the prince's timing was unfortunate . ‘But I would say this – we mustn’t get these two issues confused. ‘This is all about industrial levels of wildlife crime linked to terrorist organisations, which will come to our door if we don’t do something about it. ‘I hope people can, whether they agree with hunting or not, leave that to a different debate and focus right now on wildlife crime.’ Dame Jane Goodall, a leading British primatologist, said she agreed the prince’s timing was unfortunate, but added: ‘The involvement of Prince William and Prince Charles has brought so much attention and it’s so important, because some of these species are actually vanishing.’ In a speech at the symposium, which brought together seven wildlife charities, William told supporters: ‘The forces that are currently destroying some of the world’s endangered species are sophisticated and powerful. 'But this week, we are seeing the creation of an equally powerful alliance, coming together to help fight them.’ The campaigners plan to use new technology to target poachers, as well as those who buy illegal rhino horn, ivory and tiger products such as their skins.","Future king led a meeting at London Zoo yesterday to develop an international response to the slaughter of endangered animals .

"By . Rebecca English . With more than 60 years of foreign diplomacy under her belt, she is the very soul of discretion. Which is likely to suit President Hollande of France – he of the distinctly colourful private life - down to the ground when he hosts a three-day state visit to France by the Queen in June. Buckingham Palace formally announced today that the monarch, accompanied by her husband, Prince Philip, will travel to Normandy on June 5 to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Visit: The royal couple, who will be aged 88 and 92 respectively at the time, will undertake a series of engagements to mark the British war effort on June 6 . The royal couple, who will be aged 88 and 92 respectively at the time, will undertake a series of engagements to mark the British war effort on June 6, before travelling on to Paris where they will be formally received by President Hollande at the Elysee Palace. While in the French capital the sovereign and her husband will attend several state events, before returning to the UK on June 7. Buckingham Palace declined to comment today on whether they had been told President Hollande would be hosting the Queen accompanied by a First Lady. Last month the French leader very publicly split with his partner, Valerie Trierweiler, 48, after his affair with leading actress Julie Gayet, 41, was exposed. Photographs of Mr Hollande, 59, arriving for a rendezvous with his lover on the back of moped were published by a French magazine, resulting in Miss Trierweiler, herself a former mistress of the president, being admitted to hospital for ‘stress and exhaustion’. Overseas: The Queen¿s state visit in June will be preceded by another foreign engagement in April, this time to Italy, when she will fly to Rome for lunch with the Italian President . After days of claim and counter-claim, the president effectively sacked his First Lady with a curt 18 word public statement in which he announced that their ‘shared life’ was over. The Queen’s state visit in June will be preceded by another foreign engagement in April, this time to Italy, when she will fly to Rome for lunch with the Italian President. Her rapidly filling diary puts paid to recent claims that she would not be undertaking any more international trips on behalf of the nation. Although aides admit she has handed her long-haul travel to younger members of the Royal Family, particularly her heir, Prince Charles, they insist she will continue to take on a small number of less-demanding foreign visits as and when required. Remembrance: The pair were last in France ten years ago to mark the 60th anniversary of the D-day landings . In a statement Buckingham Palace said: ‘The Queen, accompanied by The Duke of Edinburgh, will make a State visit to France from 5th – 7th June. Her Majesty and His Royal Highness are visiting at the invitation of the President of France, President Hollande. ‘On 6th June The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh will attend events in Normandy to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Normandy landings. ‘On 6th and 7th June Her Majesty and His Royal Highness will attend State Visit events in Paris and be received at the Élysée Palace by President Hollande. ‘ . The Queen, who speaks French fluently, first visited France in April 1957. Her most recent State Visit to France was in April 2004.

"By . Harriet Hernando . A mother says she will have to take eight buses to get her four-year-old to a school located just two miles away. Janine Micklefield, 38, is unable to drive her son to school because she suffers from a brain condition, while her husband David, 42, works full time. And she says the route to Allerton Bywater Primary School in Castleford, Yorkshire, which runs across fields and rivers, is too dangerous to walk. Janine Micklefield, 38, with son Samuel, four, (right) and  and Amy Shillito and sons Logan, four, and Hunter, nine months, says she will have to take eight buses to school and back . Instead, Mrs Micklefield, who works in shop, says she will have to take eight buses each day to take and collect her son Samuel from school. The journey will involve catching the 168 and 189 from Methley to Allerton Bywater, or the 410 and 168 from Methley to Rothwell to Allerton Bywater. Mrs Micklefield, who works in a shop, said: ‘It is going to be really difficult to get Samuel up and ready for school in the morning - and it will mean his day lasts from about 7am to 5pm.’ She said she applied for Samuel’s place at Methley Primary School - where his siblings, father and grandfather went - early. The school is just a five-minute walk from her . home in St Margaret's Road, Methley. The route shows the journey across fields and rivers from Mrs Micklefield's home in St Margaret's Road to Allerton Bywater Primary School. She had hoped to get a place at Methley Primary School . So she was shocked when the council contacted her after the deadline date and told her she needed to submit her application. After . sending what she says is a second application, she was told the bad . news that Samuel wouldn’t be able to attend the desired village school. She said: ‘My husband works full time so he can’t do the school run and I am unable to get my driving licence because of my condition, which means I faint unexpectedly. ‘Technically the school is only two miles away from our house, but that route means we would have to walk across fields and over a river. It just isn’t safe. ‘It could be really dangerous, especially in the winter as there is no public footpath or street lighting and if I had to go on my own to pick him up I wouldn’t feel safe.’ Janine Micklefield, 38, with son Samuel, four, and her husband David, 42, cannot drive because of a brain condition . Paul Brennan, deputy director of children’s services for Leeds City Council, said there had been an unusually high demand for places in the area this year. He said: ‘We are aware that a number of parents in Methley have expressed concerns about securing places at local schools and we are working hard to address this. ‘This year has seen us managing an unusually high demand for places in the area which we anticipate will fall next year. ‘We will continue to talk to local schools about possible expansion and will do all we can to support parents to get places in a good school as close as possible to their home.’","Janine Micklefield has to take her son to Allerton Bywater Primary School .

"By . Harriet Hernando . Animated films have become the UK’s most popular film genre for the first time. The success of Despicable Me 2, which brought in £247 million, tipped the scales and stole the show from action films- the UK’s former favourite. Figures from the British Film Institute show millions flocked to cinemas to see animated movies like Frozen, Monster’s University and The Croods, all of which bagged a place in the top ten films for 2013. Scroll down for video . For the first time ever, animation is the most popular genre, with Despicable Me taking £247 million . Oliver Hyatt, chairman of Animated UK, said: ‘It’s bonkers that we’ve grown so quickly. The great thing is that in the past 20 years the industry has matured so much.’ Youngsters aged 7 – 24 are the UK’s biggest cinema fans, making up 47 per cent of total admission and have been credited with encouraging the success of animated films. But Mr Hyatt also said the success was also down to developments in the industry. The success of animated films like Despicable Me 2 has been attributed to the fact that young people make up the majority of cinema admissions . He reported: ‘When we have a family film released there is a lot in it for adults. I would argue that adults can sit down and watch Ratatouille. But in the past the films didn’t really cater for parents so they’d just have to go along and sit there with the kids while not getting anything out of it.’ Animation is the most popular genre, with Despicable Me taking £247 million – a £100m increase on the previous year . Youngsters aged seven to 24 are the UK’s biggest cinema fans, making up 47 per cent of total admission in 2013 . Thirty-three animated films were released last year . Three of them made the UK's top ten . They represented more than 20% of the total UK box office . The UK film industry turnover is £7.3 billion, an 11 per cent share of the global box office . Cinema admissions were 165.5 million in 2013 compared to 172.5 million in 2012 . He added that developments in technology meant software was much more sophisticated than in the past. And a shift in cultural attitudes mean more and more adults aren’t snubbing animated films as movies for children. He said: ‘People are beginning to accept animated films as an adult source of entertainment.’ The . figures also indicated that with the exception of Gravity, British . cinema audiences were becoming less enamoured with 3D films. Mr . Hyatt said: ‘It’s horrible to say 3D films are faddy because when . they’re done well they’re brilliant. But it does look like animated . films are taking viewers away from them. This might be because animated . films are generally more suitable for children/ . Most animated films are made in America but Mr Hyatt said the UK market is set to experience some exciting changes. He reported additional funding from the BFI’s Vision Awards, which were launched last year. He said: ‘It’s going to be really exciting to see what happens over the next four years in the UK animated film sector.’","Animated films take over from action movies as most popular genre in UK .

Sharing the love: Another mixed-faith couple kiss as part of the social media campaign 'Jews and Arabs refuse to be enemies' A mixed-faith family joins in with the social media campaign 'Jews and Arabs refuse to be enemies' Sulome, 29, spends her time between New York, America, and Beirut, Lebanon, where her boyfriend Jeremy, who declined to give his surname, lives. She told New York Daily News: ‘It’s not about being Jewish or Arab. Because when it comes down to it, we love each other, He makes me laugh and I feel safe when I’m with him. That’s what matters.’ But the love-match didn’t get off to the easiest start. Jeremy, who has dual Israeli-American citizenship, comes from an Orthodox Jewish family which is supportive of the Israeli government, while Anderson is sympathetic to the plight of the Palestinian people. Her father, Terry Anderson, who reported for Associated Press, was held captive for seven years by the militant group that would later become Hezbollah.

"By . Harriet Hernando . Tiya Chuahan died aged 22 months after chocking on a jelly cube at Dicky Birds nursery in Wimbledon, south London . Nursery staff failed to properly supervise a toddler who choked to death on a jelly cube, an inquest heard. Tiya Chauhan, aged 22 months, fell unconscious during a ‘free flow’ play session at the Dicky Birds nursery in Wimbledon, south London. Staff did not spot Tiya had collapsed until it was ‘too late’, Westminster Coroner’s Court was told. Matthew . Hill, a senior officer at Ofsted, told the inquest the failure of staff . to properly supervise play was largely responsible for Tiya’s death. ‘A child is likely to want to put it [a jelly cube] in its mouth’, he said. Mr Hill said he did not think it was possible to supervise the children properly from the next room. He . said: ‘I always felt that our position, from the evidence that we had . available, was that supervision from that room next door was not . sufficient.’ Pressed . by the coroner Dr Fiona Wilcox on whether the nursery had failed to . fulfil its statutory obligation, Mr Hill replied: ‘Yes’. ‘That could be the case here, simply because Tiya managed to put something in her mouth. ‘I . think that the conclusion that Ofsted came to is that something . happened, there was clearly a set of circumstances at that time that . lead to staff members not being engaged and directly supervising those . children. ‘There certainly did not seem to be an awareness between these staff on what was due between them, in terms of their eyes being turned away from whatever was going on. ‘In Ofsted’s view there was a failure of supervision at that time and then decisions were made in terms of the ongoing registration, on that basis.’ Asked if this failure to properly supervise the children led to Tiya’s death, Mr Hill replied, ‘It certainly was a large factor in it... there was nobody there to respond to Tiya before - really - it was too late. ‘Nobody was suggesting to us that individual staff members were particularly at fault’, he added. The toddler's father, Chetan Chauhan, wept as he gave evidence during a previous hearing at the Royal Courts of Justice in London, which he is pictured leaving . The tragedy occurred at the nursery at around 9.40am on August 23, 2012, when the jelly was being used in a sensory game. London Ambulance crew removed a piece of ‘jelly-like substance’ from Tiya’s airway, the inquest was told. Tiya, who was 22-months-old, was taken by ambulance to St George’s Hospital but died later the same day. Dicky Birds Nurseries is a family-owned business with other nurseries in Wimbledon, Raynes Park, New Malden and Surbiton. The cause of death was asphyxiation caused by a foreign body. The inquest continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Tiya Chauhan collapsed at Dicky Birds nursery in Wimbledon, south London .

"By . Harriet Hernando . School pupils have been forced to repeat an entire year - after a teacher left and took all their work. The sixth form students had to redo coursework after the unnamed member of staff stopped teaching at City Academy in Bristol - and now can’t be found. Officials say the science tutor left the academy last summer but failed to leave student’s coursework behind - meaning they had to retake the whole year. Bristol City Academy said it had been unable to contact the missing teacher, who left with all their sixth form students' coursework . The BTEC Level 3 Applied Science two-year qualification was based on coursework, rather than exams. It meant that 11 sixth form students had to redo the vast majority of work. Learning that the coursework had gone missing in September, several students had to retake one year. The school says at least one student also had to do two years’ worth of work - in just one year. It made several attempts to track down the lost coursework and the teacher to no avail - but assured students they could get back on track. But it has now emerged that at least four students had fallen short of what they hoped to achieve. It left their planned future in doubt after they tried to cram all of the work into the 13/14 academic year. One BTEC student said she was 'angry and upset' by the outcome. Another, a former Bristol Brunel Academy student, said she had regretted enrolling at the academy. She said: 'I wouldn’t recommend going to this sixth form. I’ve gained nothing here in two years and it’s been wasted time for me. 'We trusted the school but it has failed us. None of us have had an apology.' Missing: Sixth form students at Bristol City Academy were forced to repeat the year after a teacher left and took all their coursework . City Academy’s principal Gill Kelly said: 'In September 2013 it became apparent that a member of staff who left the academy that summer had not left behind the coursework she had been marking. 'Despite the academy’s best efforts to contact the teacher and locate the coursework, this was to no avail. 'The students concerned were given assurances they could complete the qualification in the space of a year. 'Teaching and classes were adjusted to do so, twilight sessions laid on after school and deadlines were extended significantly. 'The school regrets that some students were unable to engage with this added level of support and were therefore only able to achieve the equivalent of one qualification, rather than two, although this is not true of all the students in the original group. 'Out of 11 students, four were removed from the course due to either poor attendance or wider issues and three students went on to achieve the grades they hoped for.'","Unnamed teacher left Bristol City Academy, taking pupils' coursework .

"By . Bianca London . The man who eliminated post-sandwich guilt with a bread made almost entirely out of broccoli has added a pizza to his collection of healthy carbs. Paul Shackleton, a London-based City banker-turned-baker who launched Plan Bread - a sandwich delivery business that provides a virtually carb-free, low calorie super-bread made from broccoli - has expanded his range. Paul, who was made redundant from his job as a trader at JP Morgan two years ago, said it took hundreds of prototypes and . samples before perfecting his broccoli pizza recipe. Is this the world's healthiest pizza? A banker-turned-baker has created broccoli pizza, which has 50 per cent fewer calories and 90 per cent fewer carbs than other 'healthy' pizzas . Using all-natural produce and broccoli . as the main ingredient, the result is, according to independent assessments, by some distance the lowest-calorie, lowest-carb pizza . available in the UK. Plan Bread’s special gluten-free recipe has 50 per cent . fewer calories and 90 per cent fewer carbs than the average 'healthy' pizzas on . the market. As a comparison, 100g of popular thin and crispy pizzas have, . on average, 260 calories and 29g carbohydrate while 100g of the broccoli pizza has 125 calories and 2g of carbohydrate. Speaking about his latest foodie creation, which is available with chicken, salami and mozzarella toppings, Paul said: 'We were really proud of the broccoli bread product that was launched last year, but were unsure of how many people would embrace the concept. Tinge of green: Using all natural produce and broccoli as the main ingredient, the result is, by some distance the lowest calorie, lowest carb pizza available in the UK . 'Lots of people signed up immediately for our lunchtime sandwich delivery service, which has now grown to incorporate clients such as Virgin Active and the BBC. It showed us that there must be an unfulfilled desire for people to seek healthy options to what are, on the whole, not the healthiest products. 'The pizza was the next clear opponent. The trials have gone very promisingly and we are thrilled to launch the broccoli pizza product.' Despite having no experience in . oven-based work, the 28-year-old set himself the challenge of creating . the world's healthiest bread. He . spent hours poring over books in the British Library, studying the . latest medical research on how food is stored as fat, and meticulously . devised more than 150 prototypes before arriving at Plan Bread's secret . recipe. A dieter's dream: Using all natural produce and broccoli as the main ingredient, Paul created the lowest carb bread in the UK . Banker turned baker: Despite having no baking . experience, former banker Paul Shackleton taught himself how to make the . lowest carb bread in the UK . 'When we . were devising the original bread recipe we were adamant on all the . ingredients being gluten-free,' he explained. 'This was an effort to . make the bread accessible to more people. However, we have been . contacted by masses of people who are looking for gluten-free solutions . to baked goods that are on the market at present. 'The scale . of the need for coeliac appropriate products seems to far outstrip both . the availability and quality of what is currently on offer. We’re . hoping, in our own small way, to help increase the choice for what seems . to be a vastly underestimated and underrepresented party of eaters. 'In the . long term, we’d love to tackle as many flour based products as possible . and give our healthy interpretation of them. We already have a broccoli . flour scotch egg, but perhaps a range of pies or other savoury items.' Plan Bread . delivers platters, individual sandwiches, pizzas and healthy snacks to . addresses across London as well as stocking shops, gyms and canteens. Bianca London says: 'If there was one food I had to eat forever it would be bread, followed closely by pizza. 'So when I found out about Plan Bread, I was more than excited at the prospect of actually being able to do ""carbs before marbs"". 'It's a cross between an omelette, eggy bread and brioche. On first tasting it, I wasn't convinced, but with more bites, the pizza tasted really good and with the right toppings, tastes very close to the real thing - without the guilt. 'I'm, controversially, not a fan of a good old greasy Domino's so this is the perfect guilty fix for dieters who are partial to . committing the occasional carbicide.' Martha Cliff, Femail's resident foodie, says: 'Whenever I am convinced to choke back a health food of any sort I am always a little dubious, particularly when it is a piece of pizza with less than 200 calories, absolutely no carbs and that counts towards one of your five-a-day. 'The broccoli-based pizza is not exactly like taking a bite out of deep-pan Hawaiian but it is tasty. French toast-like in texture, it is light and spongy and there is definitely a hint of broccoli to the flavour (or perhaps that's just me overthinking the green base?) 'Most importantly, there is cheese, real cheese, and tomato sauce - and in my books if you can eat pizza with CHEESE on a diet you're on to a winner.' Mail on Sunday features writer Charlie Lankston, who sampled the broccoli Scotch egg, says: 'The Scotch egg actually went down a treat with everyone here. 'It tastes way better than it looks and smells and everyone was thrilled at the thought of a low-calorie Scotch egg. We’re wondering whether there’s a low-calorie sausage roll to go with it?'","Paul Shackleton set up Plan Bread to make low-calorie carbs .

"By . Chrissy Iley . Comedian John Bishop has told with heart-warming honesty how stand-up and relationship counselling saved his marriage. In the early days of his marriage he says he was a blunt, unemotional Northerner who was unable to express his feelings to his wife Melanie. But when the couple separated he took up stand-up comedy and started talking about the split during his stage routine. Emotional: John Bishop (pictured with wife Melanie) only learned how to discuss his feelings when the couple split . It was only when Melanie chanced upon him performing that she fell  in love with him again. They went on to get their relationship back on track with the help of some Relate counselling. ‘Both stand-up and going to Relate changed me,’ Bishop said in an  exclusive interview with The Mail on Sunday. ‘I stopped being scared of talking about what I felt. The consequences of not doing that are bigger than the consequences of doing it. ‘When I was younger, I wasn’t very emotional. But there’s a point in your life where there’s nothing to be scared of any more. I just didn’t realise it at the time.’ Bishop, 46, who has now told his life story in an autobiography,  was raised on a council estate in Runcorn, Cheshire. He met Melanie at college in Manchester and they married in 1993. Young love: Bishop married Melanie in 1993 after the couple met when they were at college in Manchester . He assumed the traditional male role, providing for Melanie and their sons – Joe, now 19, Luke, 17, and Daniel, 15 –  through a well-paid job in pharmaceutical sales. However, the long hours took their toll on the marriage, and the couple separated in 2000. In the same year, Bishop made his stand-up debut, having chanced upon an open-mic night at The Frog And Bucket comedy club in Manchester. Enticed by the offer of a free drink, Bishop got up and started talking about his life. He found it therapeutic and was rewarded with laughter, so he did it again – and again. A comedy star was born, although it was a while before Bishop gave up his day job. Some 18 months after that life-changing performance, Melanie came into the club with friends and was shocked to find her estranged husband on stage talking about their break-up. She says this was the moment she began to fall back in love with him. Having discovered that they had both booked time off work for the same dates, the couple decided to go away together with the boys. Devoted dad: Bishop spurned opportunities to date other women, preferring to spend time with his three boys instead. He is pictured here with Melanie and (left to right) Daniel, 13, Luke, 15, and Joe, 17 . However, their reconciliation was still far from a done deal. ‘Even after the holiday, things could have gone either way,’ Bishop said. ‘It was Relate that helped us. 'We were able to discuss what went wrong. It’s a British disease of building up barriers. I think that’s breaking down now and people are more open to the idea of counselling and talking things through. ‘That’s a really good thing. You’ll probably have half a dozen sessions and the penny will drop. And that can change the rest of your life. 'All of a sudden you realise things have been said but you couldn’t hear them.’ Bishop says that now he’s radically changed and is always honest about everything. On stage, he allows himself to be completely vulnerable. He has also become known for  his charity work. In 2012, he completed a 290-mile triathlon, raising a record £3.4 million for Sport Relief. However, Bishop says: ‘I’m still a long way from being perfect. I’ve learnt a lot about myself from writing my autobiography.’ His memoir – How Did All This Happen? – is extremely funny in parts and sad, raw and vulnerable in others. The book suggests Melanie has changed, too. Did having three children under five contribute to their break-up? ‘Yes, quite possibly that was going on,’ he says. ‘Sometimes people dismiss it by saying, “Oh, it’s post-natal depression. It’s a woman thing.” But you know what? It’s not. ‘Being under a degree of pressure all day can be very serious. ‘Looking after kids is the most important thing in society, it is the future, and it’s the one thing that you can never practise. 'There is never a lesson in school about how to be a good parent. You are just given the most important thing in the world and told to sort it out.’ Even family experience didn’t seem to help the young couple – John’s own father had four children by the time he was 24. ‘As I say in the book, on our estate in Runcorn, when we were growing up that was normal.’ But for John and Melanie, the experience of having children was overwhelming. When the marriage broke down, John says he was incredibly lonely. However, he did not play the field, preferring to spend time with his sons. ‘There was the odd girl I went out with. But no one ever met the kids and I never saw anyone on the weekend. Maybe over time that would have changed, but it didn’t for two years.’ So did he remain single because he always thought he would get back together with Melanie? ‘Possibly. But also I didn’t want any other call on my time apart from my kids. I didn’t want anyone saying “But why can’t I see you on Wednesday?” And I’d have to say, “Well, if I’ve got the boys I’ll have  to see if I can change it.” I just didn’t want any of that. ‘Melanie said there were some parts of the book that were harder to read than others and some that were uplifting. 'When I got into conversations with publishers and they said they wanted lots of funny stories I said, no, I’m writing a book about my life. 'I don’t regard it as more unusual than anyone else’s but what is unusual is I’ve been in a position where people asked me to write about it. ‘My life could only have happened if all of those things had happened. ‘The pain we had in our relationship – it sounds cliched – but it made us stronger.’","Father-of-three split from wife after long working hours took their toll .

"By . Richard Kay . and Geoffrey Levy . Happy together: Nigella with Phoebe, then eight, in 2004 . The decree nisi took a mere 70 seconds to be formally waved through the High Court, with neither party present. As for discussions over their assets, this took even less time, he keeping his £135 million fortune, she content with her own hard-earned £20 million. No wrangling, no demands. It may have been a ghastly, and very public episode over lunch two months ago, when Charles Saatchi was pictured with his left hand grasping his wife Nigella Lawson by the throat, but at least they have now gone their separate ways with good grace. Well, not quite. Privately, a very bitter war goes on. Even though he accepted a police caution for assault, Saatchi, 70, continues to insist to whoever will listen that the incident was nothing more than ‘a playful tiff . . . my actions were  not violent’. He is said to be seething that, after ten years of marriage, most of it happy, Nigella hasn’t uttered a single word in his defence. In fact, Nigella, 53, whose own lucrative television image as a flawless and desirable Domestic Goddess can hardly have been helped by her being seen as a victim of domestic violence, has, in all this time, said nothing publicly about the incident to anyone. ‘To talk about it would only make things worse for everyone,’ explains one close figure. ‘Better to say nothing, let it die away.’ For Nigella Lawson this is probably a sensible business strategy as she continues her assault on the huge American market, having conquered Britain. She is in Los Angeles making the second series of the ABC-networked reality cookery TV show The Taste, in which she both stars and is joint executive producer. ‘Her silence is torturing Charles,’ says one of his friends. ‘Surely she must realise this.’ Now, into this traumatic impasse, a new voice has suddenly, and quite unexpectedly, decided to speak out — Saatchi’s pretty 18-year-old daughter Phoebe. She was just seven when her father  married Nigella in 2003. Nigella was newly widowed after her first husband, journalist John Diamond, with whom Saatchi played Scrabble, died of cancer. She was left with their two children, Cosima and Bruno, who were aged eight and six. Gone: Nigella Lawson at Heathrow airport the night before her divorce case was heard at London's High Court . Phoebe is Saatchi’s only child, the daughter of his second marriage to American art expert Kay Hartenstein who — like his first wife, advertising executive Doris Lockhart — does not get a mention in his Who’s Who entry. Phoebe, who has just left school and is going to university, has grown up living mostly with her father and Nigella, and her step-brother and sister to whom she is close. In recent times, they have all been together at their £14 million house in Chelsea, West London. Thus far, the three children have been kept well out of this domestic tragedy. But yesterday, Saatchi brought Phoebe to the telephone in Italy, where they are on holiday, for her to read out a brief statement that she volunteered to the Mail. With her voice trembling slightly, she said: ‘The statement is: “Nigella has not spoken to me since she left our house on that Sunday when the newspaper story appeared. She has behaved in a very cold-hearted way. She has been my mother since I was seven or eight and has just abandoned me.” That’s it.’ Silence: Nigella has said nothing since the pictures of Charles Saatchi grabbing her by the throat appeared in a Sunday newspaper . This was an extraordinary intervention by the very last person one would have expected to put herself at the centre of this saga. So just what drove Phoebe to publicly condemn her stepmother so intensely? She would go no further. Politely, after reading out the statement, she said she ‘cannot answer any questions, I’m really sorry’. Friends of Nigella, however, claim that Saatchi is using his daughter — or at least encouraging her — to attack her stepmother. ‘The divorce is really sad for the children but Charles should have known better than to let Phoebe get involved in such a grimy situation,’ says one close observer. But a family friend of Saatchi says that it was entirely Phoebe’s own idea to speak out. ‘She’s completely devastated that she hasn’t had a phone call from Nigella,’ says the friend. ‘Whatever issues Nigella has with Charles, she doesn’t have them with Phoebe. ‘And on top of this, Phoebe is furious with Nigella for not saying anything to defend her father and just leaving him to hang out to dry.’ It should be said that Nigella has not been entirely out of touch with Phoebe. A month after the infamously photographed incident at Scott’s restaurant in Mayfair, by which time Nigella had returned to America to continue filming her television show, it was reported in a Sunday newspaper that she had invited Phoebe to join her and Cosima and Bruno at the house she was renting in Los Angeles. The invitation came in a text message. Phoebe did not accept it. Instead, according to a family friend: ‘When Phoebe saw an item about the invitation in a newspaper, she felt she was being used. She texted Nigella to say she didn’t want to be part of her publicity machine.’ Nigella replied that it was nothing to do with her. ‘The trouble is, Phoebe misses her so much,’ says the friend. ‘She was like a second mother to her, though she didn’t call her “Mummy” as she has her own mother. It was “Nigella” or “Nige”, and sometimes even “Darling”. ‘And, of course, Phoebe misses her step-brother and sister, too. She just finds it inconceivable that Nigella hasn’t been in touch on the phone. She feels very let down.’ For her part, through her public relations adviser Mark Hutchinson, Nigella declines to respond to Phoebe’s charge of ‘abandoning’ her. Given a copy of Phoebe’s statement, Hutchinson replied half an hour later: ‘We continue not to comment on personal matters.’ Public spat: Nigella moved out of the family home as soon as the furore of the choking photos began . Understandable, perhaps, because Nigella is said to be anxious about being drawn into an emotional telephone conversation which is bound to be upsetting on both sides. No one doubts that Phoebe has been very close to her stepmother for most of Nigella’s marriage to Saatchi, and misses her. Friends do say, however, this closeness had changed a little in the past year. ‘Nigella seemed to be a bit distracted at times,’ says a Saatchi friend. ‘We put it down to her ambition to become a superstar, you know, to conquer America and become the transatlantic goddess. She’s certainly worked very hard at it and deserves success.’ As for her ‘abandoning’ Phoebe, it is only fair to point out that Saatchi himself has said that he invited Nigella to ‘pack your bags and go’ when they argued on the day the pictures of him grabbing her throat were published. She stormed off that afternoon with a few belongings and moved into a rented flat. Her friends still say, of course, that she had been willing — right up to the end — to give the marriage another chance. His friends, though, say she used the restaurant incident as the perfect excuse to get away from him. To cap all this confusion, Saatchi, who slapped in a divorce action long before the dust had had much time to settle, is now telling friends that he didn’t really want the marriage to end. Denial: Privately, Charles Saatchi continues to insist that the incident at Scott's was a playful tiff . But he says: ‘However disappointed Nigella may have been with me as a husband, I’m heartbroken that Phoebe has been totally abandoned in this way.’ This is, of course, a classic example of how children, of any age, can be deeply wounded by warring parents. As always, it is difficult, and dangerous, for outsiders to make judgments. After all, for many years they were one of the capital’s most glittering and fashionable couples. They seemed completely contented in each other’s company, enviously at ease with each other’s foibles, the age difference of 17 years an insignificant detail in their lives. Saatchi, always good at one-liners, liked to chaff his pneumatic wife with observations such as: ‘She’s too good for me, I know, but she knows it, too, and reminds me every day.’ Nigella, famous for her curves, would say that this was how Charles liked her to be: ‘He would be very dismayed if I suddenly turned into a lean, mean, fighting machine.’ Intriguingly, in recent months that is just what she did. ‘I just got thinner,’ she told an American television audience. She blamed it on having foot trouble which left her unable to walk to the fridge to help herself to cake and other favourites. But she has also admitted having hypnotherapy to help her lose weight. There is one other puzzle. About a year ago, in an interview, Nigella described herself as: ‘Very, very conflict averse . . . I go a bit ice maiden. I withdraw.’ Yet she certainly had not withdrawn six days after the ‘choking’ incident, because Charles and Nigella were back at Scott’s, having dinner with a group of friends.

So much so, it has been rumoured that a hefty $25,000 is being paid each week for Network Ten's reality dating series The Bachelor. The waterfront estate named Clifton located in Hunters Hill - Sydney's affluent north shore, has been owned by the McCaffrey family since 1993 when they bought it for $2.75 million, reported the Property Observer.

Although the official payment figure from production company Shine Australia has not been confirmed, it was reported that the ritzy estate was available for rent for $1,500 a week. Before the show aired, Channel Ten uploaded a series of pictures to The Bachelor Australia's Facebook page revealing the stunning 120-year-old property expands over 5,124 square metres - just as lavish as last year's set at Bayview's La Joie de Vivre in Sydney's northern beaches.

"By . Daniel Martin . Voters prefer the Tories to run the economy whether or not they believe it is recovering, a poll has found. Lord Ashcroft, the former Conservative deputy chairman, conducted the survey to test the idea that Britons might think differently about who they want in charge depending on the state of the economy. But – in a blow for Ed Miliband and Ed Balls – voters still much prefer the Tories, regardless of whether they are told the economy is getting better or getting worse. The Lord Ashcroft survey found that when the economy is in trouble, 45 per cent of voters including 20 per cent of Labour supporters, back Cameron and Osborne . With the recession over and the economy now recovering, 48 per cent trust the Tories to best manage the economy, compared to just 29 per cent who back Miliband and Balls . The poll asked whether people most trusted David Cameron and George Osborne or the Labour pair. The sample was split, with half asked whom they most trusted ‘with our economy facing serious problems and challenges in the months ahead’; the other half, whom they preferred ‘now that the recession is over and the economy is recovering’. Some have suggested that people might prefer the Tories when thinking about the tough decisions needed, or when reminded of the good economic news that was starting to come through. On the other hand, they might be more inclined to go back to Labour if they felt the hard economic work had now been done and less was at stake. Trusted on the economy: David Cameron, left, and George Osborne, came ahead of the Labour leaders for economic competence regardless of whether the economy was in a poor or good state, a poll said . Far behind: Ed Miliband, left, and Ed Balls, right, came either 17 or 19 points behind the Tories, depending on the question . In fact, the framing of the question made very little difference. The question indicating the economy was still in dire straits saw the Tory pair take a 17-point lead (45 per cent to 28 per cent); while the more positive question led to a 19-point lead (48 per cent to 29 per cent). Worryingly for Mr Miliband, more than 20 per cent of Labour voters prefer Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne. Lord Ashcroft said: ‘This is clearly disturbing for Labour.’","45% want Cameron and Osborne in charge when economy is in trouble .

"By . Daniel Martin . Promises: Labour welfare spokesman Rachel Reeves will vow to raise the minimum wage, introduce Living Wage contracts and build homes . Labour will today hit out at the ballooning cost of housing benefit for working families – despite opposing all attempts by the Coalition to cut the bill. Shadow minister Rachel Reeves will unveil analysis showing that the number of employed people claiming the hand-out is set to double from 2010 to 2018. The extra cost during these years will be £12.9billion or £488 for each household in Britain, she will claim. In a speech at Pudsey, West Yorkshire, Miss Reeves will say it is wrong that a benefit meant for the poorest is increasingly propping up the income of low-paid workers. She will also condemn the Tory record on welfare as one of ‘failure and waste’. Labour promises to cut the housing benefit bill by raising the minimum wage and encouraging firms to pay the so-called living wage. The welfare spokeswoman will say: ‘The number of working people claiming housing benefit is set to double because the Tory Government has failed to tackle low pay, insecure work and the cost-of-living crisis. ‘That’s meant thousands more people have been forced to rely on housing benefit to make ends meet. 'Labour will raise the minimum wage, introduce Living Wage contracts and get 200,000 homes built a year by 2020 to tackle the housing benefit bill and ensure working people can make ends meet.’ Miss Reeves will also say that Mr Duncan Smith has wasted huge amounts with his flagship Universal Credit welfare reforms. She called for a three month pause while the National Audit Office investigates it. ‘Iain Duncan Smith promised a million people would be on Universal Credit by April 2014,’ she said. ‘But the latest figures show less than 6,000 people are claiming. ‘At the current rate of progress it would take a staggering 1,222 years for Universal Credit to be rolled out across the country.’ She will add: ‘Next May there is a big choice for the British people on social security. ‘A Tory economy based on low wages, failing programmes, waste and rising costs, or a Labour future with reforms to make work pay, tackle waste and reward people who do the right thing to get social security spending under control. That’s The Choice.’ Waste: The welfare reforms brought in by Iain Duncan Smith, left, should be paused, Miss Reeves said. But Welfare Minister Mark Harper, right, blamed Labour for leaving the Coalition with a 'culture of dependency' A Conservative source said the level of housing benefit for working people began to rise under Labour – not under the Coalition. Welfare minister Mark Harper said: ‘We inherited an out-of-control housing benefit system from Labour that created a culture of dependency. Their system saw some people claiming £104,000 a year of hardworking taxpayers’ money to live in expensive areas. ‘We’ve capped benefits so no family can claim more than the average family gets by going out to work and we’ve put an end to unlimited housing benefit. This is all part of our-long-term economic plan to build a welfare system that provides a safety net for those in need, while rewarding the willingness to work. ‘But Labour haven’t learnt their lesson. They voted against our housing benefit cap, they voted against our overall cap on benefits and they still plan to borrow and spend more by restoring the spare room subsidy – landing future generations with more debt than they can ever hope to repay.’","Workers claiming housing benefit is set to double by 2018, says Labour .

"By . Daniel Martin, Whitehall Correspondent . The public has lost faith in government claims about tackling immigration because it does not tally with what they see on the ground, Nick Clegg will admit. In a speech on immigration tomorrow, the Deputy Prime Minister will say it is ‘no wonder’ that people do not believe what ministers tell them when they have been ‘repeatedly told one thing only to then see another’. He will speak out in favour of the free movement of European citizens but seek reforms to ensure that fewer Eastern Europeans move here if more countries are admitted to the EU in future. Speaking out: In a speech on immigration, Nick Clegg (left) will back the seek reforms to the free movement of European citizens to ensure that fewer Eastern Europeans move here if more countries are admitted to the EU in future, while Rachel Reeves (right) will also call for reforms to tackle benefit tourism . Labour’s welfare spokesman Rachel Reeves will also call for reforms to the freedom of movement – to tackle benefit tourism – in a speech tomorrow. But the Tories claim her idea – to stop people being able to claim welfare unless they have built up sufficient National Insurance contributions – was likely to be illegal under EU law. The two speeches on immigration from Labour and Lib Dem politicians indicate that both believe they need to speak tough on the issue in the run-up to next May’s general election. On Saturday, Labour’s Ed Balls said the party could not win the election unless it became tougher on immigration. The surge by Ukip – which stands on an . anti-immigration platform – in May’s European elections particularly . unnerved the Lib Dems, who were reduced to one seat. To tackle this . perception, Mr Clegg will say tomorrow that more needs to be done on . migration from Europe. Arrivals: Passengers check in for a flight from Bucharest, Romania, to London, on January 1 this year when transition controls were lifted . ‘I want to be unequivocal: freedom of movement between EU member states is a good thing,’ he will say. ‘It’s a cornerstone of European integration; a right enjoyed by around one and a half million British citizens who live on the other side of the Channel. ‘It is necessary in order to be part of the world’s biggest single market where goods and people can flow between nations. ‘Those who wish to undo it should be careful what they wish for: the blow to UK prosperity would be immense.’ But he said freedom of movement needed reform to make it clear it was a freedom to work, not a freedom to claim benefits. He said that, if the EU expands in future, there need to be tougher transitional controls so that fewer people from poorer countries can come here in search of work. Mr Clegg will say: ‘In 2004 Labour said up to 13,000 people from countries like Poland and Hungary would come here every year. The real figure was around 170,000. ‘When Romania and Bulgaria joined, Labour said no one from those countries would arrive ahead of the transition controls being lifted this year. Yet 60,000 Romanians and Bulgarians were already working here through a loophole for anyone who registered as self-employed. ‘Is it any wonder – when people have been repeatedly told one thing only to then see another – that so many have lost faith in government’s ability to manage the flow of migrants from new EU states?’ Get tough: Boris Johnson will warn David Cameron that Brussels will only give him a better deal if he threatens to pull Britain out of the EU . Boris Johnson will throw down the gauntlet to David Cameron this week – by warning that Brussels will only give him a better deal if he threatens to pull Britain out of the EU. A study by the London Mayor’s economic adviser, banker Gerard Lyons, says leaving the EU is ‘definitely a viable option’ and would be better for Britain than staying in an unreformed institution. Mr Johnson will use the findings in a speech in which he is expected to say that the UK should ‘not be frightened’ of leaving the EU – a stark contrast to the position of the Prime Minister, who wants Britain to stay in. Mr Cameron has pledged a referendum on EU membership by 2017, following Brussels reforms, including a crackdown on benefit tourism. But Mr Johnson is understood to believe that the strategy will not ensure success. A source close to the mayor told The Sunday Times that he believes Mr Cameron must be ‘bold’ in his demands in the renegotiation of membership and the best way is by showing he has ‘no fear’ of departure if the talks fail to deliver.","Deputy Prime Minister due to give a speech on immigration tomorrow .

"By . Gemma Mullin . Drivers had to take a second look when they spotted a goat travelling in the back seat of a car on a busy A-road. The high-speed animal was spotted in the back seat of a red Volkswagen Golf on the busy A55 outside Chester. The goat, which might have been more at home in a farmyard, was clearly visible in the back of the vehicle in the evening sunshine. The goat is seen in the back of the red Volkswagen Golf, which was travelling along the A55 towards Chester . It seemed calm while its driver travelled at 60mph - sitting quite still in the back seat and staring out of the window. The unusual sighting was captured by Chris Cousens, 29, from Hoole, Chester, at about 7pm on Wednesday. ‘You are used to seeing dogs in the back of cars but I’ve never seen a goat before,’ he said. ‘I had to look twice just to make sure my eyes weren’t playing tricks on me.’ The car turned off towards Chester city centre but its destination remains a mystery. A Cheshire Police spokesman said the force was not aware of any reports relating to the incident but would advice drivers to take care when driving with animals in their cars. He said: 'While it is not technically illegal to have a goat in the back of your car, you need to ensure that it is not going to be a distraction to you whilst you are driving. 'Any animal which causes you to lose control or drive erratically can lead to you being charged with a road traffic offence. 'It doesn’t matter whether it is a cat, dog, goat or lama.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A company has launched a fitness band for children as young as four which measures how much exercise they do. Its makers claim it is a useful tool to encourage youngsters to play and develop healthy habits as parents track their activity. But it has had a less than positive reception from parents, who said that children should get out in the real world and play rather than ‘burying their heads in technology’. The LeapBand, resembles a watch with a small screen and a virtual pet which is given rewards . The band, which goes on sale today costs £29.99 and is designed for children aged four to seven . TheLeapBand, which resembles a watch, has a small screen with a virtual pet which is given rewards, including healthy snacks, if children complete a certain amount of exercise. The band, which goes on sale today costs £29.99 and is designed for children aged four to seven. Its makers claim that the device, which offers 50 different activities and challenges, monitors a child’s physical movements and awards them points for being active. These points can then be translated into games and rewards, including ‘healthy snacks’, for a choice of eight virtual pets, which they can personalise. The pet idea is similar to the Tamagotchi, a digital pet which can be named, fed and watered by its owners, and became a hit in Britain after originating in Japan. On the website, the band’s makers, LeapFrog, write: ‘Discover the only activity tracker just for kids that encourages active play and healthy habits with a customisable pet pal.’ Parents can download games for the band, which is being promoted by athletes Greg Rutherford and Beth Tweddle. But the idea was criticised by parents who argued that children should be outside playing rather than using technology to take exercise. The LeapBand is being promoted by athletes Greg Rutherford (right) and Beth Tweddle (left) Richard Jones wrote: ‘Just as they are about to look up to the beautiful world around them we encourage them to bury their heads onto some joyless app in the name of technology. Not for my kids.’ Mestizo wrote: ‘I’d say you’ve pretty much failed as a parent at the point you’re thinking your 4 year old needs a pedometer. And kids will get bored of it in minutes, as is the case with all worthy toys.’ Bluetwo wrote: ‘Just the thing for stupid fat lazy parents who won’t play with their kids. You want to get the children [out of] the lounge? Take an interest in their lives. That may mean getting fat lazy parents out of the house as well - will they need a toy watch for that?’ But ExpatMum wrote on the Guardian website: ‘That might not be a bad idea! My youngest has no interest whatsoever in sports and doesn’t do anything beyond PE lessons at school, (although we take the dog for long walks). ‘He’s too old for this but it’s given me the idea of getting him something like it to perhaps jog his interest in moving about more!’ Child obesity campaigners added that children should never be rewarded with food for completing exercises. Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, which campaigns on childhood obesity, although welcoming the idea, said food should never be a reward for exercise. The pet idea is similar to the Tamagotchi, a digital pet which can be named, fed and watered by its owners, and became a hit in Britain after originating in Japan . ‘The idea is positive, as long as the reward for exercise is not food and parents are sensible. We need to keep our children active and we all know that they are notoriously difficult to get off the sofa,’ he said. ‘Parent’s aren’t aware of how much activity their children do and if this helps parents, then great. Ultimately, they’ll decide whether this works. ‘The really tragic thing is that the activities are being rewarded by food. Often, these supposedly healthy snacks are full of sugar. ‘Children should never be rewarded with food however healthy they say the snacks are.’ The makers of the LeapBand also released research which suggests that parents aren’t sure of the best way to keep their children healthy due to confusing messages about health. The survey also suggested that despite a summer of sports competitions, like the Commonwealth Games and World Cup, 10 per cent of children would rather watch sport on television than play it. Of the 1,000 parents questioned, 38 per cent with children aged four to seven were confused about the best way to keep their child fit and healthy due to confusing and mixed health messages. Almost a fifth of parents did not know that the Government recommended daily amount of physical activity for children five years and older is 60 minutes per day, it also found. The average parent spends less than two hours a week playing physically active games and sports with their child, with a quarter admitting they just do not have time to make active plans for their children, it showed. And despite a summer of sport on television, a third of children have shown no interest in sporting events this year.","LeapBand designed for children over four measures how much they exercise .

"By . Jennifer Newton . A rescue cat looks set to be crowned the world's oldest feline after her owners found proof she is a staggering 28-years-old. Pinky who was born in July 1986, which makes her 129 in human years, was taken in by her owners Ann and Bob Higginbottom as a four-month-old kitten and she has lived with the couple ever since in Dunston, Lincolnshire. The pair have documentation of early visits to vets, which prove that at 28-years-old Pinky could be officially the world's oldest cat. Pinky, who is celebrating her 28th birthday, which could make her the world's oldest cat poses next to her birthday cake . The Guinness Book of Records has a cat from Bournemouth called Poppy, listed as the world's oldest, but she died earlier this month aged 24 meaning Pinky could take the crown. Pinky and her brother Perky, who died 10 years ago, were rescued by Bob and Ann after being born on a farm and taken to an RSPCA rehoming centre. This was at a time when Top Gun was wowing cinema audiences, Margaret Thatcher was prime minister and Madonna was top of the charts. But these days Pinky now spends her time in the warmth of the couple's greenhouse at their new bungalow or sunning herself as she watches their ornamental Koi. Today retired caterer Mrs Higginbottom said that Pinky was now completely deaf and 'turning into an old lady'. Her owner, Ann Higginbottom of Dunston in Lincolnshire took in Pinky and her brother Perky, when they were just four-month-old kittens . The 73-year-old explained: 'We got her and Perky when they were just four months old. 'She is amazing really, completely deaf now as is to be expected, but her eyesight is still as sharp as ever. 'She is turning into an old lady now, she likes to sit by our Koi pond and just watch them as they swim about. 'She isn't interested in catching them any more, just likes to watch them. 'When we first got them they chose to live in the barn when we lived at the manor house. Mrs Higginbottom says she has proof of Pinky's age as she kept certificates from vets, showing when the cat had vaccinations . 'It was up to them, I imagine it was because they came from a farm and where used to living out there. 'Now she spends her time out in the greenhouse. 'She comes in and likes to be petted but that's just where she likes to be. She does not like being picked up, but nor do many cats.' The oldest cat ever, according to Guinness World Records, died in Texas, USA, in August 2005 at the age of 38 years. Mrs Higginbottom said that she and her husband were now looking to approach Guinness World Records with Pinky's certificates . Other cats have laid claim to the title, but their owners don't have any documentation to prove their pet is the oldest feline. Mrs Higginbottom said that she and retired quantity surveyor Mr Higginbottom, 87, were now looking to approach Guinness World Records with Pinky's certificates. She added: 'It would be incredible for Pinky to be recognised as the world's oldest cat and as far as we can see there is nothing stopping her being crowned that.'","Pinky was born in July 1986 and at 28 could officially be world's oldest cat .

According to the Met Office some parts of England and Wales saw 10 to 15 mm of rain in an hour, leading to localised flooding with places in Hampshire seeing 20mm of rainfall in just 60 minutes. Heavy rain also affected the north-east of England and forced the accident and emergency department at South Tyneside District Hospital in South Shields to partially close due to flooding. Steve Williamson, South Tyneside NHS Foundation Trust’s chief operating officer, said: 'As a result of extremely heavy rain earlier today, flooding has affected parts of the South Tyneside District Hospital site. The north-east of England was also affected with heavy rain and flooding as the storm clouds gathered over St Mary's Lighthouse in Northumberland earlier today . People attending the Great Yorkshire Agricultural Show in Harrogate had to find cover wherever they could as rain affected the first day of the week long event . Despite the torrential downpours today, the Met Office say the rain will clear later on this evening, with many enjoying a warm and sunny day tomorrow . Organisers of the Great Yorkshire Show in Harrogate will be hoping for better weather tomorrow after the heavens opened . 'The majority of our patient services, including some operations and outpatients appointments, are going ahead as planned. 'However, we would request at this stage that patients avoid attending our A&E department and, where possible, find an alternative by going to another hospital A&E or a local minor injuries unit until further notice. 'Their co-operation would be much appreciated.' The rain also caused disruption on the roads and the Tyne and Wear Metro and Northumbria Police added: 'We have received reports of localised flooding on some roads and motorists are being advised to take care on roads; drive safely and watch out for standing water. 'Drivers are urged to allow extra travel time, moderate their speed, use their lights appropriately and drive according to the conditions.' But despite the heavy rain elsewhere in the country, Brighton was enjoying warm and sunny weather with sunseekers taking to Brighton beach . Forecasters believe that much of the country will experience warm and sunny weather like in Brighton today as the rain clears . The south coast in places such as Brighton, pictured, are expecting to see temperatures reach record highs in the next few weeks . One sunseeker prepares to cool off with a refreshing swim in Brighton, where there was warm, sunny weather today . However, forecasters expect the worst of the rain to clear tonight, leaving many to experience a dry and warm day tomorrow. Emma Sharples from the Met Office said: 'Tomorrow looks dry for much of the country with the showers on their way out. 'It will be fairly sunny and warm with the exception of the east coast, where it will become quite windy. 'The best of the sunshine will be in the south west of England, central southern England and across much of Scotland. 'It will become warm and humid as the week goes on, which will lead to some thundery downpours to develop with the outlook looking unsettled going into the weekend.'","Heavy downpours have been affecting several parts of the country causing flash flooding in Bournemouth .

"By . Jennifer Newton . She may now be the Queen of Spain but new pictures of Queen Letizia show she was just like any other student during her university days, taking odd jobs to make ends meet. Letizia first studied journalism at university in Madrid before taking a masters course at a university in Mexico, where these new pictures reveal she took a job as a hostess promoting a tobacco brand. The images were taken in the mid-90s while the Queen studied at the University of Guadalajara in Mexico. Scroll down for video . New pictures have emerged showing Queen Letizia of Spain during her time studying in Mexico where she took a job promoting a cigarette brand . Letizia can be seen offering information about the Boots tobacco brand and handing out cigarettes to congress visitors . Known as just Letizia Ortiz Rocasolano at the time, the wife of King Felipe VI can be seen in a shirt bearing the name of the 'Boots' brand of tobacco, along with jeans and a red scarf. The pictures show Letizia smiling as she goes around offering information about the brand and giving out 'Boots' cigarettes to congress visitors to earn some extra cash. It makes a stark change from today, where Letizia and her husband were on a two-day visit to Morocco on their third foreign visit since he recently became king. The wife of King Felipe VI can be seen in a shirt bearing the name of the 'Boots' brand of tobacco, along with jeans and a red scarf . The royal couple were in Rabat, where they visited the Mausoleum of King Mohammed V. Letizia studied in Mexico after completing a course in journalism in the early 1990s at the University Complutense of Madrid. After spending time studying in Mexico in the mid-90s, she eventually returned to Spain, where before meeting Prince Felipe, she worked as a newsreader for CNN. She later went on to become the main anchor on Spain's TVE news programme, which led her to meeting her future husband. Today Queen Letizia was on a royal visit to Morocco where she was dressed in an elegant white trouser suit and head scarf . The royal couple were on their third foreign visit since King Juan Carlos abdicated and visited the mausoleum of Mohammed V in Rabat, Morocco . Letizia gave up her high-flying journalism career on marrying Prince Felipe and have two daughters Leonor and Sofia . Queen Letizia signs the golden book in the mausoleum of Mohammed V while on a visit to Morocco today . They got engaged in 2003 and married in 2004 at Cathedral Santa María la Real de la Almudena in Madrid. Letizia gave up her high-flying career on marrying Prince Felipe. The couple has since had two children, Infanta Leonor de Todos los Santos of Spain, born 31 October 2005 - who is next in line - and Infanta Sofía de Todos los Santos of Spain, born 29 April 2007. In June, King Juan Carlos I announced his abdication as king of Spain, handing over the crown to his oldest son Felipe and Letizia, who was once married before and is often described as the 'Spanish Kate Middleton'.","Pictures show Queen Letizia while she was a student at university in Mexico .

"By . Jennifer Newton . The house in Kensington where Mayir Naturbhai Patel illegally extended his home . A man who extended his £2.8million home in one of Kensington's most exclusive streets without planning planning permission has been fined £40,000. Mayur Naturbhai Patel admitted breaching the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 after he made major rooftop alterations to his property without permission and did not comply with a council enforcement notice requiring them to be removed. The extension made room for a new staircase and an ensuite bedroom and could have added hundreds of thousands of pounds to the four-storey property. Sentencing was referred to Isleworth Crown Court as it has the power to deal with a proceeds of crime action instigated by the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. The authority wanted to prevent Patel, 54, from profiting financially from the additional floor space created by his illegal development. He was fined £15,000 and also had £23,350 confiscated under the Proceeds of Crime Act and was warned the faced 15 months in prison if he fails to pay the confiscation order in three months. In his closing remarks His Honour Judge Phillip Matthews said he did not ascribe shady motives when imposing the financial penalty, but thought Patel had acted with the 'utmost stupidity' and that it was no mitigation to say he relied on the advice of architects. Neighbours complained to the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea after work began to build the extension . At his original hearing on last month, magistrates heard how Patel failed to comply with a planning enforcement notice served by the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea in November 2012. Enforcement officers issued the notice following complaints that major work was underway. One of Mr Patel's neighbours, Aaron Jessop, told the Evening Standard: 'It is as if it . happened overnight. Scaffolding was erected, screening went up to hide . the work and suddenly this thing started to grow up.' On inspection they discovered that the roof had been altered and that a large roof extension and a rear roof had been constructed, all of which is unauthorised development harming the appearance of the Norland Conservation Area where the property stands . Neighbour Aaron Jessop, pictured, said that scaffolding was erected and screening went up to hide the work . Despite the four months allowed under the notice to restore the property, and a number of reminders, most of the work required remains outstanding, but still needs to be undertaken to avoid potential further action by the council. In his defence Mr Patel claimed to have received verbal confirmation from his architect and a planning officer that the alterations would be acceptable. Councillor Timothy Coleridge, cabinet member for planning policy, said: 'I am very pleased that the court has made this ruling. 'We were determined that Mr Patel should not gain financially from his illegal development.'","Mayur Naturbhai Patel admitted he made rooftop alterations without consent .

"By . Jennifer Newton . The commissioner of the Metropolitan Police has today apologised to the family of a woman whose shooting sparked the 1985 Brixton riots after an inquest revealed failures by officers. Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe made the apology to the family of Dorothy Groce, known as Cherry, who was shot by police during a bungled raid at her home. Mrs Groce was paralysed from the chest down following the shooting by armed police, who were searching for her son. Cherry Groce, pictured in 1986, who was paralysed from the chest down after being shot during a bungled police raid on her home, which sparked the 1985 Brixton riots . She died 26 years later in 2011 from kidney failure, which a pathologist directly linked to the gunshot wound. An inquest jury today said the raid by Metropolitan Police and Hertfordshire Police should never have gone ahead, one of eight police failures which they found contributed to her death. In a statement Sir Bernard said: 'Today, I apologise unreservedly for our failings. I also apologise for the inexcusable fact that it has taken until now, for the Met to make this public apology. 'Sadly, this means that the person who most deserved to hear the apology, those words ‘we are sorry’, is no longer here. 'However, Cherry’s children, her friends and others are here and they too deserve an apology. I am sorry for the years of suffering which our actions and omissions caused to your family.' Armed police accidentally shot Mrs Groce, pictured in 1985 recovering in St Thomas' Hospital, after they raided her home searching for her son . The Commissioner also described the operation which saw Mrs Groce shot as 'inadequate in both its planning and delivery' and the shooting itself as 'preventable'. He added: 'Mrs Groce bore her suffering with dignity and her story is a powerful reminder to all officers of our responsibilities when we use force, or plan for its possible use. 'What is clear is that in this case, we, as an organisation, failed to meet those responsibilities and in doing so caused irreparable damage to a mother and her family.' Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, who today apologised for police failings after a jury found the raid should never have gone ahead . Earlier Mrs Groce’s family had said they were expecting an apology from the Metropolitan Police and would 'listen to with interest'. Her son Lawrence Lee said his family had finally won their 29 year fight for the truth, which included a campaign for legal aid in order to be fairly represented at the inquest and the release of a police report in to the raid. Mr Lee, who witnessed the shooting when he was just 11 years old, said: 'I always knew what happened that day was wrong and now I feel like we finally have heard the truth. 'This inquest has been the first opportunity in 29 years for us to hear about the serious failings made by police. 'It’s been very emotional and frustrating, it’s been a fight and battle for my mum her whole life and we’ve carried that fight on. 'I really hope that the police learn valuable lessons in terms of accountability and transparency. 'If they can’t hold their hands up to a historical failure, what hope do we have?' He also described his mother as a 'care free, happy-go-lucky type of person' before she was paralysed, and said she had remained the boss of the house and centre of the family afterwards. 'She is the real hero in all of this,' he added. At an inquest into her death, it was found that the failings by police included poor communication, which led officers to brief those carrying out the raid with out-of-date details . They were not given 'adequate information' that Mr Groce was no longer wanted by police or that he was no longer in possession of a shotgun. Police also failed to adequately check who lived at the property, including women and children, or to carry out the correct observations on the house. Mrs Groce's shooting sparked riots in Brixton in 1985, with protestors throwing petrol bombs at police . The jury concluded: 'Dorothy Groce was shot by police during a planned surprise, forced entry raid at her home and her subsequent death was contributed to by failures in the planning and implementation of the raid.' Coroner Lorna Tagliavini said she would not be making any recommendations to the police forces because policing has drastically changed over the past 29 years. Mrs Groce’s shooting by Metropolitan Police Inspector Douglas Lovelock sparked two days of unrest during which shops were looted and petrol bombs thrown in the south London neighbourhood of Brixton. Mr Lovelock stood trial in 1987 charged with inflicting unlawful and malicious grievous bodily harm and was acquitted. Meanwhile, Mrs Groce spent nearly three decades in a wheelchair and susceptible to debilitating illness. The riots also saw cars set alight and saw dozens of civilians and police officers wounded during clashes . The jury returned their verdict on the third day of deliberations following six days of evidence. Chuka Umunna, MP for Streatham, had also called for the police force to apologise to the family, after the family was 'completely vindicated' by the jury’s findings. He explained: 'It is a disgrace that my constituents - all innocent victims of a grave injustice - have had to wait almost three decades to get to the bottom of what happened that fateful day in 1985 when their mother was shot by the Metropolitan Police. 'That Cherry Groce never lived to hear the jury’s findings today compounds the injustice my constituents feel. 'The findings of the jury are very welcome and resounding.'","Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe apologises for failings to family of Cherry Groce .

"By . Julian Robinson . and Jennifer Newton . and Andrew Levy . Tomas Kanaporis has come forward to claim that the mystery man, pictured, is his missing brother Alvydas . A Lithuanian has claimed that a man found two months ago wandering alone in a park suffering severe amnesia is his missing brother. The mystery man, named Robert by hospital staff, was found in a park in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire unable to remember anything about himself. But last night, Lithuanian Tomas Kanaporis came forward to claim that he was his 22-year-old brother Alvydas. He told media in his home country that his sibling was a media technology graduate who came to Britain after his ad company closed. According to The Sun, Tomas Kanaporis told reporters in Lithuania that he lost contact with his brother in May. He said: 'It is almost like he didn't have a family.' The newspaper also reports that karate coach Gediminas Tankevicius has named and identified Alvydas as one of his former students. Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust are understood to have received calls from abroad about the patient and investigations are continuing in a bid to identify him formally. Staff at the hospital where he is being cared for have called him Robert, but say his memory has not improved since he was found on May 18. He is thought to be in his twenties, and is an accomplished basketball player. He speaks English with an eastern European accent and understands some Russian and Lithuanian. Dr Manaan Kar Ray, the clinical director of acute care at Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust who has been monitoring Robert, said such extreme amnesia usually only lasted a few hours and was typically caused by a traumatic event ‘such as torture or a natural disaster’. He added: ‘I have been a psychiatrist for 15 years and I have never seen anything like this. 'It’s like something out of the movies. ‘There are very few clues for us to go on. 'The only thing we know is that he does have an interest in playing sports. We asked him if he liked basketball and he said he didn’t know what that was. 'But when we took him to play with other people he picked up the ball and knew exactly what to do.’ Robert said: ‘The last few weeks have . been truly horrible. I go through so many emotions. At times I am angry, . frustrated, depressed, lost and confused. The man named 'Robert' by hospital staff was found in a park near a bus station in Peterborough on May 18 and is currently being treated at the Cavell Centre at Peterborough City Hospital . Experts believe he may be Eastern European and say he appears to have a talent for basketball and could be a football fan as he was wearing a Champions League watch when found . ‘I just need to find out my name and I hope someone out there will recognise me and help.’ Robert, . who is 5ft 9in, weighs 13 stone and has dark hair and blue eyes, was . not carrying a mobile phone or any identifying documents when he was . found in a confused state. In . 2005, an accomplished musician who became known as the Piano Man was . found wandering in Kent. He remained mute for four months in hospital . but was accused of being a hoaxer after remembering he was Andreas . Grassl, a 20-year-old German. Robert is currently at the Cavell Centre at Peterborough City Hospital, where experts are trying to help him regain his memory. But nearly two months since he was found there has been no improvement in his condition. However, Robert’s doctors say they have one clue to help him remember his lost life - his apparent talent for basketball. Medics asked the mystery man if he liked the sport but he said he had never heard of it. But when Robert was thrown a basketball he knew exactly what to do and ran rings around the competition. He has also been playing football and tennis with fellow patients at a mental health unit on the outskirts of Peterborough. Doctors believe Robert is also a football fan because he was wearing a Champions League watch when he was picked up by police. Consultant pyschiatrist Dr Mannan Kar Ray, left, is treating Robert and says he has never seen an amnesia case as severe as this . But he has not watched a single World Cup match and has no idea which team he supports. Dr Kar-Ray added: 'There are very few clues for us to go on. 'When he was found he was wearing a watch with Champions League written on it, so that would suggest he is a football fan. But he hasn’t watched any of the World Cup and he has no idea what team he supports. 'The only thing we know is that he does have an interest in playing sports. 'We have taken him into Peterborough town centre to see if that triggers anything, but with no success. 'We’ve also taken him to Eastern European groups but no one recognises him. 'At the moment we are drawing a complete blank.' Cambridgeshire Police say the man is not known to police and does not match any missing persons reports.","Lithuanian says unconscious man found in Peterborough park is his brother .

"By . Jennifer Newton . and Daily Mail Reporter . Veteran DJ Tony Blackburn, who claims that listeners prefer to hear men's voices on the radio . Veteran DJ Tony Blackburn has claimed listeners prefer to hear male voices on the radio and that there are too too many women in presenting slots. His comments come after earlier this week it was announced BBC Radio 5 Live were to replace long-time presenters Victoria Derbyshire and Shelagh Fogarty, while Adrian Chiles, Peter Allen and Dan Walker were to join. This is despite the BBC Trust warning the station two years ago that it must do more to attract a ‘more even balance’ of listeners but only one hour a week at 5 Live will now be solely anchored by a woman. But the 71-year-old broadcaster defended the BBC's decision saying he believes there are 'quite a lot of women' on the radio. He told the Daily Mirror: 'During the day women have always preferred the voices of men. I have no idea why. 'There is nothing to stop women coming into broadcasting. 'There are loads on BBC Radio 2. If you look at the news channels, they are all women. I don't think there are enough men on.' The BBC also said that three out of seven of their daytime presenters were female and that they would continue to be 'champions of strong female voices on the radio'. Last Saturday, Blackburn had to stand in to provide cover when Graham Norton failed to turn up to present his morning show on BBC Radio 2. Norton, 51, who is paid £2.3million by the BBC, had been pictured the night before partying with celebrities including Nigella Lawson and Elizabeth Hurley. But Blackburn, who presents a show after Norton’s, said: ‘I think he overslept and thought it was Friday. It was something like that. I am always very early so I was there to stand in.’ Long standing presenters Victoria Derbyshire, left, and Shelagh Fogarty, right, who are both to leave Radio 5 Live . The Irish star's production team had to struggle on with the three-hour programme when he didn't make the 10am start. However, Norton seems to have recovered quickly, as he was seen walking his dogs in the early afternoon. The evening before the show he attended a party with TV chef Nigella Lawson . Maria McErlane, the co-presenter of the programme's Grill Graham problem spot, ended up carrying much of show on her own. Last Saturday, Mr Blackburn had to stand in to provide cover when Graham Norton, pictured, failed to turn up to present his morning show on BBC Radio 2 . McErlane said on-air: 'Fear not, Graham isn't taking hormones. It's Maria McErlane, his old mucker. 'I'm standing in because I fear he has been delayed slightly. But fear not he will be here.' Anxious fans only found out the Eurovision Song Contest presenter had 'been up all night being sick' two hours into the show. The failure to explain Norton's absence led to speculation online that the 51-year-old had gone to Glastonbury or last week's Gay Pride in London. A Radio Five Live female presenter, who is to leave her afternoon show has defended the BBC against gender bias. Shelagh Fogarty, a former co-presenter of 5 Live's breakfast show with Nicky Campbell said it shouldn't be the case that a job held by a woman should then be filled by another woman. Fogarty, 48, said she would spend the summer ‘exploring a number of opportunities, before deciding what’s next’. The broadcaster, who had been with 5 Live for 15 years told The Guardian: 'I don't think it would be a good thing if every time a controller made a decision he or she said it must be a woman. 'Would they have been right to choose a woman just so it looked right, even though they didn't feel that woman was right for the job? 'I really don't feel affronted, as a feminist, that every job a woman has isn't then filled by another woman.","Presenter claims listeners prefer the voices of men on the radio .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Scientists have identified a brain discovered last year as belonging to the world’s first predator. The exquisitely preserved brain was found in a fossil of the creature that lived in the Lower Cambrian, around 520 million years ago. The discovery reveals a brain that is surprisingly simple and less complex than those known from fossils of some of the animal’s prey. Scientists have identified a fossil 520 million years old as a brain belonging to the world's earliest predator, known as Lyrarapax. On the left here can be seen neural structures in the head of the animal, including the brain. On the right is the fossil, a nearly complete specimen of the ancient predator . The find for the first time identifies the fossilised brain of what are considered the top predators of their time, a group of animals known as anomalocaridids, which translates to 'abnormal shrimp.' The fossil of the world's earliest predator, named Lyrarapax, was found in 2013 near Kunming in the Chinese province of Yunnan. It is what is known as an anomalocaridid, which translates as an 'abnormal shrimp'. Just over five inches (13 centimetres) long, Lyrarapax was dwarfed by some of the larger anomalocaridids, which reached more than three feet (one metre) in length. Paleontologists excavating lower Cambrian rocks in southern Australia found that some anomalocaridids had huge compound eyes, up to 10 times larger than the biggest dragonfly eye, meaning they were probably highly efficient hunters. Long extinct, these fierce-looking arthropods were first discovered as fossils in the late 19th century but not properly identified until the early 1980s. They still have scientists arguing over where they belong in the tree of life. ‘Our discovery helps to clarify this debate,’ said Professor Nicholas Strausfeld, director of the University of Arizona's Center for Insect Science and senior author of the paper about the findings. ‘It turns out the top predator of the Cambrian had a brain that was much less complex than that of some of its possible prey and that looked surprisingly similar to a modern group of rather modest worm-like animals.’ The new species has been given the name Lyrarapax unguispinus - Latin for 'piny-clawed lyre-shaped predator’. The brain suggests it is related to a branch of animals whose living descendants are known as onychophorans or velvet worms. These wormlike animals are equipped with stubby unjointed legs that end in a pair of tiny claws. The fossil of the world's earliest predator, named Lyrarapax, was found in 2013 near Kunming in the Chinese province of Yunnan at Chengjiang biota . This artist's impression of Lyararapax, one of the species of the world's first predators, the anomalocaridids, shows it chasing its possible prey, primitive fish that also existed in the Lower Cambrian 520 million years ago. The creature was likely about five inches (13 centimetres) long . Velvet worms, which are also exclusively predators, grow to no more than a few inches in length and are mostly found in the Southern Hemisphere, where they roam the undergrowth and leaf litter in search of beetles and other small insects, their preferred prey. Two long feelers extend from the head, attached in front of a pair of small eyes. The anomalocaridid fossil resembles the anatomy of today's velvet worms in several ways, according to Strausfeld and his collaborators. The worms have a simple brain located in front of the mouth and a pair of ganglia - a collection of nerve cells - located in the front of the optic nerve and at the base of their long feelers. ‘And - surprise, surprise - that is what we also found in our fossil,’ Strausfeld said, pointing out that anomalocaridids had a pair of clawlike grasping appendages in front of the eyes. ‘These top predators in the Cambrian are defined by just their single pair of appendages, wicked-looking graspers, extending out from the front of their head. ‘These are totally different from the antennae of insects and crustaceans. ‘Such frontally disposed appendages are not found in any other living animals with the exception of velvet worms.’ The similarities of their brains and other attributes suggest that the anomalocaridid predators could have been very distant relatives of today's velvet worms.' The ancient predator is believed to have a similar neuro-anatomy to modern velvet worms (pictured), which are also exclusively predators, grow to no more than a few inches in length and are mostly found in the Southern Hemisphere, where they roam the undergrowth and leaf litter in search of prey . This drawing shows the flattened, fossilised trace of the brain of the ancient predator. The X-like structure in the head denotes the fossilised brain. Two dark round spots represent the optic ganglia with nerves that lead from the eyestalks into the head, while the main brain region is in front of the mouth . Xiaoya Ma of the Natural History Museum in London, a co-author on the paper, added: ‘This is another contribution towards the new field of research we call neuropaleontology. 'These grasping appendages are a characteristic feature of this most celebrated Cambrian animal group, whose affinity with living animals has troubled evolutionary scientists for almost a century.' Ma continued that the discovery of the preserved brain helps to clarify similarities with the modern velvet worms. 'Being able to directly associate appendages with parts of the brain in Cambrian animals is a huge advantage,' said co-author Gregory Edgecombe, also at the Natural History Museum. 'For many years now paleontologists have struggled with the question of how different kinds of appendages in Cambrian fossils line up with each other and with what we see in living arthropods. 'Now for the first time, we didn't have to rely just on the external form of the appendages and their sequence in the head to try and sort out segmental identities, but we can draw on the same tool kit we use for extant arthropods - the brain.'","A fossilised brain found near Kunming in China has been identified .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Scientists are still struggling to explain the appearance of a giant sinkhole in the Yamal Peninsula, a remote region of Russia that translates as 'the end of the world'. So far theories have ranged from meteorite strikes to subsurface ice, and even UFOs, but no solid answer has yet been found. A research team sent to investigate the phenomenon is hoping to unearth more information about the baffling feature. Experts are unsure what caused a giant hole in Siberia earlier this week, found in the Yamal Peninsula which is also known as the 'end of the world'. The phenomenon was revealed in incredible footage from a helicopter, a still of which is pictured here . One of the more popular theories is that the giant hole was caused by a phenomenon known as a pingo, illustrated below. This is a subsurface accumulation of ice that has been covered by land. When the ice melts it can leave behind a gaping hole that it once filled. The other favoured theory is that the hole was caused by an explosion of methane underground. The Yamal Peninsula is rich in natural gas, with its resources extensively tapped by Russia, and a mixture of water, salt and gas could result in an explosion. The other theory is that it was caused by a meteorite, but most experts have ruled this possibility out as the phenomenon does not resemble normal impact craters. Remarkable video of the hole in Siberia was reported earlier this week. Aerial images suggest it may be up to 260 feet (80 metres) wide but has an unknown depth. The predominant theory so far is that the feature is a ‘pingo,’ reports the Sunday Morning Herald. A pingo is a large chunk of ice that is located underground that can create a hole in the ground when it melts. ‘Certainly from the images I’ve seen it looks like a periglacial feature, perhaps a collapsed pingo,’ Dr Chris Fogwill of the University of New South Wales said. ‘This is obviously a very extreme version of that, and if there’s been any interaction with the gas in the area, that is a question that could only be answered by going there.’ Others, however, have pointed to the abundance of natural gas in the region as a possible explanation for the hole. 'It’s certainly mysterious,' geologist David Wilshaw, president of Florida-based geology business Britannia Solutions, tells MailOnline. The exact reason behind the hole is a mystery. It may have been caused by a pingo, illustration shown. When the ice eventually melts, it can leave a gaping hole in the ground . 'I don’t think that it’s a “sinkhole”, which is a phenomenon caused by the downwards collapse of the land surface into an existing cavity in the ground.' He also adds it's unlikely to be a meteor strike as it 'would not leave such a deep and steep sided hole, and the impact pattern would be different.' Wilshaw continued: 'There is a ridge of material around the edge, so this suggests some kind of “explosion” out of the ground. 'The reports I’ve seen suggest that this is not an area of volcanic activity, though. 'Most likely it was caused by the explosion of a pocket of natural gas that had accumulated near to the surface, perhaps in an existing underground cavern system, that somehow either ignited - explaining the “scorched” edge - or expanded until it reached some critical pressure that it blew the permafrost surface off.' He added that the feature was 'unique, hence all of the head scratching!' The region, with the hole denoted by the marker here, is known for its permafrost and pingos, which could account for the formation of this bizarre phenomenon . The Yamal Peninsula is a remote region of Russia that is rich in natural gas, which has led some experts to suggest that the hole may have been caused by the ignition and subsequent explosion of methane underground. The region is also known for its reindeer, pictured here . One of the more popular theories is that the giant hole was caused by a phenomenon known as a pingo. This is a subsurface accumulation of ice that has been covered by land. When the ice melts it can leave behind a gaping hole that it once filled. Pictured is a pingo in Tuktoyaktuk, Northwest Territories, Canada . Other experts have also cast their opinion on the phenomenon. 'I am not really familiar with the geological and climatic setting of the “sinkhole” location in Siberia, however, it does appear to be in a very cold climate area therefore it is possibly a “pingo,”' sinkhole expert Dr Clive Edmonds of Reading's Peter Brett Associates told MailOnline. 'These features are associated with very cold glacial landscapes where groundwater lenses freeze beneath a soil cover, for example, and as more groundwater is drawn into the freezing lens of water the ground above lifts to form small conical hills hundreds of metres across and high. 'If seasonal climate change occurs then the frozen lens of water would melt and leak away reversing the hydraulic pressure and flow of water when the pingo formed. 'The unsupported top of such a feature could then possibly collapse to create a crater as seen. 'Alternatively the chemistry of the groundwater being drawn in to the forming pingo may change (for example, salty water instead of fresh water), which could cause changes in the ice volume. 'There is clearly much speculation going on and really it needs people on the ground investigating the particular conditions and geology present to confirm what is happening.' He added that 'it appears unlikely to be a true “sinkhole”, in other words a ground settlement or collapse over a void formed in a soluble rock such as limestone, gypsum or salt.' Dr Edmonds also added that climate change could pose a problem, saying: 'I guess that climate change causing the atmosphere to warm would lead to a lessening of the severity of the climate in glacial areas and therefore pingo collapse might become more commonplace in such areas in time. 'We’ll have to wait and see!' The mysterious hole is in the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Region, which is some 20 miles (32 kilometres) from the Bovanenkovo gas field . At the time some thought it may have been caused by a meteorite . But predominant theories now suggest it was a 'pingo' or explosion from the natural gas. Pictured is the road to the Bovanenkovo gas field . Yamal has some of the world’s largest natural gas reserves, which has led to extensive pumping of the region. This caused some experts to suggest the hole could be the consequence of a giant explosion underground. According to the Siberian Times Anna Kurchatova from the Sub-Arctic Scientific Research Centre thinks a mixture of water, salt and gas could have ignited such an explosion. The region is geologically quite young, at about 10,000 years, and its possible gas was trapped in ice beneath the surface, but global warming has melted the ice and released the gas, like popping a champagne cork. A spokesman for the Russian Emergencies Ministry, meanwhile, previously ruled out the possibility of it being a meteorite impact crater to the Siberian Times. ‘We can definitely say that it is not a meteorite. No details yet,’ they said. Experts also say that the darkening around the inner rim of the crater indicates 'severe burning' which scorched its edges. The expedition currently taking place is being organised by the Yamal authorities and includes experts from Russia's Centre for the Study of the Arctic, and also the Cryosphere Institute of the Academy of Sciences. They plan to take samples of soil, air and water from the scene and they will be accompanied by a specialist from Russia's Emergencies Ministry in an attempt to solve the mystery once and for all.","Experts are unsure what caused a giant hole in Siberia earlier this week .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . A 4,300 year-old wall painting has been found in a tomb for a ‘priest’ in Egypt. The find was made about 1,000 feet (300 metres) to the east of the Great Pyramid of Giza, containing depictions of ancient life. It was found alongside statues that indicated the occupant was an important individual. A wall painting, dating back over 4,300 years, has been discovered in a tomb (pictured) located just east of the Great Pyramid of Giza. The painting shows vivid scenes of life, including boats sailing south on the Nile River, a bird hunting trip in a marsh and a man named Perseneb with his wife and dog . The ancient Egyptian afterlife is one of the earliest known recorded belief systems in history. People . believed that when a person died their soul known as ka - or body . double - and the ba - their personality - would go to the Kingdom of the . Dead. While . their soul stayed in the Fields of Aaru, Osiris - the god of the . afterlife - demanded work in return for his protection, which is why you . often see farming scenes inside tombs. Statues . were placed in tombs to serve as substitutes for a person. In order to . reach the afterlife, a person had to have a pure heart as well as recite . passwords, spells and forumlae from the Book of the Dead. People . believed that in the Hall of Two truths the heart was weighed and if it . was lighter than the Shu feather, they could pass on - or be destroyed . by a demon. Mummification . and the sarcophagus was a requirement for being able to access the . afterlife and the Fields of Yalu. The 'opening of the mouth' ceremony . was of importance as well as the presence of objects such as jewellery . to keep a body safe on its dangerous journey. The tomb is thought to have been built about 2450 to 2350 BC in the middle or late fifth dynasty, a time within the Old Kingdom, Egypt's first sustained period of civilisation. Tombs of this sort were created for important indivudals during the Old Kingdom from about 2650 to 2150 BC. This is also the perod when the Giza pyramids were built. Although the tomb was originally found in the 19th century, it was not until recent restoration work by Russian archaeologists that the painting was discovered. ‘Known since the 19th century, the [tomb] could hardly present any new principal features,’ Maksim Lebedev of the Russian State University for Humanities told Live Science. ‘Therefore, it was a real surprise to discover an Old Kingdom painting on the eastern wall of the central room.' The team will release further images of the painting in the coming weeks as more of it is revealed. Made of white plaster it had been covered by soot and dirt, from not only nearby industrialisation but also people living in the tomb. Despite only 30 per cent being preserved, researchers were able to recreate the scenes that were left, with a hint of symbolic meaning. Archaeologists have found thew previously hidden painting in an ancient tomb near Cairo in Egypt. The tomb belongs to a 'priest' named Persaneb. It has been known of for centuries but the painting has only just been found as it was buried beneath soot and dirt . The painting depicts what life was like 4,300 years ago in Egypt. It shows boats sailing south on the Nile and also agricultural images. The painting could also have symbolic meaning for life in ancient Egypt. Inside the tomb were also found statues of the 'priest' including his wife and what looks like a dog (pictured) At the top of the painting ships sail south on the Nile, possibly heralding the return of a person of power from the north, which represents a person's high status. Other parts of the painting shown agricultural scenes such as plowing and sowing. And one part shows Perseneb with his wife and what appears to be his dog, while another section seems to show a marsh scene where a man on a boat is bird hunting. Exactly who Perseneb’s position was in ancient Egypt, however, is unknown, although inscriptions indicate he was a 'priest' and a 'steward'. Tombs of this sort were usually made for important individuals, especially ones with statues, so it is likely he was someone of some stature. There are three rooms in the tomb - an offering room, central room and burial chamber - and 11 statutes are strewn across the rooms showing Perseneb and his family. The tomb is thought to have been built about 2450 to 2350 BC in the middle or late fifth dynasty, a time within the Old Kingdom, Egypt's first sustained period of civilisation. Tombs of this sort were created for important individuals during the Old Kingdom from about 2650 to 2150 BC, also when the Giza pyramids were built .","Archaeologists have found a previously hidden painting in an ancient tomb .

"By . Jennifer Newton . Government forces in Ukraine are claiming a major victory after taking back a rebel-held city in the east of the country after a night of heavy fighting. President Petro Poroshenko said in a statement that government troops took Slovyansk, a city of about 100,000 that has been a centre of the fighting between Kiev's troops and the pro-Russian insurgents. Mr Poroshenko ordered the armed forces to raise the Ukrainian flag over the city, which has been under control of the rebels since early April when they seized the city's administrative and police buildings. Pro-Russian separatists board buses as they leave their positions in Kramatorsk in eastern Ukraine after they lost control of the city of Slovyansk . Ukrainian troops at a checkpoint near Slovyansk after the pro-Russian troops fled the stronghold in the east of the country . Slovyansk has been the strongest gain during the conflict with government forces in eastern Ukraine. But its re-capture is Kiev's most notable military victory in three months of fighting in which more than 200 Ukrainian troops have been killed as well as hundreds of civilians and rebels. Mr Poroshenko's website said separatist fighters had come under mortar fire as they tried to break through government forces' lines. The separatists had lost one tank and other armoured vehicles, a statement said. 'The president gave the order ... for the state flag to be raised on Slovyansk's town council offices', it added, referring to one of the city's main rebel headquarters. However, Andriy Lysenko, spokesman for the National Security and Defence Council, said mopping-up operations were continuing. 'Slovyansk is under siege. Now an operation is going on to neutralise small groups hiding in buildings where peaceful citizens are living,' Mr Lysenko told journalists. The Russian separatists had lost a tank and other armoured vehicles in the heavy fighting which was said to have raged last night . Andrei Purgin, of the separatist Donetsk People's Republic, added that rebels were evacuating, but claimed the army's campaign had left the city 'in ruins'. Mr Purgin also said 150 fighters injured in Slovyansk were in Donetsk for treatment. 'More than a hundred militiamen have been killed in the last three days,' said Viktor, a 35-year-old Slovyansk native who had a shrapnel wound in his leg. 'The mood is very bad. It seems that we've lost this war. And Russia isn't in a hurry to help.' A rebel commander said that rebels had relocated to the nearby town of Kramatorsk, 20 kilometres (12 miles) south of Slovyansk. But outside Kramatorsk, an abandoned checkpoint and several hundred rebels, armed and in uniform, were spotted driving in minibuses in the direction of Donetsk. But some rebels played down the significance of Ukraine's advances with Pavel Gubarev, the self-described governor of the Donetsk People's Republic, writing online that the rebels had staged a tactical retreat. Rebels were evacuating Slovyansk, but it was claimed that the Ukrainian army, pictured, had left the city 'in ruins . The president's website said separatist fighters had come under mortar fire from government forces as they tried to break through their lines . 'Kutuzov also retreated, as that was the plan,' he wrote, referring to the 19th century general Mikhail Kutuzov who is credited with defeating Napoleon's forces in Russia. 'In general, Russians only retreat before a decisively victorious battle.' However, others in the rebels' ranks pleaded publicly with Russia to assist the rebels in their cause. In a video posted online late yesterday, Igor Girkin, the self-described commander in chief of the Donetsk People's Republic, said his men had 'lost the will to fight'. 'They want to live in Russia,"" said Mr Girkin, also known by his nom de guerre, Igor Strelkov. 'But when they tried to assert this right, Russia doesn't want to help.' Mr Poroshenko's website said separatist fighters had come under mortar fire as they tried to break through government forces' lines . The Russian foreign ministry said it was bolstering efforts to deliver medical aid to those in eastern Ukraine, but made no mention of the rebels' defeat in Slovyansk or plans to provide military aid. Rebel leaders have pleaded with the Kremlin for military assistance in the past, and some prominent Russian nationalists have publicly taunted President Vladimir Putin, accusing him of cowardice. Mr Poroshenko had said yesterday he was ready to conduct another round of talks between representatives from Ukraine, Russia and the rebels. But with the rebels reeling from their attack today, it was unclear whether negotiations could take place. Uprisings in eastern Ukraine erupted in April as rebels took over state buildings, built a powerful arsenal of seized weapons and declared their independence from Kiev, calling the pro-European government illegitimate. The Ukrainian government forces move an anti-aircraft missile launcher after rebels left the city of Slovyansk in the east of the city . The crisis began when street protests ousted the Moscow-backed Viktor Yanukovich in late February for rejecting a landmark political and trade deal with the European Union in favour of closer ties with Russia. Russia subsequently annexed Crimea and separatist revolts against the new Kiev authorities broke out with rebels declaring ""people's republics"" and saying they wanted to join Russia. Slovyansk, a city of 130,000 people, became a hotbed of resistance under the military command of Igor Strelkov as defence minister of the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic. It has increasingly appeared to be going its own way independently of the rebel groups controlling Donetsk, the main industrial hub, and Luhansk, and many of the rebel violations of a government ceasefire which expired last Monday appeared to come from Slovyansk.","Troops have taken back the rebel held city of Slovyansk in east of Ukraine .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . In 2011 Japan was rocked by a magnitude 9 earthquake, the most powerful in the country’s recorded history, which together with a tsunami killed more than 15,000 people and caused upwards of £20.2 billion ($34.6 billion) in damage. But it seems the effects of the earthquake are not over yet, as the huge tremor may have disrupted Mount Fuji and placed it in a critical condition. The result could be an eruption that mimics the last in 1707, which bathed vast swathes of Japan in ash and caused untold damage, at a time when the country was much less populated. French and Japanese scientists say that Mount Fuji is at higher risk of eruption. Its last major eruption was in 1707, at a time when the country was much less populated. In the modern day, just 60 miles (100 kilometres) south west of Tokyo (pictured), an eruption could be catastrophic . The research was carried out by scientists at the Institute of Earth Sciences in Grenoble, France and the Institute of Global Physics in Paris, working in collaboration with Japanese scientists. At an elevation of 3,776 metres (12,388 feet), Mount Fuji is the highest mountain in Japan. It is an active stratovolcano found on Honshu island that last erupted in December 1707. Known as the Hoei eruption, this is thought to have expelled a billion cubic metres of ash and debris. Mount Fuji lies 60 miles (100 kilometres) south west of Tokyo, which in 1707 was called Edo. On 22 June 2014 Mount Fuji was added to the World Heritage List as a Cultural Site, one of Japan’s ‘Three Holy Mountains’. For the first time they observed the response of Japanese volcanoes to seismic waves produced by the Tohoko earthquake of 2011. Their conclusions, published in Science, reveal how earthquakes can impact volcanoes and should help to assess the risk of massive volcanic eruptions worldwide. 'Our work does not say that the volcano will start erupting, but it does show that it's in a critical state,' Dr Florent Brenguier, lead author of the publication, told The Guardian. After the giant Tohoku-oki earthquake of 2011, the researchers analysed over 70 terabytes of seismic data from the network. For the first time, they showed that the regions where the perturbations of the Earth's crust were the greatest were not those where the shocks were the strongest. They were in fact localised under volcanic regions, especially under Mount Fuji. The reason for this is likely due to fluids trapped under the volcano such as boiling water and liquid magma. ‘Essentially the idea is that before this study we had very few methods to know the state of pressure of the volcano at depth,’ Dr Brenguier tells MailOnline. ‘With this new method, we are able to get insights on how the interior of the volcano, the part between the magma chamber and the surface, is affected. ‘We think that these are important in the preparation of eruption.’ The new research shows how volcanoes can be affected, or induce, earthquakes. Previous research suggests Mount Fuji, which is found on Honshu Island, may be sitting on a active fault 19 miles (30 kilometres) wide that could be capable of causing magnitude 7 earthquakes, possibly enough to cause an eruption . The crustal seismic velocity drop induced by the Tohoku earthquake highlights a large anomaly below Mt Fuji volcano, as seen here in this 3D rendering released by the researchers . The researchers found a high anomaly beneath the volcano, despite it being 310 miles (500 kilometres) from the epicentre of the 2011 earthquake, suggesting pressure was building. However, Dr Brenguier adds: ‘It is not possible within our results to know when an eruption will occur or what size it will be. ‘We were just able to map the fact there is an anomaly in the partly pressurised region, so the volcanic risk in that region is higher.' ‘I can’t tell about future eruptions, but what I can say is we are expecting a new earthquake rather close to Mount Fuji. ‘Within 100 kilometres a large earthquake is expected. ‘If there were this large earthquake close, again the risk would be very high of having an eruption.’ In 2011 Japan was rocked by a magnitude 9 earthquake named Tohoko, the most powerful in the country's recorded history, which together with a tsunami killed more than 15,000 people and caused upwards of £20.2 billion ($34.6 billion) in damage . The last time Mount Fuji erupted was on 16 December 1707, and that eruption was preceded by the violent 8.7-magnitude Hoei earthquake 49 days before. It spread ash of varying levels across east Japan (shown). The researchers say no eruption is imminent at the moment, however . The findings were made using 800 seismic sensors and recording fluctuations underground that can map geological disturbances. The new method thus enabled the scientists to observe the anomalies caused by the perturbations from the earthquake in volcanic regions under pressure. Mount Fuji, which exhibits the greatest anomaly, is probably under great pressure, although no eruption has yet followed the Tohoku earthquake. The last time Mount Fuji erupted was on 16 December 1707, and that eruption was preceded by the violent 8.7-magnitude Hoei earthquake 49 days before. With regards to the 2011 earthquake on 11 March, it was followed by a 6.4 magnitude quake four days later. This confirmed the criticial state of Mounti Fuji to the researchers. They add, however, that there is no need for evacuation or any other drastic measures in Japan yet, although caution must be taken. ‘All we can say is that Mount Fuji is now in a state of pressure, which means it displays a high potential for eruption,’ Dr Brenguier added to the Guardian. ‘The risk is clearly higher.’ The researchers showed for the first time that the regions where the perturbations of the Earth's crust were the greatest after the 2011 earthquake were not those where the shocks were the strongest, but under volcanic regions, especially under Mount Fuji (pictured from space) The ‘critical’ nature of the volcano comes from the state of . the magma stored 3.1 miles (five kilometres) beneath the surface in the rock mass. ‘This part of the crust is kind of . critical in a sense that perturbation from seismic waves generated by an . earthquake will generate quite significantly in the crust,' Dr Brenguier tells MailOnline. ‘It is critical in fracturation of the rock mass below the volcano. ‘This could eventually lead to transport of magma to the surface. ‘We can say that there is a high risk, there is a zone, an area that we image, that shows an anomaly of pressure.‘There were theories that the magma should be quite pressurised because the last eruption was 300 years ago. ‘For the first time we made a direct observation of this kind of critical stage. But he adds it is not possible within their results for the researchers to give an exact timescale for when an eruption might occur.","French and Japanese scientists say Mount Fuji is at higher risk of eruption .

"By . Jack Doyle, Political Correspondent . One in 14 women giving birth in the UK are either temporary migrants or visitors – and cost taxpayers £182million a year. These new mothers, around 50,000, account for 7 per cent of NHS maternity spending. The official figures indicate the likely scale of ‘maternity tourism’ whereby women from overseas come to Britain purely to give birth. It exposes the huge pressure put on already stretched services from those with no right to free NHS care – and comes just a week after it emerged half of NHS trusts had to close their maternity units last year. Bimbo Ayelabola, who gave birth to quintuplets on the NHS after travelling to the UK, costing taxpayers £200,000 . The statistics were revealed as Jeremy Hunt announced a system aiming to recover £500million a year of the estimated £2billion annual cost of health tourism. Patients from outside the EU are currently charged after receiving NHS care, but only a fraction of these costs are paid. Under the Health Secretary’s plans, they will be charged one-and-a-half times the cost of the treatment in advance. They will also pay a £200 upfront charge when they obtain a visa. Health trusts who fail to track down those with no right to free care could face swingeing fines running to millions of pounds. But the plans show that migrants who refuse to pay in advance will still be entitled to emergency treatment – because of the Human Rights Act. This includes all maternity services. Treatment regarded as ‘urgent’ because it cannot wait until the overseas visitor returns home will also be provided even if hospital staff cannot secure a deposit. Professor J Meirion Thomas, of the Royal Marsden Hospita, pictured,l in London, has said that the flow of West African women flying in to give birth for free at Guy¿s and St Thomas¿ NHS Trust, was so common . Details of the cost of maternity care were released in Department of Health documents accompanying the plan. It said research suggests ‘overseas visitors and migrants’ from Europe and beyond account for around 2 per cent of NHS resources but 7 per cent of its maternity spending. Last year the NHS spent a total of £2.6billion on maternity care, £182million of which funded the treatment of foreign visitors and temporary migrants. MPs called on ministers to stop heavily pregnant women getting on planes to come to the UK to give birth. Tory MP Andrew Percy, who sits on the Health Select Committee said: ‘People must not be allowed to come to this country to use maternity services that they are not paying for. I am glad the Government is going to start charging these people but the worry is that many of them still will not pay. ‘Perhaps we should be thinking about making sure our border controls are erected to stop women getting on a plane if they are heavily pregnant.’ London doctors have described how foreign nationals deliberately board flights from Africa in the weeks prior to their due date to use the capital’s hospitals. Professor J Meirion Thomas, of the Royal Marsden Hospital in London, has said that the flow of West African women flying in to give birth for free at Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Trust, was so common it was referred to by staff as the ‘Lagos Shuttle’. In just two years, border  officials at Gatwick Airport stopped more than 300 women from overseas ‘arriving in an advanced stage of pregnancy who evidently intend to access NHS maternity services’. There remains a maternity crisis in the NHS because of the growing birth rate in the UK. There is already a shortage of around 4,500 midwives in the NHS in England. Last week figures showed half of health trusts in England had to close their maternity units at least once in the last year because of a lack of midwives or beds, with closures lasting anything from a few hours to several days. Patients from outside the EU are currently charged after receiving NHS care, but only a fraction of these costs are paid . The Department of Health estimates that just £73million was recovered from overseas visitors and migrants last year. It is not known how much was recovered for maternity care. Mr Hunt said: ‘We have no problem with international visitors using the NHS as long as they pay for it – just as British families do through their taxes. ‘These plans will help recoup up to £500million a year, making sure the NHS is better resourced and more sustainable at a time when doctors and nurses on the frontline are working very hard.’ But doctors’ groups questioned whether the plans were practical and insisted health staff were required to treat the sick. Dr Mark Porter, of the British Medical Association, said: ‘Anyone accessing NHS services should be eligible to do so but a doctor’s duty is to treat the patient that’s in front of them, not to act as border guard. ‘There are question marks over whether … the NHS has the infrastructure and resources necessary to administrate a cost-effective charging system. ‘Above all, it’s vitally important these proposals don’t have an impact on the care patients receive and that sick and vulnerable patients aren’t deterred from seeking necessary treatment, which can have a knock on effect on public health.’ Last year the NHS spent a total of £2.6billion on maternity care, £182million of which funded the treatment of foreign visitors and temporary migrants . A Nigerian gave birth to quintuplets on the NHS after travelling to the UK while pregnant in 2011. Bimbo Ayelabola’s care is estimated to have cost taxpayers around £200,000. Despite being married to a business tycoon, Ohi Nasir Ilavbare, the 33-year-old applied for a six-month visitor’s visa soon after finding she was pregnant, and came to the UK without her husband to visit her three sisters. Miss Ayelabola had become pregnant with five babies by taking fertility drug Clomid for eight times longer than recommended. She gave birth to two boys and three girls after a complex caesarean section and stayed in hospital for almost two weeks, paid for by the taxpayer. She was later found to be illegally working as an Avon lady. In 2012 another heavily-pregnant woman, whose identity is not known, flew from her home in Nigeria to take advantage of NHS maternity services. She had £10,000 of treatment but is understood to have returned home with her baby without paying a penny. The Harvard-educated woman travelled 3,200 miles from Lagos to Manchester because she was worried about standards of care in her country and thought she would be in safer hands in the UK. At Wythenshawe Hospital she told doctors there were complications with her pregnancy. Two midwives, two urology consultants, a radiology consultant, two obstetric consultants and two anaesthetists attended her in the delivery room before her baby was born by emergency caesarean. Staff sought billing details and told her the cost was around £10,000. However, she is not thought to have paid anything. Nigeria offers free maternity care but the quality is very poor and there is a high mortality rate.","One in 14 mothers giving birth in the UK are temporary migrants or visitors .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . To date, nearly all planets found outside the solar system have followed a strict naming convention, which has led to rather complicated names such as OGLE235-MOA53 b. That’s all set to change later this year, though, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU) will allow the public to vote on the names of exoplanets for the first time. A list of 305 confirmed planets found before 31 December 2008 has been drawn up, and in October names can be submitted for consideration for some of the planets. Paris-based IAU will let the public vote on names for planets next year. This is the first time they will have allowed planets to be named this way. Previously nomenclature for exoplanets had followed strict guidelines. But now in September astronomy clubs will be invited to submit names . The IAU, headquartered Paris, has not previously allowed many planets or stars to be named. Exoplanets are currently named according to strict rules that denote their characteristics. Take the planet HD 177830 b for example. The first part denotes the star the planet is in orbit around, which is HD 177830. The lowercase letter then explains where the planet sits in its system; b is the innermost planet (which would be Mercury in our solar system), followed by c, d and so on. If the planet is in a multiple star system, the lowercase latter preceded by an uppercase one for the star. The ‘primary star’ is labelled with an ‘A’, with its companion stars labelled B, C and so on. So if our example planet was orbiting around the primary star in a binary system, its full name would be HD 177830 Ab . This was partly because thousands of planets have been found, and the naming process would simply be too long and complicated. But the IAU, in association with Zooniverse, has decided to allow a select few planets to be named, owing to the large public interest in doing so, called the NameExoWorlds contest. In September, astronomy clubs and non-profit organisations will be allowed to sign up for the IAU Directory for World Astronomy website (directory.iau.org). Then in October, of the 305 planets 20 to 30 will be selected for naming. Only 305 initial planets were selected as more recent discoveries haven’t been confirmed, and the IAU didn’t want to select planets that might later be proven to not exist. In December the clubs and organisations will be invited to send proposals for names, subject to the IAU’s naming rules. These state that a proposed name cannot be more than 16 characters, it must be pronounceable, it cannot be offensive and the names of living people will not be allowed. This will rule out certain groups attempting to hijack the contest and submit rude, offensive or inappropriate names. In March 2015 the public will be allowed to vote on the proposed names and finally, in August 2015, the results will be announced at a ceremony in Honolulu. The names of planets will coexist alongside their existing scientific names, just like what is done for other celestial bodies now. For example the Orion Nebula is also scientifically known as Messier 42. More than 800 planets have been found outside the solar system to date, with thousands more waiting to be confirmed. The diversity of these planets has been tremendous, with some found orbiting binary stars (illustration shown) and others found in tight orbits - but few have been given 'proper' names . Exoplanets are currently named according to strict rules that denote their characteristics. First the planet is given the name of its host star, here being the star Kepler-186. Then it is given a letter denoting its order, with b being the closest, then c, d and so on . ‘People have been naming celestial objects for millennia, long before any scientific system of names ever existed,’ explains the IAU. ‘Even today, almost every civilisation and culture uses common names to describe the stars and planets visible to the naked eye, as well as their apparent distribution on the sky.’ The IAU, founded in 1919, is the world’s largest professional body for astronomers with more than 11,000 members across 90 countries. Among other roles, the IAU is tasked with deciding upon nomenclature for celestial objects. As all the planets in the solar system are named, this first involved naming comets, asteroids and dwarf planets. When planets started to be found, though, it was clear many names would be needed. While the current system is useful to sift through the large numbers of planets, many have petitioned the IAU for more flexibility on certain planets, and they now have their wish. Although the IAU doesn’t technically ‘own’ space, it still maintains the database of named objects in the night sky, making this an ‘official’ naming process for exoplanets. The new 'official' naming system will allow planets outside the solar system to be named by members of public for the first name. This could give rise to names based on things from popular culture such as Tatooine from Star Wars (pictured), a popular choice for space enthusiasts .","Paris-based IAU will let the public vote on names for planets next year .

The high life: Anthony Dokoupil ran some 50 tons of Colombian marijuana worth some $6 million up the east coast from Florida over the course of his career . Tony discovered that their family holidays had actually been an excuse to find drug money that had been hidden away around America. When they visited family his mother would go into the back yard and dig up some of the $1 million they had buried at relatives’ homes. Tony writes that the illusion of his childhood fell apart - he had lived a life of luxury and was enrolled at the prestigious Gulliver Prep school in Miami where his classmates included President George H.W. Bush's grandchildren. His father owned two Mercedes cars, a 35-foot yacht, holidays to the Caribbean but it all collapsed when Anthony committed the ‘cardinal sin’ of being a drug dealer, becoming an addict himself. By the time he was arrested in 1992 all the money had gone and he was working on a sanitation crew on Miami Beach to make ends meet - and was even happy to see the US Marshals. In his memoir ‘The Last Pirate: A Father, His Son and the Golden Age of Marijuana’, Tony says that between 1975 and 1986 his father distributed at least 50 tons of Colombian and Mexican pot into America. Anthony became known as ‘Old Man’ or . ‘Big Tony’ because he was unflappable in a crisis - a temperament which . would serve him well in the drug trade. He . was born in 1946 in New Jersey and had a genius IQ but started using . heroin whilst at the University of Detroit and dropped out before . heading back to Milford, Connecticut. He married his wife Ann who would become Tony’s mother and help him run his drug empire. Anthony . started off his operation by renting a car, driving down to Florida and . driving marijuana back himself before selling it in the North East. Video Source YouTube . Best schooling drug money can buy: Tony was sent to the best prep school in Florida, which he attended with members of the Bush family . Good times: Things were good for the family as Dokoupil's business, dubbed the Reefer Express, flourished to become one of the biggest of its era . He did well and hired three more drivers in a service he dubbed the ‘Reefer Express’. By the early 1980s they were meeting sailboats from Florida full of pot at docks and transporting the product in a garbage trucks and a refrigerated truck made to look like a fish delivery van. The money began flowing in and during one deal he had to carry around a million dollars in a box to make a deal at a Manhattan hotel. Anthony invested $660,000 in a gold mine, stashed another $200,000 away and moved his family to Miami. Tony writes that his father always said he would quit after making his first million and he did in 1985 - but he could not handle retirement. He had also started to use drugs himself. Tony writes: ‘The Old Man was restless in paradise. ‘He . had broken a cardinal rule of dealing and become an addict himself. Coke and hookers, mostly. He left the party early in search of both.’ When . the Reagan administration’s War on Drugs began to strangle the pot . supply in America Anthony came out of retirement and assembled an . Ocean’s Eleven style crew for their biggest job yet. The . gang, who had names like Timber Tom and Scrimshaw Mike, planned it at . the famous Landmark Tavern in Manhattan where they spent days hogging a . table and constantly using the payphone. The . plan was to smuggle nearly 18 tons of Colombian weed to a port in . Virginia and it nearly failed when Anthony had to rescue a truck full of . pot that had been abandoned by a driver because the gas pedal was . sticky. But thanks to his cool head it was a . success and he split the $1.5 million profits with his partner - as they . celebrated in the penthouse suite of the Plaza Hotel in New York. It . was his biggest ever score but despite his success Anthony’s addictions . were claiming ever more of his money and destroying his family. In 1986 they fled Florida and rented a motor home, embarking on a tour of states like New Mexico, New England and New York. For . Tony it was great fun but the trip had another purpose - to hunt down . money that was buried in back yards during his father’s glory days. As . he slept inside a cousin’s house in Albuquerque - earlier they had . bought fossils and visited the Petrified Forest National Park - his . mother was out the back hauling a cooler containing a quarter of a . million dollars out of the ground. Too high: Things began to unravel as Anthony, now in his 60s, spent all the family's money on coke and hookers . Now: Anthony now lives in subsidized housing in Massachusetts and occasionally uses crack cocaine . They had to drive it back home because his mother could not board a plane with more than $10,000 in cash. Despite the haul it all went on his father’s addiction to drugs and by the time Tony was nine  things began to fall apart. Anthony lost his ID so could not access many of the safety deposit boxes he had stored it in. He gave $75,000 to a woman he had just met because the registration on his Mercedes had expired and he was worried about getting caught. With no money for school fees Tony became known as the poor kid because he could not afford basic supplies. Anthony’s last $50,000 was spent in Miami sleeping with three prostitutes at a time before he became a homeless bum and slept under a highway. It was not until Tony was 20 - 11 years after he last saw him - that he wanted to learn the truth so looked his father up. Despite being happily married ith a job he loves, Tony writes that his . father 'still haunts me, making me fearful of the genes I carry and the . man I may become’ Anthony, who served a year and a half in jail, is now in his 60s and currently lives in Cambridge, MA, in government-subsidized housing where he still occasionally uses crack. Tony writes that his father has left him a complicated legacy and a conviction to ensure that his own son has more stability than he did. Anthony is also unapologetic about what he has done and told his son: ‘I’ve liked my life’. In the book he says: ‘I liked the drugs and the girls and the money. I liked living like a pirate, outside the real world, never doing anything but dabbling and talking.’ Before writing the book Tony has spoken of his anxiety over his family before and in an article for Newsweek he has said: ‘My father's implosion has been too complete for me to really fear becoming him. ‘I have a lovely wife, good health, great friends, and a job I like, so it's hard for me to imagine detouring into a life of drugs and crime. ‘But he still haunts me, making me fearful of the genes I carry and the man I may become.’ In an interview to promote the book on CBS, Tony said that the cover story he had been given for years was that his dad sold real estate. It was true - but it was not the whole truth. The search for his dad led him to the National Archives in Boston where he pulled out an indictment charging his dad with drug trafficking, and he tracked him down.","Tony Dokoupil's new book The Last Pirate details how his father Anthony ran one of the biggest marijuana operations in the last century .

"By . Lydia Warren . Loss: Matthew Burdette committed suicide in November after weeks of bullying, his family said . A 14-year-old Boy Scout took his life after a classmate filmed him touching himself in a school bathroom before spreading the footage around, the victim's family has revealed. Matthew Burdette committed suicide on November 29 last year - and his family are now speaking out in a bid to get answers about how the school acted before and after his death. After officials at University City High School in San Diego, California refused to give them information, the teenager's friends revealed that Matthew had been bullied after a video of him went viral, the family told News10. Two weeks before his death, Matthew was kicked out of class for eating sunflower seeds and, with nowhere else to go, headed to the bathroom at University City High School, his family said. There, a . fellow classmate peered over a stall and recorded Matthew. He posted the . video to Snapchat, Vine and other social networking sites, claiming the . teen was masturbating in the footage. 'It . went viral,' his distraught aunt, Laura Burdette Mechak, told News 10. 'It went beyond his school. It went to other schools in . California. Kids in the neighborhood who didn't go to Matthew's school . had heard about it and seen the video that was taken of him.' For two weeks, teenagers made his life 'miserable', his aunt said. Promising: Burdette, pictured as a young Boy Scout, left a suicide note saying he didn't have any friends . Matthew . never told his parents about the video. But he wrote a suicide note . explaining that he didn't want to kill himself but that he had no . friends and couldn't deal with school anymore, his aunt said. After learning about the video, the parents returned to University City High School to talk to officials. The school had launched an investigation - which the parents say means they knew about the video - but they would not tell the Burdettes what had happened to the boy accused of filming their son. The family then went to the San Diego Police Department, where they learned that the boy who took the video confessed and had been arrested, but the District Attorney failed to answer their questions. The DA simply told News 10 there is a hearing on the matter scheduled for July 23. Facing these continuous roadblocks from the school and other authorities, Burdette's mother wrote a letter to the School Board demanding answers - and just minutes later, the incensed Board of Education president called them saying he had heard nothing about the incident. Questions: Despite repeated contact with the school and DA, the family, left, do not know what happened - if anything - to the boy who is accused of posting the video of Matthew, left and right . Scene: He had attended University High School, where he played polo and was on the wrestling team . He reached out to the family saying they were in contact with the DA, but did not say if the school district had punished the boy accused of filming Matthew. The district has not yet responded to MailOnline's requests for comment. The family says they are not angry at the boy who filmed their son but they hope to highlight the dangers of cyberbullying. They also hope to finally get some of the answers they are looking for. They have filed a claim against the San Diego Unified School District . for failing to protect their son and have six months to file a lawsuit. In his obituary, he was remembered as an active student. 'Matthew was a student at University High School where he played Water Polo and was on the Wrestling Team,' it read. 'He was also a Boy Scout with Troop 260 working toward his Eagle rank.'","Matthew Burdette took his life in November and his family has struggled to get answers from the school about what happened before his death .

"By . Associated Press . An Arkansas woman was charged on Tuesday with manslaughter in the death of her 10-month-old son after investigators said she and her husband took the boy into a rugged part of the Ouachita Mountains while having drug-induced hallucinations about being chased. Brooke Sueann Floyd, 21, of Greenwood, surrendered to Yell County officers on Tuesday and went free under terms of a $50,000 bond posted on a previous child endangerment charge. She is due in a Danville court on Thursday. Scroll down for video . Brooke Sueann Floyd (pictured in her police mugshot last weekend). Floyd, whose husband and son were found dead in the Ouachita Mountains, has been charged with felony manslaughter . Brian Floyd and his ten-month-old son Harper Floyd were found dead in the remote Ouachita Mountains in Arkansas on July 29 . The baby boy, Harper, and Floyd's husband, 33-year-old Brian Floyd, were found dead last week after a four-day search in an area about 80 miles west of Little Rock. Deputies said they suspected something was amiss when Brooke Floyd emerged from heavy brush and reported the pair missing but didn't tell searchers where they might be. 'I asked her if she was taking any medication because she appeared to be hallucinating many of the events she described,' sheriff's Capt. John Foster Jr. wrote in an affidavit. She said the woman told him she had recently used methamphetamine and an anti-seizure medication. Foster also wrote that Floyd initially told officers the family was being chased but later believed the story was based on mutual hallucinations she was having with her husband. 'She seemed to be indicating that they would tell each other what they were seeing or experiencing as they were hallucinating and then the other would believe they also saw or experienced the same thing,' Foster wrote. The 21-year-old mother (pictured with baby Harper) is due in court on Thursday on manslaughter charges over her 10-month-old son's death . Brooke Floyd was found July 25 in a ditch in the Ouachita National Forest, with bruises, bare feet and scratches that suggested she had walked through the thick woods for a long time, Foster said. According to an affidavit seen by Thv11, Brooke Floyd told police that she and her husband left their home at 1am in the morning because they were being followed. The couple drove into the woods where they were attacked, she then said. Police officers then reported that the 21-year-old changed her story and said that they had left their home 12 hours later. According to the affidavit: 'She did not show any emotion and did not appear to be frantic or even openly concerned about the baby's well-being.' The family's pickup truck was found July 28 and Brian and Harper's bodies were found the next day. Preliminary autopsy reports said the child died of 'exposure and abandonment'. The cause of the husband's death was awaiting toxicology results. Bill James, the woman's lawyer, said he does not believe the woman is guilty. The family's pick-up truck is towed away to be examined from where it was found in the Ouachita Mountains last week. Floyd initially told officers the family was being chased but later believed the story was based on mutual hallucinations she was having with her husband . The Floyds, who lived in Greenwood, were seen together in a green pickup truck in Mansfield on Thursday evening and again the next morning in Yell County, between Moore's Chapel Cemetery and Lick Creek Recreation Area. According to an arrest report, Brian Floyd was previously questioned by police on July 20 after he falsely reported a burglary at his home. The report, seen by 5 News, reported that the 911 dispatcher told responding officers that the caller had a history of mental illness. Officers found Brian Floyd driving around his home in a 'manic state' and hallucinating, claiming that a woman had broken in and there was a police officer on the roof with a dog. Police reported no disturbances at the property. A family member told police he was having problems with his medication.","Brooke Sueann Floyd, 21, of Greenwood, Arkansas, surrendered to Yell County officers on Tuesday.

"By . Ben Spencer . People decide how trustworthy strangers are within the blink of an eye, psychologists have found, and it is all down to the shape of their face. We tend to judge someone with high eyebrows and prominent cheekbones to be more honest, while we are less likely to trust someone with a furrowed brow and sunken cheeks, researchers suggest. The findings give new weight to the principle that first impressions count. Scroll down for video . Samantha Armytage (left) and Lisa Wilkinson (right) would be seen as trustworthy people, according to the study, because they have high cheekbones and distinctive eyebrows . There is no evidence, however, that facial features demonstrate how honest someone really is– simply that they may be perceived to be trustworthy or untrustworthy depending on their looks. Psychologists from New York University found that a section of the brain decides a person’s trustworthiness even before we have consciously perceived who they are. The brain takes just 33 milliseconds - three hundredths of a second, or a tenth of a time it takes to blink - to decide whether someone is to be trusted. The study, published in the Journal of Neuroscience, suggests that our brains are set up to be instantly wary of people we decided we should not trust. Jonathan Freeman, assistant professor at New York University’s Department of Psychology, said: ‘Our findings suggest that the brain automatically responds to a face’s trustworthiness before it is even consciously perceived. ‘The results are consistent with an extensive body of research suggesting that we form spontaneous judgments of other people that can be largely outside awareness.’ Applying the findings to public figures, trusted individuals such as breakfast TV hosts Samantha Armytage and Lisa Wilkinson both have high cheekbones and eyebrows. Some might not agree but Tony Abbott would be deemed trustworthy unlike disgraced former US president Richard Nixon, one of the most famous liars in history . Wife killer Gerard Baden-Clay's eyebrows give him away as untrustworthy - as do jailed judge Marcus Einfeld's . Conversely, murderer Gerard Baden-Clay, who denied killing his wife Allison but was found guilty last month, and disgraced judge Marcus Einfeld, who was jailed for lying about being the driver of a car caught speeding, have sunken cheeks and furrowed brows. The New York research team presented a panel of ten volunteers with 300 computer generated faces, and asked them how trustworthy each was. Those faces with high cheekbones, high eyebrows and a smile were perceived to be the most honest. The scientists also presented the panel with real pictures of strangers, and the same facial attributes were found to be deemed as trustworthy. In a second set of experiments, a new set of 37 volunteers were presented with the ‘trustworthy’ and ‘untrustworthy’ images for a split second, while their brain activity was monitored. Angelina Jolie has trustworthy features, unlike Lara Bingle, who has faced court for numerous driving offences including driving while having suspended licence . The images were then immediately replaced with a neutral picture so the brain could no longer process the previous image. The scientists found that a region of the brain called the amygdala, which is vital in social and emotional behaviour, activated within 33 milliseconds even when the images were flashed up just momentarily. Faces with the high eyebrows and prominent cheekbones prompted activity in a different part of the amygdala than faces with furrowed brows and sunken cheeks. Dr Freeman said: ‘The findings suggest that we can assess another person’s trustworthiness from their face extremely rapidly and without conscious awareness, and that the amygdala plays an important role in this process. Hugh Jackman's features make him a housewife's favourite while former premier NSW Barry O'Farrell, who stood down over inaccurate evidence at a corruption inquiry, has sunken cheekbones . ‘One possibility is that faces that appear more untrustworthy and likely to inflict harm, or faces with stronger trustworthiness cues in general, are spontaneously tracked by the amygdala, so the amygdala could then quickly alter other brain processes and coordinate fast, appropriate responses to people --- approach or avoid. ‘This tracking would be especially pronounced for untrustworthy faces, who might inflict harm, which is consistent with what we found.’ 'There's no question that the facial appearance does affect how people see them. All day long I deal with people who say they're having cosmetic surgery to stay in the workplace longer because they're told they look tired, they look angry. They look like they're ready to retire when they're not,' Dr Daniel Lanzer, a Melbourne-based cosmetic surgeon, told Daily Mail Australia. 'It's a very quick impression… it's more a general feel that they get, the facial impression does make a difference.'","New York psychologists  found people judge trustworthiness on features .

"By . Ben Spencer . Teenagers who play violent computer games such as Grand Theft Auto are more likely to drink, smoke and have unprotected sex, psychologists have found. Games that glorify risky behaviour can encourage adolescents to become more rebellious and seek out thrills themselves, according to a new study. Scientists tracked 5,000 American teenagers for four years, and found a distinct correlation between the frequency that they played violent games and their behaviour. Teenagers who play violent computer games such as Grand Theft Auto (pictured) are more likely to drink, smoke and have unprotected sex, psychologists at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire have found . They discovered that those who often played adult-rated games were more likely to smoke, drink and become aggressive. The teenagers, who were aged 13 and ten months on average when the experiment started, were also more likely to go on, within four years, to display delinquent behaviour such as petty theft, starting fights or running away from home. Those who played violent games were also more likely to have first had sex at a younger age, more likely to have caught a sexually transmitted disease, and more likely to have had unprotected sex. The changes in behaviour, which were similar for boys and girls, increased in magnitude over time, the scientists found. Separate research published yesterday by Oxford University suggests that playing video games for less than an hour a day can lead to children becoming better adjusted. That study, published in the journal Pediatrics - which did not differentiate violent and non-violent games - found that young people who indulged in a little video game-playing were more sociable and more satisfied than those who had never played or who used video games for three hours or more. The study involved nearly 5,000 young people, half male and half female, drawn from a nationally representative study of UK households. Research Dr Andrew Przybylski said: 'These results support recent laboratory-based experiments that have identified the downsides to playing electronic games. However, high levels of video game-playing appear to be only weakly linked to children's behavioural problems in the real world.' Grand Theft Auto, a phenomenally successful game now in its fifth edition, involves stealing cars and driving at excessive speeds to evade police cars, with extra points for knocking over innocent bystanders or committing other crimes. Other violent games linked by the scientists to deviant behaviour include Manhunt - a psychological horror video game - and Spiderman 2, in which a comic-book superhero beats up villains. The scientists, from Dartmouth College in the US, said the violent characters in the video games appear to affect how adolescents think of themselves, with consequences for their alter ego in the real world. The study, published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, follows a 2012 Dartmouth study that suggested that such video games may lead teens to drive recklessly and drink and drive. Professor James Sargent, who worked on the study, said: ‘Up to now, studies of video games have focused primarily on their effects on aggression and violent behaviours. ‘This study is important because it is the first to suggest that possible effects of violent video games go well beyond violence to apply to substance use, risky driving and risk-taking sexual behaviour.’ His colleague Professor Jay Hull, quoting a 1960s American actor, said: ‘With respect to playing deviant video game characters, we feel it best to follow the admonition of Kurt Vonnegut in Mother Night: “We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be.”’ The authors suggested that changes in behaviour following protracted game play was down to alterations in the users’ personality, attitudes and values, making them more rebellious and thrill seeking. Other violent games linked by the scientists to deviant behaviour include Manhunt - a psychological horror video game - and Spiderman 2 (pictured), in which a comic-book superhero beats up villains . They wrote: ‘Across a wide variety of measures, mature-rated risk-glorifying gameplay was associated with deviant adolescent risk behaviour including excessive alcohol use, cigarette smoking, aggression, delinquency, and risky sex. The authors added: ‘Character-based video games provide an opportunity to practice being someone else. As a result, the behavioural consequences of playing such games are potentially much broader than the specific kinds of behaviours enacted in the game.’ Playing video games is not necessary all bad, however. Separate research published yesterday by Oxford University suggests that playing video games for less than an hour a day can lead to children becoming better adjusted. That study, published in the journal Pediatrics - which did not differentiate violent and non-violent games - found that young people who indulged in a little video game-playing were more sociable and more satisfied with their lives compared with those who had never played or who used video games for three hours or more.","This is according to a study of 5,000 US teenagers by Dartmouth College .

"By . Ben Spencer . Families should be banned from sending any food waste to landfill, according to a group of MPs. The controversial proposal, which would see all English homes forced to use ‘slop buckets’ to recycle kitchen scraps, was last night welcomed by green campaigners. Claiming its aim is to tackle a throwaway society, the Commons Environmental Audit Committee urged the Government to force councils to compost or re-use 100 per cent of food waste. Scroll down for video . The Commons Environmental Audit Committee wants to ban households from sending food waste to landfills . Labour MP . Joan Walley, who chairs the committee, said: ‘Food waste could be used . to produce biogas for energy and fertiliser for our farming system, yet . at the moment too much is thrown into landfill where its value is lost . and it produces climate-changing gases like methane.’ Nearly . 7.6million households in Britain – 27 per cent of all homes – already . have kitchen waste collections. But many are reluctant to use them, with . just 6 per cent of all food sent for recycling. They consider the food caddies unhygienic and messy, and too liable to be knocked over and targeted by vermin. Doretta . Cocks, founder of the Campaign for Weekly Waste Collection, said: ‘I . have a food caddy and I don’t use it – I don’t want it sitting in my . kitchen and I don’t want it sitting on the pavement. ‘They get full of maggots, they aren’t done up properly and they spill over on the street. ‘What I can’t see is how councils would enforce a rule like this – bin men aren’t going to go through your wheelie bin to check if there’s any food in there are they?’ The green lobby is keen to see the expansion of food collections and stricter rubbish rules. Friends of the Earth campaigner Julian Kirby said: ‘We live in a throwaway society we cannot sustain. With the enormous energy, water and land cost of producing food, particularly meat and dairy products, the committee is absolutely right to propose a ban on food waste to landfill.’ The committee’s report said: ‘Just 400,000 tonnes of food waste is separately collected for organic recycling in the UK out of the 7.2million tonnes thrown out by households every year – around 6 per cent. Instead this food waste could be collected separately and composted or used in anaerobic digesters to produce biogas and renewable energy and fertiliser.’ The report also criticised councils’ inconsistent recycling schemes, which it said should be standardised across England. It also proposed lower VAT on recycled products and longer warranties for consumer goods. But the report was dismissed by the Government as unrealistic.The Department for Communities and Local Government, which has authority over England’s councils, has tried to bring back weekly bin collections and simplify the recycling system. But it has faced resistance from authorities trying to cope with reduced costs while meeting tough EU recycling targets. Penny Mordaunt, who was appointed Communities Minister in last week’s reshuffle, said: ‘We don’t agree with these calls which would result in a proliferation of bins. ‘Rather than bullying families with unfair fines and confusing bin rules, councils should be providing regular and comprehensive rubbish and recycling collections, especially given people pay a lot of money in council tax.’ The Local Government Association, which represents councils, said: ‘There is a strong case for banning not just food from landfill, but also furniture, paints and textiles. This will help promote  a thriving reuse economy.’","Government urged to force councils to compost or re-use all food waste .

"By . Ben Spencer . Most of us know that feeling, the morning after the night before, when we wake up and say ‘never again’. Scientists have now discovered the area of the brain that gives us that hangover feeling - and suggest it is vital to stopping us drinking too much, too often. Neuroscientists at the University of Utah hope their discovery could lead to better treatments for alcoholics. The morning after: Neuroscientists at the University of Utah have narrowed down drinking to one area of the brain, the lateral habenula (file picture) Professor Sharif Taha, who led the study in rats, said: ‘In people, escalation of intake is what eventually separates a social drinker from someone who becomes an alcoholic.’ The research, published in the journal PLOS One, found that when a region of the brain called the lateral habenula is chronically inactivated in rats, they repeatedly drink to excess and are less able to learn from the experience. The scientists think the lateral habenula is activated by bad experiences, suggesting that when it is faulty or underactive people may be more inclined to repeat unhealthy behaviour. They gave rats access to a strong alcoholic drink over a period of several weeks. The animals which had a disabled lateral habenula drank more heavily than those which did not. Prof Taha added: ‘These rats drink amounts that are quite substantial. Legally they would be drunk if they were driving. ‘It’s the same kind of learning that mediates your response in food poisoning. You taste something and then you get sick, and then of course you avoid that food in future meals. ‘Yet rats with an inactivated lateral habenula sought out the juice more than control animals, even though it meant a repeat of the bad experience. ‘If we can understand the brain circuits that control sensitivity to alcohol’s aversive effects, then we can start to get a handle on who may become a problem drinker.’ Progress: The study suggests that when the circuits in the brain linked to alcohol's adverse effects are fully understood, a treatment for problem drinking can be developed (file picture) The group’s findings may help explain results from previous clinical investigations demonstrating that men who were less sensitive to the negative effects of alcohol drank more heavily, and were more likely to become problem drinkers later in life. The researchers think the lateral habenula likely works in one of two ways.. The region may regulate how badly an individual feels after over-drinking. Alternatively, it may control how well an individual learns from their bad experience. Co-author Andrew Haack added: ‘The way I look at it is the rewarding effects of drinking alcohol compete with the aversive effects. ‘When you take the aversive effects away, which is what we did when we inactivated the lateral habenula, the rewarding effects gain more purchase, and so it drives up drinking behaviour.’","Study by University of Utah suggests drinking is liked to an area of the brain .

"By . Ben Spencer . Men who have the snip increase their risk of suffering fatal prostate cancer, according to research. A study by Harvard scientists has found that those who have undergone a vasectomy could be 10 per cent more likely to be diagnosed with the disease. The research – the largest ever examination of the link between vasectomy and prostate cancer – involved data from 50,000 men whose health was tracked for 24 years. It found men who had the procedure were at an increased risk of getting an advanced or lethal form of the disease. A study by scientists at Havard University found having a vasectomy - a common form of contraception - is linked to a 10 per cent increased risk of developing the most lethal form of prostate cancer . Vasectomy is a common form of contraception and is more popular in Britain than almost anywhere else in the world. Some . 16 per cent of British men under 70 have had the operation. Prostate . cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer death among men. The . researchers, whose work was published in the Journal of Clinical . Oncology, analysed the health records of 49,405 American men who were . followed between 1986 and 2010. During that time, 6,023 cases of . prostate cancer were diagnosed, including 811 lethal cases. One in four . of the men in the study reported having a vasectomy. The researchers . found the men who had a vasectomy had a particularly raised risk of . developing the most aggressive forms of prostate cancer which are most . likely to kill. They had a 20 per cent raised risk of getting an advanced form of the disease and a 19 per cent raised risk of dying. The . authors emphasised that their study had only established a statistical . link between the operation and the disease – and they did not suggest . that vasectomies were directly causing the cancer. They concluded, . however, that urgent investigation was needed to establish if and why . the surgical procedure might be increasing the numbers of those with . cancer.

"By . Ben Spencer . Do you regularly have more than six drinks in one sitting? Or do you regret a drunken escapade that took place in the past year? If you have answered yes to either question, you may have a drink problem, according to research. A paper published by Leicester University advises that GPs should change the way they approach the subject of drinking in routine appointments . A paper published by Leicester University today advises that GPs change the way they approach drinking in routine appointments. The study found that a positive answer to either of these two questions can correctly identify those with alcohol problems in 87 per cent of cases. Although these are not strong enough results to immediately diagnose someone as an alcoholic, it is enough to effectively rule out those with no drink problem. And those who do pose a concern should be referred on for further questioning which can establish a more accurate picture. If the research, published today in the British Journal of General Practice, is taken on board it could spell an end to GPs asking how many units someone drinks a week. According to the research, GPs should instead ask, ‘Do you drink six or more drinks on one occasion once a month or more frequently?’ And follow it up with: ‘As a result of your drinking, did anything happen in the last year that you wish didn’t happen?’ If a patient answers positively to either question, a second set of four more detailed questions should be asked. The research team believe the findings could make it easier for GPs to identify drinking problems which would otherwise remain hidden. Patients’ answers could either rule out alcohol issues, or could bring to light potentially excessive or unsafe drinking habits. Dr Alex Mitchell, whose team analysed 17 previous alcohol studies involving 5,646 patients, said: ‘There is great time pressure in primary care. ‘GPs don’t have the time to ask a long list of questions for every single patient. The shorter the survey, the more acceptable it is for GP – but the greater the danger that it is inaccurate. ‘Our work shows that asking just two questions to patients works modestly well, but they need to be followed up by a longer questionnaire of four questions in those who initially screen positive.’ The researchers found that asking two questions could correctly identify those with alcohol problems in 87.2 per cent of cases, and correctly identify those who did not have alcohol problems in 79.8 per cent of cases. Dr Mitchell added: ‘At the moment, GPs ask patients about alcohol problems during about 3 per cent of consultations. ‘Routine screening using simple questions are an attempt to improve the situation.’","Research advises GPs to change approach to drinking in appointments .

"By . Jenny Hope . One in seven hospital beds is occupied by someone with diabetes – pushing the NHS bill to a record £10billion a year for treating the condition. Campaigners warn the 'eye-watering' cost of diabetes is going to get worse. The illness is strongly linked to lifestyle factors such as being overweight or obese, too little exercise and an unhealthy diet. 'Eye watering' cost: Diabetes is strongly linked to lifestyle factors such as being overweight or obese, too little exercise and an unhealthy diet (file picture) It already accounts for about 10 per cent of the total NHS budget, with most being spent on complications such as amputations and stroke. The costs will soar further over the next 20 years, when it is projected to soak up 17 per cent of the entire NHS budget, says a report. It will also increase the costs of social care, while a further £9billion is lost to the economy because of reduced productivity or those with diabetes being forced out of work altogether. Some 3.8million people in the UK have diabetes, including 600,000 who are unaware they have it. The total is predicted to rise to 5million by 2025. Nine in ten of those with diabetes have type-2, which occurs when the body gradually loses the ability to process blood sugar, leading to high levels which can damage organs and cause years of ill-health. A report by the charity Diabetes UK says the £10billion the NHS now spends on diabetes care is too often being spent badly. At present the NHS in England spends £2.3billion-£2.5billion on hospital inpatient care alone for diabetes, around 11 per cent of all expenditure on inpatient care . Those who are diagnosed late or do not receive timely care can find themselves having to spend extra days in hospital and suffering from kidney and nerve damage as a knock-on effect, running up huge bills for the NHS. The report says only one in ten of those newly diagnosed are offered education on managing their condition. Those patients have a longer length of stay in hospital – on average by three days – and regularly experience medical mistakes, especially medication errors, and avoidable deterioration in their condition. While vast amounts of money is being ploughed into diabetes treatment, it is too often used ineffectively, the charity warns. The report sets out a series of measures it claims will save the Health Service billions and improve care. It says that better education on how to manage the condition can save £2,200 a patient, while a reduction in foot amputations – a traumatic and expensive complication of diabetes – could save hundreds of millions of pounds a year. Diabetes can damage the eyes, heart, nerves, feet and kidneys, leaving many dependent on gruelling and costly dialysis machines. The vast majority of the £10billion – around 80 per cent – goes on treating complications that may have been prevented if the patient had received good care in the first place. Barbara Young, chief executive of Diabetes UK, said: 'The NHS is spending an eye-watering amount on diabetes but the money isn't being used effectively, which is running up a huge bill for the future. This report shows how by dealing with problems early, such as by improved inpatient care and effective care planning, costs could be greatly reduced and more people would live longer and healthier lives. 'Too often, the focus is on cutting costs in the short-term such as by cutting diabetes specialist nurses, restricting access to blood glucose test strips and poorly planned transferrals to primary care. But this is making it difficult for those with diabetes to manage the condition and is offering poor value for money for taxpayers.' At present the NHS in England spends £2.3billion-£2.5billion on hospital inpatient care alone for diabetes, around 11 per cent of all expenditure on inpatient care. With the number of patients with diabetes projected to rise to 5million by 2025, Diabetes UK says costs will go up to £17billion in 2035/36 if current levels of obesity and overweight continue. Last night Karen Addington, chief executive of JDRF, the type-1 diabetes charity, said: 'Better NHS care for all those with types-1 and 2 diabetes is vital and we welcome Diabetes UK's work to draw attention to this serious issue. 'It is also essential that the Government invests more into type-1 diabetes research, to reduce the economic costs to the NHS, improve the lives of the 400,000 people in the UK living with type-1 diabetes and ultimately find the cure.'","Campaigners warn 'eye-watering' cost of diabetes is getting worse .

"By . Ben Spencer . and Sarah Griffiths . It is Britain’s most famous murder mystery and a puzzle that has occupied criminologists for more than a century. But modern crime experts think they have finally decoded part of the Jack the Ripper conundrum using a computer algorithm - and suggest detectives may have been very close to solving the murders at the time. Dr Kim Rossmo, a former Canadian police officer who has pioneered the use of geographical profiling, thinks he has pinpointed the very street where the Ripper lived while he was terrorising London in the autumn of 1888. Warning: Graphic content . A former Canadian police officer who pioneered the use of geographical profiling, thinks the Ripper lived on Flower and Dean Street in Whitechapel, East London. The bustling street is pictured here in 1902 . Using mathematical computer models which take the murderer’s known movements and calculate his likely geographical base, Dr Rossmo has worked out that the killer probably lived in Flower and Dean Street. It was part of a slum in Whitechapel, East London. 'This was the vice-ridden neighbourhood that East End social reformers referred to as the “wicked quarter-mile,""' Dr Rossmo said. All five victims lived in doss houses within 200 yards (183 metres) of the road and frequented the nearby Ten Bells Pub at Spitalfields Market. The street was destroyed in the Blitz. Using mathematical computer models which take the murderer’s known movements and calculate his likely geographical base, Dr Rossmo has worked out that the killer probably lived in Flower and Dean Street, a slum area in the Whitechapel area of East London. In 1888, detectives conducted door-to-door inquiries along Flower and Dean Street in the wake of the five murders, but came up with nothing and turned their attention to other areas. Dr Rossmo, speaking at the Cheltenham Science Festival yesterday, said that each of the five victims had lived in doss houses within 200 yards (183 metres) of the road and had each frequented the Ten Bells Pub at Spitalfields Market, which was close by. The criminologist, whose geographical profiling techniques are now used by police forces around the world, said: ‘Flower and Dean Street was destroyed in the Blitz and no longer exists as it used to. But in 1888 it lay between Commercial Street to the west and Brick Lane to the east, north of Whitechapel Road. Flower and Dean Street (marked) was destroyed in the Blitz. But in 1888 it lay between Commercial Street to the west and Brick Lane to the east, north of Whitechapel Road. This map also reveals the locations of each victim's murder and the Ten Bells pub, believed to be where Jack the Ripper used to frequent . Speaking at the Cheltenham Science Festival yesterday, Dr Rossmo said that each of the five victims had lived in doss houses within 200 yards of the road and had each frequented the Ten Bells Pub at Spitalfields Market, which was close by (pictured). The pub as it appeared in 2013 is shown . Jack the Ripper murdered five victims in 1888. ‘During the time of the Whitechapel murders it contained several doss houses. ‘This was the vice-ridden neighbourhood that East End social reformers referred to as the “wicked quarter-mile”.’ Using the sites of each of the murders and the location of a scrap of bloody clothing found nearby, Dr Rossmo used an algorithm to calculate the likely routes the killer had taken on the days of each murder and his most probable base. He found that Flower and Dean Street is likely to have been his home, and at the very least would have been a frequent haunt. Dr Rossmo, who helped West Yorkshire Police capture and prosecute serial rapist Clive Barwell in the 1990s, said: ‘I would be very surprised indeed if the Ripper had not had some involvement with Flower and Dean Street. He might have lived there, drank there, picked up prostitutes there, he might have had a relative there. There is a high chance it was within his area of activity.’ Using the sites of the murders . and the location of a scrap of bloody clothing found nearby, Dr Rossmo . used an algorithm to calculate the likely routes the killer had taken on . the days of each murder and his most probable base. An image of victim Elizabeth Stride is pictured left, and a letter purporting to be from the Ripper (right) He said police at the time and ‘Ripperologists’ since had wrongly built their investigations around their suspects, rather than strictly following the evidence. ‘This is one of the biggest cause of wrongful convictions – choosing an early suspect and building a case around that. You need to follow the evidence.’ But he said the killer, who mutilated his five female victims after strangling them, will now almost certainly never be identified. ‘The only way we could find who the Ripper is now is if there is a piece of evidence squirrelled away in the Scotland Yard files, which we might get a piece of DNA from. You would then need to find a relative to compare it to, it is a very long shot.’ He said the Ripper probably died, was taken into a mental asylum or was imprisoned for another crime – and dismissed theories that suggest the killer was linked to the Royal Family. Using mathematical computer models which take the murderer's known movements and calculate his likely geographical base, Dr Rossmo has worked out that the killer probably lived in Flower and Dean Street, a slum area in the Whitechapel area of East London. A still from the 1959 film Jack The Ripper is pictured . ‘This man was almost certainly anonymous. His psychological profile suggests he was poor, he lived or worked in Whitechapel and he had a menial job. He was not an aristocrat.’ Dr Rossmo, who started his career as a police officer with Vancouver Police and is now based at the criminal justice department at Texas State University, is working with British academics to apply his geographical profiling techniques to disciplines of healthcare and wildlife conservation. Dr Steven Le Comber, a biological mathematician at Queen Mary University in London, has refined Dr Rossmo’s computer model to track populations of invasive species, outbreaks of infectious diseases and even mosquito breeding grounds. He told the Cheltenham audience: ‘This is genuinely exciting – using these techniques can really make a difference for public health.’ Detectives investigating crimes including gruesome murders may have a new tool in their crime fighting kit soon as Dutch forensic experts have discovered how to accurately date fingerprints. They think their innovation could let police date crime scene prints from years ago. ‘It's not quite the Holy Grail of fingerprinting, but it's a very important discovery,’ Marcel de Puit, a fingerprint researcher at the Dutch Forensic Institute (NFI), told AFP. ‘Being able to date the prints means you can determine when a potential suspect was at the crime scene or which fingerprints are relevant for the investigation.’ Fingerprints leave nearly-unique marks on a surface that can be copied and compared to a database to identify a suspect - a police technique that rose to prominence in the early 1900s. The prints themselves are made up of sweat and grease, including a complex mix of cholesterol, amino acids and proteins. ‘The chemicals in these fingerprints can be analysed. Some disappear over time and it's the relative proportions of these chemicals that allow us to date a fingerprint,’ De Puit said. Previous attempts to crack the formula for dating fingerprints failed because they focused on the amounts of chemicals, rather than their relative proportions. Taking into account the temperature of the original prints' surroundings, which affects the speed of deterioration, forensic experts can now date fingerprints to within ‘one or two days’. The new technique needs to be extensively tested on real crimes scenes, leading to the creation of a database, before it can be used in prosecutions.","A former Canadian police officer who pioneered the use of geographical profiling thinks the Jack the Ripper lived on Flower and Dean Street .

"By . Ben Spencer . Young people too willingly surrender their privacy to Google and Facebook, a leading scientist warned yesterday. Noel Sharkey, a professor of artificial intelligence and robotics at Sheffield University, said that older people were more cautious with their personal data. Addressing the Cheltenham Science Festival, he said: ‘I’m 65, I don’t want to be targeted. I am very uncomfortable with it. It seems to me our privacy is gradually being violated and eroded without us noticing. Young people seem happy to surrender their priivacy to companies like Google . The Facebook website contains millions of pieces of information about people that they have willingly given . ‘I am part of the generation which all read 1984 – I think we are less happy about giving up our privacy. ‘But the younger generation aren’t really thinking about it. The services that Google and Facebook give us are so good that people are willing to trade off their privacy for them.’ He said Google’s recording of all our online activities meant it knew far too much about us. He added: ‘At the moment it doesn’t seem harmful. But because governments can get hold of this information, they can monitor you, things might change quite dramatically.’ Google has invested billions of pounds buying up cutting-edge technologies which will increase their access to people’s information. The internet giant recently paid £1.9billion for Nest Labs, a firm which makes internet–connected heating systems, allowing people to control their thermostats from afar. Supporters argue that having greater control over home applications – which may soon include fridges that automatically reorder when you run out of food and lighting systems that turn on when they sense your approach – can only benefit consumers. But connecting more things to the internet enables large firms to collect more and more data.Another recent Google purchase is Deep-Mind, a British artificial intelligence firm which specialises in quickly building up a profile of an individual based on their internet activity.

"By . Ben Spencer . Curvy: Full-figured women - particularly those with large breasts - were more attractive to men with an empty stomach . Men prefer voluptuous women when they are hungry – while peckish women are more attracted to muscular men, psychologists have found. The phenomenon is rooted in an ancient evolutionary instinct that prioritises people who are seen as having better access to food. The researchers believe a woman’s shape – particularly her chest size – is seen to indicate her level of fat reserves. In their study of 124 men who were shown images of five different body shapes, those who were hungry rated women with larger chests as significantly more attractive. Dr Viren Swami of London’s University of Westminster said other studies have shown women find muscular men more attractive when they themselves want food. He said: ‘If a man is hungry, they prefer slightly larger breasts sizes and slightly larger woman. If a women is hungry they prefer more muscular men. ‘These are clues about resources. If you are hungry you want resources and a partner who has resources. Someone who is heavier has access to food.’ Psychologists think that breast size may indicate fat reserves, which in turn indicates access to resources. Around half of the men in the study had not eaten for six hours, while the rest had full stomachs. After being shown images of five different body shapes, the hungry group rated women with larger breasts as significantly more attractive. A second set of tests found the less money a man had, the more he liked curvy women. Dr Swami said other studies have shown women find muscular men more attractive when they’re hungry. Professor Gareth Leng, of Edinburgh University, said at Cheltenham Science Festival that the link between hunger and attraction may be down to oxytocin – a hormone produced during childbirth, breastfeeding and lovemaking. Oxytocin, which is known as the ‘love hormone’, boosts libido but also suppresses hunger. Hunger and sex are basic drives but it means we cannot pursue both at the same time. Professor Leng said the patterns that Dr Swami has established may be caused by the oxytocin mechanism, although more research is needed to establish a direct link. Women with big busts and hips have historically proved popular in periods of economic depression, which psychologists think is because larger women communicate strength, control and wealth in tough times. Linked to fear: Dr Viren Swami said people who are afraid feel more attracted to those around them - which could explain infatuations with one's ski instructor . Dr Swami also said that people find those around them more attractive when they are afraid. If he is right, it may mean that taking a prospective lover to a scary movie or on a funfair rollercoaster is a perfect idea for a date. It also may explain why people on holiday often fall for their ski instructor. But he said the link between fear and attraction is an evolutionary mistake. A quickening pulse, dilating pupils and clammy skin – the body’s reaction to adrenaline – can be mistaken by the body for sexual attraction. ‘We misinterpret our arousal,’ he said. ‘It is an error of presumption.'","Researchers believe access to food can help determine attractiveness .

"By . Jenny Hope . Tens of thousands of people are putting themselves at risk of stroke by dismissing early warning signs as a ‘funny turn’, experts say. Mini-strokes – also known as transient ischaemic attacks (TIA) – are often a precursor to a potentially fatal major stroke. Common symptoms such as arm weakness, slurred speech and blurred vision are often written off by sufferers as sciatica or a migraine. Patients often dismiss symptoms such as arm weakness, slurred speech and blurred vision as having a 'funny turn' (picture posed by models) However, one in 12 people who have a TIA will go on to suffer a full-blown stroke within a week. Every year, 46,000 people in Britain have a mini-stroke for the first time. If these were treated properly, around 10,000 strokes a year could be prevented and the NHS could save more than £200million, according to the Stroke Association’s report, Not Just A Funny Turn. Jon Barrick, chief executive of the Stroke Association, said: ‘The greatest risk of having a major stroke is within the first few days after a mini-stroke. However, for many people it doesn’t feel like an emergency because the symptoms are brief. ‘Too many mini-stroke patients delay calling 999 when their symptoms start and instead book a GP appointment or visit their optician because of their visual symptoms.’ The charity’s report found that one in three people who had a mini-stroke in the past five years thought it was just a ‘funny turn’. Only one in five rang 999 and almost half said the symptoms did not feel like an emergency. But one in five then went on to have a stroke. What to watch for . The charity questioned 670 people for the report, which was supported by Legal & General. And a quarter of those surveyed said healthcare professionals had not recognised the symptoms as those of a TIA. More than a fifth said they were not given any information about lifestyle changes they needed to make to prevent a stroke. Strokes can affect even the seemingly fit and healthy, as father of four Simon Bird, 53, discovered. He had a TIA one evening in October 2011. He said: ‘I was clearing the dishes away after dinner with my wife, Tricia, when I felt a sudden numbness in my left arm and couldn’t get my words out. I had to sit down. But it was over within about 30 seconds.’ Mr Bird was taken to hospital, where a specialist confirmed he had had a mini-stroke. It was a huge shock, given his age and healthy lifestyle. ‘I had lost weight, my diet was good and I was in training for a 100km cycle ride,’ he said. The mini-stroke was caused by atrial fibrillation, a condition which affects heart rhythm and increases risk of blood clots, which in turn raises risk of stroke and TIA. Mr Bird was put on medication to manage the condition and prevent a stroke. ‘I dread to think what could have happened if I had ignored it and just put it down to a “funny turn”.’","Better awareness of symptoms could prevent 10,000 stroke a year .

"By . Jenny Hope . Breast cancer sufferers are to be denied a new 'wonder' drug that has been proven to extend life by six months. Rationing watchdog NICE is set to block routine use of the medicine on the NHS for those with the most aggressive form of the disease on the grounds of cost. Known as Kadcyla or T-DM1, it is the first treatment that can destroy cancerous cells while sparing healthy tissue. Breast cancer victims have been denied new 'wonder' drug that can extend life by six months. Pictured here is a patient having a breast scan in hospital . As a result, it dramatically reduces the traumatic side-effects usually associated with chemotherapy, including hair loss. Up to 1,500 women a year in Britain with advanced HER-2 positive breast cancer could benefit. The medicine, which costs £6,000 a month, will be the eighth breast cancer treatment turned down by NICE because of cost since 2011. It says the £90,000 bill for treating a patient over 15 months is simply too great. NICE's decision was attacked by a cancer sufferer who claims it has extended her life by more than two years. Kim Mawby, 44, who was given six months to live in 2011, said she is now living a normal life with her partner and two sons, taking holidays and working part time. 'It's a wonder drug as far as I'm concerned,' she said. 'You wouldn't know that I am ill. I'm devastated to think that women in my position might be denied it in future.' Kadcyla combines Herceptin, another breast cancer drug, with a potent chemotherapy agent which acts only when it reaches cancer cells. It blocks signals that encourage the cancer to spread, and breaches the tumour's outer defences, allowing it to be destroyed from within. Because its action is so precise, healthy tissue is spared from unnecessary damage, while the cancer is delayed from returning and side-effects are significantly reduced.  Trial results show it provides on average six months' extra life, but some women having once-monthly infusions are living far longer. Professor Paul Ellis, professor of cancer medicine at King's College London and lead triallist for the drug in the UK, said the NICE draft guidance was a 'huge blow' because it could revolutionise cancer care. 'For the first time in 20 years as a consultant I'm seeing people with advanced disease taking an effective drug with little toxicity,' he said. NICE is currently consulting  on draft guidance recommending the drug is not transferred to the  NHS budget. Whatever the outcome, patients in England can apply to get it from the Cancer Drugs Fund, set up to fund medicines not routinely available on the NHS. But the fund does not operate elsewhere in the UK, and it is due to be wound up in 2016. Dr Caitlin Palframan, of charity Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said: 'The drug appraisal process in England, and the cost of drugs, must change if prospects for patients are going to improve.' Sir Andrew Dillon, NICE chief executive, said he hoped Roche, which makes the drug, would use the consultation period to consider if there was more it could do. He said: 'We had hoped Roche would have recognised the challenge the NHS faces in managing the adoption of expensive new treatments by reducing the cost of Kadcyla to the NHS.'","NICE is set to block routine use of the medicine on the NHS .

"By . Mail On Sunday Reporter . Singing their praises: Sir Tim Rice, lyricist, has dontated a whopping £7,500 to UKIP, after be announced he believed they should be 'free from Europe' UKIP’s campaign to win this year’s European elections received a boost last night with the news  that music impresario Sir Tim Rice has donated cash to the anti-Brussels party. The Oscar-winning lyricist, a former donor to the Conservative Party, believes Britain should be ‘free from Europe’ and is ‘intrigued’ by the rise in UKIP’s popularity, according to reports. Sir Tim, the man behind hits such as Jesus Christ Superstar and Evita, is said to have donated up to £7,500 to UKIP last year after meeting party treasurer Stuart Wheeler for lunch. But the gesture has not been made public until now as the amount given fell below the minimum donation threshold which has to be declared under Electoral Commission rules. UKIP leader Nigel Farage is aiming to cause a political earthquake in the May elections for the European Parliament by steering his party to the top of the polls and, in doing so, push David Cameron’s Tories into a humiliating third place. But earlier this month, UKIP showed it was not just a threat to the Conservative Party by coming second in the parliamentary by-election for the Labour seat of Wythenshawe and Sale East in Manchester. Mr Farage’s party came fifth in the constituency at the 2010 General Election. Sir Rice was formerly a Tory supporter, but has since gone over to the side of Farage's UKIP because of their stance on key issues . Mr Wheeler was quoted as saying: ‘I’m glad to confirm that Tim Rice has actually been a donor to UKIP.  It was about a year ago.’ Sir Tim was once a high-profile Tory supporter, but last year he  said he might no longer vote for them because of Mr Cameron’s enthusiasm for ‘hideous’ wind farms.","Sir Time Rice was formerly a Tory supporter, but has since changed sides .

He has been on United's books since the age of nine and wants to force his way into the first team - and represent England too. Speaking about his record run, Williams told the Manchester Evening News: 'I didn't know I had beaten the record until the next day at school when my teacher told me. 'It was just a school sports day so we all had to run.' After seeing his 25-year-old record smashed, Campbell said: 'I've always said anyone who can run under 11 seconds has got a lot of natural speed, it shows that he's got massive ability. I wish him all the best.' Despite his sprinting prowess, Williams is fully focused on carving a career for himself in the professional game - especially after watching seeing Ryan Giggs become caretaker manager at the end of last season. He added: 'Ryan Giggs is my hero I suppose because he has stayed with the club, and when he was acting manager he gave young players a chance.' Dreams: Williams is aiming to become a regular for Manchester United and England .

"By . Jenny Hope . Young women who go through the menopause have a higher risk of suffering 'brain fog', warn researchers . Young women who go through the menopause have a higher risk of suffering ‘brain fog’, warn researchers. A study shows they appear to have more trouble with many cognitive functions including memory and coordination. In the UK, the average age of the menopause is 51 years, when women’s ovaries run out of eggs and they can no longer have children. A British study last year found one in 20 women had gone through an early menopause, which can occur from the teens onwards. There may be no medical reason, or it may be caused by medical treatment including hysterectomy. The loss of oestrogen means women lose their natural protection against heart disease and thinning bones. But premature menopause may have long-term deleterious effects on brain function, says a new study in BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology. Almost 5,000 post-menopausal women were given cognitive tests at the start of the study and then after two, four and seven years. Around 7.6 per cent of the women in the study had a premature menopause and a further 13 per cent had an early menopause between 41 and 45 years. Over a fifth of the women used hormone treatment (HRT) during the menopause. In comparison to women going through the menopause after 50, those with a premature menopause did worse on a range of brain function tests. They were 40 per cent more likely to perform badly in verbal fluency and visual memory tests. They were also 35 per cent more at risk of a decline in psychomotor speed, the coordination between the brain and the muscles that brings about movement, and overall cognitive function over 7 years. Premature menopause may have long-term deleterious effects on brain function, says a new study in BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology . There was no greater risk of dementia. HRT to alleviate the effects of premature menopause helped visual memory, but could increase the risk of poor verbal fluency. Study leader Dr Joanne Ryan at the Hospital La Colombiere, Montpellier, said ‘Both premature surgical menopause and premature ovarian failure, were associated with long-term negative effects on cognitive function, which are not entirely offset by menopausal hormone treatment.’ Pierre Martin Hirsch, BJOG deputy editor-in-chief said ‘With the ageing population it is important to have a better understanding of the long term effects of a premature menopause on later-life cognitive function and the potential benefit from using menopausal hormone treatment. ‘This study adds to the existing evidence base to suggest premature menopause can have a significant impact on cognitive function in later life which healthcare professionals must be aware of.’","Average age of the menopause is 51 , when women run out of eggs .

Cod Plus in Brighton was investigated by council officials who found rat droppings, congealed food and a 'smelly' box of sewage-like liquid at shop following the complaint from a member of the public. Owner Asif Javaid was fined £1,000 and ordered to pay a £100 victim surcharge by magistrates for the 'shocking' state of the premises. A brown box of 'smelly' fluid was one of several findings made by council officials at Cod Plus takeaway . Built-up grease and congealed food debris was also found at the city centre shop by Brighton and Hove Council officials . Officers first visited the shop last September to investigate the cockroach allegation. There, they found rat droppings where food was kept and near the rubbish bins. Despite warnings, more were found on a second visit to the site as was congealed fat on cooking appliances and on the inside of the microwave. Two adults rats had also been caught in traps, Brighton Magistrates' Court heard. Javaid was found guilty of failing to have adequate procedures in place to control pests, failing to keep the premises clean and in good repair and condition, and failing to ensure that food handlers were supervised, instructed or trained in food hygeine matters. He was found not guilty of a fourth charge of failing to put in place, implement and maintain permanent procedures based on Hazard Anslysis and Critical Control Points principles, a Brighton and Hove Council spokesman said. Old food and grease in the takeaway's microwave was discovered during an investigation last September . Old and 'fresh' rat droppings were also found in the shop, as well as two 'adult rats' which were caught in traps .

'Since this case was reported my family has been subjected to all kinds of abuse,' the 43-year-old said. Deputy Chair of Environment, Sustainability and Transport Committee, Councillor Lizzie Deane said: 'Prosecution is always the last resort, and while we are appalled to hear Mr Javaid’s claims of racial abuse following last year’s court hearing, we will continue to take the necessary steps to ensure that residents and visitors can eat safely in our city.'

Ryoji Ikeda is Japan's leading electronic composer and visual artist. Based in Paris, he has produced 13 albums and countless compilations in addition to putting on visual art exhibitions across the world. Ikeda has also performed at musical festivals and concerts throughout Europe and Japan. The artist claims to draw on the 'essential characteristics of sound itself and that of visuals as light by means of both mathematical precision and mathematical aesthetics.' Handpicked by the Mayor of London's office and the 14-18 Now, the Centenary Art Commission, to work on the piece, Ikeda is considered one of the few artists in the world who successfully creates art through both light and sound. A spokesman for ArtAngel, who were initially approached to produce a light installation to mark the centenary, said: 'Our directors were aware of the artist's work and when approached and asked what we thought we should do we suggested Spectra.' The installation has appeared in other cities in the world such as Hobart in Tasmania, but in different contexts, she added. 'It works well with the lights out initiative. The piece has been used before but never in a memorial context.' The lights' square bases are 75cm and are thereofre easily transported. Ikeda began constructing the grid at Victoria Tower Gardens on July 27, a week before the finished spectacle was unveiled to the public. James Lingwood and Michael Morris, Artangel Co-Directors, said: 'Spectra is an artwork sculpted in sound and light, a sublime combination of mathematics and architecture. 'Ryoji Ikeda offers us an open invitation to look and listen and wonder.' Jenny Waldman, Director of 14-18 NOW said: 'This beautiful artwork is a symbol of hope. 'At this UK-wide moment of commemoration, it is a testament to the endurance of the human spirit in adversity.'","Spectra is made of 49 individual spotlights which shoot 15 miles into the sky from Victoria Tower Gardens in London .

"By . Jennifer Smith . A police force spent £11million of taxpayers' money on a new headquarters which they never moved in to and have now sold at a loss, it has emerged. Hampshire Constabulary bought the industrial property in 2008 for £9.6million pounds after deeming their former headquarters in Winchester 'unfit for purpose'. But, after five years and an additional £1.8million, the force sold the property at Alpha Park near Eastleigh, Hampshire, at a loss. The unit at Alpha Park has been sold at a loss after Hampshire Constabulary spent £9.6million buying it in 2008 . A Hampshire Police Federation spokesman described the purchase and sale of the property as 'very embarrassing' The exact figure of the sale is unknown, though Hampshire Police sources revealed it was less than the sum paid for the property in 2008. The sale comes after a review revealed the project would cost another £13.75million to complete to the required standard. Today Hampshire's Police and Crime commissioner Simon Hayes said: 'We have agreed a price with a purchaser and Alpha Park has been sold subject to a survey. 'We always knew, and I said when I launched the new estates strategy, that we were going to sell it at less than we have purchased it all those years ago. 'But the important thing is we get as much for it as we can in the current market. 'The decision I had to make was how long do we hold on to it because it’s costing us money just to keep the dust off it and keep it secure. 'That was a decision I had to make and I felt that the offer we have got is a good one.' The Chairman of Hampshire Police Federation today described the sale as 'very embarassing' for the force. John Apter said: 'This has drawn a line under a very embarrassing period for the constabulary. 'Most people I speak to are still baffled by the decision to buy Alpha Park in the first place.' He added: 'Mr Hayes must promise us as a constabulary and also the taxpayer that this will never happen again. The force bought the Alpha Park property after deeming its former headquarters in Winchester (pictured) unfit for purpose . 'It’s been a bit of a festering sore but it is good to move on. The police buildings in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight have not been a top priority for many, many years. 'What is refreshing is there now appears to be a light at the end of a very long tunnel.' The Audit Commission has scrutinised the Hampshire Police Authority’s decision to buy Alpha Park in 2008, and concluded that the purchase was not unreasonable. A Hampshire Constabulary spokesman said the money received from the sale of Alpha Park will be go back into proposals for revamping the force’s estates. Hampshire Constabulary recently revealed 448 officers and 436 staff jobs were to be cut after being told to save £55million in Government cuts.","Hampshire Constabulary bought the property for £9.6million in 2008 .

"By . Jennifer Smith . A French Jew who was wrongly executed for blood libel almost 350 years ago has been exonerated of the crime and declared a martyr. Raphael Levy was burned at the stake in 1670 after being accused of killing a three-year-old Christian and using their blood for religious rituals. But on Sunday, more than three decades after his death, officials in Glatigny, Moselle, dedicated a plaque to the man's memory, describing him as a 'martyr accused of a crime he did not commit.' Raphael Levy was burned at the stake in the same way women accused of witchcraft were killed in the 1600s (pictured) The ceremony in France was attended by more than 100 people, including the president of the Consistoire – the French Jewish community’s organization responsible for religious services, the Times of Israel reports. Speaking at the event, the mayor of Glatigny, Victor Stallone said: 'Today we are back to square one, we are reconciled, we resume normal relations with the Jewish community. 'Glatigny was cursed since that time because of a principled prohibition decided upon by the Jewish community.' The village was considered cursed after the incident in 1670, with Jewish travellers prohibited from spending the night there in its wake. Blood libel allegations originate in the Middle Ages when Jews were falsely accused of murdering children for ritual purposes. They were largely spread to justify violence against Jews, and often used to explain mysterious deaths of children. The first known accusation of blood libel was in England in the 12th century, when a child called William of Norwich was found dead with what looked like horn piercings in his head. Centuries later, the Nazis often spread propaganda alleging ritual murder at the hands of Jews to justify their violent behaviour towards them.","Raphael Levy was burned at the stake after being accused of killing a child .

"By . Jennifer Smith . A furious grandfather drove his Jeep into the home of noisy neighbours after becoming fed up with the way they allegedly 'terrorised' his daughter, a court heard. Paul Kingsman, 52, ploughed into the council house in Peterborough, yelling: 'That's how you bang on a f***ing wall', it was alleged. The grandfather reportedly banged on windows at Charlene Vernall's home, warning her she had three minutes to vacate before reversing his 4x4 vehicle though the house's front wall. Paul Kinsgman drove his Jeep into Charlene Vernall's house after his daughter complained the woman was making too much noise . He pleaded guilty to affray, criminal damage and dangerous driving but not guilty to agtravated damage reckless to endanger life. Peterborough Crown Court heard how the man drove himself home after the incident in Tansor Garth, Peterborough. A reported £14,000 worth of damage was caused to the house which now has a gaping hole in it. The court heard how Miss Vernall reported Mr Kingsman's daughter, Sophie, to the RSPCA after allegedly leaving her unfed dog in the snow. She then allegedly held parties until 5am which kept Sophie and her son awake all night. Speaking in court, the 23-year-old said: 'It was so loud I couldn’t watch TV and my stairs were shaking. It used . to keep my baby son awake all night. 'Often it went on until 5 in the . morning and I could hear the children next door crying too. 'They used to kick my fence late at night. Once they started sort of roaring, like lions, through my walls. 'I . could hear men threatening to come round and punch me in the face. I . could hear people saying they needed to go and get weapons. Paul Kingsman (left) said he didn't plan on destroying the house's wall and that he warned the occupants to get out before ramming his vehicle into it to stick up for his daughter Sophie (right) Mr Kingsman said he responded in the way he did as he claimed police did not answer his daughter's pleas for help . 'I was always frightened.' The young mother said she reported her neighbour's behavior to the police and her housing association but claimed nothing was done to solve the problem. On the day in question, Sophie phoned her father while he was out shopping to tell him she was still having problems with Miss Vernall who is pregnant with her fourth child. 'I took the view no one else was going to stop it. I thought if I damage that property no one could live there,' he said. ‘I . lined my car up, drove through the fence and stopped. I got out and . banged the door and the window and was shouting “You’ve got three . minutes to get out”. 'Then I rammed the house in. When I got out I shouted: “That’s how you bang on a f***ing wall.”' The 52-year-old said he thought the family would be forced out of the property if he made it unstable, but insisted he had not meant to destroy it completely. Charlene Vernall, 24, lives at the property with her children. Speaking after Mr Kingsman's trial, she said she would have been quieter if the man had asked . Sophie’s older sister Sarah Kingsman, 25, was in her sister’s house picking up her things at the time of the incident. She described how she heard screaming, and looked out to see three terrified girls climbing out the back kitchen window. 'We are a close family. I asked him “What have you done?""' she said. “He said: ""They can’t hurt her anymore."" Mr Kingsman allegedly told his daughter he 'couldn't let them do it anymore,' and that the police had ignored her pleas for help. When offivers arrived at his house that afternoon, they found his car bonnet was crushed in with bits of brick and broken glass hanging off, the court heard. On his way to the police station, the grandfather allegedly said: 'I would have done it with a club hammer - but that would have taken longer.' Speaking after the trial, Miss Verball said: 'I was in my front room watching Jeremy Kyle with a cup of tea and a fag. 'Then this guy started banging on my door shouting: “Come on out here or I’m coming in!’ 'Then we heard a car revving outside - and the next thing I knew there was a Land Rover in my living room. 'All I remember is seeing the sofa following me as I ran away and all the bricks falling down. 'I don’t think that guy can be normal. If he’d knocked on the door and shouted at me I might have quietened down a bit.' Kingsman is due to be sentenced at Peterborough Crown Court on February 6.

George Fessey admitted Grievous Bodily Harm without intent and was sentenced to two years in prison after throwing the teenager to the ground 'like a WWE wrestler' A teenager had to have a titanium plate fitted in his face and be treated for epilepsy after a thug bouncer threw his body to the ground 'like a ragdoll' in a vicious attack outside a nightclub. Rory Davis had been enjoying a night out with his friends before the incident at After Dark nightclub in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, in December 2012 . The 19-year-old was left with a brain haemorrhage and hole in his skull after 17-stone George Fessey slammed his body to the pavement 'like a WWE wrestler,' a court heard. Rory, now 21, was rushed to hospital after cracking the left side of his head against the pavement. He now suffers slurred speech and receives medication for epilepsy. Fessey was found innocent of causing Grievous Bodily Harm (GBH) with intent in a trial last year. But the the 25-year-old was sentenced to two years in prison yesterday after having previously admitted causing GBH without intent. Speaking during his trial last year, Fessey told Nottingham Crown Court: 'I was intending just to put him to the floor and restrain him - it went horribly wrong.' After yesterday's hearing, Detective Inspector Phil Sims said: 'This was a classic case of adrenaline-fuelled violence and bravado, . leading to a massive over-reaction and use of unnecessary force by one . man against another who was half his size. 'It’s never a fair fight between someone who can lift a person above his head and body-slam him to the ground. 'George . Fessey left his victim in the absolute lowest level of consciousness . before death, he’s fortunate to have come out of it as well as he has. 'Not . only was it a traumatic, life-altering ordeal for the victim, there . were also a number of people who witnessed this, frankly . stomach-churning, incident. 'It’s fair to say it brought an abrupt end to their festive celebrations. 'Doormen are supposed to ensure the safety of customers and diffuse potentially problematic and violent situations. The incident took place during a festive night out on Leeming Street in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, (pictured)  in 2012 . Fessey was found innocent of Grievous Bodily Harm with intent at Nottingham Crown Court last year, though was sentenced to two years imprisonment yesterday . 'Fessey did the opposite. He was the problem, failing to see the boundaries of reasonable action. 'We patrol Mansfield town centre as a matter of course during the evenings and had officers nearby that night. 'If Fessey had simply called us instead of taking the law into his own hands this whole incident could have been avoided.' Speaking after the incident, Rory said: 'I have had a year prison sentence waiting to get my plate fitted - he will get less prison time than me. 'It hard to say what his intent was - only he knows that.'","Rory Davis was thrown to the ground 'like a rag doll' by 17-stone bouncer .

"By . Jennifer Smith . Forward-thinking engineers in China are the first in the country to have built a section of an enormous overpass and rotate it into place upon completion so as not to disturb the railways below. A 17,000 ton part of an elevated motorway was today slowly swung into place in Wuhan City after being constructed independently beside a high speed railway track. Engineers took 90minutes to carefully swing the 17,000-ton structure into place today above a high speed railway track in Wuhan City, central China . A China Railway High-speed train passes beneath the rotating sector of the bridge today as engineers expertly swivel it into place . It was the first time the technique had been used in China, with engineers unable to temporarily halt the busy train service in order to build the bridge in place . Experts took 90 minutes to connect the section to the rest of the bridge, tuning it 106 degrees on a 15metre high axis. It was the first time the innovative technique had been used in China. The country has the world's longest high speed rail network with over 6,200 miles of routes in service in December 2012. The track beneath the bridge in Wuhan City was considered too important to be temporarily halted in order for engineers' to complete construction. Once finished, the overpass will be 256m long and span 11 railways, including the 1,428 mile-long Beijing-Guangzhou service. Experts estimate the bridge will be open to traffic later this month. The 17,000 structure is slowly brought into place in by engineers after weeks of construction . The unusual technique has been used in the UK in the past, though never before in China . The 17,000-ton structure was rotated at 106 degrees on a 15metre axis . The sector is connected to the rest of the bridge after 90minutes. Officials estimate it will be open to traffic later this month . A similar technique was used to construct the Grade I listed Kingsgate Bridge across the River Wear in Durham in 1968. Designed in 1963 by Sir Ove Arup, the bridge's two halves were built on the river's bank and swung together at 90 degrees.","Engineers took 90 minutes to swivel the structure into place in Wuhan City today .

But it seems Pope Francis has other ideas as to how twosomes ought to spend Valentine's day - as he has invited engaged couples to the Vatican for to meet him in person on February 14. A very special Valentine's day: Pope Francis has invited engaged couples to a private meeting at the Vatican on February 14 . A note, entitled 'The Joy of Yes Forever' issued by Vatican city invites engaged, heterosexual couples to a . private audience with the Pontiff next month. 'Engaged couples who have already attended or are presently attending marriage preparation courses are invited to a meeting with the Holy Father,' the statement said in several languages, reports Asia one. Organised by the Vatican's Pontifical Council for Family, participants are required to register by January 30 to secure their place. Earlier this week the Pope, who has been hailed as one of the most modern leaders of the Church, baptised the child of an unmarried couple in a ceremony in the Sistine Chapel. Pope Francis baptised 32 children in a mass ceremony in the Sistine Chapel including those of unmarried couples . He has previously spoken out against priests who refuse to perform the sacrament on the offspring of unmarried couples, describing them as 'hypocrites'. 'You parents have the baby boy or girl to be baptised, but in a few years it will be they who will have a baby to be baptised, or a grandchild... And so goes the chain of faith,' he said according to the Vatican network. 'What does this mean? I would just tell you this: you are the ones that transmit the faith, the transmitters, you have a duty to pass on the faith to these children. 'It 's the most beautiful legacy that you leave to them: the faith.'","Engaged couples invited to private audience with the Pope on February 14 .

"By . Jennifer Smith . A coroner ruled the 'neglect' of tour guides and The Adventure Company played a part in the death of Rachel Burke (pictured) A coroner has blamed an adventure company for the death of a woman who died while hiking in the Himalayas as guides 'insisted' she undertake a gruelling descent despite suffering severe altitude sickness. Rachel Burke from Opington, Kent, had become so unwell she was unable to tie her own shoelaces during the Nepalese excursion, it was revealed. But the 28-year-old was allegedly told by 'untrained' guides at Himalayan Encounters to trek downhill for 10 hours, rather than being taken to a nearby health post, a court heard. The Ministry of Defence scientist died after attempting to complete the 1,000ft descent in April, one week into the trip arranged by The Adventure Company. Coroner Andrew Harris described the 'neglect' of one of the guides with whom the woman was left, ruling he was untrained in dealing with altitude sickness. 'I find there was a failure of both companies to ensure the guide taking her down the mountain had the training,' he said. 'Sending Rachel down the mountain with a guide who didn't have those skills was found by Dr Nicholas Mason (an expert in altitude sickness) to be a factor contributing to her death and I accept that. 'Having heard all the evidence it is not entirely clear why Ashok decided not to take Rachel to the health post in Marchermo,' he told Southwark Coroner's Court, adding: ‘It does seem to me that he underestimated the severity of her illness.’ Ms Burke had struggled to keep up with the group as they trekked through Gokoyo Valley in Nepal, it is believed. Friends who were accompanying the scientist on the trip said she had been unable to carry her own rucksack or tie her shoelaces in the days before her death after climbing 4,470 metres. On the sixth day of the trip, Ms Burke allegedly told guides she felt too unwell to continue after becoming short of breath. Rather than accompanying the 28-year-old to the health post that was 15 minutes away, two guides insisted they trek back down the mountain, a feat that would take 10 hours. The 28-year-old had become so unwell she could barely tie her shoelaces and was unable to carry her own rucksack during the hike in Nepal . One of the guides is alleged to have returned to camp half an hour later, leaving Ms Burke in the hands of an assistant, Ashok, who had not been trained in altitude sickness. With no satellite phone to call for help, the scientist managed only to descend 100metres in three hours. She was pronounced dead the following evening in Dole, Kathmandu, after trekking for most of the day. Dr Nicholas Mason, an expert in altitude sickness said: 'The chain of events that led to Rachel's death began with the decision to send her down.' It was revealed the group had been asked to climb 600 metres in one day, twice the recommended distance given by tour operators The Adventure Company. A health and safety executive at the company failed to properly assess the trip's level of risk, the court heard. Paul Medley, Product and Commercial Director of the company, admitted the itinerary included a 610-metre ascent, but told the court The Adventure Company was 'not aware' of a rescue post in the area. The scientist has been memorialised at Everest Base Camp in the 'Valley of Death'. Her mother has said she hopes the tragedy makes other adventurers aware of the risk involved . Recording a narrative verdict, Dr Harris said: 'I conclude that death was caused by high altitude cerebral oedema and high altitude pulmonary oedema altitude sickness.' He is due to issue a report to insist that tour companies routinely consult . safety guidelines issued by the Wilderness Medicine Society. Rachel’s mother Maureen Burke said in an online statement: ‘My daughter went on an adventure holiday and came home in a crate. 'I would really like to know more about my daughters last day on this . planet and I would like to think that she had the best treatment that . could have been given, but most of all that her life ended easily . without any pain and her realising what was happening to her. ‘I just hope that this story is told so that it will make people aware that high altitude sickness can be fatal.’ The 28-year-old had just completed a half marathon and played squash at least once a week. The Adventure Company have increased the safety equipment taken on treks and examined their procedures in light of the tragedy. 'We will spend time reviewing the coroner’s findings in detail, and continue to review our processes to ensure that every trip we offer operates safely,’ the company said in a statement.","Rachel Burke after suffering severe altitude sickness during trip in Nepal .

"By . Jennifer Smith . The average person switches between devices as many as 21 times an hour, a new survey has revealed. Research revealed our attention span is smaller than ever thanks to the growing presence of smartphones, tablets and laptops. Advertising researchers tracked the online behavior of 200 British people to discover how much time they spent on one device before picking up another. A new study has revealed the average British person switches between gadgets as many as 21 times a day . The method of research is favoured by Facebook and Google who try to follow users between gadgets so they can later prove to the success of online adverts. The websites try to monitor users' devices to prove that an advert seen on a smartphone at lunchtime encouraged someone to later make a purchase on their laptop, for example. But the research carried out by OMD produced startling results that come months after it was revealed the number of people simultaneously using devices has increased by 500 per cent in three years. Insight Director Chris Worrell told the Business Insider: 'We think brands need to experiment with new formats that fit with these new consumption patterns,' adding that users are always 'one step away from distrction'. 'Things like skippable ads on YouTube are almost priming people to expect that after the first five seconds of an ad, you can choose to stay with it or move on.' The average person uses three devices - a smartphone, computer and tablet and can switch between them effortlessly to perform simple tasks . The internet giant Google has welcomed the phenomenon which they call 'constant connectivity' In September it was revealed that 90 per cent of people switch effortlessly between gadgets to perform simple tasks. In addition, 77 per cent of online searches carried out from a mobile phone occurred in places where the user could have used as easily used a computer. Google has described the phenomenon as 'constant connecticity' and has welcomed it as a means of effective marketing. 'By adding information about where someone is, what device they’re using, and the time of day, marketers can figure out the best message to show them – not just at that moment, but for that moment,' vice president for marketing in America said.","Research into consumer habits found users switch between three devices .

Natural disaster authorities said more than 50 eruptions occurred, with rocks and debris landing three miles away from the mountain, though no casualties have been reported. The volcano was still spitting gas and lava as high as 13,00 feet this morning. Scroll down for video . Thousands of panicked villagers have been forced to flee their homes after Mount Sinabung erupted more than 50 times in a single night . Women and children were crammed into vans that were driven down the mountain's side. Residents are being temporarily sheltered in nearby areas . Cars and motorbikes raced down the mountain last night as lava and gas began to trickle from its mouth in the latest of a series of sporadic eruptions .

Soldiers joined rescue efforts in two village, Jewara and Pintu Besi, where houses and farms were covered in grey dust. More than 20,000 people have been evacuated from villages surrounding the volcano and placed in temporary shelters since the crater's alert status was heightened in November.

"By . Jennifer Smith . Jacob Rees-Mogg has come under fire for his mother's plans to build 19 new houses in the village of Hinton Blewett . A Tory MP has come under fire after his aristocratic mother unveiled plans to build a housing estate in the middle of a country village. Residents in Hinton Blewett, Somerset, are outraged by Lady Gillian Rees-Mogg's plans to build 19 detached houses in the historic village. Her Ladyship has been accused of taking advantage of a change in planning laws that allow local authorities to regulate applications for new buildings. The family is well known in the village where former editor of The Times, Lord William Rees-Mogg was a Baron. Jacob Rees-Mogg is the MP for North East Somerset, and lives in a neighbouring village. Residents claim to have been on friendly terms with the family, but now say they are 'disappointed' with the plans. Local farmer Graham Sage claims to have written to Lady Rees-Mogg personally to ask her to reconsider. 'I think people are feeling very disappointed and let down by this,' the 65-year-old said. 'It's totally inappropriate and I've never known them so upset about anything before. 'Even when the family moved they kept the Lord of the Manor title and . there was always this great closeness between the Rees-Moggs and the . people of Hinton Blewett.' Consultants gave a lack of housing land as the reason behind a planning application for 19 detached homes shortly before Christmas. Critics claim however the parish council has already found 15 individual, small building plots across the village which would be more suitable than an estate. 'There is no question about it, they are taking advantage of a narrow window of opportunity,' said Mr Sage. The family is well known in the village after the MP's father (left) was named the Baron of Hinton Blewett in 1988 . 'Two years ago this application would have been laughed out because you'd have had a (hard) job to put a garden gate or wooden shed up in this village. 'It will be the same again when Banes gets its act together.' Residents held the village's first ever public meeting to discuss the matter, while some have sent letters of objection to the plans which 'will spoil a very sensitive part of the Somerset countryside.' One person who wished to remain anonymous said: 'People are not sure how Jacob feels about this but he's bound to have a foot in both camps because the land belongs to his mother. 'But her Ladyship might be in for a surprise. In the old days the Lord of the Manor could do what he wanted, but the peasants are educated now and are in revolt.' Though the land is not green belt, it . is situated next to a Nature Conservation area and includes the Cam . Brook, a special landscape designation. Her Ladyship's planning consultants told . villagers that she will discuss financial . contributions towards improvements to highways and education or . broadband if she gets planning permission. Local farmer Graham Sage has said residents are disappointed with the plans which they feel could ruin the area's landscape . A local resident said: 'All planning is political and politically it would be convenient for Banes to grant permission for this development to help meet its housing targets, but for the residents of the village the application represents a money-making exercise by the owner of the land at the expense of the aspirations of others.' Mr Rees-Mogg said: 'Planning is a matter for the local council and is not something that an MP has any say over. 'However, the green belt is a national policy designation which I strongly support and would oppose developments that threaten it.' The MP's father, Lord William Rees-Mogg was the editor of The Times from 1967- 1981. Following his death in 2012 the former columnist was described as 'a Fleet Street legend,' and 'distinguished public servant'.","Lady Gillian Rees-Mogg proposed application for 19 new houses .

Hannah Rose, 71, was sleeping rough in a trailer caravan attached to a car when she contacted Ashford Borough Council in Kent in a bid to secure a permanent address in the town. She is desperate for a postcode so she can claim housing benefit and get her pension topped up from £50 to £145 a week. Hannah Rose, 71, has asked the council to recognise her make-shift caravan as a mobile home and provide it with a permanent address so she can claim benefits . 'Dirty': Ms Rose rejected the chance to live in the caravan at Blossoms in Charring Heath, Ashford . Ms Rose refused the caravan and is staying in a B&B paid for by the taxpayer . It led to her being moved into a £196-a-week B&B in the town so she wasn’t homeless over the Christmas period. But now she has rejected a caravan at the Blossoms site in Charring Heath, Ashford, recommended by the council - because it was too dirty for her and her two pet cats. Ms Rose, who has lived all over the UK and abroad, most recently moving to Kent from Sussex in November, said: 'It was absolutely horrendous. The caravan was disgusting. 'The windows were not clean, the furnishings were nicotine-encrusted and the stench of cigarettes was overpowering. It was unacceptable. 'The friend who came with me said she wouldn’t put a dog in there.' Ms Rose had originally been sleeping in her car when she arrived in Ashford, Kent, in November .

She lives there with her two cats . Ms Rose has been in the B&B since November 15 after she wanted the council to give her a postcode for her makeshift trailer so she could claim benefits. 'I may not have contributed much financially but the French club I ran made a big difference,' she said. The council says she has met with their housing team. A spokesman from Ashford Borough Council said they didn’t have a duty to inspect the caravan as it wasn’t an official offer of accommodation. He said: 'Ms Rose is still in temporary accommodation and investigations are continuing into her housing situation. 'When Ms Rose first approached Ashford Council she advised us that she would be happy to live in a caravan whilst she sought accommodation in an eco-friendly community. 'As part of our advice service we gave her the details of a caravan park as we were advised by them that they would accept occupiers on housing benefit. 'At no time was this an offer of accommodation through homelessness, therefore the accommodation did not require our inspection to confirm suitability.'

The mother-of-two, who is also a member of political campaign group Avaaz, feels she is entitled to receiving benefits as her own mother never received any and didn't even claim her pension . Ms Rose emigrated from the UK in 1996 when she married German husband Heimrich Stolz . The couple traveled the world with his work and Ms Rose spent much of the time not working so she could bring up their two children. When the marriage broke down she returned to the UK with African husband Philip Hamrioui and the couple bought a house in Exeter, Devon. Ms Rose taught French classes for children but says she was on a low wage so paid minimal contributions. When her second marriage broke up she said her home was ‘lost to the bank’.

"By . Jennifer Smith . A former supermodel who had £83,000 seized by police as part of an investigation into her criminal ex-boyfriend is trying to reclaim the cash which she says was given to her by a 'wealthy' friend. Oxana Zubakova said the money was not the result of a £50million money laundering scheme spearheaded by her former partner, Tarik Mehgrabi, but was given to her by another man who 'funded her lavish lifestyle'. Meghrabi was jailed in February after police raided 6,000 safety deposit boxes held across London - some of which the Syrian criminal shared with his then girlfriend, Ms Zubakova. Oxana Zubakova (pictured with the entrepreneur Luca Del Bono) claims money seized from the box by police was lawfully given to her by another man . The 37-year-old is now trying to reclaim money and jewellery seized from one such box, claiming much of it came from Spanish businessman, Miguel Buadas, and the rest from earnings throughout her high-flying career. Giving evidence via video link at the Old Bailey today, the former athlete and Dior model said there was 'no truth' in claims Mehgrabi funded her jet-setting lifestyle which saw her travel 'every two to three weeks'. The 37-year-old former model said a wealthy businessman funded her lavish lifestyle after the pair met in Majorca in 2004 . Instead, she said Buadas gave her cash to fund her lifestyle since the pair met in Majorca in 2004. When asked by prosecutors why she failed to mention the 'well established' man previously, Ms Zubakova  said he 'would not have appreciated an investigation into his life.' Rupert Jones, for the Serious Organised Crime Agency said: 'But you're happy to give that explanation now aren't you?' 'I have to,' Ms Zubakova replied, adding she was able to withdraw money from accounts held by Buadas in Russia. A panel of justices heard  today she once bought a £112,000 Mercedes with cash, and withdrew £85,000 in a single week. Ms Zubakova cited travel as the reason she carried so much cash, saying: 'I would go to Spain, Italy, France where I have a lot of friends. I have cash with me all the time...I've had cash all my life.' The court heard how the model opened the security box in 2007, and listed Meghrabi as an additional user though he scarcely accessed it. The box contained £83,000 worth of 500 euro notes, a £5,500 Tiffany pendant and an £11,000 Cartier necklace. The prosecution made clear the claimant, who is suing police for the forfeit of such assets,  was not a suspect in the original investigation but a 'key witness'. Judge Mr Levett will give his ruling on Monday.","Oxana Zubakova had £83,000 seized by police from a security deposit box .

"By . Jennifer Smith . Gypsy the puppy (pictured with a nurse) underwent emergency surgery after swallowing the spoon when her owner left it out . She’s only seven months old, so naturally Gypsy the Labrador still has plenty of life lessons to learn. First up? The difference between food and a spoon, as the astonishing X-ray image on the left shows. Gypsy had to have life-saving emergency surgery after swallowing a spoon her owner, Diane Harman, had left on the kitchen worktop while she went upstairs. 'The pot in which I kept all the teabags had been tipped over, so I thought at first she had eaten a teabag,' said Ms Harman. 'It was then I noticed the spoon was missing from the pot. I do get the odd senior moments, but I knew it was in there before. 'I looked everywhere for it, under the bed, in the dish washing bowl, outside and in Gypsy’s bed. 'Gypsy seemed fine, but I began to wonder whether she could have swallowed it.' Ms Harman was due to take another one of her six dogs to the vet so decided to bring Gypsy along for a once-over. After seeing the spoon in Gypsy's stomach during an X-ray, vets quickly rushed the puppy off for an emergency operation. 'The vet joked he had heard of the saying 'born with a silver spoon in their mouth' but not going the other way,' said Ms Harman. 'She needed an emergency operation, as it could have ended in serious problems. 'There was a risk of infection. At the time, you do have horror thoughts through your head, but I did trust the vets.' Vet David Robinson who performed the procedure added: 'The spoon had worked its way through her stomach and into her intestines. Vets discovered the spoon while giving the seven-month-old dog an X-ray . Gypsy could have been at risk of death if vets weren't able to retrieve the spoon when they did . 'If . we had not operated straight away, there would have been a high risk of . it perforating the intestine, which could have been fatal. 'We’ve taken all kinds of foreign objects out of dogs, but this is the first time we have had to remove a piece of cutlery.' According to her owner, Gypsy is prone to bringing strange objects in from the garden. 'You never know what she is going to bring in when she comes through the dog flap. 'To . be honest, there isn’t much more I can do to stop her getting things, . apart from hanging items off hooks off the ceiling. I try to push things . to the back, so she can’t get to them.' Since having surgery Gypsy has made a full recovery and is 'full of beans' again.

"By . Jennifer Smith . Jimi Hendrix pictured at the Brook Street property which will be turned into a museum . The London flat that Jimi Hendrix once described as 'the only home I ever had' is to be turned into a museum with money from the Heritage Lottery Fund. Rooms in 23 Brook Street where Hendrix paid £30 a week to live will be restored to their 1960s splendor to offer music-lovers a glimpse into how the late legend lived. More than £1million will be poured into displays of the Purple Haze singer's life and work. The musician, who has been hailed as the best guitarist of all time, came to Britain in 1966 as a relatively unknown American artist. His celebrity soon grew however, with music industry icons such as John Lennon, Eric Clapton and Mick Jagger gathering to hear him perform, the Guardian reports. Hendrix moved into the Mayfair property in 1968 to live with his then girlfriend, Kathy Etchingham. Kathy reportedly completely furnished the flat with their joint possessions and purchases, including curtains and carpets from John Lewis on Oxford Street. They lived in the flat for three months, using it as a base for Hendrix to conduct interviews and write music. Just two doors down was the former home of the classical music composer, George Frideric Handel. On learning that Handel used to live . next door, Hendrix allegedly went to the nearby One Stop Record Shop in South Molton . Street and bought the composer's Messiah . and Water Music. The separate properties that were built in 1971 are now linked together as the Handel House Museum. Hendrix died aged 27 in Notting Hill hotel just two years after moving into the property. His death is believed to have been caused by choking following a drug overdose. The flat in Mayfair is next door to the former home of German music composer George Frideric Handel . The Handel House Museum saw huge numbers of visitors when they put on a one-off exhibition of Hendrix's former home in 2010 to mark the 40th anniversary of his death (pictured) Handel died in his bedroom at the . Brook Street property in 1759. The Handel House Museum was created in . 2001 after the former tenant, a building society, moved out. The . rooms occupied by the composer have been restored to their Georgian appearance, though those lived in by the guitarist became museum . staff offices. But when the rooms went on display for a few hours during annual Heritage Open Days, places were booked out instantly an exhibition marking the 40th anniversary of the musician's death was sold out. The looming grant of £1.2million will allow staff to have their offices separately, and allow visitors to admire Hendrix's former home. A member of staff at the museum poses with an orange velvet jacket once worn by the musician during the exhibition in 2010 . The musician, hailed as the greatest guitarist of all time, moved to London in 1966. He died just four years later in Notting Hill . Wesley Kerr, chair of the London . committee of the Heritage Lottery Fund, said 'The Handel House Museum is . one of the most precious and evocative places in London. 'To . visit the beautifully restored home where one of history's greatest . composers lived, and invented some of the finest music ever written, is . already pure joy.'","The property on Brook Street in Mayfair cost musician just £30 a week .

A thug has been banned from drinking in his home town after racking up 32 offences and being Tasered three times by police trying to control his drunk temper. Ian Moorhouse has been the source of violence and disruption in Kidderminster, Worcester, since he was just 12. One of the 22-year-old's victims was so badly injured he was taken into intensive care for days after being punched. Police were forced to administer 50,000 volts to his body three times so he could be handcuffed after headbutting an officer and elbowing another in the face. Moorhouse has been banned from entering Kidderminster town centre and nearby Bewdley on Thursday, Friday and Saturday evenings under the terms of a Criminal Anti-Social Behavior Order. The three-year order also bans Moorhouse from using or threatening violence towards any person or drinking any form of alcohol in the town centre. He is also banned from communicating maliciously either by phone, text message or social media. Worcester Magistrates issued the order in September when the 22-year-old was jailed for three assaults including those towards police officers. Police have urged members of the public to report any sightings of the man breaching the conditions of the order after he was released on December 20. The 22-year-old has been banned from drinking in Kidderminster town centre (pictured) for three years . PC Andy Forbes of West Mercia Police, . said: 'Moorhouse earned a reputation for being the main cause of . disorder in Kidderminster on the busiest nights of the week. 'He . picked fights with people, and tried to get into pubs and clubs, . despite being banned from most of them, becoming threatening and . aggressive when refused entry. 'Moorhouse’s . behaviour is clearly unacceptable and people who want to enjoy a night . out in Kidderminster or Bewdley need to be protected from him. PC . Forbes added that if the criminal breaks the rules of the Crasbo, as it . is know, he could face going to jail for as long as five years. 'Several people have recently been jailed for flouting the terms of their CRASBOs or ASBOs, so this is no idle threat.'

"By . Jennifer Smith . The Lacock Cup has been sold by St Cyriac's Church in Lacock, Wiltshire, to the British Museum and the Wiltshire Museum for £1.3million . A church parish in need of funds for a leaking roof has sold a rare silver chalice for £1.3million. The silver Lacock cup, dating from the 1400s, has been described as one of the best-preserved artifacts of its kind. In spite of objections from parishioners at St Cyriac's Church in Lacock, Wiltshire, the heirloom has been sold to the British Museum and Wiltshire museum last week. Director of the British Museum, Neil MacGregor said: 'I am delighted that this beautiful and rare cup has been acquired so . that it can continue to be enjoyed by visitors to the British Museum as . well as in Wiltshire Museum alongside important pieces from Lacock and . the medieval period'. Decorated and edged with gothic motifs and gilded twisted rope-work, the . cup became a chalice for communion wine in a Protestant church in the . post-Reformation era. It had been on loan to the British Museum in London since 1963, though its value was not known until 2009 when experts estimated its worth as £2.2million. The cup will remain on display at the British Museum for the foreseeable future before being transported to Wiltshire at a later date. It is believed to have been donated to the church by Sir Robert Baynard of Lackham Manor 400 years ago. Sir Robert, who was the MP for Chippenham in 1584 and Westbury in 1856, is commemorated at St Cyriac's Church will a collection of brass plaques that were stolen in 2004, but returned to the parish after a police appeal. After his death, a series of brass plaques were placed in the floor of St Cyriac's Church in Lacock, commemorating his life. The plaques were stolen in mid-2004, but quickly returned after a national appeal by police. Petitioners battled against the sale of the cup which they claimed was one of the few valuable, historic items left in the village of Lacock. During an ecclesiastical two-day hearing however, Rev Justin Gau, Chancellor of the Diocese of Bristol, gave permission for its sale. Local residents and parishioners of St Cyriac's Church (pictured) objected to the sale claiming the chalice was one of the few valuable items left in Lacock, Village . 'I’m satisfied that the unique and exceptional circumstances of this case are sufficient reasons to justify the sale of the cup,' adding conditions of the sale to include that a replica worth no more than £5,000 be made. A spokesman for the British Museum said: 'The Lacock cup is an extremely rare piece of medieval English silverware, with a history dating to the first half of the 15th Century. 'The cup, which is in near perfect condition, began its life as a secular object but its function changed after the English Reformation as new religious practices meant that a larger communion cup was required to hold sufficient wine for the whole congregation. The Duchess of Cornwall's daughter, Laura Parker Bowles, was married at St Cyriac's Church in 2006 . Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles (left) leave St Cyriac's Church in Lacock, Wiltshire, after the wedding of the Duchess of Cornwall's daughter to Harry Lopes (right) in May 2006 . 'As the cup has no religious imagery on it, it was a perfect substitute in a time when strict laws prohibited the use of images.' The Lacock Parochial Church Council needed £350,00 to complete repairs on the roof of the church where the Duchess of Cornwall's daughter, Laura Parker Bowles, married in 2006. The remainder of the cash will be put in a trust fund which would net the village £50,000 a year in interest.","The Lacock cup was made from secular silver in the 1400s .

"By . Jennifer Smith . The 22-stone ten-year-old tops the list of obese pupils at a school where more than 50 under the age of 11 weighted 16 stone or more. File image . A ten-year-old schoolgirl has been weighed at 22 stone 11lbs in a city where six similarly aged children weigh more than 19 stone. Almost 50 youngsters under the age of 11 weigh more than 16 stone in the area where the unidentified girl tops the list of morbidly obese children. Figures obtained by a Freedom of Information request have revealed the shocking extent of the country's fast-spreading obesity epidemic. At one school 10 of the heaviest year six pupils at weighed more than a Mini Cooper collectively, and one in 10 children was recorded as obese when starting school. The 22-stone child from Birmingham had a body mass index of 70 - 40 points higher than the point at which a child is considered obese. Medics now warn that almost a quarter of children of the same age are officially classed as obese. The health risks of being morbidly obese include diabetes, osteoarthritis, obstructive sleep apnea, cancer, cardiovascular and liver disease. In total there were 11,777 pupils classed as obese in the year six age group in Birmingham last year. Birmingham City Council Cabinet Member for Health and Wellbeing, Coun Steve Bedserfor the city said: 'The statistic of one in four ten-year-olds being obese is the single scariest thing I know about the city. 'It has been clear from day one that childhood obesity is an absolute priority. 'This is a national crisis and failing to tackle the obesity time bomb is not an option.

"By . Steph Cockroft . A daughter who was abused by her mother when she was seven years old is calling for more help to be given to the 'forgotten victims' of paedophiles. Kelly Whitfield, from Tyne and Wear, was still a schoolgirl when she stripped naked by her mother Martha Owens, who watched on as she was abused by her step-father Frederick Dixon. Now, in the wake of several high profile sex abuse trials, the 42-year-old - who waived her anonymity to talk about her ordeal - is demanding more is done to help those whose lives are ruined by paedophiles. Kelly Whitfield, 42, from Washington, Tyne and Wear, who was abused by . her mother and step-father when she was a schoolgirl, says more need to . be done to help the 'forgotten victims' of paedophiles . She said: 'All too often the emphasis is on the abuser and the victims are forgotten about. 'They are children and they need help and support because they often don’t understand what’s happening to them - how could they?' Miss Whitfield suffered in silence for decades as she struggled to come to terms with the abuse. But she says the wave of recent sex abuse allegations - including an alleged paedophile ring in Westminster and trials involving well-known defendants - gave her the strength to speak out. Miss Whitfield said: 'I’m coming to terms with the abuse now but I don’t know if I’ll ever come to terms with the abuser being my mum. 'A mum is supposed to protect you, to look after you, to make sure this never happens. But she gave me to him. Martha Owens, from Sunderland, stripped her daughter naked before watching as Miss Whitfield's step-father abused her . 'My mother got a nine-month suspended sentence for what she did. I got a life sentence.' Owens, 63, of Goodwood Road, Grindon, Sunderland, pleaded guilty to four charges of indecent assault last year at Newcastle Crown Court. She was given a nine-month jail term, suspended for two years. The court heard Owens carried out the offences out of a desire 'not to cross' Dixon. Dixon denied the allegations and committed suicide on New Year’s Eve that year, before his trial. Miss Whitfield said: 'When all of this was happening to me my mam kept telling me it was OK - they both did. 'I was a child, I didn’t know what was happening. It was only as I got older that I realised this wasn’t right, that it wasn’t happening to other people.' Miss Whitfield, now a mother herself, believes more education is needed and that more support should be offered at an earlier stage to those who are affected. Her calls come after Children’s Commissioner Maggie Atkinson, former Gateshead Council’s director of Children’s Services, launched a national inquiry into sexual abuse. The two-year probe will look specifically at sexual abuse within the family environment. She said: 'Most of our children are raised in secure, loving homes but I’m sure many of us will be disturbed by how much abuse within the family goes unreported and how little is done to support the children who suffer.' Miss Whitfield kept her abuse a secret for more than 30 years. But, after years of counselling, she finally felt able to speak out over what had happened in her family. Her mother and step-father were arrested in 2012. Owens, 63, last year pleaded guilty at Newcastle . Crown Court to four counts of indecent assault. Her step-father Frederick Dixon, who . denied the allegations, committed suicide before his trial . After the court case, she told the Sunderland Echo: 'Growing up, I couldn’t wear certain clothes, no make-up, no perfume. It was his way of making sure no one else would look at me. 'When I asked my mother about what he was doing to me, she’d just says “he’s doing it because he loves you”, and I believed her. 'I know it was him who abused me, who did all this stuff, but it would never have happened if it wasn’t for her.' Sentencing Owens after last year's court case, Judge Paul Sloan QC said he accepted Owens herself suffered abuse at Dixon’s hands and that he was 'manipulative and controlling'. He said: 'His influence explains your involvement in the commission of these offences and I accept, as is evident, you are truly remorseful and truly ashamed of what you did.' Defending Owens, Tony Hawks said: 'The guilt and shame is something she will never get over.'","Kelly Whitfield's mother stripped her naked and watched as she was abused .

The eerie footage shows the abandoned ship submerged in water and gives a haunting insight into the last moments of the luxury cruise liner which struck rocks with more than 4,200 passengers and crew on board. A total of 32 people drowned in the tragedy which occurred on January 13, 2012 . The video, taken by police divers, has been released just days before salvage workers attempt to re-float the 950 foot vessel and tow it to the northern Italian port of Genoa where it will be dismantled and sold for scrap . The eerie footage shows the abandoned ship submerged in water and gives a haunting insight into the last moments of the luxury cruise liner which 4,200 passengers and crew fled after it struck shallow rocks. However, while thousands managed to flee the stricken ship, 32 passengers drowned in the tragedy and captain Francesco Schettino remains on trial for charges of mass manslaughter and abandoning ship. The 52-year-old faces allegations that he was showboating to onlookers on the holiday island before the ship grounded and has been accused of holding 2am trysts in his cabin with Moldovan dancer Domnica Cemortan, despite being a married man. However, he denies the claims and charges and says he didn't abandon ship but instead fell onto a lifeboat as the ship keeled over on the night of the disaster on January 13, 2012. He claims he then stayed on dry land because he wanted to co-ordinate the night-time evacuation from there.

The environmental risks are enormous in terms of leaking of poisonous fluids from the ship and in terms of the structure breaking down. ‘There are nearer ports that can be reached easily and with less risks.’ Genoa beat off many other contenders including ports in Turkey and the UK to win the lucrative contract, which will provide hundreds of jobs over two years.

"By . Emma Glanfield . A huge spillage of mash potato brought a major road to a standstill as emergency services desperately tried to clear up the unusual incident. Motorists were urged to avoid the A64 near Malton, North Yorkshire, after it was left covered in food when a lorry accidentally shed its load. The lorry dropped just over a quarter of its contents on the carriageway at about 3.30pm yesterday, which resulted in thousands of drivers being stuck in huge traffic jams. Police were forced to close the road after the lorry shed its load of instant mash potato on the A64 in North Yorkshire. Officers said the lorry shed about a quarter of its load in the incident which caused huge tailbacks . The lorry was travelling westbound towards York, before the road becomes a duel carriageway, when the incident happened. One witness, who wished not to be named, said: ‘It was like a sea of white. ‘I was about a mile away from where it happened but I could still see it. ‘At first I just didn't know what it was. I heard it was mash potato, but I am not sure whether it was mashed before or after the spillage. ‘It was a big disturbance for the area, and I think the only diversion for drivers would be down country lanes. ‘The road was closed for hours and hours.’ Motorists were urged to avoid the A64 near Malton, North Yorkshire following the incident (stock image) North Yorkshire Police said the road was closed after the incident created unsafe driving conditions. A spokesman said: ‘Instant mash is covering the road and cars have skidded as a result of the mash swelling up.’ Highways Agency crews and firefighters also attended the scene and the road was closed in both directions for several hours while the carriageway was cleared. Nobody was injured in the incident and the road was later re-opened on Saturday evening. It is the second time this month that a lorryload of mashed potato has led to traffic chaos. Twenty firefighters along with police and an ambulance were called to Henley Bridge in Henley-on-Thames following a report that a lorry had crashed and spilled its load. Initially, it was feared there had been a toxic chemical spill, but it later turned out to be mashed potato that was due to be used in animal feed. The road was closed for three hours while rescue workers scraped the potato from the road and hosed it down.

"By . Darren Boyle . An elephant which appeared in Oliver Stone's epic movie Alexander has been killed by poachers in Thailand.. The 50-year-old elephant was poisoned by poachers who then sawed-off its tusks at the Ayutthaya Elephant Palace. As well as appearing in the movie starring Colin Farrell and Angelina Jolie the elephant named Klao was found dead yesterday at the nature reserve. The elephant was found on Friday at the Ayutthaya Elephant Palace after it was attacked by ivory poachers . The elephant was worth £70,000 according to local media reports. The Bangkok Post reported that Thai police arrested one man who is believed to be a drug addict in connection with the crime. They found poisoned bananas at the scene which were used to kill the beast before the one metre long tusks were removed. Police believe that the poaching gang were amateurs as they failed to remove all of the tusk. It is understood they used an electric power saw to cut through the ivory. The facility's manager Laithongrian Meephan admitted that the animal was probably poisoned before it was mutilated. He said the centre breeds and trains elephants and also acts as a retirement home for the animals who are revered in Thai culture. Although the country is also a major transport hub and destination for the illegal trade. Elephants are revered in Thai culture and animals from the sanctuary - including Klao - are regularly used in parades and festivals honouring the country's royal family as well as being used for film and TV work . Mr Meephan confirmed that Klao had also been used in parades celebrating the Thai royal family. He has also trained elephants for martial arts star Jackie Chan. The wildlife sanctuary is popular with tourists and guests even have the opportunity to hire an elephant to explore the countryside. Travellers pay £700 to stay at the sanctuary where the get the opportunity to care for an elephant and ride it into a river. Mr Meepan is the world's largest owner of elephants and has introduced a highly successful breeding programme at this centre. Wildlife trade monitoring group TRAFFIC said: 'Thailand has the unenviable reputation as home to one of the world's largest unregulated ivory markets.' Elephants are the de facto national animal and were once featured on the Thai flag. TRAFFIC estimates that Thailand has a population of 2,500 to 3,200 Asian elephants in the wild, and cites government statistics that another 4,169 were held in captivity in 2012. Their numbers have decreased over recent decades and expanding human settlements have shrunk their natural habitat. The beasts once were used overwhelmingly for logging, but deforestation and a consequent ban on most logging has led to many elephants now being used as tourist attractions. TRAFFIC said one reason that Thailand is a major smuggling point for ivory poached from African elephants is that a 75-year-old law permits the legal trade of ivory from domesticated Asian elephants inside Thailand, though the origin of retail ivory is seldom checked. 'Monitoring of Bangkok's domestic ivory market by TRAFFIC reveals a near trebling of the number of ivory items for sale in the past 18 months and a steep rise in the number of retail outlets selling ivory in Thailand's capital city,' it said. The group said that at least 20,000 African elephants were killed in 2013 to meet the heavy demand for ivory from Asia, and more than 13 tons of African elephant ivory have been seized inside, or headed to, Thailand since 2008. Staff at the Elephant Palace believe that poachers poisoned the beast before hacking-off its tasks .","Klao the elephant appeared in hit movie Alexander alongside Angelina Jolie .

"By . Margot Peppers . Elementary schools across the country are launching bans on edible birthday treats like cupcakes in a bid to fight childhood obesity - much to the chagrin of some children and parents. Edmonds School District outside of Seattle, Washington, is just one location where teachers are tightening up the rules on the types of treats parents can bring in for their children's birthday, citing health reasons for the change. 'People need to understand that the entire food environment of the school matters,' Marlene Schwartz, director of the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale, told Today.com. Party poopers! Elementary schools across the U.S. are launching bans on edible birthday treats like cupcakes in a bid to fight childhood obesity - much to the chagrin of some children and parents . 'It's not fair to say to the food service providers that they are not allowed to sell candy and soda but then say it's perfectly fine for 30 parents to bring in cupcakes for the whole class 30 times a year.' The ban was inspired by the federal Wellness Policy promoted by Michelle Obama, which requires school superintendents to monitor the nutritional standards of unregulated food items, such as those prepared by parents. And for some mothers and fathers whose kids suffer from allergies or weight problems, the cupcake ban is a welcome change that will undoubtedly benefit their children. But other parents are outraged by the new rules, many of them placing the blame on Michelle Obama's healthy eating initiative. 'Instead of banning cupcakes, how about parents be parents and encourage more physical activity?' one critic wrote on Twitter. Another person called the ban 'absolutely ridiculous,' and a third person tweeted: 'The Nanny state is alive and well'. Moms like . Erin Ornes, who has two sons in the Edmonds school district, fear that . the new restrictions will only fuel competition between parents as they . strive to come up with creative ways to celebrate birthdays without the . use of food. Should children be allowed to have birthday cupcakes at school? 'It’s bad enough to see who made the best cupcakes or who just stopped by the grocery store,' she said. 'But now to see who makes the best non-food celebration? Low-income families and single moms that really don’t have time to think or deal with this will have the hardest time.' And father Richard Martinson, whose grown children once attended schools in Edmonds, told Herald Net that the rule is too extreme. 'It's a little bit of fun that makes school more bearable, and now it's gone,' he lamented. Still, for parents like Melissa Dobrich, whose daughter is severely allergic to peanuts, a schoolwide ban on homemade sugary treats may well be a lifesaver. The Washington mother said that while she doesn't want to spoil the fun of all the other kids, it's important for school to be 'safe place for my daughter to learn.' Similar bans have also been implemented at some schools in Michigan, Colorado, Kentucky and Minnesota.","The bans are inspired by the federal Wellness Policy promoted by Michelle Obama, which requires superintendents to monitor the nutritional standards of unregulated food items ."

'If you must use one of those strollers, be aware of the potential brake issue,' warns the magazine, which labeled the stroller a 'Don't Buy' product. Bad review: Consumer Reports has labeled Graco's Ready2Grow Classic Connect LX stroller (pictured) a 'Don't buy' product after its brakes released when it was angled 19-degrees up on a tilt table during a safety test . Consumer Reports also found that after the stroller underwent the test, the plastic teeth that lock the wheel sin place were bent and showed stress marks. The company responded that there have been no brake-related injuries reported for this particular model, and Consumer Reports confirmed this claim. Graco added that the brakes are being upgraded 'as part of continuous improvement,' and that the new system will meet the safety standard as tested by the magazine. The stroller, which is able to carry two children simultaneously, is one of the most popular purchases on the Graco website, with customers giving it an average rating of 4.2 out of five stars.

"By . Margot Peppers . A group of mothers whose children are in various stages of cancer treatment have come together in a special act of camaraderie. At the annual 46 Mommas event in Boston last week, 46 mothers shaved their heads in a public ceremony, raising more than $200,000 for the St Baldrick's Foundation, which funds pediatric cancer research. 'Every mom there is a cancer mom,' co-organizer Maisy Yeager - whose son Zarek was just eight when he was diagnosed with acute lymphoid leukemia - told Yahoo Health. 'So you can talk, and everyone will understand what you're talking about.' In it together: At an annual event in Boston last week, 46 mothers of children with cancer shaved their heads, raising more than $200,000 for pediatric cancer research . In a moving photo from the ceremony, all of the moms pose together, smiling as they show off their newly-shaven heads. Another picture shows Allison Smith, from Indiana, who holds up a photo of her son Jackson, a brain tumor survivor. The poster reads: '46 Mommas - Shave for the Brave, 2014 Boston'. The event, which is held in a different U.S. city every year, aims not only to bring these moms together so they can share their mutual struggles and feelings, but also to raise awareness of the importance of pediatric cancer research. The fact that exactly 46 mothers are involved is a symbol for the statistic that each weekday of the year, 46 mothers in the U.S. are told that their child has cancer. 'It's horrible, hearing the words ""Your . kid has cancer,""' said Ms Yeager, who works as a pharmaceutical biochemist in Massachusetts. 'It's unimaginable, the dread of loss . you feel.' 'Once you do this crazy, powerful thing together, . it's like, boom, we're sisters' Fortunately for Ms Yeager, Zarek survived the disease thanks to years of steroid treatments and surgeries. But for 2,000 mothers in American each year, their child is not so lucky. 'Some have suffered . way more than others - some are what we call ""angel moms,'"" explained Ms . Yeager. 'It's not a great description, but it's the best one out . there.' This year's 'angel moms' included Annmarie Kulikowski, who lost her three-year-old daughter Elizabeth to a brain tumor, and Bonny Neufeld, whose son Matthew passed away at age ten. Awareness: The fact that exactly 46 mothers are involved is a symbol for the statistic that each weekday of the year, 46 mothers in the U.S. are told that their child has cancer . For a cause: One of the Mommas smiles as she has her pink locks chopped off. The team of parents has raised more than $1.5million through pledged donations since it was founded five years ago . Amazingly, these women still continue to show their support for their fellow 'cancer moms', turning their tragedy into motivation to keep fighting for the cause.

'We're all these women from all across . the country, as different as can be,' she said of the 46 Mommas event. 'But it's a sisterhood . almost immediately.

'So you can talk, and everyone will understand what you're talking about' 'I thought I was going to turn into an emotional wreck while my head was being shaved. But instead, I felt very free and happy and empowered,' she told the Shoreline Times. 'It was . like taking control away from cancer.

"By . Margot Peppers . Bill de Blasio and his family moved into the historic Gracie Mansion this week, and they enlisted the help of West Elm to redecorate it with donated furniture. In one photo from inside the official mayoral residence that New York's First Family now call home, a room is adorned with patterned beanbags, bright blue sofas and geometric light fixtures from the Brooklyn-based home furnishing company.

"By . Margot Peppers . Bethenny Frankel is courting even more controversy for that selfie she took while wearing her four-year-old's pajamas. In a scathing editorial published on the Huffington Post on Thursday, Dr Drew's daughter Paulina Pinsky - who has been very open about her own struggles with eating disorders - accuses the 43-year-old reality star of 'exploiting others who struggle with... insecurities and mental illnesses for pure economic gain'. The 21-year-old added that Bethenny's behavior will likely have a negative effect on her daughter Bryn. 'Teaching a child that maintaining her toddler-sized body is what she should want is only going to set her up for a life plagued by body insecurities,' she wrote.

In the photo in question, the Skinnygirl mogul strikes a pose in her daughter's tiny Hello Kitty sleepwear. She captioned the picture: 'This is my daughter's nightgown and PJ shorts. Think we're ready to start sharing clothes yet?' The post sparked a heated debate online about whether it was appropriate for the star to show off her thin frame in such a way. 'She is blatantly perpetuating the . unrealistic standard of beauty that declares that we must all shrink . ourselves down to fit into what is considered ""beautiful"" and ""sexy,""' wrote Paulina. The senior at Barnard College in New York also said the photo reminded her of her own experience during her teen years, when she would desperately try to fit into her childhood clothes, 'because I told myself that I would fit back into those tiny excuses one day.'

Paulina, whose editorial was titled Bethenny Frankel, You Are Not Being Funny, also took a jab at the intended humor in Bethenny's post. 'The last time I checked, Bethenny Frankel is not a comedian,' she wrote. 'Stay out of comedy, Ms Frankel. You do a better job making a living exploiting body insecurities. 'And once you realize that you are part of the problem, there are people waiting for you to become part of the solution,' she concluded.

I got good grades, had a boyfriend and was thin: I . was living the life everyone had always told me I should want for . myself.' Since then, she and her mother have apparently strengthened their relationship, and Paulina has made it her mission to be a spokesperson for others struggling with eating disorders.

"By . Margot Peppers . A record number of Americans are currently living in multigenerational homes with their parents, grandparents or both - and it's millennials who are leading the trend. According to a study released by the Pew Research Center today, 18.1per cent of the population - or about 57million Americans - currently shares a home with older generations in their family, more than double the number in 1980. What's more, for the first time, more young people are living at home in multigenerational arrangements than adults aged 85 and older. Under one roof: A record number of Americans are currently living in multigenerational homes with their parents, grandparents or both - and it's mostly because of millennials . Going back home: According to a study today, 18.1per cent of the population - or about 57million Americans - currently share a home with older generations in their family . Researchers used U.S. Census Bureau data from 1940 to 2012 to reach their findings. They found that the number of multigenerational homes jumped significantly during the Great Recession between 2007 and 2009 because of obvious economic factors, but it has been steadily rising ever since. While only 18.7per cent of 25- to 34-year-olds lived with their parents or grandparents in 2007, just before the global financial crisis, this figure has risen to 23.6per cent today. In contrast, just 22.7per cent of adults ages 85 and older lived in a multigenerational household in 2012. Millennials trump senior citizens: What's more, for the first time, more young people are living at home in multigenerational arrangements than are Americans aged 85 or older . Back in 1980, only 11per cent of people in this age group lived in their childhood home. Young people living with parents or grandparents may be another sign of delayed entry into adulthood, along with marrying later and staying in school longer, the Pew report said. Among the younger generations, men were significantly more likely than women to be living with their parents, grandparents are both. The researchers found that 26per cent of males between 25 and 34 lived in a multigenerational household in 2012, compared with 21per cent of females in the same age group. Different backgrounds: Race, gender and economic factors also play a roll in the changing figures . Race and social factors have also played a roll in the growth of multigenerational homes; Pew reports that racial and ethnic minorities are generally more likely to live in such situation. With an increase in the immigration population since the Seventies, the number of multigenerational home arrangements as increased as well. Indeed, the research center reports that in 2012, one-in-four Hispanics and blacks and 27per cent of Asian Americans live in homes with their parents, grandparents or both.","A new study released by the Pew Research Center found that for the first time, more young people are living at home in multigenerational arrangements than adults aged 85 and older ."
"By . Steph Cockroft . Is Tom Daley due to retire? Reports say the British diver, pictured with his Olympic bronze medal, will quit the sport after this month's Commonwealth Games in Glasgow . British diver Tom Daley is reportedly set to retire from the sport after the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. Sources close to the 20-year-old star say he will quit diving this year amid fears he will not win a medal at the next Olympics. An ongoing struggle with a 'phobia' of his back twist dive - for which he was receiving therapy - is also said to be behind the decision. But a spokesman for the diver denied the claims, saying Daley's 'goal' was to compete at Rio 2016. The source reportedly said: 'Sadly Tom has decided he’ll retire after the Commonwealth Games to avoid Rio. 'He’s . pretty much got no chance of medalling at the Olympics. If he can . retain gold at the Commonwealth Games then he’ll out on a high. 'His . struggle with his back twist has been well documented and he knows the . time will be right. 'He’s had a great career in diving and has so many . other opportunities.' Earlier this year, the two-time Commonwealth champion revealed he was having therapy to try to eradicate the issue with the 'terrifying' back twist dive. The source says his self-confessed 'phobia' of the dive means he will find it hard to win bronze, silver or gold at Rio. This, coupled with the long training regime needed to qualify for an Olympic Games, means he has decided to retire following the Glasgow event, it is claimed. A source said Daley's current form, as well as a 'phobia' of a back twist dive, for which he was having therapy, has led to the decision. A spokesman has denied the claims, saying Daley plans to compete in Rio 2016 . A spokesman for the athlete denied the claims of early retirement, adding: 'Tom’s working hard in training and his goal remains to compete in his third Olympic Games, at Rio 2016.' In the wake of the reports, Daley also tweeted his 2.6m followers saying: 'Back into training! #SeeYouInGlasgow and RIO ;)'. After roaring success in junior championships, the diver won his place in Team GB at the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games. He later won a bronze medal at the London Olympics in 2012. After finishing sixth in last summer's World Championships, Daley left his long-term base in Plymouth and his coach Andy Banks to train at the London Aquatics Centre through to the Rio Olympics. In April this year, Daley missed out on a medal at the Diving World Series after finishing fifth in the final of the 10-metre platform. Daley, pictured here with his boyfriend Dustin Lance Black, is due to compete in the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow on August 2 . Despite an otherwise successful performance, the back twist dive - a two-and-a-half somersault with a two-and-a-half twist - proved difficult for the diver. It is the same one which he had to repeat at the 2012 Olympics after an unexpected camera flash from the crowd. After that, the diver admitted he was desperately seeking help over his fear of the dive and that the scale of the issue was 'massive'. He said: 'It is almost trauma therapy - to get myself to process the things that have gone wrong on it to get it to a stage where I can forget about it and feel positive about it. 'I am literally terrified of it. I suppose you could call it a phobia and I don't know what my heart rate is when I go up there and do it but it's definitely above 180, something ridiculous, because it is so terrifying.' Daley will compete in the 10m Platform on August 2 at the Commonwealth Games, which is due to start tomorrow. He is scheduled to do his pre-games . media conferences on Thursday before the diving competition gets underway in Edinburgh on July 30. Meanwhile, the diver returned to England yesterday after being unexpectedly grounded in Russia. Daley was returning from an event in Shanghai ahead of the Commonwealth Games when he and his partner Dustin Lance Black were among 301 people who were forced to land in the Siberian city of Irkutsk. Their Virgin Atlantic Airbus A340 had a 'technical issue' which Daley made known when he tweeted about it to his 2.5 million followers.","Daley, 20, will reportedly retire amid fears he will not win a medal in Olympics .

"By . Margot Peppers . A stay-at-home dad has taken a stand against the modern-day concept of play dates, claiming that they 'alter the spontaneity of our children'. Chicago native Chris Bernholdt, a father-of-three who runs a blog called DadNCharge, writes that when parents arrange meetings between their children and constantly stimulate them with activities and entertainment, it's detrimental to their independence. He also harks back to his own childhood, which saw him fending for himself in terms of playtime and consequently learning how to flex his imagination. Ban the play date!

The former high school teacher adds that it doesn't help when parents encourage a friendship that may not have occurred naturally, or when they force children to adhere to their own agenda. 'Adding the . word ""date"" to this phenomena of play has ruined the whole experience for . me,' he says.

Not only do play dates put unnecessary pressure on adults, but they also is harmful to children, says Mr Bernholdt, who describes his working wife as 'a rising star in the corporate world'. 'Kids are at their best when their imaginations are in play,' he says. 'We are dumbing down their ability to be . independent thinkers with scheduled activity, and feeling like we are to . blame when they have ""nothing to do.""'

"By . Sam Creighton . After the chilling cold and soaking rains of the last few months, Britain is due some sort of weather related happiness and it has finally come in the form of a sunny Spring, which has seen beautiful purple wisteria bloom four weeks early. The pretty lavender and viola flowers, which usually come out in May, are producing stunning displays across the country after an unusually mild April. Gardeners say the sunshine has helped the purple plant put on a particularly spectacular show this year. Swathes of wisteria, which flowers for about a month, are now creating wonderful walls of purple on cottages and houses across Britain. Wisteria floribunda can climb as high as 20 metres above the ground and spread out 10 metres wide. It is unusual in that its flowers come out before the leaves, making it particularly attractive. At Cambridge University's historic Christ's College visitors were yesterday stopping to admire the plant which now stretches across the whole of the Master's Lodge. 'The wisteria is a month earlier this year as we've had lots of sun and it has really helped the plant to thrive,' said Steve Griffiths, head gardener at Christ's College. 'It is an extremely good display and the flowers are now in full bloom and looking at their best. 'The wisteria is drawing lots of visitors to the garden as when they look through the college gate it's the first thing they see.

"By . Sam Creighton . Christian monuments have been destroyed by the Chinese government in a move that will fuel fears of a state sponsored crackdown on the religion. On Saturday, fifty officials blocked entry to Longgang Hill, in the city of Wenzhou - know as China's Jerusalem - a site of pilgrimage for the country's Christians. They used cranes to rip up statues and built walls around three others - depicting Jesus, the Virgin Mary and Saint Jospeh - which weigh up to five tonnes each. There were no clashes with worshipers, as government workmen kept a promise not to damage the three bricked-off statues. Four bulldozers started demolishing Sanjiang church in Wenzhou on Monday, after six weeks of protests . The torn up monuments are being stored at a church property in Hengdaiqiao, a Wenzhou suburb, but all other relgious decoration on the hilltop park was destroyed. The authorities are claiming the construction of the park was illegal but Christians say this is just a pretext to justify their persecution. Joseph, a Wnnzhou Catholic who declined to give his full name for security reasons, told UCA News: 'Even if the authorities determined that erecting religious articles on the site is against the law, they should allow us to appeal through legal means. This could help build the rule of law in society and stop corruption.' Another anonymous witness to the destruction said: 'About 100 Catholics who came to watch the removals were blocked at the entrance. Some who managed to sneak in sang hymns and prayed while watching. Some could not hold back their tears.' Two days later, bulldozers were sent in to demolish the city's Sanjiang Church, which was only completed last year at a cost of £2.84million. The church's destruction is the end of a six-week-long struggle which had seen thousands of Christians camped outside the building in a bit to save it. UCA News also reported that last week, state officals beat up four Christians who were trying to prevent the demolition of a four-storey building, owned by a Catholic laymen. The authorities claimed that the building's top two floors had been built illegally and that it was being used as a site for underground worship.","Government officials destroyed statues on Longgang Hill, a pilgrimage site in city of Wenzhou .

"By . Sam Creighton . A fantasy series it may be but Game of Thrones is a decidedly adult drama. Dominated by dragons, duplicity and dastardly deeds, the world of Westeros has gripped viewers with its tales of fueding families and illicit love affairs. However, for the 6.9million Chinese viewers who tuned in to watch the show's second season on state television, it wasn't quite what they expected. The show is known for quite graphic love scenes between its characters but these have been largely edited out for the official Chinese broadcast . Its adult themes and complex relationships form a large part of the show's appeal but Chinese viewers claim much of this depth is lost in the edited version . A dubbed and edited version of the popular HBO show - with much of the violence and nudity removed - began airing last weekend, drawing ire from audiences, many who have already seen the complete version of the show through the internet. The first season was shown back in 2012, with much the same editing policy, but the new broadcast still angered many viewers. One disgruntled Thrones fan posted on Chinese social networking site Weibo: 'I estimate that they cut about twenty minutes. The story feels discontinuous… my first reaction was ""This can’t be!"" Then my second reaction was, ""My God, what a mess"".' While another complained: 'So they’ve cut about a quarter of all the fight scenes, then a quarter of the nude scenes. What is it...a medieval European castle documentary?' Fight scenes also form a major part of the fantasy epic but have again been largely edited . CCTV, the state broadcaster, also came under fire for its decision to air the show with dialogue dubbed into Putonghua - the standard Chinese dialect. SCMP.com reports that one viewer complained on social media that '[This dub] really makes [Game of Thrones] sound like a Taiwanese drama. I’m boycotting all dubbed versions of American TV, CCTV can go to hell.' The move follows a week of controversy for Chinese broadcasters, which, as part of the Chinese government's 'Cleaning the Web' initiative, have removed popular US shows - including the Big Bang Theory, The Good Wife, NCIS and The Practice - from video streaming sites. The Peoples' Daily newspaper, the regime's official mouthpiece, justified the decision, saying it was necessary to protect the public from 'negative effects and hidden security dangers'. CCTV also later announced it had bought the rights to re-air The Big Bang Theory and that a 'healthy' edit would be broadcast in the near future.

"By . Sam Creighton . A dangerous superbug sweeping through Britain's hospitals could make even routine operations too dangerous to carry out. A study by Public Health England (PHE) has revealed that only one drug is still effective against the New Delhi metallo (NDM) enzyme - imported into the UK by people who have undergone medical treatment in India. The report goes on to warn that even this last useful drug - coliston, which has not been widely used since the 1980s - will eventually become ineffective, making NDM extremely hard for doctors to treat and leaving patients at severe risk if they catch it. The number of cases of the superbug has increased fivefold since it was first identified in Britain in 2008 . The research also found that three other medicines had very limited success in treating NDM. The bug has been circulating in India . since 2006 and was brought to the UK in 2008 by a patient who had . travelled to the region. There were six reported cases in this first . year but the figure has shot up fivefold to 148 in 2013. A number of other suffers had recently travelled to the Indian sub-continent when they contracted the disease and the Balkans is known as another global hotspot. Professor . Anthony Kessel, Director of Public Health Strategy at PHE, said: 'The . results of this study are a stark reminder of the issue that we are . facing with the growing problem of antibiotic resistance. Having only . one antibiotic available for treating patients with this resistance . mechanism and limited effectiveness with a further three represents a great . challenge for the future of healthcare as we know it. 'Some . affected UK patients had travel-related risk factors, but cases in the . community setting show the potential for these resistant bacteria to . spread even further. We are actively working with our stakeholders to . address the issue of resistance head on as this is one of the most . pressing healthcare issues of our time.' NDM has developed resistance to almost all antibiotics making it extremely difficult to treat . Many sufferers were found to have recently travelled abroad and brought the bug back with them but it has also begun to spread in this country . The most common bacteria with NDM enzymes was Klebsiella, followed by E. coli. Most of us carry these bacteria harmlessly in our guts but they can cause infections if they get into the bloodstream or urinary tract. There are a number of different resistance mechanisms and these make treatment much harder.","New Delhi metallo has developed resistance against all but one antibiotic .

However, not only did the little boy from Imperial, Nebraska, make an astonishingly speedy recovery, he claimed that while surgeons were fighting to keep him alive, he visited heaven, sat on Jesus's lap and patted his rainbow-striped horse. It's a remarkable story and one that has taken the US box-office by storm this Easter, raking in $22.5million (£13.4million) in its opening weekend and nearly $52million (£31million) overall so far. Scroll down for video . Colton Burpo, now 14, claims he visited heaven while undergoing surgery aged three . Colton's father Todd, a part-time fireman and Baptist preacher played by Oscar-nominee Greg Kinnear in the film, and mother, Sonja - played by English actress Kelly Reilly - at first didn't believe their son but found themselves being won over as he recounted more details of his experience, The Mirror reports. The boy, who is now 14, told of how he rose out of his body on the surgical table and saw his father cursing God and his mother weeping - which is what they claim they were doing at the time. He also says he met his great-grandfather and his sister, who was lost in a miscarriage a year before he was born - both people his parents say they have never mentioned to him. Colton, pictured aged 11, talks to terminally ill children via Skype to comfort them . While in heaven, Colton says he met a blue-eyed, brown-haired Jesus, chatted with John the Baptist and saw the Virgin Mary praying at God's throne, all the time serenaded by a choir of angels singing Jesus Loves You. Colton, who is now a high-school wrestling star and promising musician, uses his experiences to comfort terminally ill children and their families, talking with them via Skype. He said: 'It helps the kids realise, ""Hey, I don’t have to deal with all this pain... I got something better waiting for me."" 'It also helps the family. It reassures them because if you go to heaven you’re going to have the time of your life. 'I’m not scared of dying because I know where I’m going.' Critics have dismissed Colton's claims, some even suggesting they are being exaggerated to drive sales of his father's book, also called Heaven Is for Real. Atheist author Susan Jacoby wrote in The Washington Post: 'Only in America could this book be classified as non-fiction. 'At age four, an inability to distinguish between fantasy and reality is charming. But among American adults, widespread identification with the mind of a ­pre-schooler is scary.' Even the director of the film, which opens in the UK on May 9, Randall Wallace - who made his name as a writer for movies like Braveheart and Pearl Harbour - said: 'It was crucial I had doubts about Colton’s story. 'If someone is trying to convince me of a dogma, I’m not interested. 'But if someone is recounting an ­authentic experience, I’m fascinated.'

Colton's parents Todd and Sonja are played in the film by Greg Kinnear, left, and Kelly Reilly, right . However, even a decade on, Mr Burpo is adamantly standing by his son's visions. He said: 'There’s no medical explanation for all this – there is only a heavenly one. 'We seem to avoid talking about things like life and death until we are confronted with them, like at a funeral. 'But it can be comforting to know there is more out there.'","Colton Burpo was rushed into surgery, aged three, with a ruptured appendix .

"By . Mark Duell . and Sam Creighton . This £300,000 end-of-terrace house may have almost trebled in value after a work of art was covertly painted on one of its walls overnight. The mural, which shows three secret agents eavesdropping on conversations at a phone box, is thought to have been created by the mysterious street artist Banksy. It was spotted on Sunday morning on Karen Smith’s house in Cheltenham, Glouvestershire a few miles from the GCHQ surveillance base. Ms Smith, 48, heard voices outside in the early hours but thought nothing . of it until she spotted men loading huge screens into a van in the . morning. Creation: The new graffiti street art piece, suspected of being a Banksy, which appeared on the side of a house in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire . Taking a look: People crowd around a new graffiti street art piece, which is thought to be a nod to the town's role as the home for Government spy centre GCHQ .

'I heard male . voices outside in the early hours but it wasn’t until I saw the . tarpaulin screen at about 7.30am I thought anything of it. Questions: The painting is yet to be officially claimed by the secretive artist, but graffiti experts say it has all the tell-tale traits of the Bristol-born creator . Closer-up: Pictures of the work were also posted on Facebook by Robin Gunningham - a name often linked to the secretive artist . Value: Full-time mother Karen Smith, 48, won¿t profit from the alleged Banksy - because she only rents the house on which it was painted from a private landlord . ‘I thought it might be something to do with the police, like when a crime happens. 'It’s pretty good. It livens the street up a bit' Karen Smith . 'When I came out I saw people staring at it and asked them what they were looking at. ‘There was also a van with writing all over it where they were putting the screens in.’ She added: ‘When I saw it I hadn’t even heard of Banksy. 'But as soon as my daughter saw it she knew straight away and told me how popular he is. 'It’s pretty good.

Expensive: The famous 'Kissing Coppers' sold for £350,000 in February after it was removed from a Brighton pub 10 years ago . Unusual: Banksy has used telephone boxes in his work before, including in this piece, which appeared in an alley in Soho, London, in 2006 . Ms Smith added: I’ve heard . they can be worth a lot. I’ve been trying to get hold of my landlord but . they haven’t got back to me.’ Banksy has yet to claim the Cheltenham piece as his own, but . fans say it has his trademark ‘narrative, style and execution’. Website . streetartnews said: ‘At the break of dawn, the British street artist . showed up with a maintenance van and covered all the sides with . tarpaulin to execute his new stencil. ‘While . not officially confirmed by his website, this piece has all the Banksy . characteristics in narrative, style and execution.’ Cheltenham . street artist Dice67 said: ‘It’s definitely Banksy. It’s brilliant. Graffiti is definitely all about location. 'That’s why he’s come to . Cheltenham, to do something about GCHQ. ‘People will travel to Cheltenham from all over the world to see this.’ Pictures of the work were also posted on Facebook by Robin Gunningham - a name often linked to the secretive artist. A spokesman for GCHQ said: 'This is the first time we have ever been asked to comment on art.' Jane . Griffiths, director of commissioning at Cheltenham Borough Council said . the artwork could be protected, with permission from the landlord. Abroad: His work has not been confined to the UK - the mysterious artist sprayed this image on the Israeli West Bank Barrier . Machine: This Banksy image caught the eye of commuters after it mysteriously appeared in a bricked up window in 2007 in Finsbury, north London . Famous: The Rude Lord (left) was sold in London in 2007 for £320,900, while Space Girl and Bird (right) went for £288,000 . High price: Keep it Spotless, a 2007 Banksy, sold in New York in 2008 for £1,111,900. It is the most expensive piece of his artwork ever sold . ‘The council cannot condone graffiti which is put onto people's property without their permission,’ she said. ‘However, we recognise that the public do see work by Banksy as significant pieces of public art and it is clear that this piece has been getting a huge amount of favourable attention. It would be a shame if it was removed or damaged. ‘As the artwork is on private property, it is the for the property owner to decide whether they would want it to be kept - they would need to consider the impact this may have on the residents of the property and the wider community. ‘Although we still do not know if it is original work by Banksy, given the public interest, we would be happy to help the owner find a solution which would protect it from tagging or other graffiti.’","Karen Smith heard voices outside but thought nothing of it until she spotted men loading huge screens into van .

"By . Sam Creighton . One subway train rammed into another that was stopped at a station in South Korea's capital today, injuring more than 100 commuters. Yonhap news agency reported that mechanical problems led to the moving train running into the back of the other at 3.30pm local time (6.30am GMT) on the platform of Sangwangsimni Station, one of Seoul's major stations. Officials are still investigating but it is believed that a failure of the train's automatic distance control system may have been responsible. Scroll down for video . Blood stains mark the floor inside a subway train after a collision at Sangwangsimni station in Seoul . The subway train rammed into the back on another that was stationary at the platform of the busy station . The mechanism that is meant to make sure the train stops if it gets too close to another object is thought to have failed . 170 people were hurt and 32 were taken to hospital, although no serious injuries have been reported . Investigations are still being carried out but it is believed a mechanical failure is to blame for the collision . The crash occurred at Sangwangshipri station, one of the busiest in the South Korean capital . Local media also reported long delays in officials providing instructions to passengers about what to do. This could strike a nerve in South Korea, where the captain of the ferry that tragically sunk on an April 16, has been condemned for waiting 30 minutes before issuing an evacuation order. About 170 people were hurt in the accident and 32 were taken to a nearby hospital, but there were no serious injuries, a city official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because she wasn't authorized to talk to the media on the matter. Railway workers were called in to deal with the scene but authorities have been under fire for not reacting quickly enough .

It was up to half an hour before passengers on the trains were told what to do by officials . One of the trains was simply waiting in the station when it was struck from behind . Another official later said it wasn't clear how many were taken to the hospital. Hospital officials also said there were no serious injuries. The accident comes as South Koreans are criticizing the government for lax safety practices that many feel contributed to the ferry sinking, which left more than 300 people, mostly high school students, dead or missing.","A moving train crashed into another stopped at Sangwangsimni Station .

"By . Sam Creighton . In the land of Hollywood, contract killers are pretty cool customers. Be it Jean Reno's ultimate professional in Leon or John Cusack's slick everyman in Grosse Pointe Blank, film after book after video game has painted the hitman as a righteous (if amoral) dark avenger. But how close it that to reality? When someone is gunned down, does the person pulling the trigger really fit this super-cool stereotype? Santre Sanchez Gayle, left, was a 'novice' hitman, while Roger Vincent, right, was an experienced 'journeyman' Professor David Wilson, who led the team of criminologists who conducted the research for the new study . This is the question asked and answered by a group of criminologists at Birmingham City University. Professor David Wilson, who led the team of four researchers, said: 'All these images are Holllywood-ised. The hitman seems like quite an attractive image that people are responding too. It’s stylised, fetishized. They are all very professional, very competent, hyper masculine - but the reality is the 16-year-old boy who is getting paid £200 and is very successful. 'In the movies the hits usually take place in smokey bars and casinos but in reality they are taking place in the suburbs, in Middle England when people are walking their dogs or are on their way back from the shops or a meal or the gym. The hits were not in the underworld, they were in the overworld and usually with passers by as witnesses looking on in abject horror.' The researchers pored over newspaper reports of contract kills, transcripts of court cases and conducted their own interviews with policeman, prison guards and convicted criminals. The study, published in The Howard Journal of Criminal Justice, lays out a four category framework to explain the different types of people who become hitmen. The first type is the 'novice'. As the name suggests, this is someone at the beginning of their killing career, possibly having just picked up their first contract. Professor Wilson said: 'Often the novice is much younger but they tend to come from an offending background. With the novice there is a sense that they are trying to establish themselves within a gang network and therefore will gain kudos from committing the hit.' Novice - Colin Farrell's Ray in . the 2008 film In Bruges is a good example of a novice. Hiding out in . the Belgian town after his first hit went tragically wrong, Ray is . wracked with guilt. Despite having little similar experience behind him Ray had . envisioned the start of a underworld career but inexperience and immaturity meant it was not to be. Dilettente - . Poor old Jesse Pinkman. The character for hit TV show Breaking Bad . never set out to kill anyone but faced with a life or death choice at . the end of the show's third series he feels forced into murdering a rival. Feeling like he stumbled into such an act of violence, nothing is . ever quite the same again. Journeyman . - 1997's Grosse Pointe Blank saw John Cusack's CIA-operative turned . hitman return to his hometown for a high school reunion. Calm, collected . and definitely not a man to be trifled with, Blank has carved himself a . successful career in wet work but a slight reliance on luck stops him . from stepping up to the next level. Master . - Objective to a fault, (almost) nothing and no-one gets between The . Professional and his target. The film's opening sequence shows how . effective Leon can be and his strict rules, ruthless training regimen and . under-the-radar lifestyle makes him the ultimate Hollywood assassin. Professor Wilson said: 'I've never met a master hitman so I can't really . say, but I certainly imagine that is the sort of world they would exist . in'. The study flags up 16-year-old Santre Sanchez Gayle as an example of a novice. The teen shot Gulistan Subasi, 26, in London in 2010, in exchange for £200 - money he used to buy a fake Gucci hat. The hit itself was successful but Gayle was brought to justice because of his inability to stop bragging about what he had done. The second category is the 'dilettante'. This is the only type that can be considered to have 'fallen into being a hitman' Professor Wilson explains. The dilettante is usually someone older, without a criminal background, who sees the quick fix money of a contract kill as their only way out of a crisis. Professor WIlson said: 'It’s almost like they fell into becoming a hitman because someone offered them three grand to take out an ex-wife or a business rival. There is no sense therefore the dilitente wants to move through a hierarchy like the novice, they just want to overcome their crisis.' The dilettante example used by the study is Orville Wright, a former legal clerk who accepted £5,000 in 1996 to kill Theresa Pitkin, 30, in London. However, Wright struck up a conversation with his intended victim and lost his nerve, unable to go through with the hit. Due to their lack of criminal background, the dilettante is also the only type of hitman who is unlikely to be able to obtain a gun. Category three is the 'journeyman' - an experienced, reliable, career criminal. Professor Wilson said that while this type of hitman will often have completed a greater number of contracts than any of the others, it's their connection to a specific area's criminal underworld that leads to their downfall. He said: 'The journeyman hitman was often caught because of local intelligence, he was part of the community and often after he committed the hit, there was enough local intelligence that can be given to the police to bring them to justice.' The study's example of a journeyman is the pairing of Roger Vincent and David Smith in 2003. The duo executed David King - a criminal who underworld bosses suspected had become a police informant. The hit itself was meticulous. They gunned King down as he came out of his gym and then fled the scene in a van, which they dumped and brunt before switching to another vehicle. However, one mistake brought it all crashing down. Smith left one of his gloves at the site of the vehicle switch, which gave police the evidence they needed to track the pair. The final category - the master - still has a level of mystery around it. For all their research, Professor Wilson and his team were not able to find any records of a master hitman being caught. They did, however, identify the gruesome work of such an operator. The killing of gangland boss Frank McPhee in Glasgow in 2000 is a master's hit. McPhee was assassinated with a sniper rifle outside his home while his son watched. Professor Wilson described it as 'the most professional hit committed in Britain'. As no master has ever been caught, it's difficult for the researchers to draw up a complete profile of what this type of hitman might be like. Professor Wilson explained: 'You can’t really interview these people so it’s difficult to build a psychological profile but it became pretty clear to us that with the journeyman and the masters had a paramilitary or military background which meant they could gain access to weapons, were comfortable around weapons and be able to dispose of evidence after the hit, so were forensically aware.' He is still trying to take his research further into the last two categories of hitman and is working with a group of PhD students to do so but it's slow going. 'It is incredibly difficult because you just don’t gain access to these people,' he said.","The study has been done by criminologists at Birmingham City University .

The twin polar bear cubs, born on December 9 at Hellabrunn Zoo in Munich, Germany, were officially named today but they didn't let something as trivial as a christening get in the way of all-important playtime. Dashing about their enclosure, play fighting and generally giving their mother - Giovanna - the run around, Nela and Nobby didn't seem to have a care in the world. Scroll down for video . Nobby and Nela have been officially given their names today . The importance of the occasion seemed lost on the pair who happily scurried around their enclosure . The twins, who are now four months old, live at Helabrunn Zoo in Munich, Germany, with their mother Giovanna . Ever since the pair made their first public appearance nearly four weeks ago, there has been a lot of speculation around what they will be called. It has taken so long to decide on names because choosing them is an honour reserved for the animals' godparents, which have just been picked. To fill these roles, the zoo has chosen wildlife photographer Norbert Rosing, whose work often features polar bears, and a Munich-based coffee company. It has taken so long to decide on names for the bears because the zoo first had to choose their 'godparents' Nobby's godparent is wildlife photographer Norbet Rosing, while Nela's is a local coffee company . Norbet Rosing named Nobby after himself and, when the bear is older, he will be referred to as Norbert . Nela has been named after the aunt of coffee company owner Emanuel Clemm, who was called Cornelia . The only criteria for the names was that they had to start with N - the same as for all animals born at the zoo in 2013 - but, otherwise, the godparents had free reign to decide. Mr Rosing took the opportunity to name the cub after himself and, once Nobby has grown up, he will be referred to as Norbert. While Emanuel Clemm, the owner of the coffee company that has sponsored Nela, chose the name in honour of his aunt Cornelia.

"By . Sam Creighton . There will be no new inquiry into the 1974 Birmingham pub bombings that claimed 21 lives and injured a further 182 people. West Midlands Police today announced that an 18-month . re-examination of the evidence had not revealed any new leads on the attacks. However, Chris Sims, the force's chief constable, insisted the investigation was still open. 21 people were killed and a further 182 injured in the blasts at two Birmingham city centre pubs in 1974 . The remnants of the Mulberry Bush pub after the blast, the other target was the Tavern in the Town . No one has been brought to justice for the atrocity, which saw bombs explode at the Mulberry Bush and the Tavern in the Town pubs on November 21, 1974. Mr Sims posted a statement on the West Midlands Police website after meeting with relatives of two of the people who died in the blasts. It read: 'Nothing would give me more satisfaction than to bring those responsible for this atrocity to justice. However we have found no new evidence that would assist us in bringing anyone to justice for the pub bombings. 'I have been able to share with these families further details regarding the tragic events of that night. I am sorry that families were not kept up to date or engaged with as is standard practice today. Forty years ago was a different era and a different force. West Midlands Chief Constable Chris Sims insisted the investigation is still open . 'However, I make this pledge today - I would like to offer families of those who died or people who were hurt on the night to be given as much information as possible to answer the questions that we can. I would ask them to contact us so we can start that process. 'It is always possible that brand new and significant information could become available to us - let me be clear - this case is not closed.' Mr Sims said a reassessment of evidence by West Midlands counter terrorism unit, which began in June 2012, had collated and preserved around 18,500 items including information from the 1974 and 1991-1994 investigations. More than 9,000 items had required assessment, he said. He added that the police have also commissioned an independent review of the potential forensic evidence. 'There have been questions over the years why certain individuals such as the people named by the media apparently never formed part of any investigation,' he said. 'I want to be open and transparent today and tell you that these men had been subject to investigation in the 1970s and the 1991-94 investigation. There was insufficient evidence for proceedings against any person.' Six men were jailed for the bombings in 1975. The Birmingham Six, as they became known, spent 16 years in prison before their convictions were quashed in 1991.

Drivers could have been forgiven for thinking they would not have to deal with an increasing rodent infestation on the road. However a video has filmed a rat so big that it stopped traffic as it made a dash across four lanes of busy traffic in Chicago, Illinois. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . The video follows the huge rat as it tentatively wanders along the kerb before darting out into the road . On a busy road in Chicago, Illinois, the hilarious clip catches a gigantic rat stopping cars dead in their tracks, even forcing four to swerve out the way, as it ambles across four lanes of traffic, paying no mind to the oncoming vehicles. The group of girls filming the video can be heard laughing hysterically in the background. Mimicking a driver of one of the cars forced to take evasive action, one of the girls says: 'He's like someone move this dog'. Several cars have to take evasive action to avoid the rodent as it blazes its trail across the four lanes . Miraculously, the rat manages to make it safely to the other side without being injured, let alone killed . Commenting on its size, she says: 'Oh my God, it's the biggest rat I've ever seen.' Chicago is known to have a rat problem and, as ABC reports, this will only worsen as the weather improves.","Huge rat darts across four lanes of busy traffic in Chicago, Illinois .

"By . Sam Creighton . Hundreds of mourners gathered today to pay tribute to fun-loving TV chef Clarissa Dickson Wright - whose coffin was decorated with her favourite cooking ingredients. The 66-year-old, who died in Edinburgh's Royal Infirmary last month, became a much-loved figure as she toured the UK in the sidecar of Jennifer Paterson's motorbike, as part of their television show, Two Fat Ladies. Family and friends gathered in the city's St . Mary's Metropolitan Cathedral, where her coffin bore a . wreath made from red chillies, . sage, broccoli, cardamom and artichokes. Scroll down for video . The TV chef died last month after a long stay in hospital, the nature of her illness has not been revealed . The popular chef, left, shot to fame in her TV show 'Two Fat Ladies' with Jennifer Paterson, right . The chef died on March 15 but had been in the hospital since the beginning of 2014. The cause of death has . not been made public. Catholic celebrant, The Very Rev . Monsignor Michael Regan, said: 'Clarissa was a woman of contradictions . who was a believing Catholic, who as she said herself was ""bolshy from . the beginning"". 'Her life was a life of contrasts, of incredible wealth and incredible poverty. 'She . has influenced so many people and we are here to give thanks, but also . to pray for her, because as a catholic she wanted the prayers of the . community. 'She . will be remembered as a larger than life, colourful figure who . contributed to so many lives and touched so many people in different . ways. 'She . will be remembered fondly by vast numbers of people, some of whom only . knew her through the television, some knew her from her London life and . some who knew her from her from her Edinburgh life.' The . 90-minute service included a Horn Concerto by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, . an Entrance Hymn by Sydney Carter, Psalm 23, The Offertory Hymn by Cecil . Frances Alexander and a Communion Hymn by John Greenleaf Whittier. The service took place in Edinburgh's St Mary's Metropolitan Cathedral and was attended by family and friends . Miss Dickson Wright's friend Morag MacKay performed the 1930s ballad 'A Nightingale Sang in . Berkeley Square' and Sally Merison recited Home is the Sailor by A. E. Houseman. A recovering alcoholic, Miss Dickson Wright, who died in Edinburgh's Royal Infirmary last month, would have celebrated 27 years of sobriety this week. The Very Rev Monsignor Regan told mourners: 'Through her education and upbringing she proved herself to be a brilliant woman and her career seemed destined for greatness but she had the self-destruct mechanism of so many gifted people and her downward spiral is well-known. 'But from that downward spiral where she found herself homeless and penniless she learned a sympathy with others that stayed with her and through her association with Alcoholics Anonymous she found and gave strength to others.' The chef's coffin was adorned with a wreath of chillies, sage, broccoli, cardamom and artichokes . Clarissa was born in 1947 in St John's Wood, London, as the youngest of four children to Molly and Arthur Dickson Wright, who was a surgeon to the Royal Family. She attended Sacred Heart School in Tunbridge, Kent, and went on to study for the Bar at Gray's Inn while she pursued a law degree at the University College London. At just 21 years of age, she passed the Bar and became England's youngest barrister. She was an active campaigner for the Countryside Alliance on rural issues . But, after the death of her parents, Miss Dickson Wright fell victim to depression and alcohol addiction, which put an end to her legal career. Marah Dickson Wright, the chef's sister-in law, said: 'I think she will be remembered with great humour. 'She was very, very clever and intelligent and funny - just a wonderful human being. Everybody will miss her greatly. 'Her sobriety was an absolutely fantastic achievement. I remember taking her into the drying-out place and on 10 April it would have been 27 years. 'Every year on that date she rang me up to say thank you from anywhere in the world. 'She hardly had enemies and if she did, they made it up in a moment or two.' Clarissa went on to become a cook and worked at the Books for Cooks shop in Notting Hill, London, before managing the Cooks Books shop in Edinburgh, where she found TV fame. From 1994, she starred in the successful Two Fat Ladies series, where she cooked feasts while touring the country in a motorbike's sidecar. The show was broadcast around the world, but came to an end during its fourth series following the death of colleague Jennifer Paterson in 1999. Clarissa then went to live in the coach house of plush Manor House close to her family in Inveresk, East Lothian, and starred in several more TV programmes and documentaries. She campaigned for the Countryside Alliance and also became the first female rector of the University of Aberdeen, which said it was 'saddened' to hear of her death. The coffin was carried out of the cathedral to the tune of My Home and Mist-covered Mountain, before her family and friends attended a private cremation . Edward Armitage, Miss Dickson Wight's nephew, said: 'Clarissa was an enormous ally of mine and great fun. 'She was one of the greatest human beings that walked the planet and influenced so many people into recovery from various forms of addiction. She will hugely missed by many people.' Professor David Casson, a friend and member of Gray's Inn, said: 'I remember Clarissa as a very old friend. 'She was a remarkable personality and someone who enlivened every occasion at which she was present. 'She was an extraordinarily able and intelligent woman with many, many qualities. 'Her career started as a young barrister, where she was a well-known and prominent figure at among the junior bar at Gray's Inn. 'She was known, from very early days, to be a very sociable person who lived entertaining her friends and colleagues. 'She was much admired and often the centre of attraction. At this early stage, we are clearly mourning, that is inevitable, but we are also celebrating the remarkable life of a remarkable person.' A lone piper then played her coffin out of the cathedral to the tune of My Home and Mist-covered Mountain, before her family and friends attended a private cremation. A collection was taken for local charities campaigning on issues of alcohol dependence and homelessness.","A large crowd of family and friends attended the service in Edinburgh .

One of the first things he did after being discharged was post the picture of the fry-up on his Facebook page, with the caption 'Get in'. Friends and family of Mr Hewitt have written messages of support under the picture. Jonathan Hewitt posted: 'Get it down you followed by a few bevies you deserve it'. While Christopher Bracchi said: 'Now pal I'm glad ya on the mend hope all is well pal I'll see u for a pint sum time bud (sic).' Despite being allowed home, Mr Hewitt still faces months of plastic surgery. However, it is possible that he could make a recovery. Dr Raj Persad, a consultant urologist, told MailOnline that a new penis could be constructed even if the original tissue is lost. He said: 'The best hope is that doctors have kept the tissue in a viable way so the penis can be reconnected. If the tissue is no longer viable, the options are limited. 'It may be possible to make a phallus – rather like that created in gender reassignment surgery. 'Here, tissue expanders can be used to create a flap of tissue that can be rolled into a phallus. The urethra would also have to be reconstructed.' Police are still investigating the incident are are trying to piece together Mr Hewitt's movements in the 11 hours before he was found by the side of the A66. Mr Hewitt was found covered in blood by the A66, near Middlesborough, police are still investigating . It is believed he was attacked at a site often used by the traveller community, in South Bank, near Middlesbrough. While the assault was originally reported as a revenge attack, speaking last week, a close friend of Mr Hewitt told The Daily Mirror he though the assailant had attacked the wrong man. He said: '‘He has a big family in the area, and it has shocked everyone who knows him. He is no villain. ‘You wonder if he was in the wrong place, at the wrong time, and whoever did this was looking for someone else. We can see no reason for anyone having a go at him like this.' After the incident, he had to be placed in an induced coma at James Cook University Hospital, Middlesborough. Once he was woken up, specially trained officers visited him to conduct interviews but, for the first several attempts, he was too traumatised to speak. A 22-year-old man was arrested in connection with the incident but was later released on police bail while inquiries into the attack continued. Debbie Lewis, Mr Hewitt's ex-partner and mother of four of his children, previously said the family had been 'devastated' by the attack. Her mother, Christine Mclachlan, 62, said relatives increasingly believe the attackers got the wrong man.","Kevlin 'Kelly' Hewitt was allowed home from hospital yesterday .

"By . Sam Creighton . Scottish prison chiefs launched an investigation into Facebook messages suggesting drugs were being smuggled into jail for a former model who was serving life for killing her boyfriend. Caroline Igoe, 34, was jailed in 2010 for murdering her boyfriend, Martyn Barclay, with his own gun. The probe, launched in January after prison authorities were handed copies of the online messages, was into concerns that drugs and a phone could have been smuggled into HMP Edinburgh for the mother-of-four. Caroline Igoe with her then boyfriend Martyn Barclay who she is convicted of murdering in 2009 . The inquiry has already concluded and it is understood officers found no evidence that contraband had been brought into the prison. The social media exchange was reportedly between two of Igoe's associates. Prisoners themselves have no access to the internet and there is no indication the killer had any involvement in the conversation. One message referred to the smuggling of 'subys' - a slang name for suboxone, which is used to help heroin users through withdrawal. In another, it was claimed a mobile phone had been taken into the jail for Igoe to use. In the Facebook exchange, a woman claimed she was going to jail for a 'little remand' and allegedly offered to smuggle drugs inside for the killer. It suggested she was 'taking a phone in' for Igoe and any drugs she could source. One message said: 'I’m no wanting to go in wae oot drugs for em (sic).' The woman said it was 'short notice' but added that 'anything at all you can put together for her' she would attempt to smuggle in. Caroline Igoe, left, was convicted of murder in 2010 and sentenced to life in prison in HMP Edinburgh, right . She added: 'Every little helps in there.' Scottish Prison Service said they do not comment on individual cases. Martyn Barclay, 26, was found dying in the street outside Igoe’s home in Inch, Edinburgh, in January 2009. Sentencing her, Lord Bracadale said: 'Martyn Barclay was your boyfriend and very unwisely kept a handgun. That does not mean he deserved to be shot by it. 'You shot him in a public street in the morning. Just why you did that is not clear, but you have left his family bereft.' Her brother Paul was cleared of murder but jailed for six years for trying to cover up the crime by removing and disposing of the gun. Igoe had previous convictions for malicious damage and dishonesty. It was said in court Igoe and Barclay had fought over money just hours before she shot him with his 9mm pistol. Minutes after the murder she was browsing online modelling photos of herself.","Caroline Igoe, 34, is serving life in HMP Edinburgh for murder .

"By . Sam Creighton . A lesbian couple accused of starving their three children and chaining their eight-year-old daughter to the wall so she could not get food have had further charges added to the case against them. Initially charged with felony child endangerment, Eraca Dwan Craig, 31, and Christian Jessica Deana, 44, have now had false imprisonment, child neglect and child abuse added to the laundry list of accusations levelled against . The three children — two boys, aged three and five, and a girl, eight — were found on March 14 at their squalid home in Salinas, California, after two of the children missed scheduled appointments. All three were taken into protective custody and the girl was hospitalized for five days. Heinous: Christian Jessica Deanda, pictured left, and Eraca Dwan Craig, pictured right, are accused of abusing their children and nearly starving them to death . Monterey County Sheriff Scott Miller told the Monterey Herald: 'It was a particularly heinous case' and said the children had 'hardly eaten for months', they all showed signs of both physical and emotional abuse. The girl, who appeared to have suffered the most extreme abuse, was chained to the floor to prevent her from getting any food. 'It seems that the little girl was the major target of this abuse,' Sheriff Miller said, adding that she looked 'like a concentration camp victim'. Hellish scene: Police allege they found a horrific scene in the family's home with one of the women's adopted children chained to the floor . Craig and Deanda were both arrested at the scene. Neither appear to have criminal records in Monterey County. Jeremy Dzubay, the lawyer representing Deanda, said there is a 'wider story to tell' but has not hinted as to any of these details. Bail was set at $500,000 for each woman and, if they are bailed, they are banned from making any contact with the children. They were both arraigned in Monterey County Court on Tuesday, March 18, and were scheduled for a preliminary hearing today. However, the hearing has been postponed and a new date has not yet been set. Authorities said the women seemed to be making preparations to leave before they were arrested. Investigators found little food inside the home, which was cluttered and dirty, according to reports. The girl and the older boy were adopted children, and the younger boy is the biological son of one of the women, Miller said.","Eraca Dwan Craig, 31, and Christian Jessica Deanda, 44, have had false imprisonment, child neglect and child abuse added to their charges .

"By . Richard Spillett . A mother was left horrified after her son unwittingly racked up a £1,000 bill in just two weeks by playing online games. Kay Flanders, 49, was stunned to discover that 11-year-old Liam's £10 a month phone bill had rocketed to £850. He had signed up as a member of online game Small Worlds - where users create their own virtual universes - until 2020. And, unknown to her, he had bought optional extras such as credits to buy special items and VIP membership which grants exclusive access to other parts of the game. Scroll down for video . Kay Flanders is warning other parents after her son Liam ran up a £1,000 phone bill playing online games . The debt has now increased to nearly £1,000 with added admin costs and phone provider T-Mobile is threatening to send in bailiffs to recover the money. Ms Flanders, of Minster-on-Sea in Kent, said: 'It was like he was playing with toy money, not real money. 'He just pressed the button to keep buying these things. He hasn't received anything. It's just bits to this game on Facebook. It's just on screen. 'It's a complete madness. How can they do this on a kid's game? No sane adult would be playing this.' Ms Flanders, a beauty therapist, added: 'Liam has been so upset. He's offered to sell his Xbox, his TV, everything to pay for it.' Small Worlds allows players to create their own characters in a virtual world and develop the game by moving through missions and levels. Small Worlds offers players a 'Virtual World of Possibilites' but has left Ms Flanders facing a massive bill . Liam played the game on a laptop but all of the purchases were made and confirmed through his mobile, which is registered in his mother's name. Ms Flanders has written to the company and the game's developers hoping to get a refund on some of the money but neither have responded to her. T-Mobile says all charges are set by the game provider but it is currently looking into the issue. Small Worlds has yet to comment on the issue. A spokesman for PhonepayPlus, which regulates phone-paid services in the UK and has powers to ensure consumers receive refunds, said it would look into the circumstances.","Schoolboy played Small Worlds game through Facebook .

"By . Sam Creighton . Private James Bell was a driver before being relieved of his duty and sent home . The touching story of how a young father was reunited with his family in the midst of the First World War has been uncovered. In a series of events that seemingly echoes the plot of Stephen Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan, army chiefs gave permission for James Bell to leave his post and return to his wife and two young children in Australia. The decision of the War Office was prompted by an impassioned plea from Pvt Bell's sister, Annie, who wrote a letter explaining how James' four brothers had already given their lives for Queen and country and asked for him to be released from duty. Although James and his youngest brother Laurie emigrated to Australia in 1913, while the other three sons stayed in their hometown of Keighly, West Yorkshire, upon the outbreak of war, all five felt the need to volunteer. Tragically though, in one bloody 18 month period, these five brothers-in-arms were reduced to one. On December 1, 1915, Laurie, the first to lose his life, died as part of the Australian forces at Gallipoli, aged only 22. Just weeks later, on December 27, in the fields of Flanders, John, 30, took a bullet to the head. Then, the oldest brother, Joseph, 42, was killed on June 23, 1917, by a falling bomb in Flanders. The messages sent between Annie Bell and the War Office, securing her brother's trip home . The fate of one brother, Herbert, is almost entirely unknown. His records mark down that he died in a prisoner of war camp but both when are where remain a mystery to this day. It was in August, two months after Joseph's death, that James arrived in France as a driver, ferrying soldiers to and from hospital. It was a job he carried out for five months until, in January 1918, he was allowed to leave his post to return to England and then, in March, to Australia and his waiting family. He owed it all to Annie's letter, which moved officials enough for them to grant her wish. It read simply: 'I am writing to you to appeal for your assistance to ask you to send my brother No.1126 Driver James Bell 4th Australian Ammunition Sub. Park A.I.F., France back to Australia. 'He has been in the firing line three years and has a wife and two children in England receiving no separation allowance. Laurie Bell, right, died aged 22 in Gallipoli, while John Bell, left, died in Flanders on weeks later . The fate of Herbert Bell, left, is not fully known, while Joseph, right, the eldest brother, died in Flanders . 'He has had three brothers killed. Another has been missing two years last September. He is the only one left out of five brothers. 'Hoping to solicit your help.' Andy Wade, founder of the Keighly local history group Men of Worth, which researches soldiers from the area, said: 'The story of the Bell brothers is truly incredible. 'James’ sister made an impassioned plea to bring him home after the death of four brothers. 'She knew that if he had died in battle all five bothers from one family would be lost, and another wife would be widowed and children left fatherless.' The story remained a secret until it was brought forward by Jayne Pickard, great-granddaughter of Joseph Bell, whose father had researched the family. Jayne, 54, who still lives just doors away from where the brothers had their childhood home, said: 'It's an important part of my history, it feel strange to walk past the houses and know they lived there, I wish I knew more about it all. It's such a sad story but I am very proud of them.' James died many years later in Australia from natural causes.","The five Bell brothers all volunteered to fight in WWI .

"By . Sara Nathan . Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will tie the knot with actress Cheryl Hines tomorrow - despite the persistent rumors of his infidelity. In front of a crowd including matriach Ethel Kennedy, RFK Jr. and Cheryl will say I Do at the Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port, Mass. Today, Kennedy's cousin Patrick Kennedy, a former congressman, confirmed the wedding is planned for Saturday afternoon at Ethel's home, and said many members of the family are planning to attend. The wedding comes just weeks after MailOnline told how it was alleged that RFK Jr. nicknamed Bobby, had a two-year affair with Connecticut socialite Chelsea Kirwan - but revealed that the couple would still go ahead with the ceremony. Tying the knot: Despite allegations that RFK Jr cheated on Cheryl Hines with socialite Chelsea Kirwan, the couple - pictured in the Hamptons on July 4 - will wed on Saturday . Close: Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Cheryl Hines share a kiss ahead of their marriage . They're close: Cheryl Hines and her future mother-in-law Ethel Kennedy, soon to be husband Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Al Gore at the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights 2011 Ripple of Hope Awards dinner in New York . Mrs Kennedy: Cheryl Hines - seen with Ethel Kennedy - will join the iconic clan on Saturday . This will be the third marriage for Bobby, the son of the late senator Robert F. Kennedy and the nephew of President John F. Kennedy and the late Senator Edward Kennedy. The 60-year-old activist and his 48-year-old fiancee, best known for playing Larry David's wife on HBO hit Curb Your Enthusiasm and ABC comedy Suburgatory, have recently had an offer accepted on a $5million Malibu property - meaning Bobby may make the move from his home in Bedford, Connecticut to the West Coast. This is believed to be Bobby's way of showing his commitment to Cheryl following claims that he had cheated on her. While rumors had been swirling, Bobby's children are extremely fond of Cheryl and speaking at a movie screening last week, his daughter Kathleen 'Kick' Kennedy told the Daily News: 'It’s great (that they’re marrying). I love Cheryl, and I’m excited for our new family.' The budding actress revealed the couple had been disorganized, admitting: 'I’m trying to help the best I can. 'It's a fun wedding with two very fun people who aren’t necessarily always very organized. So I try to be there to pull everything together when I can. Maybe I’m a digit above everyone else (with organization) or something.' And she revealed that Cheryl had not even made her final choice of gown yet. However, Bobby could still be drawn into Chelsea Kirwan's bitter divorce from surgeon to the stars Laurence Kirwan as the mother-of-four faces a deposition and will likely be asked about her relationship with the Kennedy scion. Despite everything, the couple put on a display of intimacy when pictured in the Hamptons on July 4 - even wearing what looked like wedding rings, even though they have not yet said 'I Do'. On Monday, they were spotted at the John F. Kennedy Museum gift shop in Hyannis to buy gifts for the bridal party. And they have reserved a block of rooms at the Hyannis Harbor hotel for their guests. The hotel is a 500-room venue that lies on the ocean -and is booked out over this weekend. Meanwhile, photographer Dennis Reggie today tweeted: 'Honored to photograph another Kennedy family wedding this coming weekend in Hyannis Port. Bride is the gorgeous Curb Your Enthusiasm actress Cheryl Hines. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is the groom. 'Hard to believe but this makes over 25 Kennedy family wedding assignments over the years...can't wait.' Estranged: Surgeon to the stars Laurence Kirwan and his soon to be ex wife Chelsea at a party.

Robert Kennedy Jr, 60, is set to marry Curb Your Enthusiasm star Hines, 48, at his mother Ethel Kennedy's home in Hyannis Port tomorrow . Bobby has previously been married to Ruth Black, the mother of his children Robert Kennedy III and Kathleen, from 1984 to 1994 and then Mary Richardson, between 1994 and 2012. Mary, with whom Bobby had children Conor, Kyra, William and Aiden, committed suicide at her Bedford, New York, home  in May 2012. She was 52. In May 2010, Bobby filed for divorce from Mary after 16 years of marriage. Details of their divorce filing were kept private. In the past few weeks, alleged details of Bobby's private life have surfaced as he prepares to wed Cheryl. The  New York Post . has revealed that the environmental lawyer and activist, who works for Pace University and Riverkeeper, had contact . details for 43 suspected mistresses stored in his cell phone . It was reported he kept a list of dozens of . women filed under the letter ‘G’ in his cell phone, including both . Cheryl Hines and Chelsea Kirwan.. The . Post reported that Bobby's late wife, Mary told a friend . about the list just two months before she committed suicide. She is understood to have believed he had stored the names under ‘G’ because of the Italian slang for mistress - ‘goomah’. When RFK Jr had contact details for several women with the same first name, he would distinguish them by listing either their profession or city. His list included at least five women from Toronto and other in Paris, Palm Beach, Florida, and Aspen, Colorado. The Post contacted several women on the list, some of whom confirmed that they had met Kennedy. One described him as a ‘big flirt', while another described him as a ‘charming and talented man’, but denied that they had ever been romantically involved. Robert Kennedy's late wife, Mary Richardson, is reported to have shared details about a list of 43 suspected mistresses with a friend just two months before she committed suicide in May 2012 . This isn't the first time that details about RFK Jr's philandering has emerged. A 2001 diary belonging to him surfaced last September which helped gave a stunning insight into the number of affairs he had carried out during the same year that wife Mary had given birth to their fourth child. Bobby used a section at the back of his diary, headed ‘cash accounts,’ to list the first names of women he had cavorted with and gave each a mark out of ten. The list contains the names of 37 women, 16 of whom have the number ten beside them - which is believed to have signified that they had full intercourse. Alongside more prosaic details of Bobby's political activism and family life, there are startling admissions of his own feelings of guilt and remorse at repeatedly cheating on his wife. The 48-year-old actress and 60-year-old environmental activist took part in Fourth Of July celebrations in the Hamptons and didn't try to hide their gold bands ahead of their wedding this month . Time and again he wrote of how he felt tortured by his ‘lust demons’ as he described them. On days when he didn’t cheat, Bobby wrote ‘victory’ to signify that he had resisted sexual temptation. ‘I’m . like Adam and live in Eden, and I can have everything but the fruit. But the fruit is all I want,’ he wrote on Nov. 5, 2001. The thick, red journal was found at one stage by his wife, Mary Richardson Kennedy, who, distraught over their impending divorce and her husband's serial philandering, hanged herself in May 2012. The diary later found its way into the hands of the New York Post. When a Post reporter questioned Kennedy about the diary they were first met with a stunned silence before he denied having kept a diary during that year. ‘I don’t think there is any way you could have a diary or journal of mine from 2001,’ said Kennedy. ‘I don’t have any comment on it. I have no diary from 2001.’","Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and actress Cheryl Hines will wed on Saturday at his mother Ethel Kennedy's home surrounded by the Kennedy clan .

"By . Brian Viner . Parental concern: Brian Viner was shocked his son had been involved in the Neknominate craze . A few days ago, my 15‑year-old son Jake filmed himself mixing a cocktail in his own Wellington boot. Those who saw his video on Facebook would have witnessed him adding cold baked beans, a raw egg and a third of a bottle of vodka, before mixing it together and knocking it back in one. Welcome to the increasingly lethal world of Neknominate, which at the weekend claimed the lives of former grammar school boy Isaac Richardson, aged 20, and 29-year-old Stephen Brookes, from Cardiff. A week before it was linked to the death of two young men in Ireland. The Neknominate craze has primarily spread on Facebook - where else? - like the deadliest of viruses. The idea is that you film yourself drinking something horrible, then post the video online and nominate two friends to outdo you, giving them 24 or 48 hours to do so. If anything, Neknominate acts as a further reminder that for all the advantages the internet has brought us, it also encourages intelligent people to do incredibly stupid and reckless things. As a father of three, I find all this worrying in the extreme. Until last week I'd never heard of Neknominate, and certainly didn't know that my own son had partaken. I was predictably horrified when I found out;. Jake had always seemed perfectly sensible about alcohol, and appeared to have taken to heart my warnings about teenagers drinking too much. So this seemed like a rare but spectacular transgression, terrifying proof of the dangers of social media. I went to find him in his bedroom. 'Are you mad?' I exploded, having just seen the video. 'You could have killed yourself drinking something like that.' His eyes filled with tears. 'I couldn't,' he said. 'It was just a joke. It wasn’t real.' Allowed to continue: Facebook say the game isn't breaking any of their rules . While my son at first appeared to be one of those reckless people who had succumbed to the siren call of online 'fun', I was relieved to discover that the Stolichnaya Russian Vodka he appeared to be downing was, in fact, just water. He can be pretty daft, but he's not that daft. Sadly, one of his school friends mixed a different cocktail, containing cod liver oil, cat biscuits, ketchup and what appeared to be two shots of his own urine. He topped it up with beer and drank it down. Thanks to Facebook, Neknominate is spreading beyond even immature youngsters. One of my friends, Rusty, a businessman in his mid-50s, shamefacedly told me this week that he'd taken part. Far from being a bit of fun, the Neknominate craze is peer pressure of the most dangerous kind . He's a man with such a heightened sense of social responsibility that he spends a fortnight every year doing voluntary work in Africa. But after receiving a Neknominate invitation from his 20-year-old daughter on Facebook, and wanting to show that he was game for a laugh, a dad for all seasons, he rose to the challenge. He filled a pint glass with lager, cider, gin, milk, Marmite, salt and pepper and glugged it down for the amusement of his daughter and her friends, who later watched the footage online. 'Would I do it again now knowing that people have died?' he said yesterday. 'Probably not. I just thought it was a bit of fun.' But far from being a bit of fun, the Neknominate craze is peer pressure of the most dangerous kind. If highly educated, worldly, middle-aged fathers can submit to it, then what hope gauche, impressionable teenagers trying desperately to gain credibility with their mates? What makes it so seductive, and so hard to stop in its tracks, is how it spreads like online wildfire. Of course, one of the immutable facts of parenthood is that every father of teenagers has been a teenager himself. Even right into my 20s I sank the odd yard of ale, propelled not by extreme thirst but, yes, by extreme peer pressure. But in my own teens and 20s I always drank in a social situation. The great paradox of social networking is that there is actually nothing sociable about it. Jake was on his own in the house when he decanted my vodka and filled up his welly. And, unfortunately, just as the essence of the Neknominate game is for your nominees to go one step further, so must every generation outdo the one before. The Facebook generation have a kind of ersatz independence that is intoxicating for them in more ways than one . I first heard about dares involving grotesque mixtures of alcohol from my older son Joe when he came home from parties telling us about the phenomenon of the 'dirty pint'. This was a pint glass filled with a combination of things from the food cupboard if you were lucky, from the drinks cabinet if you weren't. My wife and I impressed upon him the terrible dangers of drinking mixtures of spirits, wine and beer. He indignantly told us that he would never be so stupid and would always refuse a dirty pint, no matter how much taunting might ensue. But the 'dirty pint' challenge has now moved online, and that is what makes it so much more dangerous. play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . Jake has now had the same lecture that his older brother received. But while we can give our children any number of stern warnings and even try to control what kind of parties they go to, we sadly have no influence over what they see on their computers and their smartphones. The Facebook generation have a kind of ersatz independence that is intoxicating for them in more ways than one. My daughter Elly is in her final year at university, about to embrace real independence. Elly has not yet been Neknominated, although, having started as a craze favoured by young men, it is now sweeping through her netball team. 'It's gone crazy,' she said. 'But don't worry, I won't do it.' Should know better: Grown men have been involved - so what hope do teens have to resist? But parents shouldn't only be worrying about their teenagers. If 15-year-olds are doing it, then what's to stop 12-year-olds or ten-year-olds? Which makes it all the more alarming that Facebook, as yet, has done nothing to stop or even vaguely discourage Neknominate. Worse, it seems to be profiting from it. Despite these tragic deaths, Facebook still displays adverts next to videos of people taking part in the drinking challenges. While it has removed advertising on Neknominate group pages (where individuals can discuss common interests in a collective forum) and does not show targeted advertising linked to the craze, this means Facebook is still profiting from people watching these clips. There is no suggestion that the companies involved know that their adverts are being placed alongside Neknominate videos, but Facebook will either receive a fee upfront or be paid each time a user clicks on the advert's link. There are many household names alongside the Neknominate videos, from the online shopping site ASOS to the University of East London, Vodafone to Citroen, and even the mental health charity Mind. It is, quite frankly, stomach-churning. So how can Facebook justify this? Facebook executives might contend that . the recent fatalities can hardly be laid at their door. It wasn't them . who forced those people to drink what they did, they might say . Well, it claims in its mission statement to monitor the 1.23 billion users active online every month, prohibiting 'content deemed to be directly harmful', while allowing 'content that is offensive or controversial'. Neknominate is certainly controversial, but is it 'directly harmful'? Facebook's definition of 'harmful' includes anything that 'directly inflicts emotional distress on a specific private individual, for example, bullying'. I'd say Neknominate falls pretty squarely into that category. After all, isn't peer pressure a form of bullying, and is there anything that inflicts greater emotional distress than death? I suppose Facebook executives might contend that the recent fatalities can hardly be laid at their door. It wasn't them who forced those people to drink what they did, they might say. But this position is a total abdication of responsibility. For the truth is that Facebook does have the power to delete or prohibit content on its pages, and has acted swiftly in the past to use it. It has, for instance, repeatedly come under fire for removing pictures of breastfeeding mothers, citing a violation of terms where photos feature a fully exposed breast. Just last year campaigners hit out at Facebook for also removing images of women who have undergone mastectomies because they were classified as 'pornography'. But when it comes to Neknominate, Facebook's stock response, even after the deaths this weekend, has been that while some people might find content offensive, it is not necessarily breaching any of the company's own rules. 'At Facebook we try to be a platform where people can share freely whilst still protecting the rights of others,' says a spokesman. 'We encourage people to report things to us which they feel breaks our rules so we can review and take action on a case-by-case basis. We also give people the ability to remove themselves from an uncomfortable conversation through tools such as untagging and blocking.' But as you see the endless roll-call of advertisers placed alongside the Neknominate videos which have had such a deadly impact on so many youngsters, you are tempted to draw the obvious conclusion: that Facebook could ban these extreme drinking videos if it wanted to - but its thirst for profits is too great.","Game has been blamed for death of number of young people .

"By . Sara Nathan . She launched her new lifestyle website Preserve amid great fanfare this week, admitting: 'I’m no editor, no artisan, no expert'. But Blake Lively's foray into foraging for the best of 'Main Street, USA', is having some teething problems as it draws critics over her top, somewhat eccentric, picks to buy. Perhaps the most bizarre object for sale so far is a $95 Porter Cycling wooden crate, similar to one you could pick up at the market. In flowery raptures, the boxes are described as: 'The bones of old New York get a new lease on life in these Dutch-style bicycle crates. Scroll down for video .

Indeed, as the Guardian points out, similar crates are on sale on ebay for just 99 cents, as writer Eleanor Robertson said the site just makes her 'want to each the rich'. Preserve: Blake Lively's new lifestyle website hasn't gotten off to the best start . Similarly, there is a crystal bowl for $450 by Jon McCoy designs that Blake assures us will impart 'beauty, imagination and warmth to those who welcome these captivating crystals into their home.' However, so far, many of the products on that site that seems to take inspiration from Oscar winner Gwyneth Paltrow's lifestyle haven, Goop, have imparted scorn. Fashion blogger BryanBoy tweeted: 'After visiting Blake Lively's new site, I'd like to preserve my dignity by preserving my opinions where the sun doesn't shine.' Salt-wise, the artisan salt collection by Laguna Salt is for sale at $40 is billed with the message: 'It's been said, variety is the spice of life. 'Diversify yours with this sensorily sophisticated set of splendid seasonings.' The pack includes a 'fantasia of far-flung flavors' including Tahitian Vanilla, Wild Ginger, and California Red salt, while varying flavors start at $10.

It's not just the carefully curated and crafted items for sale that have drawn scorn. An introductory video clip, which was created by Brian Rowland, which features a young girl writing in a journal underneath a tree while The Nature of Consciousness, a work by late British philosopher Alan Watts, is read aloud in the background, has been called a 'nightmare' by New York Magazine, which called the entire site a 'horror movie'. It seems Blake, 26, who made her name on TV hit Gossip Girl, gained inspiration for the website's name from her wedding day. The . star wore a couture Marchesa gown when she ecretly tied the knot with . actor Ryan Reynolds at Boone Hall Plantation in Mt. Pleasant, South . Carolina, two years ago. And . she recently revealed that the custom-made dress was damaged at her . wedding reception - though Ryan helped her cope with the disappointment.

Just what you always wanted! Speech bubbles by Scott Coppersmith range from $250-$300 . 'Florence Welch was singing at the reception, and they brought out these sparklers, and I’m watching her sing. I look down and my wedding dress has a big burn mark from one of the sparklers. Right on the front! And it was just so heartbreaking to me,' she tells Vogue in the magazine's August issue. She continued: 'And later, my dress was hanging up and Ryan said, ""Isn’t that beautiful?"" I said, ""What?"" And he pointed to the burn. My heart just stopped, because it was such a sensitive little subject. And he said, ""You’ll always remember that moment with Florence singing and the sparklers. You have that forever, right there, preserved."" Now that’s my favorite part of the dress.' She admits . she has found it hard to launch the site, writing in her editor's . letter: 'I’m more intimidated than I should probably admit. I’m no . editor, no artisan, no expert. And certainly no arbiter of what you . should buy, wear, or eat. 'I am hungry, though... not just for enchiladas. I'm hungry for experience. 'I'm . comfortable with the knowledge that I'm not a teacher, but rather, a . student. I don't do any one thing perfectly. I do a lot of things . though. Some well, some not-so-well.' Happy couple: Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds, seen here at Cannes in May 2014, have been married almost two years . If you want to be a SERIOUS chef, you need a $110 Butcher's apron - and perhaps a book of love letters to New Orleans for $35 . That's an expensive way to say I love you: A $300 'Marquee Heart' for sale on Preserve . According to Blake, she and her team think of the site not as a lifestyle website but a 'new street.' 'A sort of greatest hits of ""Main Street, USA"". While the whole world races to keep up with technology, we tighten our laces, join the race, but our end goal is to preserve what's already there. However, now that they both have lifestyle sites, don't expect Blake to start a war with Gwyneth. The Gossip Girl star recently name dropped her fellow online retail blogger, telling Vogue she is always in both the actress's and Martha Stewart's corner. Blake said: 'I’m always the first person to defend Gwyneth Paltrow. Or any woman in a position of power, like Martha Stewart or Oprah, who gets burned.

"By . Katy Winter . A 21-year-old has told how glamour modelling saved her from depression and gave her her life back. Rosie Doherty, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire,  used to suffer from panic attacks, anxiety and OCD when she was in school, making her life a misery. Her confidence plummeted and the situation became so bad that Rosie stopped attending classes. Rosie says glamour modelling is all about her transformation and her independence . But after she started modelling for lads' mags, Rosie shed more than just her clothes - she lost her anxiety too. Ironically one of the strongest sources of teasing was her lack of a chest - with other girls bullying her for her slow development. Rosie says: 'When I was 12, everyone else had boobs but me - girls used to laugh and call me 'AA'. 'It’s ironic really considering how things turned out. 'I suffered badly with depression - OCD, panic attacks and all sorts of things. 'I didn’t enjoy school at all - I had no self-confidence and didn’t want to see other people - in the end I just told my mum I wasn’t going.' Despite not turning up very often, Rosie still did well in her GCSEs, but it wasn’t until she turned 18 that her confidence began to return. Rosie, pictured aged 13, used to suffer from panic attacks, anxiety and OCD when she was in school, making her life a misery . Rosie boldly started her own career by approaching magazines with pictures she had taken herself . Rosie says she finds glamour modelling empowering and is proud to show off her body, flaws included . Following her 'feel the fear and do it anyway' motto, she took herself down to a promotional photo shoot. Armed with the pictures, she built up her portfolio and started sending them to the lads' mags and soon found herself garnering attention from the industry. She said: 'People say all these things about glamour modelling, but for me, it totally turned my life around. Rosie says her father has now come to terms with her career choice . 'A lot of that is to do with a feminist petition saying they were against it for objectifying, almost dehumanising, women. 'But for me it was absolutely the opposite. It was about female power, and taking a stand, and saying ""this is me, this is who I am, this is my body”. 'Seeing myself in those magazines had a massive impact on my confidence - I finally felt like me again.' However, her path into the industry hasn’t always been smooth, especially for her relationship with her father. Rosie said: 'When I first started he wasn’t happy because I’m his little girl. 'But I spoke to him and said, ""I’m a woman now, this is my choice, there’s nothing wrong with what I’m doing, and I want to be open and honest with my family”. 'Once we had that conversation he was happy with my decision.' She’s quick to point out that she doesn’t do modelling for an ego trip and shies away from flashing her flesh on social media. Rosie says it’s all about her transformation and her independence. Defiant Rosie said: 'I’ve got imperfections, scars and cellulite, just like any other woman, and I’m still putting myself out there. 'I’m not scared of people’s opinions or judgments - for me it’s about independence, taking charge of your own life, and just being comfortable in your own skin. 'You’re always going to be judged, from the first moment you step out of the house until you return.

Claire, who is married to B&Q worker Rob, 32, and also has son Jake, five, said she was delighted to have shared the birth date with Michelle, 29, again. She said: 'I was actually supposed to have Evie a week later but doctors decided they ought to get her out earlier and brought it forward to the same birth date as Michelle. We just couldn’t believe it. 'It is so lovely that we have been able to share this whole journey together. 'When we first had Ben and Henry I was able to offer Michelle loads of advice because I’d already done it before with Jake.

'They reached milestones, such as walking and talking at relatively the same time, and it was great to share those moments. 'It is lovely that this will keep on going and we will be raising our families together. 'We have decided in future we will have to combine birthday parties.

"By . Katy Winter . They say a girl should be able to depend on her daddy and luckily for one beauty therapist from Edinburgh that old adage was true. When Karla Torley became so fed up of being overweight she borrowed £10,000 from the bank of dad and went on to lose 9st after paying for a gastric sleeve operation. Despite previous attempts at dieting Karla had seen her weight balloon to 18st, requiring her to wear size 22 clothing. Scroll down for video . Karla dropped from 18st and size 22 (left) to a slim 9st and size 10 (right) following her operation . Karla says her social life as she grew up saw her often grabbing junk food for ease, and her weight steadily rose . After eight years of steady weight gain, Miss Torley, of Edinburgh, decided the best option was to have bariatric surgery. Having being told she was ineligible for NHS funding she decided to pay for the operation to be done privately with money loaned to her from her supportive father. Miss Torley said: 'My weight had got to the point where I was constantly feeling as if I didn't have any energy, and I was always unwell. I had taken to staying in, afraid of getting out and being active. 'One night I broke down and told my dad how depressed I was getting, and how I was thinking about surgery. He believed in me, and said I could lose weight purely through dieting. But when he saw I was serious about it, he did some reading into it and decided to come with me to a consultation.' Deeply unhappy with her weight, Kayla decided that weight loss surgery was the best option (left before, right, recently) Miss Torley saw her weight pile on as she fell into a cycle of comfort food and convenience eating.She said: 'I began gaining weight after the age of 16. I led a fairly hectic social life when I started going to college, and often it was easier to routinely grab time-saving food like pizza and takeaways. 'As my weight increased I became less energetic, and hid myself away, which led to comfort eating, so my weight just became more and more of an issue.' By 2012, Miss Torley was at her heaviest weight of 18st. She said: 'I was very upset about it. I didn't want to give in to the idea that I would be overweight forever, but despite dieting I just couldn't seem to do anything about it. One night everything came to a head and I told my dad about it. 'A week later he came back to say he had been doing some research and suggested we go to a consultation together to see what options we had.' The operation required Miss Torley to completely overhaul her daily diet, eliminating junk food . Miss Torley was told she would not be eligible for NHS funding, but discovered that a gastric sleeve procedure could be arranged privately. Her father Colin Torley, 53, eventually put the money up for the operation. Karla has no regrets about the operation and says her weight loss has given her her confidence back . She said: 'I didn't know whether it was going to happen or not, because £10,000 seemed like an awful lot of money, but dad said he would help.' Following the operation on January 10th 2013, Miss Torley lost 3st in six weeks. She said: 'I was so nervous before the operation because I had never done anything like it. I was in loads of pain after I woke up. 'It was great to see the results at the six-week check-up because I wasn't sure how effective the operation was going to be. As it turned out the effect it had was amazing.' The operation required Miss Torley to completely overhaul her daily diet. Before the operation, she typically ate nothing for breakfast, followed by a packet of prawn cocktail crisps mid-morning, then a portion of cheese and chips or a burger for lunch, with a cheese and onion pizza or Chinese takeaway for evening meal. She would snack on crisps or Galaxy chocolate during the day. Today, she eats Special K cereal with yogurt for breakfast, followed by soup with a small chunk of bread for lunch, and chicken stir fry for evening meal. She rarely snacks, but when she does she enjoys a small portion of soft cheese. Miss Torley is now a healthy 9st and can fit into size 10 clothing. She said: 'I've regained my confidence, and I love going shopping now. In my old life, I couldn't afford to buy clothes because I was spending so much on takeaways. 'It's taken some getting used to, and it hasn't been easy at times. I need to be careful to keep my protein levels up. I have no regrets whatsoever.

The IWC awards are considered one of the most prestigious and respected of competitions in the wine world, but the supermarket’s victory represents more than the knowledge that good wine ins available on the high street. The six-strong team behind M&S wines is all female, as women make more and more headway into this traditionally male-dominated industry. Marks & Spencer, led by a all-female team, has scooped top honours at the International Wine Challenge Awards . M&S won the Supermark of the Year award for wines such as Sancerre Les Ruettes (left) and the Underwood Pinot Noir (right) The last few years have seen a succession of women sip their way to victory with the past two winners of the renowned Palate contest being female. One member of the award winning wine making team from M&S, Emma Dawson says: ‘We are seeing more and more women at the top of the industry. 'The Master of Wine winemaker of the year was awarded to Anne Marie Leflaive, and increasingly, many of our winemaking partnerships include top winemakers from around the world who are women. Three of the all female team behind Marks and Spencer's award winning wines . ‘It makes perfect sense, as women have many attributes perfect for winemaking: they are said to have a more sensitive palate, which is crucial for tasting and blending; not to mention the ability to multi-task – ideal winemaking skill for when you have several parcels of grapes coming in during harvest. ‘ . Sue Daniels, another M&S winemaker agrees, saying: ‘Twenty years ago the industry was dominated by men, but as with many industries, there appears to be an upward trend in the amount of women in all areas of the wine industry such as sommeliers, wine buyers and winemakers - which has a positive effect. ‘I think women have been important in ‘de-fuddidising’ wine, in lessening the snobbism associated with wine, and concentrating on more important things – like taste, quality and value for money.’ Ana Sapungiu is set to hold the prestigious title of Master of Wine . Ana Sapungiu is soon to become a Master of Wine - there are only three hundred worldwide - and will be one of the youngest in the UK.

"By . Katy Winter . A woman who used to wear size 24 clothes has shed 6st in just 14 months after finding love at her slimming class. Liz McGuiness, 43, weighed 18st 7lb and was plagued with health problems because of her obesity. Surprisingly, despite being a Slimming World leader she was unable to shift her own extra pounds despite watching others slim down. Liz McGuiness weighed 18st 7lb (left) before joining Slimming World and dropping down to 12st 7lb (right) Liz met chef Paul at their SLimming World class and love soon blossomed between the overweight couple . Liz became so overweight that everyday tasks, even fitting into the bath, became a chore and she was suffering weight-related health problems . But then two years ago she met chef Paul, 52, at her own class in Wallasey, Wirral and love soon blossomed between the couple. And it was that love that finally helped Liz lose the weight she needed to. Since they have been together Liz has dropped five dress sizes and is now a size 12, weighing 12st 7lb. Thrilled Liz from Wallasey, Merseyside said: 'I am the lightest I have ever been in 23 years. 'I feel fabulous so much so that my head sometimes has to catch up with what I've achieved as I still see myself as a 'big' person. 'People walk past me all the time and don't recognise me and when I say it's me they are astounded. 'It is still almost unbelievable to me to be buying size 12 clothes and them fitting whereas before I would just grab any size 24 and pray that it fitted me. Keen to look her best alongside her new man, Liz started a food optimising eating plan with Slimming World. The plan encourages members to eat foods that satisfy the appetite and are low in energy density for example vegetables, pasta, potatoes and lean meat. Liz says that Paul's support was crucial in helping her drop from a size 24 (right, holding her old jeans) to a slim size 12 . Liz said: 'I've been a weight loss leader for ten years and Paul had been an on and off member for a few years. 'He came back a few years ago and wanted to lose the weight he had put back on. 'A friend of mine got in touch and said that Paul really liked me but was too shy to ask me out for a drink in case I said no. 'But we went on a date and when we had our first kiss I just knew that he was the man for me. 'He admitted that despite wanting to lose weight the real reason he came back to the group and came every week was to see me.' The road to her stunning figure has not been easy and even as a Slimming World leader, Liz struggled to stick to the diet that has ultimately seen her waistline shrink. Liz is now helping Paul lose weight, and he has already lost 15lb of his goal of 8st . The diet displays 'free foods' which can be eaten without weighing or measuring. Whereas higher density foods such as chocolate and crisps are controlled by a 'syns' counting system and each member is allowed a certain amount of syns per day. She said: 'As a slimming world leader it was a bit embarrassing that I was giving all this advice to my members but not following it myself. 'I always thought to myself I wonder what they think about me being in this job at the size I am. 'All through my childhood I was called the chubby one. 'I even remember teachers saying I was chubby and over the years as I have got bigger that complex has stayed. 'Everyday life became a chore and everything was an effort to the point where I couldn't even fit in the bath properly. 'I couldn't put my shoes and socks on properly and was putting on weight in places that really freaked me out like my knees and the back of my neck.' Liz is hoping to now enter the National Slimming World Consultant Slimmer of the Year competition after her dramatic weight loss. She said: 'I knew I needed to do something about my weight and having Paul spurred me on. 'I knew that being overweight even if I was in a happy relationship would affect my self-esteem. 'It gives me such a buzz when Paul tells me how proud he is of me and he is so supportive of my weight loss. Liz is now helping her boyfriend to fight the flab. Chef Paul Partridge said: 'I am very proud of Liz's weight loss and I think she looks amazing.'My aim is to loose enough to be comfortable doing things I may struggle with now, for example to go places and sit comfortably in seats like the theatre and on planes. 'I want to make Liz be as proud of me as I am of her. ' Paul has already lost 15lb in just one week and hopes to lose a further 8st to get to his goal weight. She said: 'Hopefully I can help Paul with his weight issues and make him feel as good as his encouragement makes me. 'We are both in the mind set to lose weight now so we make sure if we go out for to restaurants we are making healthy choices. 'It is easy to fall off the wagon with diets but Paul is really good and doesn't tempt me with any naughty foods. 'We are a good combination and are just as loved up as we were when we first met.'","Always larger, Liz joining Slimming World when her size started making daily life difficult .

As last year's Miss Birmingham Rachael Barker impressed so much in the role that she now works full-time for the organisers of Miss England. The 25-year-old is now in charge of organising the Miss Birmingham, Miss Black Country and Miss Worcestershire competitions. Rachael Barker impressed so much in her role as Miss Birmingham that she now works full-time for the organisers of Miss England . She was offered the job on stage in April as she handed over her crown to her successor, Katie Stamps. 'They said they'd never had a beauty queen do the job before, previously it was someone from the Miss England organisation,' she said. 'But they said they were really pleased with everything I did in my year in office and thought I'd be perfect for the job.' Next year's Miss Birmingham is expected to be held in February, but Miss Worcestershire is scheduled for September or October. And Rachael, a University of Birmingham psychology graduate, is already on the hunt for suitable candidates. Rachel impressed the Miss England organisers so much that they offered her a job organising more pageants . She said: 'Whenever I see a pretty girl I want to tell them: 'Enter my beauty pageant'. The University of Birmingham psychology graduate is already on the hunt for suitable candidates . 'There's . still a stigma about beauty pageants - people think it's like it was in . the 1970s with girls parading in swimsuits and talking about world . peace. 'But it's changed so much. 'There's no swimsuit round and it's all about raising money for charity and building confidence.' Rachael, from Quinton, originally entered the Miss Birmingham contest in 2009 and was runner-up.

Rachael lives with her boyfriend, Tim, who works as a doctor at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital. 'I want as many girls as possible to enter because last year for Miss Birmingham we only had 22 entrants - ideally we need around 40,' she said.

"By . Katy Winter . There have been many, much applauded steps within the fashion industry to move away from the ultra-thin ideal for women. However, most models and store mannequins are still extremely thin, and now an example has come to light of a store popular with young girls using a dummy resembling a seriously underweight woman. Budget fashion house Primark has promised to change a window display after a customer tweeted a picture of an anorexic looking mannequin. The mannequin in question was clearly the image of an underweight women, with obviously protruding ribs . Concerned shopper Mel Fraser tweeted a picture of the skeletal dummy after spotting it in the shop window of the Glasgow branch. Wearing a bikini and printed trousers, the shockingly thin mannequin’s ribs were clearly protruding. Ms Fraser tweeted a picture of the dummy to bosses at Primark who tweeted back, promising to look into the matter straight away. She wrote: ‘ Dear Primark, is it really necessary that these new mannequins have protruding ribs? ‘And before I get anyone saying I’m skinny bashing, I’m not, I’d just like to see mannequins in all different shapes and sizes in all stores rather than young girls thinking this is the only way to be.’ Concerned shopper Mel Fraser tweeted a picture of the skeletal dummy after spotting it in the shop window of the Glasgow branch . Her picture and caption was quickly re-tweeted more than 1400 times and Primark bosses thanked Ms Fraser for bringing the matter to their attention and promised an investigation. They tweeted back: ‘Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We’ll speak to our team tomorrow. Can you please let us know what store this was pls?’ Fitness instructor and mother of one Ms Fraser said she felt using only overly thin mannequins sent a worrying message to impressionable young shoppers. Primark responded to the complaint and now says it will change it's window display . She said: . ‘Primark shoppers tend to be young fashion conscious girls and I’m . concerned that it sends a dangerous message to impressionable teenagers. ‘If . you are going to have mannequins that are thin then they should at least be . presented alongside other body shapes so not to enforce the message . that very thin is the only desirable or acceptable body shape for . women.’ Other twitter users also slammed the store. With users branding the use of the mannequin as ‘shocking, ‘disgusting,’ and ‘utterly terrifying.’ But others were quick to defend Primark with one user asking: ‘ What if you are naturally skinny, does that mean you can’t be represented?’ Earlier this year luxury Italian linger label La perla came under fire after a customer tweeted a picture of a mannequin on display in New York . Ms Fraser insisted she was merely calling for more of a ‘variety’ of shapes to be represented to send a safer message. Yesterday the store announced: ‘We are currently changing our window displays.’ In a tweet to Ms Fraser bosses said: ‘ The mannequin you describe will not be used in this way again.’ Primark is not the first store to be lambasted for the use of thin mannequins. Earlier this year luxury Italian lingerie label La perla came under fire after a customer tweeted a picture of a mannequin on display in New York. Gap and Zara have also come under fire in the past. In 2007 Spanish label Mango agreed not to display mannequins smaller than a size 6 because: ‘Problems with eating disorders among Spanish Women.’","Dummy in Glasgow shop has protruding ribs .

"By . Katy Winter . A woman has lost a massive 6st after the office clown cracked a joke about her looking like an elephant. Sharing exciting holiday stories, Anna Grainger, 52, showed a photo on her phone of her riding an elephant in Thailand. But as soon as her back was turned she could not help overhearing the comment from the joker, 'Which one was the elephant again?' Anna Grainger showed this photo of her riding an elephant in Thailand to her work colleagues, prompting the cruel comment: 'Which one is the elephant?' It was the final straw for 17st 7lb Anna, who at just 5ft 2in had a dangerously high BMI of 44. She decided that it was time to turn her life around by taking control of her eating and her body. Today she is a healthy size 12 and has lost 6st. Anna said: 'I had never felt confident in my appearance - I wouldn’t even wear jeans until my thirties as I hated my shape. 'But after I heard that joke I knew it was time to take control. 'As I started to lose weight, my confidence grew and I met my now husband Tim online. 'Setting the date for the wedding spurred me on with my weight loss, and when we tied the knot in June last year I felt amazing as a size 12.' Anna weighing 17st 7lb (l) and in the studio having lost 6st (r) Anna, from Morton, Lincolnshire, had always been big and cannot remember a time when she ever felt confident in herself. Her weight spiralled out of control after her first husband died of a heart attack in 2010. She said: 'I took comfort in a spiral of overeating and it just made me feel worse about myself. 'Looking back, I think I was probably suffering from depression. 'After the comment at work I decided to go on the Cambridge Weight Plan because I knew a woman that had already been successful.' Anna’s dramatic diet involved her substituting meals for milkshakes and soups, but it was done safely under supervision from her doctor. Anna, pictured with her daughter Tamar Minor, began overeating after her first husband died of a heart attack in 2010 . She lost an average of four pounds a week and found her confidence growing. Before long Anna met Tim online in a car forum and they went on their first date to a Volkswagen car show. Anna said: 'I was worried what Tim would think of my dieting, but I needn’t have been. He wasn’t afraid to say how lovely I was. 'Tim proposed in September 2012 in Brighton. I saw a vintage dress that I knew was the one but it wouldn’t even go over my head. Anna, left on her wedding day with husband Tim, lost an average of four pounds a week and found her confidence growing . Anna and Tim married last June at the Brighton pier, with Anna in her dream vintage size 12 wedding gown . 'I was determined to get into it and with the wedding on the horizon my resolve strengthened.' Anna’s son and daughter, Sam and Tamar Miners, 27 and 24, joined her on the CWP and between the three of them they have now lost 12 stone. Tim and Anna married in June 2013 at Brighton Pavilion. Anna said: 'It was a wonderful vintage wedding and it even featured on Rockn’Roll Bride blog. 'I had read the blog for years but never dreamt I would be in it.

"By . Katy Winter . A mother was so mortified when her eldest son called her a 'jelly belly' that she dropped five dress sizes in five months. Rebecca Nelson, of Baldock, Hertfordshire, weighed 16st and wore size 18 clothes when her son Kurt, now 7, made the innocent remark, which prompted her to join a gym and slim down to the 10st 10lb she is today. Miss Nelson, 28, said: 'Kurt didn’t mean any harm. He was only joking around, in the way that children do. If I’d burst into tears he would have felt bad, but I laughed it off. Scroll down for video . Rebecca has dropped from 16st and size 18 (left) to a slim 10st 10lb and a size 8 (right) Rebecca found her weight rose during her pregnancies, collecting increasingly round her middle . 'In truth l found it a bit upsetting. It was the kick I needed to make the change.' Miss Nelson, also mother to Reggie, four, and Seth, two, began gaining weight as she fell into the routine of motherhood. She said: 'When I was pregnant I would eat for two, even though I didn’t really need to. Being pregnant was a bit of an excuse. After I had Seth it was really difficult to shift. Rebecca decided to tackle her weight after her eldest son made an innocent comment about the size of her stomach . 'I’d never been overweight when I was younger, but when you have children, things change. I found myself staying up late after the kids went to bed, when it was easier to order a takeaway or cook something from the freezer.' Miss Nelson, a former saleswoman, found much of her excess weight collecting on her waistline, leading to an unsightly bulge around her stomach area. In the winter of 2013, Miss Nelson was lying on the sofa where her sons Kurt and Reggie rushed in, in a playful mood. She said: 'Kurt pushed my tummy and said, ""mummy’s got a jelly belly!"" 'If I’d heard him say it to anyone else, I would have told him he was being rude, but I couldn’t bring myself to tell him off. He was only being silly, and being honest.' (left: Rebecca's stomach when she was at her heaviest weight, right: her stomach now) In November that year, Miss Nelson attended the wedding of the sister of her partner, David Cornish, 31, a car bodyworker. She said: 'When the official photos came back I was horrified because I looked so overweight. The unposed photos which appeared on Facebook later were even worse. It was the final straw.' Miss Nelson joined Slimming World on January 2nd this year and cut all the takeaways out of her daily diet. She said: 'I’ve built a routine where I can go out for one night on the weekend when I can enjoy life and eat what I like. Then in the week, it’s straight back on the diet. It’s worked really well for me. Rebecca at a wedding -- the picture which was the final straw which persuaded her to lose weight. At the front is Kurt, with his brother Reggie beside him, and Seth above . 'I started going to the gym every morning at 6.30am. To start with I couldn’t run for 30 seconds at time, but now I run five kilometres each time I go on the treadmill.' Rebecca now also goes to the gym nearly everyday . Miss Nelson’s routine meant she shrank five dress sizes in five months, today weighing a slim 10st 10lb and wearing size 8 clothes. Before beginning her weight loss regime, Miss Nelson ate nothing for breakfast, followed by a chicken tikka baguette with cheese and onion crisps for lunch, then breaded chicken with chips and beans for her evening meal. Her favourite snack was a bag of Hula Hoops, with a dollop of mayonnaise and grated cheddar cheese on top. Today, she has yoghurt with fruit for breakfast, followed by chicken salad for lunch and home-made shepherds pie for evening meal. Now, Miss Nelson has a toned stomach which she maintains through a combination of dieting, cardio exercises and weight training. She said: 'I recently went to the bingo with my friends, where I saw my grandad. I waved at him, but he didn’t recognise me. He looked at me as if I was a complete stranger. He said I was a bit too thin when he realised who I was. 'I love the changes I’ve made. I’m so much more energised. When I think back to time when I could only run for 30 seconds at a time, I can hardly believe how far I’ve come. 'I’m grateful to Kurt for making that cheeky comment. Coming from someone so innocent and honest, it was ultimately quite helpful.'","Rebecca began 'eating for two' while pregnant with her first child .

"By . Katy Winter . A pair of knickers and matching bra have been created which seem to slightly take away the point of underwear. Detailing the anatomy of the female reproductive system and the breasts, the pant and bra set is similar to the more simple ‘nipple bikini’ which hit headlines recently. Part of the ‘Free the Nipple’ movement which aims to end the stigma surrounding female bodies, the bikini caused a stir as celebrities like Cara Delevingne shared pictures of it online. Scroll down for video . The bra and pants make up Eleanor Haswell's piece 'Why are you so afraid of your anatomy?' The pants detail the female reproductive organs including the ovaries, vagina and uterus . However the 'Why are you so afraid of your own anatomy?' pieces go a step further by showing all parts considered ‘taboo’ about the female form. The work of young artist Eleanor Beth Haswell, 18, from County Durham, the vagina pants and bra are part of her growing portfolio of art inspired by gender inequalities. One set of pictures, entitled 'Prick', shows a woman with thorns instead of underarm hair, aiming to highlight upon the constant narrow-minded views that it is somehow an abnormal occurrence for a woman to have body hair. Speaking to MailOnline Eleanor says: ‘The main influence for me for this piece is the divide that's been made between genders. 'I began to notice a lot more shaming online, the amount of negative comments gathered online is incredible. It's often that you hear the typical slut-shaming comments about girls who choose to do what they want with their own bodies. Another set of pictures by Eleanor entitled 'Prick', shows a woman with thorns instead of underarm hair, . Model Cara Delevingne posted a second picture of a topless couple standing next to each other denoting the anatomical similarities between the male and female nipple to her six million followers . The model also posted this image of a woman in a flesh coloured bikini top complete with realistic nipples in support of the Free the Nipple campaign . 'This piece isn't being gender specific suggesting that only women have this particular anatomy, but it is to highlight upon the major difference in our society. It's to question those who think it's acceptable to shame one gender over another - who decides whose nipples are accepted for the world to see. 'There always comments being made about women who have body hair, who have cellulite, anything that doesn't live up to the standards set by society. 'This is pushed on to us from an early age, the amount of comments made about women who have chosen to have body hair disgusts me. It is one of the most natural things, everyone has it yet it is constantly frowned upon. 'It's the 21st century and women are still constantly feeling pressured to live up to these expectations of what is attractive, and it shouldn't have to be that way; it's all down to personal choice.'","Artist created anatomically correct underwear to end taboo around the female form .

"By . Katy Winter . A mother-of-two lost almost 11st in weight after she discovered she was too large to wear an airliner seat belt. Donna McKenna, 32, was jetting off to Gran Canaria for a summer break when, to her horror, she found she could not stretch the regular-sized safety belt across her lap as the plane prepared to take off. Mrs McKenna, of Portsmouth, was forced to endure the humiliation of being fitted for a brightly-coloured extra-large belt extension by a flight attendant. Following the birth of her son Ryan in 2008, Donna found it even more difficult to control her weight gain and before long her health was beginning to suffer . Donna began dieting, bringing her weight down from the 22st 7lb she was at her heaviest to the 11st 8lb . Stung by the experience, Mrs McKenna began dieting, bringing her weight down from the 22st 7lb she was at her heaviest to the 11st 8lb she is today. Last week she returned from a holiday in Turkey where she was able to wear her bikini with pride in the wake of her amazing transformation. Mrs McKenna, a children’s nursery receptionist, said: 'The seatbelt extension was bright orange and the attendants were having to make a fuss of me. I felt as if all eyes were on me - it was a horrible feeling. 'Once we . got to the Canary Islands, the holiday was miserable, too.. I was barely . brave enough to venture outside of the hotel room and I certainly . didn’t want to go anywhere near the swimming pool.' Mrs . McKenna saw her weight increase as she settled into a comfortable life . with her childhood sweetheart Neil, 31, a supermarket manager, whom she . met when she was a teenager. She . said: 'Life was very easy-going. We didn’t shy away from having treats - . I was particularly drawn to crisps and chocolate. By the time we . married in 2006, I was 17st' Mrs McKenna saw her weight increase as she settled into a comfortable life with her childhood sweetheart, Neil . By the time Donna and Neil got married in 2006 her weight had already reached 17st . Donna decided she had to tackle her weight when the family took a trip to  the Canary Islands and she had to have a special seat belt because of her size . Donna used to eat a cheese pizza with chips and a packet of crisps for lunch, with a ready-meal of spaghetti carbonara for an evening meal . Following the birth of the couple’s son Ryan in 2008, she found it even more difficult to control her weight gain and before long her health was beginning to suffer. She said: 'I started to struggle with mobility. Ryan was always very active and it was difficult keeping up with him. It became Neil’s job to take him to the park. 'It was a shame to go to the park and not be able to go on the swings with him, like any other mum. I began to feel quite sad and guilty about that. 'When I felt bad I would go home and comfort eat, which made me get larger, so it became a vicious circle.' Now, at 11st 8lb and wearing size 10 clothing, she is at the lowest weight she has ever been in adulthood . In the summer of 2010, when she was four months pregnant with her daughter Isabelle, now three, Mrs McKenna was at her largest size, weighing 22st 7lb and wearing size 26 clothing. It was then that the family decided to have a holiday to the Canary Islands, which involved a short flight. Mrs McKenna said: 'I tried to get comfortable in the plane seat but I struggled to fit into it. 'I might have been four months pregnant, but I knew I should have been able to fit into the chair anyway. 'In that moment I knew I had to do something. 'I waited for a while - until Isabelle was six weeks old - before I started to diet properly. But from then on, I’d committed to making a change.' Mrs McKenna joined her local branch of Slimming World and within the first week she had lost five pounds. Over the course of a year she lost nearly seven stone. She said: 'I was so nervous before the first class. If it wasn’t for the fact that my mum Christine was with me for moral support, I don’t think I would have got through the door. 'After all that worry, they were a really nice group and they made me feel welcome. I got loads of support from them. 'Changing my diet so dramatically took quite a lot of getting my head around, but once you figure out what you’re doing and start to see the results, it’s easy. Success really spurs you on for the following week.' Before beginning her weight loss journey, Mrs McKenna typically ate nothing for breakfast, followed by a cheese pizza with chips and a packet of crisps for lunch, with a ready-meal of spaghetti carbonara for an evening meal. Throughout the day she would snack on crisps and Galaxy chocolate. Today, she typically enjoys scrambled egg or a serving of Bran Flakes for breakfast, followed by chicken or ham salad for lunch, with lean chicken and steamed vegetables for an evening meal. When she snacks, she enjoys bananas and apples. Now, at 11st 8lb and wearing size 10 clothing, she is at the lowest weight she has ever been in adulthood. Breakfast: Nothing . Lunch: Cheese pizza with chips and crisps . Dinner: Ready-meal of spaghetti carbonara . Snacks: Crisps and chocolate . Breakfast: Scrambled eggs or bran flakes . Lunch: Chicken or ham sandwich . Dinner: Lean chicken and vegetables . Snacks: Bananas and apples . She said: 'Neil’s extremely proud and full of praise. He’s hugely encouraging. 'It’s easier to keep up with Ryan and Isabelle. Ryan loves running around with me - he remembers me as I was before and loves seeing his mum so healthy and with such energy.' Last week, Mrs McKenna returned from a triumphant family holiday to Turkey, where she was able to enjoy the beachside with full body confidence. She said: 'I was able to get into a bikini. It was so nice to be able to do that. It felt amazing to think that no-one was looking at me. 'As I was boarding the plane at the start of the holiday, I had a flashback to the time when I couldn’t stretch the seat belt across me. This time, as I pulled the seatbelt across, I had to pull it tighter as it was left too big from the previous passenger. 'My legs weren’t squashed against the arm and I finally felt comfortable where I was. I couldn’t help smiling.'","Always larger, Donna found her weight rising as she got older especially after the birth of her children .

Melinda Gates and Dawn O’Porter have all shown their support for the . campaign. Girls who marry before they turn 18 are less likely to remain in school and more likely to experience domestic violence . More than 130 million girls and women have experienced some form of FGM in the 29 countries in Africa and the Middle East where the harmful practice is most common . Ahead of the summit the world's first Insta-documentary, created from global Instagram submissions, was unveiled . The moving film sees people describing freedom, including one woman who says: 'Freedom is riding a scooter through Rome' Girls who marry before they turn 18 are less likely to remain in school and more likely to experience domestic violence. Young teenage girls are more likely to die due to complications in pregnancy and childbirth than women in their 20s; their infants are more likely to be stillborn or die in the first month of life. ‘The numbers tell us we must accelerate our efforts. And let’s not forget that these numbers represent real lives. While these are problems of a global scale, the solutions must be local, driven by communities, families and girls themselves to change mindsets and break the cycles that perpetuate FGM and child marriage,’ Lake said. ‘We can’t let the staggering numbers numb us – they must compel us to act.’ Ahead of the summit the world’s first Insta-documentary, created from Instagram footage, was unveiled in honour of girls affected by child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation (FGM). The 2:20 minute Insta-film, ‘Freedom Is…’ is calling for an end to these harmful practices and was created from Instagram submissions from across the world, including contributions from UK, USA, Italy, Greece, Armenia, Ethiopia and Zambia, submitted in response to a social media campaign asking the question ‘Freedom is…?’ David Cameron and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley have both pledged support for the Girl Summit . The film explores the impact of restricting freedom, especially for girls who are subjected to forced marriage and FGM, and encourages viewers to sign the Girl Summit Pledge (www.girlsummitpledge.com) to help end these harmful practices within a generation. The moving film sees people describing their own freedom as 'riding a scooter through Rome', 'swimming with my son', the freedom to be myself', and 'being free of hate greed and ignorance' before looking at those who have their freedom taken from them through FGM or forced marriage. The Girl Summit Pledge has received over 4,500 pledges and 34,000 social messages of support and has reached 286 million people to date, with support also secured from Mia Farrow, David Cameron, Bip Ling, Jon Snow and Sasha Wilkins, .

"By . Katy Winter . While most people like to blame fast food restaurants like McDonald's for any extra pounds they might be carrying, one overweight man found working for the company actually helped him slim down. Colin Moore, 27, of Spennymoor in County Durham, was so worried when his weight hit 24st that he asked doctors for gastric bypass surgery. He was told he would be put on a waiting list and, faced with a long delay, decided to begin a regular diet. Colin dropped from 24st 7lb (left) to 14st 7lb (right) just through changing his diet . After losing 8st, he began working at McDonald’s where, ironically, being around fast food all day gave him the motivation he needed to reach his target weight. He said: 'I was dangerously overweight and needed to do something about it. I thankfully lost the weight myself so didn’t need a gastric band. 'Working at McDonald’s put me off the burgers, helping me reach my final goal.' Mr Moore was not overweight as a young boy but when he was ten years old he began getting bullied at school, which led to him hiding in his house and eating for comfort. He said: 'I wouldn’t go out and play and instead stayed at home. So I got bigger, which meant I was bullied more. Colin struggled with his weigh from a young age, being bullied at school because of his size which caused him to continue overeating, reaching over 20st (left) before losing nearly half his body weight (right) 'When I started secondary school the kids started called me The Penguin, like Danny DeVito from the Batman film. 'I suffered from depression and anxiety. As I grew up I wouldn’t go out, I didn’t work and I wouldn’t socialise. 'As I’ve grown up it’s always been in my mind. My weight loss has been for myself, but also to prove those bullies wrong.' In 2012, when Mr Moore was 22st, his uncle died from a smoking-related illness. He said: 'The shock urged me to stop smoking but within five months I had gained another two stone.' Mr Moore ballooned to over 24st 7lb and went to doctors in May 2013, hoping to be referred for a gastric bypass. He said: . 'I had lied to myself for a long time and refused to believe that I was . so big. When I was weighed and knew it for certain I knew I had to do . something drastically. 'I felt a gastric bypass was the only option. It was laziness though - I was taking the easy option.' He was . told by doctors that although he was eligible for the procedure, he . would need to join a long waiting list. Motivated by a desire to turn . his life around, Mr Moore began dieting. Mr . Moore said: 'I have never looked back since that day. I cut out all of . the rubbish foods such as crisps, biscuits and fizzy pop. 'I got a beautiful dog called Buddy. He’s a springer spaniel who needs constant walking - so that keeps me moving.' Breakfast: Nothing . Lunch: Two burgers and chips . Dinner: Whole meat feast pizza . Snacks: Crisps, sweets and 2litres coke . Breakfast: Fruit . Lunch: Ham sandwich and rice cakes . Dinner: Chicken and vegetables . Snacks: Has eliminated fizzy drinks . In his first month Mr Moore lost 18lb. Between May and November 2013 he lost a further 8st and dropped from a 46- to a 38-inch waist. Mr Moore said: 'It gave me confidence to go outside. I wasn’t working at the time and it gave me the confidence to go out and get the job at McDonald’s.' Working surrounded by the smell of burgers overloaded Mr Moore’s senses and put him off fast food completely. Mr Moore’s weight continued to drop off and he lost another two stone while working at the fast food restaurant. Mr Moore, who still works at McDonald’s, . said: 'It helped with the weight loss. Since I have worked there I . haven’t eaten any burgers. You get a free employee meal as standard, but . I choose not to eat it. Colin shows off his weight loss in an old T-shirt (left), his waist has shrunk from 46in to 38in. Walking his dog Buddy (right) helps keep Colin active and moving . 'I have nothing against McDonald’s but I like the way I am now and I know if I ate the burgers there’s no way I would stay at this weight.' Before beginning his weight loss, he typically ate nothing for breakfast, then two burgers with chips for lunch. For dinner he would often eat whole meat feast pizzas to himself from his local takeaway, and would snack on beef crisps, sweets and a two litre bottle of full fat coke. Today, he . typically eats a piece of fruit for his breakfast. For lunch he will . have a ham salad sandwich with rice cakes. For dinner he now goes for . the healthy option of chicken with boiled vegetables or a healthy curry. He has also cut the fizzy drinks out of his diet. Now . only 14st 7lb, he has lost so much weight that he dropped a shoe size . due to the loss of body fat. His waist has dropped to size 34. People who . Mr Moore has known for years now walk past him in the street as he is . so unrecognisable in his new form, and he says that losing so much weight has given him a new lease on life. He said: 'I’m more confident and outgoing, I actually want to be around people now. 'I enjoy going out and shopping because I can now find things which fit.'

"By . Katy Winter . A woman who was told she was too big to be a model has proved the critics wrong by landing her dream job - despite being bigger than she was before. Mother-of-three Charlotte Joines first attempted her modelling career aged 22, but failed to land a contract with an agency because her size eight figure was deemed too big. Ten years on and Charlotte has finally landed her dream job as a swimwear model, despite now being a size 12. Scroll down for video . Charlotte, who was told she was too big to be a model, has proved the critics wrong by landing her dream job - despite being bigger than she was before . At size 12 Charlotte won a national competition and now is pursuing a career as a swimwear model . Charlotte, now 32, said: 'The lady at the agency took a long hard look at my thighs and told me they were too big. 'I’d been surviving on just Weetabix and going to the gym five times a week so that was the final straw. 'I already had one child then and I was sacrificing too much. I had no energy and I was grumpy all the time.' Charlotte, from Portsmouth, decided she wanted to become a model after getting fed up of her boyfriend Floyd looking at other women in magazines. She said: 'I thought I’ll give him something to look at - I can do that. 'So I had some shots done and sent them off to everyone. I got a few jobs but I kept getting knocked back from agencies. 'People said it was the nature of the industry and I should have known was I was letting myself in for, but every one took a little bit out of my confidence. Video provided courtesy of Curvy Kate . Charlotte entered the competition to represent Curvy Kate with three friends, Camilla, Ellesha and Rufaro, and the group were chosen as the winners by singer Sarah Harding and photographer Dan Kennedy . After winning the competition, Charlotte took part in a bikini photo shoot despite have only having given birth four months previously . 'I was exhausted and snappy, so when I got told I was too big I just couldn’t do it any more. 'Now I’m a size 12 and the most happy and confident I’ve ever been. I do think that confidence helped me to achieve my modelling dream.' Charlotte took a break from modelling until she spotted a competition on television for a group of friends to model for underwear brand Curvy Kate. She entered with three of her friends, never imagining they would get anywhere. Instead they were invited to attend the semi-finals in London for a photo shoot by celebrity photographer Dan Kennedy and competition judge Girls Aloud’s Sarah Harding. Charlotte and her friends modelled the brand's latest swimwear looks on their shoot in Ibiza . Mother-of-three Charlotte says she has never felt more confident with her body . Charlotte said: 'To be honest we thought it was just going to be a nice day out for me and my friends. 'We hadn’t seen each other for a while and thought it was a great opportunity to catch up, so we were shocked when they told us we’d got through to the final. 'The final was live on television and we were still convinced we wouldn’t win so it came as a huge shock.' Charlotte, along with her friends Camilla Andersen, 27, Ellesha Newton, 28, and Rufaro Nyakatawa, 29, won a shoot in Ibiza and is now a swimwear models for Curvy Kate. Charlotte said: 'When we had the shoot I had only give birth four months before so I was petrified. 'I had a wobble and nearly didn’t get there but it was great to have all my friends round to support me. 'I’m a size 12 now and the happiest I’ve ever been. Curvy Kate makes me feel like it doesn’t matter what size you are as long as you’re happy.

"By . Katy Winter . A teenage girl who weighed more than Mike Tyson lost a whopping seven stone - after taking up boxing . Courtney Clarke, 18, piled on the pounds after gorging on crisps and sugary snacks washed down with litres of full-fat coke. At her heaviest she tipped the scales at 19st when she was just 10 years old and was taunted by school ground bullies about her bulky size. Courtney Clarke has dropped from 19st and a size 20 (left) to 12st and a size 12 (right) since taking up boxing . Courtney won her first bout in Birmingham last November when she defeated a fighter 25kg heavier than her . Courtney used to eat secretly throughout her childhood (pictured left and right at 14; right with brother CJ, nine) But she had the last laugh after she took up boxing and shed 7st and became a champion fighter. Courtney, from Tamworth, Staffordshire, now weighs a muscular 12st and has gone from a size 20 to a size 12 in the four years since taking up the sport. She said: 'I would eat breakfast, eat cereal bars on the way to school, crisps and chocolate at break and have a school dinner, as well as some extra food I brought in from home, for lunch. 'Then, I would go home after school and have some sandwiches or crisps before tea, have tea and often secretly eat at night too. 'I have always liked watching boxing on the TV but never really thought I would ever actually do it for real but my friend persuaded me to give it a go. 'I was nervous when I first stepped into the ring but I really got into it. 'I was getting compliments from family and friends and people noticing I had lost weight straight away really but it took me a good couple of months to realise. I didn’t feel any different at first. Training up to five times a week, Courtney was delighted when she realised the weight was falling off her . Now Courtney is setting her sights on making the British Olympic boxing team in Rio . 'It was only when I went shopping with mates that I realised I was too small for the usual size 18-20 clothes I was buying. This was a big boost for my confidence. 'I was very surprised but it spurred me on to train even harder. 'I was training Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays for one and a half hours each day - sometimes longer - at the club.' Courtney, who has just completed a sports coaching qualification at college, won her first bout in Birmingham last November when she defeated a fighter 25kg heavier than her. She is now setting her sights on making the British Olympic boxing team in Rio in two years time. She added: 'It was a very welcome to lose weight through boxing. It has always been a hobby so to lose weight because of it too has been wonderful. 'My ultimate dream is to box in the Commonwealth or Olympic Games.'","Eating in secret caused Courtney's weight to rocket in childhood .

"By . Katy Winter . Growing up with three slim sisters Holly McHale, 25, always felt like the 'ugly duckling' having struggled with her weight from a young age. After two of her sisters got married, the office manager from Shrewsbury resolved to make a lasting change to her lifestyle and spent £10,000 on bariatric surgery. Having once weighed 21st and worn size 24 clothing, today she is around 13st and can fit into size 12 dresses. Holly dropped from 21st and a size 24 (left) to 13st and a size 12 (right), following gastric surgery . Holly's size meant she felt ugly next to her older sisters and it was also affecting her health . She said: 'My sisters never teased me, but I struggled with my body image since I was young. I was always the larger sister. 'I wanted to look like them because they always looked so beautiful and graceful. Today I’m much happier with the way I look, and I feel amazing.' Holly’s weight began to shoot up after her father Michael died when she was just 11 years old. She said: 'I was the one who found dad after he died and it was very upsetting. We were very close. 'My mother was so keen to look after me that she gave me everything I wanted. She was sad for me that I didn’t have my dad anymore, so she treated me with things like sweets and hot chocolate after school. 'It created a link in my mind between comfort and food that didn’t go away. I thought I would lose my puppy fat but I never did.' By the time Holly reached college, she weighed 16st and became the subject of bullying. She said: 'I was made to feel worthless and my self-esteem hit rock bottom. I was drawn to takeaways and convenience food. Things like Chinese and Indian food, takeaway sandwiches, burgers and chips, fried chicken, and bag after bag of salt and vinegar crisps.' Holly has three older sisters - Katie, 35, Lucy, 32, Aimee, 30 and in June 2010 Aimee became the first of the sisters to get married. Holly said: 'It was wonderful seeing my sister get married but I was devastated that I looked so overweight. An individual photograph was taken of me and I insisted it was taken out of the wedding album. I was so humiliated.' From left to right: Holly, Aimee's husband Keith, Aimee, Katie and Lucy on Aimee's wedding day . Holly decided to spend the £10,000 inheritance money she received following her father’s death on weight loss surgery to drastically decrease the size of her stomach (left, before, right, now) By the following summer, when her sister Lucy got married, Holly weighed 21st, her heaviest weight, and was wearing size 24 clothing. She said: 'I just wanted to look more like my sisters, because they looked so wonderful and happy. I’d struggled even to find a nice dress I could fit into. 'I’d tried dieting, but despite signing up for slimming classes, I’d always put on weight after losing a few pounds. 'I investigated getting surgery on the NHS, but I didn’t fit the criteria for the area I was in.' Undeterred, Holly decided to spend the £10,000 inheritance money she received following her father’s death on the extreme surgery. Holly, pictured here with her mother Barbara and sisters (from left to right, Aimee, Barbara, Holly, Katie, Lucy), used over eating as a form of comfort after her father's death . She said: 'At my heaviest I was struggling for breath and scared even to go outside. At one point I spent three months inside my house, terrified to leave the front door. 'I knew it was the right decision, but my family was scared for me.' Following the operation in January 2012, during which doctors removed three-quarters of her stomach, Holly began rapidly losing weight. Today, she weighs just over 13st and can fit into size 12 dresses. Prior to the operation, Holly typically ate leftover Indian or Chinese takeaway for breakfast with hot chocolate or biscuits as a morning snack, followed by a jacket potato with noodles and a chocolate bar for lunch. Dinner was a Chinese takeaway with a tub of vanilla ice cream for dessert and she would snack on salt and vinegar crisps throughout the day. With her new slim body Holly now feels confident and healthy and just as beautiful as her sisters . Today, she typically eats a fruit smoothie for breakfast, followed by a rice cracker with tuna and onion for lunch with a greek yoghurt for dessert, and chicken with steamed vegetables for dinner. She rarely snacks. Three months ago Holly met her boyfriend forklift driver Steven Harvey, 33. She said: 'He’s amazingly supportive, and knows all about my weight loss. He said he would love me no matter what size I am - I’m amazingly lucky. 'I’m so happy with my new body. I feel happier and more energetic, and no longer feel ugly compared to my sisters. 'I know dad would be amazingly proud of me. He would utterly approve of the changes I’ve made, there’s no doubt about it.'","Holly used overeating as a form of comfort after her father's death .

"By . Katy Winter . An artist has been arrested in Japan for scanning a 3D version of a selfie she took of her vagina and distributing it to supporters, to allow them to build kayaks in the form of her anatomy. Megumi Igarashi made her own kayak using a 3D scanner, which you can see in the photo below. However her feminist agenda has been . curtailed by her arrest, which occurred when she emailed the 3D scan of . her private parts to 30 people. Scroll down for video . Megumi Igarashi inside the completed vagina kayak, based on a 'selfie' she took of her own anatomy . Megumi took a picture of her vagina which was then scanned into a 3D printer to allow it to be printed out and then built . She also makes a wide . variety of sculptures and art featuring painted or imprinted vaginas, . which she calls Manko, crude Japanese slang for the vagina. On her blog Megumi, 42, made a plea for money to enable her to move on from art made from hand moulds of her vagina. She wrote on her blog: ‘Mould by hand is not suitable for making large art pieces such as a door, a car, or a boat. I was wondering how I can make it possible, and then I finally found that 3D scanner can make it happen easily!' ‘A 3D scanner can be used to make a boat that will go across the ocean! 'But the problem is the technology and the cost. I cannot afford it nor use the scanner alone. ‘So here is my request for your support to make the world’s first 3D scanned vagina boat that goes beyond the seas.’ While, by evidence of these photographs, it seems Megumi did receive adequate funding for her bizzare and ambitious project, it led to her falling foul of the Japanese obscenity laws. Other items she has fashioned using her vagina as part of her Decoman project include jewellery (bottom right), as well as numerous small 'scenes¿ in which tiny model men are posed on grass covered moulds of her vagina . Website Kotaku reports that she is currently being held by police in Tokyo. Other items she has fashioned using her vagina include a lampshade, a remote-controlled car, and a smartphone case, as well as numerous small ‘scenes’ in which tiny model men are posed on grass covered moulds of her vagina. On her blog, where she writes about her work and exhibitions under the pseudonym Rokudenashiko which roughly translates to ‘bad girl’ or 'good-for-nothing girl', Megumi says: ‘I thought it was just funny to decorate my vagina and make into a diorama, but I was very surprised to see how upset people get when they see my works or even hear me say the word Manko. 'Manko and vagina, have been such a taboo in Japanese society. Penis, on the other hand, has been used in illustrations and has become a part of pop culture. 'But vagina has never been so cute. Vagina has been thought to be obscene because its been overly hidden; although it is just a part of a woman’s body.'","Megumi Igarashi is a Japanese artist who makes art using her vagina .

"By . Katy Winter . A woman lost 12 stone after choosing to have two thirds of her stomach removed to allow her to fulfil her dream of having children. Lisa Durrant, 33, of Burwell in Cambridgeshire, opted for a sleeve gastrectomy after years of dieting and even gastric band surgery failed to work. Miss Durrant opted for the irreversible procedure after she found her size was causing her health problems and, crucially, affecting her fertility. Lisa dropped from 21 stone and a size 28 (left) to a slim 9 stone and size 10 (right) After . having the gastrectomy done privately, her weight more than halved from . 21 stone to nine stone in just over two and half years - and she is now . trying for a baby. Lisa . said: 'It may be permanent, but I have never regretted the surgery and I . don’t think I ever will. I feel so much better now and I can’t wait to . have children.' Miss Durrant said the weight piled on as she turned to treats for comfort food during her teenage years. She . said: 'I don’t ever remember being a normal-sized child - I’ve always . been larger. At school I was bullied and it was a vicious circle. I ate . because I felt sad, but as my weight increased, I got bullied more.' Lisa used to use food as a form of comfort; treating herself to junk food like crisps and sweets . Miss Durrant would snack on multipack crisps and Haribo sweets as a form of comfort. She tried diets but could not shift the weight. As she grew older, she became increasingly concerned about how her failing health was affecting her ability to have children. She stopped having regular periods at the age of 17, in what doctors suspected was a case of obesity affecting ovary function. She said: 'I’d really wanted kids since I was 19 and if I hadn’t been able to have them I would have been devastated.' In 2007 Miss Durrant even had a gastric band fitted, but it was removed in late 2010 after doctors found it was corroding away, putting her stomach wall at risk of serious damage. In August 2011 she opted for a sleeve gastrectomy which involved having two thirds of her stomach removed through keyhole surgery at a hospital in Australia, where she was then living. Lisa (pictured back row far left) stopped having regular periods at the age of 17, in what doctors suspected was a case of obesity affecting ovary function . Lisa began dropping a stone a month after her drastic sleeve gastrectomy, which reduced the size of her stomach by two thirds (left, before her weight loss, right, today) The operation, which was covered by her private health insurance, cost £4,000. She said: 'The outcome was permanent and there was no going back once I’d made the decision. 'It was a big decision, but I was so unhappy being overweight that I knew it was what I needed to do. 'I couldn’t sit in cinema seat and plane seats were always a problem. It was so embarrassing and I felt so self-conscious. 'I didn’t worry about the operation, I was more worried that my obesity would kill me. If I went on a short walk I would be out of breath. If I went up a few steps then I would start to feel extremely unwell. Breakfast: McDonald's muffin . Lunch: Large sandwiches and cakes . Dinner: Whole Pizza Hut pizza . Snacks: Crisps, sweets and chocolate . Breakfast: Small bowl of cereal or fruit . Lunch: Ham salad wrap . Dinner: Vegetable and meat casserole . Snacks: Very occasional sweets . 'Every single day I wished there was something I could do about it.. The surgery seemed like the only possible option.' From the date of the operation to today, Miss Durrant has lost more than 12 stone, and her dress size has shrunk from a size 28 to a size 10. Before beginning her weight loss, she typically ate McDonald’s muffins for breakfast then large meaty sandwiches and cakes for lunch. For dinner she would often eat whole Pizza Hut pizzas to herself and would snack on crisps, sweets and chocolate. Today, she typically eats a small bowl of cereal or fruit for her breakfast. For lunch she will still have a ham salad wrap or pasta but it will be spread out throughout the day as she can no longer eat it in one sitting. She said: 'At first it felt a bit strange as I was used to being able to eat a whole pizza. Now I eat two slices and feel stuffed.' Losing so much weight caused Miss Durrant's periods started again and is planning on having children with her new partner . Miss Durrant found that her weight loss began gradually but soon she was regularly shedding more than a stone each month. She said: 'The decision was definitely the right one. If I had to make the decision all over again I would.' With her new-found confidence, Miss Durrant decided to leave an unhappy life in Australia and move back to the UK to be with her family. She said her brother did not recognise her when he picked her up from the airport. She said: 'I went to my cousin’s house for a visit not long after I got home, and she asked who I was. 'Even now, family members have to double-take. They are so happy for me because I’m healthier and happier.' Since moving back to the UK she has found a new partner who loves her new thinner form. Losing so much weight caused Miss Durrant’s periods started again and the couple are planning on having children together. After losing weight so quickly she had been left with a lot of excess skin which she is planning to have removed by doctors. She said: 'I feel absolutely fantastic, I have a lot more confidence than I ever had before.'","Having always struggled with her weight, Lisa used food as a comfort .

"By . Katy Winter . As the run of There's A Monster In The Lake continues, to stellar reviews, Cressida Bonas seems to be setting her sights on securing her next role. The 25-year-old enjoyed the balmy evening after last night’s performance at the Rosemary Branch Theatre in London by joining director Mike Figgis and others for a drink. Looking in excellent spirits the blonde hugged several people, chatting animatedly with Mike in her colourful midriff-baring outfit. Cressida Bonas, ex-girl-friend of Prince Harry, outside the theatre, which sits above a pub, with director Mike Figgis and actor Daniel Bruhl . Cressida, wearing a bright summery outfit that showed off her lean legs and toned stomach, warmly embraced the esteemed director . Cressida, Mike and Daniel chatted following the performance, in which Cressida plays a mystical wolf . The esteemed director is known for films such as Leaving Las Vegas, Cold Creek Manor and One Night Stand. Nominated for two Oscars, he is highly respected within the industry - getting a part in one of his films would be a huge triumph for the aspiring actress. Cressida, who wore a blue crop top teamed with a turquoise mini-skirt - showing off those toned legs - must hope that her performance last night impressed Figgis. The actress also talked to Inglorious Basterds actor Daniel Bruhl who had attended the performance and enjoyed a beer with the cast and Figgis afterwards. After drinks and chatting with friends and cast Cressida walked to the tube station with friends . Clearly in a jubilant mood, the 25-year-old enthusiastically embraced a friend, while Mike and Daniel looked on . Cressida wore her hair lose and minimal makeup for the brief pub session, and was not seen to indulge in a drink . After the drinks, down-to-earth Cressida walked to the tube station with friends. There's A Monster In The Lake, which was directed by Lily Ashley, and written by Tallulah Brown, follows the tale of an elderly man who, tired of his life in a nursing home, enters a fantasy world where he ends up marrying the Queen of the Woods. Cressida plays the wolf that guards the way between the two worlds and by all accounts is able to stretch her legs as a comic in the role. Cressida Bonas cut an athletic figure as she headed to her theatre performance of There's A Monster In The Lake in London earlier in the day . The blonde beauty carried a can of Coca-Cola as she made her way to work . And this foray onto the stage is just the first step of what looks to be a promising acting career for the blonde. Cressida has recently signed on to do a movie with Dame Judi Dench and Cara Delevingne called Tulip Fever. But these successes have not been come off the back of her high-profile royal relationship. Cressida studied dance at Leeds University and acted in a production of Othello there that was so acclaimed it was taken on to Edinburgh Festival. Earlier in the day, Cressida was seen stepping out in her white Frame Denim dungarees for the second time in a week. This time around, the all-in-ones got an outing at the park, where Prince Harry's former flame giggled madly as she was swung around by a friend. She then changed into her blue shorts and cropped top before heading to the theatre for her evening performance, enjoying a cola as she strolled in the sunshine.","Cressida currently performing in 'There's A Monster In The Lake' in London .

"By . Katy Winter . A women was motivated to dramatically transform her body after doctors warned that her huge size was hindering her chances of starting a family. Siobhann O’Brien, 23, from Failsworth, joined a gym seven months ago to transform her body and kickstart a healthier life. Today, the receptionist weighs 13st 8lb, a huge . loss of six stone in only seven months, which includes an impressive 13 inches off her stomach, nine inches off her hips and a total of 12.5 . inches from her legs. Having struggled with her weight since childhood, Siobhann found her 19st 10lb frame was impacting her health and daily life . Siobhann has now shed over six st through changing her diet and exercising (right in her old shorts) Having always struggled with her weight, Siobhann was repeatedly sent to hospital dieticians as a child in an attempt to curb her weight gain, but to little effect. 'I was a real bread fiend. And I was never happy with just one thing, I would order lots of things just in case I wasn't satisfied. 'At work in my bag I would always have KitKats or crisps. I just always had food with me.' Siobhann's stodgy, carbohydrate heavy diet saw her weight continue to rise as she got older, impacting her daily life. Doctors advised Siobhann that her weight would prove problematic, especially as . she had been diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome at the age of . 16. Siobhann used to find even walking a struggle and used to often carry food with her in case she got hungry . Siobhann was so large that even basic tasks like getting dressed presented a challenge and she worried it was effecting her fertility . Now at 13st 8lb and going to the gym five times a week, Siobhann says she feels so much better . 'I had a lot of back pain and even walking was an effort. 'Some days my boyfriend had to help me get dressed and put my socks on and I just thought ""I'm only 23, why am I like this?"" 'We had been trying on and off for five years to start a family and nothing was happening. I went to the doctor and he said my weight was playing a major part and that for each stone I lost, my fertility would increase.' Of her transformation she recalls: 'One of my friends referred a Personal Trainer at a local gym. We had an initial meeting and talked about various goals and reasons why I wanted to start training. 'At my first weigh in I was horrified to see 19st 10lb on the scale with 48 per cent body fat!  My first session was agony, even simple things like stepping up and down on a box step was torture. 'The trainer then put me a full diet plan and even went shopping with me to educate me on the right foods to eat so I could implement this into my life.' She added: 'Losing this weight is one of the hardest things that I have had to do, gruelling personal training sessions with Lee pushing me to my limits, sometimes I felt like crying and giving up but with determination and encouragement I managed to push on resulting in a massive transformation in my life.' Breakfast: Lots of white bread with eggs or cheese ham and pickle sandwiches . Lunch: French bread baguette with a mayonnaise based filling and a pasty or pie . Dinner: Large portion of homemade curry or creamy pasta with lots of cheese. Ready meal pudding . Snacks: KitKats and crisps . Breakfast: Porridge with fresh blueberries . Lunch: Chicken with sweet potato and green vegetables . Dinner: Chicken or tuna steak with a small portion of brown rice and broccoli . Snacks: A handful of nuts like almonds, yogurt or fresh fruit . Siobhann’s personal trainer and General Manager at PureGym Manchester Moston, Lee Greenall, says: 'It’s been terrific to see Siobhann’s change, her courage and will is inspiring and she’s a testament to what hard work and commitment can result in. 'It has been a pleasure to work with her and the whole team are looking forward to continuing to help Shiobhann realise her full potential.' Shiobhan now eats a low carbohydrate, high protein diet and goes to the gym around five times a week, doing a wide variety of exercising. 'I feel so much better in myself, and my hair and skin are miles better. It's amazing how much of an impact diet can have on your life.' Shiobhan now hopes to continue to lose weight before trying for a baby again soon.","Siobhann struggled with her weight from childhood and was diagnosed with polycystic ovaries at 16 .

"By . Frances Hardy . Fisherman Ivor Charles cuts the engine of his sailing boat on a gently swelling sea beyond Weymouth Harbour, so all we can hear is the sound of the waves. ‘Listen!’ he whispers. ‘Hear that gurgling sound? That’s the boat singing to us.’ And so it seems. There is no lullaby as gentle as the quiet lapping of water against the sides of a small boat. Ivor, 75, runs up the main sail. The breeze tugs at it. It bellies out and we’re off, gliding on a current of air. Seadog: Fisherman Ivor Charles has become the go-to man for Hollywood film scouts hoping to give authenticity to nautical scenes by including sea-faring men . He reels in his fishing lines. All along them, like jewels on a necklace, hang a shoal of mackerel, silver and iridescent green. Below in the cabin, Ivor’s mate David Parrott, 63, brews coffee. We warm our hands on mugs of it. Above us, in a cold, bright sky, an early winter sun shines. ‘Pure Heaven,’ declares Ivor. And that’s just how it seems. Ivor fell in love with the sea 65 years ago; now it runs in his blood, a briny tide. And if you were to ask anyone, the world over, to describe an old sea dog, they’d paint a verbal picture of him: a face craggy and weathered by salt and sea air; snowy hair and a white beard; twinkling eyes as blue as a summer tide. Which is why, when Hollywood film scouts . are looking for sea-faring men — sailors, fishermen, sea captains, . pirates — to give authenticity to nautical scenes, Ivor is their go-to . man. And why, late in life, he has a burgeoning career as an extra in . big-screen movies. Hollywood calls: Ivor spruced up as the captain of the Titanic for a TV documentary during his burgeoning career as an extra in big-screen movies and TV programmes . Ivor has worked alongside a veritable galaxy of A-list stars. His credits include Dark Shadows, Tim Burton’s 2012 gothic comedy starring Eva Green, Michelle Pfeiffer and Johnny Depp, who plays a 200-year-old vampire. Ivor portrayed a fisherman in the film as he also did in Snow White And The Huntsman, a 2012 fantasy based on the Grimm’s fairy tale and starring Charlize Theron, Kristen Stewart, Chris Hemsworth and Bob Hoskins. Spruce and neatly barbered, he was . elevated to Captain Smith of the Titanic in a 2012 National Geographic . documentary film Titanic: Case Closed. He even had a line (‘Carry on, . Murdoch’) to deliver to the doomed ship’s First Officer. He . appears, too, in Da Vinci’s Demons, a British/American collaboration . for TV in which he brings realism to a dockside scene as a beggar. And . his most recent call was to Pinewood Studios, where he will play a . fisherman in Disney’s remake of Cinderella, directed by Kenneth Branagh, . with Helena Bonham Carter as the fairy godmother and Lily James, of . Downton Abbey, as Cinders. But . how it all came to be is a story in itself. For decades, Ivor — . long-since divorced with three daughters and 11 grandchildren — has . garnered a reputation as a local celebrity on the picturesque quayside . of Weymouth, Dorset. You’ll find him there most days on his boat, . Humdinger. Worked alongside celebs: Ivor portrayed a fisherman in film Snow White And The Huntsman, a 2012 fantasy starring Kristen Stewart, Charlize Theron and Chris Hemsworth (left to right) A-listers: Ivor has worked alongside a veritable galaxy of A-list stars including Michelle Pfeiffer (left) and Johnny Depp (right) in Tim Burton's 2012 gothic comedy Dark Shadows . A lithe man, . upright as a ship’s mast, in navy blue Guernsey and reefer jacket, he . sits among barnacled lobster pots, smoking a roll-up. Sightseers . are drawn to him. Many ask to photograph him and he is always happy to . say ‘yes’ as long as they donate £1 to the RNLI. Indeed, one recent . summer’s day, he reckons he raised about £85 for the lifeboats. But he made the leap into films by . accident, when five years ago production workers on Richard Curtis’s . film The Boat That Rocked — set in 1966, it features a fictitious pirate . radio station — arrived in Weymouth to recruit extras for a sea rescue . scene. Ivor was walking . along the seafront to his boat when he saw the queue of hopefuls waiting . to audition outside a hotel. He bumped into a friend who told him the . extras were wanted for background shots and needed to ‘blend in’. ‘I told him: “I’d be no good for that. I stick out like a sore thumb.” ’ But . as he stood having a smoke and chatting, he was approached by a man . with a clipboard who encouraged him to apply. ‘So I thought: “Why not?” And that’s how I got the job.’ He beams a toothless smile. There are . only two teeth in Ivor’s head. ‘I did have three, but I pulled one out . with a pair of long-nosed pliers only last week. It was giving me gyp.’ Ivor . took to filming like a boat to water: he featured in the Richard Curtis . film as one of the crew of a fishing boat that goes to the rescue of . the pirate radio DJs in a storm. ‘One of my grandsons told me: “Grandad, I saw you in the film — for all of five seconds!” ’ He chuckles. Extras career: Mr Charles with fellow fisherman David Parrott stand beside their boat in Weymouth, Dorset . It might have ended there, were it not for Ivor’s friend Svetlana Savrasova, a keen amateur photographer, who persuaded him to enrol with Mad Dog Casting, an agency specialising in extras with character. Thereafter, the work rolled in. ‘I never need make-up,’ says Ivor, . proudly. Indeed, his sea-blown characteristics are so perfect, one . make-up lady refused to trim his beard after he asked her to. She told him: ‘My notes say: “Don’t touch his beard. Don’t touch his hair. Don’t touch a thing.” ’ Ivor’s . interpretation is: ‘They’re too polite to say it, but I’m scruffy and . that’s exactly the look they want. But I’ve lived with this face for 75 . years. I wouldn’t change it now.’ Indeed, . the casting agents were so impressed with Ivor that they asked Sevtlana . if she knew any more Weymouth fishermen who might also want to become . film extras. After placing . an advert in the bistro where they go for breakfast, lots of men came . forward. The agency recruited 12 — Ivor’s friend Dave Parrott among them . — and they were asked to grow Ivor-style beards. ‘So any fisherman you . see hereabouts with a beard has most likely been in a film,’ says Ivor. Beginning of his movie career: Ivor got his first extras job working on Richard Curtis's film The Boat That Rocked after the film crew arrived in Weymouth to recruit extras for a sea rescue scene . They hired a minibus to go to Pinewood Studios  to film Dark Shadows and later, Snow White And The Huntsman. Ivor’s friend Kevin Nurrish, 60, who appeared in both films, remembers the fanfare when they turned up on the set, a replica of a harbour town in New England. He says: ‘Someone shouted: “Everyone stop! The Dorset Fishermen have arrived! They’ll show you exactly what happens on a boat!” ‘They’d even imported American seagulls which had to be looked after by a specially employed seagull wrangler.’ The high-point for Kevin was sitting during a pub scene next to veteran actor Christopher Lee. ‘Johnny Depp was there, too, filming until 2am. He chatted with us and was lovely to everyone,’ says Kevin. They even shared a pint with film producer Richard D. Zanuck who was responsible for such hits as Jaws and Driving Miss Daisy (Dark Shadows was his penultimate film before his death last year). A photo of them all is displayed in Ivor’s local, The King’s Arms, on the harbourside. ‘See that knife stuck in the table?’ Ivor says, pointing to a lethal looking blade in the photo. ‘That’s my best filleting knife.’ Memorable moment: A high point in Ivor's career was sitting next to Christopher Lee in a pub scene . Out on the sea, sailing past oil tankers, fishing boats and the Condor cross-channel ferry, Ivor is most at home. He and David, friends for almost 50 years, share reminiscences about their filming exploits. David remembers: ‘During filming of Snow White And The Huntsman, the producer told Ivor to say to me “That’s the huntsman” every time one actor rode by. The third time he said it, I said: “Yes Ivor. You’ve already told me twice. I know it’s the blooming huntsman!” Ivor said: “You silly b****r, I’ve been told to say that!” ’ Then there was the occasion their friend, fisherman Peter Matthews, newly recovering from a cataract op, was called on to man a fish stall on the set of Snow White. ‘And he was blinking and grimacing because of the eye op,’ says Ivor, ‘and they says to him: “Yes, that’s brilliant. Wink at the lady customers just like that!” ’ The little boat is rocking with their laughter. Ivor and David are a double act, united by their love of the sea. Every weekend, David deserts his wife Penny to go sea fishing with his friend. ‘My wife spends a lot more on her pleasures than I do, but I enjoy myself more,’ he says. ‘Come Friday, I’m still smiling from the weekend before.’ Ivor concurs: ‘I’m never happier than when I’m out on the water. And filming’s a good life, too. We just mess around with nets and fish like we would do anyway.’ I wonder what characters Ivor would like to play next. ‘I could be the new Captain Birdseye,’ he says, ‘only a slimmer, trimmer version. And if Johnny Depp makes another Pirates Of The Caribbean, I’d love to be in that. ‘In fact,’ he smiles, ‘they need look no further than Weymouth for the whole cast. The Dorset Fishermen could supply a complete crew.’","Fisherman Ivor Charles has worked with actors including Johnny Depp .

"By . Frances Hardy . David Bond wanted to know how much his five-year-old daughter liked TV. 'A hundred billion per cent,' declared Ivy. 'Why?' asked her dad. 'Because it's so relaxing,' she said, while maintaining constant eye contact with the screen. Screen zombies: British children like David Bond's spend an average of four-and-a-half hours a day glued to a screen . Meanwhile, her brother Albie, three, was so immersed in a film on his iPad he did not register a flicker of interest when the word 'chocolate' was hissed in his ear. When David turned off the TV, confiscated the iPad and breezily announced they were going out for  a walk in the fresh air, there was rebellion. Ivy and Albie screamed in unison. They drummed their little heels against the sofa. David had to wrestle them into their coats and wellingtons and manhandle them into the Great Outdoors. This little scene is not unusual. On the contrary it is typical: children in Britain spend an average of four-and-a-half hours a day glued to a screen of some sort, and 'outside' is a world as unappealing to them as it is alien and dull. A recent survey by the National Trust found that three times more children could identify a Dalek than a magpie. Herculean task: David is trying to make the natural world as enticing to children as the many brands that demand their attention . The impact of a sedentary lifestyle is alarming on many levels. Inactivity can lead to obesity, depression and behavioural problems. This summer, the British Heart Foundation called for a return to a 'traditional outdoors childhood' to prevent today's children from being the first generation in history to have a lower life expectancy than their parents. Spurred on by the fear that his own children were joining an army of 'glassy-eyed zombies' who would, if left to their own devices, become fat, depressive couch potatoes, David, 41, a film-maker, decided to act. He appointed himself to the ambitious, fictitious post of Marketing Director for Nature, setting up an office in the shed of his garden in South-East London. Then he began the Herculean task of trying to make the natural world as enticing to our children as the many brands that clamour daily for their attention. His quest to get his children outside is charted in his new film, Project Wild Thing. But how can conkers, leaf snap and rolling down grassy slopes compete with Disney, Nintendo and iPads? At first, it seems, they can't. For one of the film's first scenes after he is faced with his unenthusiastic children, David goes to a school in Eltham, South-East London, to meet a class of similarly sceptical 12-year-old girls. 'What do you think of nature?' he asks hopefully. One girl tells how she was forced by her parents to go for a walk in the rain. It is a sartorial horror story. 'My mum made me put on a waterproof jacket and she pushed up the hood. It was all crinkly. I looked like a walking crisp packet.' There are appalled gasps. Bravely, however, he persuades the girls to go outside. For a while they kick their heels  and affect sophisticated indifference. They mistake a hawthorn for a sycamore. Then something miraculous happens. They start to enjoy themselves. There is laughter. They run around. They make daisy chains. This, it seems, is the point: when children can be shoehorned out of their chairs and into the outdoors, it actually makes them happy. But how? David devised a Wild Time app to tempt Ivy and Albie (pictured with mother Kate) and other children into the outdoors . 'When children recall the most memorable times of their lives, they don't remember days sitting in front of computers,' says David. 'Their favourite days were spent outside, having adventures. Every tree is a climbing frame, every shrub is a den.' So what did David do? He devised a free Wild Time app to tempt  children to make the bold step from the imagined world into the real one. The app, for computers and mobile phones, suggests ideas for things to do, according to the amount of time you have to spend. Got a minute? Spot a bird. An hour? Go on a treasure hunt. Collect feathers, stones and leaves. And Ivy and Albie, it seems, took the bait. Before David embarked on his project, he strapped a camera to Ivy's head to find out exactly how she spent her time. 'My inner geek needed numbers to work with,' he says. 'I discovered that Ivy spent more than a quarter of her spare time on screens and just 4 per cent of it outdoors; the same proportion as she spent in the bathroom.' Eighteen months on, Ivy, now six, and Albie, four, spend 15 per cent of their time outside, almost four times as much as before. Success! This means that David and his  wife Kate, 41, a publisher, have also become more active and outdoorsy. The transition from inside to out was not, as David wryly observes, 'a walk in the park'. Success: Eighteen months on, Ivy and Albie spend almost four times as much time outside as they did before . 'After the initial screaming and tantrum-throwing there was quite a bit of grumpiness and dragging of heels from the children,' he says. 'We weren't suggesting we all went and lived wild in the woods, but even small changes have a profound effect. 'We started by going out and discovering the wild places near our home. We went to Nunhead Cemetery, one of the Magnificent Seven cemeteries in London. It's overgrown and very wild.' Hmm! I can imagine the exaggerated eye-rolling that would be provoked in most households if mum and dad proposed a stroll in a graveyard. But David and Kate persisted, with gratifying results. 'The idea was not to make it too structured,' says David. 'Middle-class childhood can be an overwhelming exercise in scheduling, which is madness when you consider that what children really like is a complete absence of structure. 'So we'd take along sketch books and pencils, perhaps a picnic. We gave the children a cheap camera so they could take their own photos. 'We're always surprised by what grabs their imagination: a murky puddle with a couple of plastic bottles floating on it, a  dead crow's wing. 'Ivy has started collecting things, such as feathers, stones and leaves. Albie has a fascination with dead things. 'Grown-ups can also forget that children's imaginations are not fired by the same things as theirs. We went for a walk in the Yorkshire Dales and at the top of a hill was a beautiful view. Where are the wild things? David charts his quest to get his children outside in new film Project Wild Thing . 'But Ivy and Albie were more interested in a snail colony under a rock and spent 45 minutes rearranging them.' In the film, David co-opts Ivy into being his Wild Time poster girl. She is pictured, a huge grin on her face, licking a frog. 'That's unhygienic!' protests one of the schoolgirls he shows it to. But David is unperturbed. He has naturalist and TV presenter Chris Packham on his side. Chris blames adults for the epidemic of squeamishness. 'It's adults who say “No” to children, who don't want them to pick up worms - or even to eat worms,' he says. (Evidently, Chris believes that eating worms is an entirely acceptable pastime.) 'I think we've become afraid of the outdoors,' says David. 'We now believe that there's a paedophile on every corner, when in fact 99.9 per cent of strangers are actually decent, kind people.' At times, David gets carried away on the flood tide of his enthusiasm. Kate reminds him that there are real hazards for children in the outside world. Traffic, for starters. That said, he believes a modicum of freedom, even for children as young as Ivy and Albie, is essential in building their confidence. Having fun together: David's app frees creativity, promotes concentration and, importantly, is great fun . His children may not actually volunteer to go outside without prompting, but these days they embrace the idea when David and Kate propose it. This development is gratifying for David's mother Helen, 81, who shares their home. 'She thought we'd lost our way a bit as parents and that we'd never see the light,' says David. 'When my sister and I were growing up we went outside a lot. 'So she's delighted her grandchildren are doing more outside. One weekend we all went blackberrying. Then we picked up the windfall apples in the garden and made a pie together. 'Nothing beats that kind of family time.' There will, I suspect, be parents who are loath to swap the freedom their children's screen time affords them; who do not relish exchanging a few hours of peace for a muddy tramp through autumnal leaves. Outdoors is, for many hard-pressed parents, messy, disordered and bothersome. David has some sympathy with this view. 'But what's a little mud in the great scheme of things? You have to be relaxed about it. It's OK to romp in a puddle. Our children's outdoor clothes are permanently caked in mud. Occasionally they get a good hosedown. 'An encounter with dirt and mud won't kill them. In fact, it boosts their immune systems. 'The app clears cluttered minds. It frees creativity. It promotes concentration. And it's really great fun.'

"By . Katy Winter . A woman has lost more than more than 6st through a strict diet and exercise regime after her boyfriend dumped her, telling her she was too overweight to find attractive. Shocked, Mona Christensen, a former investment risk advisor who once weighed nearly 18st and wore size 20 clothing, gave up her unhealthy habits and embarked on a new path which would lead her to becoming a professional personal trainer. Miss Christensen, 35, of Wells, has since found a new boyfriend and is now happy and healthy. Mona lost more than more than 6st (left before weight loss, right after) through exercise and dieting after her boyfriend dumped her by telling her she was too overweight to find attractive . Mona with her new boyfriend Gary Arnold, whom she met in August 2010 - their first date was a trip to Monkey World . She said: 'It's a very sensitive subject and I was shocked he said it. In retrospect, although it was a blow at the time, I'm grateful. My life has changed enormously since then and I'm satisfied with myself now.' Miss Christensen saw her weight pile on as she eased boredom in her day job by snacking on chocolate. She said: 'I also had undiagnosed celiac disease which caused my weight to fluctuate before and after I changed to a gluten-free diet. 'I was vegan for three years for ethical reasons, and that didn't help either, because all I ate were grain products.' Finally, in 2008, her boyfriend of seven years decided to break off their relationship. Mona dropped from 18st and a size 20 (left) to 11st and a size 10 (right) through diet and exercise . She said: 'He said he didn't find me attractive anymore, and it was a body weight issue. He'd obviously been thinking about it for a very long time. 'At the same time, I knew I wasn't small and had changed a lot since we met. I'm a loyal, committed person and it was a bit devastating.' Her 30th birthday, which she marked shortly afterwards, was spent alone, binging on chocolate and champagne as she tried to drown her sorrows. But then, around a year after the traumatic separation, Miss Christensen was inspired by her brother to begin a period of determined weightloss and fitness training. She said: 'I began eating six meals a day - a combination of proteins, carbohydrates and good healthy fats. Around a year after the traumatic separation, Miss Christensen was inspired by her brother to begin a period of determined weight loss and fitness training . 'I switched my diet to 100 per cent natural food, and banned processed foods from my meals entirely. 'I was careful to stabilise my blood sugar so the weight loss was sustainable. I wasn't interested in tricking my body into losing weight by starting a fad diet or joining a slimming club.' She also began exercising every other day, combining weight training with cardio routines, maximising her body's ability to convert fat to muscle. Losing weight at a steady rate of 2lb a month, in the course of two years she lost 5st. Today she weighs 11st and can fit into size 10 clothing. In August 2010, she met her current partner, Gary Arnold, 38, a client manager for database developer . Before beginning her weight loss journey, she typically did not eat breakfast, and ate a large pack of rice cakes with hummus for lunch. For dinner she would eat a large risotto, with crackers with guacamole for snacks. Today she has completely transformed her eating habits, eating six meals a day, typically a protein shake with fruit and various seed bars and portions of yogurt with honey or fruit. In August 2010, she met her current partner, Gary Arnold, 38, a client manager for database developer. She said: 'Gary was a needle in a haystack. For our first date we went to Monkey World. It was really lovely. He's very different to my ex-boyfriend but I'm very happy now.' Breakfast: Nothing . Lunch: Large pack of rice cakes and hummus . Dinner: Large risotto . Snacks: Crackers and guacamole . Then, in April 2013, she launched her own personal training business, named Functional Fitness Forever. She said: 'I knew this is what I wanted to do for a job. I absolutely love living a healthier life and I want to be able to share the things I've learned with others. I got a permanent studio in May this year and I've got a solid client base. 'I'm grateful to my ex-boyfriend for making that comment, even though I might have been upsetting at the time. 'If he hadn't told me, I might not have known that was the reason, and I might not have been set down the path I've been on. 'The only regret I have, looking back, is that he didn't tell me sooner.'

"By . Carol Driver . An airline which was named America’s most hated is offering 8,000 free air miles to passengers – who moan about it on social media. Ultra-low budget US carrier Spirit Airlines has launched a campaign called Hate Miles, where it rewards travellers who have had a bad experience on board one of its flights – or its competitors’. Whether it’s frustrations about carry-on luggage charges, expensive food costs or pre-assigned seating, Spirit is urging customers to vent their anger in 140 characters on Twitter. New campaign: Spirit's new website encourages passengers to moan about the airline online . In return, they’ll be handed 8,000 . free air miles – almost enough for a one-way trip with the airline, . which has received more complaints than any other domestic carrier for . five years in a row. As . ever, there’s a catch – with passengers needing 10,000 total miles to . secure a free flight, or flyers can sign up for the airline’s credit . card to be able to book 2,500-mile one-way fares. To . launch the campaign, Spirit, which has long come under fire from . disgruntled passengers over extra charges, has set up a website called . www.hatethousandmiles.com, which includes a humorous video about the . initiative. The site says: ‘Airlines mess up – but at least Spirit Airlines is willing to admit it. ‘We haven’t been great about telling you how we fly. We want to be better. ‘First, let’s clear the air. Hate on us – or any airline of your choosing – and we’ll send you 8,000 FREE SPIRIT miles. ‘You’ll be well on your way to earning an award flight with us. High complaints: Spirit topped the chart for grievances over the past five years . We . think that once you understand how we fly - how our total price is, on . average, 40%* lower than other airlines - you just might learn to love . us.’ In April, MailOnline . Travel reported every year from 2009-2013, passengers were three times . as likely to have an issue with Spirit than they were the second-place . airline. The figures were calculated based on complaints - from flights and fares, to baggage and refunds – per 100,000 passengers. Chart-topper: More complaints have been made about Spirit Airlines than any other carrier in the US . In . fact, Spirit received so many complaints, according to the the U.S. Public Interest Research Group Education Fund report, it had to be . excluded from deeper analysis of on-time performance, baggage . mishandling, and other issues. The airline also has its own ‘boycott Spirit’ Facebook page, and a Twitter handle called @hatespiritair. The . report, which analysed consumer complaints filed with the Department of . Transportation, said of Spirit: 'Two checked bags, basic meals and . snacks, carry-ons, and, often, in-flight entertainment were formerly . included in the price of your ticket, but now add-on fees for each of . these newly a la carte items can easily add $100 or more to the cost of a . one-way ticket.’ .","Hate Miles campaign launched in response to people moaning about airline .

"By . Carol Driver . A UK seaside town has banned MTV cameras from filming wild nights out there because it does not want to be portrayed as Britain's answer to Magaluf. Tourism bosses in Blackpool, Lancashire, revealed they have refused permission for TV show Geordie Shore to shoot footage there, as it does not want to be cast in a ‘detrimental light’. The reality show had planned to film in pubs, clubs and strip bars before returning to more late-night drinking at their hotel. Keep out! Blackpool has denied Geordie Shore camera crews from filming in the seaside town . Stars of the show: Vicky Pattison, left, and Charlotte Crosby both star in Geordie Shore . The programme was due to be shown on MTV in Geordie Shore's ninth series. However, the request comes after a video showing an 18-year-old girl carrying out a sex act on 24 men at a Carnage Magalluf party in Magaluf, Majorca, came to light. The footage has sparked outrage, with local mayor Manu Onieva voicing his ‘absolute indignation’ at the video, and at the claims that it was the result of an ‘everything-goes’ party culture. Party capital: Magaluf, popular for its cheap clubs and bars, has already been targeted for its drinking and clubbing culture (file picture) In the UK, . Blackpool tourism bosses said allowing Georgie Shore to film wild . nights out in the town would show the area in a 'less than savoury . light'. They issued a warning to club owners and the town's businesses to steer clear of the Geordie Shore cast as their 'less than savoury antics' were completely 'off message' for the resort. Councillour Graham Cain said: 'On a daily basis we receive requests from production companies to film in Blackpool. 'As . a town which relies on tourism we have to careful about allowing . programmes to be filmed which may show the resort in a detrimental . manner. 'We prefer to work with companies that appeal to our target market of families and do so on a regular basis. Scene: Party capital: The unnamed girl was captured on video working her way through men at Alex's Bar (pictured) in Magaluf. It was claimed her actions were the result of cheap alcohol and a party culture . 'All requests are carefully considered but on this occasion we chose to refuse Lime Pictures' application for permission.' Lime Pictures confirmed they made an enquiry to film in the resort but refused to comment on the refusal. Geordie Shore follows the trials and tribulations of a group of young men and women from Newcastle and the North East where the show is normally set. The last series raked in more than a million viewers on average per episode. The council’s decision to try to make Blackpool look squeaky clean follows its down market portrayal in Channel Four's 999 What's Your Emergency series. Hoteliers said it was hugely damaging for the town with people calling up to cancel bookings having watched the controversial show. Meanwhile, Geordie Shore's Jay Gardner has confirmed he also featured in the Magaluf sex act video as the girl asked him whether he wanted to be 'number 25'. The reality TV star can be seen at the end of the footage sticking his middle finger up at the blonde woman, who then walks away. Speaking to The Mirror, he said he been taking part in the bar crawl, but had decided not to take part in the sex game, calling it 'the most shocking thing I've seen.' 'The girl was being encouraged to drink more and more and was told she would win a ""holiday"" if she took part in this game'","Comes after sex act video at holidaymakers' party in Magaluf goes viral .

"By . Joshua Gardner . and Ap . and Reuters . A Missouri company has recalled potentially tainted beef products distributed to two restaurants and Whole Foods stores in Connecticut, the USDA has announced. Jackson-based Fruitland American Meat is recalling over 4,000 pounds of beef because it could contain parts of the nervous system that can carry properties related to bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease. BSE is fatal to cows and can cause a fatal human brain disease in people who eat tainted beef. The USDA said there's no indication the slaughtered cattle showed signs of BSE. Recall: A Missouri-based company has recalled over 4,000 pounds of beef over fears of mad cow disease . The department said the products were produced between September 2013 and April 2014 and were distributed to a restaurant in New York, New York, another in Kansas City, Missouri, and a Whole Foods distribution center in Connecticut. The USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service found the possible problem while reviewing the company's slaughter logs and said the issue may have been a result of the manner that company employees determined the age of various cattle. The dorsal root ganglia within the nervous system has to be removed from cattle that are 30 months and older but may have been present in some of the products. There have been no reports of adverse reactions to eating the products, the USDA said. The meat was sent to a Whole Foods distributor in Connecticut and two restaurants, one in New York City and the other in Kansas City, Missouri . The agency characterized the recall as a . Class II recall, meaning there's a 'remote probability' of health . problems associated with using the recalled product. Early this month, a Texas man died of the fatal brain illness variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, which is caused by meat from animals with BSE. The unnamed victim was the fourth person ever to die of the disease in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Human brain tissue as seen under the microscope. The darkened spot in the center is where prions, a sort of rogue protein believed to cause BSE, have concentrated . CJD is a . rare, degenerative, fatal brain disorder in humans, believed to be . caused by consumption of products from cows with bovine spongiform . encephalopathy (BSE), or 'mad cow' disease. Variant . CJD first emerged in the mid 1990s and is the human form of bovine . spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), commonly known as mad cow disease. The . disease, which affects the brain, is thought to have passed from cattle . to humans through infected food. It causes personality change, loss of . body function, and eventually death. World .

"By . Lillian Radulova . He started off as a tubby little ball boy, trailing around after his older brother, who learned to play with power so he wouldn't have to run. Now 19-year-old Nick Kyrgios, the newest darling of Australian tennis, is preparing to play the match of his life: a final 16 showdown with Spanish legend and world No 1 Rafael Nadal on the hallowed grass of Wimbledon. Kyrgios, just two weeks after being dubbed the 'next big thing' by Andy Murray, has stormed through the first three rounds at Wimbledon, stealing headlines after his giant-killing display against Richard Gasquet, in which he saved an incredible nine match points to shock the 13th seed. Scroll down for video . Nick Kyrgios has come a long way from his days as a ball boy for his older brother in Canberra. He will now face Spanish legend Rafael Nadal . Nick spent his early years acting as his older brother Christos' ball boy, with his mother Norlaila saying 'he was quite proud of himself, walking around collecting the balls' But at the Kyrgios family home in Canberra, his mother Norlaila waits for the rest of her family to let her know the results of each game, clutching at her Malaysian circular jade necklace- an exact replica of the one Nick wears- for good luck. The mother-of-three told the Daily Mail Australia that she gets far too nervous when watching him play at Wimbledon, instead preferring to reminisce of 'little Nick's' humble beginnings. 'He started playing tennis because my eldest son, Christos who is eight years older than him, was a tennis player - but not to Nick's level,' Norlaila said. 'He was Christos' ball boy – he would just follow him around and pick up his balls, and of course Christos had no mercy for his brother. Nick was a quite a chubby fellow at that age, and he was quite proud of himself, walking around collecting the balls. Nick (right) and his older brother Christos (left): The brothers are still close and have been keeping in touch while Nick is London via text message . Norlaila said her youngest son learnt his technique due to being 'too chubby' to run, opting instead to gain an advantage by hitting the ball outside of his opponent's reach to minimize how far he'd have to run himself . Next big thing: Nick Kyrgios celebrates victory in the third round of Wimbledon with his Aussie supporters in tow . 'But I felt sorry for him always following us around, so I asked him one day if he wanted to try. I gave him a try and, my god, he just whacked it! He really whacked it! And right over the net! The hand eye coordination was just… wow! So I kept feeding him balls. 'Just… wow! This tubby little thing and that arm strength – my goodness! It just started from there, but he didn't get a proper tennis lesson until he was about seven.' Currently ranked No 144 in the world, Kyrgios – who is of Malaysian and Greek decent - will enter the top 100 after fighting his way back from a set down to beat Czech Jiri Vesely 3-6, 6-3, 7-5, 6-2 on Saturday. Other tennis stars are also confident that he could make it to the top, including Andy Murray, ranked 5th in the world, who dubbed Nick the 'Next big Aussie star' in a recent tweet. Currently ranked No 144 in the world, Kyrgios (second from the right) - who is of Malaysian and Greek decent - will enter the top 100 after wining against Czech Jiri Vesely  on Saturday . Kyrgios began tennis lessons at seven years of age after his mum noticed how powerfully he would hit the ball . 'I gave him a try and, my god, he just whacked it!...This tubby little thing and that arm strength ¿ my goodness! It just started from there,' his mother told the Daily Mail Australia . But while the rest of the world ponders how the youngest man in the draw managed to rapidly make his way to the top after being ranked lower than 800th last year, Norlaila proves that mothers know best. 'He was still tubby [when he started his lessons] because he didn't like to run,' she laughed. 'I keep saying to people – the best thing about that period was that because he couldn't run to the ball, he would hit it super hard to a place so that the other guy couldn't hit it back to him. 'He wasn't eating the wrong things, he was just eating too much, I mean Malaysian and Greek food – who could refuse! So he was hitting so hard and accurate to the corners of the court because he couldn't run after it!' Talented from a young age: Nick won the former junior world championships as well as the Australian Open boys singles title in January 2013 . Nadal has admitted he is weary of his future opponent, saying 'He's a young player and young players are very dangerous' From the family album: Kyrgios (left) said he couldn't believe he would be facing Nadal in his fourth round at Wimbledon: 'I thought it would take years and years of work to finally have an opportunity like that' The teenager is currently preparing for his fourth-round clash, set against 14-times grand slam champion Nadal. Kyrgios has meanwhile expressed his enthusiasm for the latest challenge, even suggesting he's confident of a win. 'I'm overwhelmed with happiness. Making my fourth round at a grand slam and the opportunity to play Rafa, hopefully on Centre Court, it's an opportunity I'm just going to embrace,' he said. 'I never thought I would be seeing Nadal in my fourth round at Wimbledon in my 19th year. I thought it would take years and years of work to finally have an opportunity like that. 'Of course I have nothing to lose out there. Anything is possible.' Both of Nick's parents wear the same Malaysian circular jade necklace which their son wears to each of his games (pictured) for good luck . Gasquet congratulates Kyrgios after he beat him on Thursday . Up next: Kyrgios will face world No 1 Rafael Nadal in the next round . But it's not just about winning, according to his mother, who is proud to see how far her youngest child has come. 'At this stage I think it doesn’t matter if he wins or not because he got to Nadal on his own terms, not because it was a random draw pool – he got there himself,' she said. 'If he does win? That will just be ridiculous! I'll have to call him and say ""Your mama wants to live – your mama doesn't want to have a heart attack!""' 'I'm super proud! But, it's not just ""proud"", it's just being happy that it's jelling for him. He's thinking about the right things on court. He has lost the plot before many times because of one bad call and he'll be thinking about that and then lose the next two games when he should just move forward. 'I'm just super proud he’s thinking about the game and not rushing.' Humble beginnings: When asked how she would feel if ehr son won against Nadal, Noraila said 'That will just be ridiculous! I'll have to call him and say ""Your mama wants to live ¿ your mama doesn't want to have a heart attack!""' Raving: Andy Murray is one of the stars to tout Kyrgios as the next big thing . Family photo: From left to right, Nick's father George, his mother Norlaila, Nick, his brother Christos and his older sister Hali . Nonetheless, Norlaila guaranteed that she and Nick’s father George, who is at London by his son's side, will carry on wearing all their good luck charms until the end. Both of them wear the same necklace as Nick, a Malaysian circular jade, while his superstitious father ensures he wears the same shirt and the akubra hat he was wearing during his son's third win at every game. Leading up to their game on Monday, Nedal has admitted to being weary of his future opponent. 'He's a young player and young players are very dangerous as always the young players have something special. They are able to play with no pressure. They are fresh,' Nadal said of Kyrgios. 'He has a great serve. He's an aggressive player. I saw him few times but not 50 times like other players so I cannot talk too much.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Ap . Authorities say two F-16 fighter jets escorted a small airplane out of restricted airspace in Washington, an apparently inadvertent intrusion that prompted evacuations at the U.S. Capitol and surrounding buildings. The plane - a Mooney M20C personal aircraft - entered the restricted airspace about 1:30 p.m. and was 'out of communications with air traffic controllers,' the North American Aerospace Defense Command said in a statement. NAADC spokesman Master Sgt. Chuck Marsh says military jets escorted the plane to an airport in Mount Airy, North Carolina, where it landed Saturday afternoon. Evacuated: The U.S. Capitol, surrounding office buildings, the Supreme Court and the Library of Congress were evacuated Sunday . Secret Service agents met the plane there and interviewed the pilot, who was with one other passenger on his was to visit his daughter in North Carolina, the Boston Globe reports. According to the paper, the pilot was lost when he entered the restricted airspace surrounding D.C., and was likely due to the fact that he was outdated maps. Transportation Security Administration spokesman Ross Feinstein wrote on Twitter that it appeared the pilot was just confused. The plane had departed from Westfield, Massachusetts.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Ap . Former Dallas Cowboys tackle Josh Brent was released from jail on Sunday following his conviction for a drunken car crash that killed his friend and teammate, Jerry Brown, the Dallas County sheriff's office said. The 26-year-old Brent was convicted in January of intoxication manslaughter for the December 2012 crash that killed Jerry Brown, a Cowboys practice squad player. He was sentenced to 180 days in jail and 10 years' probation. It was not immediately clear whether he would be required to report to a rehab facility to complete his six-month sentence, which was expected to end in July. Sentenced: Former Dallas Cowboys player Josh Brent, pictured before his sentencing on Friday, must serve 180 days in prison for the fiery crash that killed his friend and fellow football player, Jerry Brown . Regret: Brent was convicted of killing his close friend in a 2012 car crash after drinking and driving . He could have been sentenced to up to 20 years in prison for the fiery December 2012 crash. At Brent's January sentencing hearing, state District Judge Robert Burns scolded Brent for his actions, the Dallas Morning News reported. 'You are not the first Dallas Cowboy to kill someone with a vehicle, but I hope you’re the last,' the judge said. Brent and Brown were college teammates at the University of Illinois and roommates in Texas, where Brown was a practice squad linebacker for the Cowboys. Brent was a defensive tackle for the Cowboys. He retired from the NFL months before his January trial, though he could attempt to be reinstated now that he has been released. It's unclear whether the NFL will suspend him before he can play again. The night of the wreck, the two men were headed home from partying with fellow Cowboys at a nightclub when Brent lost control of his Mercedes, causing a fiery accident. Officers who arrived on scene said Brent was seen trying to pull Brown's body from the wreckage. Police say Brent's blood-alcohol level was tested shortly after the crash at 0.18 percent, more than twice the legal limit for drivers in Texas. Guilty: 25-year-old Brent, left, was convicted of . intoxication manslaughter after the drunk-driving crash that killed his . friend and Dallas Cowboys teammate Jerry Brown, right, in December 2012 . Sadness: LaTasha Brent, Brent's mother, is helped from the court after her son's punishment was read . At trial, prosecutors argued that the . burly, 320-pound defensive tackle had as many as 17 drinks that night . of the crash and was driving around 110 miles per hour. One . prosecutor, Heath Harris, told jurors in closing arguments: 'This is . almost like a poster child case for intoxication manslaughter.' He and fellow prosecutor, Jason Hermus, had urged the jury to send a message about the seriousness of Brent's crime, saying drunk-driving put the public in danger. Brent's attorneys argued the blood tests . used by police were faulty and that Brent could not have drank nearly . that much. Attorney George Milner said his client was 'guilty of being . stupid behind the wheel of a car,' not drinking beforehand. Brent retired from the NFL last year, . but his ties to the Cowboys were prominent at trial. Loss: Stacey Jackson, Brown's mother, cried as she testified in the penalty phase of the trial Thursday . Hugs: Josh Brent gets a hug from family after closing arguments in his intoxication manslaughter trial Tuesday, January 21. On Wednesday, a jury convicted him of the charge . Two current . players, Barry Church and Danny McCray, testified about hanging out with . Brent and Brown, first playing video games, then having dinner and . going to Privae, a Dallas nightclub. Jurors . saw video of Brent appearing to hold bottles of Champagne in each hand . and credit-card receipts that showed Brent had purchased three bottles. They . also saw police dash cam footage of Brent losing his balance during . field sobriety tests and occasionally stumbling over his words while . talking to officers. Among those in the courtroom were Stacey Jackson, Brown's mother. Jackson has publicly forgiven Brent, according to KMSP- TV. Prosecutor Rebecca Dodds . had emphasized Brent's 2009 drunken driving arrest in Illinois to press . the state's argument that he deserved prison time. In that case, he served 30 days in jail after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor charge. Fatal: Josh Brent's Mercedes flipped over and landed on its roof in the December 2012 crash . 'Probation doesn't work for Josh Brent,' prosecutor Rebecca Dodds told the jury during closing statements in the punishment phase. The . sentencing comes just after weeks of fierce debate about a North Texas . teen, Ethan Couch, who received probation for intoxication manslaughter . after a wreck that left four people dead. Couch's case, and the so-called 'affluenza' defense his attorneys employed, became the subject of fierce, widespread scrutiny. Brent, a defensive tackle, had played in . all 12 games of the 2012 NFL season before the crash. He retired in . July. Brown was signed to the Cowboys' practice squad in the 2012 . season.","Brent was sentenced to 180 days in jail and 10 years probation and handed a $10,000 fine for the fiery 2012 crash that killed friend Jerry Brown .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Ap . An obsessed Los Angeles Dodgers fan was in jail in Cincinnati on Thursday, accused of trespassing and making threats at the Reds' ballpark he was banned from six years ago.

"By . Ap . and Joshua Gardner . California Chrome arrived in New York on Tuesday to begin preparations for his bid to become horse racing's first Triple Crown winner in 36 years. The Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner arrived at Belmont Park, where co-owner Steve Coburn says his 3-year-old underdog colt will have a guardian angel looking after him June 7. 'I honestly believe this horse is America's horse,' said the 61-year-old factory worker, who owns the year's breakout racing star along with a friend and their wives. Scroll down for video . Watched over: Co-owner Steven Coburn celebrates in the winner's circle after California Chrome won the 139th Preakness Saturday. He believes a guardian angel is helping usher the 3-year-old colt to a Triple Crown sweep . Humble horse: Triple Crown hopeful California Chrome pictured after he arrived at Belmont Park in Elmont, N.Y. The colt is the offspring of an $8,000 mare and a $2,500 stallion as bred by Coburn and his equally blue collar partner Perry Martin . Coburn told ABC that it may be his sister, who died from cancer at just 36, who's looking after the team of unlikely award-winning horse racers who've dubbed themselves the Dumb Ass Partners and adopted a donkey as a mascot. 'He was born on my sister Brenda’s birthday, Feb. 18,' Coburn said. 'I do believe this colt’s got a guardian angel with him all the time. I say a prayer before every race, and between her and him, everything’s coming true.' But with or without divine intervention, Coburn says his everyman horse will win thanks to his old fashioned American work ethic. 'He loves people, he loves what he does and that's why he's America's horse,' he told USA Today. 'What he's doing for two guys that work their butts off every day just to put beans and bacon on the table, this horse has given everybody else out there the incentive to say, ""You know what? We can do it, too.""' California Chrome was backed off the van - he doesn't like walking straight off like most horses - and then led into the Belmont's barn by assistant trainer Alan Sherman. 'We just hope this horse is letting America know that the little guy can win,' Coburn said. 'I honestly believe this horse is America's horse.' Fast learner: California Chrome strikes a stately pose as he becomes accustomed to the new surroundings at Belmont Park in Long Island, N.Y. At left, the horse's gleeful assistant trainer describes the shock of becoming a champion horse trainer almost overnight . California Chrome walked several laps around the barn before being taken outside to pose on the grass for a media horde. He later settled into his stall. 'He likes to stand out here and pose,' Sherman said. 'He loves to get his picture taken. He's a very inquisitive horse. He's always checking out what's going on around him. He's actually been so straightforward to train; he's made our jobs easy.' California Chrome will start training on the track daily beginning Wednesday. The 3-year-old colt is set to run in the Belmont Stakes on June 7. He owns a six-race winning streak, including the Derby by 1 3/4 lengths and the Preakness by 1 1/2 lengths. No horse has swept the Derby, Preakness and Belmont since Affirmed in 1978. 'I think the industry could really use a Triple Crown winner right now, especially with a story like this,' Sherman said. 'This horse didn't cost a ton of money to buy him or breed him. This goes to show you never know what can happen in this game.' Unlikely: California Chrome, ridden by jockey Victor Espinoza, wins the 139th Preakness Stakes horse race at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore. If he wins at Belmont, he'll become the first Triple Crown winner since 1978 after already staking claim to one of the sport's greatest rags-to-riches stories . Sherman assists his 77-year-old father, Art, who returned to Southern California after the Preakness. The elder Sherman plans to reunite with his horse and son the week before the Belmont. 'I'm so proud of my dad for him to be able to do this towards the end of his career,' Alan Sherman said. 'He's very deserving.' Preakness runner-up Ride On Curlin accompanied California Chrome on the trip from Baltimore. Another Preakness starter under consideration for the Belmont is third-place finisher Social Inclusion, who is scheduled to arrive in New York on Friday. General A Rod (fourth), Ring Weekend (fifth) and Kid Cruz (eighth) are questionable to run in the 1 1/2-mile race. Other probables are Commanding Curve, Danza, Wicked Strong, and Samraat, the second, third, fourth and fifth-place finishers from the Derby; along with Tonalist and Commissioner, who were first and second in the Peter Pan at Belmont; and Intense Holiday, 12th in the Derby. 'It looks like it could be a tough one,' said Todd Pletcher, who trains Danza, Commissioner and Intense Holiday.","The Kentucky Derby and Preakness-winning horse will compete to become the first to also sweep New York's Belmont Stakes since 1978 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Ap . RadioShack's first-quarter loss widened and revenue slumped as the retailer dealt with weakness in its mobile business and consumer electronics. Its performance missed Wall Street's view. The stock dropped more than 11 percent in afternoon trading on Tuesday. CEO Joseph C. Magnacca said in a statement that its mobile business was hurt because the current handset assortment didn't resonate well with customers. Tough year: Radio Shack stock continues to fall, including an 11 percent drop Tuesday afternoon alone . It was also contending with more promotions, including those of wireless carriers. Magnacca said that RadioShack is working on building its pipeline of new products, including private brand and exclusive items such as those from new partnerships with Quirky and PCH. The company is trying to update its image and compete with the rise of online and discount retailers. Long known as a destination for batteries and obscure electronic parts, RadioShack has sought to remake itself as a specialist in wireless devices and accessories. But growth in the wireless business is slowing, as more people have smartphones and see fewer reasons to upgrade. CEO: Radio Shack boss Joe Magnacca blames falling stock prices on a weakness in its mobile business . Part of its turnaround effort has included cutting costs, renovating stores and shuffling management. It also announced in March that it planned to close up to 1,100 of its stores in the U.S., leaving it with more than 4,000 U.S. locations. For the period ended May 3, RadioShack Corp. lost $98.3 million, or 97 cents per share. That compares with a loss of $28 million, or 28 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding certain items, its loss from continuing operations was 98 cents per share. Analysts, on average, expected a loss of 52 cents per share, according to a FactSet poll. Best Buy stock prices are also falling, with shares dropping 26 percent since this time last year . Revenue for the Fort Worth, Texas-based company declined 13 percent to $736.7 million from $848.4 million. Wall Street was calling for $767.5 million. Sales at stores open at least a year, a key gauge of a retailer's health, fell 14 percent on softer traffic and weakness in the mobile business. This metric excludes results from stores recently opened or closed. Shares of RadioShack fell 18 cents to $1.36 in afternoon trading. Its shares have dropped almost 61 percent over the past year. Radio Shack isn't the only electronics store to have a rough year -- according to CNN, Best Buy shares are down 26 percent from this time last year.","Radio Shack stock prices dropped 11 percent on Tuesday afternoon .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Ap . A Michigan teenager . who wanted to raise awareness about cerebral palsy by walking 40 miles . with his younger brother strapped to his back battled heat, rain, . fatigue and more to finish the trek Sunday. Hunter . Gandee, 14, had been planning for weeks to pull off the walk, hoping to . put a face on the muscular disorder that prevents his 7-year-old . sibling, Braden, from being able to walk without help. But all his . organizing couldn't prepare him for the conditions he faced as he packed . the 50-pound boy over two days. He even thought about giving up along the way. Scroll down for video . Incredible: 14-year-old Hunter Gandee walked 40 miles with his 7-year-old brother Braden Gandees on his back . Swagger: The walk was called the 'Cerebral Palsy Swagger' to raise awareness about the disease that affects Braden . 'Honestly, . yes, there was a point that we did consider stopping,' Hunter said. 'Braden's legs - the chafing was getting pretty bad. We did have to . consider stopping. It was at about the 30-mile point.' A phone call changed all that. Hunter . reached out to a friend, who said a prayer for the brothers. That, . combined with some rest and a change in how Braden was positioned on his . brother's back, helped the boys make it the final 10 miles. It . may have taken a bit longer than they anticipated, but the Gandees and . more than a dozen of their family members and friends strolled up a . winding road Sunday toward the University of Michigan's wrestling . center. At the top of the hill, Hunter lifted . up Braden so he could touch a 'Go Blue' banner erected for them near the . walk's endpoint. The move was met with thunderous applause and cheers . from those who had gathered to see the boys finish the trek. Tough: The boy's almost had to stop because of chafing on Braden's legs caused by the way he was situated on his brother's back, but the tough 7-year-old powered through it . Asked how he felt, Braden replied simply: 'Tired.' Hunter said he was 'more tired than I think I've ever been. My legs are pretty sore. But we pushed through it. And we're here.' More . than 30 hours earlier, Hunter, with Braden securely strapped to his . back, left the parking lot of Bedford Junior High in Temperance near the . Ohio border. Just before their Saturday morning departure, well-wishers . packed the gym for a send-off and the school band performed. The boys' parents and two other siblings accompanied them on the walk. A caravan of cars and other walkers also joined in. The . goal of the walk, called the Cerebral Palsy Swagger, was to raise . awareness about cerebral palsy and hopefully inspire new ideas for . mobility aides and medical procedures. Braden typically uses a walker, braces or a power chair to get around. Touching: Hunter says he walked so far with his brother on his back to show Braden how much he appreciated him being there for him . Finished! After a grueling 40 miles on his brother's back, Braden celebrates with friends and family . Hunter, . a 155-pound wrestler, said he trained for the trek by lifting weights . and staying active. And by checking the weather forecast. Saturday was warm and sunny, but Sunday was cool and rainy. The boys were prepared, though, and packed a variety of outerwear. By . the time Sunday afternoon arrived, the rain had subsided and they . completed their triumphant march into Ann Arbor under sunny skies. For Hunter, the walk was about doing something for his brother. 'I . can't even describe to you how special (Braden) is to me. I can't put . it into words,' the teen said. 'He's awesome. He's always there for me. I . really just wanted to give back to him in some way.'","Hunter Gandee walked 40 miles with his brother Braden strapped to his back .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Ap . A state appellate court in New Jersey has ruled that a mother's rights were not violated by a judge's decision that barred her from ranting about her children and ex-husband on Facebook. The judge's 2011 order was a special condition of the woman's probation stemming from an attempt to kidnap her two children and take them to Canada. The restriction came after the woman's ex-husband's family and Hunterdon County prosecutors argued that her Facebook postings were frightening, saying they referenced the Book of Revelation, serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer, Satan and Adolf Hitler. Ban: A judge ruled that a previous order banning a woman from posting certain things on Facebook was not unconstitutional . 'You can talk about what you want to talk about, but don't reference (your husband) or the children,' the judge told her, Mycentraljersey.com reports. 'That's off limits.' But in 2012, the mother returned to Facebook and began using a code word, 'Camelot,' to refer to her family. The judge found that the posting violated her probation. She appealed, claiming the order violated her rights of free speech and due process because it was too vague. Cannibal: The unidentified mother posted 'frightening' messages on Facebook about serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer . The appellate panel disagreed, finding the order was specific and didn't prevent her from making posts about other issues. The court said the special condition was imposed with the purpose of advancing her rehabilitation. The woman, who has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, was arrested in May 2011 after she tried to take her children to Canada in violation of a custody order. Mein Fuhrer: In addition to 'frightening' posts about Dahmer and the Book of Revelation, she also wrote about Hitler . She eventually pleaded guilty to interference with custody, and prosecutors dropped the kidnapping charge. The woman wasn't identified in court documents in order to protect the identities of her family members.","In 2011, a judge banned the unidentified woman from ranting about her children and ex-husband on Facebook .

"By . Ap . and Daily Mail Reporter . California Chrome repelled one challenger and then put away another in the stretch to win the Preakness on Saturday, setting up a Triple Crown try in three weeks. The chestnut colt with the four white feet will attempt to sweep the Kentucky Derby, Preakness and Belmont Stakes, something that hasn't been done since Affirmed in 1978. Since then, 12 horses have won the first two legs and failed to complete the sweep; the last was I'll Have Another two years ago. Winner: California Chrome won the Preakness Stakes on Saturday, giving the 3-year-old a shot at being the first horse to win the Triple Crown since 1978 . Belmont: Jockey Victor Espinoza celebrates after getting one step closer to the Triple Crown, which could be won at the Belmont Stakes next month . Maybe the horse with the modest pedigree and average Joe owners is the one. California Chrome defeated Ride On Curlin by 1 1/2 lengths at Pimlico, covering 1 3/16 miles in 1:54.84.

Ride On Curlin, next-to-last in the 10-horse field, ranged up and briefly appeared ready to overtake California Chrome. Once again showing his class, California Chrome denied the threat. 'It's an awesome feeling,' Espinoza said. 'Today it was just a crazy race. I got more tired mentally than physically. I see another horse go to the front. I was going to sit second. .. I sit back, as soon as the other horse got clear of me, it worked out perfect.' The Win: California Chrome (right) will face a longer race track next month at Belmont .
