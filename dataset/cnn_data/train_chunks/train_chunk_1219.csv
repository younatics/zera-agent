"This is the moment an Afghan police officer dramatically apprehended a man suspected of throwing a grenade in the diplomatic quarter of Kabul this morning. The blast shook houses in the Wazir Akbar Khan area of the city, which is home to embassies, international media offices and aid groups, but there were no casualties, police said. Minutes after the grenade attack, plain clothed officers from the Afghan special forces raced to a small hillside on the outskirts of Wazir Akbar Khan, where they were able to arrest a suspect - leading him away from the scene with a shawl wrapped around his head. Held: A plain clothes Afghan police officer dramatically apprehends a man suspected of throwing a grenade in the diplomatic quarter of Kabul . Restrained: The Afghan police officer pins to the terror suspect to the floor as he waits for back-up to arrive in Kabul's diplomatic quarter . Captured: Armed Afghan police officers wearing their distinctive blue uniforms arrive at the scene and the man is formally arrested . 'Someone threw a hand grenade and he was apprehended,' said Sediq Sediqqi, a spokesman for the interior ministry. The suspect was being interrogated but his motive and target were still unclear, he added. Earlier today, a remote-controlled bomb exploded on the outskirts of Kabul as a bus carrying Afghan army personnel passed by, said Zahir Azimi, a spokesman for the Afghan defence ministry. Seven of the bus passengers were injured. In an email to journalists, the Taliban insurgency claimed responsibility for that attack. Kabul has suffered a growing number of bombings by the Taliban and other jihadist militants as foreign combat troops withdraw from a 13-year-long war, leaving behind a smaller support mission. Yesterday a magnetic bomb killed two U.S. troops in the capital. Hidden: Police officers carry the suspect awat from the scene of the grenade attack with a black shawl wrapped around his head . Led away: 'Someone threw a hand grenade and he was apprehended,' said Sediq Sediqqi, a spokesman for the interior ministry. The suspect was being interrogated but his motive and target were still unclear, he added . This morning it was claimed that the United States is preparing to increase the number of troops it keeps in Afghanistan in 2015 to fill a gap left in the NATO mission by other contributing nations, according to three sources with direct knowledge of the situation. The final numbers are still being agreed, but there will be at least several hundred more than initially planned, one of the sources said. 'If they hadn't done that, the mission would have lost bases,' the source said. Under the U.S. commitment, described as a 'bridging solution' until other nations fulfil their pledges later in the year or the troops are no longer needed, Washington may provide up to 1,000 extra troops. That figure was confirmed by all three sources, who said the final number was still under discussion and depended on when other countries stepped forward with their commitments. An Afghan police officer stands guard at the blast site after a grenade attack rocked the capital Kabul this morning but caused no casualties . Hunt: Afghan investigators search the blast site for evidence and to ensure the suspect hadn't left a hidden bombs in the area . The additional U.S. troops will be assigned to a 12,000-strong NATO force staying in Afghanistan to train, advise and assist Afghan forces through a new mission called Resolute Support, said the sources, who declined to be indentified. The bulk of Western combat troops are to leave the country at the end of this year when the mission officially winds up after 13 years of war against a stubborn Taliban and its al Qaeda allies. President Barack Obama had announced in May that U.S. troop levels would be cut to 9,800 by the end of the year, by half again in 2015 and to a normal embassy presence with a security assistance office in Kabul by the end of 2016. 'There will be 9,800 troops, plus at least a few hundred above and beyond that,' the same source said. Of the 9,800, some 8,000 had been earmarked for the NATO force and the remainder for a separate anti-terrorism operation. The move to increase the U.S. presence left in Afghanistan comes shortly after Obama approved plans to give the U.S. military a wider role to fight the hardline Islamist Taliban movement alongside Afghan forces after the mission expires.","Grenade blast shook houses in the Wazir Akbar Khan area of Kabul - home to embassies and media centres .

"The daily lives of medieval townsfolk have been brought to light by an extraordinary haul of graffiti found in Norwich Cathedral. Messages have been scratched into the walls of the historic buildings over hundreds of years, but few people have ever stopped to work out what they say. Archaeologists have now started a major project to decipher the extraordinary messages, and have found a mixture of musical pieces, pious exhortations and even supernatural curses. Music: These lines of notes (which have been digitally overlayed for the sake of clarity) were scratched into the walls of Norwich Cathedral in the medieval period . Ship: This inscription shows a boat about to be swallowed by a giant whale, seen in the bottom right . While most church-goers these days would never even contemplate defacing the walls of a Norman cathedral with graffiti, medieval residents of Norfolk had a far less protective attitude to their monuments. Volunteers from the Norfolk Medieval Graffiti Survey began cataloguing the scrawls found in the cathedral earlier this year, and have already recorded hundreds of inscriptions. 'The walls are covered in everything you can think of,' project director Matthew Champion said. 'Medieval ships, names, animals, windmills, figures and prayers. 'Just about everything that would have been important to the citizens of Norwich during the Middle Ages. Curse? The name 'Kaynfford' was carved upside down, implying links to black magic . Pious: A human figure, thought to be a saint, can just about be deciphered in this photograph . Superstition: This 'petal' design was probably used to bring good luck or ward off evil spirits . 'I think we have to understand that our modern view of the cathedral is very different from the way in which it was viewed by the local people during the Middle Ages, particularly the ways in which it was used. 'They saw nothing wrong with carving their prayers into the very stones of the building.' His deputy Colin Howey added: 'These are whispers in stone and you are standing in the place where, hundreds of years ago, someone would have been scratching away. 'It could be a devout symbol of faith, or someone creating a slander, or a musician noting down a new composition. 'There are a whole range of motivations - and exactly what they could have been, who knows? But it is tantalising.' Staves: The cathedral's organist is hoping to play the pieces scratched into the walls of the building . Extraordinary: The etchings have been in place for hundreds of years but were never deciphered until now . In the cathedral's nave, a clear outline of a ship had been recorded earlier - possibly a prayer left for a fisherman or mariner. But until last week, no one had spotted that the ship was being pursued by an enormous open-mouthed whale. 'We think it could have been a prayer made by someone related to a sailor, and the whale is most likely Jonah's whale,' Mr Howey said. On another pillar are two four-line musical staves, overlaid with a series of notes, thought to have been inscribed in the second half of the 16th century, before the introduction of the five-line staves used today. 'We are talking to the cathedral organist and he is having a look to see if he could play it,' Mr Howey said. 'Here we have a piece of music from 400 years ago being lifted off the walls - indeed it could have been the organist at the time who scratched this composition onto a wall in order to play it later.' Project: Colin Howey, from the Norfolk Medieval Graffiti Survey, taking a record of the ship inscription . Iconic: Norwich Cathedral has been a centre of worship since it was built during the Norman period . A more sinister group of inscriptions consist of beautifully carved text which was written upside down, suggesting they may have had a magical import such as being used as curses. 'We know that from ancient times through to the medieval, inverting things was to wish bad upon them,' Mr Howey said. 'It is exactly the kind of folk magic that the church frowned upon in the extreme.' One inscription, showing the figure of a man, has been interpreted as a drawing of a saint, which would be a unique discovery among English carvings. The graffiti was presumably intended to smooth a worshipper's path to Heaven - and could even have been scratched into the wall by a Roman Catholic secretly expressing his forbidden beliefs. Petal-shaped designs seem to have been carved deep into the stone by masons working on the construction of the building, and have been described as 'devotional gestures' or symbols to 'ward off bad spirits'. The graffiti initiative, which has gained the approval of the cathedral's Dean and Chapter, will continue throughout the spring and early summer. Construction on Norwich Cathedral began in 1096, during the reign of William II. While it has undergone repeated renovations over the years, what remains of the church mainly dates back to the 17th century, when it was rebuilt after being ransacked by Puritans.",Major project at Norwich Cathedral aims to catalogue inscriptions .
"Alyssa Riggan hasn't dwelled on being the first person in the U.S. to successfully receive part of a liver from a living donor 25 years ago, a medical procedure that paved the way for routine live-donor transplants. The anniversary falls on Thanksgiving this year. Riggan was 21 months old when her mother, Teri Smith, donated more than a third of her liver to save her daughter from a disorder called biliary atresia. Its success has enabled her to live a normal life, almost completely untouched by what was an often-fatal disorder. Milestone: Alyssa Riggan, who was the first in the United States to successfully receive a liver from a living donor 25 years ago, poses with her husband, Benjamin, in their home in Severn, Maryland . 'Most of the time, I didn't think about it,' Riggan, 26, said in an interview this week at her home in Severn, Maryland, noting her good health has enabled her to enjoy ballet and tap dancing since age five. 'All of my anniversaries are really big, so that's when you really think about it the most.' The procedure expanded the options for children with liver disorders, many of whom died while waiting for a liver from a deceased donor. It was first used only in small children. It's now used for older children, and at some transplant centers, for adults. Biliary atresia is a disease that blocks liver bile ducts, backing up bile in the bloodstream and the liver. Before Riggan's operation, liver transplants from living donors had been performed only four times - in Brazil, Australia and Japan. Those surgeries involved desperately ill children. Riggan's transplant was the first on a child with time to wait. An adult liver grows back to normal after the operation. The segment transplanted grows within the recipient. The University of Chicago team that performed the surgery on Riggan was led by Dr. Christoph Broelsch. The youngest member was Dr. Dick Thistlethwaite, then 41. 'I can tell you we were all extremely concerned about the safety of the mother, Teri, who was just a trouper throughout,' Thistlethwaite said. 'We were really thankful she got through the operation safely. The feeling when Alyssa's operation was finished was one of elation that it appeared to be a success. 'It was a feeling we had really done something worthwhile that would help, not just this patient, but others as well.' Using parents as living donors posed complex ethical questions. With a parent willing to risk anything to help her child, how could the doctors be sure they were upholding the ethical standard of informed consent? Before the first surgery, the University of Chicago team published a paper in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine on how they intended to answer ethical questions as they selected patients and donors. They wouldn't use the living donor procedures in emergencies to reduce the time pressure on a donor's decision. A two-week cooling-off period would give the donor time to reflect and possibly back out. And a liver specialist would act as the donor's advocate throughout the process, assigned to champion the donor's health and safety. The landmark paper helped shape ethical standards still used today. Dr. Mark Siegler, director of the MacLean Center for Clinical Medical Ethics at the University of Chicago, said publishing the paper before the first surgery helped the team gather professional and public comment and criticism - essentially what is now called 'crowdsourcing.' That in itself is regarded as 'an ethical breakthrough in ways to approach and improve surgical innovation,' said Siegler, who co-authored the paper. For Smith, who was 29 during the transplant, Thanksgiving will be a time to reflect with gratitude. 'I guess the biggest thing is that our goal was for her to have a normal healthy life: to be able to graduate from high school, graduate from college, get married,' Smith said. 'So, as she's achieved all of those, each one is a memory and a reminder of it, but that the ultimate goal was achieved long before that: her just having a normal life where it wasn't a constant reminder.'","Alyssa Riggan, 26, was the first person in the U.S. to successfully receive part of a liver from a living donor 25 years ago .

"When cartoonist Clive Collins proudly posed before cameras with his MBE he revealed his rock star brother Phil had stepped in to join him because his son couldn’t make it. Clive’s son – also called Phil – was sailing the Atlantic on a ‘once in a lifetime’ voyage to the Caribbean and beyond. Collins junior blogged from the island of Aruba that he was ‘so, so proud’ of his father and told him and his multi-millionaire uncle Phil to have an ‘amazing day at Buckingham Palace’. Scroll down for video... Two years ago Phil Collins' nephew Philip Austin Collins, 39, (above) was arrested in Peru after £3million-worth of cocaine was found on a yacht he and two other British men were trying to sail across the Atlantic . Humiliating: Philip Austin Collins was paraded in front of Peruvian media following his arrest . Nervous: Philip Collins bites his nails as he is taken away by Peruvian police following his arrest . Weeks later in Lima – the capital of Peru – the 37-year-old sailor and his two crew mates Gareth Young, 39, and Richard Crewe, 32, would also find themselves paraded before the cameras. But they were in handcuffs after being arrested for allegedly trying to smuggle £3million of cocaine out of Peru and on to the streets of Britain. They face up to 15 years in a rat infested jail after 30kilos of the Class A drug was allegedly hidden in the fuel tanks and fire extinguishers of their yacht, the Audaciter. The trio are among 27 suspects, including three Italians and a Peruvian woman called Helena Ramirez Vargas, arrested in police operations in Peru in the last month that have seen more than a ton of drugs seized. The Italian men were arrested in possession of cocaine and ecstasy and are believed to belong to a gang called the Bambinos. Raid: The moment Peruvian police boarded the Audaciter boat to search for drugs . Allegations: Officers swooped on the 37-year-old former pub owner, whose father Clive is musician Phil's brother, while he was onboard his 39ft boat the Audaciter . Claims: The cocaine was reportedly hidden in fire extinguishers and gas cylinders in the cabin . Collins’ father Clive, 71, who was honoured for his services to art in January, must now endure an agonising wait to learn the fate of his son because of Peru’s notoriously slow legal system. Speaking from their £500,000 home in Benfleet, Essex, Collins’ stepmother Lynne, 58, said: ‘This is a very, very distressing time.’ It is a far cry from the excitement of six months ago when Collins and his crewmates set off from Mylor Marina in Cornwall in their 28-year-old Tradewind 39 cruiser. The former pub manager and his friend Gareth Young, a pharmacist, had bought the yacht for £65,000 in 2010 telling the broker they were planning on taking a gap year to the Galapagos Islands. The pair had been friends since attending the elite Westcliff High School for Boys, a well-respected grammar school in Essex. Proud: Clive Collins (right) with brother Phil (left) as he received his MBE for services to art earlier this year. Clive's son Phil called to say he would not be able to attend . Greg Duffy, the previous owner of the Audaciter, said: ‘They said they had taken an intensive zero to hero course teaching them to sail and they were planning a trip to the Galapagos Islands. It is the perfect yacht for that.’ They made an attempt to sail to the Caribbean soon after buying the yacht but had to be rescued by the RNLI just south of Cornwall, after one of its masts broke. Undeterred they waited a year before setting off again in September, even pressing on after their engine failed hours into the voyage. Collins kept a blog detailing their journey which included stop offs in La Coruna in Spain, where they got their engine fixed, the Canary Islands and Cape Verde off the coast of Senegal. They then sailed to Antigua where they spent Christmas with their girlfriends who had flown out to meet them. After leaving the island the three friends island hopped to Montserrat, Guadeloupe, Dominica and St Lucia before arriving at Aruba off the coast of Venezuela on January 23, 2012. It is from there on January 26 that Collins writes of his regret at missing his father being awarded the MBE. He blogs: ‘Originally I thought I was going to be able to attend. The reality with this unpredictable sailing lark is that it was unfeasible which upset me greatly.’ Discovery: This police video shows the cocaine was allegedly hidden in fire extinguishers . From this point the blog takes a darker tone as Collins writes about his friends falling out after a night in a casino. Then, after paying $1,000 to get through the Panama Canal, he writes about befriending a ‘crazy Ecuadorian’ who claims his nephew is the vice president of Ecuador. This man apparently directs them to Manta in Ecuador telling them to mention his name to a man called Roduigo Adugo and ‘he will sort everything out for you’. When they arrived in Manta on February 20 and eventually find Mr Adugo it appears he owns the yacht club ‘and about 20 of the huge fishing boats out in the harbour’ and arranges for his engineers to make repairs to the Audaciter. Collins and the crew eventually left Manta on March 1, heading south down the coast of Ecuador to test their new engine before heading out into the Pacific to the Galapagos Islands. By now Collins appears tired of his travels and reveals he is planning to fly home when the yacht returns to the Panama Canal after the Galapagos. Seized: Collins was later humiliatingly paraded in front of Pervuian television cameras. Next to him were bags full of cocaine found in several recent raids . In his last blog entry on March 4 he says: ‘We have been away for nearly five months but only recently has it started to take its toll.’ But eight days later the three were arrested after their boat was intercepted leaving the Yacht Club de la Punta Callao in Lima, more than 1,000 miles away from the Galapagos. National Police director Raul Salazar said the arrests showed his officers were effectively disrupting the ‘international tentacles’ involved in the country’s illegal drug trade. The three Britons were paraded in front of cameras with their hands cuffed behind their back next to bags full of cocaine from recent raids. Last night Richard Crewe’s mother Brigitta, looked distressed as she answered the door at her home near Norwich. She said: ‘I haven’t spoken to him. I can’t say anything at the moment.’ A friend of Collins said:  ‘Everyone is putting their faith in the Foreign Office that they can sort the situation out.’ Peruvian police allegedly found 30kilos of cocaine on the Audaciter. Cocaine has a street value of around £50 a gram meaning the haul could be worth £1.5million. However the drug is likely to be pure because it has come direct from South America meaning it could be cut doubling its street value to £3million. The Foreign Office said it was providing consular assistance.","Philip Austin Collins detained alongside two other Britons over 30kg bust .

"Two 'greedy' Royal Bank of Scotland bankers who masterminded a £3million property fraud were spared jail after a judge decided they had already 'suffered' enough. Andrew Ratnage, 50, and his boss Raymond Pask, 54, were both earning more than £100,000-a- year but wanted to make more money using a mortgage scam. Together they set up a series of fake companies in the name of Pask's family and then made applications for loans to 'tart' up  homes and  sell them at a profit. The bankers, who were based at NatWest's office in Romford, Essex, a bank owned by RBS, then fraudulently borrowed just under £3million over five years. Walking free: Andrew Ratnage, 50, and his boss Raymond Pask, 54, ran a five-year £3million mortgage scam but were given suspended sentences because they had 'suffered' enough . The scam also boosted their bonuses to more than £50,000-a-year - on one occasion taking it to £78,000 for Ratnage. The mortgage applications were submitted to their own bank without the pair ever revealing who was behind them and they also decided to forge documents to inflate the value of homes. Once their own bank, which is majority-owned by the taxpayer, lent them the cash they were able to buy two properties in fashionable Stoke Newington in north-east London and another yards from the sea in Whitstable, Kent. Two more were also bought in east London and Essex. At one stage Pask was living in a house worth more than £1million and sitting on a £1.2million pension pot. He took £136,000 from one of the development companies alone and drove a top of the range BMW, the Old Bailey heard. But because all the loans have been repaid Judge Rebecca Poulet QC gave them suspended prison sentences not time in jail, saying they had already 'suffered' and were 'embarrassed'. She said: 'I accept that it was not your intention to case loss to the bank. I accept you intended at all times for the money to be repaid and it has been fortunate the bank has not suffered. 'I have no doubt that both of you have suffered in the time it has taken this case to come to court.' Scam: The bankers borrowed the money to 'tart' up properties like one in this Stoke Newington street so they could sell them on for profit . Portfolio: They also bought a property in this road in fashionable Whitstable in Kent, which is a street away from the seafront . Pask's marriage has collapsed, he has lost his home and his pension pot has been reduced to £120,000, the court heard. He claims he is 'financially ruined.' Ratnage suffers from heart problems, high blood pressure and such severe diabetes that it was thought his foot might have to be amputated. The pair were working at the NatWest office in Romford, which at that time owned RBS. The two bankers at the centre of the mortgage fraud took large sums of the cash at the height of the financial crisis. Since 2008 mortgage applications have been much more stringent. Before that period Royal Bank of Scotland was one of the largest and most aggressive banks in the world. The bank was founded in Edinburgh in 1727, but by the end of the 20th century it was a major player in the City of London too as the UK capital became the world's leading financial centre. RBS sealed its place at the top table of British banking in 2000 when it bought NatWest, which dates back to 1650 and was considered one of the 'Big Four' retail banks in the UK. Fred Goodwin, right, became chief executive of RBS the following year and pioneered a gung-ho expansion strategy with resources poured into its investment banking division. One of the biggest deals came when RBS joined a consortium to buy Dutch bank ABN Amro for £49billion, which was later revealed as a major overvaluation. With the advent of the 2007 credit crunch and subsequent global financial turmoil, RBS was exposed as being dangerously indebted and unable to meet its obligations. The Labour Government felt it had no option but to step in, and in October 2008 it took a 57 per cent stake in the bank in return for £37billion of new capital. As the bank's losses spiralled and it required even more bail-out money, the state share of the firm rose to 82 per cent. Much of the blame for RBS's troubles was attributed to Goodwin, who was forced to resign and subsequently stripped of the knighthood he had received in 2004. They planned to take advantage of the booming property market to pay back the loans and cash on the profits. Bosses at RBS discovered the fraud in October 2010 after Ratnage, then a relationship manager, took long-term sick leave and other people took over his work portfolio. The investigation then discovered that the companies used to make the loan applications were linked to Pask, the 'regional director for relationship management.' Pask resigned from RBS after 33 years service in December 2010 but it was not until last year that the two men were charged by City of London Police. In interview Ratnage complained to officers that he was poorly trained and 'under a huge amount of pressure at work'. The scam involved sending through loan applications to the RBS credit department without disclosing that they were the beneficiaries. Pask and Ratnage concealed their identities using companies registered in the names of relatives of Pask. Ratnage also used forged documents to inflate valuations for homes. During this time Ratnage received bonuses ranging from £48,000 in 2006 to £78,000 in 2008. Pask also received annual bonuses of around £50,000 between 2006 and 2008. 'You were in effect greedy,' said Judge Poulet, adding: 'You were acting in a breach of trust. It was sophisticated and sustained and to an extent involved others - the nominees of the companies. 'The public must be discomforted by hearing the details of your criminal conduct. But it did not involve loss to your employers and the actual risk was at least limited. 'You have expressed shame and embarrassment at what you have done - as well you might.' The judge gave Ratnage a 20 month sentence suspended for two years and ordered him to do 300 hours of work in the community. Pask was given an 18 month sentence suspended for two years and ordered to do 250 hours. Ratnage is unemployed but Pask has a job advising a company on personnel and was ordered to pay £2,500 of prosecution costs. Pask, of Loughton, Essex, admitted three counts of obtaining a service by deception and one count of false accounting. Ratnage, of Brentwood, Essex, admitted three counts of obtaining a service by deception, one count of fraud and seven counts of false accounting.","Andrew Ratnage, 50, and his boss Raymond Pask, 54, guilty of scam .

"Each week in Australia, one child under the age of 18 dies from suicide, the Australian Human Rights Commission has found . Each week in Australia, one child under the age of 18 dies from suicide, a new investigation has revealed. The research, publicised by the Australian National Children's Commissioner Megan Mitchell on Thursday, also found that another 50 to 60 children are admitted to hospital each week due to self-harm. The shocking findings from the Australian Human Rights Commission, which were presented to parliament, have called for national research into the policies and support available for children. Intentional self-poisoning was found to make up 82 per cent of the 18,277 self-harm hospitalisations that were recorded by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare between 2007-08 and 2012-13. Indigenous children had a far higher rate of suicide than non-Aboriginal children throughout the different age groups, according to The Australian, with numbers doubling between the ages of four and nine. Suicides amongst indigenous teenagers were also five times higher than that of non-Indigenous teens. The report also identifies suicide as a significant issue for children who are 'sexuality diverse, transgender, gender diverse and intersex,' with a national survey of 1032 children finding 33 per cent of participants had harmed themselves and 16 per cent had attempted suicide. The Australian National Children's Commissioner, Megan Mitchell, is calling for a national move to make statistics of self-harm and suicide in children more readily available . The rate of suicide was found to peek in teenagers aged 14 and 15, who made up 106 deaths between 2007 and 2012 compared to the 14 deaths recorded for 12 and 13-year-olds. Commissioner Mitchell said these figures clearly indicated that national support and interventions need to be re-assessed. 'It is clear that we need to review the timing of interventions and support, and work with children much earlier to build resilience and encourage help seeking,' she said. She also called for a national move to make statistics of self-harm and suicide in children more easily available, to enable better research into the reasons leading to their actions and subsequently, more effective prevention and support mechanisms. Commissioner Mitchell hope the report will lead to more effective prevention and intervention strategies for children across the country . 'To find effective prevention and intervention strategies, we need regular and more detailed surveillance of death and hospitalisation due to intentional self-harm in children aged 4-17 years and a national research agenda', Commissioner Mitchell said. 'Without comprehensive surveillance of intentional self-harm in children, our prevention and early intervention strategies cannot be properly planned or evaluated'. Ms Mitchell told The Australian children need more support from parents, schools and health workers far earlier. She highlighted that youth in foster care and environments dominated by domestic violence, drug abuse or mental illness, presented a high risk.","The shocking findings were presented to parliament this week by the Australian National Children's Commissioner, Megan Mitchell .

The Japanese automaker said in a statement that its count of . underreported claims came from a third-party audit. Honda cited . 'various errors related to data entry' and said it used an . 'overly narrow interpretation' of its legal reporting . requirements. It said it is taking steps to remedy these . shortcomings. 'I haven't got a detailed report yet, but it seems there . were a lot of administrative mistakes on the ground,' Honda CEO . Takanobu Ito said, speaking at a corporate event in Japan on Tuesday. Honda and Japanese supplier Takata Corp have been . at the center of investigations of defects in Takata air bags. Since 2008, Honda has recalled more than 7.5 million U.S. cars . because defects can cause the inflators in some Takata air bags . to rupture, spraying metal shards into vehicle occupants. Asked what Honda had made of an early, pre-recall Takata air . bag accident, in 2004, Ito said: 'We don't have knowledge of . inflators but ... it was difficult to foresee that it would . expand' to similar accidents or recalls. Honda has responded by claiming there had been 'various errors related to data entry',and used an'overly narrow interpretation' of its legal reporting requirements . NHTSA sent a second order to Honda on November 5th, seeking . details and documents related to the air bags and . inflators. Honda sent its response on Monday to NHTSA's first order. A . summary of that response was read out by Rick Schostek, . executive vice president of Honda North America, on a conference . call with reporters, though he declined to take questions. Schostek testified last week at a U.S. Senate Commerce Committee . hearing on Takata air bags. In the 'early warning' reporting data required by U.S. law, . Honda failed to disclose eight incidents of ruptured Takata . inflators that resulted in one death and seven injuries, . Schostek said. The company said it provided details of those . incidents to NHTSA outside the 'early warning' reporting . process. Japanese Transport Minister Akihiro Ohta said on Tuesday his . ministry set up a task force late last week to deal specifically . with Takata's recalls. The ministry is also looking into whether . Honda underreported incidents in Japan, an official said. Separately on Monday, a lawsuit was filed in South Carolina . federal court tying a Takata air bag to the 2008 death of Mary . Lyon Wolfe in a 2002 Honda Accord. The lawsuit said the air bag . in Wolfe's car 'deployed with excessive force' and caused grave . injuries. Wolfe died 18 days later from her injuries, it noted. A Takata spokesman declined to comment. A Honda spokesman . said the company had not yet been served with a copy of the . lawsuit and declined to comment on its specifics. Also on Monday, the Senate requested additional air . bag-related documents from Takata 'to gather information that . could address questions left unanswered' at last week's hearing.","More than 1,700 injuries and deaths involving Honda cars unreported .

"Up to two million obese Britons will be eligible for weight-loss surgery on the NHS under new guidelines. File picture . Up to two million obese Britons will be eligible for weight-loss surgery on the NHS under new guidelines. The health watchdog NICE is telling doctors to suggest the operations to all patients above a given weight with type 2 diabetes. If all those in that group took up the offer it would cost the NHS £12billion. NICE hopes to treble the number of such procedures carried out by the health service to at least 15,000 a year – an extra annual outlay of £90million. The move comes as the NHS struggles to meet targets for what many would regard as more urgent operations. It was revealed in April that nearly three million people were on waiting lists for surgery or other hospital procedures, including almost 550 who had been waiting for more than a year. Simon Stevens, chief executive of the NHS, said: ‘The need for so much bariatric [weight loss] surgery graphically illustrates the price of failure in preventing obesity. 'Do we want a future where our children die younger than their parents and where the NHS is brought to its knees by entirely avoidable illness? That’s the stark choice facing our country.’ NICE has concluded procedures such as gastric bypass operations and gastric bands are the best way to treat obesity, which can lead to type 2 diabetes. But experts accused the watchdog of ignoring ‘swathes of evidence’ that cutting calories is just as effective and far less expensive than surgery. The NICE guidance advises anyone with a Body Mass Index over 30 and type 2 diabetes should be considered for surgery. This is equivalent to a 5ft 6in woman weighing 13st 9lb, or a 5ft 11in man at 15st 6lb. The NHS already spends £10billion a year treating type 2 diabetes and around one in six hospital beds are taken up by a patient with the condition. NICE states surgery can drastically improve the illness, prevent complications and in some cases reverse it. Professor Mark Baker, of the watchdog’s Centre for Clinical Practice, said: ‘The numbers of people classified as obese has nearly doubled over the last 20 years and continues to rise. ‘It is a major issue, if not the major issue, for the health service in the coming years. ‘The value of weight loss surgery to diabetics is one of the best we have come across in our guidance … we think this is one of the things the NHS should invest more in.’ NICE hopes to treble the number of such procedures carried out by the health service to at least 15,000 a year . But Professor Iain Broom, of the Centre for Obesity Research and Education at Robert Gordon University, Aberdeen, said: ‘They have missed swathes of evidence. ‘The NICE guidance could send tens of thousands of Britons towards unnecessary surgery, with its known morbidity and mortality, and costing taxpayers many millions of pounds, when all that is required is a different dietary and lifestyle approach, including the use of low carbohydrate diets and low, and very low, calorie diets. ‘While surgery has its place, it must remain a last resort.’ Barbara Young, chief executive of charity Diabetes UK, added: ‘While weight loss surgery for type 2 diabetes is an important treatment option, it should not be seen as the definitive remedy that can fix the type 2 epidemic on its own. ‘In particular, it makes no sense that the NHS is currently spending more on bariatric surgery than it is on preventative measures to stop people from getting type 2 diabetes in the first place.’ Obese children with type 2 diabetes could be offered the operations but it is only recommended once they have been through puberty so the youngest eligible patients would be 12 or 13. The most effective procedure is a gastric bypass operation whereby surgeons create a small pouch at the top of the stomach. They connect this directly to the small intestine, bypassing the rest of the stomach so that patients only need small amounts of food before they feel full. This causes them to lose weight very quickly and, crucially, it also lowers their blood sugar – which is a key factor in tackling diabetes. The type 2 form of the condition causes kidney failure, strokes and loss of sight, and sufferers’ feet may need to be amputated due to nerve damage. NICE said that 60 per cent of diabetic patients no longer need medication after weight-loss procedures and that the remainder are able to cut back on pills or insulin injections. But not all sufferers will want the surgery and many cash-strapped NHS trusts may refuse to fund it. There is also a risk – around one in 1,000 patients die from a cardiac arrest, while one in 100 suffer either blood clots or internal bleeding. About 4,200 weight-loss operations are carried out on the NHS each year, including around 20 on children as young as 13. The most common are gastric bypass operations but others include gastric bands or gastric balloons.","The health watchdog NICE is telling doctors to suggest the operations to all patients above a given weight with type 2 diabetes .

"Buried beneath the Turkish city of Sardis, archaeologists have discovered what is believed to be an ancient lucky charm, designed to ward off evil spirits. Despite being buried around 2,000 years ago, the two pots are relatively intact and one contains the remains of a perfectly preserved, fragile eggshell. The region was destroyed by an earthquake in AD 17 and it is thought the egg was a ritual offering, used to protect the area from future disasters. Buried beneath the ancient Turkish city of Sardis, archaeologists have discovered two pots dating back 2,000 years. The pots, pictured, are relatively intact and contain the remains of a perfectly preserved eggshell which may have been used to ward off evil spirits . There have been many reports of eggs . being used in ancient rituals, with particular reference to ‘uncrossing’ and warding off demons. Uncrossing is the act of undoing . curses, or reversing bad fortune. The U.S. archaeologists believe the . residents of Sardis would have placed the eggs in the ground to . reverse the bad fortune the earthquake had subjected on the region. It may have also been seen as an . offering to the gods, to help ward off demons and evil spirits that . would want to harm the region. Eggshells were additionally used in so-called ‘demon traps’ in modern-day Iraq and Iran to disarm evil forces. Whole eggs were used to place curses on enemies. Residents of Sardis rebuilt the region following this earthquake, and the settlement remained for centuries until it was finally abandoned in the 1402. The discovery of the pots was made by archaeologists from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the University of Missouri in partnership with the Archaeological Exploration of Sardis. The artefacts were found buried beneath what would have been an elite building in the city that was once the capital of the ancient kingdom of Lydia. In addition to the eggshell, the researchers also found small bronze tools and a coin. The eggshell had been deliberately pierced, to allow the insides to flow out, but the rest of the shell had remained in one piece.

"California's grape growers say they are expecting one of the earliest harvests seen to date - and it's all because of the weather. Although the state enjoys a balmy climate all year round, this year's unexpectedly dry Spring has hastened the arrival of this year's crop. What's more, say wine experts, the unseasonably early harvest could result in vintages that are 'bolder' and stronger than usual. Rapidly ripening: These syrah grapes are turning from green to purple with harvest now just three weeks away . The white stuff: For growers of white and champagne grapes, harvest has already begun . Flavoursome: Despite the early crop, the taste of the resulting wines won't be affected . Farmers usually have to wait until . August for the first signs of ripening but say grapes are already . turning purple and expect to gather in the fruit three weeks early. According to Tom Davies, the owner of V. Sattui Winery in Napa Valley, the sight of swiftly purpling fruit marks the start of a three week countdown to harvest. 'It's all due to the weather,' he revealed in an interview with ABC News. 'The dry spring kick started the grape growing season.' Although an early harvest isn't entirely without precedent, it happens on average once every 10 years, with the last recorded in 2009 according to growers. But while the red wine grapes still have another few weeks to go, the white grapes are ready now according to champagne grape growers, who say they will start bringing in the crop next week. Happily for Californian wine lovers, the unusually early harvest won't have an impact on the taste of the eventual wine. 'If we have an earlier harvest, for the north coast, it's a good thing because this is a cooler climate area,' added Davies. 'If we can get the grapes in sooner then we're not backed up into late October and early November and that's when bad things happen.'","Syrah and other red grape varieties are ripening three weeks early .

"They were the trousers that kickstarted the 90s trend for builder's bottoms and low-slung jeans but caused controversy when they made their catwalk debut in 1993. Alexander McQueen's infamous 'bumsters', which made their first appearance in the late designer's 'Nihilism' collection, are among the most iconic of his many designs. Now a prototype pair made for a friend in 1992 is to go under the hammer - and auctioneers expect the trousers to fetch at least £1,000. Risque: A pair of Alexander McQueen's low-slung bumster trousers on the catwalk in 1993 . The trousers are being sold by Kerry Taylor Auctions as part of their Passion For Fashion sale, which takes place on the 9th December and also includes pieces by Chanel, Issey Miyake and Jean Paul Gaultier among others. Also going under the hammer are rare 18th and 19th century garments, including a selection of dainty shoes dating from 1780 and a rare pair of swashbuckling Marlborough Bucket Boots made circa 1670 and expected to fetch somewhere in the region of £3,000. But it is the bumsters that have proved the item of most interest to buyers - something that comes as no surprise to auction boss Taylor. 'These trousers are historically very important as they were the major new fashion statement of the 1990s,' she explains. 'What's more, they were made by Lee McQueen himself.' Alexander McQueen first introduced the world to his ‘Bumster’ trousers in his ‘Nihilism’ Spring-Summer 1994 collection - and the critics had a field day. Prototype: This pair of early bumster trousers were made for McQueen's friend Trixie Bellair . Revealing: The trousers measure just 7in from crotch to waistband but are expected to fetch £1,000 . Talent: McQueen, who died in 2010, was one of the most talented British designers to emerge in recent years . Many in the fashion press mockingly compared them to the clothes usually worn by builders but despite their best efforts, the trousers became a McQueen signature and regularly appeared in collections throughout his career. The first pair of bumsters came into being in December 1992 and were made by McQueen as a present for his close friend, the drag artist, Trixie Bellair. Crafted from shiny grey suiting fabric with a single button and zip fastening to the back, the measurement from the crotch to the waistband is a mere 7in. The designer later borrowed them back from Trixie to copy in advance of his Nihilism' S/S 1994 collection, where they caused a furore when they first appeared on the catwalk. Speaking about the controversial trousers in an interview a year before his death, McQueen said that his invention had helped to create a new erogenous zone. 'To me that part of the body, not so much the buttocks but the bottom of the spine, that’s the most erotic part of anyone’s body,' he said. 'Man or woman.

"It was the last formal photoshoot of legendary Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain, just months before his tragic suicide in April 1994. When the lead singer showed up to the shoot three hours late with a large pair of white Jackie O sunglasses, American photographer Jesse Frohman recalls Cobain politely and quietly asking him for a bucket. The 51-year-old, who was shooting the rock band for a magazine feature at the time, said ‘sure, but what for?’ Cobain responded, ‘cause I think I’m gonna puke’. Now, 20 years after his death, the photographer will pay tribute to the music legend by exhibiting his exclusive collection, featuring photographs that have never before seen or printed in Australia. Scroll down for video . About five months before Cobain died, Jesse Frohman was commissioned by Sunday Observer magazine of London to shoot Nirvana . ‘I’m curious to see if people in Sydney have an interest in Kurt Cobain because you think it would be the same response as New York but I’ve been to other countries and it was different.  So it’ll be interesting because I don't know what to expect,’ he told Daily Mail Australia. ‘But I’m very excited because it's going to be my first time in Australia and it’s going to be a fun experience to share my photographs with Nirvana fans and photography lovers.' When asked whether he had a favourite photograph of Cobain from the shoot, Frohman said there were too many to choose from. ‘I have several favourites from the shoot – I reckon there's equally four or five that I appreciate the most. I was fortunate enough to take more than a few of the most iconic pics from the shoot. American photographer Jesse Frohman (pictured) will exhibit his exclusive collection of photographs of Kurt Cobain and Nirvana in Australia for the first time . The pictures were taken at the height of Nirvana’s success during their In Utero tour, while behind the scenes Cobain continued to battle drug and alcohol addiction . In 1993, Nirvana was the biggest band in the world, and Kurt Cobain was subject to an intense level of celebrity and public scrutiny . ‘I love the black and white – full length shot of him just standing there, holding a bottle in one hand and hanging his head to the side because it says everything – it's intriguing and passionate and tells so much about his story. ‘The close-up shots of his head and shoulder – one in particular that looks like his brushing his teeth but he’s smoking a cigarette – these photos captured the real moments of him that I love. ‘Another picture I quite love is the one with his mouth open and he’s looking up into the sky.' Band members Dave Grohl and Krist Novocelic arrived promptly at 11am when the shoot was scheduled over one day in November 1993, but the lead singer was nowhere to be found. The shoot was scheduled to take five hours so Frohman and his assistants quickly put together a makeshift studio in a small room at the New York’s Omni hotel where the group was staying. ‘We only had 30 minutes to shoot the band in the studio and their rehearsal later that day but I wish I had more time to work with Kurt,’ Frohman said. ‘But it was still a great experience and he was so easy to work with and I loved it because he was very nice, patient and attitude-free with the camera – he was never controlling.’ It was the last formal photo shoot Nirvana ever did before the songwriter took his own life at the age of 27 . Frohman and his assistants quickly put together a makeshift studio in a small room at the New York hotel where the group was staying . On April 5th 1994, the singer-songwriter took his own life at the age of 27. ‘I was getting a lot of phone calls that day from my friends to tell me about the news,’ Frohman said. ‘It was really sad and I was shocked and the people who knew him well were shocked. ‘I knew he tried to commit suicide before but you don’t think anyone would do it until they do. ‘It was shocking because he was one of the most well-known rockstars at the time so why would someone do that? It was a real surprise. ‘It’s always sad to see someone feel they have no hope and happiness in life, but it was his life and he chose to do it – he wanted to leave the world.’ In New York City to play the famed Roseland Ballroom and promote their new album In Utero, Cobain and Nirvana were photographed byJesse Frohman .

Buerk’s tribulations have fuelled speculation he might follow in the footsteps of reality star Gemma Collins and actor Craig Charles, who have already pull out of this series of the hit ITV show. However, he wife was keen to assure viewers this would not be the case. She said: ‘Michael isn’t a quitter. I don’t see him walking out. He’s been in worse places. He’s been shot at, he’s been gassed, he’s been blown up in an ammunition dump explosion, he’s seen a sound guy die, he’s seen a cameraman lose his arm. 'He’s been in real reality situations that have been very tough. I would be really, really surprised if he broke.’ Despite describing her husband as ‘my pin-up’, Mrs Buerk has been ‘amused’ by tweets from viewers telling him to ‘get your top back on’. She said this is different from when he was in his prime as a reporter and newsreader, when he earned a loyal and loving following. She said: ‘When Michael was presenting the news, it was a big audience. 'It’s not like today when audiences are much more fragmented. When you’re presenting the news like he did, you become very important to lonely people. 'There’s a reliable face coming into the living room every night. He’s definitely had a few nice letters over the years.’ However, even given his three decade career at the BBC, where he became accustomed to reporting from the grim conditions of El Salvador and apartheid South Africa, Buerk will still find the rigours of the jungle a shock, according to his wife. Christine Buerk (pictured) is now supporting her husband from Australia having flown in earlier this week . The journalist opened up this week about his regrets over never asking his mother about his bigamist father . She said: ‘I know he would say El Salvador is the toughest place he’s ever been to. It was a very, very frightening place where you’re not sure whether you’re going to get killed any minute. Paces where there are lots of guns and they’ve got into the hands of drugged-up kids. 'He’s been to a lot of scary places. It’s a different type of scary to the jungle. He’s been very lucky that he hasn’t had to do any of the eating trials yet. I don’t know how he’d get on with eating something wriggling, but I think he’s certainly faced tougher situations’. Are you watching this year's I'm A Celebrity? Are you watching this year's I'm A Celebrity? Now share your opinion . No matter how dire the situation, Buerk – who opened up this week about his regrets over never asking his mother about his bigamist father – can always turn to his campmates for support and his bond with chart-topping rap star Tinchy Stryder, 28, has been one of the surprising highlights of the series. Talking previously about their relationship, Buerk said: ‘We get on well because we are complete opposites. 'He is young and hip and edgy. He is a really interesting guy. I am at least two or maybe even three generations separated from him. I am stuffy, stuck up, middle class and middle aged. And white, of course. Opposites attract.’ And commenting yesterday, he wife said: ‘I think it’s great, although he’s practically old enough to be Tinchy’s grandfather! 'The show opened up with Michael on his own and then Tinchy was the next person to arrive. Whether their bonding sprang from that original meeting, I don’t know.’ The journalist was given a private rap lesson by Stryder, whose verdict on Buerk was, ‘a cool dude, he’s so uncool that he’s cool.’","Michael Buerk looks visibly slimmer since he arrived in Australian jungle .

"Scientists have found a new way to 'switch off' pain, and it could lead to the development of non-addictive drugs for millions of patients suffering chronic discomfort. Researchers managed to block a pain pathway in rodents with chronic neuropathic pain, which develops due to nerve damage. They did this by switching on a receptor, known as A3, in a rat's brain and spinal cord to counteract intense feelings of discomfort. Scientists have found a new way to stop pain, which could one day alleviate suffering for people who suffer intense pain caused by bone cancer and chemotherapy, for example (stock image) Current treatments for pain are problematic because they cause intolerable side effects, diminish quality of life and do not sufficiently quell pain, the scientists say. But their new method could avoid nasty side effects from current pain relief drugs, such as addiction or increasing tolerance, meaning that people need to take higher and stronger doses of medication. The new method could avoid nasty side effects from current pain relief drugs (illustrated with a stock image), such as addiction or tolerance, meaning that people need to take higher doses . Earlier this week scientists announced that they have created ‘pain in a dish’ by converting skin cells into sensitive neurons in a bid to learn more about these sensations. The lab-created nerve cells respond to a range of different kinds of pain stimulation, including physical injury, chronic inflammation and cancer chemotherapy. And in the future, the custom-made neurons could be used to investigate the origins of pain and develop better pain-relieving drugs. The work follows years of unsuccessful attempts to produce nerve cells from embryonic stem cells, which are immature ‘blank slate’ cells with the potential to become any tissue in the body. A turning point came with the development of technology that allowed ordinary skin cells to be reprogrammed into ‘induced’ stem cells. The scientists dubbed the complex process 'transcription-mediated lineage conversion of fibroblasts.' Scientists at Saint Louis University in Missouri, discovered that activating the A3 receptor in rodents – using a native chemical stimulator called adenosine, or synthetic drugs - prevents or reverses pain caused by nerve damage without side effects. Their study is published in the medical journal, Brain. Daniela Salvemini, Professor of pharmacological and physiological sciences at the university, demonstrated the ability of the A3 adenosine receptor to mediate pain relieving effects of the chemical adenosine. ‘It has long been appreciated that harnessing the potent pain-killing effects of adenosine could provide a breakthrough step towards an effective treatment for chronic pain,’ she said. ‘Our findings suggest that this goal may be achieved by focusing future work on the A3AR pathway, in particular, as its activation provides robust pain reduction across several types of pain.’ The chemical is already being investigated by experts as anti-inflammatory and anticancer agent.","Researchers from Saint Louis University in Missouri managed to block a pain pathway in rodents with chronic neuropathic pain .

"A diplomatic row between Belarus and Sweden over teddy bears escalated today when the eastern European country withdrew its embassy staff from Stockholm. Belarus also told Sweden to take similar action with its diplomats in Minsk. It all stems from a stunt by a Swedish PR which parachuted 800 teddy bears into Belarus last month. Scroll down for video . PR stunt: Teddy bears parachuting over a residential area in Minsk, Belarus on July 4 . Diplomatic row: The president of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko (pictured), has sacked senior members of his staff over the teddy bear incident and is now taking his fury out on Sweden . The company chartered a light aircraft which invaded Belarussian airspace to drop the bears, all of which highlighted the lack of human rights in the former Soviet state. A furious Belarus president, Alexander Lukashenko, has sacked senior members of his staff over the incident and is now taking his fury out on Sweden. Belarus expelled Sweden's ambassador on August 3. The Belarussian ambassador to Stockholm was also withdrawn. The foreign ministry said Minsk was now pulling out its remaining embassy staff because Sweden had aggravated the situation by expelling two more diplomats and had refused to allow a new Belarussian ambassador to take up his post. 'In this connection, the Belarussian side has been forced to take the decision to withdraw its embassy in Sweden and bring back all its (embassy) staff to Belarus,' the statement said. Sweden's Foreign Minister Carl Bildt wrote on Twitter: 'His fear of human rights reaching new heights.' Swedish Tomas Mazetti, left, and Hannah Frey, right, show a teddy bear on a parachute before the stunt was unleashed . The diplomatic row between Belarus and Sweden was stepped up after 800 teddy bears were dropped over the eastern European country . The teddies, with pro democracy signs attached, were dropped by Swedish activists from Studio Total.  The incident was initially denied by the authorities . The incident was a humiliation for President Alexander Lukashenko, a hardliner who has been in power in Belarus since 1994 and is on poor terms with the West because of his harsh policies towards the political opposition. European Union ambassadors will hold an emergency meeting on Friday on the issue, an EU source in Brussels said. 'There will be an emergency meeting of the European Union ambassadors Friday to decide on appropriate measures,' the source said on condition of anonymity, adding that the meeting would be held in Brussels. Sweden's four remaining diplomats in Belarus have been ordered to leave the authoritarian-ruled country following a 'teddy bear' incident that has soured relations between the two countries . Time to leave: An Swedish embassy employee adjusts a Swedish flag on a Swedish embassy in the centre of Minsk, Belarus . Bildt last week said ambassador Stefan Eriksson, who took up the post in Minsk in 2008, was expelled because of his pro-rights stance and meetings he had with the Belarus opposition. Stockholm retaliated immediately, saying . it would not welcome a new ambassador named by Minsk to replace an . envoy who left the post several weeks ago, and withdrew residency . permits for two Belarus diplomats who were asked to leave the . Scandinavian country. '[Lukashenko's] fear of human rights reaching new heights.' Swedenish Minister Carl Bildt . Belarus . foreign ministry spokesman Andrei Savinykh denied last week that . Eriksson had been expelled, saying instead in more diplomatic language . that 'a decision was made not to renew his credentials.' Eriksson's 'activity was aimed not at strengthening Belarusian-Swedish relations but destroying them,' he said. On Wednesday, Minsk said in a statement it was 'forced to take a decision to recall its diplomatic staff from Sweden and return its employees to Belarus,' stressing however it was not severing diplomatic ties with Stockholm. It also gave Stockholm until August 30 to remove all of its diplomats from Minsk. Sweden has been actively pushing for democracy in Belarus. An activist from women's rights group Femen fights with a police officer, as the group protests against the plans of Belarus' President Alexander Lukashenko to attend the Euro 2012 final in July . Sweden's Foreign Minister Carl Bildt wrote on Twitter: 'His fear of human rights reaching new heights.' Lukashenko's re-election in December 2010, marred by fraud, led Stockholm to focus its Belarus strategy on democracy, human rights and equality. 'The state-run international development policy and the lack of a clear democratisation process make the cooperation particularly challenging,' the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency said on its website. Bildt reiterated Sweden's commitment to Belarusian human rights on Wednesday, writing on Twitter: 'We remain strongly committed to the freedom of Belarus and all its citizens. They deserve the freedoms and the rights of the rest of Europe.' By meeting with members of the opposition, ambassador Eriksson 'followed the policies that Sweden defends', Bildt said last week. Sweden's embassy in Minsk opened in 2008. Prior to that, the country was represented by its mission in Moscow, which had a representative in Minsk. The embassy counts four diplomats and a SIDA representative, as well as a handful of local staff. 'Two or three diplomats are currently there,' ministry spokesman Joerle said. Belarus is under a raft of sanctions by the European Union over the plight of political prisoners in the country.

"Two boys who had gone out to build a snow fort were inadvertently trapped for four hours in a Newburgh, New York, snow bank when a plow operator clearing a parking lot pushed snow over them, not realizing they were there, officials said. The boys – cousins Jason ‘J.J.’ Rivera, 9, Elijah ‘Papito’ Martinez, 11 - spent Thanksgiving in the hospital after the terrifying accident, which police said could have killed them. Authorities said the boys' parents became alarmed when they didn't come home from playing around 10 p.m., and after a fruitless search called police around 11:50 p.m. on Wednesday.

During their search that officers learned that the boys had been building a snow fort in the area of the nearby Family Health Center. They boys had been digging the fort out of the snow bank, when the plow truck came through and trapped them, police said. Officials finally found the boys around 2 a.m. on Thursday, after an officer saw a shovel half buried in the snow bank. The officer took the shovel and started to dig, and saw a small boot. Others joined in, some digging with bare hands, and the boys were found. A neighbor captured cell phone footage of the police and others frantically digging the boys out of the snow at 2 a.m. on Thursday morning . They were conscious and suffering from exposure. Authorities said a snow plow operator had been clearing a parking lot by pushing snow over, and didn't see the boys on the other side of the pile. The boys ended up buried to the point where they could not move their arms and legs. 'They were probably in about five feet of snow,' Newburgh police Sgt. Aaron Weaver told CBS New York. 'But however it fell, there was, like, a dome around their heads, so there was air in there, like space for them.' Weaver, who was among the rescuers, said the dome of air was the only thing that saved them. Both the victims were recovering on Thursday night at Westchester Medical Center in Valhalla. Family members said they are in a good condition. Newburgh is about 60 miles north of New York City and had received more than a half-foot of snow.

"A former police chief in a New Mexico border town collected more than $2,000 a month from the notorious Juarez Cartel in exchange for protection and help with smuggling drugs and guns, a former town official testified on Wednesday. Blas 'Woody' Gutierrez, the former Columbus village trustee, told a federal court that former Police Chief Angelo Vega also received $1,500 each time he allowed cartel members to use village vehicles, including police cruisers, for the syndicate's various operations. That testimony came in a trial involving Danny Burnett, a former school superintendent who is charged with leaking information about a federal wiretap investigation into a Columbus gun and drug smuggling ring. Former Columbus police chief Angelo Vegas is accused of accepting $2,000 a month from the Juarez Cartel in exchange for helping them smuggle drugs and guns . It was the first time such details from the 2011 gun smuggling case have been made public since many of the defendants have pleaded guilty, reports the Albuquerque Journal. Vega is the key prosecution witness in the case against Burnett, the husband of Assistant U.S. Attorney Paula Burnett, who has not been charged with any crime. Gutierrez faces 10 years in federal prison for his guilty plea to 37 counts of smuggling, illegally purchasing firearms and conspiracy linked to the case. Vega also testified Wednesday that he didn't remember exactly how much he was paid or how long he worked for the cartel. Vega, together with Blas 'Woody' Gutierrez, left, and former Mayor Eddie Espinoza, right, were among more than a dozen defendants who pleaded guilty in the case . But he admitted running background checks and license plates at the request of cartel members and buying military gear at law enforcement supply stores for members of the Juarez Cartel and its enforcement arm, La Linea. Gutierrez said Vega told him that he had a friend whose wife worked in the U.S. Attorney's Office and that the friend told Vega their telephones were tapped. Gutierrez said he was not sure Vega was telling the truth until the two men met in Columbus and Vega destroyed his new phone in front of Gutierrez. 'He did it to show he wasn't messing around,' Gutierrez said. Gutierrez also testified that Vega claimed his friend could make the case go away for $20,000. Former Police Chief Angelo Vega, left, is also accused of receiving $1,500 each time he allowed cartel members to use village vehicles, including police cruisers, for the syndicate's various operations . Other government witnesses testified that no one in the U.S. Attorney's Office could make a criminal case 'go away' and that it would be impossible in an investigation as intensive as the one targeting the Columbus gun smuggling ring. Assistant U.S. attorneys involved in the investigation testified that the quantity and quality of telephone conversations dropped after Feb. 17, 2011, the day Vega had lunch with Danny Burnett at an Albuquerque restaurant. Gutierrez, Vega and former Mayor Eddie Espinoza were among more than a dozen defendants who pleaded guilty in the case.","Angelo Vegas is accused of accepting $2,000 a month from the Juarez Cartel in exchange for helping them smuggle drugs and guns .

"From mince pies to gallons of glühwein, the festive season is a difficult time for dieters. But one group of slimmers will have so such trouble. Josie Gibson, who has lost 6st in just one year, Geordie Shore's slender size six Vicky Pattison and TOWIE's Frankie Essex are just three of the reality stars who have ended 2014 slimmer than when they started. But their stunning weight loss isn't the result of surgery or extreme diets. Instead, as FEMAIL reveals, clean living, healthy food and plenty of exercise are the secrets of their success. Josie Gibson has lost the most weight of all the reality television ladies having transformed herself from a size 20 (left) to a slim size 8 (right) JOSIE GIBSON . Total weight lost: 6 stone 5 lbs . Dress size at her biggest: 20 . Dress size now: 8 . How she did it: Josie decided it was time to go on a diet after seeing unflattering pictures of herself frolicking on the beach. The former Big Brother star described herself as looking like a 'beast.' Since then, she has has shed almost 7st and now weighs a healthy 10st 2lbs. So successful has her diet been, she has even released a book - The Josie Gibson Diet - which explains how she did it. In it, Josie credits cutting sugar from her diet for her weight loss, she followed a 1,250 calorie-a-day high protein, low-fat diet. She also worked with personal trainer James Stark who made sure she trained for 20 minutes a day. 'I used to give my body 0 out of 10,' says a delighted Josie. ' I don’t want to be big-headed, but I’ve worked hard, so now I’d give myself a 9! I’m no longer afraid to walk around naked!' Star of Geordie Shore Charlotte Crosby has lost a considerable amount of weight this year. In May (left) she was a size 14 but just a couple of months later she was slimmer and happier . CHARLOTTE CROSBY . Total weight lost: 2st 7lbs . Dress size at her largest: 14 . Dress size now: 8 . How she did it: Charlotte's diet was not the most conventional. Her co-star Vicky Pattison revealed that she uses a controversial sounding 'three tin' regime. 'She basically thinks you should eat three tins a day and that's it. So you could have a tin of beans for your breakfast, tin of tuna for your dinner and a tin of pears for your tea,' said Vicky. Charlotte also instagrammed a picture of herself working out with celebrity trainer Richard Callender. Vicky Pattison gorged on take aways and booze in the Geordie Shore house but lost weight after the girls started eating healthy catered food . VICKY PATTISON . Total weight lost: 3st . Dress size at her biggest: 16 . Dress size now: 6 . How she did it: Just like Charlotte and Holly, Vicky tucked into a diet of takeaways and alcohol in the Geordie Shore house and piled on the pounds as a result. Now, she's a svelte size six after insisting that producers provide the reality show stars with a healthier menu - something she says has 'made all the difference'. 'It’s made such a difference,' she says. 'You don’t get much time to cook, so we used to have a crisps cupboard and a chocolate drawer, which we'd descend on like a pack of raccoons after a night out. 'With the catering, we swapped our fry ups for eggs or porridge for breakfast and then salads and meat platters for lunch. That made keeping our figures loads easier.' Vicky also followed the her own Seven Day Slim routine which saw her shed three stone over the course of six months. Following her dramatic slim down she was unhappy with the way her breasts look and recently had a boob job to plump them back up again. Frankie recently revealed that she had lost two stone after she started working out with trainer Ian Guildford (left), earlier this week (right) she looked happy to be out and showing off her figure . FRANKIE ESSEX . Total weight lost: 2st . Dress size at her biggest: 14 . Dress size now: 10 . How she did it: Frankie Essex recently shed 2st after finding her weight had crept up thanks to a diet of microwave meals and 10am pizzas. Now she works out four times a week with celebrity trainer Ian Guildford-  who previously worked with Binky Felstead and Luissa Zissman. 'I was panic-stricken when I first started working out with the trainer,' said the star of the fraught early days of her fitness regime. 'I didn't think I would be able to cope and there were times when I was so worried about it that I had difficulty breathing. 'But once I got into a regular routine, I could really feel my life turning around. I now feel so much more confident and healthier.' Holly Hagan followed a calorie controlled diet and worked out with a personal trainer two or three times a week to drop from a size 16 to a size 10 . HOLLY HAGAN . Total weight lost: 1st 7lbs . Dress size at her biggest: 16 . Dress size now: 10 . How she did it: Geordie Shore star Holly makes sure she trains three times a week and says: 'I do work hard to maintain my body as I work with a personal trainer 2/3 times a week, and we train really hard together.' She also maintains a calorie controlled diet and has previously revealed that she prioritises fruit and vegetables over stodgy treats. 'Carrots before carbs,' she explains. 'I've been doing it for so long now that when I eat s*** it makes me feel bad. I prefer to be healthy now.' A typical day for her would be scrambled eggs for breakfast, a chicken salad for lunch, and for dinner, steak and vegetables. Back in 2013 (left) Chanelle felt uncomfortable with her size 16 body whilst on holiday in Tenerife, however this year she has slimmed down to a size 8 . CHANELLE HAYES . Total weight lost: 4st . Dress size at her biggest: 16 . Dress size now: 8 . How she did it: Chanelle decided she needed to do something about her body after becoming 'addicted' to fatty and processed foods. 'Food can be an abused substance, especially carbs and processed foods,' she explained. 'It's addictive, especially when you're depressed.' To beat the bulge, she followed the TrimSecrets plan, which was designed by Ultimo boss Michelle Mone. It involves a 1,500 calorie diet, plus a course of TrimSecrets supplements which are designed to kick start your metabolism. 'I'd hate to underplay the hard work and commitment it has taken; but it's been relatively easy thanks to the TrimSecrets programme,' she added. 'I knew what I had to do and – with the help of the step-by-step guide – I stuck to it and watched the weight fall off. I definitely feel back to my best!' Chanelle also exercised regularly to keep her body slim.","Reality TV stars have lost a total of 20 stone between them .

"The Italian Senate has expelled three-time ex-Premier Silvio Berlusconi from Parliament over his tax fraud conviction. The move halts the 77-year-old Berlusconi's legislative run for at least six years, but does not mark the end of his political career. Berlusconi maintained his defiance ahead of the vote, declaring today as a 'day of mourning for democracy' before thousands of cheering, flag-waving supporters outside his Roman palazzo. Expelled: Silvio Berlusconi pauses as he addresses his supporters during a rally in Rome today . Even though Berlusconi won't hold a seat in Parliament, he is expected to remain influential in Italian politics. He has relaunched his Forza Italia party and analysts estimate he still commands millions of supporters. The Senate speaker declared he was ineligible for a seat in parliament after the house rejected a series of challenges by Berlusconi's supporters to a proposal for his expulsion. No formal vote was held. Berlusconi was sentenced in August to four years in prison, commuted to a year under house arrest or in community service, for masterminding an illegal scheme to reduce the tax bill of his media company Mediaset. Silvio Berlusconi gestures during a speech in downtown Rome today ahead of the meeting which expelled him from the Italian Senate . Silvio Berlusconi, left, waves to his supporters during a rally in Rome where he declared today a day of mourning . Forza Italia party's supporters wave flags as Silvio Berlusconi addresses a rally in Rome . The ex-politician, who was also found guilty of having sex with an underage prostitute at his infamous bunga bunga parties. He was sentenced to seven years in jail for that offence and for abuse of office for trying to cover up the crime, but he still has two levels of appeal before the conviction and eventual punishment is confirmed. New documents released to a Milan court this week show that prosecutors were satisfied that Berlusconi had sex with Karima El Mahroug knowing she was underage - a consensus which led to his conviction in for using underage prostitutes earlier this year. In an explosive document it was revealed that the court found 'it is proved that the defendant had sexual relations with Miss El Mahroug - known as Ruby the Heartstealer -  in exchange for considerable sums of money and other items such as jewellery.' Judges also concluded that the disgraced politician was the director of bunga bunga parties where female guests ' worked to satisfy the desires of the defendant... staging lap dances and stripteases'. High flying: The court documents revealed that Miss Mahroug was given 'considerable sums of money' and jewellery to have sex with the Prime Minister . The case involving Miss El Mahroug is just the latest in a long line of scandals that has seen the 77-year-old former leader rarely out of the Italian courts in the last few years. In August the disgraced politician lost his final appeal over a fraud conviction which handed him a four-year jail term. Shockingly Italian polls repeatedly show that many would still vote for him despite his outragous personal life. Despite losing his appeal the media tycoon is unlikely to see the inside of a jail any time soon. His four year sentence has already been reduced to one year - under an amnesty for crimes committed before 2006 -  because of his age and he has opted for the cushier choice of 12 months' community service. Bitter dispute: Veronica Lario and Berlusconi pictured in 2004 before she filed for divorce in 2009. In an open letter open published around the same time she said she and her children had suffered through her husband's affairs . This means that although he will have to join other convicts in carrying out menial tasks, such as cutting the grass in public parks, painting sheltered accommodation or picking up litter he will not be punished with any form or imprisonment or even house arrest. Berlusconi was famously divorced in 2009 by ex-wife Veronica Lario after she saw him photographed at an underwear model's 18th birthday party. At the time she said she could no longer stay with someone who spent time with 'minors' and pointed out that he had never turned up to any of his own children's 18th birthday parties. Earlier in the year the billionaire had been forced to take out full-page adverts in the newspapers to apologise to her for telling another woman - a guest at a TV awards dinner - that he wanted to marry her instead. Berlusconi was married to Miss Lario for the best part of 20 years and has three children with her - Barbara, 29, Eleonora, 27, and Luigi, 25. He was previously married to Carla Elvira Dell’Oglio with whom he had his first two children Marina, 47, and Pier Silvio, 44. Last month he reportedly married his fiancée in a secret wedding at his private chapel. The three-time Italian premier, who is nearly 50 years older than his bride, wed former TV showgirl Francesca Pascale, 28, at a church inside his palatial villa near Milan in early October. The couple, who met when Miss Pascale was a teenage activist in Berlusconi's his Forza Italia party, wed despite a string of allegations that their relationship is ‘a sham’.","The move halts the 77-year-old's legislative run for at least six years .

"Archaeologists have unearthed ancient golden artefacts, including a tiara with animal motifs and a horse head piece, during excavation works at a Thracian tomb in northern Bulgaria. The significant finds are dated back to the end of the fourth or the beginning of the third century BC and were found in the biggest of 150 ancient tombs of a Thracian tribe, the Getae, that was in contact with the ancient Greeks. The findings, at the Omurtag mount near the village of Sveshatari, also included a golden ring, 44 applications of female figures as well as 100 golden buttons. Touching history: An archaeologist displays a gold tiara engraved with a lion's head and other animals found at the Bulgarian tomb. It is part of an incredible and historically-significant haul . Intricate: History experts say the finds are likely to be remnants from the ritual burial of Gath ruler Kotela, one of the father-in-laws of Philip II of Macedon, the father of Alexander the Great. (Right) A golden horse head piece . 'These are amazing findings from the apogee of the rule of the Getae,' said Diana Gergova, head of the archaeologist team at the site of the ancient Getic burial complex situated near the village of Sveshtari, some 400 km northeast from Sofia. 'From what we see up to now, the tomb may be linked with the first known Getic ruler Cothelas,' said Gergova, a renowned researcher of Thracian culture with the Sofia-based National Archaeology Institute. Gergova explains that it seemed the treasure was wrapped in a gold-woven cloth because a number of gold threads were discovered nearby. These were, most likely, remnants from a ritual burial, said the professor, adding the team expects to discover a huge burial ground, probably related to the funeral of the Gath ruler Kotela, one of the father-in-laws of Philip II of Macedon - Alexander the Great's father. Crafted: A pair of golden artefacts that date back to the end of the fourth or beginning of the third century BC . Valuable: The artefacts are Thracian. Modern Bulgaria is viewed as the geographical cradle of Thracian civilisation . She notes this is a unique find, never before discovered in Bulgaria, according to Novinite. One of the tombs there, known as the Tomb of Sveshtari, is included in the World Heritage List of U.N. education and culture agency, UNESCO, for its unique architectural decor with half-human, half-plant female figures and painted murals. The find is so significant that Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov has arranged to see it at the National Archaeological Museum in Sofia where the treasure is currently placed. The Thracians, ruled by a powerful warrior aristocracy rich in gold treasures, inhabited an area extending over modern Romania and Bulgaria, northern Greece and the European part of Turkey from as early as 4,000 BC. They lived on the fringes of the Greek and Roman civilisations, often intermingling and clashing with the more advanced cultures until they were absorbed into the Roman Empire around 45 AD. Archaeologists have discovered a large number of artefacts in Bulgaria's Thracian tombs in recent decades, providing most of what is known of their culture, as they had no written language and left no enduring records. Insight: The excavations near the village of Sveshtari have been a rich source of information about the mysterious Thracians .","Beautifully-preserved treasures found in Bulgarian historical site .

"Commemorating the atrocities committed by the Nazis is usually a sombre duty, not a cause for joy. But at the Miss Holocaust Survivor Beauty Pageant, the emphasis is firmly on celebrating the remarkable women who survived the genocide of the Jews. The 16 contestants at the event in Israel, all aged over 70, showed off their mature beauty as they competed to take the crown as the nation's most striking senior citizen. Showtime: Koka Salmon, 79, gets ready to go on stage during the Miss Holocaust Survivor Beauty Pageant . Dignity: The pageant celebrates the courage of women like Hannah Liebman, 80 . Line-up: A total of 16 women, all aged over 70, entered the second edition of the annual contest . The pageant, held in the town of Haifa, was held for the second time on Thursday, following on from the success of last year's inaugural edition. It is organised by the International Christian Embassy, an evangelical group that supports Israel, in collaboration with a charity for Holocaust survivors. The aim is to boost the self-esteem of the women involved by bringing a touch of glamour to their lives. While the contestants are certainly encouraged to look their best in sparkling ballgowns, officials say the event is meant to celebrate inner beauty as well. Joy: Ms Koka blows a kiss at the crowd as she is handed an award during the ceremony . Champion: 93-year-old Shoshana Colmer, who is tattooed with an identity number from Auschwitz, was crowned the overall winner of the event . Last minute: One contestant touches up her lipstick as she prepares to go on stage with the others . Many of the women are now fairly infirm, and have little opportunity to dress up at formal events.In the run-up to the event, the 16 finalists were given the use of make-up artists and hairdressers. The winner of this year's pageant was Shoshana Colmer, 93, who was brought up in Czechoslovakia before being imprisoned in Auschwitz. She still bears the identity number which was branded on her skin by the Nazis, and during the contest she told a story about how she would sing for a guard in order to secure extra rations of bread. Since moving to Israel, she has not always been free of troubles - in 2006, her house near the border with Lebanon was destroyed by a rocket fired by jihadist group Hezbollah. All-important: Ayala Situsi has her hair done before the start of the pageant in Haifa . Changing room: The women were provided with make-up artists to keep them looking their best . Anticipation: Ms Situsi, 75, waits patiently before the start of the pageant . While the women involved seemed delighted to have been invited to the pageant, not everyone is so positive. Critics claim the pageant exploits vulnerable elderly people by putting them on show for entertainment. 'I'm not sure I'm happy with this beauty pageant because pageants objectify women and also because there is a sensational dimension,' Dalia Sivan, of Holocaust survivors' charity of Amcha, told USA Today. 'The survivors' suffering is on display in a very public way.'","Event in Haifa celebrates courage of remaining Holocaust survivors .

"A Welsh policeman has become an internet star after he was filmed performing a Maori-style Haka in the middle of a street before a rugby match. PC Rob Green spends most of his days responding to serious crashes on Wales' roads, but found himself bringing Cardiff city centre to a standstill as he joined rugby fans for the tribal war cry. PC Green, wearing full armour and his police helmet, needed little coercion to join in with Welsh fans before the clash with New Zealand last Saturday. Welsh policeman Rob Green joined in the Haka with Wales and New Zealand fans before the two teams met at the Millennium Stadium last weekend . PC Green, wearing his helmet and full body armour, said he joined the tribal war cry to show the 'human side' of policing . The enthusiastic officer had onlookers in stitches as he performed the Haka, which was caught on camera. More than 120,000 people have watched the policeman's imitation of the All Blacks' pre-match ritual and the video has been shared on Twitter and Facebook more than 22,000 times. PC Green said: 'I joined in with the Haka because I think it's nice to show the human side of the police. 'The safety of the public is paramount at all times of course but it was nice to have the opportunity to enjoy with the fans, especially those from overseas. 'I just hope that the New Zealand fans in particular will see that South Wales Police officers are positive and professional but there's a human side to all of us too.' PC Green, who gave up rugby as a schoolboy 'due to a massive lack of talent', said he knew the moves from watching All Blacks' matches on television. '[New Zealand are] the best team in the world so I've watched them do the Haka on the TV so many times. I like to think they'll be pretty impressed with my moves. I did go a bit wrong at one point but I'm sure they won't mind. 'To be honest I'm waiting for Strictly [Come Dancing] to come knocking on my door now.' Bobby on the beat: PC Green said he enjoys watching rugby but stopped playing as a schoolboy because of 'a massive lack of talent' The officer, a member of South Wales Police's Serious Collision Investigation Unit, in  Swansea, was drafted in to help police Cardiff city centre after more than 70,000 rugby fans descended on the Welsh capital for the Autumn International match. 'When we're drafted in for football or rugby matches it's our opportunity to get out and meet the public, which is something I really enjoy and something that's important to me. 'I joined the force 19-and-a-half years ago to protect the public and being with them out on the streets is part of this role. 'There's nothing quite like 70,000-plus fans all there to watch a game of rugby between two of the best teams in the world - everyone is there for a good time and to enjoy themselves and it's great to be a part of that.' The All Blacks perform the Haka before the match against Wales on Saturday at the Millennium Stadium . By the time PC Green finished his shift, his colleagues had already pinned a note to the door of his office reading 'PC Sonny Green's Office' - a reference to New Zealand player Sonny Williams. Friends of the officer in Australia and New Zealand also got in touch after seeing the video online. The video was posted on the South Wales Police Facebook page, where dozens of people have commended the policeman for his actions. Ron Collins said: 'Well done Rob Green. You are a credit to your uniform.' Another user Howard Wilkins added: 'We need more coppers like him - well done PC Rob Green!'","Video of a Welsh police officer performing the Haka goes viral online .

"A trainee accountant says her £30,000 collection of ultra-realistic 'reborn dolls' has made it impossible for her to find a boyfriend. Victoria Andrews, 22, from Newbury in Berkshire, has been obsessed with the dolls, each of which costs £800, since she was a teenager. Miss Andrews, whose interest was first piqued when she stumbled across a website dedicated to the dolls at 16, has now amassed a collection worth £30,000 which includes 51 dolls, 100 outfits and several carrying baskets. Scroll down for video . Passion: Victoria Andrews, 22, from Newbury, says she can't get a boyfriend because of her doll collection . 'Sometimes I take one of them to work with me, where men find them scary,' she explained. 'Women seem not to mind so much.' Not only do men find the dolls creepy, they have also proved a source of friction between Miss Andrews and her boyfriends - many of whom have complained about them. 'The boyfriends I’ve had often complain about them,' she said. 'They hate it when I take them out with us - I think they find it all a bit creepy. My dolls give me all the fun of having kids but with no responsibility.' Reborn dolls have become increasingly popular in recent years and are designed to resemble a human baby as closely as possible. Few collectors, however, own as many as Miss Andrews. 'I always liked playing with dolls. I stumbled across reborn dolls online and I thought they were really cute. Hobby: Miss Andrews has amassed a collection of 51 dolls and has spent £30,000 so far . Lifelike: Reborn dolls are designed to resemble a human baby as closely as they possibly can . Embarrassing: Miss Andrews says ex-boyfriends were cross when she took the dolls out in public . 'The first one I bought was called Charlotte - I paid £250 for her. Once I had one I had to have more. They are adorable. It’s impossible not to love them. 'As an adult I’ve sacrificed my social life and love life for them - but I know they’re worth it.' Miss Andrews, an accountancy student, funds her reborn doll collection by spending every evening working in a local pub. The cheapest doll in her collection is worth £100. The most expensive doll, a blonde-haired and blue-eyed cherub named Chantelle, cost her £825. 'It’s a lot of money but, as far as I’m concerned, it’s money well spent,' said their owner. 'The dolls make me happy. 'I get anxious when I’m not with them and I can’t wait to get home from work so I can relax with them. 'At the moment I have no plans to stop buying the dolls. But maybe in the future I’ll sell some of the more expensive ones to help me get together a deposit for a house.' Miss Andrews lives at home with her parents to save on rent and buys all her clothes from charity shops. She has sacrificed her social life, preferring to spend money on her dolls rather than going out to meet men. 'A night out could cost me up to £100 - I might as well stay at home and save my money to buy another doll,' she explained. 'I often stay home and brush their hair or change their outfits. Occasionally I will pick one up for a cuddle. It can be very comforting at the end of a hectic day. 'I usually bring one out and about with me when I run errands. I like to spend time with each one particularly if they are new and we’re still getting to know each other. Women love them but the men who see them often find them scary for some reason.' But while women are impressed, her vast collection, which fills her bedroom shelves, has put off potential suitors. Collection: As well as 51 dolls, Miss Andrews also owns 100 different outfits and several baby carriers . Undecided: Despite owning so many dolls, Miss Andrews says she hasn't decided if she wants real babies . 'My first boyfriend was fine with them. He used to buy dolls for me and he would help me change their clothes. 'The next boyfriend I had kept moaning about them. He said I spent too much money on them. At the moment I’m single. 'Whenever I meet a guy I try and warn them about the dolls. I usually drop it into the conversation as if it’s no big deal.' Despite her obsession Miss Andrews said she does not want a real baby any time soon. 'I have a lot of kids in my family so I get to spend a lot of time with children - but I’m glad I get to give them back at the end of the day. 'I haven’t even decided if I want to have kids at all. I’m still young.'","Victoria Andrews, 22, says she is unable to get a boyfriend .

"A pregnant woman is now blind in her left eye after being hit by glass that shattered when police in Ferguson, Missouri, tackling Michael Brown protesters, shot at the window of the car she was in. Dornella Conner says she was at a gas station in the St Louis suburb in a car being driven by her boyfriend when an officer fired a non-lethal ‘bean bag’ round at them as they tried to drive away, showering her with glass. Conner has lost sight in her left eye and has blurry vision in the other following the incident on Tuesday at New Halls Ferry Road. Scroll down for video . Dornella Conner says she was at a gas station in the St Louis suburb in a car being driven by her boyfriend when an officer fired a non-lethal ‘bean bag’ round at them as they tried to drive away, showering her with glass . Police, who were responding to reports of gunshots in the area, said that the officer fired at the car because it was being driven towards him and he feared for his safety – but Conner claims that he had no need to use a weapon on them. She told Kmov.com: ‘I didn’t have any weapons, I wasn’t looting or anything. I was just out with my boyfriend. We was just riding around respecting Mike Brown.’ Conner told the news channel that several police vehicles had blocked their exit from the gas station ‘from the side and the back’. Conner has lost sight in her left eye and has blurry vision in the other following the incident on Tuesday at New Halls Ferry Road . A non-lethal bean-bag round . A bean-bag round, or flexible baton round, is a projectile used by law enforcement officers to incapacitate suspects without killing them. They are fired from a shotgun and take the form of lead shots housed in a small 'pillow'. They are designed not to penetrate skin, but are capable of causing muscle spasms. Deaths from bean bag rounds are rare. They have killed people in the past by causing internal bleeding, breaking the neck and even fatally damaging the heart by sending pieces of broken rib into it. Shotguns with bean-bag rounds are normally colored bright orange to prevent lethal rounds being loaded. Conner’s father, Donnell, said he was ‘very disappointed at police tactics’. He added: ‘There was no reason to fire upon an innocent person who was sitting in a vehicle.’ Her sister, who goes by the name Tikal Goldie, said: ‘I really just want to have closure and justice for my sister.’ Meanwhile, dozens of people have interrupted holiday shopping at major retail stores around the St. Louis area to speak out about a grand jury's decision not to indict the officer who fatally shot Michael Brown. The protests began Thanksgiving night and continued early Friday. Protesters spent a few minutes at each store, shouting inside as law enforcement stood watch. There was no immediate word of any arrests. According to Johnetta Elzie, who had been tweeting and posting videos of the protests, demonstrations occurred at a Wal-Mart and Target in Brentwood, two Wal-Marts in St. Charles and one Wal-Mart in Manchester. In Ferguson, where Brown was shot on August 9, it was a quiet holiday night. There were no visible protests as the National Guard patrolled the area. Earlier thousands of Walmart employees threatened to walk out from stores across the country on the biggest shopping day of the year. Days after a grand jury decided not to charge officer Darren Wilson, demonstrators have led a campaign not to visit stores the day after Thanksgiving. The group has used hashtags on social media such as #HandsUpDon'tSpend, in reference to the death of the teen in August, and #BlackOutBlackFriday. Some demonstrators showed up outside Macy's in New York as crowds gathered to get an early jump on the sales. Others in Ferguson walked through a Target store with their hands up, as unrest continued followed the controversial decision earlier this week.

"A military policeman has been praised by the legendary Scottish author Irvine Welsh after tattooing his quotes and characters onto his legs. Joe Stanton, 21, had lines from the novels Trainspotting and Filth inked on his skin, along with a depiction of Ewan McGregor’s character Renton in the 1996 film version of Trainspotting. He said he fell in love with the author's work after seeing the hit film, which exposes the brutality and humanity of a group of heroin addicts in Edinburgh. Superfan: Joe Stanton, right, had two quotes from Irvine Welsh's novels Filth and Trainspotting tattooed on his leg. One reads: 'Better to live life as enjoyable and complete an experience as possible, in case death is s***e' Spitting image: Another of Mr Stanton's tattoos mimics the pose of Ewan McGregor, who played heroin addict Renton in the film version of Trainspotting, in official posters. The film propelled Irvine Welsh to cult status . The soldier, who is from Nottingham and based in Aldershot, said: 'I first saw Trainspotting a few years ago and I absolutely loved it, how it was shot, the story and just how different it was alongside other films, including the story. 'Then more recently I read the book and really enjoyed it. 'As soon as I saw Filth was being released and it was written by Irvine Welsh I wanted to see it. 'I went on to read that book, then Porno and now I’m starting his other book called Skagboys. 'I’m a massive fan due to the style of how he writes his books and the darkness of some of the stories is brilliant. 'Filth was amazing as it appealed to me due to the fact that I do military police work, albeit that shows slightly different methods of policing.' Made into a film last year starring James McAvoy and Jamie Bell, Filth tells the story of a corrupt, sexist, homophobic, cocaine-snorting policeman who struggles to balance his drug habit with tackling Edinburgh's violent gangs. Inked: Mr Stanton also has Green Day lyrics inked on his skin and the same angel tattoo as David Beckham . Unflinching: Irvine Welsh (left) created deeply troubled, love-to-hate characters like corrupt policeman Bruce Robertson in Filth, who was played by James McAvoy (right) in last year's film adaptation . Mr Stanton's quotes tattoo begins with a line from Filth: 'You can only live in the world you ken [know], the rest is just wishful thinking or paranoia.' It ends with a line from Trainspotting: 'Better to live life as enjoyable and complete an experience as possible, in case death is s***e, which I suspect it will be.' The soldier paid £100 for the quotes tattoo, which he then photographed and tweeted to the legendary author. Mr Welsh retweeted the photo to his 114,000 followers, saying: 'Pretty amazing work there mate!' Mr Stanton said: 'I am absolutely buzzing that he replied.' He added: 'My girlfriend loves all my tattoos but my parents not so much. 'They didn’t really mind when it was all the family related stuff but when I started getting different ones done then that changed. Hero: Soldier Joe Stanton (right) had a personal congratulation from Irvine Welsh on Twitter (left) 'However, my mum has admitted she loves these quotes and has said that she thought they were quite funny. 'I’ll definitely be getting more done.' The Red Cap, who has been in the Army since he was 19, had his first tattoo a month before joining up in memory of his late grandfather. He added: 'It started with the David Beckham angel one and I also got some quotes from the band Green Day on my back.' Born and raised in Edinburgh, Irvine Welsh is now recognised as one of Britain's most successful authors. When Trainspotting was published in 1993, it allegedly failed to make the Booker Prize shortlist because its unflinching depictions of drugs and sex offended the sensibilities of two female judges.","Soldier Joe Stanton, 21, also has an angel tattoo and Green Day quotes .

"A town has voted not to fly the flag of St George in case it offends Muslims. Radstock in Somerset has a population of 5,620, 16 of them Muslim, census data shows. But a Labour councillor said the red and white cross could upset people because of its links to the Crusades. Eleanor Jackson, a university lecturer, said: ‘My big problem is it is offensive to some Muslims, but even more that it has been hijacked by the far Right.’ Left bare: The new flagpole in Radstock, Somerset, which has nothing on it because the council deemed the St George's flag insensitive to Muslims . The council agreed with her proposal . not to buy a St George’s flag for the town’s repaired flagpole. A Union . Flag will be flown on Armistice Day and there are plans for a flag to be . designed for Radstock. Chairman Lesley Mansell said: ‘We do . not have a Union Jack and the discussion was about purchasing one to fly . mainly for Armistice Day. ‘The council confirmed its original decision to purchase a Union Jack.’ John Clements, of patriotic group the . Royal Society of St George, condemned the council’s decision for . ‘censoring’ the national flag, and playing into the hands of the far . Right. Rizwan Ahmed, spokesman for the . Bristol Muslim Cultural Society, said: ‘To say that  Muslims are . offended I don’t think is correct. Decision: Radstock Town Council's offices in Somerset. Officials agreed with the proposal of Labour councillor Eleanor Jackson not to buy a new St George's flag for the town's repaired civic flagpole . ‘We understand the flag is part of this country’s heritage, and in fact many Muslims  identify as being British.’ Radstock resident Irene Burchell, 76, . said: ‘The council does not speak for the people of Radstock, and it . certainly doesn’t speak for me. ‘I think it is absolute nonsense. The St George’s flag has been adopted by England for centuries.’ Concerns: Labour councillor Eleanor Jackson insisted the flag could still cause upset to Muslims . The rainbow flag of the lesbian, gay, . bisexual, and transgender pride movement will also be raised at . ‘appropriate’ times of the year. The . council will also be flying the In Bloom flag at the Miners’ Memorial . Garden to celebrate the town’s gardening achievements - and there are . plans for a specially-designed flag for Radstock. Muslim Council of Britain spokesman Nasima Begum said her group encouraged the flying of the St George’s flag. She said: ‘St George needs to take his rightful place as a national symbol of inclusivity rather than a symbol of hatred. 'St George actually lived before the birth of Islam and should not be associated with any hatred of Muslims.’ And Rizwan Ahmed added: ‘It is political correctness going a bit too far. 'Use by the far right is one thing, but to say that Muslims are offended I don’t think is correct.' St George's flag: The ban on the red and white emblem (file picture) was imposed in Radstock, Somerset . The Crusades was a centuries-long series of military campaigns waged by Christians from Europe. St George became an English hero during the crusades against the Muslim armies that captured Jerusalem in the 11th century. An apparition of George is said to have appeared to the crusader army at the Battle of Antioch in 1098. His dragon-slaying legend is thought to have begun as an allegory of Diocletian's persecution of Christians. ‘I think if anything this will harm . understanding of Muslim people, and it feeds into the ideas that some . people have of “Oh, here they go again, pandering to the needs of Muslim . people”, when actually it is not offensive. ‘I can see why they have done this, but it really is too far. 'They are being overly sensitive, and making assumptions about what Muslims will be offended by. ‘In actual fact we are normal people. 'We have a sense of humour and have the same concerns as everyone else - we are not just some single group.’ There is no mosque or prayer centre in Radstock, meaning the few members of the Muslim community are forced to go to Bristol or nearby Bath in order to pray.","Ban by Radstock Town Council in Somerset after councillor's proposal .

"Youngsters in Iraq are being stoned to death for having haircuts and wearing clothes that emulate the ‘emo’ style popular among western teenagers. At least 14 youths have been killed in the capital Baghdad in the past three weeks in what appears to be a campaign by Shia militants. Militants in Shia neighbourhoods, where the stonings have taken place, circulated lists yesterday naming more youths targeted to be killed if they do not change the way they dress. Iraqi activists said this unnamed teenager was brutally killed by religious police for having an 'emo' hairstyle . The killings have taken place since Iraq’s interior ministry drew attention to the ‘emo’ subculture last month, labelling it ‘Satanism’ and ordering the community police force to stamp it out. Fans of the ‘emo’ trend – short for emotional – wear tight jeans and have distinctive long, black or spiky haircuts. The bodies of at least 14 youths have been taken to three hospitals in eastern Baghdad bearing signs of having been beaten to death with rocks. After reports of the stonings circulated on Iraqi media, the interior ministry said this week that no murders on its files could be blamed on attacks on ‘emos’. Religious extremists have been harassing and killing teenagers with 'strange' or 'emo' appearances . Iraq’s leading Shia clerics have condemned the stonings. Iraq's Moral Police released a statement on the interior ministry's website condemning the 'emo phenomenon' among Iraqi youth, declaring its intent to 'eliminate' the trend. The move is part of a wider clampdown on young people taking on what government officials call 'Western appearances' in Iraq. 'The Emo phenomenon or devil worshipping . is being followed by the Moral Police who have the approval to . eliminate (the phenomenon) as soon as possible since it's detrimentally . affecting the society and becoming a danger,' the statement read. 'They wear strange, tight clothes . that have pictures on them such as skulls and use stationary that are . shaped as skulls. They also wear rings on their noses and tongues, and . do other strange activities.' A group of armed men dressed in . civilian clothing led dozens of teenagers to secluded areas a few days . ago, stoned them to death, and then disposed their bodies in garbage . dumpsters across the capital, according to activists, activists told the Cairo-based al-Akhbar website. The armed men are said to belong to 'one of the most extremist religious groups' in Iraq. 'First they throw concrete blocks at the boy's arms, then at his legs, then the final blow is to his head, and if he is not dead then, they start all over again,' one person who managed to escape told Al-Akhbar. Iraq's moral police was granted approval by the Ministry of Education to enter Baghdad schools and pinpoint students with such appearances, according to the interior ministry's statement. The exact death toll remains unclear, but Hana al-Bayaty of Brussels Tribunal, an NGO dealing with Iraqi issues, said the current figure ranges 'between 90 and 100.' 'What's most disturbing about this is that they're so young,' she said. This 'emo' youth was one of nearly 100 who were targeted for having a western hairstyle or wearing 'American jeans' Al-Bayaty said the killings appear to have been carried out by extremist Shia militias in mostly poor Shia neighborhoods and said she suspected 'there's complicity of the Ministry of Interior in the killings.' Photos of the victims were released on Facebook, causing panic and fear among Iraqi students. Described as both a cult and sect, it’s name derives from the word ‘emotional’ Its teen followers dress in black, favouring tight jeans, T-shirts, studded belts and sneakers or skater shoes. Hair is often dyed black and straightened, and worn in a long fringe brushed to one side of the face. Music also plays a critical role, Emos like guitar-based rock with emotional lyrics – bands such as My Chemical Romance, Jimmy Eat World, and Dashboard Confessional are particular favourites. They regard themselves as a cool, young sub-set of the Goths. With the trend comes accusations of self-harming and suicide – something its followers strongly deny. A young man with long hair was among those fearful at the  government-ordained harassment of teenagers with Western appearances. 'I have long hair but that doesn't mean I'm an Emo. I'm not less of a man if I have long hair. Let's not say that if I have long hair, I'm a homosexual, but I have long hair because this is my style, this is me,' he told Iraq's Al-Sharqiya television network. Safiyyah al-Suhail, an MP, said on Thursday that 'some students have been recently arrested because they were wearing American jeans or had Western haircuts.' The interior ministry has not disclosed the number of teenage victims, but released a follow-up statement on Thursday warning extremists 'not to step on public freedom of Iraqis.' News of the gruesome deaths drew a stern reaction from Iraq's prominent Shia cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, who criticised the stoning of the young men as 'an act of terrorism.' He added: 'The Ministry of Interior took this situation very seriously and received an approval from the Ministry of Education to set a plan under my full supervision and to allow us to enter schools in the capital.' 'There are some cases of the spread of this phenomenon specifically among schools in Baghdad, but we are facing great difficulty in the lack of women on the force who would allow us to carry the investigation more accurately since the phenomenon is more popular among girls between the ages of 14 and 18.'","Number of deaths could be even higher .

"Andrew Mitchell had a second run-in with police in Downing Street, it emerged yesterday. Just 12 hours after launching a foul-mouthed rant at officers who would not let him cycle through the main gates, the Tory Chief Whip returned the next morning and demanded to be let through again. The revelation came as David Cameron risked enraging police by saying he believed Mr Mitchell’s account – given to him in a face to face meeting with the Chief Whip on Friday – that he had not called the police ‘plebs’. In doing so, Mr Cameron is effectively branding members of his own protection team liars. Scroll down for video . On his bike: Just 12 hours after launching a foul-mouthed rant at officers in Westminster, Tory Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell returned the next morning and demanded to be let through again (file picture) Police will soon have to let Mr Mitchell in through the main gates of Downing Street – because he has demanded a chauffeur-driven ministerial Jaguar. He was horrified when he was appointed Tory Chief Whip two weeks ago and told he would not get a car. He told civil servants that he must have a dedicated vehicle for himself and his fellow whips. But while most ministers use an eco-friendly Toyota Prius, Mr Mitchell has insisted on a gas- guzzling Jag for the 200-yard trip between Downing Street and the Commons – a walk of around three minutes. The demand has staggered civil servants since whips do not have public engagements. A Cabinet Office spokesman said: ‘There have been discussions about use of a ministerial car for the whips’ office, not for his exclusive use.’ A Whitehall source said that a final decision has not been made about the model of car, but Mr Mitchell had requested a Jaguar. The Prime Minister’s decision to back Mr . Mitchell raised questions about his judgment as details emerged of the . Chief Whip’s brazen second attempt to use the gates after the initial . confrontation last Wednesday. A Whitehall source said: ‘He had another go the morning after and tried to go through the main gate but was told to use the pedestrian gate to the side. 'This time there was no altercation or unpleasantness. But it’s still unbelievable.’ To make things worse for Mr Cameron, London Mayor Boris Johnson said he was ‘very glad’ the police threatened to arrest Mr Mitchell for breach of the peace during the initial encounter. Two senior Government sources last night said Mr Mitchell would have to make a third apology for his behaviour – following a statement and a ‘car crash’ on-camera interview on Monday. ‘He won’t be made to do it, but he’s going to have to say something more,’ one official said. Colleagues expressed dismay that Mr Mitchell was not showing the level of regret that the affair merited. One said: ‘The trouble is that Andrew doesn’t appear very contrite.’ In the first detailed account of the showdown between Mr Cameron and Mr Mitchell last Friday, a source last night said Mr Mitchell had put Mr Cameron in a ‘difficult position’ by denying to his face that he had hurled the toxic insult ‘plebs’ at police after they refused to open the gates for his bicycle. Major issue: David Cameron (pictured) risked enraging police by saying he believed Mr Mitchell's account - given to him in a meeting with the Chief Whip on Friday - that he had not called the police 'plebs' ‘Andrew looked the Prime Minister in the eye and said he did not say those things,’ the source said. ‘To sack him in those circumstances would have been to call him a liar.’ Mr Cameron yesterday read the full . police account of the incident for the first time after an officer’s . statement was leaked to the press. Andrew Mitchell said he’d had a ‘long, frustrating day’ before his rant at police. Yesterday it emerged part of that day had involved a curry lunch at the upmarket Cinnamon Club in Westminster. There he ‘politely’ tucked into roasted plaice fillet with Bengali spiced crab (£9.50) and hot and sweet king prawns with basmati rice (£24). After his Downing Street confrontation he is understood to have gone for another meal, at the Carlton Club in St James’s. But although the account flatly contradicts Mr Mitchell’s version of events, a senior Government source said it would make no difference to the Prime Minister’s decision. ‘The Prime Minister was very angry about what happened and told the Chief Whip to apologise,’ the source said. ‘That apology was accepted and that should be the end of the matter.’ But the revelation that Mr Cameron sided with Mr Mitchell before hearing the full police account will raise further questions. The source insisted the Prime Minister was not accusing the police officers involved of lying, but felt there was a genuine difference of recollection about the exact words used. However, senior police officers expressed irritation that the integrity of the officers involved is in question and that Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood has refused to hold an investigation. Strong opinion: To make things worse for Mr Cameron, London Mayor Boris Johnson (pictured) said he was 'very glad' the police threatened to arrest Mr Mitchell for breach of the peace during the initial encounter . Irene Curtis, of the Police Superintendents’ Association, said: ‘This has gone beyond the words that were said. It’s an issue of integrity for the officer. By challenging the officer’s version of events he is actually challenging the officer’s integrity and for a police officer that is a really serious matter.’ 'He had another go the morning after and tried to go through the main gate but was told to use the pedestrian gate to the side. This time there was no altercation or unpleasantness. But it’s still unbelievable' Whitehall source . Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper accused Mr Cameron of trying to sweep the row under the carpet. She said: ‘It now looks like there’s a cover-up going on.’ A source denied ministers were ‘reluctant’ to speak up publicly for the Chief Whip. Instead Mr Mitchell was defended yesterday by one of  his two daughters who emerged from the family home in London to tell reporters: ‘I can tell  you one thing, my father is an honest man.’ Colleagues revealed that Mr Mitchell once told officials he was a ‘Big Swinging D***’ and insisted in his last job on being served hot drinks in a mug bearing the inscription ‘Secretary of State for International Development’. Officials at that department apparently threw a party when he left. He himself may enjoy the trappings of privilege, but Andrew Mitchell has some distinctly plebeian skeletons in his ancestral closet. It transpires that the family of the public school-educated Tory Chief Whip – who once boasted he was the fourth Mitchell to be an MP – had some humble beginnings. His grandmother on his mother’s side, Ellen M Haysey, was born in Forest Gate, East London and is listed on the 1911 census as a general servant. Servant grandmother: Andrew Mitchell has some plebeian skeletons in his ancestral closet . Mr Mitchell’s great grandmother, also called Ellen, is listed on the 1901 census as a 37-year-old charwoman from Bow, East London. And his great, great, grandfather was a labourer who changed jobs and retired as a railway guard while his great grandfather is listed in the 1891 census as a telegraph lineman. Debra Chatfield, a historian from findmypast.co.uk said: ‘The information from our archives shows that Mr Mitchell’s family history is one of blue-collar workers and humble beginnings, rather than aristocracy or inherited privilege.’ Clearly his family have come a long way. The minister and his wife Sharon have an enviable property portfolio consisting of three homes in Britain and a ski chalet in France. Their impressive town house in Islington is mortgage-free and is believed to be worth £2million. It is said to boast a magnificent  wine cellar. Mr Mitchell’s knowledge of good wine might stem from some more successful ancestors who set up the famous El Vino wine merchants in 1879. El Vino was sold in a £7million deal ten years ago, earning Mr Mitchell £630,000 for his 9 per cent stake. Mr Mitchell and his wife also own a country retreat in a Nottinghamshire village near his former constituency of Gedling where he was MP from 1987 until 1997. The property is believed to be worth around £500,000. Meanwhile the House of Commons register of members’ financial interests reveals Mr Mitchell receives a rental income ‘from time to time’ from a chalet he owns in the French ski resort of Val d’Isere. He also has a £300,000 terraced house in his Midlands constituency of Sutton Coldfield. During the MPs’ expenses scandal it was revealed he had claimed more than £12,000 for cleaning, redecorating, gardening and furnishing at  the home. It also emerged he had claimed 13p for Tippex and 45p for a stick of glue on his Parliamentary expenses.","Came just 12 hours after officers said he couldn't cycle through main gates .

"She's has her own clothing line, access to stylists and numerous designer contacts. But that doesn't mean Kim Kardashian always gets it right when it comes to her fashion choices. The reality star, 34, caused a stir when she recently stripped off for Paper magazine and it seems she can also fire debate when she has her clothes on. In a poll of women aged between 18-30, respondents were asked to identify the mother-of-one's top ten fashion fails. Scroll down for video . Her worst outfit: Kim Kardashian was compared to Mrs Doubtfire when she wore this dress by designer Riccardo Tisci to the Met Ball in 2013 when she was pregnant with her daughter, North . Not pretty in pink: A holey Chanel outfit worn during Paris Fashion Week, left, and a latex dress worn this month came second and third in the poll . Topping the list was the floral print dress created by Givenchy designer Riccardo Tisci which she wore to the Met Ball in 2013 when she was pregnant with her daughter, North. The unflattering gown was criticised for being too gaudy and looking like a set of curtains. Some even went as far as to compare Kim to the character Mrs Doubtfire thanks to the frumpy, floral number. One respondent said: 'I have to say that considering Kim Kardashian probably has so many personal stylists, she never seems to get it right. That floral dress she wore to the Met Gala was absolutely awful. 'She actually looked like the sofa I have in my living room, it's exactly the same print.' Lacey look: Kim with husband Kanye West during Paris Fashion Week in another dress paired with a gold choker necklace that failed to impress voters . Revealing: Kim's choice of outfit for this year's VMAs. She admitted her style 'has become sexier since becoming a mum' In second place was the unusual hole detail two-piece she wore at Paris Fashion Week earlier this year. Despite being designed by Chanel, respondents weren't convinced by the bizarre baby pink ensemble that was also seen on the catwalk modelled by Cara Delevingne. One person said: 'When Kim wore that weird two piece with holes in it, I genuinely thought she'd lost the plot. Who cares if Chanel designed it – it was hideous. 'It just goes to show that it's all about the brand and not the clothing itself, she is definitely just a fashion follower.' Another recent fashion faux pas was Kim's salmon pink latex bodycon dress, worn to promote her latest perfume in Australia this month. The outfit tightly clung to her famous curves creating unflattering lines and creases and pushed her cleavage up. Double denim has long been a fashion no-no so Kim was slated by voters for wearing denim jeans with a matching shirt earlier this year - with this outfit coming in fourth place in the poll. Fashion faux pas: Double denim, left, was another unpopular choice along with the Princess Jasmine style colour blocking outfit worn in 2011, right . Next was another outfit Kim chose whilst surrounded by fashionistas at Paris Fashion Week. Her choice of a white lacy maxi dress with a gold choker necklace did not make a good impression when she stepped out with her husband Kanye West. Four of the outfits which made the top ten were worn when Kim was pregnant showing she had difficulty nailing a chic maternity style. As well the floral gown, snakeskin peplum trousers and nude and monochrome dresses, all worn when she had a baby bump made the top ten. A mother who took part in the poll observed: 'Kim Kardashian does look glamorous a lot of the time, but when she was pregnant she really had no idea. When I was having a baby, I just stuck to comfy clothes that were loosely fit. 'She still tried to wear skintight clothes and shoes that made her look massive and must have been so uncomfortable.' Maternity wear: Kim failed to flatter her baby bump in a nude maxi dress, left, monochrome gown, centre, and snakeprint peplum trousers, right . In  seventh place was a clashing colour block purple and orange dress Kim wore back in 2011 for another perfume launch while also making the top ten was a garish print mini dress with a plunging neckline she wore to the VMAs this year. Although the 650 voters were asked to pick Kim's worst outfits of all time, nearly half of the most unpopular choices were worn since the reality star has become a mother. In October, she told Grazia magazine she has deliberately chosen raunchier outfits since North was born. She said: 'My style has become sexier since becoming a mum. I'm more bold. You would think that I would tone it down and wear sweats and flats all day but I don't feel good wearing that.' A spokesperson for mobileslots.com, who carried out the poll said: 'Kim Kardashian is one of the powerful celebrity names in the world. With great power comes great fashion responsibility and she is guilty of letting her fans down one too many times. 'Many of her outfit choices have been questionable to say the least, sometimes simple is more effective.'","Reality star, 34, recently stripped off for Paper magazine .

Now the clever corvids may be able to add football skills and psychic abilities to their list of accomplishments, as two trained crows have undertaken a penalty shootout to predict the winner of the World Cup.

Scientists have conducted a fun and whimsical experiment, letting crows take part in a penalty shoot-out to predict which team will win the World Cup (pictured above) The birds played penalty shootouts to predict who will win the real World Cup.

Two of their best crows, named Ricalli and Crexa were invited to strut their stuff on a miniature football pitch with little goals and crow-sized footballs. In order to make their predictions for which team will win the (real) World Cup, the crows had a penalty shootout by dropping a football down a tube to score a goal – or not. Each time the crows took a shot they got a chunk of fillet steak as a treat.

A crow scoring for Argentina is pictured . In the experiment, a crow named 007 performed a series of tasks without seeing the difficult course, make up of eight problems, beforehand. The wild crow learned to use individual props during its three months of captivity but had to work out the order in which to use them to complete the challenge and get an inaccessible treat. The animal was later released. 007 completed the eight-stage puzzle in just two-and-a-half minutes. First, it pulled a string attached to the branch it perched on towards itself to reach a short stick dangling below. The crow picked up the short stick in its mouth to complete stage one. 007 then immediately made its way to a narrow container containing a meaty treat and tried to use the stick to reach it – but it was too short. In the final show down between Argentina and Germany, the crows predicted that the South American  team will lift the famous golden trophy. Argentina's winning goal is pictured in the crow World Cup final . Dr Alex Taylor, a lecturer in evolutionary psychology at the University of Auckland, set up the football matches. He has already shown that crows can solve one of the most complex tests of the animal mind ever to be constructed (illustrated) - and can do so in less than three minutes on camera - a world first . An experiment by the University of Cambridge has proved that members of the crow family, known as corvids, aren’t just among the cleverest birds, they are smarter than most mammals and can perform tasks that three and four-year-old children have difficulty with. Scientists said that, while having very different brain structures, both crows and primates use a combination of mental tools, including imagination and the anticipation of possible future events, to solve similar problems. Other experiments involving the same family of birds found that Caledonian crows can use up to three tools in sequence to obtain food, which the University of Oxford’s Behavioural Ecology Research Group said is the first demonstration of spontaneous sequential tool use in a species other than humans. A study also found that rooks can use stones to raise the level of water in a vessel in order to bring a floating worm into reach. Urban-living carrion crows have been witnessed learning to use road traffic for cracking nuts. The bird kept hold of the stick and made . its way to the first of three boxes, which each contained a stone . unreachable without the stick behind wooden bars. 007 then used its stick to drag a stone from the first box and picked it up in its beak to complete stage two. But then it dropped the stone, seemingly temporarily stumped as what to do with it. However, the persistent creature picked up the stick again and retrieved a stone from the second of the boxes and then seemingly has a brainwave to place it in a separate perspex container. 007 picked up the stone it has already retrieved and posted it into the clear container too, before retrieving the final stone from the final box. When it posted the last of the stones into the perspex box, their weight pushed down a compartment, which allowed the crow to access a long stick and complete stage eight. Armed with the long stick, the crow immediately used it to poke inside a narrow box treat containing a treat and dragged the morsel towards itself. The clever bird was rewarded for its hard work and mental agility in completing the series of eight challenges. The winning crow footballer is pictured with a miniature World Cup.

One user realised it was fake from the sound quality.

"A disturbing video uploaded by a self-confessed Kim Kardashian wannabe has urged her female fans to stay with their boyfriends even if they 'hit or beat you up'. Romina Garcia, who has more than 100,000 Facebook followers, posted the video online where she openly supports domestic violence in a relationship. The 18-year from Nevada, Las Vegas, said that not many boyfriends 'care enough' to beat their girlfriends but those are 'willing' to do so are 'amazing'. Scroll down for video . In the video uploaded to Facebook, Romina Garcia urges girls to stay with their abusive boyfriends . Ms Garcia, an 18-year-old from Nevada in Las Vegas, has more than 100,000 'followers' on Facebook . In the clip that has attracted 375,000 views on Facebook, Ms Garcia tells her allegiance of fans: 'I just wanted to say that if your boyfriend or the guy that you're with puts his hands on you, like he hits you or beats you up or whatever he does, stay with him. That n***** f****** loves you because he's risking for you to press charges on him, he is risking for you know, you calling the police or you know, he - he's gonna do time or he's gonna have to pay money to get out of jail or whatever the case may be. He's risking all of that for you.' She goes on to say that girls should 'appreciate' boyfriends who are prepared to hit their other half. She then discusses her own experience of being beaten by her boyfriend. 'The other day my boyfriend gave me a black-eye, it was my fault, like, he didn't mean - I mean he, he - he was going to hit me but like I moved, so he got my eye. 'After I realised how stupid I was, how I could have avoided everything, I got on my knees and I begged him like please ""do not leave me"", like, I am so sorry for what I, you know, for what I did. 'Like, you gave me an order and I didn't follow it and now I know not to disrespect you, not to talk back, if he gives me an order to follow it.' She then posted a follow-up picture with the caption: 'Give me a black eye so I know it's real'. But two days later she wrote on Facebook: 'I'm single. My n***** abuse wasn't harsh enough. The next n***** I'm with better put me in hospital from all his tough love, so I know it's real!!!' The video was met with much criticism online with this user telling Ms Garcia that she 'got all mixed up' The shocking video promoting violence in a relationship was met with outrage online. Chandelle Fraser wrote: 'No, if a guy hits you and beats you that means he thinks you are just a peace of s***. 'A guy that really loves you would not punch you. He would kiss you instead of hitting you.' Another, Essence Thompson said: 'There are no words to explain (this). And quite frankly, I don't care what you've got going on in your personal ""love"" life. 'The reason I'm upset is because you're giving this kind of advice to young girls. Girls who follow and look up to you (for some odd reason). You need to stop this. Seriously. It's not funny, not cute, and not right. Just stop.' Others criticised her for craving attention, labelling her a 'moron', 'dumb' and 'stupid'. Geri Burnikell from Support Line told MailOnline: 'This is quite shocking and obviously if you are in a relationship and you love someone, then you don't abuse them. 'Many of the people she is targeting are young and impressionable and this gives them a distorted image of what a healthy relationship should be. I don't understand why she would promote this. 'We help people who have been in an abusive relationship and years and years later it can still have an affect on them, on their self-esteem and their confidence. 'It can make them wary of trusting men and going into another relationship in the future and they can start self-harming or develop an eating disorder. People need to know that this isn't normal in a relationship.' The 18-year-old looks up to Kim Kardashian as 'she's really rich and famous' and 'she's really pretty' She received messages of support from her allegiance of fans who said they 'looked up' to her . Another user said that her Dad hit her 'but her cares for me and loves me' to which Ms Garcia replied 'yes it does teach you a lot like how to handle a situation and not be a baby about it' But the 18-year-old did receive some praise for the video. One Facebook user said: 'I look up to you girl. You tell how it is. Seriously my man broke my jaw (and) we're still together. It made us closer I swear, after that it put me in my place.' Ms Garcia replied to her fan saying: 'Swear. Good for him. These hoes out there just don't know where they belong. I salute him.' In response to the controversial video, Ms Garcia said: 'It's my opinion. If I had a daughter and she gave her boyfriend a good enough reason to hit her, I would think that was OK. 'A good enough reason for him to hit her would be her disrespecting him, or talking back or not doing something that he asked her to do. 'I don't ask people to share or view my video. They just do.' And she said she was unperturbed about the negative reaction to the video. 'I don't pay attention to it. I get messages, like really negative messages since I made that video. But I don't give time to it.' Ms Garcia hopes her new-found fame will help her emulate role model, Kim Kardashian. She said: 'I love Kim Kardashian. She's my role model. Look at her now, she's really rich and famous. She's a good role model. She's just really pretty.' The full transcript of the shocking video uploaded by Romina Garcia on her Facebook page. Okay you guys, I wanted to address something, mainly with you girls, about your boyfriend or the guy you're talking to and I just wanted to say that if your boyfriend or the guy that you're with puts his hands on you like he hits you or beats you up or whatever he does.

So that n***** f****** loves you! And you need to get on your f****** knees and just pray and hope that he doesn't give you another black-eye or he doesn't kill you. Because honestly, like, a guy that's willing to do that for a girl, it's - I mean, it's amazing, like, not many guys you have out there care enough for the girls to do that. But the guys that do that they're the real like the real ass n***** and you - you girls need to appreciate it. And you know the other day my boyfriend gave me a black-eye, it was my fault, like, he didn't mean - I mean he, he - he was going to hit me but like I moved, so he got my eye. 'Like, he hit me in my eye whatever, he gave me a black-eye. But I'm wearing make-up right now so you can't tell but it's on this eye. I was going to go out somewhere today so he took me to get my make-up done because he didn't want people seeing me with him, you know, because I had a black-eye, they were gonna be like ""what f***"", you know. 'Or whatever, he just didn't like that or whatever. So I went to go get my makeup done but the fact that he put his hands on me means a lot to me because that shows me how he cares. 'And as you asked like he hit me, like, after I realized how stupid I was, how I could have avoided everything, I got on my knees and I begged him like please ""do not leave me"", like, I am so sorry for what I, you know, for what I did. 'Like, you gave me an order and I didn't follow it and now I know not to disrespect you, not to talk back, if he gives me an order to follow it and I know you b*****s are gonna be like, well where's your proof, well you know well my proof of like my black-eye, I took a picture of it, it's on my Instagram and my Instagram is romina-kdashian so you can always follow me on there.

"Model mother Lara Stone, 30, has been unveiled as the face of Versace's new perfume, Eros Pour Femme. Resplendent in a  Grecian-style dress, the mother-of-one looks stunning in the picture  released by the fashion house to promote their  goddess-inspired fragrance. The new campaign is the latest in a series of big name tie-ups for Lara, who has also starred in adverts for Calvin Klein and DKNY among others. Scroll down for video . Divine look: Model Lara stone is the new face of Versace's Eros Pour Femme Perfume . Vice president of the Versace group, Donatella Versace, said of the perfume: 'Eros Pour Femme is the ultimate in power and seduction from Versace. From the captivating fragrance to the elegance of the bottle and the stunning campaign by Mert Alas & Marcus Piggott starring Lara Stone.' According to Donatella the perfume is designed to capture the primal power of a woman, with Lara being their ideal femme fatale. The bottle's gold design shows the Medusa head which is synonymous with Versace brand. This is not Lara's first fragrance campaign. In July the model's famous pout took centre stage in a new advert for Stella McCartney's signature fragrance, STELLA. At the time Stella revealed that there was no other model she would have chosen: 'STELLA is a celebration of women, and Lara is the perfect representation,' she said. 'She brings the ideas of the fragrance alive, in an honest way, she is a modern woman who is approachable and sensual at the same time.' Gleaming gold: The bottle features the Medusa head which is seen in a lot of Versace's designs . Bold and beautiful: Earlier this year Lara fronted the new STELLA perfume campaign with McCartney saying she couldn't have used any other model . Famous pout: Lara's world famous pout featured in the advert as she clutched a minature perfume bottle between her teeth . Lara, who is married to comedian David Walliams, recently caused a stir when she took part in a completely unedited shoot for System magazine. In the beautiful images, shot by the world famous Juergen Teller, a nearly naked Lara is seen showing off her post baby body. The model has previously made no bones about the fact that her body has changed since giving birth to her son Alfred in May 2013. She said in an interview with The Edit earlier this year: 'Everyone's got arm flab or saggy boobs. It's the way it is. I'm just trying to accept it right now. And it's OK, because the things women can do with their bodies are amazing.' She admitted that, like many new mothers, she struggled to lose her baby weight. 'I'd never had to lose a significant amount of weight. I found it quiet stressful; this huge mountain of weight to lose,' she said. But her friend and trainer, Bodyism founder James Duigan helped her to see things in perspective: '[James] showed me that it wasn't really about that and it was about being a mother and having this beautiful baby.' Amazing figure: Although Lara admitted to finding loosing her baby weight stressful she seemed happy and comfortable as she attended the Fashion Rocks event in New York in September . Mr Teller said of the unretouched shoot: 'I'm often asked the question: 'What is beauty for you?' But I don't really think in those terms. I just find a lot of things beautiful when you open your mind.' Lara and David first got together in 2009, announcing their engagement in 2010. Following their marriage, which took place in London's Claridge's hotel, the pair revealed in December 2012 that they were expecting their first child with Alfred being born the next year. Following his first birthday Lara described how emotional she found it to watch her little boy growing up. 'On his (Alfred's) birthday, I cried the whole day,' she said, 'When they're born and just a helpless little blob laid on your chest, they're so vulnerable and little. And now he's this huge monster - in the loveliest way. 'He doesn't really say words, but he can make himself understood. He's very strong minded and he knows exactly what he wants to do, and if it's not right he'll have a huge tantrum. 'He's completely hilarious – this little boy, stamping his little foot.' Lovely couple: Earlier this year Lara attended the GQ Men of The Year Awards with her husband comedian David Walliams, the pair first got together in 2009 .","The 30-year-old model looks resplendent in white gown .

"While shoppers across the country swarm stores to get their hands on cut-price electronics, the residents of Colorado are lining blocks to score deals on weed - in what retailers have dubbed 'Green Friday'. Many marijuana dispensaries across the state - where recreational weed was legalized in January - are employing tactics more often seen during 'Black Friday'. Among the deals were $50 ounces of marijuana that usually cost $250, USA Today reported, while another store  was selling Sweetgrass Kitchen's single-serving pumpkin pies laced with weed. Grass Station in Denver sold 60 joints for $1 each - instead of the usual $7 - to the first people through the door on Friday morning, when lines queued around the block. Scroll down for video . High there: Customers line up for 'Green Friday' deals at the Grass Station marijuana shop on Black Friday in Denver, Colorado. It marks the first Black Friday since marijuana was legalized in the state in January . In demand: Customers line up for 'Green Friday' deals at the Grass Station marijuana shop . Owners said they were surprised by the interest in deals, expecting that customers would visit their stores after snagging deals at more traditional retailers. 'We were expecting a very quiet day, but when everyone else jumped on it, we definitely didn't want to be left behind,' Ryan Pratt, manager of Boulder's Helping Hands Herbals, told USA Today. But others said they understood the need for marijuana over the Thanksgiving weekend. 'It's a pretty stressful event, and some people might need a little relaxation afterward,' said Maka Kala'i of Organic Alternatives in Fort Collins. John Satterfield, a distribution worker at Denver's Kindman Premium Cannabis, told Slate that some of their discounts would be for 80 or 90 per cent off, while others would be reserved for the first handful of customers through the door. Stress reliever: Owners said they weren't surprised customers wanted help to get through the busy weekend . New ploy: An employee looks at an ad for 'Green Friday' deals at the Grass Station marijuana shop . Bargain: Some stores are giving as much as 80 or 90 per cent off marijuana products on 'Green Friday' Choice: Customers shop for deals at the Grass Station weed shop - just one of many open in the state today . The Dixie Elixir Marijuana Company in Denver is also preparing holiday specials, including white chocolate peppermint squares, while another dispensary is selling pot in the shape of mini Christmas trees, CBS reported. Since it became legalized on January 1, marijuana has generated more than $50 million in taxes and fees for the state. But - unlike traditional retailers - the dispensaries did not advertize their 'Green Friday' deals on TV or billboards because of strict regulations to ensure marijuana is not marketed to anyone under 21. Some critics were not happy about the retailers' new ploy to get customers through the door. 'Dumping high levels of THC into pumpkin pies, sweet potatoes, hot chocolate and marshmallows, it is just perpetuating this false myth that marijuana is not dangerous,' Diane Carlson, co-founder of anti-legalization campaign group Smart Colorado, told USA Today.","Shoppers today lined up for deals on marijuana in Colorado, which legalized recreational weed in January ."

"Have you ever imagined sitting through a church service while munching on a Big Mac meal? Well, a campaign group now hopes to make the idea a reality by introducing McDonald's in to the church. The 'McMass' group believes more people would visit church if they could combine their communion wafer and red wine with a burger and fries. Scroll down for video . The McMass group wants to build McDonald's in churches as a way to 'capture modern audiences' The group, led by Paul Di Lucca, a creative director at the church branding agency Lux Dei design, want to raise $1million to build the first McDonald's church. They have set up a page on the IndieGoGo fundraising site, but have so far received just $104 in donations. Mr Di Lucca said it was time for Christianity to 'capture modern audiences' and saw the 'iconic' McDonald's brand as an ideal way to do so. He conceded that some people would think his master plan 'an insane idea'. The group hopes to raise funds by selling memorabilia, including T shirts with the hashtag #Feast4Jesus . The group believes that by introducing McDonald's in to the church it will attract people and boost finances . 'It's time or churches to engage with entrepreneurship. By combining a church and a McDonald's we can create a self-sustaining, community-engaged, popular church, and an unparalleled McDonald's restaurant', he writes on the group page. He continues: 'We've all had the experience of driving through a community and seeing beautiful, old, churches that are falling into disrepair. 'Perhaps these churches suffer from low attendance, and are only used a few days a week - they may even be entirely vacant. 'Churches need to financially support themselves, bring in public traffic and to re-assert their position as gathering places. 'Church architecture is wonderful are often centrally located. However these attributes are wasted without an audience. 'We need to solve this problem soon or church communities as we know them will cease to exist. The McMass Project is helping churches keep pace in the modern world.'

Don't you remember reading the scripture about Jesus being upset with a temple for making it a place to sell and buy?' Another said: 'I’m all for innovation and doing things outside of the box but this idea is just horrific. Why not support local stores that are healthy? Ones that have things like morals and principles? Things that should accompany churches?'","'McMass' group wants to introduce the first McDonald's in to a church .

"She has walked some of the biggest catwalks in the world, is rumoured to be the new face of Chanel and has a net worth of a cool £1.9million. We're talking about Kendall Jenner, who, if the recent state of her career is anything to go by, looks set to usurp Cara Delevingne as the world's biggest supermodel in 2015. Kendall's career has been going from strength to strength over the last twelve months. Scroll down for video . Friends in competition: Cara and Kendall are close friends but in recent months it seems Kendall has been taking over Cara's career as top model . Having initially found fame on the hit TV show Keeping Up With The Kardashians, which follows the life of her glamorous family, she has been at great pains to move into the fashion world. And her hard work has been paying off. Not only did she recently land her first big beauty campaign for Estee Lauder, but it's also thought that  Karl Lagerfeld is eyeing her for his latest project. The Chanel head honcho has reportedly asked the reality TV star to feature in the ad for his Spring/Summer 2015 collection alongside fellow models Sasha Luss, Ming Xi and Baptiste Giabiconi. This is despite the fact that 22-year-old London born Cara has long been his muse. The recent models.com list of the top 50 models in the world also seemed to confirm that Kendall is  overtaking in the high fashion stakes. The list, which ranks models according to how many campaigns, front covers and followers they have, didn't even feature Ms Delevingne, but Kendall made the cut for the first time. Chanel chicks: Kendall and Cara have both previously walked for Chanel, however it is thought Kendall will take the brand's SS15 campaign . Great in Givenchy: In September, Kendall walked the Givenchy Spring/Summer 2015 show in Paris . It probably doesn't hurt that the second youngest of the Kardashian clan has a cool 33 million Instagram followers - the equivalent of over half the population of the UK. Of course, Kendall's success comes at a time when Cara has very openly decided to let her modelling work take a back seat. Over the last few months, she has started to carve a career as an actress and musician and previously described the idea of giving up modelling as, 'blissful.' She starred in the recent Amanda Knox biopic, Face of An Angel, and is currently working on a film named Paper Towns. Kendall - who recently earned a 13 page spread in the December issue of Vogue - is very much enamoured with the fashion industry though, claiming that she has worked had to get where she is today. In a recent interview, she said: 'I’m not trying to use a family name or anything. In reality I worked pretty hard for this… It wasn’t like I just got it magically and it just happened.' Moving with the times: Estee Lauder have named Kendall as their new face and asked her to announce the news via her social media accounts . She continued: 'I would always be looking at these supermodels, they were just so amazing to me, they were like superheroes. 'I want to be some little girl's superhero. I want to be the best role model I can be to a little girl or a little boy or to anybody.' Her popularity within the fashion industry is clear. Earlier this year she starred in Givenchy's A/W 2014 campaign, which was shot by renowned photographers Mert and Marcus. And over the last two seasons she has been booked for show after show. When she walked the Marc Jacobs A/W 2014 runway, she made headlines all over the world in a daring nipple-baring top. LOVE magazine editor Katie Grand - who has championed Kendall in her publication - said of the decision to cast the young star, 'When we are casting Marc Jacobs, I always try and throw in a couple of unexpected models. 'When Kendall Jenner's agent, Christopher Michael, called me and asked me to meet Kendall, I was intrigued.' It's a family affair: Kendall first found fame in Keeping Up With Kardashians, which follows the lives of her and her sisters. Here she is pictured with Khloe and Kylie at the American Music Awards last week . The new Chanel girl? Kendall, left, has already walked in the prestigious Chanel show and could well replace her friend Cara Delevingne, right, as the face of the French fashion house . There are even many similarities between the two young women, just like Cara, Kendall runs with the in crowd. From hanging out with her uber famous sisters; Kim, Khloe, Kourtney and Kylie, to kicking back with some of the most famous stars on the planet. Kendall is not only close friends with Justin Bieber, she's also been spotted hanging out with Selena Gomez and Jaden Smith. And from December of 2013 to February 2014 she dated one of the world's most eligible bachelors, Harry Styles. Being seen with the One Direction heartthrob provided an incredible boost to her fan base. Friends in high places: Kendall is friends with many stars, she's pictured here with Justin Bieber and fellow model Gigi Hadid at a party in Paris . One Direction dream: Although Kendall's romance with One Direction singer Harry Styles was short-lived it no doubt boosted her fan base . Party pals: Cara is not short of famous friends herself. Here she is pictured with Beyonce and Sir Philip Green at a dinner in New York . Although Kendall might not have been modelling for as long as Cara, she's already bringing in the big bucks. While Cara landed herself on the list of Forbes list of the highest earning models earlier this year for her £2.2million fortune, with a net worth of £1.9million Kendall isn't trailing far behind. Plus, a leaked email from one of the Kardashian clan's assistants recently suggesting that Kendall charges anywhere up to £630,000 per endorsement, so she's not even going to have to work that hard to catch up. However, if Kendall does manage to knock Cara off the top model spot, there won't be any bad blood between them. The pair have been seen hanging out on more than one occasion, even dressing up together for Halloween this year. She's so popular: Over the last twelve months Kendall has walked for some of the biggest labels in the world, from Tommy Hilfiger (left) to the Ports 1961 show (right)","Kendall's career has gone from strength to strength in 2014 .

"Gordon Ramsay arriving at the High Court today with his wife Tana. He told the court he felt like a 'performing monkey' while building his restaurant empire . Gordon Ramsay felt like a 'performing monkey' building his restaurant empire while his father-in-law had a 'cushy number in the office', the High Court has heard. Mr Ramsay was today giving evidence  as he tried to avoid being held personally liable for the annual rent on a London pub he bought when Christopher Hutcheson, the father of his wife Tana, was at the helm of his business. The celebrity chef has accused Mr Hutcheson of using a ghost writer machine, more commonly used by authors to sign books and photographs automatically, to forge his signature on a document which made him the personal guarantor for the costly £640,000 annual rent of the exclusive York & Albany pub near Regent's Park. Film director Gary Love, who owns the York & Albany, has previously described Ramsay's allegation as an 'absurd' attempt to wriggle out of his rental commitments. In the second week of the hearing, Mr Ramsay was today asked in cross-examination about emails in which he expressed his unhappiness about what was happening while Mr Hutcheson was managing his business. In court Romie Taylor QC, appearing for Mr Love, told Mr Ramsay: 'You were complaining about him. You thought of him as treating you like a performing donkey - making you overwork away from the office while he was up to no good in the office.' After listening and agreeing, the chef added that he in fact had felt like a 'performing monkey.' The judge, Mr Justice Morgan, then turned to Mr Ramsay and said: 'You were doing the donkey work. 'You were out there working day in, day out while (Mr Hutcheson) had a cushy number at the office where he was able to abstract personal funds for personal gain. Scroll down for video .

Mr Ramsay has accused his father-in-law Christopher Hutcheson, pictured, of using a ghost writer machine to forge his signature on documents that made the chef the personal guarantor for the pub's rent . 'I am not saying this is true, but this is what you are saying.' Mr Ramsay agreed with the judge saying the more he had dug into what had happened following Mr Hutcheson's sacking 'the worst it got'. The chef also faced accusations from Mr Tager that he was aware that a ghost writer capable of reproducing his signature had been used to sign documents including the York & Albany rental guarantee. Mr Tager suggested: 'You knew all along about this practice.' The York & Albany pub near Regents Park in London which is owned by film director Gary Love . But Mr Ramsay told the judge: 'That is not true, my lord.' Mr Ramsay, who owns 28 restaurants and a cookery school, first gave evidence last week and described 'his shock and horror' at discovering Mr Hutcheson, whom he deeply trusted, had defrauded him and the Ramsay group of companies out 'of hundreds of thousands of pounds'. The chef is asking the judge to grant a declaration that the rental guarantee is not binding because his signature was used without his knowledge and authorisation when the 25-year lease was signed in 2007. Gordon Ramsay Holdings (GRH) won a bidding war seven years ago to secure the 160-year-old building in the exclusive area of north London. It has since been turned into an upmarket restaurant, bar and hotel, with rooms starting at £150. Mr Hutcheson acted as business manager for the Ramsay group of companies until the chef sacked both him and wife Tana's brother, Adam, on the grounds of 'gross misconduct' in 2010. In 2012 their dispute was settled, with Mr Ramsay's wife thought to have severed all ties with her family. The case at the High Court continues.

"Former first lady Hillary Clinton is now charging more  for public speaking engagements than her husband - and has an extensive list of  demands, it has emerged. The 67-year-old reportedly charged a staggering $300,000 'special university rate' for a guest lecture at the University of California at Los Angeles on March 5, 2014. This is compared to the $250,000 her spouse and former president, Bill Clinton, requested for his appearance at the same university in 2012, it is said. Scroll down for video . Difference in price: Former first lady Hillary Clinton (right) is now charging more for speaking engagements than her husband Bill (left) - and has an extensive list of demands, according to newly released emails . As well as the high price, Mrs Clinton also reportedly insisted on the fulfillment of an array of demands, including a backstage menu featuring 'diet ginger ale, crudités, hummus and sliced fruit'. The former Secretary of  State's requests were detailed in emails exchanged between her representatives and UCLA officials, later obtained by The Washington Post. According to the emails, Mrs Clinton's representatives requested a case of still water - at room temperature - to be deposited on the stage prior to her March appearance. They also insisted 'a carafe of warm/hot water, coffee cup and saucer... water glass, and lemon wed­ges' be situated on a table on stage, as well as 'two long, rectangular pillows' on her chair, it is said.

'She doesn’t like to stand around waiting for people', a UCLA administrator said in an email, in which he relayed the concerns of the likely 2016 presidential candidate's representatives. When the university asked whether Mrs Clinton offered a reduced rate for public universities, they were reportedly told $300,000 was the 'special university rate.' Officials were surprised by the 'discounted price' following Mr Clinton's cheaper 2912 speech, with one administrator telling the newspaper: 'Wow! She gets $50K more than hubby!'. It is unknown whether Mr Clinton made a list of demands for his inaugural Luskin lecture. The correspondence, which took place over nearly a year, was obtained under a Freedom of Information Act request. According to the emails, five days before the lecture, Clinton’s team rejected the podium planned for her use. Instead, the university had to get an new one. Officials were also required to rent a new university seal to match and that the award she was to be presented with should be in a box - not draped around her neck, it is said. And they reportedly had to buy a a computer, mouse and printer, as well as a scanner,for her visit. High price: When the university asked whether Mrs Clinton (pictured with husband Bill and daughter Chelsea) offered a reduced rate for public universities, they were told $300,000 was the 'special university rate' Mrs Clinton's candidate fees have been well-documented. Earlier this year, she defended the nearly quarter-million dollar fee she charges for speaking engagements at colleges and universities after students at one university demanded that she return the fee. Mrs Clinton said that the enormous sums of money she has collected for speeches have gone towards her family's charity, The Clinton Foundation. The politician's wealth has been under scrutiny since an interview earlier this year in which she described her family as 'dead broke' and in debt when Mr Clinton left the White House in 2001. Mrs Clinton later called that description 'inartful.'

So it goes from a foundation at a university to another foundation,' she told ABC. She added that her speaking engagements are used to present 'new ideas to help strengthen the economy, which in turn, will help lower income inequality.' 'It’s been my experience,' she said, 'That they’re not worried about my speaking or my household, they’re worried about their own.

"Louis Vuitton is the go-to brand for designer handbags in almost every fashion-savvy city in America, according to new market research. Unless you happen to live in Miami or New York, that is, where Chanel is the most popular choice. In whichever city you look at, however, French-owned labels absolutely dominate the handbag market. In a survey conducted by San Francisco-based designer consignment retailer The RealReal, which analysed sales data from its top ten biggest-spending cities, five brands stood head-and-shoulders above the rest in terms of popularity: Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Gucci, Céline, Hermés and Goyard. French-tastic: Louis Vuitton is the go-to brand for designer handbags in almost every fashion-savvy city in America, followed by Chanel. Pictured (left) a $3,150 Louis Vuitton tote and (right) a $5,600 Chanel purse . The results, published by StyleList, reveal that Louis Vuitton out-performed its competition in nearly every one of the cities which sold the most designer handbags overall; Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington D.C. and Seattle. Hardly surprising, since the LVMH-owned French label was listed by Forbes as the most valuable luxury brand in the world this year; worth an eye-watering $29.9billion. Also popular: Gucci came second in Seattle, and the third in Denver and Dallas, and Céline came third in Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco. Pictured (left) a $2,450 Gucci bag and (right) a $2,120 Céline option . Runners-up: Hermés came third in Washington D.C. and Miami, and second in New York, while Goyard came in second for Denver shoppers. Pictured (left) a $4,775 Hermés bag and (right) a $1,395 Goyard purse .

Seattle, Washington: Louis Vuitton,                Gucci, Chanel . Chanel wasn't far behind on the list, coming in as the second most popular choice in Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington D.C.; and first in New York and Miami. A new quilted handbag from the current collection will set you back $5,600, but if you're after a special edition piece, you're looking at tens of thousands of dollars. Gucci, an Italian brand and the only non-French label on the popularity list, was the second choice for shoppers in Seattle, and the third in Denver and Dallas. Céline came third in three states, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco; and iconic brand Hermés came third in Washington D.C. and Miami, and second in New York. Hermés, purveyor of the iconic Birkin bag, famously sold a Himalayan crocodile variety in September for a whopping $185,000 at auction in Los Angeles - the highest price ever commanded by the Parisian brand. And you can't get your hands on a standard pre-owned Birkin for much less than $10,000. The only other designer handbag brand to be a top-three seller across the ten states was Goyard, which came in second for Denver shoppers. This lesser-known label was founded in Paris in 1853  and is known to be the oldest Parisian trunk maker still in business. You can't buy a new Goyard bag anywhere online as the brand states it 'does not engage in any e-commerce.' It is only available in select boutiques around Europe, Asia and the U.S., but a pre-owned bag costs between $1,395 and $1,595 on The RealReal.","Designer consignment retailer The RealReal used sales data from its top ten biggest-spending cities .

"Sandy Thi Nguyen was sentenced to 90 days in jail after admitting child abuse and charitable fraud . A Colorado woman who convinced her six-year-old son he was dying from cancer to raise more than $25,000 in donations and get a free trip to Disneyland has been jailed. Sandy Thi Nguyen, 28, of Aurora, was sentenced to 90 days in jail and five years on probation on Tuesday. She had pleaded guilty to one count of charitable fraud and one count of child abuse in September. Prosecutors said Nguyen told her son that he had leukaemia and got his chemotherapy at night when he was asleep. She would also shave his head every morning before he went to school. Nguyen told people she was in severe debt because of treatments for her son. And at one point, she even said she had become pregnant in order to create a perfect match for stem cell treatment for her child. Several fundraisers were held for the child between April 2012 and March this year, when the scam was exposed. Hundreds of students at Rolling Hills Elementary School donated $18,405.46 and a charity run in Piney Creek Hollow Park raised $7,767.90, reported the Denver Post. But the fraud was exposed when Nguyen was overheard by a doctor at the hair salon where she worked discussing her son's treatments at the Children's Hospital in Denver. The doctor became concerned that she knew all the patients at the oncology unit at the hospital but did not recognise Nguyen's son. One of Nguyen's colleagues called police concerned that the family was receiving large sums of money from donations. Nguyen used $16,000 and also took her family on a Disneyland trip, the Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office said . The story of Nguyen's 'cancer-stricken' six-year-old son was also heavily featured in a charity race . After investigating, the Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office said in March that 'it was discovered that [Nguyen] did convince her son, family and community that her six-year-old had cancer and was receiving cancer treatment since approximately September 2012.' One year later, 'over $25,000' was gathered by Aurora residents, the sheriff's office said. It was revealed that 'over the last several months, Ms. Nguyen accepted at least $16,000.00 from that account as well as a trip to Disneyland for herself and her family, which was paid for by the donated funds.' Around $23,000 was found inside her home 'and in a subsequent interview, [Nguyen] admitted that her son does not have cancer, and stated that some of the money recovered was from donations received,' the Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office said. Nguyen's son, in excerpts of an arrest affidavit published by CBS Denver, said 'he believes he has cancer and is going to die' and was under the impression he received nightly chemotherapy treatments. The boy also revealed 'his mom shaves his head every morning before school,' according to the published excerpts. It was reported  Nguyen's 'cancer-stricken' son was also heavily featured in a charity race, and that she posted 'updates' on his treatment online. Officials said Nguyen allegedly posted a fake list of cancer treatments for her son online . The principal of the boy's school, Darla Thompson, said at the time: 'We are deeply troubled by these allegations and saddened to learn that an adult may have taken advantage of an innocent child and our school community.' 'But the allegations do not, in any way, diminish the concern and support demonstrated by the Rolling Hills community for a child believed to be facing a life-threatening challenge. 'It is important for our community to continue to show support and compassion for this child, who is also a victim in this case. 'The child was wrongfully led to believe that he was ill, and he was not responsible for the parent’s alleged actions.'","Sandy Thi Nguyen let her six-year-old son believe he had terminal cancer .

"Peter Lloyd says that the fact his gym has 'woman only' hours is sexist against men . When I became a member of my local gym, it was to exercise my body - not my human rights. But that's exactly what I'm doing with the Kentish Town Sports Centre in north London. The venue, owned by fitness company Better in association with Camden Council, attracts hundreds of people from all sections of society: religious, atheist, male, female, young and old. There is no dominant demographic. Everybody is welcome and everybody gets on. But not everybody is equal. Because, in an age of political over-correctness, they ban all men and boys for 442 hours every year - simply because they are male. Adding insult to injury, they still charge them the same full-price membership fee as women, but refuse to offer the equivalent option of male-only sessions. Not only is this an outrageous business model, but it's also sexist. Especially given that council officials base it almost solely on women's needs. Fair? I think not. But, because we live in an age of acceptable misandry, most people are too polite to say anything. Not me. Several weeks ago, I formally complained to the general manager, asking him to change the policy with one of three alternatives: A) maintain a women’s hour but introduce a men's alternative for fairness, B) keep women’s hour (and only women’s hour) but annually charge men less, or C) scrap single-gender sessions altogether. Hardly controversial. After all, if demand for women-only sessions is so great then the gym should put their money where their mouth is and fund it themselves. Unsurprisingly, they declined. 'A report by the Women Sport and Fitness Foundation showed that a significant proportion of women (26 per cent) “hate the way they look when they exercise”.' they replied in an email. 'This takes on an even greater significance when you consider that women feel even more self-conscious when taking part in sport and physical activity when men are present. If you are wondering who or what [we are] it's a charity that specialises in increasing women’s physical activity levels.' Translated into plain English, this means that a group of agenda-driven feminists say a minority of women 'feel' bad about their bodies. And because heterosexual men are naturally attracted to women, their very existence makes it worse, so they should be banned. No, seriously. That's like trying to clean a dirty face by rubbing a mirror. A report by the Women Sport and Fitness Foundation showed that a significant proportion of women 'hate the way they look when they exercise' It also assumes that all men in the gym are straight, when many of them are gay and have no interest in the female aesthetic. In fact, if they really wanted to, these men could be voyeuristic in the showers. So what next - gay and straight hours? And what about lesbians - can they attend women-only sessions, or would it make their straight sisters uncomfortable? Gimme a break. If these women have issues with their bodies, I truly sympathise - but it's their problem, not mine. Nor is it any other man's. And who's to say we don't have our own body hang-ups? We know for a fact that increasing numbers of men suffer from anorexia and bulimia as well as 'bigorexia' - the need to be as muscular as possible. Rates of men having cosmetic surgery are also increasing year-on-year, so the facts speak for themselves. Interestingly, women's hour also has little to do with religion. The gym have scarcely used faith to justify their policy, but - even if they did - it still wouldn't excuse their unequal price structure. Want women-only sessions for religious reasons? Fine - more power to you. But don't ask men to pay for 442 hours they can't possibly use. No God would approve of that. 'A group of agenda-driven feminists say a . minority of women 'feel' bad about their bodies. And because . heterosexual men are naturally attracted to women, their very existence . makes it worse, so they say we should be banned.' Furthermore, when I explained that men typically die before women, thus have a greater need to access fitness services – something based on cold, hard fact rather than feelings – they had no convincing answer. Tellingly, the gym's policy also assumes that only men can objectify the opposite sex. But if TV shows like Sex and the City taught us anything, it's that women can be just as forthright. In fact, only two weeks later, I was forced to complain when four teenage girls were wolf-whistling at boys in the weights area – jeering and laughing, while ranking them by size. This wouldn't be acceptable if the sexes were reversed, so why is it tolerated here? This is precisely why I’m suing them for gender bias. Not simply because their policy is unfair, but because it pathologises masculinity while simultaneously repressing it. As far as I'm concerned it also breaks the law. So far, the legal team at Camden Borough Council have simply made me laugh. They've spent hours quoting Harriet Harman's Equality Act, but continue to miss the point. No customer, male or female, should pay for gym time they're not allowed to use. It's that simple. Ultimately, however, it has nothing to do with money. At best, I want a 10 per cent refund; something I would donate to men's charity CALM (Campaign Against Living Miserably), but, like the test case of mis-sold PPI, it would empower other men to demand the same compensation - hitting the gym where it hurts. 'If these women have issues with their bodies, I truly sympathise - but it's their problem, not mine. Nor is it any other man's' But, finances aside, the Kentish Town Sports Centre has a social responsibility to encourage equality as well as physical health. Forcing men - whether 70 year-old pensioners or 13 year-old boys who attend with their mothers - to leave a room because of their gender, rather than their behaviour, is degrading. It's also eerily reminiscent of when African Americans were separated from their caucasian peers in 1940s America. Not least because the underlying maxim is the same. In this instance, that all men are inherently bad. This is a toxic message to send out, especially when those affected are frequently young boys in crucial stages of puberty and self-development. Such messages are pernicious. They criminalise men for being male, while telling women that they have less responsibility to contribute to functional gender relations. Interestingly, it's not just patrons who are angered. Last week I spoke with two of the gym's male fitness instructors who expressed their frustration with the ban - not least because, in the middle of a double-dip recession, neither can work during female-only sessions. It's insane. 'I’m suing the gym for gender bias. Not . simply because their policy is unfair, but because it pathologises . masculinity while simultaneously repressing it.' Fortunately, I have other helpful supporters who want to liberate them. Erin Pizzey, the woman who established the world's first-ever domestic violence shelter in 1972 before becoming a men's rights activist, has offered her backing. 'This discrimination has no place in modern society', she said. Meanwhile, equality charity Parity and human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell have described my fight as 'sensible and fair'. Stateside, U.S. website AVoiceForMen.com have recently added their weight to my case. Now, I ask common sense and British law to do the same. Being a test case, my claim has sparked global interest because of its potential impact. If I win, gyms all over the country could be forced to update their policies. And rightly so. Not only would this be physically healthy for people who want to exercise without restriction, but it would also be socially healthy for those who understand the toxicity of sexism, whether directed at men or women. For some, this might be a revelation in itself, but trust me: it comes from a place of genuine fairness. Yes, my case may raise some eyebrows, but hopefully it will also raise some consciousness. Because, currently, the staff at my gym are telling our young men they're dangerous by default. And that's a weight no man should learn to carry.","Peter Lloyd is suing his gym over banning men at certain times .

"Former England footballer Paul Gascoigne joked that he has nearly died '19 times' during his drinking bouts  as he spoke about his ongoing battle with the bottle in a TV interview. The 47-year-old admitted today that he 'knew he was in trouble straight away' after his most recent relapse - which saw him placed on a three-day emergency detox last month. He also spoke candidly about how his drinking affects his parents - revealing that his mother still gets upset and that his father swears at him every time he falls off the wagon. Scroll down for video . Healthy: Former England footballer Paul Gascoigne joked that he has nearly died '19 times' during his drinking bouts as he spoke about his ongoing battle with the bottle in an interview on ITV's This Morning . The former football star, who retired from the game in 2004, said that he wasn't in a 'massive state' during his most recent relapse, but admitted that it was enough 'to get himself into trouble'. Speaking in an interview on ITV's This Morning, Gascoigne looked healthy and relaxed as he told presenters Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes about his struggle. He said that he was able to recognise his most recent slip and blamed public speculation on not being able to bounce back sooner. He said: This time I knew I was in trouble straight away so I tried to put a block on it pretty quickly. 'I was just detoxing in my house, and all of a sudden I just felt I was set up by a few people with regards to the latest stint, and then I just decided to carry on drinking, which wasn't the right thing. 'I should have just gone and had a word with a few people which I didn't do. I know all the right things to do, and I just stopped doing it.

Right: The former footballer at a low point earlier this year . Candid: Speaking in an interview on ITV's This Morning, Gascoigne (left) looked healthy and relaxed as he told presenters Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes (pictured together right) about his struggle . When asked about how his family reacted to seeing photos of him looking frail, Gascoigne said that his parents still struggled - even though they are used to seeing it. He said: 'I think they're quite used to it. It's embarrassing to say, but I think they're used to it. 'My mum gets really upset, my dad - I can't swear on the show but he's like what the **** are you up to now, and that - but then I go up to visit them.' The former midfielder then revealed that he thinks he has only spent 'a year and a bit' of the last 18 years drinking. Sounding surprised at his response, Mr Holmes asked him how many times he had 'nearly died' over that same period, to which Gascoigne quipped, '19!' Gascoigne, who made 57 appearances for England, was first sectioned under the Mental Health Act in 2008 following an incident at a Newcastle hotel. Following his latest sectioning in the early hours of October 24, the star was placed on a three-day emergency detox following an apparent alcohol binge. During his time in hospital, he is said to have taken the opportunity to improve his health and fitness by doing up to 800 press-ups, sit-ups and squats every day. First outing: Gascoigne was spotted putting the bins out in his pyjamas earlier this month in his first public appearance since  being sectioned under the Mental Health Act on October 24 . Since returning to his seaside home, in Poole, Dorset, he is said to have continued with his exercise regime and his efforts appeared to be paying off when he was spotted shopping for groceries last week. He smiled towards onlookers as he bought groceries including milk and air freshener, alongside a copy of The Sun and Hello! magazine. During his outing to the supermarket, he also visited an off-licence - but only to buy cigarettes.  full .

"With its £50million price tag, this Grade II listed mansion already sounds like a home for someone with very deep pockets.That’s before you realise that the buyer will have to spend a further £20million restoring it. The run-down property, in Mayfair, is believed to be Britain’s most expensive ‘fixer-upper’ – estate agent slang for a home in need of a full refurbishment. But whoever buys it could be making a shrewd investment, as it is likely to be worth £100million after renovation. The mid-18th Century mansion, which has fallen into disrepair over the years, is set to attract keen interest from the super-rich, who often compete over trophy homes. Once restored, it will boast seven palatial bedroom suites, eight state rooms, a leisure complex and a private cinema. The main suite will span 2,000 sq/ft – twice the size of the average new UK home – and include ‘his and hers’ dressing rooms. There will be a mews home for staff, a wine room and several high-security vaults. The terraced property is thought to have been built after 1750, with previous residents including the Earl of Camperdown and the Marquis of Anglesey. Peter Wetherell, of estate agents Wetherell, said: ‘We anticipate a fierce battle by super-rich bidders.

"Protection: Parents and business will today be asked whether they want automatic online blocks to protect children from adult websites . Parents and business will today be asked whether they want automatic online blocks to protect children from adult websites. The Government is canvassing views on an ‘opt-in’ system, under which internet service providers would automatically block pornography unless an adult asked for it to be available. The move is a victory for the Daily Mail’s Block Online Porn campaign, which has called for the introduction of such content filtering systems. There is growing alarm about the impact of sexual content on the internet on Britain’s children. Just three per cent of pornographic websites require proof of age before granting access to sexually explicit material, and research suggests as many as one in three under-tens has seen pornography online. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport angered campaigners earlier this year by suggesting it was ruling out the idea of an automatic block on porn, on civil liberties grounds. But following the Mail’s campaign, ministers have now included questions about the opt-in system in the public consultation document, launched today on the department’s website. The consultation asks for views on the best way to shield children from internet pornography, and other adult and potentially harmful content. These include websites promoting suicide, anorexia, gambling, self-harm and violence, as well as those exposing them to online sexual grooming or cyber-bullying. As well as an automatic block on such content, another option under consideration is a less stringent ‘active choice’ system. This would mean customers being asked about access to adult content when setting up an internet connection on devices including computers, phones and televisions. It would list types of material and ask users to choose whether or not they want to see explicit sites. Proposals: The Government launched a consultation paper an on 'opt-in' system, under which internet service providers would automatically block pornography unless an adult asked for it to be available . The third option, known as ‘active choice plus’, would be similar, presenting users with a list of possible online content. But in this case, explicit sites would be marked as blocked as a default setting, unless the customer chose otherwise. David Cameron last month said there was a . clear case for looking at default blocks amid mounting concerns from . child safety campaigners and MPs. Currently, the opt-in system is being resisted by internet companies, which make millions from adverts for pornographic websites. The Mail’s campaign has been backed . by Deputy Children’s Commissioner Sue Berelowitz and Sara Payne, the . mother of murdered schoolgirl Sarah. But ministers yesterday warned that no filter would be 100 per cent effective. Children’s . Minister Tim Loughton said: ‘Growing numbers of parents do not feel in . control of what their families are exposed to online. ‘Many want to take responsibility, but all too often they do not know how because they find the technology too difficult to use or their children are more technically advanced then they are. ‘We have been clear that the internet industry needs to raise its game to equip families better in being able to block what their children access on the internet.’ Support: David Cameron last month said there was a clear case for looking at default blocks on explicit sites. The Mail's campaign has been backed by Sara Payne, right, the mother of murdered schoolgirl Sarah . He added: ‘There is no silver bullet to solve this. No filter can ever be 100 per cent foolproof. ‘There is a cottage industry of people, mostly operating outside the UK, continually creating and proliferating “proxy” websites that provide links to adult and harmful content. ‘Automatic filtering on its own risks lulling parents into a false sense of security and there can never be any substitute for parents taking responsibility for how, when and where their children use the internet.’ The Government consultation will last ten weeks. Ministers will respond with their favoured option later this year. The argument in favour of an opt-in system has been reinforced by a large study, conducted by the London School of Economics, which found that most parents have no idea what their children are looking at on the internet. Leading the way: How the Daily Mail has campaigned for the introduction of content filtering systems . Among parents of children who had admitted to researchers that they had looked at adult content, more than two thirds were certain their child had not, or said they did not know. In addition, more than a quarter of children admitted ignoring warnings their parents gave them about harmful material on the internet. Andrew Flanagan, head of the NSPCC, said: ‘Industry has done a huge amount in recent years and active choice is a step in the right direction. ‘But long term we back the next step which is the introduction of an opt-in filtering system for all internet accounts in the UK, if necessary, supported by Government regulation. ‘This will mean all new internet accounts will default automatically to a setting that blocks access to adult content. Over-18s can then request for this to be removed.’","Government canvassing views on .

"It sounds too good to be true, but scientists claim to have discovered a drug that reduces the harmful effects of binge drinking. The compound reduces the loss of brain cells and the inflammation that results from bouts of heavy drinking. In the long term heavy drinking can cause damage to the brain, triggering symptoms like poor memory. The team of scientists at the University of Huddersfield believe the drug could also be used to treat Alzheimer's and other diseases that damage the brain. Scientists have found the drug ethane-beta-sultam could be used to reduce the harmful effects of binge drinking. It was found to reduce the loss of brain cells and inflammation caused by bouts of heavy drinking . Health experts define binge drinking as consuming double the recommended amount of alcohol in one session. It is recommended men should drink no more than three to four units a day - the equivalent of a pint and a half of four per cent beer. And for women the limit is two to three units - the same as a 175ml glass of wine. That means a woman who drinks two large glasses of wine - six units of alcohol - within an hour, is defined as a binge drinker. Exploring ways of lessening the harmful affects of excessive drinking, the scientists focused on the effects of a compound, ethane-beta-sultam. They gave the chemical to rats who had been put on a binge drinking regime. The team noted a reduction in the loss of brain cells and inflammation in those rodents that received doses of ethane-beta-sultam. It is widely recognised heavy drinking on a regular basis can cause long-term damage. The harmful effects are particularly pronounced in teenagers, whose brains are still developing. The study found the effects of binge drinking was reduced if rats given the drug. The drug is a taurine 'pro-drug' – a type of medication that easily enters the blood stream before it is processed by the body. In the long term, binge drinking leads to symptoms such as poor memory and navigation (file photo) Until now, one of the main obstacles of treating diseases of the brain is a difficulty in drugs reaching the brain. This is because of the 'blood-brain barrier', a highly selective barrier that separates blood from the brain's extracellular fluid. It is the brain's natural defence mechanism. But the researchers found ethane-beta-sultam was able to pass through to the brain cells. Lead author Professor Page, of Huddersfield University, said: 'One of things that alcohol does is to destroy some of the brain cells which are important for navigation and orientation. 'But a combination of alcohol and our compound could overcome this damage.' He explained that the brain protects itself using glial cells, which are increased when the brain is exposed to alcohol, such as through regular binge-drinking. 'But a combination of our ethane-beta-sultam given at the same time as the alcohol decreased these levels of glial cells,' he said. Professor Page said his team have been working for 10 years to make this breakthrough. In future, research will aim to identify a compound that performs even better than ethane-beta-sultam, he said. There is a possibility that such compounds could help with the treatment of diseases such as Alzheimer's and dementia which also result from a loss of brain activity, he added. He expects there to be a discussion of the ethical issues surrounding the prospect of a drug that masks the effects of binge drinking. 'But if you accept that alcohol abuse is going to continue, then it might be sensible for society to try and treat it in some way,' said Professor Page. The study was published in the Journal of Alcoholism and Drug Dependence.","Binge drinking causes loss of brain cells and inflammation .

"Black Friday shoppers looking for discounts on Christmas gifts and electronics at the mall today may be met by government workers trying to sell them another big ticket item: Obamacare. The Health and Human Services Department is partnering with Westfield Shopping Centers this weekend to provide deal-seekers with information on health insurance ahead of a Feb. 15 deadline for Americans without coverage to purchase it or pay a fine. It's also working with the National Community Pharmacists Association and XO Group Inc., the owner of popular websites The Knot, The Nest and The Bump, to promote the federal health exchanges on 'small business Saturday' and 'cyber Monday'. A healthcare assistor helps an uninsured man sign up for the Affordable Care Act outside the Jackson-Hinds Comprehensive Health Center in Jackson, Mississippi in October of 2013. Today healthcare navigators are targeting potential new enrollees outside of shopping malls as they flood stores in search of Black Friday sales . HHS announced a long-term partnership with the three companies this week that will continue through the end of the current open enrollment period. Select Westfield malls in California, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, Connecticut, Maryland, New York and Washington will 'provide tables, chairs and other necessary items' for health navigators and assistors and allow them to pass out flyers, an HHS statement on the effort said. Per the press release, approximately 425 million consumers shopped at Westfield's properties last year alone, making it's more than 40 locations in the U.S. ripe  for the recruitment of new healthcare enrollees. The National Community of Pharmacists (NPCA), represents roughly 23,000 independent drug stores in the U.S. and its members account dispense close to half of the country's retail prescriptions. 'Community pharmacists will be available to help patients with their health care needs, from medication counseling to accessing insurance coverage, this week just as they do all year,' NCPA CEO B. Douglas Hoey said in a statement confirming his organization's participation in the HHS outreach events. 'We appreciate Secretary Burwell’s acknowledgment of the contributions of community pharmacists and we encourage consumers to check out their locally owned, community pharmacies this Small Business Saturday.' The XO Group is reparterning with HHS, having already helped it sell plans at the end of the open enrollment period last year. The companies online entities are among the premiere wedding planning, home-buying and parenting websites in America. XO Group CEO Mike Steib said in recent statement his company was 'honored' to be working with the White House. A pro-Obamacare post on the company's The Nest site advises users that '100,000 lives could be saved each year, if everyone in the U.S. received recommended clinical preventive care like screenings and checkups with doctors, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.' It goes on to encourage users to use 'cyber Monday' to 'sign up for the best deal of your life on HealthCare.gov by enrolling in health insurance, if you don’t already have a work-based plan.'

An old advisory on The Knot that's being re-purposed for the current Obamacare campaign gives visitors '3 Reasons To #GetCovered.' 'We know this has nothing to do with your or the latest trend for grooms, but this is important. TheKnot.com and our awesome sister sites TheNest.com and TheBump.com have partnered up with The White House to spread the word about the upcoming deadline,' it reads. 'If you aren’t covered now, go to Healthcare.gov and get it done. It’s fast, easy and totally worth the peace of mind.' A third promotion running on The Bump features a picture of the Obamas and a letter from the first lady giving thanks that she and her husband had jobs that provided healthcare insurance when she was pregnant with their daughters, Sasha and Malia. 'Every mother and every father in this country deserves this kind of peace of mind – and that’s what the Affordable Care Act is all about,' she wrote in the 2014 letter explaining the benefits of Obamacare and how to sign up for coverage. More than 7 million Americans purchased health insurances through the federal marketplace last year, and HHS has set a goal of increasing that to 9 million by the end of the fiscal year 2015. Already, close to a half million people have applied, HHS says, and the marketplace has only been open for business since Nov. 15. 'It's still early and we have a long way to go, but we're off to a solid start,' HHS Secretary Slyvia Burwell said this week. According to Reuters 52 percent of the 462,125 people of this year's initial enrollees were returning customers, while the rest were new buyers.","Assistors passing out flyers at Westfield malls in California, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, Connecticut, Maryland, New York and Washington .

"At least 120 people are feared dead and 270 more injured after gunmen and suicide bombers attacked a mosque in northern Nigeria during Friday prayers this afternoon. Witnesses reported three separate explosions and said the gunmen opened fire on worshippers in the assault at the Grand mosque in Kano, in the west African country's second-largest city. Nigerian Captain Ikechukwu Eze confirmed the blasts at the site where hundreds had gathered to listen to a sermon from the city's chief imam and prayers were under way at 2pm local time. Scroll down for video . A crowd looks at the wreckage left after multiple bombings at Grand Mosque in Kano. At least 120 are feared dead and 270 injured after gunmen and suicide bombers attacked the mosque today during Friday prayers . A car damaged from the blasts. Local Muslim leader the Emir of Kano last week called for people to arm themselves against Islamist militant group Boko Haram - whom analysts believe are behind the attack . Analysts said the attack bore the hallmarks of Islamist militant group Boko Haram. The local muslim leader the Emir of Kano had recently called for people to arm themselves against the extremists. One eyewitness told the BBC's Focus on Africa: 'The imam was about to start prayer when he saw somebody in a car trying to force himself into the mosque. 'But when people stopped him, he detonated the explosions. People started running helter-skelter.' Grand mosque leader the Emir of Kano, the second highest Islamic authority in the country, usually leads prayers for worshippers. Reports have varied over whether he was present during the attack. Smoke billows outside the mosque where witnesses reported at least three separate explosions. Hundreds had gathered to listen to a sermon from the city's chief imam and prayers had already been under way . A witness said the imam 'was about to start prayer when he saw somebody in a car trying to force himself into the mosque. But when stopped, he detonated the explosions. People started running helter-skelter' He told gatherers last week that people should wage war against Boko Haram, which have been fighting a guerilla war to bring about a hardline Islamic state in Nigeria's north since 2009. The blasts in Kano came after a bomb attack was foiled against a mosque in the northeastern city of Maiduguri earlier today, five days after two female suicide bombers killed over 45 people in the city. National police spokesman Emmanuel Ojukwu told AFP that the bombers blew themselves up in quick succession then 'gunmen opened fire on those who were trying to escape'. The remains of a victim are rushed away after the bomb and gun attack at the Central Mosque this afternoon . Locals transport the remains to Murtala Mohammed specialist hospital for burial according to Muslim rites . Ojukwu said he did not know whether the suicide bombers were male or female, after a spate of attacks by women in recent months, and did not give an exact figure on the number of gunmen. But he said an angry mob killed four of the shooters in the chaotic aftermath. Boko Haram was responsible for the kidnap of more than 200 teenage girls from a school in the town of Chibok in April this year, in the north of Nigeria which is mainly Muslim. More than 1.5 million Nigerians displaced by the extremist group have been flocking to refugee camps across the country's northeast, where facilities are overcrowded and there is a shortage of supplies.

"Broadcast television will die off within the next 16 years, the CEO of Netflix has said. Reed Hastings, whose streaming media firm boasts more than 53million users, declared that the continuous rise of on-demand content will cause traditional TV to become obsolete by 2030. Speaking at an industry event in Mexico City, he said: 'It’s kind of like the horse, you know, the horse was good until we had the car. The age of broadcast TV will probably last until 2030.' Prediction: Broadcast television will die off by 2030, the CEO of Netflix, Reed Hastings (pictured), has claimed . With its impressive audience, rapid growth and exclusive content such as Orange Is The New Black, Netflix continues to transform how consumers watch TV shows and movies. And with  TV viewership having dropped  50 per cent between 2002 and 2012, according to the Observer, Mr Hasting's prediction could end up being correct. The businessman, who has an estimated net worth of $860million, was appearing at the event to discuss Nielsen's plans to start measuring Netflix's viewership next month - a novel proposal. But downplaying the significance of the plans - which will not include the measurement of content on mobile devices, he told The Hollywood Reporter: 'It's not very relevant. Not long left: Mr Hastings, whose streaming media firm boasts more than 53million users, declared that the rise of on-demand content will cause traditional TV to become obsolete within the next 16 years (file picture) 'There's so much viewing that happens on a mobile phone or an iPad that [Nielsen won't] capture.' He added that the company was growing rapidly in Latin America, saying: 'It is one of the fastest growth areas in the world in terms of broadband households and Internet connectivity.' Earlier this year, Netflix, which will also shortly become available in Australia and New Zealand, announced plans to disrupt how movies make their official debut. Ever-growing: With its impressive audience, rapid growth and exclusive content such as Orange Is The New Black, Netflix (file picture) continues to transform how global consumers watch TV shows and movies . In a move which 'breaks the stranglehold that movie theaters have' on film releases, it will debut the sequel to 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' on the same day as it hits IMAX theaters. To keep up with its progression and production of exclusive content, Netflix, co-founded by Mr Hastings and Marc Randolph in 1997, also announced a price hike for new customers in May. The increase of $1  a month raised the cost of a subscription to $8.99 per month.","Reed Hastings, Netflix CEO, appeared at an industry event in Mexico City .

"A 29-year-old man who has become one of Britain's youngest grandparents was left red-faced after nurses asked him to prove he was over 16 as he tried to visit his daughter's baby. Unemployed Shem Davies was overjoyed when 14-year-old Tia gave birth to Gracie earlier this month. But when he tried to visit the ward, maternity nurses thought the fresh-faced granddad was in fact the teenage father of Gracie and asked him to prove his age. Shem and former girlfriend Kelly John, 30, became parents to Tia at the age of 15. Their daughter's boyfriend, Jordan Williams, is 15. Shem said: 'It is an absolute joy to see Gracie thriving. I'm incredibly proud of Tia. She'll be a brilliant mum. At first I wasn't overly pleased that she was pregnant but I soon got over than. Now it's all about being positive. Happy family: Jordan, bottom left, with Tia and Gracie, and proud grandparents Shem and Kelly . 'I've got to know Jordan and he's shaping up to be a decent young man,' Shem told The People. But the arrival of Gracie wasn't easy as Tia was diagnosed with pre-eclampsia, seven weeks before her due date. Worried doctors decided their best option would be to deliver the tot by Caesarean section. The condition, which often leaves . expectant mothers with high blood pressure and protein in their urine, . could lead to life-threatening symptoms for both mother and baby. Tia said the contrast between the carefree fun of the school playground and then the fear of death for her and the baby was something she would never forget. Happily after . a 25 minute operation Gracie was born but only weighed 2lb and was . rushed to the special care unit at the Princess of Wales Hospital in . Bridgend, which is close to the family home. Little . Gracie is still being kept in an incubator but has managed to put on . enough weight which means she will be allowed home in a few weeks. A week after Gracie was born Tia celebrated her 15th birthday in the ward surrounded by friends and family. Fighter: Tiny Gracie is thriving but will be in an incubator for a few weeks . Proud parents: Jordan and Tia with their newborn daughter Gracie who was born prematurely . The teenager, who has been dating Jordan for 18 months and wants to be a hairdresser, said she didn't plan on celebrating her birthday in hospital but added that her baby daughter was the best present she could ask for. Once mother and daughter have been released from hospital they will be staying with grandmother Kelly so that Tia can finish school. Grandad Shem, who has a young son of his own, said he is keen to get stuck in and help Tia and Jordan settle into life. Jordan, who sat his final GCSE just weeks before Gracie arrived, said he understands responsibility. 'I'm captain of the school rugby team and that's like having 14 kids.' Father and daughter: Shem with his daughter Tia and granddaughter Gracie . Despite her young age, mother Tia says that she would not be happy if newborn Gracie became pregnant at 14 but that she would do as her mum did, which is respect her choice to have a child. She also paid tribute to her mother, who was 15 when she was born, saying that she could not have wished for a better parent and role model adding that they have a very close relationship. Britain's high teenage pregnancy rate means that many more young people in this generation are set to become grandparents in their late twenties and early thirties. The latest figures show in 2009 38,259 girls under 18 became pregnant, but nearly 50 per cent had a termination. The UK still leads the way when it comes to young mothers, and our rate is five-times higher than in the Netherlands and twice that of France and Spain.","He thinks the teenage father of the child is a 'decent young man'

Scroll down for video . Tower Bridge has gone red, white and blue in preparation for its starring role in the Diamond Jubilee and the London Olympics . A new system using 3,800 LED lights was tested this week, allowing the bridge to gleam 'diamond white' for the weekend . In preparation for the summer of celebration which will see both the Queen's Diamond Jubilee and the Olympic games the iconic landmark was given a makeover and a spruce up worthy of being paraded in front of the eyes of the world. The first test will be the Royal Jubilee Pageant on Sunday which will see the Queen and six senior members of the royal family travel down the Thames on the royal barge. They will be accompanied by a flotilla of vessles of all shapes and sizes. The pageant will conclude with a flypast of nine Navy helicopters in a diamond formation, led by a Second World War Swordfish biplane.

Flypast . director Lt-Cdr Barney Wainwright said: 'The pilot will be . concentrating very carefully on his formation position. The pilots were . briefed only last week by the admiral not to be distracted.' Tower Bridge swung open today as ships old and new took to the Thames ahead of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee river pageant this weekend. A small flotilla of vessels representing the Royal Navy's Royal Barge Honour Guard - including specialist armed police in speedboats - passed under the raised bridge as sailors from HMS Hurworth looked on.

On the day, ten naval vessels will surround the Queen's Barge, while almost a thousand other boats will take part in the procession. Security for the pageant will be extremely tight, with Scotland Yard saying it is the biggest ever security operation for the Queen. Police frogmen will carry out underwater searches while bridges and river banks will be monitored and all the boats taking part will be searched, the Evening Standard reported.

Scotland Yard said it had been planning security for the past 18 months and described the operation as bigger than last year’s royal wedding. Security was strengthened even further after activist Trenton Oldfield dived into the river to disrupt the Boat Race in April. Twenty RNLI lifeboats will be on duty as well as Port of London and London fire brigade vessels. In total around 190 safety boats will be afloat. Deputy assistant commissioner Stephen Kavanagh, who is leading the security operation, said: 'This is a huge historic event for London and it is a privilege to be policing. 'We want our officers to be part of the celebrations but we are also prepared for possible protests and we have appropriate levels of security.

'We remind people that their right to protest will be balanced against the rights of those people who have come to attend this historic event. I would say that any individual who is thinking of making a protest and diving into the water should think very carefully about their own safety with the number of boats afloat.' Police say they have intelligence of at least two groups which are threatening protests. One is the republican Jubilee Protest which says demonstrators will unfurl banners near City Hall. Organisers claim it will be the 'biggest and boldest anti-monarchy protest in modern times.' Other anarchist groups are also thought to be plotting protests. Skippers and crews of the 1,000 vessels, many of whom will unfamiliar with navigating the Thames, have been urged not to drink until afterwards.

"Speaking out: Ed Miliband has professed he does not believe in God - but says he does still have 'faith' Ed Miliband has professed that he does not believe in God - but says he does still have ‘faith’. The Labour leader, speaking about his religious beliefs in detail for the first time, said he would be the ‘first Jewish prime minister’ if he wins the next election. But he said his faith, which is ‘part of who I am’, is compatible with being an atheist, claiming that like many religious believers, he hopes to ‘change the world’. David Cameron, who spoke about his own faith this week, is the only one of the three party leaders to say he believes in God, as Nick Clegg is also an atheist. But during his tour of Israel and the West Bank, Mr Miliband distanced himself from the last Labour government which, in the words of spin doctor Alistair Campbell, did not ‘do God’. Britain, he said in an interview, is a ‘Christian country’ despite declining observance, and he strongly believes religion ‘nourishes people’. He said: ‘I have a particular faith. I describe myself as a Jewish atheist. I’m Jewish by birth origin and it’s a part of who I am. ‘I don’t believe in God, but I think faith is a really, really important thing to a lot of people. It provides nourishment for lots of people. ‘In terms of faith for me, it’s a faith about how you change the world. And that is actually true for a lot of religious people as well.’ Faith, he said, has an ‘important place in society’ and he added that many faith schools do an ‘incredible job.’ On tour: During his tour of Israel and the West Bank, Mr Miliband distanced himself from the last Labour government.

Jewish prime minister if we win the election’, he said yesterday. The . Victorian Conservative Benjamin Disraeli, who coined the term ‘One . Nation’ that is now a Labour mantra, is often remembered as the first, . as he was born to Italian Jewish parents. But . he was baptised as an Anglican aged 12 when his father left the . religion - which would later enable him to run for parliament in 1837, . from which Jews were excluded until 1858.

He even claimed Jesus was . responsible for his ‘Big Society’ policy. Mr Miliband added that Britain was ‘really lucky’ to have the Church of England as the established church. ‘It . is a great institution in terms of what it does in our society, not . just spiritual faith and nourishment that it gives to lots of people, . but also the good work it does in communities’, he said.

"A 15-minute test you take at home can show up the first signs of mental decline nearly as well as diagnostic exams. The written test could be used to help catch and treat Alzheimer’s early. U.S. researchers who developed it say healthy older people would do the test at home and share the results with doctors so they could keep track of their condition. The test: US researchers say this home-test will be able to chart how older people are progressing . The questions range from simple feats of memory – writing the date, for example – to more complex everyday tasks, such as working out the amount of change needed when shopping. Other sections are more open-ended, with one asking: ‘How are a corkscrew and a hammer similar? Write down how they are alike.’ More than 1,000 people aged 50 and over were given the test, and the results indicated 28 per cent of them had cognitive impairment, a mild loss of mental function. Research: A study found the mini exam accurately identifies people with mild loss of mental function . That closely matched the results of detailed diagnostic tests on  the same group, suggesting the test could be a useful indicator.  Researcher Dr Douglas Scharre, director of cognitive neurology at Ohio State University, said that  it could lead to dementia being diagnosed earlier. He said: ‘This self-administered test correlated very well with detailed cognitive testing. ‘If we catch this cognitive change really early, then we can start potential treatments much earlier than without this test.’ While the test does not diagnose disease, it allows doctors to easily track changes in a patient’s cognitive skills by observing how their answers change over time. Dr Scharre added: ‘We can give them the test periodically and, the moment we notice any changes in their cognitive abilities, we can intervene much more rapidly.’ Earlier research demonstrated that the test can detect four out of five people with mild thinking and memory issues. Around 95 per cent of people who do not have memory or thinking problems will get a normal score. Participants in the study were recruited from senior citizens’ centres, health fairs, educational talks, and free memory screening advertised in newspapers. Volunteers were tested on mental orientation, language, reasoning, spatial ability, problem solving  and memory. Dr Simon Ridley, from the charity Alzheimer’s Research UK, warned that anyone concerned about memory loss should see a doctor. Doctors warn the test will not diagnose dementia, merely mild loss of mental function. It is still not known whether screening would be beneficial for Alzheimer's patients . He said: ‘Further research is needed to confirm whether the  test would be suitable to assess and track changes in people’s memory and thinking skills. ‘One drawback is that the test was not compared with existing cognitive tests. ‘It’s important to note that the test is not designed to diagnose dementia, and people who are worried about their memory should seek advice from a doctor rather than attempting self-diagnosis with a test at home. ‘There is not enough evidence to suggest dementia screening for people who do not have memory concerns would be beneficial.’","Questions range from writing date to working out change from shopping bill .

"Former Labour transport minister Sadiq Khan, 'looked at his mobile' while driving . A former Labour transport minister has been reported to police after he was accused of using his mobile phone while driving towards Parliament. The party’s justice spokesman Sadiq Khan, an award-winning road safety campaigner, allegedly looked down at his phone while at the wheel. A picture sent to the police appeared to show the 44-year-old MP for Tooting, who is expected to seek nomination as Labour’s London mayoral candidate, with his phone in his hand as he drove a grey Volkswagen car yesterday morning. Conservative MP Justin Tomlinson wrote to the Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe to call for an investigation. Mr Khan was this year named road safety parliamentarian of the month in March by the charity Brake. Accepting the award, he said he had ‘campaigned to make our roads safer’ during his nine years as an MP. Ed Miliband’s roads spokesman Richard Burden this summer called for a year-long ban for anyone caught using their mobile phone while behind the wheel. A witness claims he saw Mr Khan ‘driving a grey VW… clearly checking text or email messages on his phone several times’. The witness took a photograph of what appeared to be Mr Khan at around 9am yesterday before watching him drive along Albert Embankment towards the Houses of Parliament. Last night Mr Tomlinson, MP for North Swindon, wrote to Sir Bernard ‘to report a breach of laws governing the use of a mobile when in control of a motor vehicle and potentially dangerous driving’. He wrote: ‘I would be very grateful if you could investigate this further – road safety is a serious issue and those who make the laws should certainly not be above them.’ Caught: Mr Khan, seen here with Ed Miliband, was using his mobile phone while driving, despite being named National Road Safety Campaigner of the Year by the charity Brake . A spokesman for Brake said: ‘It is important that public figures set a positive example of safe driving behaviour, and it is disappointing if any politician fails to do so, particularly when they have a strong record of road safety work in the past.’ The AA last week warned that mobile phone use by drivers had reached ‘epidemic’ proportions. Figures show fatal accidents in which a driver using a mobile phone was a contributory factor increased from 17 in 2012 to 22 in 2013 – a rise of 29 per cent, or five deaths. All accidents in which mobile phone use has played a part rose from 378 to 422 – an increase of 10 per cent. Mr Khan did not respond to a request to comment.","Former Labour transport minister caught using his phone while driving .

"Porsche is replacing the engines of all of its £100,000 current model 911 GT3 supercars after two of the 200mph vehicles caught fire. It has told hundreds of wealthy and celebrity owners - including BBC Top Gear presenter Richard Hammond - to stop driving the cars because of the blaze risk while the engines are replaced. The multi-million pound engine replacement announcement follows Porsche’s decision last month to warn the drivers of all 785 of the model year 2014 911 GT3 cars produced of the fire risk. That includes 160 in the UK of which 60 are still to be delivered. Scroll down for video . (File picture of 201 model) Porsche is replacing the engines of all of its £100,000 current model 911 GT3 supercars . But it is understood deliveries of up to a further 1,000 of the two-seater sports cars world-wide have been halted while the engines are replaced, making nearly 1,800 vehicles affected in total – nearly £200million’s worth of vehicles at showroom prices. In Britain alone the tally of cars affected will top £16million. Top Gear presenter Mr Hammond, nicknamed 'Hamster', recently wrote of his love for the GT3, saying it was 'so good, I had to buy one myself'. Road-testing the vehicle he noted: 'There are no bad points about this car'. Porsche’s engine replacement programme came after the Stuttgart-based car-firm said it investigated two engine fires in which a loosened fastener caused oil to leak, which then caught fire. The two fires happened in Italy and in Switzerland but no one was injured, said a Porsche official. The GT3 is the sportiest of the 16 variants of the Porsche 911s on sale and is often driven by their owners on race tracks at special ‘track days’. Other 911 models and variants are not affected, said Porsche. Porsche, part of the giant German Volkswagen group, said it is cooperating with regulators in the recall and engine replacements, and is in touch with each customer who owns one of the affected vehicles. Porsche did not say how much it will cost to replace the 785 engines. The new engines will have ‘optimized fasteners’ said the company. The Porsche 911 GT3 went on sale at the end of last year and has a UK list price of £100,540. It has a top speed of 196mph and can accelerate from rest to 62 mph in just 3.5 seconds . A Porshe UK spokesman said: ‘As far as the cost of an engine is concerned, we're unable to give a definitive figure as it will vary according to each situation, such as how much needs replacing, labour costs and so on. But as far as Porsche is concerned, we don't put a price on our customers' safety and our engineering reputation.’ In a statement Porsche in Stuttgart said: ‘Sports car manufacturer Porsche will be replacing the engines of all 911 GT3 vehicles of model year 2014. This is the corrective action derived from intensive internal analyses that were initiated in response to two engine fires. ‘Meanwhile, it has been confirmed that engine damage resulted from a loosened screw joint on the connecting rod. The loose connecting rod damaged the crankcase, which in both cases led to leakage of oil which then ignited.’ Porsche said: ‘After becoming aware of the two accident cases, Porsche promptly took action to avoid any risk to customers by advising them to cease using the affected 785 vehicles until further notice and have them picked up by a Porsche Centre. ‘Now, engines with optimised screw fittings will be used in all Porsche 911 GT3 vehicles of model year 2014 – including in those that have not been delivered yet. ‘The relevant Porsche Centres are in direct communication with customers worldwide to discuss the further course of action. ‘Porsche points out that no other 911 models or other model series are affected by this action.’ Of the 785 GT3 models that will have engines replaced, about 400 were shipped to the United States, and about half of those have been sold. It has a base price of about $131,000 (94,200 euros) in the United States and about 137,000 euros ($191,000) in Europe.","Porsche warned car owners should stop driving them because of fire risk .

"Nigel Farage is on course to win his first Commons seat after a  new poll showed UKIP leading in Eastleigh, the Hampshire constituency where the party narrowly failed to win last year’s by-election. Support for Mr Farage’s party is running at 32 per cent in Eastleigh – four points ahead of the Conservatives on 28 per cent, and five points ahead of the Liberal Democrats, who hold the seat. It is the first time a constituency poll has put UKIP in the lead. UKIP founder Dr Alan Sked attacked current party leader Nigel Farage branding him a 'dim, racist alcoholic' The boost for the party came as its founder, Dr Alan Sked, gave an astonishing interview in which he described Mr Farage as ‘alcoholic, dim and racist’ and repeated claims he first made in this newspaper a decade ago – which Mr Farage strongly denies  – that the UKIP leader had referred to black people as ‘n*****s’. The Survation poll was carried out a year after UKIP rocked Westminster by coming within four percentage points of winning Eastleigh. Despite his criticism, Dr Sked believes Nigel Farage (pictured) will win a seat at the next general election . The poll puts UKIP top even though Mr Farage was not suggested as the likely candidate, indicating that the party’s appeal is not necessarily dependent on his ‘personality cult’. Earlier this month a Mail on Sunday poll in Folkestone, where the UKIP leader has hinted he might stand at next year’s General Election, put Mr Farage three points behind the incumbent Conservative MP. But the new poll – funded by Alan Bown, a UKIP donor – indicates his best chance of winning a Commons seat might lie in three-way marginals such as Eastleigh. Dr Sked made the scathing remarks about Mr Farage during an interview published today. The London School of Economics professor also repeated a claim he made in 2004 that Mr Farage had once said: ‘We will never win the n****r vote.’ In his interview with the Parliament Street think-tank, Dr Sked also claims that Mr Farage admires  Russian president Vladimir Putin because ‘Putin is clearly a nasty piece of work and Nigel probably identifies with that’. A UKIP spokesman said: ‘Dr Sked is free to hold whatever view he likes of our party and our leader, but his repeated claim that Nigel used the “N word” is untrue and has been vigorously denied before.’","UKIP is topping the opinion polls in Eastleigh, Hampshire at 32 percent .

"Atheist Richard Dawkins has outraged Muslims after describing looters who destroyed manuscripts in Mali as ‘Islamic barbarians’. The 71-year-old author of The God Delusion was referring to the severe damage caused by Islamist extremists to a sacred library in Timbuktu but his remarks were seen as insulting to all Muslims. Oxford University academic Professor Dawkins told his 600,000 Twitter followers on Tuesday: ‘Like Alexandria, like Bamiyan, Timbuktu's priceless manuscript heritage destroyed by Islamic barbarians.’ Comments: Richard Dawkins said Timbuktu's manuscript heritage was 'destroyed by Islamic barbarians' But his comments were criticised, with some followers claiming he was unjustly attacking Islam and others saying he should be considering vandalism committed by Christians, reported the Daily Telegraph. Muslim Twitter user ‘Shawa5i Al Nasseri’ from the United Arab Emirates said: 'You call us barbarians, truly no respect', before later adding: 'How do you explain this ""destroyed by Islamic barbarians?”’ Professor Dawkins responded to the comments by saying: ‘You mean you were one of those who burned the books in Timbuktu? No? I thought not. So I wasn't calling you a barbarian was I.’ He also said to all of his followers: ‘I was calling Islamic BARBARIANS barbarians’, adding: ‘By “Islamic barbarians” I mean those Muslims who are also barbarians. I do not of course mean all Muslims.’ Backlash: Professor Dawkins's comments on Twitter were criticised, with some followers claiming he was unjustly attacking Islam and others saying he should have considered vandalism acts by Christians . Professor Dawkins later added: ‘Xtian (Christian) barbarians murder abortion doctors. Most Xtians (Christians) are not barbarians. Stalin was an atheist barbarian. Most atheists are not barbarians.’ 'By ""Islamic barbarians"" I mean those Muslims who are also barbarians. I do not of course mean all Muslims' Richard Dawkins . On Monday Islamists were said to have burned down the world-famous Ahmed Baba Institute library containing priceless manuscripts and artefacts. Timbuktu’s mayor Ousmane Halle said: ‘They torched all the important ancient manuscripts. The ancient books of geography and science. It is the history of Timbuktu, of its people.’ However a South African university said yesterday that the extremists damaged or stole only a limited number of manuscripts in Timbuktu before they fled the fabled desert city. 'Priceless heritage': Some of the 20,000 preserved ancient Islamic manuscripts which rest in air-conditioned rooms are displayed at the Ahmed Baba Institute in Timbuktu, Mali (file picture) People in the city reported that there was no malicious destruction of any library or collection, said the University of Cape Town, which helped fund a state-of-the-art library to house manuscripts. 'They torched all the important ancient manuscripts. The ancient books of geography and science. It is the history of Timbuktu, of its people' Ousmane Halle, Timbuktu’s mayor . The Chief Rabbi Lord Sacks claimed last year that a ‘profoundly anti-Semitic’ comment in Professor Dawkins's The God Delusion likened God portrayed in Jewish texts to a fictional villain. But Professor Dawkins said he was ‘anti-God’ rather than ‘anti-Jewish’ and claimed the allegation from Lord Sacks was ‘ridiculous’. Meanwhile, Professor Dawkins and former Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams will debate the role of religion in the modern world at the Cambridge Union Society tonight. Union president Ben Kentish said it should be a highlight of the debating society's 200-year history. ‘Our speakers are the most renowned commentators on this subject,’ he added.","Richard Dawkins's tweet about library in Timbuktu, Mali, causes offence .

"A federal judge in Connecticut has clamped down on a death row inmate’s complaints that the food he is being served in prison is not kosher. Steven Hayes, who is awaiting execution for the brutal rape, torture and murder of the Petit family, sued the Department of Correction in August, alleging the preparation practices for kosher meals in the kitchen at the state's highest-security prison do not conform to Jewish dietary laws. Hayes describes himself in the lawsuit as an Orthodox Jew and says he's been requesting a kosher diet since May 2013. Scroll down for video . Denied: A federal judge in Connecticut has rejected a complaint by death row inmate Steven Hayes, who sued the Corrections Department claiming prison food was not kosher . He says he has suffered ‘almost two years of emotional injury from having to choose between following God and starving or choosing sin to survive.’ Hayes and Joshua Komisarjevsky were sentenced to die for the 2007 murders of Jennifer Hawke-Petit and her daughters, 17-year-old Hayley and 11-year-old Michaela, at the family's home in Cheshire. The victims were tied up, two of them were sexually assaulted and their bodies were found after the home was set on fire. Hawke-Petit's husband, Dr. William Petit, was severely beaten, but survived. U.S. District Court Judge Alvin Thompson, in a ruling dated Tuesday, rejected Hayes' motions for a hearing and a temporary injunction. The judge noted that Hayes is offered kosher meals, and the state Department of Correction has two rabbis who periodically monitor the preparation of kosher foods in the prison system. The judge said both rabbis certified that the food and the food preparation process comply with dietary laws. ‘Although (Hayes) raises as an issue the lack of a reliable orthodox certificate or an onsite Jewish overseer, he provides no evidence suggesting that their absence leads to a finding that the meals are not kosher,’ the judge wrote. Thompson did not throw out the lawsuit. But in rejecting the motions, he found there is not a likelihood that it will succeed. Horrific: Dr Petit (right) was severely beaten and dumped in the basement as his daughters Michaela, 11, Hayley, 17, were tied to their beds only to be killed via smoke inhalation when their captors set alight their Connecticut home after raping and strangling their mother, Jennifer . In a handwritten amended complaint made public earlier this month, Hayes said he hasn't eaten any non-kosher food since August 24, and now weighs less than 120lbs. State prison documents show the 5-foot-7 Hayes weighed 170lbs at the time of his arrest in 2007. The department offers kosher food, but Hayes contends it isn't kosher because of cross-contamination. Karen Martucci, a spokeswoman for the Correction Department, said this month that Hayes has denied to prison officials that he is on a hunger strike. Hayes also alleges he has been the subject of other religious discrimination in prison and was placed on a suicide watch for observing a fast during the Yom Kippur holiday last year. This is not his first lawsuit against the department. In past litigation, none of which have been successful, Hayes has complained about his mental health care, harassment from prison staff and the temperature in his cell. In March, Hayes was found in a stable condition in his cell after speaking many times of wanting to die because of his guilt over his horrifying crime. In 2007, Petit and his family were held hostage for hours at their Cheshire, Connecticut home before it was set alight by invaders Steven Hayes and Joshua Komisarjevsky. Horrifying: Dr. William Petit Jr.(left) with his daughters Michaela, (front), Hayley, (back left), and his wife, Jennifer Hawke-Petit. In June 2007. Petit was beaten and his wife and two daughters killed during a home invasion in Cheshire, Connecticut . Shocking: Hayes raped and strangled Jennifer Hawke-Petit. Her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11, died of smoke inhalation after they were doused with gasoline and the house was set on fire . A photo from the crime scene shows the extent of the blaze set by Steven Hayes and Joshua Komisarjevsky, which killed Petit's family . Dr Petit was severely beaten and dumped in the basement as his daughters Michaela, 11, Hayley, 17, were tied to their beds. After the 11-year-old was raped and her mother raped and strangled to death, the intruders set the home ablaze and left all but Petit dead. Hayes tried to commit suicide during his 2010 trial and upon hearing he would face the death penalty, told a New Haven court 'Death, to me, will be a welcome relief.' The pair spotted Hawke-Petit at a supermarket and followed her to her home in Cheshire, Connecticut, where they tied up the family. Hayes raped and strangled Hawke-Petit and Komisarjevsky sexually assaulted Michaela. Both Michaela and her sister, Hayley, were tied to their beds and died of smoke inhalation after the men doused the home with gas and set it on fire. Connecticut repealed the death penalty in 2012, but the does law not apply to those who had already been sentenced to death. On death row: Petit and his family were held hostage for hours at their Cheshire, Connecticut home before it was set alight by invaders Steven Hayes (left) and Joshua Komisarjevsky (right) In testimony at the trial, Hayes said he had frequently attempted suicide, slashing his wrists, slamming his mother's car into a rock and tying a sock around his neck. He also told The Hartford Courant in a 2012 interview that he concocted a plan to end his own life by obtaining oysters, to which he is deathly allergic. He said he fabricated claims in letters that he killed 17 people in hopes that prison authorities would notify police and he could then trade information for food, including oysters. Joshua Komisarjevsky also was convicted and sentenced to death for the home invasion killings.","Steven Hayes filed a lawsuit claiming the food is not genuinely kosher because of contamination .

"Ministers were accused of putting the profits of internet giants ahead of the safety of children yesterday in the row over online porn. Child safety campaigners said the Coalition’s decision to veto an automatic block – despite clear evidence that parents support the idea – had left them ‘back at square one’. Rather than forcing users to ‘opt in’ for pornography, internet service providers will merely be asked to ‘actively encourage’ parents to switch on filters if children are likely to be using computers in the home. Scroll down for video . Vulnerable: Ministers were accused of backing down from an automatic ban on online pornography to stop children being exposed to it. Picture posed by model . The decision came despite more than 40 per cent of parents responding to the Government’s own consultation saying they knew their children had accessed online porn. Children’s charities, backed by the Daily Mail, have led a concerted campaign for an automatic block on online porn but their views have also been ignored. A Downing Street source last night claimed the package amounted to ‘the most rigorous system for protecting children from online dangers in the world’. But Labour’s deputy leader Harriet Harman accused ministers of ‘broken promises’ over the issue, saying they had bowed to pressure from the internet industry, which is opposed to restrictions on the lucrative porn sector. The Prime Minister has put vested interests – in this case ISPs – ahead of the views of parents and ahead of protecting our children,’ she said. Claude Knights, director of children’s safeguarding charity Kidscape, said: ‘This really is disappointing. The Daily Mail has led a campaign calling for limiting access to online pornography . ‘We felt creating an opt-in requirement would have ensured greater safeguarding for children. 'Of course it would not have stopped everything but it would have definitely been a big step in the right direction. ‘Where do we stand now? Really we are back to square one. We have some children who are more at risk than others.’ The Government’s response to a high-profile consultation on protecting children from online dangers was slipped out on the Department for Education’s website last Friday without fanfare. The NSPCC and others campaigned to force those wishing to view adult sites into a new ‘opt in’ system that would require contacting their ISP. The proposal was bitterly opposed by the powerful internet industry. Some 35 per cent of parents responding to the consultation backed the ‘opt-in’ system, with a further 15 per cent wanting it imposed with additional controls. John Carr, of the Children’s Charities’ Coalition on Internet Safety, said mobile phone companies have been automatically blocking adult websites for nearly a decade and there was no reason ISPs could not do the same. ‘What the Government has proposed is a step forward, we recognise that, but we are disappointed they did not go further,’  he said. Miranda Suit, co-founder of the Safermedia charity, which campaigns for a family-friendly internet, said access to internet pornography had reached ‘crisis point’. ‘This was a wasted opportunity,’ she said. ‘The Government has taken its eye off the ball and allowed itself to be misguided by industry figures and internet users who are not parents. ‘This consultation was meant to give parents a say and make protecting children a top priority. But instead others have been able to take priority.’ Tory MP Claire Perry, who helped lead the campaign for an opt-in system, said she was ‘disappointed’ with the Government’s response. Endemic: A total of 40 per cent of parents said they knew their children had accessed online porn in a Government survey . Mrs Perry, who handed in a petition to Downing Street on the issue containing more than 115,000 names, said she was pleased that the ISPs were going to be forced to do more, saying the campaign had produced a ‘sea change’ in their attitude towards the issue. 'But she added she was ‘obviously disappointed the opt-in option has been rejected’. The Government is set to announce plans to have automatic prompts for parents reminding them to implement restrictions . The Education Department said no automatic block could filter out all harmful websites, adding that there was a danger it would breed a ‘false sense of security’ among parents. And it said a block would not deal with other online issues, such as cyber-bullying and internet grooming, which were best tackled by parents. In its formal response the department said parents have ‘just as much responsibility for keeping their children safe when they are online as when they are offline, and the basic principles of harm are the same’. Prime Minister David Cameron is said to be angry about the handling of the announcement on Friday, when no ministers were sent out to explain a package he believes will be more effective than an automatic block. A Downing Street source last night said the ‘rigorous’ package would help parents to protect their children online. Sophisticated filters will allow parents to choose the type of sites they want to restrict. The source said: ‘Under this new system, where there are children in the house, there will be an automatic prompt for parents to tailor filters to suit their child’s needs. ‘Over the coming weeks and months we will continue to talk to the industry to ensure these proposals are implemented. We want to end up with nothing less than the most rigorous system for protecting children from online dangers in the world.’ Other measures include configuring new computers to automatically prompt parents to consider imposing controls to protect children. ISPs will also be told to prompt existing customers to consider imposing restrictions.","Porn block has support of parents but ministers say no .

"She always liked to play shops when she was younger. Now schoolgirl Angel Thomas is playing the game for real - after opening her own boutique at the age of 11. The mini-entrepreneur has become Britain’s youngest shopkeeper with a business selling pet clothes and accessories. Angel Thomas is the country's youngest shopkeeper - running a pet clothing store in Liverpool . The 11-year-old balances her schoolwork with managing accounts, logging sales and promoting the site online . She runs a city centre store and balances school work with managing the accounts, processing sales and promoting her enterprise on the internet. She has just taught herself to sew and knit so she can create her own range of designer doggy fashions. ‘I’ve always wanted to be successful and run my own business,’ she said yesterday. ‘I love being my own boss and I really enjoy going to work.’ Angel has just taught herself how to sew so she can start making her own range of products . The schoolgirl recently gave her mother a prestigious 'employee of the month' award . The extraordinary enthusiasm Angel applies to her trade has produced steady sales since Pawabella opened its doors two months ago in Gostins Arcade, a collection of independent shops in a small mall in the heart of Liverpool. Every evening she rushes home from school to update her Twitter, Pinterest and Facebook accounts, checks the store’s website for orders that need to be processed and answers enquiries from customers. All her free time, holidays and weekends are spent running the shop, which she leases in the name of her mother Anita. The schoolgirl convinced her to save the money she spent on music lessons for her daughter - and to use it instead as capital for the business venture. This picture shows just some of the products the schoolgirl has on offer at her Liverpool shop . More of the fabulous doggy outfits on sale in the store. The girl doesn't plan on being in retail forever - and wants to study at University to become a vet . In return for starting the Pawabella bank account and helping behind the counter, Angel generously bestowed on her mother an ‘Employee of the Month’ award. Now the Catholic primary school pupil is looking to expand her empire to finance and fulfil her next ambition - going to university to study to become a vet. ‘It’s all I have ever wanted to do,’ she said. ‘Hopefully Pawabella will make enough money to pay for me to study. I don’t feel like I’m giving up my free time or weekends because I enjoy the work so much. My dream now is to build up stock and move into a bigger shop.’ She also plans to expand the empire by advertyising and setting up stalls at dog shows. Yesterday Anita, who has three other children, said: ‘The business is all her. She knows exactly what she wants, and how she wants things to look. I have absolutely no say in any of it - she’s very much in charge. She chooses her own stock, designs her own patterns and even designs and makes a lot of the products herself. Angel puts the final touches to the shop. She wants to build up stock and move shop in the near future . 'She works so hard and is so committed. Everyone is so proud of what she is doing. It’s great to see her really enjoying something she has created herself. She is so full of ideas. 'Her next challenge is making her own personalised dog treats and she wants to start a stall at dog shows. 'Angel has seen her older sister go to university and struggle with money, and she knows that she doesn’t want that for herself when she’s older. She wants to be able to afford to study for her dream. I’m just so proud of her.’","Angel Thomas has business selling pet clothes in the heart of Liverpool .

"Just days after reports claimed Sony is working on a smartwatch covered in e-ink material, images of its device have emerged. The Fashion-Entertainments (FES) watch is currently raising money on crowdfunding site Makuake, and was said to have been created with help from the Japanese tech giant. Sony confirmed its involvement with the startup to the Wall Street Journal, and people involved in the project admitted the tech firm's name was kept a secret to see if there was demand for the gadget. Scroll down for video . The Fashion-Entertainments (FES) watch is currently raising money on crowdfunding site Makuake, and was created with help from Sony. It features 24 design patterns that can be selected at the touch of a button, has a basic design and is said to last up to 60 days on a single button battery . This demand has been proved by the fact the campaign surpassed its fundraising goal of 2 million yen (£10,700/$17,000) in three weeks, with 140 supporters. According to the campaign page, the watch features 24 design patterns that can be selected at the touch of a button. It has a basic design and is said to last up to 60 days on a single button battery. The watch weighs 50.6g, its dial is 1.5-inch (4cm) in diameter and the case is 0.2-inches (7mm) thick. Bloomberg first reported on the rumours earlier this week when sources ‘familiar with the plans’ revealed details of an e-ink device. The report didn't reveal any more details about the watch, nor what it would look like, but said Sony was focusing more on style over substance.

It gets its name because it resembles the text and colour scheme of newspapers and books, which is why it's popular for e-readers. E-ink screens are also easier to read outdoors and in bright sunlight because they produce less glare that LCD displays. Pavel Alpeyev and Grace Huang from Bloomberg also reported that the division is working on technology that should help people make prototype devices faster. The MESH project, for example - which stands for ‘make, experience and share’ - has built a collection of sensors, LEDs and buttons into blocks that are linked wirelessly and can be controlled by a tablet. Cambridge-based Plastic Logic works with e-paper on a number of its products, including the popSlate phone case concept unveiled last year. This added a second, e-ink display to the rear of a phone that can be used to save energy when the battery runs low. In addition to saving energy, e-ink displays produce less glare meaning they can be read even in bright sunlight, which would also give it the edge over other smartwatches and phones.

"Danger: The study found that even occasional alcohol can harm egg development . Just one or two glasses of wine a week could reduce a woman’s chance of becoming pregnant by a third, say researchers. Three or more glasses cuts the odds of conception by two-thirds. Experts say even low levels of alcohol can harm the development of unfertilised eggs. The findings suggest that success can be impaired even if women stick within limits recommended by the NHS. Health workers say women trying for a baby should have no more than three small glasses of wine a week – but preferably none at all. Dr Dara Godfrey, of New York fertility clinic Reproductive Medicine Associates, carried out research on 91 women undergoing IVF treatment. She told a meeting of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine in Boston that teetotal women in the study had a 90 per cent chance of becoming pregnant. Those who drank throughout the week reduced their odds by up to 70 per cent. But binge-drinking could make the problem worse, she said. Risk: Teetotal women had a 90 per cent chance to conceive, while regular drinkers reduced their odds to 70 per cent . ‘My advice at the end of the day is to limit alcohol to very low amounts or to abstain completely,’ she said. However, Dr Allan Pacey, of the University of Sheffield, said women who rely on a regular tipple could be more stressed. Anxiety raises the levels of the hormones cortisol and adrenalin, which can impair fertility.","Results came from a testing 91 patients at a New York fertility clinic .

"Asylum seekers trying to reach Australia could be housed on Indonesia's uninhabited islands, under a plan being proposed by that country's ministers. Human rights advocated say the scheme would make those seeking asylum hostages in the country. Coordinating Political, Legal and Security Affairs Minister Tedjo Edhy Purdijatno has suggested the idea so the asylum seekers 'don't disturb the public'. Asylum seekers trying to reach Australia could be housed on Indonesia's uninhabited islands, under a plan being proposed by that country's ministers; above, a group of about 120 Australian-bound asylum seekers, mostly from Afghanistan and Iran, are evacuated by Indonesian authorities from a tanker in Marak port in April 2012 following a two-day stand-off . Suspected asylum seekers arrive at Flying Fish Cove, Christmas Island, after being intercepted and escorted in by the Australian Navy in August 2013 . Galang Island, Batam, in Indonesia's northwest, has been identified as a place to house asylum seekers . He has suggested Galang Island, Batam, in the country's northwest. The island was used to accommodate 250,000 refugees during the Vietnam War between 1979 and 1996. The asylum seekers expenses would be covered by the Indonesian government who would work alongside non-governmental organizations - such as the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR). Purdijatno is one of three senior Indonesian government ministers who have championed the plan to President Joko Widodo. The suggestion follows last week's decision by Australia's federal government to lock out asylum seekers who registered after July 1. They will also accept 150 less asylum seekers who are awaiting resettlement from Indonesia, reducing yearly numbers from 600 to 450. A boat carrying about 350 asylum seekers arrives into Christmas Island in the remote northwest of Australia in August 2001; passengers appear happy, waving out to photographers nearby .

An Australian frigate can be seen in the background as defence personnel prepare to board a boat carrying about 200 asylum seekers as they approach Christmas Island in October 2001 . According to the World Bulletin Human Rights Minister Yasonna Hamonangan Laoly said the unclear status of refugees or asylum seekers would make them hostages in the country. He said: 'It is the right [policy] for Australia, but it will weigh on us,' said Laoly. Indonesia's Minister of Foreign Affairs Retno LP Marsudi says the plan goes against the Convention on Refugees and Indonesia's international duty. He said: 'If the responsibility to resolve the problem only burdens transit countries, then it is not fair.' In April 2014 the United Nations refugee agency in Jakarta reported that there were about 10,000 asylum seekers and refugees in Indonesia, the majority from the Middle East. The majority are Muslims hoping to move to Australia. Meanwhile, waves of refugees and asylum seekers from Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, Iraq and Myanmar continue to flow in. Most have travelled across continents in crowded leaky boats that are liable to capsize.","An island used to accommodate refugees during Vietnam War suggested .

"Laughing all the way to the bank: Barclays executive Rich Ricci . While most of us were worrying about whether  the Budget would leave us worse off, there was one man in no doubt that things had just got even better. Barclays revealed yesterday that top ‘casino banker’ Rich Ricci had received a staggering £18million windfall. And the jackpot was just one share of an astonishing £40million bonus payout split between nine Barclays executives. But the bank provoked outrage for slipping out the announcement on the same day as the Chancellor delivered his austerity Budget – to pay for an economic crisis caused by bank bosses. Still, the Budget cuts must have seemed like small change to the flamboyant Ricci, who owns 11 horses which raced at Cheltenham Festival last week. They include Champagne Fever, which earned him a £68,340 bonus by winning the opening race, and the provocatively named Fatcatinthehat. In all, Ricci and his wife Susannah own 30 horses with Ireland’s champion trainer Willie Mullins, and have won £588,125 in prize money this season. They are said to travel to Dublin by private jet most weekends to watch the horses train. Ricci, who is worth an estimated £57million, was a key lieutenant of disgraced former Barclays boss Bob Diamond. The 49-year-old has managed to cling on to his job despite jointly running the investment bank when Barclays was fined £290million for rigging Libor interest rates last summer. Yesterday’s jackpot, of £17.6million in shares from awards dating back over the past three years, is just the latest in a long line of big wins for Ricci, who also received £9.7million in share bonuses last year and cashed in a £40million pay and share package in 2010. The bank’s directors, including Ricci, chief executive Antony Jenkins and finance chief Chris Lucas, all gave up their bonuses for last year’s work after the bank was rocked by a string of scandals. Row: Senior Barclays staff, many of whom are based here in London, received £40million in payouts today, the bank announced . But this week they were handed giant share bonuses awarded from previous years. It included a huge windfall for Jenkins, who has called for restraint on pay and promised to overhaul the bank’s culture. In addition to the £2.6million he was paid for his work last year, he received awards worth £5.6million. Critics accused Barclays of using the ‘lowest form of corporate trickery’ to bury unwelcome news by revealing the ‘grotesque’ bonus figures on Budget day. Deborah Hargreaves of the High Pay Centre, a think-tank which monitors income distribution, said: ‘Just after we’ve seen one of the bleakest Budgets in modern times, Barclays is showing its insensitivity by engaging in the lowest form of corporate trickery.’ Len McCluskey, general secretary of trade union Unite, said Barclays had made ‘a complete mockery of any claims banks are cleaning up their acts’. He added: ‘On the day the Chancellor cruelly demands more austerity from working people, to pay for an economic crisis caused by bank bosses, Barclays bury the news that senior bankers are pocketing millions.’ Winning the race: Banker Ricci, who is worth an estimated £57 million has a total of 11 horses competing at Cheltenham Festival this year (file photo) Taking the lead: Champagne Fever, in the lead, won the first race of the Cheltenham Festival yesterday, making an already rich Rich Ricci richer . David Hillman, spokesman for the Robin Hood Tax campaign group, said: ‘A scandal-hit bank attempting to bury news of its grotesque rewards on Budget day is hardly evidence of a reformed financial sector. 'This tells you all you need to know – banks cannot be trusted to put their own house in order.’ Barclays was the first bank to be fined for rigging Libor interest rates and is facing a £270million fine from US regulators for manipulating energy prices. It also set aside £1.6billion last year to compensate customers mis-sold payment protection insurance. Despite this, more of its staff received ‘millionaire’ pay packages last year than any bank in the UK – with 428 scooping more than £1million. Barclays insisted last night that  it had not tried to bury the news  of its payouts and had decided when it would release the information before the date for the Budget was set in December. A spokesman added: ‘The share releases include deferred shares awarded from previous years’ annual performance bonuses.’ Winning streak: Ricci with his horse Champagne Fever at Cheltenham .","Barclays executive Rich Ricci was also given a £6m bonus last month .

"Campaigner: Conservative MP Claire Perry . Children are being scarred for life by stumbling across internet pornography before their brains are able to cope with it, according to a leading neuroscientist. Dr William Struthers told MPs that in eight out of ten cases, youngsters come across hard-core images by accident. If they are between nine and 14, when their bodies are becoming sexually mature but their brains are not emotionally developed, early exposure can lead to lasting damage including withdrawn behaviour and acting out what they see onscreen. Dr Struthers was speaking at a House  of Commons seminar sponsored by  Claire Perry, the Tory MP who wants to block web porn from computers unless adults ‘opt in’. The American academic’s remarks came as the Daily Mail continues its campaign for a limit on the unregulated flow of internet porn into homes. Dr Struthers, an expert in sexual arousal who researches the impact of pornography on young people, said: ‘When asked to recall their first exposure, most individuals will say it was accidental, unintentional and inadvertent. ‘A typical story would be a young lad who is sent a link to a website by a school friend as a prank. ‘The website may have a perfectly innocent-sounding name and the boy logs on. Even though he didn’t give his consent, he then sees images he didn’t want to see. It’s in this way that children’s minds are being violated. You can’t “un-see” something. These images are not easily erasable and become almost tattooed on the cortex. It is a powerful shock to the system.’ Accident: Dr William Struthers told MPs that in eight out of ten cases, youngsters come across hard-core images by accident . Dr Struthers, associate professor of psychology at Wheaton College, Illinois, found that research subjects were able to recall the first images of porn they ever saw in remarkable detail even though they could not remember images they had seen more recently. He said that impact was profound because although the hypothalamus – the region of the brain which controls sexual development – is preparing the body for sexual maturity, the higher thinking regions of the brain are not developed enough to deal with viewing extreme sex. ‘They feel aroused but they don’t know how to make sense of that,’ he said. ‘This creates a sense of unease that they have done something wrong. On top of that, 80 per cent will never talk to anyone about what they have seen. They don’t get the benefit of adult sexual maturity to help process this information.’ While not all will be affected, for vulnerable children porn can be the ‘straw that breaks the camel’s back’ which tips them into becoming withdrawn and antisocial. ‘As they are exposed to more porn, their self-confidence goes down because they feel inadequate and their use of sexually explicit material goes up. The American academic's remarks came as the Daily Mail continues its campaign for a limit on the unregulated flow of internet porn into homes . They become more socially isolated and have more difficulties forming attachments with care-givers.’ Neuroscientists have found  that sexual images make such a deep impact because the brain is wired to search them out, in the same way as it is wired to pick out human faces. Furthermore Dr Struthers says research is finding that children are copying pornographic behaviour. Simply viewing explicit images online makes them more likely to act out what they see. When the human eye sees an activity it has not seen before, it triggers brain cells called ‘mirror neurons’ which start working out how it is done. Dr Struthers explained: ‘If your attitudes are already becoming more permissive because of your pornography use, it could then become something you try out.’ Dr Struthers told MPs there is now ‘a broad consensus’ among academics from every discipline that pornography is changing  the way children behave. He said studies have found that porn is an ‘accelerant’ which brings down the age at which young people first have sex. Overall, Dr Struthers believes the easy availability of porn is creating a generation growing up with the belief that sex is ‘a recreational commodity primarily for entertainment’. He welcomed British moves towards an opt-in system for home computers, which has been championed by the Daily Mail’s Block Online Porn campaign. The proposal for a default block, now under consideration by  David Cameron, would not only limit the amount of material allowed into homes, he added,  but would also give parents the incentive to discuss the subject with their children.","Dr William Struthers told MPs that in eight out of ten cases, youngsters come across hard-core images by accident ."
"Labour last night threw its weight behind the Daily Mail’s campaign for an automatic block on online porn. An ‘opt-in’ system, under which access is blocked unless adults specifically say they want to see sexual content, would be a ‘sensible’ way forward, the shadow ministers for media and justice declared. They say the measure is necessary to prevent children falling victim to a ‘modern-day form of pollution’. Porn fears: Just 30% of parents of porn-watching children knew they had accessed adult material . The argument for an opt-in system is underlined by a large study demonstrating that most parents have no idea what their children are looking at on the internet. Among parents of children who had admitted to researchers that they had looked at adult content, more than two thirds were certain their child had not, or said they did not know. In addition, more than a quarter of children admitted ignoring warnings their parents gave them about harmful material on the internet. The Government is resisting the call for an ‘opt-in’ system, preferring a less stringent ‘opt-out’ system, whereby users are asked when they set up their internet access whether they wish to have a filter applied. But this might apply only to new subscribers to internet service providers (ISPs), and would rely on parents being responsible and proactive enough to ask for access to be blocked. It could also allow children to answer the one-off question themselves if they see it on the computer first. In their article, above, shadow media minister Helen Goodman and shadow justice minister Jenny Chapman say this plan does not go nearly far enough. And they say that David Cameron’s closeness to internet giant Google means that the Coalition is too ‘weak’ to act, concluding: ‘The Prime Minister should not put his cronies before the children of this country’. An all-party group of MPs, led by the Conservative Claire Perry, launched the campaign for an opt-in system last week, saying increasing numbers of teenagers were growing up addicted to porn. The Daily Mail wants the Government to unveil a consultation on an opt-in system, and in the meantime to speed up the roll-out of ‘opt-out’ filtering systems to internet users. Miss Goodman and Mrs Chapman say action is urgently needed because ‘children are regularly seeing pornography and sometimes being groomed for sex’. They attack Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt’s proposal, which involves asking the four major ISPs to offer new customers the chance to opt out of access to pornography. They argue it would be 2017 before the proportion of households included reached 90 per cent. They deny claims that an opt-in system would be an attack on civil liberties. A London School of Economics study has found that of children who told the researchers that they had seen sexual images, 40 per cent of their parents said they were certain their child had not, and 29 per cent said they did not know. Just 30 per cent knew that their child had seen porn online. And 26 per cent of children said they ignored their parents’ warnings on internet safety. Opt-in: Labour threw its weight behind the Daily Mail's campaign for an automatic block on online porn . The study added that middle-class children were more likely to access porn online than those from poorer backgrounds, because they are more likely to have computers in their own rooms. Study leader Sonia Livingstone said: ‘I think that parents can be quite embarrassed to ask about anything sexual that children encounter on the internet. ‘What they should do is find a way to have a conversation with their children so it seems like sharing, not snooping.’ She found that 22 per cent of boys aged 13 to 16 and 13 per cent of girls had seen sexual images online. And 2 per cent of 11- to 16-year-olds said they had seen violent sexual images. A spokesman for Google said: ‘Laws alone can’t teach kids to cross the road. The same is true of learning to be safe online. We work with government and child safety organisations to promote sensible legislation, and have developed technology, including Google Safe Search and the Family Safety Centre, that parents can use to protect their children online. We all have a role to play.’ by JENNY CHAPMAN and HELEN GOODMAN . Ashleigh Hall was 17 when she was lured to her death by 32-year-old convicted rapist Peter Chapman. Although a registered sex offender, he was able to use Facebook to persuade Ashleigh to meet him, and went on to rape and murder her. Chapman pretended to be a teenage boy and told Ashleigh his father would pick her up in his car. His grooming took place over several weeks. Lured to death: Peter Chapman, 32, raped and murdered Ashleigh Hall, 17, right, after grooming her online . This is one of many stories that demonstrates that currently we don’t have the right safety precautions online for our children. The police, parents, schools, internet and website providers and young people themselves all need to take their share of responsibility. In government Labour said we would give the industry another chance to tackle the problems on a voluntary basis. But we warned that if this didn’t produce significant improvements we would step in. More than two years on, as last week’s all-party report shows, things have got worse. Children are regularly seeing pornography and sometimes being groomed for sex. Jeremy Hunt is trying to persuade us that his ‘Active Choice’ policy is enough. Under this, four major internet service providers (ISPs) offer new customers the opportunity to opt out of access to pornography. The problem is that this scheme will not reach many customers straight away, and won’t even hit the 90 per cent mark until 2017. In the meantime sales of TVs with internet access are rising and expected to overtake conventional TVs next year. Then even more children will be one click from the strongest material. This is why the All Party Group’s recommendation that the ISPs are required to move to an opt-in system for adults to see pornography is sensible. We know this is possible: it is the technology schools use and the way O2 will operate its wifi during the Olympics. Currently, most of the ISPs require customers who want to put filters on to their computers to download the software themselves. Backing online porn opt in: Labour MPs Jenny Chapman, Shadow Minister for Justice, and Helen Goodman, Shadow Minister for Culture, Media and Sport . But most of us are not geeks – and when one of us tried, all that happened was that the computer was disabled for 24 hours! The problem Ashleigh faced was that the anonymity of the web gave cover to a sex offender. At no point was he asked to register his IP or email address with police. He was never asked to disclose his online identity and his use of the net was completely unchecked. It’s not just our law enforcers who need to monitor the online activities of sex offenders, Facebook refuses to act too. They have resisted calls to install a panic button for users who become suspicious of the true identities or behaviour of other users. Social networking sites need to step up and become full partners in the battle to keep our children safe online. Righting these wrongs is not an attack on civil liberties. Adults will still have the choice to access material they want to see. But in a civilised society we must also protect our children. What we want to see is the same balance of rights and responsibilities as we have in the real world. Undoubtedly, doing this would cost the industry some money – and not just putting in place new filters. The search engines such as Google sell advertising on the back of the number of hits any website gets, so the more hits (and porn sites get plenty) the more they can charge for advertising spots. Of course it is the Government’s job to encourage business, but this is not the same as ignoring the needs and wants of ordinary people. Some 80 per cent of people (and 93 per cent of women) think this is a problem. Children accessing porn on the net is a modern-day form of pollution. In 1959 the Tories introduced the Clean Air Act to cut harmful pollution from old smoke stack industries. Are they now too weak to act and hold the ring between powerful vested interests and ordinary people? We saw on Tuesday at the Leveson Inquiry how Jeremy Hunt was prepared to do Murdoch’s bidding and we fear the Government has got into the same weak position with Google and the ISPs. Mr Cameron employed Steve Hilton, whose wife is a top executive at Google. But he has failed to answer the questions we have put to him about Mr Hilton’s conflict of interest and influence on policy. The Prime Minister should not put his cronies before the children of this country. ■ Jenny Chapman is MP for Darlington and Shadow Minister for Justice.

"It’s great fun to fly off on holiday  every now and then, but as any health professional will tell you, an airplane cabin is not a healthy environment. Any time in the sky, from a couple of hours to  a whole day or more when crossing  multiple time zones is, for the human body, a real challenge. Aside from the cabin pressure, dry air, and sitting squashed in one place while a small child uses the back of your seat as a punch bag, there are a host of unpleasant things that happen to your body while you’re travelling. Scroll down for video . Jet lag isn't the only thing flyers have to worry about when travelling at 30,000ft... There are a host of unpleasant things that happen to your body while you’re travelling, not least a cold head . Frequent flyers can be susceptible to a host of health problems, from cardiovascular disease and cancer, to vision and hearing problems, even mental disorders and cognitive decline. On that cheery note, MailOnline Travel has compiled a list of health horrors to watch out for next time you’re thousands of feet up in the sky… . Sickness . The increased risk of catching a cold is more than 100 times higher on a plane according to the Journal of Environmental Health Research. A recent study showed that when you sneeze on a plane - unless you catch it in the crook of your arm - airborne particles can travel up to 50 feet, dispersing in all directions around the cabin due to plane airflow. More serious disease risks include catching food-borne illnesses on the flight such as E Coli or Salmonella – although these could be caught anywhere. Excuse me a moment... Being sick on board is just one of many rather unpleasant things that can happen. And it's not so good if you're the one being sick either . Deep Vein Thrombosis . There’s a reason those funny looking flight socks are popular. A very well-known risk during air travel is developing leg clots or DVT, which kills thousands of people every year. Long periods of immobility increase the risk as sitting and leg room are cramped. Dehydration and low cabin pressure are also contributors, according to the American Heart Association. Be active. The only thing that gets that blood from the lower body back up to the heart is muscle contraction, so move around and flex those leg muscles regularly. Tastebuds also take a battering while in the sky, which is why food doesn't taste as good mid-air . Breathing difficulties . The pressure in an airplane cabin at cruising altitude may make you feel like you are high in the mountains. There's less oxygen available which puts an added load on a system trying to get the required amount of oxygen into the bloodstream. And while our usual home environment has a humidity level of about 35 per cent, on a plane it’s below 25 per cent, which may also disturb breathing. Hearing problems . During any flight that’s more than four hours, depending on where you are sitting, you are at the threshold for exposing yourself to hearing loss - and the more you fly, the greater the risk. The occupational safety limit set by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is 88 decibels for four hours and 85 decibels for eight hours, while noise on a plane usually ranges between 95 and 105 decibels, and engine noise during take-off is usually upward of 115 decibels. Why did I sit so far back? Passengers who tend to sit near the engines for long periods of time are more at risk of developing long term hearing problems . Passengers stuck in the noisier part at the back of the plane are at an even greater risk for hearing loss than flight attendants who have the freedom to move around. On the upside, noise-reducing headphones can cut noise by up to 40 decibels. Reduction in taste . A 2010 study by Lufthansa revealed that passengers’ ability to taste salty and sweet can drop by as much as 30 percent in-flight. This is because plane air dries out the mucous membranes in your mouth. The solution? Stay hydrated, and stick to sour, bitter, and spicy foods, tastes that are much less affected. Jet lag . Medically referred to as 'desynchronosis' and classified as a circadian rhythm sleep disorder, jet lag is part and parcel of long haul flights. After all, the human body wasn't designed to leave Washington DC on a Wednesday night and arrive in the UK seven hours later. Short-term problems from jet lag include fatigue, loss of concentration, irritability and loss of appetite. More worryingly, a study published in The Lancet in 2007 found that consistent disruption of body rhythms could lead to cognitive decline, psychotic and mood disorders and possibly heart disease and cancer. Make sure you brush your teeth during a flight to avoid the dreaded bad breath . Radiation . On most international flights, you are exposed to a not entirely insignificant dose of radiation from cosmic rays, which are energetic particles from space. The longer the flight and  the higher and closer you fly to the North Pole, the greater the dose. On a round trip flight from Washington, DC, to Beijing, for example, you can easily exceed the dose you would get from a chest X-ray. Scientists say  for the average tourist the levels are too low to worry about, but frequent flyers might want to find out more about what levels they are exposed to. In the words of one UK scientist ‘cosmic radiation should not be ignored.’ Constipation . All that sitting causes your metabolic rate and digestion to slow, and causes gas, bloating, and constipation. Suggestions to avoid it include cutting down on your calorie intake and twist from side to side in your seat to help everything keep moving, while the best way to combat dehydration is simple: Drink a lot of water, and avoid alcohol and caffeine. Wandering around the plane can help combat conditions such as DVT . But don't even think of drinking water unless it's bottled - Environmental Protection Agency research once revealed that 15 percent of the water on planes contained fecal matter. Some people advise not using water from the bathroom tap even to wash your hands after going to the loo. But if you do, make sure you use plenty of soap. Best of all, use antibacterial wipes. But worst of all… . Bad Breath . Many of your body’s systems slow down when flying, including saliva production, which allows bacteria to flourish. Food particles left in the mouth produce a sulphur compound and cause bad breath, and over-doing it with sugary drinks, fast food, and sweets also encourages halitosis. Just as you would at home, eat healthily, drink water and brush your teeth.","MailOnline Travel reveals how flying can affect your health .

"Waslia Umaru, 14, has admitted killing her 35-year-old husband Umaru Sani and three of his friends by putting rat poison in their food after she was forced to marry him last week . A child bride forced into marriage in Nigeria killed her husband and three of his friends by lacing a meal with rat poison, police said. Wasila Umaru, 14, was married last week to 35-year-old Umaru Sani, according to assistant superintendent Musa Magaji Majia. But when Umaru invited a dozen friends to celebrate in northern Ungwar Yansoro village, near the city of Kano, the teenager slipped the deadly chemical into a rice dish. Umaru died the same day along with friends Nasiru Mohammed and Alhassan Alhassan, while another female victim, Indo Ibrahim, died in hospital hospital while receiving treatment. Wasila admitted buying the poison at a local market and putting it into the food. 'The suspect confessed to committing the crime and said she did it because she was forced to marry a man she did not love,' Majia said. Umaru is cooperating with police and likely will be charged with culpable homicide, according to Majia. Child marriage is common in Nigeria and especially in the mainly Muslim and impoverished north, where the numbers increase in times of drought because a bride price is paid and it means one less mouth to feed. Fifty percent of Nigerian girls living in rural areas are married before they turn 18, according to the U.N. children's agency. Child brides suffer difficult pregnancies and can often die in childbirth, the leading cause of death worldwide for girls aged 15 to 19. They are also much more likely to contract AIDS and be subjected to domestic violence, according to the International Center for Research on Women. Early and forced marriage is classified . as modern-day slavery by the U.N. labor organization, and Nigeria's . Child Rights Act prohibits marriage before 18. Wasila admitted to putting the poison in a rice dish which killed her husband and three of his friends . But the ruling is often ignored in favour of Islamic Shariah law that holds in most northern states. No one in Nigeria has been prosecuted for marrying a child, including Sen. Sani Ahmed Yerima, infamous for divorcing a 17-year-old that he married when she was 15. Yerima got the divorce so he could marry a 14-year-old Egyptian girl in 2010, when he was 49. He had to divorce one of his child brides because Islamic law allows a maximum of four wives at a time. Many child brides are divorced to make way for another partner, and because of incontinence and other medical problems caused by difficulties during childbirth pregnancies. According to local child rights advocates who say such girls are put out on the street.","Wasila Umaru, 14, married to Umaru Sani, 35, a week ago .

"A brave kayaker takes a 60ft plunge down a massive waterfall in Mexico. Quebec-born Emrick Blanchette, who has been paddling for five years, travelled to the Tlapacoyan Veracruz region of the country to experience its high number of vertical drops. But the experienced athlete admitted that he was apprehensive when going over Tomata Falls - which is more than 60ft high. Brake kayaker, Emrick Blanchette, filmed himself going over a massive waterfall in Mexico . He said: 'I was pretty nervous at the top, scouting and visualising my line. 'I had seen a lot of people landing near-flat or over-flipping on video. 'The lip is kind of tricky as it is angled at almost 90 degrees. So every little movement, stroke and body position will have an influence on your line and landing angle. An experienced athlete, Emrick admitted he was nervous to take on Tomata Falls - which has a 60 foot drop . Every stroke, movement and body position has an influence on whether or not Emrick would be successful . 'Once I was in my boat, a big part of the stress went away and I knew I could stick it.' The 23-year-old, who is part of kayaking team Quebec Connection, also tackled a number of other big drops during the trip. And Blanchette was keen to stress the importance of having an experienced and trustworthy crew when tackling such dangerous waterfalls. 'I was pretty nervous at the top, scouting and visualising my line,' he said . Emrick believes another key to success is travelling and filming with a crew of people that you can trust . He added: 'The big parts are safety and filming. 'Personally, I think the best thing when running steep rapids or big drops is to be with a crew of people you trust. 'This way you can share thoughts about the line and you make sure you have friends you can trust for setting safety or if anything goes wrong.'","Emrick Blanchette films himself going over Tomata Falls .

"A parting school of fish allow an exploring snorkeller to swim amongst them. The amazing scene, which was taken in the clear blue waters off the Philippines coastline, shows how fish work in unison. Diver Whitney De Neef delved into the colony while her husband Steve photographed her adventures from above. Stunning sight! Snorkeler Whitney De Neef dove into a colony of fish off the coast of the Philippines . Whitney's husband Steve, a photojournalist, snapped the images from the surface of the water . The couple, who live in the Philippines but are originally from Antwerp, Belgium, were there on holiday while Steve worked on a story about sea cows - or Dugongs. However, he took a day off to spend with Whitney on a small island called Dimakya, which they spent exploring the fish in the clear water. Photojournalist Steve, 33, said: 'We were there partly for a holiday and partly for work. 'I was there to do a story on Dugongs that still frequent the area and my wife joined me just to enjoy the island. 'My favourite picture is the one where my wife, the snorkeler, is right in the centre of the school of jacks. 'I love it because the school of fish just opened right up every time she would dive down. It's amazing to see all these fish move together.' The couple, who live in the Philippines, were exploring a small island called Dimakya and its nearby water . 'My favourite picture is the one where my wife is right in the centre of the school of jacks,' Steve says . Steve, who met Whitney in the Philippines in 2010 while she worked as a volunteer in an orphanage, was formerly a diving instructor. He added: 'Whitney was amazed by this school of jacks and how close they were to the beach. 'She wants to go back. I think she was more excited swimming with these fish then I was photographing them. Steve estimates that there were over a thousand fish in the school and were so close, you could touch them . 'They were very close, you could basically touch them. The fish just all hung around the whole time we were in the water. 'It's very hard to tell but there must have been over a thousand. 'The underwater world always amazes me and big schools of fish like this are incredible to watch.

"People who carry a lot of fat around their middles are three and a half times more likely to develop memory loss and dementia in old age, research shows. Scientists have found that people with a lot of abdominal fat have lower levels of the protein that also controls how the liver metabolises fat. Called PPARalpha, it controls fat metabolism in the liver, but . it also resides in the brain’s memory centre – the hippocampus – and . controls memory and learning. People who carry a lot of fat around their middles are three and a half times more likely to develop memory loss and dementia in old age . When people are overweight, they initially just have depleted PPARalpha levels in their livers but eventually in their whole bodies, including their brains. Neurological scientists at the Rush University Medical Centre, in Chicago, in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health, believe their finding could lead to the development of an injection to improve learning and memory in people with dementia. Dr Kalipada Pahan from Rush University Medical Centre said: ‘We need to better understand how fat is connected to memory and learning so that we can develop effective approach to protect memory and learning. ‘While PPARalpha deficient mice are poor in learning and memory, injection of PPARα to the hippocampus improves learning and memory.’ Dr Pahan said: ‘Further research must be conducted to see how we could potentially maintain normal PPARalpha in the brain in order to be resistant to memory loss.’ Researchers found people with a lot of abdominal fat have lower levels of the nuclear regulator PPARalpha in their livers and brains making them 3.6 times more likely to develop dementia . The research was published in the journal Cell Reports. Previous research has suggested that passive smoking, sleep apnoea, drinking and taking drugs, type 2 diabetes and heart disease can all also increase a person's risk of dementia. Dementia currently affects about 800,000 people in the UK.","People with lots of abdominal fat have lower levels of a protein called PPARalpha in their brains and livers - increasing the risk of memory loss .

"For her entire life, Jade Jacob-Brooks never existed. There is no paper trail to confirm her place on earth because there was no proof that she was ever born. She's never driven a car, voted, had a bank account, or picked up a parcel from the post office... She's never even had a holiday tan. But the 20-year-old  has become a born-again citizen, after a lifelong battle to get a birth certificate. I exist! Jade Jacobs-Brooks has never been able to drive, travel abroad, vote, open a bank account, get a job, or a flat, and or even pick up a parcel from the post office . She was born in Spain while her parents were on holiday but was never given a birth certificate by the Spanish hospital. Instead she was handed paperwork by the Spanish hospital so she could come home - but was told by British authorities it wasn’t enough for her birth to be registered. It means she has not officially existed for the last 20 years - and has had no way of proving who she really is. When her friends started clubbing and drinking in pubs she had to stay at home because she had no ID. Cute: Jade's parents were told they had been given the correct documentation by the Spanish hospital, but when they returned to England the UK registrars refused to accept the details as proof of birth . Jade missed school trips and was even stayed at home alone when the rest of her family have gone on holidays abroad together. In a moment of desperation she wrote to the Queen asking for help, but was told the matter was 'not a human rights issue'. But lawyers disagreed and launched a four-and-a-half-year campaign to get her a birth certificate. Jade told how she can’t wait to go on holiday, adding: 'I want a real tan - I’m fed up with fake tans. I am going to go on holiday with the money I have been saving.' Jade, who hopes to work as an administrator in the City of London, said: 'It’s been incredibly frustrating. Finally: The 20-year-old has now become a born-again citizen, after finally being given a birth certificate . 'My mum and dad thought they had the right papers to register me in the UK. But when they were translated they were told they had the wrong paperwork. 'We were told it wasn’t my right to . have a birth certificate. But how can that be when not having one means I . cannot do things that everyone else can? 'The government were so unhelpful - they just didn’t want to know.' She . added: 'My 18th birthday was not the big landmark that other people’s . were. Everyone was going to bars and clubs but I couldn’t go because I . didn’t have any identification. 'It has been very upsetting and such a long time to wait.' Jade, . from Harlow, Essex, was born in Alicante, Spain, on September 25, 1991, . while her parents Linda Jacobs, 60, and Victor Brooks, 56, a porter, . were on holiday.

But when they returned to England the UK registrars refused to accept the details as proof of birth. Without . a valid Spanish birth certificate Jade has never been able to register . her birth in the United Kingdom, or apply for a passport. Her . father Victor returned to Alicante when Jade was a toddler to confront . Spanish officials in person - but they told him the hospital had no . record of his daughter’s birth. Luckily Jade was given a place at school and then at college and her mother Linda was able to persuade the Government to pay child benefit for her. But when Jade was a teenager her lack of proof of birth and ID started to become a bigger problem. First she was refused a Saturday job at a supermarket then she was left with no way apply for university funding. With lack of ID creating a growing number of problems, her family wrote to the government, MPs and even the Queen for help with no avail. But after a four-and-a-half-year battle by international law firm Allen and Overy Jade has finally been given a Spanish birth certificate. Jade’s mother Linda said: 'We are so pleased for Jade.

"A non-stick surface that can repel liquids has been developed using tiny 'umbrellas' to increase the surface area of a structure. Previously, liquid-repellent waterproof surfaces relied on plastic coatings such as Teflon, which degrade at higher temperatures. However the new method makes the surface of a material ‘rough’ in order to prevent water resting on the surface - and could have a variety of uses from surgery to electronic circuits. Scroll down for video . University of California scientists have developed a super-repellent material. It uses 'umbrellas' a fifth the width of human hair to increase surface area. This prevents a variety of liquids including water, methanol and solvents like FC-72 (all shown above) from sticking to the surface . The research, published in the journal Science, was carried out by a team of scientists at the University of California. Their method involves etching surfaces, in this case silica, with tiny structures to make them resemble a ‘bed of nails’. Each nail head  measures a mere 20 micrometers across, which is about one fifth the width of a human hair, and limits the surface area that liquids can contact with. This means that when a liquid comes into contact with the surface, instead of spreading out, it remains as a droplet - a property known as ‘superomniphobic’. Back in July a company called Impervious revealed their spray that can make any device waterproof. The nanospray contains molecules 1,000 times smaller than a human hair, but each molecule is super hydrophobic - making anything it is sprayed onto water-resistant. It can be sprayed onto the screen of any device, or can be used to waterproof the entire gadget. The thin layer of protection it provides also prevents the screen from being scratched. When applied, the firm claims gadgets can be submerged in three feet (one metre) of water for 30 minutes. Each head of the nails is also undercut, resembling an umbrella, which stops liquid from seeping into the gaps between them. On this engineered surface, even completely wetting liquids roll around like a ball and slide right off when the surface is tilted. What what’s more, as the surfaces don’t use a coating they can survive high temperatures - up to 1,000°C (1,830°F). And the material isn’t just repellent to water but also liquids with a much lower surface tension, known as fluorinated solvents. Of the numerous touted uses, the surface could be used for medical instruments so that blood and other fluids do not adhere to them. It could also be used in electronic circuits to prevent them being vulnerable to wet weather. ‘Usually artificial surfaces repel water because of the chemical composition of the material, but in our case, the repulsion is completely by mechanical means,’ study co-author Dr Chang-Jin Kim told Live Science. The effect can also be used on other materials such as mental, tungsten and plastic. For now, though, the process to make the structures is quite impressive, although the researchers said the technique could be mass-produced. The researchers said it could be capable of lasting a long time in an outdoor environment, such as on buildings or vehicles, because its repelling properties would not degrade from ultraviolet light exposure and extreme temperatures. And it could improve biomedical devices because its repelling properties would not degrade because of damage from biofluids. Methanol is seen here beading on the hydrophobic material (right) as compared to Teflon on the left. ‘Usually artificial surfaces repel water because of the chemical composition of the material, but in our case, the repulsion is completely by mechanical means,’ said study co-author Dr Chang-Jin Kim .

"Shoppers were sent into a frenzy after fearing a 'gunman' had opened fire during a Black Friday brawl as bargain-hunters continued to cause chaos. Fights continued to break out across the country on the biggest shopping day of the year - depsite some stores saying it has been 'quieter than usual'. Customers in the Westfield Annapolis Mall in Maryland panicked after hearing loud bangs and windows smashing - fearing someone had started shooting. According to WJLA there was a fight in the food court that saw tables overturned. Anne Arundel County Police responded and the mall was put on shut down. Scroll down for videos .

However the mall reopened a short time later, allowing shoppers to continue their hunt for cut-price gifts. Elsewhere desperate shoppers were seen fighting over the last toy in a Fischer Price while others scrapped over barbie dolls and widescreen TVs. In Great Bend, Kansas, a group of grown men held onto the final Power Wheel in the toy store in a bid to take it home. A video shows one woman told one of the men to let the box go before a security guard intervened - saying none of those tugging at the item were allowed to buy it. In Unicoi, Tennessee, a crowd were huddled round a bin of barbie dolls passing them back to friends and family members behind them. A video obtained by WJHL shows the deal hunters shouting as they push others aside to grab the figurines. Police in Central Valley, New York, also arrested a father who allegedly left his young children alone inside a hotel so that his wife could finish her Black Friday shopping. Toru Sakaguchi was placed in custody after his four-year-old son was seen walking around the hallways of the Hampton Inn in Central Valley at around 4am on Friday. According to ABC 7, the child told police where his room was and when they opened the door, there was an 11-year-old handicapped girl inside. Sakaguchi told police that he left his children alone at around 3 a.m. so that he could pick up his wife from the Woodbury Common Premium Outlets, but he had to wait over an hour for her to be done shopping. A security guard eventually intervenes and tells the group that none of them can purchase the toy . According to NBC New York, two people were slashed with box cutters in separate incidents in suburban stores. A Costco employee in Nanuet, Rockland County, stabbed another with a box cutter shortly before the store opened for business Friday while an 18-year-old was targeted outside the Tanger Outlet Mall in Riverhead, on Long Island. As many as 96 million shoppers were expected to hit the streets on Friday, but mall crowds were relatively thin and workers reported fewer shoppers - in a sign that the mad rush is happening the night of Thanksgiving and more consumers are picking up deals online. 'We've been really slow now,' Janelle Martin, a mall worker in St Petersburg, Florida, told WTSP on Friday. 'I don't feel like it's Black Friday…because Black Friday is when you shop. It doesn't count when you come in on Thanksgiving at 6 o'clock.' Most major retailers now open their doors Thursday evening and offer extended holiday deals rather than limiting them to one day. The result is a quieter experience on what has traditionally been the busiest, and sometimes most chaotic, shopping day of the year.

"Police are refusing to release the audio tape of a 13-minute, 911 call made by a woman who was  shot dead, allegedly by her husband, while she was still on the phone. Authorities are investigating whether Denver officers responded quickly enough to the call made by Kristen Kirk, 44, on Monday night at her home just a mile from the police station. A homicide detective who listened to the 911 call said he could hear her scream and then gunfire, according to court documents. Officers arrived just after the shooting and found Mrs Kirk, a mother of three sons, dead of a gunshot wound to the head. Kristine Kirk (pictured left) was allegedly shot dead by her husband Richard Kirk (right) on Monday. She spent 13 minutes on a 911 call before she was shot in the head . However, four exchanges between police and dispatchers were released, according to the Denver Post. Police dispatch alerted two officers about the incident at the Kirk family home at 9.32pm on Monday. After ten minutes, officers were still en route to the home and reading the dispatcher's notes from Mrs Kirk's conversation on his laptop. Following Mrs Kirk's screams and a gunshot, the line went silent. The dispatcher then says: 'Code 10' - the alert to a possible shooting. One of the officers asks the dispatcher to get Mrs Kirk back on the phone to which the dispatcher responds: 'Technically, she's still on the line.' At 9.47pm, an officer radios from the home to say that they have arrived and three minutes later calls for an ambulance saying there is a victim with gunshot wounds. He adds: 'We're going to need homicide.' On Wednesday, a judge ordered her husband, Richard . Kirk, 47, held without bond after his first court appearance. Kirk wore a grey jail uniform and showed no emotion. He faces first-degree murder charges and was being represented by a public defender, who declined to comment. Police . officials said their internal investigation will focus on the time it . took for officers to respond to the home and whether dispatchers . properly prioritized the woman's call, which is characterized in court . paperwork as a 'domestic disturbance'. Denver . police have struggled with slowing response times in recent months as . the department's ranks have shrunk due to retirements, departures and . budget cuts. Kristine . Kirk told dispatchers that her husband was 'talking about the end of . the world, and he wanted her to shoot him,' the documents say. She said . he was hallucinating and scaring the couple's three young boys. She . told a call-taker there was a gun in the house but it was in a safe. Dispatchers asked her a series of questions about her husband's medical . history and possible drug use. Authorities investigate the homicide at the family's Denver home but refused to release Mrs Kirk's 911 call . As the call continued, she said her husband retrieved the weapon and she began to scream, according to the documents. Police said she was shot about 12 to 13 minutes into the call. Officials have refused to release the 911 call or dispatch records, citing the open investigation. 'Any time a person dies while communicating with Denver's emergency services we examine the circumstances to ensure that the incident was handled properly and we look for areas to improve upon,' Sonny Jackson, a department spokesman, said in a statement. He also said detectives are investigating whether Richard Kirk used marijuana before the shooting 'based on evidence we found at the scene'. His father, also Richard Kirk, said the family is shocked, as the couple had shown no signs of marital distress. He visited the family in January and was unaware of any drug use by his son. 'It was a great family,' he said. 'He seemed very happy.' Kirk said police had not given him any information about how the 911 call was handled. Family: In the 911 call, Mrs Kirk, shown center with her sons who are believed to have witnessed the murder, also told dispatchers her husband 'wanted her to shoot him,' according to the statement .","Kristen Kirk, 44, shot dead in her home on Monday night just a mile from the police station .

Allegheny County Medical Examiner Dr. Karl Williams says his office has yet to determine whether Nicole Kotchey's death was a suicide, a homicide or an accident. Williams and UPMC spokeswoman Susan Manko say Pittsburgh police are still investigating the circumstances surrounding Kotchey's sudden passing at Magee Womens Hospital of UPMC November 12. Poisoned: University of Pittsburgh Medical Center researcher Nicole Kotchey, 35, died as a result of exposure to cyanide earlier this month, an autopsy showed . Sudden passing: Kotchey collapsed at work and died four hours after her colleagues found her lying unresponsive on the floor . Kotchey, of Ross Township, was a medical researcher at the Pittsburgh hospital. Kotchey's death came a week after another former UPMC medical researcher, Dr. Robert Ferrante, was convicted of first-degree murder in the April 2013 cyanide poisoning death of his wife, Dr. Autumn Klein. Dr Klein was a neurologist also employed by UPMC. There are no indications at this time that the two cases are related. Miss Kotchey collapsed at work on the morning of November 12 and was found lying on the floor in front of her desk at around 8.30am. About four fours later, Kotchey was pronounced dead. Mystery: Investigators are not sure at this time whether Kotchey's death was a homicide, a suicide or an accident . Eerie coincidence: Kotchey's death came a week after another former UPMC medical researcher, Dr. Robert Ferrante (left), was convicted of first-degree murder in the April 2013 cyanide poisoning death of his wife, Dr. Autumn Klein (right) 'It was a mystery death that very rapidly evolved into having some kind of concern of cyanide,' Karl Williams told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. Pittsburgh Police Lt. Daniel Herrmann told the newspaper that homicide detectives will now begin an 'in-depth investigation,' looking into the researcher's past for clues. Ms Kotchey is survived by her parents, David and Michelle, and her brother, Gregg.","Nicole Kotchey, 35, collapsed at her desk at Magee Womens Hospital of UPMC November 12 and died hours later .

"Cristiano Ronaldo has been likened to former basketball superstar Michael Jordan by overwhelmed Elche coach Fran Escriba. The Real Madrid forward took his La Liga tally to nine goals in four games this season following another four strikes in the 5-1 hammering of Elche on Tuesday.

"Dressed up in a white, plunging gown and full make-up, I have already turned a few heads in the London bar in which I’m sipping a cocktail. So when I see my husband Tom striding across the floor, I’m confident that, for once, I should have his full attention. I flash him a beaming smile — yet he walks straight past me. I suppose I can hardly blame him. For while he has spent 20 years going to bed with a curly haired brunette, tonight he will be snuggling up with a blonde bombshell. Scroll down for video . Charlotte (left) tries out Nigella's look with the platinum blonde wig (right). At first she is not convinced the style or the colour will suit her face, but changes her mind as soon as it is fixed in place . My conservative chestnut waves — perfectly appropriate for a 42-year-old mother-of-three who lives in the Home Counties — have been replaced by a poker-straight, platinum blonde bob — and my personality has undergone something of a transformation, too. I’m usually quite shy (not to mention married) but, emboldened by my new look, I find myself catching the barman’s eye and smiling at strange men across the room. And the best thing about my new image? In the morning I can go back to my conservative dark hair and avoid attracting the opprobrium of the other mums on the school run. For I am following the advice of Domestic Goddess Nigella Lawson, famed for her dark, sultry appearance, who this week revealed the secret to her party look: wigs. Short, long, curly or straight, the chef says she loves them all. ‘Other people do paper hats at Christmas. I do wigs,’ she confessed. ‘Most of the year I’m not a party person, but I love a Christmas do, and go for it full tilt.’ While the celebrity chef probably doesn’t need to watch the pennies, at around £25 per wig, changing your hair colour could be cheaper than splashing out on new frocks for the party season — and it’s guaranteed to have far more impact. Charlotte Kemp, left, pictured with her usual hairstyle, and right, Nigella with her recognisable brunette locks . ‘This is not about fancy dress,’ stresses Claire Pateman, of online hair emporium Annabelle’s Wigs, where Nigella buys her wigs. ‘She loves to go blonde for the night, whereas my alter ego is a red-haired vixen. You can transform your look in an instant without the expense or regret of an expensive haircut. You can spend the night as a feisty redhead or a blonde bombshell . . . You can be whoever you want to be.’ As someone who has never even dyed her hair, let alone experimented with dramatic cuts, I’m a little nervous at the prospect of following Nigella’s lead and donning outrageous wigs. So will these five very different wig styles pep up my wardrobe for the festive season — or just leave me with one very confused husband? Nigella's platinum bob . £25.99, annabelleswigs.co.uk . CHARLOTTE’S VERDICT: With her porcelain skin and chiselled cheekbones, Nigella carried off this striking platinum blonde bob with aplomb. But I’m not convinced the colour — let alone the Cleopatra-esque fringe — will suit my round face and double chin quite as well. I change my mind as soon as the wig is in place. To be honest, I can’t quite believe the swan-necked beauty I see in the mirror is really me. I’m transfixed by how green my eyes look (they are hazel but my colouring always brings out the brown) and the cut is so modern and funky. It couldn’t be more of a dramatic change from my boring hair, which just hangs there like glossy spaniel’s ears. I’m a middle-aged Lady Gaga and I love it. Tom thinks I look ‘quite cute’, too — once he recognises me, that is. The Towie Blonde . Charlotte tries out a long blonde wig - and her daughter's assume she has dressed up as Princess Elsa from the Disney film Frozen. She says the 'Towie' wig doesn't make her feel liberated, but rather repressed . £26.99, annabelleswigs.co.uk . CHARLOTTE’S VERDICT: OK, so now I’m a living Barbie doll. I’m exploring my inner TOWIE — except I don’t want to. I long to smoulder quietly in the corner as a bookish brunette rather than strut about like a low-rent glamour girl. It’s just such a cliche. I don’t feel liberated, I feel repressed. My husband and daughters don’t see any of this gender politics. Tom says: ‘I didn’t recognise you,’ in an alarmingly positive tone, before asking if we can keep it. My daughters assume I’m dressing up as Elsa, the icy heroine of the Disney film Frozen. ‘You could go to parties and sing Let It Go,’ they cry. It’s the wig I want to let go. It’s not me. Not even for a night. The Claudia Winkleman . The fringed wig did not go down well with Charlotte's family who said she looked like  Morticia Addams . £26.99, annabelleswigs.co.uk . CHARLOTTE’S VERDICT: I have an adventurous friend who is constantly experimenting with fringes, but I’m too chicken. Also, I can’t shake off a sneaky suspicion it’s a little too mutton-dressed-as-lamb for a woman over 40 (sorry Claudia Winkleman and Carol Vorderman). My friends are complimentary, saying it frames my face and ‘looks much more modern than your usual haircut’. Gee, thanks! I’d wear it to trendy parties — but it wasn’t a winner with my family. Tom, who does a double-take when he comes in to find me washing up wearing my new do, says I look like Morticia from the Addams Family. To be fair, it does accentuate the bags under my eyes. The final word goes to the children, who say I look like a witch. The family hamster . This wig made her feel like a 'prim secretary' and Charlotte says she would be traumatised if she had her hair cut and coloured in this style . £26.99, annabelleswigs.co.uk . CHARLOTTE’S VERDICT: I look awful in this wig. The colour does nothing for me, the cut makes my head look smaller, my face rounder and my eyebrows look like two black slugs. I feel like I’ve aged ten years, and wearing it even changes my personality — I find myself behaving like a prim secretary. Tom is even more brutal — he says I look like the family hamster. I certainly don’t feel as feminine now I don’t have any long tresses to swish hither and thither. No wonder, then, that my friends and husband are unanimous in their verdict to ‘take it off’. Thankfully, I can. I would be traumatised if I’d had my hair cut and coloured like this. The sexy school ma’am . Her husband said this style made her look younger and slimmer because her neck and shoulders are visible . £76, hothair.co.uk . CHARLOTTE’S VERDICT: I thought Tom would hate this look. He has always been possessive about my long hair, telling me it’s one of my best features. But he’s the first to admit he likes this cut, albeit in a ‘sexy schoolteacher’ kind of way. He says it makes me look younger (yay) and slimmer (double yay) because my neck and shoulders are on show. My friends rave about the cut, telling me it frames my face and makes my eyes look enormous — always a good thing. But I feel I look too much like my dad to feel terribly sassy (sorry Pa!). I guess if I wore this wig enough times, the length might grow on me!","Nigella Lawson this week revealed the secret to her party look - wigs .

"The Taliban are not an enemy of the U.S. and should not be talked about in such terms, Joe Biden has claimed. The vice-president said the militant Islamist group only represents an inherent threat if it allows Al-Qaeda to strike at the U.S. In an interview with Newsweek, Mr Biden warned against labelling the Taliban as an enemy. Language of peace? Joe Biden said the Taliban only represents an inherent threat if it allows Al-Qaeda to strike at the U.S. He said: 'That's critical. There is not a single . statement that the president has ever made in any of our policy . assertions that the Taliban is our enemy because it threatens U.S. interests.' Mr Biden's comments come as senior U.S. officials prepare to negotiate a peace deal with Taliban militants. Even after a surge in U.S. troops in . Afghanistan has pushed the Taliban out of much of their southern . stronghold, the group's intentions regarding peace talks remain . unclear. A senior Taliban commander, speaking . after U.S. officials' description of the peace process was published on . Sunday, denied the group is engaged in negotiations. 'Our position on talks remains the . same. All occupying forces have to leave Afghanistan. Then we can talk,' the commander told Reuters. It is thought that the Taliban might deny taking part in initial discussions to shore up morale among fighters on the ground. But the news of possible peace talks with the Taliban has been met with some resistance, illustrating the political risk the Obama administration is taking by considering a prisoner transfer. Down with arms? U.S. officials are preparing to negotiate a peace deal with Taliban militants . Government officials claim a transfer of Taliban prisoners from the Guantanamo Bay military prison into Afghan government custody could be one confidence-building measure critical to making progress towards a peace deal between the Taliban and the government of Afghan President Hamid Karzai. But a key Republican senator yesterday warned against negotiations with the Taliban. Senator Saxby Chambliss, senior . Republican on the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, said: 'It sounds as if the administration has decided to negotiate with terrorists, something the United States does not do. 'Handing over detainees, who likely continue to pose a threat to the United States, should not be the first step in building confidence.' Officials are not optimistic about their chances of clinching a deal, but they hope the transfer of five Taliban detainees and other possible confidence-building measures, including a Taliban denunciation of terrorism, might lead to authentic Afghan-Taliban talks on the war-torn country's political future. Republican Senator Saxby Chambliss . White House efforts to strike a deal . with a repressive Islamist movement that has been killing U.S. soldiers . for a decade - even if it is now widely accepted the war cannot be won . on the battlefield alone - could become a liability for Mr Obama in an . election year. Mr Chambliss said: 'Any discussion of prisoner transfers should only be done after an agreement to cease hostilities has been reached. 'It should be done in the open, with thorough oversight from Congress and visibility for the American people about exactly who these detainees are and what terrorist acts they committed.' Officials said the possible transfer of detainees would be a 'national decision' made in consultation with Congress in accordance with new rules for handling detainees. Mr Obama is expected to shortly sign into law the 2011 defence authorisation bill, which includes provisions that would broaden the military's involvement in detaining suspected militants and require the Pentagon to certify in most cases certain security conditions will be met before prisoners can be sent home. But the White House has stressed that any real negotiations must take place directly between the Karzai government and the Taliban, with U.S. diplomats only playing a facilitating role. Yet it is clear that in Washington, there is a growing willingness to engage directly with the Taliban as foreign troops edge closer towards the exit in Afghanistan. Mr Obama has promised to withdraw his 33,000 surge troops by next autumn, and most foreign combat troops are expected to be gone by the end of 2014, leaving Afghan forces in the lead. A modest U.S. troop presence is expected to stay beyond that, focused on counter-terrorism and training local forces.","Vice-president said the Islamist group only represents a threat if it allows Al-Qaeda .

"Philae broke hearts earlier this month when, in its dying moments, it managed to send back valuable data from comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. But, all is not lost. Rosetta engineers claim the plucky probe could come back to life as soon as March next year, as comet 67P gets closer to the sun. The probe is currently only receiving around an hour of sunlight during the comet's 12-hour day, with its batteries frozen in  temperatures of -170°C. Back from the dead: Philae (pictured) broke hearts earlier this month when, in its dying moments, it managed to send back valuable data from comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko. Now, Rosetta engineers claim it could come back to life in March 2015 as comet 67P gets closer to the sun . Previous estimates simply said the probe could awaken within 'the next few months', but now a more precise timeframe has been revealed. In a recent Reddit 'ask me anything' session, engineers at mission control said: 'We expect to have enough energy to boot around March next year. 'Then Philae needs to be heated until we can think of starting to charge the battery. The batteries were meant to be recharged by solar panels, but because Philae hopped a couple of times after the first touchdown, it ended up in shadow. 'It is like trying to power your house with solar panels when you live in Alaska just below the Arctic Circle during the winter,' said Michael Maibaum, Philae systems engineer. 'Welcome to a comet!': Earlier this month, Esa tweeted this remarkable picture from comet 67P confirming that Philae is successfully on the surface. It bounced twice before landing in almost complete darkness . Engineers claim the seasonal change toward spring in Philae's hemisphere will bring the probe into much more sunlight over the next few months. That, coupled with the fact that the comet is getting closer to the sun, should warm up the batteries enough to keep them charged. Stephan Ulamec, manager of the Philae lander, added that he was 'very optimistic' that it would soon wake up. The amount of science that the team will be able to do will depends on how long it takes to recharge the batteries, he said. The historic touchdown of Philae on a comet could be big step toward 'moving off this planet' and 'taking' the entire solar system . The historic touchdown of Philae on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko could be big step toward 'moving off this planet' and 'taking' the entire solar system. This is according to Nasa's planetary science head, Jim Green, who said the solar system is now in reach of wider human exploration. The space agency is hoping to send humans to Mars in the 2030s, and data from Rosetta's mission could help make that a reality by revealing more planets in our solar system. 'How audacious! How exciting!' Green said, after the landing was made. 'The solar system is mankind's - this mission is the first step to take it. 'It's ours… It's these steps that will lead us beyond this planet and on to Mars and out into the solar system.' 'I truly believe that a single planet species will not survive long. It's our destiny to move off this planet.' Nasa described yesterday's landing as 'a great day for space exploration.' 'We congratulate Esa on their successful landing on a comet today,' said John Grunsfeld. 'This achievement represents a breakthrough moment in the exploration of our solar system and a milestone for international cooperation.' Scientists hope that samples drilled out from the comet will unlock details about how the planets - and possibly even life - evolved. Comets date back to the formation of the solar system some 4.5 billion years ago. Scientists suspect impacting comets delivered water to early Earth. During the AMA, the team also said that one of the biggest limitations of the mission was using decades old technology. 'The biggest drawback for Philae was the limited computer power and mass memory,' said Ekkehard Kührt, science manager for Rosetta. 'What we could install there - 800 MHz CPU and some memory - seems to be from another world today'. The Rosetta probe, which was carrying Philae, launched into space in 2004, using the gravity of Earth and Mars to slingshot its way towards comet 67P. It chased comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko through space for more than ten years. This image, annotated by Emily Lakdawalla from The Planetary Society, shows the precarious position the lander is currently in. At the top the view into space can be seen. One of the feet is obscured from view. The bottom left image is the direction that the Mupus instrument was deployed to take readings from the surface . Despite this, after a four billion mile (6.5 billion km) journey, the probe successfully released Philae from its grip to land on the comet, travelling at 1 metre (40 inches) per second relative to the comet. But when it first made contact with the surface it failed to fire harpoons that would have kept it attached to the comet. This resulted in it bouncing to a height of 0.62 miles (1km) above the comet before again landing on the surface. It then bounced again, but to a much lower altitude. Scientists recently said they had detected what might be complex carbon compounds on the surface of the comet the craft landed on two weeks ago. The team in Darmstadt, Germany, are pictured here celebrating as news of Philae's separation from Rosetta. Scientists hope the £1 billion ($1.6 billion) project will solve some of the greatest puzzles in science - including the origins of life on Earth . The team leader for the Ptolemy instrument, Professor Ian Wright, told BBC News: 'We can say with absolute certainty that we saw a very large signal of what are basically organic (carbon) compounds. 'There is a rich signal there. It is not simple. It is not like there are two compounds; there are clearly a lot of things there - a lot of peaks. Sometimes a complicated compound can give a lot of peaks.' Scientists hope the £1 billion ($1.6 billion) project will solve some of the greatest puzzles in science - including the origins of life on Earth. Open University Professor Ian Wright, who helped create Ptolemy, said: ‘The idea that comets may have brought the building blocks of life to Earth is one of the reasons why we want to study them.’ Professor Stanley Cowley, planetary scientist at the University of Leicester, added: ‘It is an interesting relic from that otherwise inaccessible epoch.’","Claim was made during a Reddit Q&A with the Rosetta mission team .

"Hormone replacement therapy raises women's risk of getting brain a tumour by 30 per cent, according to researchers. Women who take medication to relieve the symptoms of the menopause could therefore be putting themselves in danger of cancer and other illnesses. For those who use HRT over a period of time, the risk of developing a tumour is as high as 70 per cent. Danger: Hormone replacement therapy could raise the danger of breast cancer by 30 per cent . Scientists from the Danish Cancer Research Centre found a link between post-menopausal hormone treatment and meningioma, the most common type of brain tumour, according to The Sun. 'Long-term HRT use, particularly of combined oestrogen-progestogen, may increase the risk of meningioma,' researchers from the centre said. HRT raises the risk of the tumour by 30 per cent, while women who use the medication for a decade or more have a two-thirds risk of developing meningioma. While 85 per cent of tumours are benign and do not develop into a cancer, meningioma can cause other damaging symptoms. Tumour sufferers are prone to headaches, hearing loss and even seizures. Cancer risk: Most tumours are benign but some can be deadly if they turn out to be malignant . The new research could explain why women are more likely to get brain tumours than men. It also appears that meningiomas have become more common over the past few years, which could be due to the increasing popularity of HRT. Hormones such as oestrogen are prescribed to middle-aged women to alleviate symptoms of the menopause such as hot flushes and joint pain. However, HRT has previously been linked to an increased risk of serious conditions such as cancer, heart attacks and strokes. Cancer Research UK recommends that women use HRT for as short a time as possible to minimise the possibility of adverse side effects.","Hormone replacement could cause meningioma in menopausal women .

"A Pennsylvania mother-of-two is facing jail time after disclosing to police during a routine traffic stop last year in New Jersey that she had a loaded handgun in the vehicle. Shaneen Allen, 27, of Philadelphia, bought the gun legally and has a concealed carry permit in her home state, but New Jersey does not recognize the gun license. Allen went from getting only a traffic ticket to being arrested and charged with illegal gun possession and armor-penetrating bullets, records showed. Fully licensed: Shaneen Allen, 27, has a license to carry a gun in Pennsylvania . The handgun: Allen's .380 Bersa Thunder, similar to the one pictured, is what landed her in hot water . ‘She voluntarily and honestly told the officer that she had her licensed handgun and gave him her license to carry,’ Allen's attorney Evan Nappen told WCAU. ‘She’s a hard-working single mom. It’s really crazy that New Jersey is taking someone who’s got no criminal record and was doing nothing wrong — other than a minor traffic violation — and making it into a felony-level conviction with minimal mandatory time.’ Nappen claims his client was unaware that new Jersey did not reciprocally recognize Pennsylvania gun permits even though 30 other states do. Allen did not know her .380 Bersa Thunder handgun loaded with hollow-point bullets was illegal in the Garden State, and faces a mandatory three-year prison sentence if found guilty. There would be no chance of parole. ‘We’re talking about a law-abiding, licensed person who did nothing wrong,’ Nappen told WWOR. 'She is now facing three-years minimum mandatory, where the judge has no discretion, in state’s prison.’ Mother-of-two: The single mom bought the handgun to protect her family after multiple break-ins of her home, according to her attorney . Innocent: Allen's attorney claims New Jersey should recognize her Pennsylvania gun license . Allen bought the gun as protection for her family only a week earlier after her home was broken into twice, according to Nappen. The Atlantic County Prosecutor has denied a request to allow Allen into a diversionary program that would allow her to avoid jail time, Nappen told WWOR. She is the mother to two young daughters and has no prior criminal record outside a handful of minor traffic violations, records showed. Nappen claims to have handled about a dozen similar cases in the past year, and is now working on getting a federal law passed to address the issue. Prison time: If convicted, Allen faces a minimum of three years behind bars . ‘People believe that your gun license should be treated like your driver’s license. Right now there’s a national law being proposed that would mandate that all states recognize other states licenses,’ he told WCAU. ‘It’s still pending, but it's needed for people like this. ‘I’m calling that bill Shaneen’s law.’ Gun laws are decided at the state – not federal – level, and New Jersey’s are among the nation’s strictest. ‘Each state has legal authority to regulate behavior within its borders,’ University of Pennsylvania Law School professor Kermit Roosevelt told WCAU. ‘So, they're saying we have laws, and if you come here, you have to play by our rules,’ he explained, adding that police had every right to arrest Allen. Roosevelt did agree, though, that a federal law would be a more reasonable solution. Nappen said he will ask for a dismissal of all charges at Allen’s next court date on August 5. Allen did not respond to multiple MailOnline messages left seeking further comment.","Shaneen Allen legally bought the handgun in Pennsylvania where she lives .

"MIT researchers have created a camera which can take images so fast - one trillion of them in just a second - that it can capture light as it travels across objects. Nothing can go faster than the speed of light, which thanks to the work of scientific legends such as Leon Foucault and Einstein, we know to be 299,792,458 metres per second in a vacuum. But developers at MIT have managed to catch up, with their camera taking so many images that, when you play them in sequence at super-low-speed, you can see a light beam as it travels from A to B. The fascinating video below was demonstrated at a TED technology conference in Edinburgh. It shows a burst of light traveling the length of a one-litre Coke bottle, bouncing off the cap, before then reflecting back to the bottle’s bottom. Scroll down for video: . What is this? It is the first micro-micro-micro second of light photons travelling into a Coca Cola bottle . The small beam of light - just a millimetre in length - travels further up the bottle, seen thanks to the trillion-exposure camera . While it is not an advert for Coca Cola, there is something very majestic as the famous slogan comes into focus thanks to the tiny light beam . The light scatters now it is inside the bottle, and illuminates the plastic from within . Specific: The video even shows the specific moment that the cap gets illuminated . Brief illumination: The bottle begins to darken again as the light scatters onwards . First of all pointing out that Coca Cola did not sponsor this experiment, Media Lab Associate Professor Ramesh Raskar explained the physics behind the experiment to the TED crowd in Edinburgh. The team used a laser, flicking it on and off in the space of a femtosecond - or a millionth of a billionth of a second. TED Talk: Media Lab Associate Professor Ramesh Raskar during his presentation . In order to get a grip on how short this time is, an oft-quoted example is that a femtosecond is to a second what a second is to about 32 million years. The laser, turned on and off, sends out a small beam of light, measuring in length just a millimetre. The light is directed at a Coca Cola bottle in a darkened room, and the camera then film the light as it (relatively) slowly enters the bottle through the plastic bottom, moves to the far end while scattering light within the bottle, and then bounces off the bottle cap. This is the first time light has publicly been filmed moving, and could have huge repercussions in everything from photography to medical revolutions to shopping. If the technology can become cheap to produce commercially, people could carry scanners to the supermarket and check the ripeness of their fruit and vegetable, as the scanner can beam light into, say, a tomato. If a tomato is ripe, light will be absorbed into the fruit and bounce around, causing a 'glow' in a super-slow video. Unripe or old fruit would not absorb the light. Media Lab postdoc Andreas Velten, one of the system’s developers, called the camera it the 'ultimate' in slow motion. He said: 'There’s nothing in the universe that looks fast to this camera,'. See the TED video here: . The system relies on a recent technology called a streak camera, deployed in a totally unexpected way. The aperture of the streak camera is a narrow slit. Particles of . light - photons - enter the camera through the slit and are converted . into electrons, which pass through an electric field that deflects them . in a direction perpendicular to the slit. Because the electric field is changing very rapidly, it deflects the . electrons corresponding to late-arriving photons more than it does those . corresponding to early arriving ones. The image produced by the camera is thus two-dimensional, but only . one of the dimensions — the one corresponding to the direction of the . slit — is spatial. The other dimension, corresponding to the degree of . deflection, is time. The image thus represents the time of arrival of . photons passing through a one-dimensional slice of space. The camera was intended for use in experiments where light passes . through or is emitted by a chemical sample. Since chemists are chiefly . interested in the wavelengths of light that a sample absorbs, or in how . the intensity of the emitted light changes over time, the fact that the . camera registers only one spatial dimension is irrelevant. But it’s a serious drawback in a video camera. How it works: A tiny laser pulse is fired towards an object, such as a coke bottle or a brick wall . Explanation: The tiny beam of light (pictured center) travels towards the wall . When the light hits an object, in this case a wall, it scatters in a thousand directions . To produce their super-slow-mo videos, Velten, Media Lab Associate . Professor Ramesh Raskar and Moungi Bawendi, the Lester Wolfe Professor . of Chemistry, must perform the same experiment - such as passing a light . pulse through a bottle - over and over, continually repositioning the . streak camera to gradually build up a two-dimensional image. Synchronising the camera and the laser that generates the pulse, so . that the timing of every exposure is the same, requires a battery of . sophisticated optical equipment and exquisite mechanical control. It takes only a nanosecond - a billionth of a second - for light to . scatter through a bottle, but it takes about an hour to collect all the . data necessary for the final video. For that reason, Raskar calls the new system 'the world’s slowest fastest camera.' After an hour, the researchers accumulate hundreds of thousands of . data sets, each of which plots the one-dimensional positions of photons . against their times of arrival. Raskar, Velten and other members of . Raskar’s Camera Culture group at the Media Lab developed algorithms that . can stitch that raw data into a set of sequential two-dimensional . images.","Even 'travelling at the speed of light' cannot defeat the 'world's fastest camera'

Dan LeBatard was suspended for two days after a billboard with a picture of two championship rings was thrown up this week in the departed Heat star’s hometown of Akron. Several more are planned for the Cleveland area. ‘You’re welcome, LeBron. Love, Miami. Paid for by ’ the billboard reads. It includes pictures of his two championship rings won while with the team, and says it was paid for by LeBatard. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . 'You're welcome': These billboards erected across Akron and Cleveland mocked LeBron James leaving Miami, and landed radio host Dan LeBatard a two-day suspension . Fan acrimony has been high in Miami since King James bolted town to return to the Cleveland Cavaliers. ESPN called the billboard a stunt in a statement announcing LeBatard’s two-day suspension, but he disagreed. Dan will be off the air for two days, returning Monday,’ the network said. ‘His recent stunt does not reflect ESPN’s standards and brand. Additionally, we were not made aware of his plans in advance.’ LeBatard disagreed, saying ‘I guess ESPN didn’t find it all quite as funny as I did,’ in a text to Miami Herald reporter Greg Cote, a contributor to the radio show. ‘The Dan LeBatard Show’ is based out of Miami but syndicated nationally on several ESPN Radio affiliates. Two-time champion: LeBron James )pictured in 2012 against the New York Knicks) won back-to-back NBA titles in Miami before returning home to Cleveland . Also a reporter for the Herald, LeBatard told the paper he initially tried to buy full page ads in Ohio newspapers – they rejected the idea. The billboards were ‘meant in fun — which, of course, will turn into Cleveland people getting filled with rage, poison and irrational hostility and want to use those billboards as a guillotine,’ said the radio host. ‘Sports are so great, the more irrational the better. This is a publicity stunt disguised as a movement… It’s just fun anarchy.’ LeBatard is no stranger to controversy. He earned a lifetime ban from the Baseball Writers Association of America earlier this year after selling his Hall of Fame vote to Deadspin and its readers. James announced last month in a Sports Illustrated essay that he was returning to the Cavaliers.","The billboards were erected in Akron, where James lives, and Cleveland .

"Italian superyacht designer Federico Fiorentino has revealed a new concept that could one day be a floating playground for a billionaire and his or her celebrity friends. The luxury vessel, called The Belafonte, is a superyacht on steroids with a massive bow and striking bronze exterior that catches the sun’s reflection off the sea. At 164ft in length, the aluminium yacht takes full advantage of its outdoor space, boasting three decks with plenty of room for lounging or partying. Designed by Federico Fiorentino, The Belafonte boasts three decks with plenty of room for lounging or partying . Comfort: The Belafonte has room for up to ten overnight guests who will retire to five luxurious cabins . With room for up to ten overnight guests, the mini-cruise ship has five luxurious cabins, including a large VIP suite, two twin cabins and a double cabin. The owner will retire to the largest room of all. At nearly 900 square feet, it has a separate studio, balcony, walk-in closets and two bathrooms. Guests will be pampered by the ship’s crew as they relax in a saloon, outdoor dining area, pool or a shaded sky lounge. Stunning: The superyacht's top deck has a hot tub, shaded bar and a private area for sunlounging . Renderings of the impressive superyacht show a hot tub surrounded by sunloungers on the top deck, while the spacious middle deck boasts a small pool just steps from a large, circular table for alfresco dining. The front of the upper deck features a private lounge for sunbathing.

"Teens learning to drive are used to their parents watching their every step. However, one California couple has raised the bar with a hi-tech monitor than can analyse every detail of their 16 year old son's drives - and automatically tell both him and them where he's going wrong. Californians Jaideep and Sandhya Jain decided to take matters into their own hands after realising their son was about to start learning - and first invented the device first themselves. Scroll down for video . The Truvolo app and the small transmitted that plugs into the car . The Truvolo Drive is a small device that plugs in to a car's standard diagnostic port. It comes with a free app that users install on their smart phone. The Truvolo app communicates via Bluetooth with the Drive to collect data while they drive and sends it to Truvolo’s secure platform. The platform does all the number crunching and converts the raw data into information that is actually useful to users. It took a year to put the plan together and launch the company, and throughout the process, their son Anoop was using the device, which can send data on driving patterns to an app. The firm is now accepting preorders - and luckily still has a test subject in the family. 'Our son is 16 now, and actually got his license a few weeks ago,' Mr Jain told MailOnline. 'He is using it - and actually says he's learning quite a bit, and it really gives us peace of mind as well.' Truvolo works using a small transmitter that plugs into a car's On-Board Diagnostic port. Using a built-in accelerometer, Truvolo takes monitors G-forces that translate to abrupt acceleration, deceleration and swerving, all of which are reported via the app at the end of each trip. Using the driver's phones GPS, Truvolo also will automatically alert others when you've arrived at your destination. 'Know if your family, and especially teens, are driving safely,' the firm boasts. Mr Jain said the firm will produce two versions - one for families, and one for corporate fleet managers. 'We are focused on the family fleet - it can work across multiple cars, and the app can show all our children. The app can give each drive a score - and tell parents how their child is doing . 'For instance, in our family we have three cars and three drivers - and I can see data from all of them in the app. The project is now for preorders, and the first products are expected to ship in July. Anoop's mother and the company's co-founder Sandhya said she came up with the idea while driving him to school. 'Over a year ago during an early morning drive to my son’s high school, he reminded me that within a year he could be driving his own car,' said Sandhya. 'This got me thinking. Would he drive safely? What if he didn’t? Would I even know? With all the technology inside today’s cars wouldn’t it be nice to know what is going on with the car when I am not riding in it?' She said after carrying out some research, the pair realised there was a niche in the market. 'I found that although there were a few products out there that deal with parts of this puzzle, there was no complete and affordable solution out there to bridge the gap between the data available in my car and my daily life.' Jaideep and Sandhya, 46, Indian emigrants who met pursuing computer science master's degrees at Kansas State University, decided to build a suitable gadget themselves. It can also show alerts such and low fuel or when the engine needs checking . Another key feature of Truvolo’s solution is the ability to track car performance. Users receive information from a vehicle’s internal system providing information on items such as the check engine light or fuel efficiency. 'Over 75% of car owners we’ve talked to use the sticker on the windshield to track their routine maintenance schedule,' the firm says. 'Truvolo is replacing that service sticker and putting the power and control back into the hands of the car owner. 'With Truvolo, users will have unprecedented insight into their vehicles which may not only save them money, but potentially their lives.'

"Buildings of the future may have mirrors  that reflect sunlight into space to keep them cool. Developers of the new technology hope the concept could lead to a cheaper and more sustainable form of air conditioning. Their incredibly thin material offloads heat from the sun into space in the form of infrared radiation, and could keep buildings 5°C (9°F) cooler than the surrounding air during the day. Scientists at Stanford University in California have created an ultra-reflective mirror. The incredibly thin material reflects infrared light from buildings (illustration shown), and it could be placed on top of buildings to keep them cool in hot weather by reflecting infrared radiation into space . The technology was developed by scientists at Stanford University in California. It consists of a multi-layered material that is just 1.8 millionths of a metre thick, thinner than the thinnest aluminium foil. This material is made of seven layers of silicon dioxide and hafnium oxide on top of a layer of silver. Heat can be transferred in three ways: conduction, convection and radiation. This material deals with the latter, reflecting infrared light directly into space. The ultrathin coating was carefully constructed to send this infrared light away from buildings at the precise frequency that allows it to pass through the atmosphere without warming the air, a key feature given the dangers of global warming. Professor Shanhui Fan of Stanford University said it was 'like having a window into space'. The coating prevents 97 per cent of sunlight from striking the building and heating it up. This can make the building 5°C (9°F) cooler than the surrounding air during the day. The internal structure of the material radiates incoming infrared rays back into space. Invisible light in the form of infrared radiation is one of the ways that all objects and living things throw off heat. For example, when standing in front of an oven without touching it, the heat felt is infrared light. Sunshine, in a similar way, radiates heat to Earth and can significantly warm buildings in the hottest parts of the world unless they have air conditioning. This cheaper method would prevent electricity needing to be used for air conditioning, and would instead just constantly keep buildings cool. About 15 per cent of energy used in buildings in the US is apparently spent powering air conditioning systems. The material would need to be installed on the roof of a building, where it would reflect heat straight back up into space. The new material reflects 97% of sunlight, making the building 5°C (9°F) cooler than the surrounding air. They say it is a cheaper solution to air conditioning (stock image shown) as the planet warms . As it is highly reflective, placing it on the side of buildings would probably not be an option, as it would radiate heat onto the ground and potentially heat up populated areas such as cities. But its potential for use on the top of buildings is obvious, and the team also think it could be used as a spray-on material to make objects more able to withstand the elements. The researchers said that as the planet gets warmer, such cooling technologies that don't require power might become more commonplace. 'Across the developing world, photonic radiative cooling makes off-grid cooling a possibility in rural regions, in addition to meeting skyrocketing demand for air conditioning in urban areas,' said lead author Dr Aaswath Raman. Right now the Stanford team's prototype is the size of a personal pizza, but cooling buildings will require larger panels. The researchers say there exist large-area fabrication facilities that can make their panels at the scales needed, which will be needed before the prototype can be developed further. More broadly, the team sees this project as a first step toward using the cold of space as a resource. In the same way that sunlight provides a renewable source of solar energy, the cold universe supplies a nearly unlimited expanse to dump heat. 'Every object that produces heat has to dump that heat into a heat sink,' Professor Fan said. 'What we've done is to create a way that should allow us to use the coldness of the universe as a heat sink during the day.'","Scientists at Stanford University in California create ultra-reflective mirror .

"Leaning over her nine-year-old daughter to check on her homework, Kate Lurie felt an agonising pain rip through her right shoulder and reverberate across her back. ‘I’d never felt anything like it before — it was awful, like hot pins burning into my skin,’ she says. ‘I crumpled on to a chair, trying to stop myself howling in pain.’ Thinking she’d just pulled a muscle, 40-year-old Kate spent the next couple of days on round-the-clock painkillers. But the throbbing in her back and shoulders was so intense, it made doing simple tasks such as driving almost impossible. The throbbing pain in Kate's back and  made doing simple tasks such as driving almost impossible (picture posed by model) She made an appointment with a physiotherapist three days later and was stunned to hear that the pain was not caused by an injury but by 20 years of sitting at a desk. Kate, a copywriter from Manchester, is one of a growing number of British women suffering from the barely recognised phenomenon ‘sitting-down disease’. As several recent studies have discovered, sitting for too long can be as dangerous to health as smoking. It more than doubles your risk of diabetes and is linked with an increase in heart disease. In fact, inactivity is the fourth biggest killer of adults, according to the World Health Organisation. But the scariest thing of all? The results are the same however much exercise people do when they’re not sitting down. ‘Most people think that if they work out every day that’s all they need to do,’ says researcher Dr Emma Wilmot, whose team at the University of Leicester analysed 18 studies incorporating a total of 800,000 people. ‘But those with jobs that require sitting all day may still be at risk. ‘When we sit for long periods of time, enzyme changes occur in our muscles that can lead to increased blood sugar levels. The effects happen very quickly, and regular exercise won’t fully protect you.’ There are a growing number of British women suffering from the barely recognised phenomenon 'sitting-down disease' (picture posed by model) The average British adult spends between 50 and 70   per cent of their day sitting down, whether it’s behind the wheel of a car or in front of a desk, computer or TV. Dr Wilmot’s team found that people who sit the longest are twice as likely to have diabetes or heart disease as those who sit the least. The team also reported that sitting for long periods appears to raise the risk of kidney disease, especially in women. And that muscle, joint and back pain, like that experienced by Kate Lurie, is becoming increasingly common among middle-class high-achievers, who spend most of their lives sitting down. Mother-of-three Kate used to spend ten hours a day sitting down to work as a science-journal copywriter. She now wishes she’d been warned of the damage her desk job could do to her health. She said: ‘It’s been awful hitting 40 and suddenly feeling like an old woman. I thought I was quite fit and active, yet, suddenly, doing something as simple as lifting up one of my children, or driving, has become catastrophically painful. ‘I think of myself as a young woman with a young family but I’ve been hobbling around like I’m in my dotage. All because I’ve spent years in a desk job.’ ‘It’s been awful hitting 40 and suddenly . feeling like an old woman. I thought I was quite fit and active, yet, . suddenly lifting up one of my children has become catastrophically painful' Kate Lurie . The back pain that told her something was seriously wrong hit in January. She’d never experienced any problems before but her physiotherapist was far from surprised. Kate recalls: ‘She told me that years of hunching over a keyboard had caused the muscles in my back to shorten, and the tissues to become like rope. ‘I used to spend hours at my desk every day, and I wouldn’t take a lunch break, I’d just eat a sandwich I’d brought from home. I’d be exhausted after a day at work, and flake out on the sofa. I could  probably count the minutes I was vertical each day on one hand. ‘Before I got the back pain, I’d already eased up on my hours and gone part-time. But that clearly didn’t make any difference — the damage had already been done.’ Nearly one in four workers blame their aches and pains on working in the same position for long periods of time. They take a total of ten million sick days a year, costing the British economy £5.7 billion. Tim Allardyce, a Surrey-based osteopath and chartered physiotherapist, says: ‘The body needs mobility. Our spines are comprised of 26 mobile blocks of bone (vertebrae) which rotate, bend, extend, and are designed for movement. Knees, hips, ankles and feet are all mobile joints, too. ‘Sit in a chair for hours a day, five days a week and the spine does not move, the knees and hips are held in a flexed position, your body will get stiff, the muscles get weak and your body gets sore. ‘Hunching over a computer increases compression through the discs in the spine and  causes stiffness and pain. It can even lead to a disc prolapse — known as a slipped disc.’  Leicester-based chiropractor Tim Hutchful says that symptoms often creep up without any warning. ‘I use what I call the paperclip analogy,’ he explains. ‘You could bend a paperclip once a day for a month and it will still function as a paperclip. Then one day it will just break. I treat women all the time who think they have a new injury but  it is in fact the result of years of desk work. Their injury is caused by what’s known as postural fixity — being stuck in one place.’ Hunching over a computer increases compression through the discs in the spine and causes stiffness and pain (picture posed by model) Women who wear stilettos and pencil skirts to work are particularly vulnerable, he adds. High heels tip the pelvis forward when we walk or stand, weakening the back’s muscles, while slim-fitting skirts restrict our joints’ range of movement when we sit down. And all the experts seem to agree there’s no way of knowing when ‘sitting-down disease’ will get you. In the case of Helen Bee, a  39-year-old graphic designer from Cheshire, it started five years ago in her right knee. ‘It began to feel stiff as I worked — I’m a computer-based designer, with a number of clients for whom . I produce leaflets and booklets. When meeting a deadline, I stayed at my desk for up to ten hours a day.’ The pain gradually worsened and 18 months ago it seriously affected Helen’s mobility. ‘I could barely get myself up the stairs, let alone go for walks with my husband, Rob. I felt awful,’ she says. Experts agree there's no way of knowing when 'sitting-down disease' will get you (picture posed by model) ‘In my mind I was a young, active woman, but I was hobbling like a frail old lady. I had this deep throbbing in my knee all the time. Yet I hadn’t banged or injured it.’ A hospital scan revealed acute inflammation around the knee joint. ‘My doctor said it was due to spending so long at my desk, and possibly because of the way I sat — leaning on one side, which was why only one knee was affected. I must have always sat like that, without realising.’ Helen has now had eight months of physiotherapy involving stretching exercises for her knee. She has also been told to lose a stone — she weighs 13st and is 5ft 7ins — as excess weight puts more pressure on her knee. So can you protect yourself from sitting-down disease without quitting your job? One simple way is not to sit for longer than 30 minutes without getting up. ‘Get a glass of water or go to speak to a colleague rather than email them,’ advises Mr Allardyce. Not slouching is vital, too. ‘Sit up with your back straight, your shoulders down and back, and elbows relaxed at your sides,’ says Ian Harding, a consultant orthopaedic surgeon. ‘Your buttocks should touch the back of the chair. And avoid crossing your legs.’ Your keyboard should be directly in front of you, with the mouse by its side, and your phone close to you to avoid repetitive reaching. ‘You should be able to keep your wrist straight, shoulders relaxed and elbows by your side while using it,’ says Mr Harding. Physiotherapy sessions to massage and manipulate the spine help combat back pain (picture posed by models) If you already have back, shoulder or knee pain, it’s important to be as active as possible as this will help your joints recover mobility. Clare Swatman, a 39-year-old mother of three from Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, has been seeing an osteopath for her bad back. ‘I spent years working for a magazine, and it was such a busy job I’d spend hours at my desk, battling with a stiff back. I used to crawl out of the office in agony.’ She also does hour-long bootcamp sessions twice a week. ‘I was in a lot of pain and felt very stiff but my osteopath said it would be all right and the camp leader knows my history. Since doing core strengthening exercises, my back feels much better.’ Meanwhile, Kate Lurie has found that after eight physiotherapy sessions to massage and manipulate her spine, and a regular exercise programme at home to stretch her shoulders and neck, she also feels much better. ‘I can’t rewrite the past but I don’t want to go through that pain again,’ she says. ‘Every time I slouch at my desk I remind myself of the agony and I straighten myself up immediately.’","Sitting for too long more than doubles your risk of diabetes .

'From March 7 – April 7, I documented everything blatantly sexist anyone has said to me,' she wrote. 'None of these comments were provoked, none of them were replies to something I said, none of them were at all out of the ordinary...

"The Church of England was at the centre of an extraordinary row last night over claims it is being used to stop Britain leaving the European Union. Prayers for Britain to stay in the EU forming part of a Brussels-backed event to mark the 40th anniversary of the UK joining the Common Market are to be said in a service at Salisbury Cathedral. The event next month is being held in Salisbury because it was the home of the late Sir Edward Heath, the Prime Minister who took the UK into what is now the EU in 1973. Leading pro-Europeans will attend. Pray for Brussels: The 'pro-EU' service will be held at Salisbury Cathedral, Wiltshire, next month to commemorate the anniversary of the UK joining the union . The programme, obtained by The Mail on Sunday, advertises as part of the event: ‘Evensong in the cathedral, during which prayers will be said for the European Union and the UK’s place therein.’ Last night, leading Eurosceptic MP Peter Bone claimed the  C of E was being ‘hijacked’ in an outrageous attempt to influence the EU debate. He said: ‘It is disgraceful the Europhile lobby should be trying to embroil the Church in this debate. 'I can’t remember the passage in the Bible where God or Jesus comes out in support of the EU. It cannot be right to pray for a European superstate mismanaging the lives of millions.’ Former diplomat Lord Hannay, who is hosting the event, denied there was anything ‘odd’ about such prayers. He insisted the evensong was not a special service for the EU commemoration and added: ‘I don’t think it will be “smite the Eurosceptics.” ’ The programme from Salisbury Cathedral, pictured, announces that 'prayers will be said for the European Union and the UK¿s place therein' But he insisted that the C of E was ‘supportive of Britain’s membership’, adding: ‘Whether or not we should be EU members is not for the Church but, once we’re members, they seem to take the view it’s a good thing.’ But embarrassingly for the organisers, Salisbury Tory MP John Glen has refused to attend. ‘I do not see the bloated bureaucracy of Europe as something to celebrate,’ he said. A C of E spokesman said he could not comment on details of the service but insisted it was up  to the preacher to decide what he or she said. A Salisbury Cathedral spokesman confirmed a group from the EU commemoration event were due  to attend a service of evensong.",Service to be held at Salisbury Cathedral next month .
"Allegations: Dave Lee Travis leaving Southwark Crown Court after being accused of assaulting nearly a dozen women over three decades . Dave Lee Travis was accused yesterday of sexually assaulting a teenager in front of the cameras on Top of the Pops during 30 years of abuse. The former Radio 1 DJ was branded a sexual predator who used his celebrity status to target vulnerable young women. He preyed on his victims at radio studios, corporate events, a hotel, a Christmas pantomime and in his trailer at an open air concert and university gig, it was claimed. Other evidence that will be put before the jury includes that of a carnival princess groped in 1973 after being told ‘what Dave wanted was what Dave got’ at a hospital radio launch. The 68-year-old was an ‘opportunist’ who crept up on unsuspecting women and plunged his hand into their underwear or grabbed their breasts, the court heard. Many of the ‘disgusted’ women, often in junior roles or at the fledgling stage of sought-after careers in media, were too scared to speak out. But they came forward years later after watching him ‘profess his blameless character’ on TV within hours of two victims making claims against him in the Daily Mail. In one of the most extraordinary allegations, Travis was accused of assaulting a 19-year-old as he filmed an episode of Top of the Pops in 1978. A short clip of the star introducing a novelty song by the Smurfs was shown to the jury at Southwark Crown Court. Prosecutors claim the DJ put his hand up the skirt and touched the bottom of a pretty teenager during the introduction. The girl was ‘angry and upset’ but when she returned home to watch the show with her best friend the assault had been edited out. Leaving: The former DJ at the end of the first day of evidence in his indecent assault trial . Prosecutor Miranda Moore QC said women ‘from all parts of the UK’ had come forward to complain about his behaviour. ‘These . crimes are alleged to have taken place in a work environment,’ she told . the jury. ‘They all show a propensity towards young women who are . vulnerable and he is an opportunist and he takes the opportunity when it . presents itself.’ The case involves 11 women who claim Travis – real name David Patrick Griffin – indecently assaulted them between 1976 and 2008. Trial: DJ Dave Lee Travis arrives at Southwark Crown Court for the start of his trial on 12 charges of indecent assault and one of sexual assault . The . grey-haired and bespectacled DJ, wearing a hearing aid, snorted and . shook his head as the allegations were made against him. He told police . the charges against him are ‘degrading’ and accused the women of being . fantasists who can ‘smell money’. In . one interview he told officers he had many offers from women but was a . happily married man, adding: ‘If you live in a sweet shop you don’t eat . sweets.’ The jury heard the . youngest victim, a 15-year-old farmer’s daughter, was indecently . assaulted after Travis invited her to his trailer at a Showaddywaddy . concert in June 1978. The ‘naïve’ girl ran into Travis who told her ‘I . love big boobs’ before allegedly ‘flicking’ her nipples, pulling up her . top and kissing her chest. ‘She . had no means of escape and started to scream, cry and shout and her . thoughts were that he was going to rape her,’ Mrs Moore said. ‘She was . terrified.’ The woman told no one until  34 years later when Travis  was caught in the middle of a media storm. Claims: Travis has been accused of assaulting young women while working as a DJ and acting in pantomime . More . than 12 years later the DJ was accused of assaulting an assistant as he . played the role of evil wizard Abanazar in Aladdin, in Crawley, West . Sussex. The jury heard he pinned the woman against the door of his . dressing room, forcing his hand down the front of her jogging bottoms. She . escaped by managing to slightly open the door as one of the Chuckle . Brothers comedy duo, who were also in the pantomime, passed by. The . first attack allegedly took place in 1976 or 1977 when Travis ground . his groin against an 18-year-old BBC archivist while playing a ‘smoochy’ song on air. Travis is also . accused of ‘jiggling’ the breasts of a 24-year-old BBC colleague as she . was introducing Woman’s Hour some time between 1981 and 1983. Plea: Travis denies all the charges against him, which date between 1976 and 2008 . The . victim did not report what happened as she felt ‘nothing would be done . about it’ as he was a ‘major DJ and she just wanted to keep her job’, . the jury was told. The next . alleged attack was at Nottingham Polytechnic when Travis attended a . student union event between January 1983 and March 1984. The victim, . then 19, claims he pinned her to the door of his campervan as he kissed . her, attempting to put his tongue in her mouth. In 1983 or 1984, Travis . is accused of assaulting a receptionist in his room at a hotel in Bude, . Cornwall, as he toured the country with Radio 1. He . allegedly molested a British Airways worker in the early 1990s, . pressing himself against her while dancing the lambada and putting his . hand up her skirt. Media: Potential jurors have been warned not to pay any attention to the public interest in the case . Travis is . accused of groping two women while working at Chiltern FM for three . years until 2003. One eventually snapped when he pushed his hand up her . skirt, screaming, ‘Don’t touch me – you are a pervert,’ the court heard. A . young woman from a national newspaper, sent to Travis’s Buckinghamshire . mansion in 2008 to interview him, accuses him of placing both hands on . her chest for a few seconds. Travis denies 13 counts of indecent assault and one of sexual assault. The case continues. Hearing: Travis pictured leaving the court yesterday after a pre-trial hearing in his assault case . Heyday: Travis pictured in the 1970s when he was at the height of his fame as a DJ and presenter . The comedian, 71, was quizzed about the fresh claims at a police station in Warwickshire. He was first arrested in November 2012 and then in April 2013 over further allegations.

"Spanish newspaper 'SPORT' described Barcelona as 'disappointing leaders' of La Liga after their loss to Real Madrid on Saturday evening. Goals from Cristiano Ronaldo, Pepe and Karim Benzema secured a 3-1 win for Los Blancos, and the media in Spain did not hold back in their criticism of Luis Enrique's Barcelona. SPORT went on to explain that despite a positive start, and an opening goal from Neymar, Madrid took advantage of Barcelona's mistakes to go on and win. 'A disappointing leader', read SPORT's headline on Sunday morning . MARCA and AS also laid into Barcelona, after they were outclassed by Real Madrid on Saturday afternoon . MARCA lauded Madrid as a 'wonder team' that overcame their opponents 'in every department'. They explained that Carlo Ancelotti's side, who are now just one point behind their rivals, were better at everything, and too much for Barcelona to handle. Benzema was described as 'stunning', while Isco, Luka Modric, Marcelo, Pepe, Sergio Ramos, Iker Casillas and Toni Kroos were all 'superb'. The Bernabau crowd were also said to be 'delighted', as Barcelona's unbeaten run in La Liga this season was brought to an end. 'Like this, like this, like this, Madrid wins', read the headline of AS on Sunday morning. They included the quotes of both managers, with Barcelona boss Enrique explaining: 'Madrid were at a very high level and deserved to win.' Carlo Ancelotti said, 'I have a very serious team that knows how to make sacrifices.' Mundo Deportivo described Barcelona as 'average', and explained that they were overcome in the second half . The Italian papers focused on Roma's missed opportunity to go top of the league . Mundo Deportivo led with the headline, 'An average Barca', while explaining that despite a competitive first half, Enrique's side were overcome after the break. Neymar's goal, they write, equalled the fastest goal ever in a Clasico in Madrid, while Luis Suarez produced a promising debut in the capital. Over in Italy, Roma missed out on a chance to go top of Serie A when they could only manage a 0-0 draw against Samporia.

"The world's oldest boatyard dating back nearly 4,000 years has been uncovered by archaeologists at the site of a new housing estate in Wales. The site, believed to be the first prehistoric boat building site ever to be discovered, was found when developers came upon the edge of a long-vanished Ice Age lake. Work on the housing estate in Monmouth, South Wales, was stopped for six months as a team of archaeologists unearthed the remains of the ancient boat building site used by prehistoric man. Scroll down for video . Site: Archaeologists have uncovered a boatyard dating back nearly 4,000 years at the site of a new housing estate in Wales . Important discovery: The site, which dates back to 1700 BC, is said to be of 'international importance'. Pictured is an artist's impression of the boatyard . Development: The site was found when developers came upon the edge of a long-vanished Ice Age lake . Archaeologist Stephen Clarke said the discovery of the site, which dates back to 1700 BC, was of 'international importance'. Mr Clarke, 71, said: 'I have been digging for 55 years and I have never seen anything like it. 'No one in the world has ever identified a prehistoric boat building site before. 'They have found fragments of boats but never a boat building site - this is of international importance.' Excavations at the site have revealed three 100ft-long channels which run parrallel to each other and at right angles to the ancient lake. The 'dead-straight' metre-wide channels are shaped like the bottom of wooden canoes. They are also cut through a mound of burned earth carbon-dated to the early Bronze Age. Unearthed: Excavations have revealed three 100ft-long channels shaped like the bottom of wooden canoes . Work underway: Archaeologists working on the site with the three channels of the boatyard clearly visible . Dig: Work on the housing estate was stopped for six months as a team of archaeologists unearthed the remains of the ancient boat building site . Boatyard: The three 100ft-long channels run parrallel to each other and at right angles to the ancient lake . Mr Clarke said they showed a twin-hulled boat with an outrigger being dragged into a huge Ice Age lake. The discovery was made on the newly built Parc Glyndwr housing estate on the edge of the historic market town of Monmouth, South Wales. Monmouth Archaeological Society moved onto the site soon after the edge of the post-glacial lake was uncovered by unsuspecting builders. Mr Clarke said: 'It’s a hell of a site - within 60 yards of it we had Stone Age artefacts and six Bronze Age sites. Boat: An artist's impression of the type of boat built in the yard . 'The three channels turned out to be 100ft-long and all perfectly parrallel, level and at right angles to the edge of the post-glacial lake. The channels show they built a boat made out of twin canoes with an outrigger. The oldest boats found by archaeologists are dugout canoes from around 7,000 to 10,000-years-ago. The Pesse canoe is the oldest ever to be recovered. It was made from the hollowed trunk of a Pinus sylvestris tree. It is believed to have been built between 8200 and 7600BC. Elsewhere, a 7,000-year-old reed boat was discovered in Kuwait while they are also known to have been used between 4000 and 3000BC in ancient Egypt and in the Indian Ocean. Logboats meanwhile also survived in Europe until modern times and are still made in the Tropics. Planked boats are believed to have developed from extended logboats or rafts. In Egypt, a method of using mortises and tenons to develop edge-fastening, instead of using stitching or sewing, became the method throughout the Mediterranean and lasted throughout the Greek and Roman times. Source: ferribyboats.co.uk . 'There was no sign of the wooden boat but there was evidence of wood working on the site - with sharp flakes of imported flint found alongside the channels.' He said the boat was built on what was a . huge prehistoric lake which became a home to hunter gatherers - and . slowly drained away over thousands of years. Prehistoric cave drawings in Scandanavia have been discovered depicting outrigger boats like the one built at Monmouth. And they were still being used in places like Fiji in the 19th century. A large boat of a similar date and form to the Monmouth remains was recently recovered from a peat bog at Lurgan, Ireland. Monmouth Archaeological Society have previously won the highest award in their field - the Silver Trowel for the Greatest Initiative in Archaeology. But after uncovering the prehistoric shipyard the archaeologists had to give it back to housing developers Charles Church. Mr Clarke said: 'The prehistoric site is now mostly under a flood pond and the parts that aren’t have been built on. 'We have preserved it by recording it to . the best of our ability before it was developed on. Unfortunately there . just isn’t the money to preserve and protect all these sites.' In use: The boats were still being used in places such as Fiji in the 19th century (pictured) The research surrounding the prehistoric boat building site is now being published in a book called The Lost Lake. Mr Clarke added: 'I am hoping other archaeologists will have seen similar channels on other sites and realise what was happening there. 'This is the first site that has been recognised in the world but there must be others out there.'

"A Voice For Men have created a replica of White Ribbon Australia's website where they discrediting research on domestic violence and claim 'women are, as often as men, the initiators of violence' Texas based group, A Voice For Men, have hijacked Australia's national anti-domestic violence campaign by launching an identical website and preaching an opposing ideology. Whiteribbon.org has been set up with the same layout and white ribbon icon as the authentic website - whiteribbon.org.au – but slams the original campaign which focuses on women as victims of domestic violence. Instead, the group claims that 'women are, as often as men, the initiators of violence', adding that they are often 'significantly less remorseful'. Their primary website also advocates for the abolition of the Violence Against Women Act and rape shield laws in the US. Recent articles published by A Voice For Men's website focus on discrediting research on domestic violence, with one article titled 'Why women's shelters are hotbeds of gender hatred'. One of the website's prominent writers, Paul Elam, was responsible for writing an article in October 2013 in which he wrote: 'in the name of equality and fairness, I am proclaiming October to be Bash a Violent B**** Month.' This is despite research that shows one in three women experience physical or sexual violence by someone they know and that on average, one woman each week is killed as a result of intimate partner violence. White Ribbon Australia was launched in 2003 as part of a global campaign to raise awareness and end men's violence against women by primarily involving men who encourage women's safety to be priority for other men. White Ribbon Australia is considering taking legal action against the organisation which is based in Texas. Pictured: Volunteers watch a roll call of all the women killed by domestic violence in the last year from around the world . Fayssal Sari, White Ribbon Australia's national executive for engagement and partnerships, told Daily Mail Australia that the organisation was seeking legal advice against the 'men's rights' website, which he described as 'an unfortunate nuisance'. 'We have sought legal advice and we have evidence of possible fraud and intellectual property infringements,' Mr Sari said. 'They are clearly trying to ride out our profile to help them achieve their sinister objective to undermine what we do and undermine the good work our 2000 male ambassadors do each day. 'That's the irony of it - we are a male led campaign to highlight the issue of women being overwhelmingly represented in these statistics.' The branding from the original and authentic White Ribbon Australia wesite, whiteribbon.org.au . A Voice For Men's website, also titled White Ribbon, has copied the authentic website's branding . 'We have evidence of possible fraud and intellectual property infringements,' Fayssal Sari, a spokesperson for White Ribbon Australia said of the 'men's rights' organisation . Mr Sari also addressed concerns that donors or anyone interested in the work of the White Ribbon campaign, may become mislead by the false website and accidentally donate to them. Their page currently gives website browsers the option to donate and states: 'After receiving many veiled legal threats, we will be routing all donations here to a legal war chest to defend our rights'. White Ribbon Australia learnt of the possibly fraudulent website a few weeks ago after the group 'coordinated a social media attack' on their Facebook and Twitter pages. 'It was very subtle and not a clearly obvious to many but we managed to defuse it. They were putting in their links on our Facebook that linked to theirs – it was just a very sinister approach, the way they wanted to defer traffic to their website,' Mr Sari said.","Texas based group, A Voice For Men, created a replica of White Ribbon Australia's website .

"Three and a half years after their debut in the competition, Manchester City are still to fall in love with the Champions League. The English champions have come a long way in a short time. Manager Manuel Pellegrini has already won two major trophies. Prior to him, Roberto Mancini did likewise. Europe, however, remains unconquered. To a degree, it remains unknown territory for the club. Samir Nasri and Wilfried Bony enjoy Manchester City training ahead of facing Barcelona on Tuesday night . Manchester City midfielder Samir Nasri (left) shares a joke with manager Manuel Pellegrini on Monday . The Manchester City squad jog during their warm-up in training on Monday in Manchester . Manager Manuel Pellegrini (right) will hope new striker Bony (left) is sharp if called upon on Tuesday . In the boardroom at the Etihad Stadium, they do not panic about City’s modest record outside the domestic game. Winning the Champions League remains important for the club’s owners but there is no great fuss made about a record that shows just one foray beyond the group stages. What is important, however, is to sense progress. Given the way City played during much of this season’s group section, they will perhaps be glad to be in the last 16 at all. It is clear, therefore, that something of a breakthrough performance is required against Barcelona on Tuesday night if questions are not to be raised about the City template in Europe. The whole Manchester City squad is put through their paces at their training complex on Monday . James Milner (right) looks confused as Frank Lampard (left) looks on during City training . Cristiano Ronaldo (centre) puts in a tackle on Manchester City's Yaya Toure at the Etihad in November 2012 .

City's Yaya Toure, Vincent Kompany and Fernadiniho can't hide their frustration against Barca last season . Asked about the subject, the in-form Samir Nasri nodded to the disparity between the club’s football at home and in Europe. He agreed when it was put to him that even the club’s supporters have not yet fully embraced the Champions League. ‘Yeh, I think that’s right,’ said Nasri. ‘We have had lot of success in the Premier League in the last years and the fans are really passionate about it. ‘But in the Champions League we need to create our history to have this special relationship with the fans in that competition, too. ‘A game like Barcelona can be a big step for us and the fans in the competition.’ Edin Dzeko celebrates his strike as Newcastle cruised past Newcastle 5-0 at the Etihad on Saturday . Sergio Aguero sprints away in celebration after scoring a vital goal against Bayern Munich in November . A year ago, City’s circumstances were similar. Same opposition, same stage of the competition, same sense of uncertainty. This season, the club’s football in Europe has been little better than before. A comeback at home against Bayern Munich was gutsy, as was a subsequent win in Rome, but there has been little conviction and certainly no consistency. Pellegrini must only hope a winter programme that has seen his team play slightly fewer games than last season — City are out of both domestic cup competitions — can help ahead of the home game on Tuesday against a team that lost for the first time in 12 games at the weekend. City star Samir Nasri wants the fans to connect with the Champions League ad inspire the team to glory . ‘I don’t think that last year we changed our style against Barcelona or showed them too much respect,’ reflected Pellegrini on a tie the Spanish team won 4-1 on aggregate. ‘Maybe we just couldn’t do what we tried to do.’ ‘We’d played 19 games in two months so we tried to play with our style another way. We were happy with the way we played in that game, we didn’t just defend all game. We tried to contain Barca but also tried to attack and we couldn’t do it. I think that this year we are going to try to do what we want to do.’ If that appeared a slightly contradictory message from the Chilean then it is not unusual. His attitude before games of this magnitude always seems to involve leaving as much as possible to interpretation. David Silva offers a wave to the crowd after scoring City's fourth during the emphatic 5-0 win over Newcastle . Pellegrini hopes his side can reverse the results from the last 16 4-1 aggregate loss to Barcelona last year . Pellegrini’s general theme on Monday was clear, however. He knows his team need to take a lead to the Nou Camp in mid-March and, if they cannot do that, they need to take a goal. A year ago they managed neither and the second leg in Spain was something of a non-event. ‘Before their last game, Barcelona won 11 games in a row,’ added Pellegrini. ‘In this match we’ll see the real Barcelona. I said last week that it was very important to focus our minds on the Newcastle game and not on Tuesday. ‘Maybe Barcelona didn’t do the same and thought they were just going to beat Malaga. It’s always important for me to try and go into these games and win the game but also win the previous one. Luis Suarez keeps his eye on the ball as he attempts a volley during Barcelona training at the Etihad Stadium . ‘Having scored five goals at home against Newcastle is going to give us big confidence for taking on a team like Barcelona, who will try to score goals. The most important thing is to win the game without conceding goals at home. ‘In terms of possession of the ball, there are two things we have to think about. The first is we have got to try and get the ball back as quickly as we can and be very intense because they have very gifted, technical players. ‘The second thing — and it’s just as important — is that when we have the ball we can’t give it way cheaply. We have got to have very good concentration for 90, 95 minutes of the game.’ Wilfried Bony (left), Samir Nasri (centre) and Bacary Sagna (right) are put through their paces in training .

Instead Pellegrini will perhaps field the Brazilian duo Fernandinho and Fernando as defensive midfield shields in a bit to prevent the Barcelona forwards flooding on to City’s back four as easily as they did a year ago. It is another big Etihad occasion but in order to make it truly memorable, City really need to win.","Manchester City welcome La Liga club Barcelona to the Etihad on Tuesday .

"Angel di Maria has admitted that his form at Manchester United has dropped in recent weeks. United's record signing made a blistering start to his career in the Barclays Premier League but believes his recent struggles are just part of the settling in process. Di Maria told MUTV today: 'I've had a couple of games where things haven't gone as well as they could have. Manchester United playmaker Angel di Maria has struggled to impress in recent weeks . Di Maria, pictured with Luke Shaw and Wayne Rooney, was part of the side which lost to Swansea . The 27-year-old has not scored in the Premier League since United's 2-1 win against Everton in October . 'I think it's part of that settling in process to the English game. 'I started off quite well but I think that made expectations then rise and everyone thought that I would just carry on in the same way, but football is like that, sometimes you have these ups and downs. 'It took me a while to settle in fully in each of the countries where I've played before. 'But I just have to keep working hard and focusing on what I want, which is to do as well as I possibly can.' Last weekend's defeat at Swansea has left United hanging on grimly to the fourth Champions League place and ahead of Saturday's game at home to Sunderland, Di Maria has revealed that the mood at the club has been subdued. 'It's been OK,' he said. 'It's not quite as good as usual because you're not as happy as when you have won a game.

Juan Mata will be hoping to start against the Black Cats after making a late appearance against Swansea . 'But we have tried to keep our spirits up knowing that we have to keep fighting hard and aiming at staying as high up in the league table as we can. 'We were fortunate in the sense that not all of the teams just behind us won, so it meant that we could remain in the Champions League places and battling to climb higher in the table. 'We'd come off the back of a decent run of results, improving gradually along the way, these things can sometimes happen, not only to us. 'Chelsea had been going well recently but then drew their last game, it happens to everyone. 'It was unfortunate to lose a game after we'd been ahead, but now we have to concentrate on what we've been doing well in order to pick up that positive vibe once again. 'I think the season has been going quite well. 'We're in fourth place, fighting for a Champions League spot, which was the main aim, bringing Manchester United back into that competition.

"Jason Robinson admits that Wigan's World Cup Challenge victory in Brisbane 21 years ago took his own reputation to the next level. Now he believes the current crop of Super League stars can do the same this weekend. Robinson was only 19 when his solo try helped Wigan to a 20-14 victory in front of 54,000 people at Lang Park – now the ANZ Stadium - in 1994. One of the Australian commentators suggested at the time: 'They will make him the Mayor of Wigan after that'. Looking back this week, the former Wigan winger said: 'It's true that my reputation and standing in the game was different because of that match. If you can perform in a match like that then it immediately earns you respect. Jason Robinson (right) played more than 300 times for Wigan before switching to union in 2000 . Robinson was a huge hit in union and scored a superb try in England's 2003 World Cup final triumph . 'It was an incredible occasion back then, one of the highlights of my career. The fact that we won, did wonders for me and for the game over here.' This year's World Club Challenge is being played as a series. Super League winners St Helens face NRL champions South Sydney Rabbitohs at Langtree Park on Sunday but, prior to that, on Friday night and Saturday, Warrington Wolves face St George-Illawarra and Wigan Warriors entertain Brisbane Broncos once again. The new concept has attracted some scepticism but Robinson believes the three games offer the English game the opportunity to prove a point. 'This weekend is so important,' he added. 'Three games between some of the biggest clubs in the game. What's not to like about it? This is an enormous opportunity for Super League. South Sydney Rabbitohs captain Greg Inglis take a pass in training as his side prepare to face St Helens . 'Being a top player in Super League does not mean you are a big player in the world. But if you can put on a good show in games like this – especially if you win – than that changes. 'Will Brisbane fear Wigan, for example? No, they won't. 'But Wigan can give them a big surprise just like we did 20 years ago. That then begins to change things doesn't it? 'This is the opportunity for current Wigan players – and players at Warrington and St Helens – to write their own little bit of history. 'It would mean an awful lot to our game if we could do well this weekend. It generates immediate respect overseas. 'When you hear people talk, they all say that the NRL is the ultimate league. Maybe we can show them this weekend that the gulf isn't that big after all. Tom Burgess, brother of union convert Sam, makes a strong run during Rabbitohs training on Wednesday . 'As a player, in order to grow you have to be taken out of your comfort zone. Our teams will prepare this week maybe with a bit of fear factor. They will know they could get a hiding. 'But they also know they have a chance to come out the other side with their reputations enhanced. That is the one of the motivational factors for them. 'Personally, I think something good could happen for them this weekend. Rugby in this country will find out exactly where it stands this weekend and I am optimistic.' Robinson played more than 300 times for Wigan before switching to Rugby Union. He won a Union World Cup in 2003 with England but still rates the 1994 World Club success as one of his career highlights. Also in the Wigan team that night were legends such as Andy Farrell, Martin Offiah and Shaun Edwards. Current SKY analyst Phil Clarke and Widnes Vikings coach Denis Betts also played. On Saturday at the DW Stadium, Robinson will be present with many of his team-mates from that night in Brisbane to see if Shaun Wane's current side can repeat the triumph. Robinson is tackled by France flanker Thierry Dusautoir during the 2007 Rugby World Cup semi-final . 'Back then, to even go to Australia at the age of 19 was quite a big thing for me,' he recalled. 'But playing in that stadium, the pressure that we were under, the difficult style of play, that all added to the occasion. It was incredible. 'It was funny really because when we got there, we were immediately told to kick back a bit and take it easy. So we had a couple of nights out and maybe we let our hair down a bit too much! 'But then the reality kicked in. We were a good team and had just had a great year at home. 'But this was still a huge test for us. They could have taken us to the cleaners and we knew it. 'That threat was always there. The Australians had always set the levels. 'The players they had in their team were exceptional. Wendell Sailor, Glenn Lazarus, Andrew Gee, for example. These guys were serious players. 'But they key to it was the fact we knew – we believed – we had great players too. We went out there with that attitude and that was really important. Wigan will be without skipper Sean O'Loughlin (centre) for their clash against the Brisbane Broncos . 'We started well and got on the front foot and that was so important. We set our levels high in that game right from the start. 'I was lucky enough to score a try in the game and, for me, that was amazing. 'It's nearly 21 years ago but the memories are still there. They are still fresh. It remains a career highlight for me.' This weekend Wigan will be without skipper Sean O'Loughlin, who has a knee injury. Wigan also have the memories of a disappointing defeat in their corresponding game against Sydney Roosters in Australia a year ago to contend with. 'That will have hurt Wigan a lot,' said Robinson, whose 20-year-old son Lewis Tierney is on Wigan's books. 'But Shaun Wane will have them fired up for this, no doubt about that. 'Missing O'Loughlin is big for Wigan but they have Dan Sarginson back so that's a boost for them. 'Lewis has his head down and is working hard. He has not played many games but that's because the standard is so high. 'Wigan have a lot of very good young players. It's tough to get in that team.'

"Few things irritate great coaches more than suggestions that their teams are unsophisticated. It undermines everything they like to think they stand for. It pricks their ego. With this in mind, the moment Louis van Gaal walked in to a press conference room holding four pieces of A4 paper on Tuesday, it was always likely that an interesting 20 minutes or so lay ahead. The print-outs were Prozone stats sheets, breaking down the play from Manchester United's draw at West Ham on Sunday. The intention was to debunk the theory - raised by West Ham's Sam Allardyce after the weekend's game - that United had resorted to long-ball football at Upton Park. Louis van Gaal brandishes his dossier as he attempts to prove that Manchester United are not a long ball side . Van Gaal looks unimpressed as the Dutchman tells a packed press conference about his tactics . 'When a colleague of mine is saying this kind of thing then, yeah, you have to see the data and you have to put the data in the right context,' said Van Gaal. 'I have made an interpretation of the data for this game and then I have to say that it is not a good interpretation from Big Sam. It is not so difficult to read that. 'I give it you, you can copy it and then maybe you can go to Big Sam and he will get a good interpretation.' This sheet suggests United had a 56 per cent success rate of their 41 'long and forward' passes during the match at West Ham. The blue arrows indicate a successful pass . West Ham made just 11 of their 32 'long and forward' passes during the match, according to boss Van Gaal . Van Gaal claims United made 49.9 per cent of 'long passes forward' in comparison to West Ham's 71 per cent . This page suggests United played 12 long passes after 76 minutes of their 1-1 draw at Upton Park on Sunday. Eight of them were successful. Van Gaal's argument on Tuesday was clear. His team's long passes were, he said, aimed at spreading the play wide. They were not long, high deliveries up field. That only started, he added, when Marouane Fellaini came on with 20 minutes to go. 'We scored from that, so I think it was a very good decision of the manager,' Van Gaal added. It was a clear argument and one that didn't actually need the bits of paper and the red and blue arrows to explain. In truth, the whole intriguing spectacle perhaps said more about Van Gaal himself than it did about his team's football. An immediate comparison was made by many to Rafael Benitez's infamous 'facts' tirade back when his Liverpool team were challenging Sir Alex Ferguson's United in 2009. Benitez referred to a piece of paper that day, too. United's change of tack came after 6ft 4in Fellaini was brought on in the second half,  Van Gaal claimed . Van Gaal, pictured leaving the Upton Park pitch at half-time, flanked by Ryan Giggs and Albert Stuivenberg . On that occasion, however, Benitez just looked like a man buckling under pressure, a coach frazzled by the intensity of the duel with his great rival. Tuesday seemed to be about something else entirely. It seemed more like a coach seeking to protect a reputation forged by years spent at Ajax, Barcelona and Bayern Munich. It was as dismissive as it was carefully constructed. 'When you have 60% ball possession do you think that you can do that with long balls?' asked Van Gaal rhetorically. 'Yeah, long balls, in the width, to switch the play. You have to look at the data and then you will see that we did play long balls, but long balls wide, rather than to the striker. 'A ball straight up to the forward is long ball play. I am sorry, but we are playing ball possession play and after 70 minutes we did not succeed, in spite of many chances in the second half, so then I changed my playing style.' Whether Van Gaal's performance on Tuesday looked a little over the top is certainly a pertinent question. Only some improved football from his team will end an argument that is actually a lot wider than Van Gaal allowed it to be. The current issue about United's football is not restricted to the distance of their passes. It is more general than that. It is about entertainment and a coach's ability to get the best from his players. Is Van Gaal currently doing that? Few would say so. Daley Blind scores a late equaliser for Man United at Upton Park to rescue a 1-1 draw for Van Gaal's side . Cheikhou Kouyate opened the scoring for West Ham in their Premier League match against Man United . When a colleague of mine is saying this kind of thing then, yeah, you have to see the data and you have to put the data in the right context I believe. I think the media is also coming to the match and you have a lot of opinion about me, or the game, or the players and now you say that you have no opinion. When you have 0 per cent ball possession do you think that you can do that with long balls? Yeah, long balls, in the width, to switch the play. You have to look at the data and then you will see that we did play long balls, but long balls wide, rather than to the striker.  A ball to the forward striker is mainly caused by long-ball play. Because I expected this question, I have made an interpretation of the data for this game and then I have to say that it is not a good interpretation from Big Sam. It is not so difficult also to read that. I am sorry, but we are playing ball possession play and after 70 minutes we did not succeed, in spite of many chances in the second half, then I changed my playing style. Then, of course, with the quality of Fellaini we played more forward balls and we scored from that, so I think it was a very good decision of the manager. But, when you see overall the long ball, and what is the percentage of that, then West Ham have played 71 per cent of the long balls to the forwards and we 49. So, I give you this and you can see that the blue ones are the good ones because long balls are also very difficult, which is why I began with the explanation of ball possession. When you have 60 per cent ball possession you cannot play long balls. So again, they did it 71 and we 49, and I give it you, you can copy it and then maybe you can go to Big Sam and he will get a good interpretation. Wayne Rooney, for example, is currently playing in midfield and on his worst United scoring run since 2006. He may be relieved, at least, to hear Van Gaal say that his days as a striker are not necessarily over. 'No, it's dependable on the circumstances,' said the 62-year-old. 'How we are satisfied, or not, how he is satisfied, or not. It can change every week.' Asked next if entertainment was a priority Van Gaal was categorical. He said: 'You know that when you see my career I think that it is enough answer. 'I think we have played attractive games and less attractive games. With every club I think this is the case, so there's no discussion. 'In this world you have to win and play attractive, but that's not so simple. We do our best. Of course, we have never played with the same team because of injuries. Wayne Rooney was pushed out wide and into midfield by United boss Van Gaal at Upton park on Sunday . 'Still, when you see the fans against Cambridge United, there were a lot of them so they are obviously enjoying the games. 'When I am on the streets they show that to me, so I don't think that we are not playing attractive enough for the fans. 'I always applaud, so I think that everyone is still happy.' One interesting sub-plot ahead of Wednesday night's game against Burnley at Old Trafford is that in Opta's table of 'long passes', only the Lancashire club have played more than United this season. It's a label that irritates Burnley manager Sean Dyche, too. He referred to it as 'media myth' after his team's draw with West Brom on Sunday. It seems, then, that the thorny issue of long-ball football is one that raises the hackles of managers at both ends of the age and pay scale. Dyche has not resorted to bits of paper to defend himself, though. Not yet anyway.","Louis van Gaal produced a dossier at his press conference on Tuesday .

"Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal will contest the disrepute charge for criticising referee Chris Foy after his team’s FA Cup draw at Cambridge two weeks ago. Van Gaal said it was ‘always the same’ with referees when bigger teams play against smaller clubs, leading the FA to charge him with implying bias on Foy’s part. Now it has emerged the United manager will request a personal hearing with the governing body at which he will explain he was just trying to make a general point. Louis van Gaal hopes he won't have have the book thrown at him for comments made about referee Chris Foy . United take on West Ham away on Sunday and Van Gaal said: ‘I am not angry, I am very disappointed. I am now for nearly 30 years a trainer-coach or manager and I have never been charged. And still, up to now, I don’t think that I said something wrong. ‘I said already in our press conference (before the game) the same phrases, because I know in advance everything is in favour of the underdog. ‘I said it before the game and I said it after the game, only in the meaning of the general feeling of everybody, everybody for the underdog. ‘So I cannot imagine the FA has charged me. But, OK, it’s like that. Of course I will contest it. I never said anything wrong. You can confirm, as the media, that I never say anything about the referee, in all the matches.’ Van Gaal's men were held to a 0-0 draw against League Two team Cambridge United back in January . However the Red Devils did not let lightning strike twice and were 3-0 winners in the replay at Old Trafford . Van Gaal refused to buy in to former United manager Sir Alex Ferguson’s theory that the FA used to pick on the club simply because of its standing in the game. But it is clear he is irritated. United are, at least, in the next round of the FA Cup, having beaten Cambridge 3-0 in the replay at Old Trafford on Tuesday. That game featured an impressive cameo appearance from Spaniard Ander Herrera who has hardly played this season despite being bought for £29million in the summer. Van Gaal said: ‘He’s a great guy, he’s a great professional also, so that’s not the problem. His problem is he has to compete with high-level players. Wayne Rooney is the captain so he has a privilege (of always playing) — I have explained that — so then the other places... in this system, for example, that we are playing now, the No 10... that’s Juan Mata, that’s Angel di Maria. ‘That’s difficult to compete with, but he did already know that at the moment he signed. When you sign for a top club, he knows that he has to fight. But he is fighting.’ Former manager Sir Alex Ferguson (left) was believed United were treated harshly because of their profile . Ander Herrera (centre) has impressed i cameo appearances but faces stiff competition for a starting place . Di Maria, meanwhile, has continued to make himself available for selection despite the fact he and his family are living in a hotel following an attempted burglary at their home last weekend. ‘He is worried about his wife and child, but I have spoken with him and he wanted to play against Cambridge United and I played him,’ explained Van Gaal, who laid a wreath at Old Trafford yesterday as an act of remembrance for those who died in the Munich Air Disaster on February 6, 1958. ‘I have decided in the past that I will never play a player in those circumstances, because of the total human-being principle. But with him, I had the feeling that I had to give him a chance to play. He played well. And of course, I have to decide again when we face West Ham.’ Angel di Maria is available against West Ham despite a stressful  attempted burglary o his home .","Manchester United were forced into an FA Cup replay by Cambridge United .

"A 28-year-old woman from New York is set to become the first female to be given a try out for the NFL. Lauren Silberman had never kicked anything more than a soccer ball in an organised game before she started practicing long-range field goals. Now she has been given a chance at an NFL regional scouting combine on Sunday at the New York Jets' training facility in Florham Park, New Jersey. Scroll down for video . Lauren Silberman's NFL.com bio listed her as a former club soccer player at Wisconsin . Lauren Silberman, who has been handed a chance to make it into the NFL with a try out . Scouts are likely to want to Silberman her connect on extra points and chip-shot field goals with some consistency before moving on to the heavy kicking . It follows the success of Wisconsin-born Nascar driver Danica Patrick, 30, who became the first woman to start the Daytona 500 on pole position. Patrick's achievement sparked predictions she could become the first woman to win the 'Great American Race' in Florida, but she eventually finished eighth. Speaking about her chances of getting the NFL call, Silberman said: 'I am working hard to prepare but I am also realistic about my chances. 'I hope my willingness to put myself out there inspires others to seize opportunities and challenges. The support from around the world has been so heartening.' Her goal for the weekend is to kick perfect 60-yard field goals. However, the odds are against her - scouts are likely to want to see her connect on extra points and chip-shot field goals with some consistency before moving on to the heavy kicking. Silberman wrote her Master's thesis on how college and pro athletes can use video games to improve their athletic performance . Silberman (pictured with a friend) had never kicked anything more than a soccer ball in an organised game and she just started practicing long-range field goals . The 30-year-old Lauren Silberman, from New York, taking aim for a kick at an indoor session . Danica Patrick waves to fans as she walks down pit road before the start of the Nascar Daytona 500 . Silberman will compete against more accomplished or polished college kickers, all hoping to prove they have the leg strength and accuracy worthy of earning an invite to an NFL training camp. St Louis Rams kicker Greg Zuerlein participated in a regional combine last year before he was drafted and morphed into 'Legatron'. Cincinnati Bengals special teams coach Darrin Simmons said teams look for several things specifically when judging kickers in these situations. The most important is leg strength, followed by accuracy on field goals over 40 yards, and how they did on clutch kicks in college. Patrick won the pole at the Daytona 500, becoming the first woman to secure the top spot for any Sprint Cup race . 'When rating field goals, the deepest we test at the combine is a 50-yard field goal. There's not many attempts over 55 yards. 'We don't practice kicks much deeper than that - rarely do we do them,' Simmons said. 'You can tell after watching a 50-yard field goal how far the ball goes over the crossbar if they can hit from 55. 'They've got to be able to hit from 55. On kickoffs, they've got to be able to get the ball out of the back of the end zone.' The regional combines debuted in 2011, and feature players who weren't among the 333 invited to the main combine in Indianapolis. The league is holding these sessions in 10 cities this offseason, with the most impressive players advancing to a super-regional in April in Dallas. It's sort of the sports version of a TV reality show, where each hit and tackle can wow a scout and move a player on to the next round. Only instead of a recording contract, it's an NFL one. 'It's all up to those guys. If you're talented enough, you're going to get recognised. And if you put up good numbers, the numbers don't lie,' said Doug Whaley, assistant general manager/director of . player personnel for the Buffalo Bills. 'That's one of the things about the combine part of this business. It's the least subjective part of the business. And it's really objective, because you're looking at numbers.' Steve Rosner, a partner with 16W Marketing in New Jersey, said: 'The real upside is if she reaches the next level. 'Kickers, in general, aren't brands. Very rare. Even someone like Adam Vinatieri, who (has won) Super Bowls, would have to do a little more than kick to capitalise and endorse at the national level. 'The one thing she has that they don't have is that she's a woman. The uniqueness of her and the possible success she has will differentiate what she has at that position.' While a female has never played in the NFL, if the gender breakthrough did happen, it most likely would be at kicker. As a grad student at MIT, Silberman wrote her Master's thesis on how college and pro athletes can use video games to improve their athletic performance. She built upon the results of the study to start her own consulting firm, Double Play Media .","Lauren Silberman, 28, will kick at an NFL regional scouting combine .

"Martha Stewart has come under fire on Twitter after posting a picture of herself and controversial photographer Terry Richardson spending Thanksgiving together on Instagram. The 73-year-old domestic goddess shared the image, which also featured photographer Todd Eberle, on her account earlier today, commenting: 'Todd Eberle, left, Martha, and Terry Richardson, right at my farm on Thanksgiving. Each brought me an extraordinary flower photo!' Within minutes, Ms Stewart's account was flooded with comments from her followers, many of whom were horrified to see her associating with the photographer, who is facing more than a dozen accusations that he sexually abused young models while working with them on various photoshoots. 'Nothing says holiday like chilling with sex offenders': Martha has been slammed by her fans for her bizarre choice of dinner guest . Work colleagues: The pair met when Richardson photographed the 73-year-old for Porter Magazine earlier this year . The trio were joined at the 153-acre Westchester farm by Kevin Sharkey, Senior Vice President and Executive Editorial Director of Martha's eponymous company Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, Inc, who also shared an image of the group, saying: 'Todd, Martha, and Terry you couldn't ask for more amusing dinner partners.' But Martha's followers were not so thrilled to learn about her choice of dinner guests - and many couldn't resist the chance to share their thoughts. 'Nothing says holiday like chilling with sex offenders. Nice work lady,' Instagram user lambtoast commented, while b_shaurette said: 'Terry Richardson? Oh Martha, please say it ain't so.' 'Nooo!! I love you @marthastewart48, please remain the icon and trailblazer I know you are and say NO to any association with Terry Richardson!!' underdevon added. It is thought that Ms Stewart first met the photographer when he photographed her for fashion magazine Porter earlier this year. At the time, a spokesperson for the publication said of the unlikely pairing: 'It is the first time these two controversy-hounds have met but it is, like so much in Stewart’s life, no accident. 'After debating over a long list of photographers, America’s house-mother superior insisted that Richardson shoot her. ""Oh, he is cute,"" she will say later, when he comes to say goodbye.' The magazine, along with a number of other fashion publications, including Harper's Bazaar and Vogue, were last year targeted by an online petition calling for the fashion industry to cut ties with Richardson altogether, following a number of allegations from young models about his inappropriate and abusive behavior. Under fire: Valentino was criticized earlier this month for using Richardson in its newest fashion campaign .

Since the petition was published on Change.org by Londoner Alice Louse, both Vogue and fashion brand H&M have cut ties with the photographer. In a statement made to US Weekly, a spokesperson from Vogue said: 'The last assignment Terry Richardson had for US Vogue appeared in the July 2010 issue and we have no plans to work with him in the future.' Last week, high-end label Valentino was criticized by fashion fans after it released its Autumn Winter 2014 campaign, which features Richardson's distinctively-tattooed arms holding a number of brightly-colored accessories. It is the fourth time that the brand has worked with the photographer, who has also worked with the likes of Cara Delevingne, Miley Cyrus and Rihanna. Richardson has continued to deny the allegations made against him, writing on his blog: 'I just want to take a moment to say I’m really hurt by the recent and false allegations of insensitivity and misconduct. 'I've always been considerate and respectful of the people I photograph and I view what I do as a real collaboration between myself and the people in front of the camera.'","The TV star posted a picture of herself posing alongside Richardson to her Instagram account .

"U.S. President Barack Obama will not visit Kenya, the birthplace of his father, during his Africa tour . When President Barack Obama arrives in Africa this week, there will be one notable omission from his travel itinerary: Kenya, the birthplace of his father and home to many of his relatives. Concerns about Kenya's political situation have trumped Obama's family ties. Kenya's new president is facing charges of crimes against humanity in the International Criminal Court, accused of orchestrating the violence that marred the country's 2007 election. Ahead of Uhuru Kenyatta's victory earlier this year, a top Obama administration official warned Kenyans that their 'choices have consequences' - a remark that now appears prescient given the president's decision to skip a stop in his ancestral homeland. 'The optics of that, of a presidential trip, are not what he wants to be demonstrating right now,' said Jennifer Cooke, Africa director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The president will instead visit Senegal, South Africa and Tanzania, all countries that fit more neatly into the democracy and good governance message he'll tout during his week-long trip. Obama, first lady Michelle Obama and daughters Malia and Sasha are scheduled to depart Washington Wednesday morning. The White House did consider a visit to Kenya when they contemplated an African swing during the president's first term, before Kenyatta's election. That trip never happened, but Obama pledged that he would, in fact, visit Kenya before leaving office. 'I'm positive that before my service as president is completed I will visit Kenya again,' he said in a 2010 interview with Kenya's state broadcaster. White House officials say they respect the right of Kenyans to choose their own leaders. But deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said the U.S. also has 'a commitment to accountability and justice.' President Barack Obama, first lady Michelle Obama and their daughters Malia and Sasha (pictured last week returning from a trip to Ireland and Germany) are due to leave for Africa on Wednesday . 'Given the fact that Kenya is in the aftermath of their election and the new government has come into place and is going to be reviewing these issues with the ICC and the international community, it just wasn't the best time for the president to travel to Kenya,' Rhodes said. Kenya's government has been muted in its response to the president's decision to leave the county off his itinerary. 'It's for the Americans to decide where Obama goes,' spokesman Muthui Kariuki said. 'There are 54 nations on the African continent and he's only visiting three, so I don't see the real big deal about not going to Kenya.' But Sam Ochieng, a political activist who lives in Kibera, Nairobi's largest slum, said the U.S. president was sending a message about Kenya's political problems by putting democratic values ahead of his personal connections. 'It would be a shame for an American president to come to Kenya and shake dirty hands,' Ochieng said. By now, Obama's ties with Kenya are a well-known part of his unique family history. Barack Obama, Sr. was born in the western Kenyan village of Kogelo, moved to the U.S. to study, and met and married the president's mother in Hawaii. He left the family soon after his son was born. Return to his roots: Obama has not visited Kenya since 2006 when he was a senator (pictured) Obama made his first trip to Kenya in 1988, after his father's death, and wrote extensively about the visit in his memoir 'Dreams From My Father.' 'My name belonged and so I belonged, drawn into a web of relationships, alliances and grudges that I did not yet understand,' he wrote. The president visited Kenya two more times, most recently in 2006 as a freshman senator. He was greeted by cheering crowds in the capital of Nairobi and in Kogelo, where he spent time with his grandmother and visited his father's grave. He and wife Michelle Obama also publicly took HIV tests, part of their campaign at the time to reduce the stigma surrounding the virus. But Obama's nationally televised speech criticizing the government for failing to curb corruption or instill trust in its people earned him a cold shoulder from Kenya's leadership. Kenya's presidential spokesman said at the time that Obama was ignorant of Kenyan politics and had yet to form an understanding of foreign policy. Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta has been charged by the International Criminal Court as an 'indirect co-perpetrator' for the crimes of murder, deportation, rape and inhumane acts . Kenya is an important strategic partner for the U.S. in East Africa. But the recent election has complicated the relationship. Johnnie Carson, who until April served as head of the State Department's Africa bureau, said in the lead-up to this year's election that 'choices have consequences,' a comment that was viewed as a warning against electing Kenyatta. His remarks were widely criticized as an inappropriate intrusion into a sovereign nation's elections. Kenyatta, the son of the country's first president, has been charged by the ICC as an 'indirect co-perpetrator' for the crimes of murder, deportation, rape, persecution and inhumane acts allegedly committed by his supporters in the aftermath of the 2007 elections. He insists he is innocent of any wrongdoing. More than 1,000 people were killed in the ethnic violence that followed the flawed 2007 contest. The ICC has pushed back the start of Kenyatta's trial until Nov. 12. Kenyan deputy president William Ruto will also face similar charges at the international court in September.","Barack Obama will visit Senegal, South Africa and Tanzania on tour .

'I wanted an anchor – I craved it.  And when I had two wailing, smiling, joyful little blobs of waddling pink flesh, they became my entire existence and saved me from one of pure apathy.' Peaches went on to say how having babies meant that her friends, apart from her five closest friends, deserted her, leaving her feeling 'alienated and abandoned', and wondering if she had made a mistake.

"A Blond robber in dark glasses  casually points a gun at a terrified  bank manager as she claims a stack of gold bullion. It may sound like the kind of scene you would hope to shield youngsters from – but this is actually a toy set aimed at children from four to ten. Anti-gun campaigners have hit out at Playmobil over its Bank and Safe pack, which comes with all the pieces needed to stage a violent heist, including a safe that opens to reveal a haul of valuables and armed bank robber figurines. Child's play: The blonde-haired doll points a gun at the bank manager as he hands over the gold bullion in the Playmobil Bank and Safe set which re-enacts a bank robbery . The German manufacturer claims the toy, on sale for around £35, encourages children to ‘imagine, invent, create’. But Danny Bryan of Communities Against Gun and Knife Crime, which works . to help youngsters avoid lives  of violence, said: ‘We don’t want to be . encouraging young people to look at these sorts of things. 'I think it is . horrendous that young people are given all these images to shape them. It is sending out the wrong message.’ Aimed at . children aged four to 10, the set includes gold bars, cash, a big bag to . put the loot in, a pistol and a screwdriver to wrench open the cash . point machine. Smash and grab: The set, now on sale at Toys R Us, has raised eyebrows among the anti-gun community about the message it is sending our children . Heist at home: Aimed at children, the set is suitable for four to ten-year-olds but anti-gun campaigner Danny Bryan said it was 'horrendous' A description of the set on The Early Learning Centre website read: ‘Watch out. The bank . robber is after all the money in the bank and is demanding the key to . the safe - what will the bank manager do?’ The centre writes that the set is not . suitable for children under four-years-old - due to small parts, never . mind the re-acting of a violent crime. A Toys R Us spokesperson was unavailable to comment. German company Playmobil has caused controversy before, manufacturing construction worker play sets which come complete with shovels, tools and three crates of what appears to be beer. And this is not the first time toys have been considered controversial and inappropriate before. Impressionable age: Mr Bryan said it is 'horrendous that young people are given all these images to shape them' Last year police swooped on a shopkeeper’s business and seized a cache of gun-shaped calculators because they feared they could be used in a robbery. The 30 calculators were among a haul of toy guns confiscated by police in a raid on a warehouse in Sherborne, Dorset, which is owned by shopkeeper Mark Ashley Miller. Mr Ashley-Miller, who runs the gift shop The Present Finder, was stunned when officers descended on his warehouse and confiscated £1,140 of stock. They were seized after someone saw the toys on sale on The Present Finder’s website and made a complaint to firearms police. Back in 2007 Lego upset fans by giving some of its play figures, including stormtroopers, robots and Batman characters, realistic-looking guns and pistols.

"Hunting for clothes in busy shops can be a nightmare, while shopping online can be a bit hit-and-miss. Now eBay has fitted futuristic ‘magic mirrors’ in a popular designer shop in a bid to blur the line between physical and digital shopping - and to make finding the perfect outfit more fun. The ‘connected store’ in New York includes a shopping wall that shows video content to inspire customers on outfit choices. While interactive mirrors in the fitting rooms are used to order items and will even change the lighting so it’s more flattering. Scroll down for video . Future of shopping? eBay has fitted futuristic ‘magic mirrors’ (pictured) in Rebecca Minkoff's New York shop in a bid to blur the line between shopping in a store and online and make the experience more enjoyable . The online retailer has teamed up with Rebecca Minkoff to transform her shop in SoHo into a high tech shopping hub, with shops in San Francisco and Los Angeles to follow shortly. It features ‘connected walls’, which are mirrored displays showing video content designed to inspire shoppers. Users swipe through looks and touch the screen to ask store staff to fill dressing rooms with the clothes they like - and even order drinks. An interactive fitting room mirror then acts like a personal stylist and suggests matching accessories to go with an item of clothing that a shopper has in the room with them. Shoppers can also tap the mirror to change the lighting. The rooms use radio frequency identification (RFID) technology to recognise all the items of clothing in the room and offer alternative sizes and colours that are available to buy. Interactive fitting room mirrors act like a personal stylist and can suggest matching accessories to go with an item of clothing that a shopper has in the room with them (pictured) App: The app allows shoppers to check in to a store so staff can see their personal profile and suggest clothes that they will like. Shopping wall: Shoppers can see inspiring digital content on huge mirrored walls and send clothes they like to a fitting room to initiate a digital styling session. Magic mirrors: Touch screen mirrors in the fitting rooms identify clothes in different sizes and colours that are in stock. It can hint at matching items too. Steve Yankovich, Head of Innovation and New Ventures at eBay, said: ‘If you bring five things into a dressing room and they don’t work, you might be tempted to leave a store. ‘But what if you could determine the availability of different colours and sizes and request them from associates while still in the dressing room? ‘The Connected Store’s fitting rooms will make that possible through smart surfaces that can even suggest entire outfits to try.’ Shoppers can mull over options by taking their selection with them in the form of images stored in a dedicated app. It allows consumers to build personal profiles of their favourite items, which can be purchased later. Using this technology, the shop can recognise individual customers, allowing staff to make personal recommendations, and track what people have brought. Mr Yankovich believes that the Rebecca Minkoff store is the first step in ‘big changes in retail’. The shop features ‘connected walls’ (pictured) which are mirrored displays showing video content designed to inspire shoppers. Consumers swipe through looks and touch the screen to ask store staff to fill dressing rooms with the clothes they like, and even order drinks . ‘Displays, video and connected touch walls can make seeing what products look like in actual use much more engaging and true to life [than mannequins].’ He explained that eBay’s aim is to turn a store in ‘your’ store . ‘eBay is building shopping experiences where consumers can notify a store that they are coming and the associates can have personalised choices available near a smart dressing room before they even arrive. ‘These white glove experiences are going to entirely shift consumer experiences.' Other shops have in the past experimented with technology in fitting rooms that have been used for everything from scanning a person’s body to find clothes that fit, to allowing users to have their chosen items delivered to their home so they don’t have to carry them. There is also a new generation of smartphone apps that put colour-matching and ‘digital stylist’ options in users’ hands no matter which shop they are in. While stores might be getting smarter, there is already a free app that lets shopper find matching clothes at different price points and in precise shades. The Snap ColourPop iPhone app lets users search for clothes and shoes in exactly the same colour as any object or inspirational landscape of their choice. Users of the app take a photograph of their chosen object using their smartphone camera and the app searches for clothes and accessories from 150 UK fashion retailers such as Net-a-Porter, Miss Selfridge and M&S, to find fashion items in exactly the same shade. The Snap ColourPop iPhone app lets users search for clothes and shoes in exactly the same colour as any object or inspirational landscape of their choice. On the left, a user photographs a sweet and on the right, the app suggests a dress in the same colour that a shopper can buy instantly from one of 150 stores . It does this using a specially developed algorithm that combs through over 120,000 products in seconds – depending on your internet connection – to find an exact, or close colour match. The app claims to match shades of colours as closely as possible to the original photo, which means it could prove a quick solution for people wanting to find perfectly matching shoes to go with the rest of their outfit, without being restricted to a single shop. When the fashion items found by the app are displayed, they can be filtered by clothing types, such as dresses or shirts and can either be purchased immediately or saved for later in a ‘wishlist’ which can inform shoppers if the price of the item drops. The app is the first commercial product to use visual search technology to help people shop and Jenny Griffiths, a 27-year-old computer scientist, believes it will change the way people buy clothes in the future.","eBay technology is embedded in Rebecca Minkoff's New York shop .

"A guide dog died after pushing a four-year-old child out of harm’s way from a speeding car that ran a stop sign in Atlanta, Georgia, on Monday. Dave Furukawa, the visually-impaired owner of the 80-pound black boxer, was walking his son, Will, to school when the accident happened. As they crossed Brownwood Avenue in southeast Atlanta, witnesses saw a red Chrysler run a stop sign and strike Simon, the guide dog, then Furukawa. Scroll down for video... Hero: Simon, the guide dog, died after he pushed a 4-year-old boy out of the path of a car that ran a stop sign . Sad: The dog's owner, Dave Furukawa, misses his canine companion . Happy family: Furukawa and his son, Will, and Simon snuggle up together a few years ago. They said that Simon's protective instinct kicked in, despite injuries that would prove to be fatal. ‘Simon either got up or jumped out, and pushed my son out of the path of the car,’ Furukawa told WXIA. 'This was true loyalty and courage,' he added. 'He loved my son.' Bystanders took Will and ran him down the street to the family home. And while Simon was dying from internal bleeding, the faithful dog still followed them home to make sure the child and his owner were safe. ‘Broken leg, gash on his side and internal bleeding, but he followed home,’ said Furukawa. ‘Once he was sure Will was okay, he laid down.’ Accident: The incident that killed Simon happened at the stop sign on  Brownwood Avenue in southeast Atlanta . 'True loyalty': Furukawa said his dog showed real courage by saving his son . Injuries: Simon died from internal bleeding after being hit by the car .

"A chilling audio recording of a phone call likely made by Newtown killer Adam Lanza to a radio show a year before his deadly rampage gives a terrifying look inside the 20-year-old's sick mind. Lanza apparently spoke on Oregon college radio show Anarchy Radio on December 11, 2011 and compared a chimpanzee that famously tore off the face a Connecticut woman to a human mass killer. 'I just... don't think it would be such a stretch to say that he very well could have been a teenage mall shooter or something like that,' he said about Travis the chimp in a recording, which was first reported by Sandy Hook Lighthouse. Although he disguised his voice and used the name Greg, friends said the recording sounds just like the killer. And online discussions by an internet forum user called Smiggles - a name known to be used by Lanza - also nod at the eerie call being made by him. Scroll down to hear Lanza speak... 'Travis wasn’t an untamed monster at all': Sandy Hook killer Adam Lanza (right) professed a bizarre affinity with Connecticut chimpanzee Travis (left), who tore off a woman's face in 2009, as he called a radio show . Lanza spoke for some seven minutes in a . soft voice to host John Zerzan, whose fringe worldviews . somehow kept him from seeing just how bizarre and frightening Lanza's . statements truly were. He spoke about Travis the chimp, who made headlines in 2009 . after ripping off the face and arm of a Connecticut . woman named Charla Nash. She would later receive a face transplant. 'His . attack can be seen entirely parallel to the attacks and random acts of . violence that you bring up on your show every week, committed by humans, . which the mainstream also has no explanation,' Lanza said. 'Travis wasn’t an untamed monster at all,' caller 'Greg' said. 'Um, he wasn’t just feigning domestication, he was civilized. Um, he was able to integrate into society. Violent: Travis's attack left Charla Nash . horribly disfigured (right), though the radio caller - believed to be . Adam Lanza - says the animal was just misunderstood by society . Chilling: Anarchy Radio host John Zerzan, pictured, said he did not find anything alarming about the call . '[Travis] didn't really act any differently than a human child would and the people who would use that as an indictment against having chimps live as humans do wouldn't apply the same thing to humans so it's just kind of irrelevant.' Zerzan, 70, of Eugene, Oregon remembers the call but somehow found nothing alarming about it. 'There's nothing there indicating he was considering something so heinous and inconceivable,' Zerzan told The New York Daily News. 'It was a year before Sandy Hook, so no one has any idea what he was thinking a year before…I don't see how anyone could have guessed that with what was said.' Connecticut authorities would not confirm that the recordings were of Lanza. But a trail of internet forum comments and evidence collected in the sprawling investigation strongly suggest it was. Evidence: In this digital evidence report, Lanza's forum name is listed as 'Smiggles' - the same user who commented about speaking on the radio show . Red flags: Lanza regularly shared messages on the forum, including this about feeling schizophrenic . Confirmed: Kyle Kromberg (pictured), who went to school with Lanza, said the voice is definitely his . A . public safety investigation report on Lanza's shooting spree - which left 20 students . and six teachers at Sandy Hook Elementary dead - . indicates Lanza was known to use the alias Smiggles on internet forums. On . the discussion board Shocked Beyond Belief, user Smiggles wrote about . Zerzan just before the call believed to be from Lanza was made. 'I should call in on John Zerzan's radio program about Travis,' Smiggles wrote. 'I'm . really surprised that I haven’t been able to find anything he’s written . or said about the incident, considering how often he brings up random . acts of violence. It seems like Travis would be a . poster-chimp of his philosophy.' Smiggles also posted about the call the next day. 'It didn’t go as horribly as I . anticipated. I wish that I hadn’t spoken nonstop about Travis for so . long, but I didn’t want to seem crazy by randomly bringing up a . chimpanzee for unknown reasons,' Smiggles wrote. Killer: Adam Lanza shot himself dead after his deadly rampage on December 14, 2012 in Newtown . Just a year before: The call was made December 11, 2011, almost a year to the day that Lanza went on his armed rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary in the most shocking mass shooting in American memory . In another post on the same site, he wrote: 'Well, I feel schizophrenic.' In . addition to the internet evidence trail, friends and associates of . Lanza's have also confirmed the recordings are of the killer. 'As soon as he opened his mouth (in the audio clip), I knew it was him,' Kyle Kromberg, 21, told the Daily News. Kromberg . attended high school with Lanza for years and spoke to him each day. Another friend confirmed the recording was of Lanza, as well. 'Yes, I think it’s him,' said the unidentified friend. 'It does sound like something he would say. But he is talking funny.'","Friends and an internet trail identify Lanza as the caller on Anarchy Radio nearly a year to the day before the Sandy Hook massacre .

London Heathrow (£26) 2. London Stansted (£23.40) 3. London Gatwick (£17.70) 4. London Luton (£15.50) 5. Bristol (£7) 6. Manchester (£4.80) 7. Southampton (£3.50) 8. Birmingham (£3.50) 9. Newcastle (£3.30) 10. Glasgow (£3.30) Journeys between Newcastle airport and Newcastle city centre on the Tyne and Wear Metro service and Glasgow airport to the city centre on Scotrail cost just £3.30. All transfer services listed by flightriight.co.uk were those advertised as the most recommended by individual airport’s official websites. In contrast, Europe’s cheapest airport transfer was between Pisa International airport and Pisa city centre, where a one-way bus journey costs just 94p. Marek Janetzke, Managing Director of flightright, commented: ‘It’s easy to get caught out by high train fares so travellers should plan ahead to find the most cost effective way of getting to and from the airport. ‘Flying can be expensive and travellers should remember that it’s easy to get money back in compensation if there are issues with your journey such as flight delays.’ Travelling between Paris Orly Airport and Paris city centre costs just £5.89 on the VAL metro service . Heathrow Express said that travellers could purchase one-way tickets between Heathrow and Paddington for £15 if booked a week in advance. A Heathrow Express spokesman said: 'Depending on time pressure and budget, there many options for people travelling between central London and Heathrow. 'The 17,000 people a day who use our premium service pay for its speed, reliability and comfort. 'Cheaper alternatives include the Heathrow Connect stopping service and the Tube. Pricier options include taxis. 'In the latest National Rail Passenger Survey, our customers gave us an 'overall satisfaction' rating of 94 percent - second best in the rail industry. Heathrow Express added that when measured per mile, some European transfer services are more expensiv. For example passengers travelling between Frankfurt's main station and the airport costs £10.38 for 5.6 miles - or £1.85 per mile. Travelling 15 miles from Paddington to Heathrow, the Heathrow Express is £1.40 per mil if a £21 ticket is bought.","London airports have four of top five costliest journeys to city centre .

"One average, normal guy conjured instant celebrity for himself in New York's Times Square by hiring fake bodyguards, paparazzi and an entourage to follow him round the streets of the Big Apple. Fooling the notoriously savvy natives into believing that he was indeed famous, 21-year-old student Brett Cohen caused a 300 person pile up at 'The Cross Roads of The World' as he posed for photographs with groups of giggling girls. The slightly disturbing prank was conducted to expose the public's fascination with celebrity and members of the public tripped over themselves to get a peek and a picture with the man at the centre of attention for all the flashing paparazzi's cameras. Scroll Down for Video . Creating a buzz: Brett Cohen is just about to exit the NBC studios at Rockefeller Center and begin his social experiment . Beginning outside NBC's studios at the Rockefeller Center on July 27th, SUNY New Paltz student Brett Cohen left the famous '30 Rock' building accompanied by two bodyguards he had hired on Craigslist, three cameramen and four photographers. According to the plan, which was cooked up by Cohen and his friend, Edward Strum, 23, the photographers and members of the entourage would start talking about 'Brett Cohen' being inside NBC's studios, to create a buzz among passers-by. Exiting the venerable studios to the strobing of photographers flashes, Cohen stands outside as the crowd of people begins to grow. He then begins to make his way across the city towards the jumbotrons and neon lights of Times Square. As Brett Cohen (visible centre) appears outside,  his hired paparazzi begin to take photographs which attract the attention of a large crowd . All smiles: Brett Cohen with his two fake bodyguards is followed up Manhattan as he makes his way to the iconic Times Square . 'It was a social experiment,' said Cohen to ABC News. 'It confirms the theory of how our culture is so obsessed with celebrity and fame.' As he makes his way through the centre of Manhattan, Cohen is stopped by screaming girls all wondering who he is, but more importantly not caring as they cosy-up for pictures with the 'celebrity'. When asked if he knows Brett Cohen, one man claims to have heard his new single which he thinks is quite good. Another man is convinced that Cohen is going to be the 'next bog thing'. 'I think he's excellent, I think he's gonna be awesome, I think he's got a great future in the movie business,' said the enthusiastic man. 'I just took a picture with him, I feel special.' As soon as Cohen and his entourage reach Times Square girls flock to him - attracted by the attention lavished on him by the paparazzi and his assumed celebrity . The pressures of fame: A girl in Times Square beams as she has her picture taken with Brett Cohen (left) while another fan poses with the student (right) What film were you in again? Another group of girls requests a picture with Cohen . However, it is the adulation that Cohen receives from girls that really catches the eye as he parades around Times Square. A gaggle of giggling teenagers are asked what they think of him: 'Amazing, I love him,' said one girl, while another openly screams out 'Can I just say that he's beautiful.' The video opens with Cohen walking around Times Square in just a T-shirt and shorts looking every inch a normal person. 'My whole life, I've always wondered what it would be like to be famous,' explains Cohen in a voiceover. One man (left) feels special to have seen the 'movie star' Cohen - while another (right) believes that he has heard the student's latest single . The adulation begins to overwhelm Cohen as his bodyguards take charge of the situation . With his team of 15 hired hands, Cohen experienced first hand the adulation and attention that Lady GaGa and Justin Bieber deal with on a daily basis. 'I had photographers follow me around and act as paparazzi,' said Cohen. 'There were 15 people in total that were actually in on it. No planted fans or anything like that. Everything you see in the video is completely real. 'I had to pretend like all of this was normal. That was one of the hardest parts. 'And plus smiling for all those pictures, I took around 300 pictures. 'Some people kept coming up to me again and again. My face really hurt by the end of it. I thought my face was going to freeze in that smile.' Spending three hours in Times Square, Cohen became nervous that the large crowd of people who had gathered to see the commotion would attract the attention of the NYPD. Eventually after three hours, Cohen ends his experiment - leaving behind his entourage and team to become just another average person . 'We were nervous police would get involved because why would a celebrity just walk through Times Square like that?' said Cohen. 'Two cops walked up to me and I was so nervous, but they just asked if they could take a picture.' Eventually though, Cohen decided that his social experiment had gone far enough. Despite not one person in his team actually saying that he was famous, Cohen felt it was time to give them the slip. 'It was really hard to end the shoot. How the hell do you stop when there’s so many people following you?' said Cohen. 'We actually had to walk away from Times Square and into a small hotel. Earlier in the day, Cohen had scouted out Times Square to see how his prank might play out . 'One of my bouncers blocked off the door to the bar to keep the public from going in. 'It was the only way we were able to stop it.' And now ironically, Cohen is himself a little famous because of his stunt, but was modest when asked about the hordes of women who lavished him with attention that night. 'No, I have a girlfriend. I am very loyal,' said Cohen.","Student Brett Cohen's 15-minutes of fame was intending to be a social experiment into the public's fascination with celebrity .

"A new clothing company allows fashion lovers to rent jeans on a monthly basis - and then trade them in for a new pair when they get bored of wearing them. Holland-based brand Mud Jeans, the brainchild of Dutch entrepreneur Bert van Son, leases a variety of different styles of jeans for the bargain price of $7.40 per month, and then recycles any returned products in order to create new clothing designs and accessories, from sweaters to shoulder bags. The company even offers a free repair service to customers who damage their jeans during the lease period. 'It's about being on trend': Mud Jeans invites customers to lease their favorite pair for a monthly fee - and then return them when they get bored . Suitable for everybody: The company offers products for both men and women . 'The idea favors usage over ownership, tapping into a new consumer philosophy,' Mr van Son told Co.Exist. 'It's about being on trend without ever actually owning clothes.' Having successfully trialed the concept in the Netherlands, the entrepreneur and his son Michiel Van Son are now trying to raise the funds needed to bring the idea to the United States. Thus far, the pair have raised just under $15,000 via their Kickstarter page and are hoping that the business - and its core ideals - will soon be ready to go global. 'We’re the first brand to introduce a rental system for jeans,' the page explains. 'All returned jeans are recycled. Why? Recycling diminishes the amount of waste, water and consumption of raw materials.' Michiel adds: 'My father’s dream started two years ago when he launched Mud Jeans. With 30 years of experience in the textile industry, he was frustrated by business models founded on the presumption of unlimited and cheap natural resources. It was time for a change. 'He wanted to tap into a new consuming philosophy, one based on using instead of owning. People have always rented cars and washing machines, so why wouldn’t they lease jeans?' In addition to the jeans, fashion fans can also lease hoodies and shoulder bags, all of which are made from organic materials and produced using only the most eco-friendly methods. 'Mud Jeans wanted to challenge itself by designing denim that requires less production water,' the brand description says. 'After many samples, we’re proud to introduce DRY MUD. Probably the driest denim in the world! Unwashed denim needs less maintenance. 'Unwashed denim needs less maintenance': Customers are encouraged to only wash their jeans after wearing them for a few months . Money-makers: Mud Jeans' founders Bert and Michiel van Son are hoping to raise enough money to set up a base for their business in the US . 'Mud Jeans encourages you to wait months before you first wash them and even longer for the next wash. The men’s product is a 12.5 ounce denim made from 30% recycled denim and 70% organic cotton. The women’s is made from 98% organic cotton and 2% elastane for extra comfort.' Eventually the brand's creators hope to have bases in various locations around the world and are eager to establish what they refer to as 'Mud Recycle Hubs', where customers can return their old jeans for recycling before selecting a new pair. 'You can enjoy DRY MUD for as long as you like, keeping in mind that each pair belongs to Mud,' the website states. 'Once they're worn out, you can pick out a new pair and send back the old. New denim yarn is born when returned jeans are shredded and blended with virgin cotton. From this yarn new products are made...'","Mud Jeans leases trousers for $7.40 per month and offers a free repair service to customers .

"The rusty bronze fragments of the Antikythera Mechanism, the world's oldest computer, are 100 years older than scientists previously thought. This is according to Argentinian researchers who found that an eclipse prediction calendar - a dial on the back of the mechanism - includes a solar eclipse that happened on May 12, 205 B.C. Previous radiocarbon dating analysis of the remarkable mechanism had provided a later construction date of around 100 to 150 BC. Scroll down for video . The Mechanism (pictured) was recovered from a Roman cargo shipwreck off the Greek island of Antikythera. Previous studies have shown it was used to chart the movement of planets and the passing of days and years. Scans in 2008 found that it may also have been used to predict eclipses . The study, by the National University of Quilmes, suggests that the process in which the computer predicts eclipses is Babylonian arithmetic, rather Greek trigonometry. This ancient device 'predates other known examples of similar technology by more than 1,000 years,' according to a report by John Markoff in the New York Times. The highly complex mechanism, made up of up to 40 bronze cogs and gears, was used in ancient times to track the cycles of the solar system. It was recovered in 1900 from the Antikythera wreck - a Roman cargo shipwreck off the Greek island of Antikythera. Scans of the mechanism in 2008 found that it may also have been used to predict eclipses, and record important events in the Greek calendar, such as the Olympic Games. The scans also revealed the mechanism was originally housed in a rectangular wooden frame with two doors, covered in instructions for its use. At the front was a single dial showing the Greek zodiac and an Egyptian calendar. On the back were two further dials displaying information about lunar cycles and eclipses. The calculator would have been driven by a hand crank. Earlier this year, an expedition led by the Greek government returned to the ancient shipwreck of Antikythera using the Exosuit - a state-of-the art, deep sea diving suit . Antikythera (highlighted) which now has a population of only 44, was once one of antiquity's busiest trade routes, and a base for Cilician pirates, some of whom once captured and held the young Julius Caesar for ransom. He later had them all captured and crucified . The device could track the movements of Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn - the only planets known at the time, the position of the sun, and the location and phases of the moon. The researchers have been able to read all the month names on a 19-year calendar on the back of the mechanism. Scientists have suggested that the mechanism might have been somehow linked to Archimedes, after a study found that language inscribed on the device. The inscriptions suggested it had been manufactured in Corinth or in Syracuse, where Archimedes lived. But Archimedes was killed in 212 B.C., while the ship carrying the device is believed to have sunk between 85 and 60 B.C. 'If we were all taking bets about where it was made, I think I would bet what most people would bet, in Rhodes,' Alexander Jones, a specialist in the history of ancient mathematical sciences told New York Times. Earlier this year, an expedition led by the Greek government returned to the ancient shipwreck of Antikythera using the Exosuit - a state-of-the art, deep sea diving suit. The group used the Exosuit to more than double the depth they can dive at, and stay safely at the bottom for longer. They brought back tableware, parts of the ship and a bronze spear. The now plan to dive again next spring in the hopes of uncovering more clues about the Antikythera Mechanism's history. An exact replica of the Antikythera Mechanism is displayed in Corinth, Peloponnese in Greece . The Mechanism was recovered in 1900 from the Antikythera wreck - a Roman cargo shipwreck off the Greek island of Antikythera. It was discovered in a wooden box measuring 13 inchesx7 inchesx3.5 inches (340×180×90mm) and consists of bronze dials, gears and cogs. A further 81 fragments have since been found containing a total of 40 hand-cut bronze gears. The mechanism is said to have been created in around 100BC, and is believed to be the world's oldest calculator. Previous studies have shown that it was used to chart the movement of planets and the passing of days and years. Scans of the mechanism in 2008 found that it may also have been used to predict eclipses, and record important events in the Greek calendar, such as the Olympic Games. Astronomer Professor Mike Edmunds of Cardiff University said at the time: 'It is more complex than any other known device for the next 1,000 years.' The scans also revealed the mechanism was originally housed in a rectangular wooden frame with two doors, covered in instructions for its use. At the front was a single dial showing the Greek zodiac and an Egyptian calendar. On the back were two further dials displaying information about lunar cycles and eclipses. The calculator would have been driven by a hand crank. The mechanism recorded several important astronomical cycles known to the Babylonians hundreds of years before that help predict eclipses. These include the Saros cycle - a period of around 18 years separating the return of the moon, Earth and sun to the same relative positions. The device could track the movements of Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn - the only planets known at the time, the position of the sun, and the location and phases of the moon. The researchers have been able to read all the month names on a 19-year calendar on the back of the mechanism. The month names are Corinthian - suggest that it may have been built in the Corinthian colonies in north-western Greece or Syracuse in Sicily. The device was created at a time when the Romans had gained control of much of Greece. The Mechanism is on display at the National Archaeological Museum in Athens.","This is according to Argentinian scientists who found eclipse calendar .

"Mrs Pushkar Tharoor appeared to detail an affair, but a statement later said the tweets were unauthorised and her marriage was a happy one . The wife of an Indian government minister has been found dead in her room at a luxury New Delhi hotel following reports she had hacked into her husband's Twitter account and published a series of romantic messages between him and a Pakistani journalist. The body of Sunanda Pushkar Tharoor, 52, was discovered by her husband Shashi Tharoor who was called after cleaners were unable to get inside the room at the plush Leela Palace hotel. Mr Tharoor's personal assistant Abhinav Kumar told reporters: 'She was lying in bed. There were no signs of any foul play or any struggle. She had no sign of poisoning or anything'. Mr Kumar said Mr Tharoor returned to the hotel at 8.30 pm and had to have the door opened by hotel authorities. He discovered his wife lying on the bed. He had initially thought his wife was asleep but when he went to check on her, he found that she was dead. Mr Tharoor was being questioned by police late on Friday night. Her death comes just one day after she and her husband released a joint statement on Facebook claiming they were still happily married and intended to stay together. Mrs Pushkar Tharoor, had reportedly hacked the Twitter account of her husband, who is India's junior human resources minister, and published romantic messages apparently between him and journalist Mehr Tarar to his two million followers.

Ms Tarar strongly denied . sending the messages and any suggestion that she was in a relationship . with Mr Tharoor. But Mrs Pushkar Tharoor had told India's Economic Times newspaper that she had published the tweets to show the world how Ms Tarar was 'stalking' her husband. Shashi Tharoor and Sunanda Pushkar Tharoor are seen at their wedding in 2010.

"The traditional elevator has had its day. More than 160 years since cables and hoists were used on the very first lift systems in buildings, engineers have designed an alternative that uses magnets. The setup uses magnetic levitation, or maglev, to pull elevator cabins horizontally as well as vertically quickly and smoothly. Scroll down for video . Called Multi, the technology (illustrated) has been developed by ThyssenKrupp. The firm believes it will transform how people move inside buildings. Each of the cabins are self-propelled using a multi-level brake system. They transfer power from the shaft to the cabin using a magnetised coil running along the shaft . Called Multi, the technology has been developed by ThyssenKrupp. It is reminiscent of the floating glass elevator seen in the 1971 film Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, based on Roald Dahl's book. The German-based firm believes Multi will transform how people move inside buildings, reduce waiting times for passengers, and take up less space. Each of the cabins are self-propelled using a multi-level brake system and transfer power from the shaft to the cabin and back again. A magnetised coil running along the elevator shaft repels magnets on the outside of the cabins. This allows the cabins to levitate above this so-called guideway. Power is then moved along the coils in the guideway to pull and push the cabin up and down, or left and right. This current changes to accommodate differences in polarity needed to keep the cabins in motion and moving in the correct direction. A magnetised coil running along the elevator shaft repels magnets on the outside of the cabins.This allows the cabins to levitate above this so-called guideway. The technology is currently used to propel Maglev trains (pictured) in Japan capable of reaching speeds of up to 310mph (498km/h) This causes a magnetic field in front of the cabin to pull it forward, while a field at the rear adds thrust. Because the cabins don’t touch the guideway, there is less friction meaning the ride is faster and smoother, and can also reduce energy.

It will be officially tested in a tower in Rottweil, Germany. This tower is set to be completed at the end of 2016, and until then the firm is testing prototypes at its Essen headquarters.","Called Multi, the technology has been developed by ThyssenKrupp .

"Latin American countries could stop deploying law enforcement agencies to fight cartels after concluding that the human costs of the 'war on drugs' is just too high. That is just one of the scenarios envisaged in a 'gamechanging' report on global drugs policy released by the Organisation of American States. Commissioned at last year's Cartagena Summit of the Americas the report calls for a discussion in  decriminalization of drug use and for greater coordination between nations in tackling the scourge. Game-changer: Latin American countries could stop deploying law enforcement agencies to fight cartels after concluding that the human costs of the 'war on drugs' is just too high . Many in Latin America feel a new . approach is needed to the drug war - and a shift away from hard-line . policies - after decades of violence in producer and trafficking nations . such as Colombia, Peru and Mexico. Some regional leaders are pressuring the United States for an overhaul of anti-drug policies and have suggested they might be open to legalisation of some narcotics if that helped reduce violence. The 200 page review references a number of South American countries would break with the . prohibition line and decide that they will no longer deploy law . enforcement and the army against drug cartels after deeming the human cost of life too high. 'The report presented by the OAS today is a vital piece in the construction of a common way to fight this problem,' Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said during the presentation. Battle: Earlier this month Obama defended his administration's efforts to stem U.S. demand for drugs that many regional leaders see as a driving factor in their security issues . Latin America suffers the brunt of consequences of the drug war. Keeping track of the drug deaths is difficult, as official figures have been issued sporadically but in Mexico alone, upwards of 70,000 people have died in drug-related violence over the past six years. The government stresses that Mexico's . murder rate is still lower than several nations, including Honduras, . Guatemala, Brazil and Venezuela. Drug-related violence has plagued Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador as traffickers have increasingly infiltrated Central America. Almost all the cocaine consumed in . Western countries is produced in Latin America, while violence linked to . the drug trade kills thousands every year as smugglers fight for . control of trafficking routes in Central America, Colombia and Mexico. Drug . consumption is ticking up in nations such as Argentina and Brazil. According to the OAS, about 45 percent of cocaine consumers, 50 percent . of heroine users and 25 percent of marijuana smokers live in North and . South America. While many people in Central America are also weary of the focus on the drug-fuelled violence, it remains an undeniable part of daily life in many parts of the region. Costa Rica has fared better than many of its neighbors, but it worries about spillover from nearby countries. Honduras, for example, now has the highest homicide rate in the world, with about 7,200 people murdered last year in the tiny nation of 8 million people, most in drug-related crime.

According to the OAS, about 45 percent of cocaine consumers, 50 percent . of heroine users and 25 percent of marijuana smokers live in North and . South America. The . report for the OAS, which includes all 35 North and South American . nations, aims to start a debate among American nations regarding . anti-drug policies. It also advocates for softer policies toward drug . users. 'The . decriminalization of drug consumption must be considered the base of any . public health strategies,' the report says. 'An addict is not a person . with a chronic disease that should be punished for his addiction.' The report echoes comments by Helen . Clark, the head of the U.N. Development Program, who in March said she . favored Latin American governments treating drugs as a public health . problem.

"Fighting talk: Home Secretary Theresa May says she will pass new legislation which will order judges not to bar foreign criminals from being deported under article 8 of the Human Rights Act . Theresa May yesterday went to war with Britain’s judges after it emerged that almost every successful deportation appeal by a foreign criminal is now based on their human right to ‘a family life’. The Home Secretary issued instructions to the courts last July that overseas convicts should normally be booted out regardless of their family circumstances. But immigration judges have been defying her on the grounds that the guidance was not primary legislation so does not carry the same weight as Labour’s Human Rights Act. Mrs May will now pass a new law demanding that Article 8 of the Act – the right to a family life – should no longer be a bar to deportation. The change will not stop criminals lodging lengthy and expensive appeals. But it sends a clear message to judges that the human rights of criminals should not trump those of the public to be kept safe. The danger is that – if refused by the British courts – the offenders will simply take their cases to the unelected European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. The latest figures show almost every foreign criminal who cheated deportation last year did so by claiming a human right to a ‘family life’ in Britain. Last year, an estimated 200 criminals were granted permission to remain in the UK in this way. They add to the stock of 4,000 overseas convicts the Government wants to kick out but is stopped from doing so by human rights legislation. Mrs May said she hoped that once the law is changed the UK courts will get the message. She said: ‘Once this primary legislation has been enacted, it is surely inconceivable that judges in this country will maintain that it is they, rather than Parliament, who are entitled to decide how to balance the foreigner’s right to family life against our nation’s right to protect itself. ‘It is depressing that the steps we have already taken should have been insufficient to produce that result. The inevitable delays inherent in passing primary legislation will mean that there will be many more foreign criminals who successfully avoid deportation on the basis that they have a family here. ‘There will also be more victims of violent crimes committed by foreigners in this country – foreigners who should have been, and could have been, deported.’ Last night Tory MP Dominic Raab said: ‘We need to change the law as a matter of urgency to stem the rampant abuse of the system, protect the public and restore some common sense.’ The plan is to introduce a new Immigration Bill later this year. - Ministers are refusing to release an estimate of the number of migrants likely to come to Britain from Romania and Bulgaria next year when immigration controls are relaxed. The Foreign Office said the National Institute for Economic and Social Research had carried out a study, but it was still being prepared for possible publication some time in the future. A Nigerian who returned to Britain after being deported has been jailed for his role in a £2.7million lottery scam. Osas Odia, 33, was kicked out in 2005 . for using a forged stamp in his passport that allowed him to work. The . management graduate was allowed to return on a marriage visa after . marrying a British nurse. He joined a group of Nigerian fraudsters . who sent thousands of letters to people across the world telling them . they had won millions in a lottery but would have to send money to . ‘unlock’ their windfall. Osas Odia: Returned to the UK on a marriage visa after marrying a British nurseA woman in Bristol who believed she had won £1.8million on the Australian lottery lost £312,000. In Los Angeles a woman who wired £264,000 to the fraudsters was shot dead by her husband when the lottery win never arrived. He then shot himself.Thirteen victims lost an average of £207,000. Odia’s role in the conspiracy was to launder some of the money through three bank accounts in his name. He pleaded guilty at Croydon Crown Court to conspiring to launder criminal property and was jailed for two years on Friday.It is understood that Odia, of Erith, South London, will be allowed to stay in Britain when he is released because of his marital status. Analysis by James Slack . Theresa May is trying to combat the problems caused by Labour's Human Rights Act . Theresa May is attempting to unpick the mess caused by two pieces of Labour legislation: the Human Rights Act and the Borders Act 2007. Before the Human Rights Act (HRA), there was not a single UK case of deportation of a foreign criminal blocked under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, the right to a family life. The HRA enshrined Article 8 into British law for the first time. And once the courts were instructed to start considering if a convict had a wife or children living here, the number of adverse rulings exploded. In 2007, ministers tried to fix this problem with the Borders Act, which stated that anyone sentenced to 12 months or more should normally be kicked out. However, the legislation then fatally undermined itself by saying this requirement should be subject to the HRA, including Article 8. Judges continued to balance the right of a convict to stay with their family against their crimes – and routinely found in their favour. Which brings us to 2011, and the Tory party conference. Mrs May announced she wanted to end the abuse of HRA law but, amid Coalition tensions, opted not to do so by passing a new Act of Parliament. Instead, she issued guidance to the courts saying that, in all bar exceptional circumstances, a foreign criminal should be removed. To an extent, it worked – with the number of successful Article 8 appeals being reduced from around 400 a year to an estimated 200. However, some judges continued to flout the Home Secretary’s wishes. In particular, they pointed out that her guidance to judges did not carry the same force of law as a piece of  primary Parliamentary legislation. Mrs May’s hope is that, by now passing an Act of Parliament, the judges will get the message once and for all that no foreign criminal should be spared on Article 8 grounds. It will not stop foreign criminals from appealing. But a judge would have to explicitly rule against the wishes of Parliament. The danger for the Government is that somebody will take a test case all the way to the Supreme Court, which will find the new law incompatible with the HRA. In this instance, the final say over whether to maintain Mrs May’s new rules would technically rest with Parliament. However, in similar cases in the past – namely detaining terror suspects without trial – ministers have crumbled, and agreed to change the law. It’s also true that, while Britain remains under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights, there is nothing to stop convicts dragging their appeals all the way to Strasbourg.","Home Secretary will pass a new law demanding Article 8 of the Human Rights Act should no longer be a bar to deportation .

"Perhaps it is no coincidence that Macy's - America's first  modern department store and at one point the world's largest - was also the first known retailer in U.S. history to employ a female executive. Margaret Getchell, then 22, joined Macy's in 1861 as a clerk, when it still was a struggling New York City store selling ribbons and lace, but quickly impressed its founder Rowland Hussey Macy with her innovative approach to sales. Four years later, the Massachusetts-born employee was promoted to 'superintendent', an executive-level position, and under her stewardship, Macy's tripled in size. It went from scraping in just $11.06 in sales on its first day, to $1million in annual sales in 1869, and was by then a fully-fledged department store. Scroll down for video . Made history: Margaret Getchell (left) joined Macy's aged 22 when it was still a struggling fabric shop (right) but after climbing the ranks, she was made an executive and helped  triple its size by 1869 . According to Facts On File, it was Ms Getchell's idea to branch out from selling fabrics and start selling clothing, toiletries, hats and jewelry; and eventually groceries, toys and household goods. She was well-known for her legendary window displays and her pioneering marketing ideas. One of Ms Gretchell's most successful moves was to persuade Mr Macy to install a soda fountain for thirsty customers, buried behind rows and rows of distracting merchandise. Similar tactics are employed today by every department store in the world. Another stunt involved dressing up two cats in doll's clothing and plonking them in baby cribs as part of a window display, which predictably pulled in a huge crowd. Ms Getchell's motto was famously: 'Be everywhere, do everything, and never fail to astonish the customer.' The story of her record-breaking success began in her home town of Nantucket, Massachusetts, after she quit her job as a schoolteacher to pursue a life in The Big Apple aged 22. Ms Getchell, who lost her eye in a childhood accident and so had one glass replacement, was a distant cousin of Mr Macy's, which is how she got her entry-level clerk position. She was said to be excellent with numbers, 'pretty' and extremely hard-working, often staying up into the night to strategize with Mr Macy. Before long, she was promoted to bookkeeper. According to writer and historian Sean Braswell, an editor at Ozy, Ms Getchell bombarded her boss and cousin relentlessly with new ideas to grow the business, a tactic she liked to call 'putting a bug in his ear.' Pioneer: Rowland Hussey Macy (pictured), who founded Macy's in 1858, was responsible for hiring Ms Getchell, the first female executive of a U.S. retailer, and credited her with being a 'large' part of his store's success . Historian Ralph M. Hower wrote a book about the store's background, titled History of Macy's of New York, 1858-1919, and in it claims that Mr Macy attributed 'a large part' of his business' success to Ms Getchell. 'While it was not at all unusual at this time to employ women in retail stores, to give one of them an executive position of such importance seems to have marked a radical departure from normal practice,' Mr Hower wrote. In 1869, when she 30, Ms Getchell married Abiel La Forge, a friend of Mr Macy's son, who then became a buyer for the store and later a partner. In an undated letter to his sister, Mr La Forge wrote of his wife: 'She is the Superintendent, having full charge of the entire business. 'As we sell a million dollars-worth of goods a year and have nearly two hundred employees, her position is a very responsible one.' In an all-too-familiar twist at the time, Ms Getchell was asked to give up her salary after her husband was made a partner. As it was: Macy's flagship store in Herald Square, pictured in 1931, when it became the world’s largest store with more than one million square feet of retail space . Today: The current CEO of Macy's (pictured), which last year pulled in $27.2billion in revenue, is Terry J. Lundren. Of its 11 current executive leaders, three are women . The couple went on to have six children, and although Ms Getchell gave up her full-time position at Macy's, she often returned to assist with busy periods. Mr Macy died of kidney disease in 1877 at the age of 54, Mr La Forge died of tuberculosis a year later, and Ms Getchell died of heart failure in 1880, at the age of 38. Macy's now operates 850 department stores in the U.S., Hawaii and Puerto Rico, and pulled in $27.7billion in revenue last year. Its current CEO is 62-year-old Terry J. Lundren. Of its 11 current executive leaders, three are women. As Mr Braswell points out, it has been 134 years since Ms Getchell's death, and female executives in the retail world are still woefully scant. He writes: 'With women still controlling the purse strings when it comes to most household purchasing decisions, and the retail industry still struggling post-recession, most of these companies could benefit from smart women like Margaret Getchell putting a bug in their ears.'","Margaret Getchell, then 22, quit her job as a schoolteacher to join Macy's as a clerk in 1861 when it was still a small struggling fabric store .

"It's the dilemma faced by jetsetting shoppers the world over – buying too many goodies to fit in your suitcase on the way home. Do you shell out for yet another ‘emergency’ suitcase, to add to the piles of unwanted luggage cluttering up your home? Or spend a small fortune shipping your things back? Now an inventor claims to have come up with a better solution, and it’s one that really could take off – an inflatable suitcase. The Fugu suitcase pictured can triple in size using an electric pump that plugs straight into the mains . When it is expanded, the wheeled suitcase can store 120 litres worth of clothes and will cost £190 . It was inspired, he says, by Mary Poppins’s magical bag which famously had room for everything including a lampshade. The new case has side walls similar to an accordion, allowing it to expand in height by an extra 17 inches (45cm), tripling its volume from 40 litres to 120 litres. The walls of the suitcase can be inflated in around 20 seconds using an electronic pump, plugged into a mains supply. Best of all, it allows holidaymakers to save time and money by starting their journey using a compact carry-on size, which is compatible with airlines’ hand luggage size restrictions, according to one of its makers Daniel Gindis. Once inflated for the journey home, the case – named the Fugu after a Japanese pufferfish – can simply be checked it in as hold baggage. It is expected to cost about £190 when it goes on sale. Isaac Atlas, industrial designer at Fugu, got the idea for the case when he had to buy new luggage on his way home from a trip because his carry-on bag could not fit in all his extra shopping. The inflated suitcase, which is now in the prototype stage, can also be used as a surface on which you could stand a laptop or make-up mirror, and has the option of internal shelves to transform it into a cupboard. Its four multi-directional 360 degree wheels make it easy to manoeuvre around the airport, while the fabric of the sides is impact resistant PVC material found in inflatable boats. This means the case should withstand being tossed around the baggage hold. Its makers aim to incorporate other features, such as a refrigerated compartment to protect perishable items and a light which comes on when you open the suitcase in the dark. The company is raising funding through Kickstarter, an online crowd-funding website. Mr Gindis is hoping the suitcase will be available to order by December next year.","The Fugu suitcase can expand from 40 litres to a staggering 120 litres .

"Chilling surveillance footage captures the moment an army veteran ambushes an Oklahoma office worker holding him hostage at gunpoint as he goes on a search for more hostages in an Oklahoma office building earlier this month. Joe Steadman was walking back from his lunch break in Norman, Oklahoma shortly before 12.30pm when an armed Devin Rogers, 29, wearing a backpack and combat boots, grabbed him in a parking lot and shoved a gun to his neck, KOTV reports. 'I asked him, ‘Do you want money? What are your demands?’ and all he said was ‘more people’ in just the evilest, creepiest voice you can imagine,' Steadman told KOTV. Scroll down for video . Footage: Recently released surveillance footage shows army veteran, Devin Rogers, 29, (above) as he takes an officer worker hostage at gunpoint while he searches for more hostages in an Oklahoma office building . In the video, Rogers is seen marching Steadman toward the three-story Nextep office building. Police say that Rogers forced Steadman to open the door to the building using his Key Card access. Once inside, Steadman told the secretary, seen in the surveillance video sitting behind a desk in the office's lobby, that he was a hostage and told her to call the police, according to New York Daily News. 'I said, ‘I have a young family, please don't kill me,’ and he said, ‘If I wanted you dead, you’d already be dead,' Steadman told KOTV about the Nov. 10 afternoon. The video ends with Rogers forcing Steadman onto the elevator and the two end up on the building's second floor where Steadman works, according toThe Oklahoman. Steadman recalled to the Oklahoman that Rogers kept saying that he needed 'more people' but with it being close to the lunch hour, the office building was nearly empty. On the second floor, Rogers saw three people in the Farzaneh law firm office through a locked, glass door including Jennifer McMinn-Shokat and Daymon Capers,  News 9 reports. Forced: Rogers forced Joe Steadman to use his company key card to gain access to the building and marched him, at gunpoint, past a secretary's desk in the lobby of the office building in Norman, Oklahoma . Elevator: The surveillance footage ends with Rogers forcing Steadman on an elevator, the two reportedly end up on the second floor fo the three-story building and Rogers finds more hostages . Steadman told News 9 that Rogers tried unsuccessfully to shatter the glass door with his gun, and then opened fire on the door as the workers inside scattered. Rogers had to use both of his hands to shoot the gun and this gave Steadman the opportunity to run the 20 feet to his office, call the police, and hide  until SWAT teams showed up and reunited him with his family. CBS news reports that Rogers was in communication with SWAT teams during the standoff and around 1.16pm, a large number of people were evacuated from the building. No one was injured. Steadman described the incident as the 'scariest moment of my life,' however, a woman held hostage by Rogers on the second floor, told the Oklahoman that Rogers was 'very nice.' 'When he first came in there, I was pretty hysterical,' McMinn-shokat said. 'He actually calmed me down and assured me, ‘I’m not going to hurt you.’ McMinn-Shokat said that after the reassurances she began to calm down and 'went into survival mode.' Extremely Courteous: Hostage Jennifer McMinn-Shokat (above) described Rogers as 'extremely courteous' and said she never thought to run or hide from the 6 foot 4 gunman . Facebook: In the Facebook post above, posted just one day after the incident, McMinn-Shokat said Rogers was 'a great gunman as far as gunmen go' She said she never thought to run or hide from the 6 foot 4 gunman, and thought it best to engage the army veteran in conversation as other terrified workers hid in adjacent offices. During their conversation, Rogers reportedly revealed to McMinn-Shokat that he is a California native and had fought in Iraq and Afghanistan. He told her that he was struggling to find work and hadn't been able to get anything better than a minimum wage job. 'He just said he wanted to go to jail,' McMinn-shokat said. 'He felt that he had no more value in society and that he just wanted to go to jail and be in solitary confinement for the rest of his life.' The Daily News reports that Rogers let McMinn-Shokat go free around 4.30pm and surrendered peacefully to authorities, ending the more than four-hour ordeal. McMinn-Shokat described her captor as a gentleman, saying he was 'extremely courteous.' In a Facebook post by the paralegal, she wrote that Rogers was a 'great gunman as far as gunmen go.' And continued saying  he 'was not so much a bad guy as a broken one.' McMinn-Shokat told the Daily News that she forgives her 'broken' captor. Rogers is being held at Cleveland County Jail on multiple felony charges including, kidnapping, assault with a deadly weapon, illegally discharging a weapon, and possessing a weapon while committing a felony.","Devin Rogers, 29, held Joe Steadman hostage at gunpoint and searched an Oklahoma office building for more hostages .

"Worrying: Criticism of the state pension in Britain has come at a time when the age of qualification is likely to rise along with the life expectancy of citizens . State pensions in Britain are the worst in any major European economy, a report has revealed. Even former Eastern bloc nations such as Slovenia, Hungary and Slovakia are among those where provision is more generous as a proportion of average incomes, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. A total of 12.3million people in Britain have reached the State pension age – between 61 and 68 – and are entitled to a maximum payout of £110.15. The National Pensioners Convention, which will lobby MPs today for a better deal, says a decent ‘living State pension’ would be £178 a week. The OECD also said yesterday that babies born in Britain this year will ‘probably’ be 70 before they can claim a state pension. At present, a man can start claiming his State pension from the age of 65 and a woman can start to claim her pension from the age of 61 and nine months. Both State pension ages are being increased. By 2018, it will be 65 for women as well as men, and will then keep on rising for them both to 66 in 2020, 67 by 2028 and will keep on going up. Stefano Scarpetta, a director of the OECD, pointed out that many babies born this year will also live to celebrate their 100th birthday which means their retirement will last for least 30 years. A baby girl born this year has a one in 2.5 chance of living to 100, while a baby boy has just under a one in three chance, according to the Department for Work and Pensions. If the State pension age was not increased, it would raise the prospect of a cripplingly expensive State pension system in which people retired at 65 but survived for several more decades. Overall, the OECD’s research, published yesterday, looks at the ‘replacement rate’ - that is the percentage of their final salary that is ‘replaced’ by their State pension. In Britain, it is typically only 32.6 per cent for an average earner, compared with an average across the OECD’s 34 countries of 40.6 per cent. The OECD's research looks at the 'replacement rate' - the percentage of an earner's final salary replaced by their State pension . Pressure: The National Pensioners Convention, which will lobby MPs today for a better deal, says a decent 'living State pension' would be £178 a week, almost £70 short of the current maximum weekly payment . It is far higher in other countries than it is in this country. For example, it is 42 per cent in Germany, 58.8 per cent in France, 45.7 per cent in Norway and as high as 76.6 per cent in Austria. In the Slovak Republic the figure is 67.9 per cent, in Hungary 73.6 per cent and in Slovenia 40.6 per cent - all higher than in the UK. Mr Scarpetta raised his concerns about the future facing young people as Governments put pressure on people to save for themselves, rather than rely on the State to fund their retirement. He said: ‘I am very concerned that we are moving towards a more contribution-based system but in many countries especially young people have been unemployed. ‘They are outside the labour market so they are not contributing (into a pension). ‘We hope the economy will kick on and then many of them will indeed get into a job and so on and so forth. Repost: Steve Webb, the Pensions Minister, above, defended the changes to the pensions system, saying: 'We are building a UK pension system that is more sustainable for the future' ‘But they will have fewer years of . contribution so potentially there is also a long-term effect of the . current crisis which in some countries has been particularly severe, . especially for the young generation.’ Nearly one million people in Britain . between the age of 16 and 24 are currently unemployed, according to . official figures from the Office for National Statistics. Young people aged 22 and over are currently being signed up to a pension scheme by their boss if they earn more than £9,440. But they must, obviously, have a job in order to qualify. Under the standard OECD economic assumptions, full career workers would expect a significant increase in their replacement rates, assuming a contribution level of eight per cent of their income. Average earners are estimated to reach a 55.4 per cent replacement rate, with low earners at 76.2 per cent and high earners at 48.4 per cent, bringing the UK much closer to the OECD average. Dot Gibson, general secretary of the National Pensioners’ Convention, highlighted the nightmare facing today’s pensioners surviving on such a paltry pension payout. The OECD looked at the future facing young people joining the labour market today, working hard and examined the sort of pension that they can expect to receive. She said: ‘Older people are facing a daily struggle with rising costs of living, inadequate pensions and cuts to services they need such as day care centres, social care and bus services. ‘The UK economy can still afford to give all older people certain basic rights in retirement such as a living state pension, dignified care and an end to loneliness and fuel poverty.’ Steve Webb, the Pensions Minister, said: ‘We are building a UK pension system that is more sustainable for the future. ‘As the OECD recognises, by combining the state pension and income from workplace pensions people many people in Britain can expect an adequate retirement income.’","Pensioners in the UK are entitled to a maximum of £110.15 per-week .

Hope Roger Goodell gets fired!' 'I therefore vacate the second penalty imposed on Rice. The provisions of the first discipline - those regarding making continued use of counseling and other professional services, having no further involvement with law enforcement, and not committing any additional violations of league policies - still stand.' Earlier this month, Palmer - now Janay Rice - spoke to ESPN about the Atlantic City incident, saying it stemmed from an 'insignificant' argument between her and her husband. She told the broadcaster: 'As we were arguing, he was on his phone and not looking at me. I went to reach for his phone, and when he grabbed it back, he spit at me and I slapped him. 'We got into the elevator and what happened inside is still foggy to me. The only thing I know - and I can't even say I ""remember"" because I only know from what Ray has told me - is that I slapped him again and then he hit me. I remember nothing else from inside the elevator.' After coming round in the casino lobby, surrounded by police, Palmer was taken to the police station with her husband, who kept telling her 'It's going to be okay. We'll be okay'. Explaining her decision for standing by Rice, she said although she was 'angry', she 'knew it wasn't him' and he had never acted like that before. 'No matter how long we have known each other and no matter what the circumstance is, Ray understands that violent behavior like this, even one time, is never acceptable,' she said. Another disgraced footballer: In September, Minnesota Vikings' star running back Adrian Peterson (pictured) was arrested for disciplining his four-year-old son by striking him with a wooden switch . Rice is not the only NFL player to have sparked anger among fans due to alleged violence. In September, Minnesota Vikings' star running back Adrian Peterson was arrested for disciplining his four-year-old son by striking him with a wooden switch. Peterson pleaded no contest in a Texas courtroom to a misdemeanor assault charge following his arrest and was told to pay a $4,000 (£2,550) fine and undertake community service.

"Astronomers claim Jupiter and its moons could provide the best hope of finding signs of alien life in our solar system. Now, in an effort to explorer its distant oceans, the Jupiter icy moons explorer (Juice) mission has been given the green light to launch in 2022. The five-tonne satellite will reach Jupiter in 2030 where it will use its suite of instruments to explore the planet's atmosphere, magnetosphere and tenuous set of rings. Scroll down for video . Astronomers claim Jupiter and its moons could provide the best hope of finding signs of alien life in our solar system. Now, in an effort to explorer its distant oceans, the Jupiter icy moons explorer (Juice) mission has been given the green light to launch in 2022 (artist's impression pictured) Juice will also look at Jupiter's diverse Galilean moons - volcanic Io, icy Europa and rock-ice Ganymede and Callisto - which make the Jovian system a miniature solar system in its own right. The focus will largely be on Ganymede, though, and will the first time any icy moon has been orbited by a spacecraft. Earlier this year, scientists said Ganymede might have ice and oceans stacked up in several layers similar to a club sandwich. Previously, the moon was thought to harbour a thick ocean sandwiched between just two layers of ice, one on top and one on bottom, but now it seems it has multiple layers. Scientists claims that places where water and rock interact are important for the development of life. For example, it is possible life began on Earth in bubbling vents on our sea floor. Prior to the new study, Ganymede's rocky sea bottom was thought to be coated with ice, not liquid - a problem for the emergence of life. It will visit Callisto, the most heavily cratered object in the solar system, and will twice fly by Europa. Juice is hoping to make the first measurements of the thickness of Europa's icy crust and will identify candidate sites for future in situ exploration. The Galileo mission found strong evidence that a subsurface ocean of salty water is in contact with a rocky seafloor. Scientists claim Ganymede might have ice and oceans stacked up in several layers like a club sandwich . It may seem strange that salt can make the ocean denser, but you can see for yourself how this works by adding table salt to a glass of water. Rather than increasing in volume, the liquid shrinks and becomes denser. This is because the salt ions attract water molecules. The models get more complicated when the different forms of ice are taken into account. The ice that floats in your drinks is called 'Ice I.' It's the least dense form of ice and lighter than water. But at high pressures, like those in crushingly deep oceans like Ganymede's, the ice crystal structures become more compact. 'It's like finding a better arrangement of shoes in your luggage - the ice molecules become packed together more tightly,' said Vance. The ice can become so dense that it is heavier than water and falls to the bottom of the sea. The densest and heaviest ice thought to persist in Ganymede is called 'Ice VI.' By modeling these processes using computers, the team came up with an ocean sandwiched between up to three ice layers, in addition to the rocky seafloor. Europa may be one of our best hopes for finding life in the solar system. Pictured is the surface of Europa . Scientists believe the cycling of material between the ocean and ice shell could potentially provide sources of chemical energy that could sustain simple life forms. It is believed that geysers spurting out of Jupiter's moon may be an opportunity to spot alien life originating beneath the surface. This was based on observations by the Hubble Space Telescope in December 2013 that saw water vapour being ejected from the moon, lending evidence to the existence of jets. 'Jupiter is the archetype for the giant planets of the Solar System and for many giant planets being found around other stars,' Professor Alvaro Giménez Cañete, Esa's Director of Science and Robotic Exploration, said when the mission was announced. 'Juice will give us better insight into how gas giants and their orbiting worlds form, and their potential for hosting life.' Juice is hoping to make the first measurements of the thickness of Europa's icy crust and will identify candidate sites for future in situ exploration .","Jupiter and its moons could be best hope of finding signs of alien life .

"Killer: Steven Hayes, who is on death row, boasted that he had killed 17 people and taken their sneakers as trophies . A Connecticut man convicted of killing a mother and her two daughters in a deadly home invasion bragged about how he killed 17 others and raped dozens of women in leaked letters revealed today. Steven Hayes described in chilling detail how in two of the attacks he had tied up, tortured and killed women – and even made a 16-hour video of him murdering one of his victims. The 48-year-old serial killer, who is on death row for his role in the 2007 home invasion, boasted to a female companion about how he had collected the sneakers of all of his victims as trophies, but said 'the 17 kill trophies' meant the most to him. Hayes was last year convicted of . raping and strangling Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, before tying her . daughters, Hayley, 17 and Michaela, 11, to their beds and setting the . house on fire. He is currently appealing the conviction. Earlier this month, his accomplice was . Joshua Komisarjevsky, was also convicted for his role in the killings . and is due to be sentenced on Tuesday. In the four letters, which were . written in August and September, Hayes wrote that he would have killed . Komisarjevsky if he had not been jailed because while he had the same . 'capacity for evil', he was not committed enough. Hayes told a female in North Carolina, . only identified as 'Lynn', that he wanted to share his 'dark secret' as . 'someone else really should know the truth about' him. Happy family: A June 2007 photo shows Dr William Petit with his daughters Michaela, front, Hayley, centre rear, and his wife, Jennifer Hawke-Petit . 'Yes, I've killed before,' Hayes wrote in the letters which were obtained by the New Haven Register. 'I have 17 kills throughout the Northeast United States. Perfect victims and well executed, controlled endeavors.' In the 17 pages of handwritten . letters, which were confiscated by prison authorities, Hayes gleefully . recounted the rape and murder of his first victim in 1982 and his . eighth. He wrote that all of his victims were aged between 14 and 25. The New Haven Register, which has not . detailed how it acquired the letters, reported that the letters read . 'like a twisted pornographic fantasy'. Hayes wrote that he spotted his first . victim, a girl who was hitchhiking, as he was driving home from a bar. He described her as 'short, hot and the perfect victim'. Last images: CCTV from a bank shows Jennifer Hawke-Petit attempting to plead with the clerk after she had been sent in by her assailants to withdraw $15,000 . Accomplice: Joshua, Komisarjevsky is due to be sentenced on Tuesday . 'Like any great hunter, timing is critical,' he wrote about how he chose his victims. Hayes told how he picked up the girl . and drove her to a secluded location where he tied her up and threw her . in the trunk before taking her to a cheap motel, which he said became . his 'location of choice' for his attacks. According to the newspaper, he . described in detail how he sexually assaulted the woman and then pinched . her nose and suffocated her. 'A monster was born,' he wrote. 'This carried on with my top 17 sexual . conquests and kills,' he wrote according to the Register. 'The . trophies, the signature kill, the thrill of the hunt and the disposal of . my adventure buddies.' Hayes said that he picked up his . eighth victim, who he found drunk walking along a road, and told her he . would take her back to his house to smoke crack cocaine and drink beer. He claimed that he tied her to his bed for an entire weekend and tortured her before killing her. 'The more pain and emotional abuse she went through, the better I liked it,' he said. 'And believe me, I was in heaven.' Hayes claimed that he recorded the . assault and killing on a 16-hour video, which he described as 'by far . the best snuff film ever created'. He said that he kept hold of the tape for six months before it 'found a home' in Portland, Oregon. Horror: An image shown to the court shows the charred bedroom of Hayley Petit after the attack . Komisarjevsky, who could also face the . death penalty for his part in the attacks, was described as being a . disappointment to Hayes in the letters. 'I've searched my whole life for . someone who could embrace and had the capacity for evil as I possess,' Hayes wrote, according to the Register. 'I thought I finally found it in . Josh.' 'But events show Josh, while [he] had . the proper evil intent, lacked in the most serious aspects, commitment . and control,' he added. State Attorney Michael Dearington . and an FBI spokesman have declined to say whether Hayes' purported . crimes are being investigated or whether authorities are aware of 17 . unsolved homicides matching details in his letters. Hayes asked the recipient to hold on . to the details of the letters until after his execution because the . information 'could be worth millions to the right people.' Hayes' attorney, Thomas Ullman, declined to comment.","Steven Hayes described two of the attacks in chilling detail, including how he made 16-hour video of him torturing and killing one woman .

"The first gay weddings will be held in Britain next summer after the Queen signed off landmark laws. MPs cheered in the Commons as it was announced the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill had been given royal assent. Ministers hailed the ‘historic moment’ and Stephen Fry declared 'hurrah, hurray hurroo!’ but Catholic bishops warned it heralded ‘profound social change’. Legal: The Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill has now passed into law, clearing the way for the first gay weddings in summer 2014 . The legislation had proven deeply controversial, with David Cameron accused of pushing it through despite it not being in either the Tory or Lib Dem manifestos in 2010. Dozens of Conservative MPs tried to derail the Bill which only passed the Commons with the support of Labour and Lib Dem votes. However last night it cleared the House of Lords, and today Commons Speaker John Bercow announced it had become law. He told MPs: ‘I have to notify the House in accordance with the Royal Assent 1967 that Her Majesty has signified her Royal Assent to the following acts... Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill.’ Stephen Fry lead the Twitter . tributes, writing: ‘Thanks, Your Majesty, for the Royal Assent. You soon . won't be the only married queen in Britain. Hurrah, hurray hurroo!’ Delight: Broadcaster Stephen Fry used Twitter to thank the Queen for the law change while equalities minister Maria Miller said it was an 'historic moment' MPs last night decided not to oppose a number of minor changes made by the Lords to the Bill. Among the changes agreed were protections for transgender couples which will allow people to change sex and remain married. There will also be a review of whether . belief organisations such as the Humanists will be allowed to carry out . marriages, while ministers said they were prepared to look at . eliminating any difference in the treatment of gay couples when it came . to pension schemes. Vincent Nichols, Archbishop of Westminster, warned the move heralded 'profound social change' Equalities minister Maria Miller said she was looking forward to the first same-sex marriage by next summer. He . said: ‘Marriage is the bedrock of our society and now irrespective of . sexuality everyone in British society can make that commitment. ‘Making marriage available to all couples demonstrates our society's respect for all individuals regardless of their sexuality. 'It demonstrates the importance we attach to being able to live freely. It says so much about the society that we are and the society that we want to live in. ‘The fact that the Bill passed through both Houses undefeated is a huge accomplishment for the Government. ‘This is a historic moment that will resonate in many people's lives. I am proud that we have made it happen, and I look forward to the first same sex wedding by next summer.’ However the Catholic Bishops Conference of England and Wales said that the passing of the Act ‘marks a watershed in English law and heralds a profound social change’. In a statement, conference president the Archbishop of Westminster the Most Rev Vincent Nichols and vice-president the Archbishop of Southwark Peter Smith said: ‘The new Act breaks the existing legal links between the institution of marriage and sexual complementarity. ‘With this new legislation, marriage has now become an institution in which openness to children, and with it the responsibility on fathers and mothers to remain together to care for children born into their family unit, are no longer central. ‘That is why we were opposed to this legislation on principle.’","The Queen gives Royal Assent to the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill .

"The team of researchers who caused uproar when they claimed a variety of genetically modified corn causes cancer has insisted the crop 'cannot be regarded as safe'. Leading scientists lined up to condemn the study after it was published two months ago, saying it lacked scientific rigour and had made a series of basic errors. Russia banned the import of the corn and a group of six French scientific institutions carried out an investigation which accused the study authors of playing on public fears to hype their own reputations. Just too perfect? Two GM corncobs (right) are compared to non-GM corn (left) grown in Germany . But French scientist Dr Gilles-Eric . Séralini and his colleagues have now hit back maintaining the safety . of the NK603 variety of GM corn remains unproven. They accused many of their critics of lacking credibility because of links to the GM industry and said much of the criticism was led by 'plant biologists, some developing patents on GMOs, and from Monsanto Company owning these products'. Refusing to give in to demands to withdraw their study, they said their findings represented 'the most detailed test' of genetically modified crops that are ' independent from the biotech and pesticide companies' which develop them. They said in their rebuttal, published as a letter to the journal Food and Chemical Toxicology, that unlike many other scientists involved in researching GM foods they were free from industry influence because they had no intention of 'commercialising a new product'. It was also pointed out by the team that the research represented a 'first step' rather than a final conclusion about the potential impacts of NK603 corn and that further experiments may be able to establish its safety. For their original study they carried out experiments on rats and concluded that the GM corn, developed by US biotech company Monsanto, increased the risks of breast cancer and liver and kidney damage. Controversial: The introduction of GM foods to our shops has been met with horror by some consumers . Experiments carried out by the team also suggested that tiny quantities of the widely available weedkiller Roundup, also developed by Monsanto, was also associated with an increased risk of cancer. The experiments were carried out over two years whereas, they pointed out, biotech companies have usually based claims that their GM products are safe after feeding new varieties to rats for 90 days. After publication of the study, in the peer reviewed Food and Chemical Toxicology, a dozen senior scientists signed a letter to the journal saying it should never have been published. GM food and feed is strictly regulated within the EU. Labels must indicate to consumers when GM ingredients are included in food . All products that are GM or include GM ingredients must meet traceability rules so that all retailers are able to identify their suppliers. Risk assessments for all new GM products are carried out by the European Food Safety Authority before they can be sold in Europe . 'This study does not provide sound evidence to support its claims. Indeed, the flaws in the study are so obvious that the paper should never have passed review,' they wrote. 'This appears to be a case of blatant misrepresentation and misinterpretation of data to advance an anti-GMO agenda by an investigator with a clear vested interest.' The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) ordered a French University to carry out a review of the research while in Russia the Institute of Nutrition was asked to conduct a similar exercise. Monsanto said in a statement in September: 'Based on our initial review, we do not believe the study presents information that would justify any change in EFSA’s views on the safety of genetically modified corn products or alter their approval status for genetically modified imports.' Read the rebuttal by Dr Séraliniand and his colleagues.","Study found rats eating GM corn NK603 suffered higher risk of tumours .

"The man who was shot dead by a police officer after opening fire at city's police headquarters and the Mexican Consulate has been identified as Larry Steven McQuilliams.

The man who was shot dead by a police officer after opening fire at city's police headquarters and the Mexican Consulate has been identified as Larry Steven McQuilliams . According to McQuilliams' Facebook page, he was an avid participant in Renaissance fair culture, posting several photos of himself in full costume . Assistant Chief Raul Munguia says nobody else was hurt. Authorities received multiple 911 calls between 2.22am and 2.32am about shots fired at buildings downtown. Munguia said bullets struck police headquarters along 8th Street and the Interstate 35 frontage road, a Mexican Consulate and a federal courthouse. Pre-dawn shooting: A gunman opened fire on three buildings in downtown Austin overnight . Investigators record the scene where the shooting took place . Doors filled with broken glass are photographed after authorities shot and killed a man who they say opened fire on the Mexican Consulate .

This image shows what appears to be cops dragging the man's body away from his van . Threat: Police called in a bomb squad after spotting suspicious devices inside the white van . Tragedy thwarted: All the targeted buildings were closed overnight and no one was injured . During a press conference at 10am Eastern time, Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo described the shooter as a white male, about 50 years of age, from Austin, Texas. Heroic: Sgt Adam Johnson, a 15-year veteran of the department, has been identified as the cop who shot the suspect . He revealed that the officer who shot the suspect, 15-year veteran Sgt Adam Johnson, was outside with a pair of police horses from the Mounted Patrol when he spotted the armed man, who was wearing 'some type of vest' resembling a suicide vest often used by terrorists. According to Chief Acevedo, the sergeant fired a single shot at the suspect with one hand while holding the horses by the reins with the other. However, police are not sure at this time whether it was the cop's bullet that ended the suspect's life, or whether he committed suicide. No was else was hurt in the incident. 'Police are the last line of defense against homegrown threats,' the police chief stated, adding that the attack may have been over US immigration policy. 'When you look at the national debate right now about immigration, that ... comes to mind. Sometimes our political discourse becomes very heated and sometimes very angry,' Acevedo told reporters. President Barack Obama this month imposed the most sweeping immigration changes in a generation, easing the threat of deportation for some 4.7million illegal immigrants. The suspect's white van was parked in an area near police headquarters, the Mexican Consulate and a federal courthouse. Responding officers dragged the mortally wounded man from his car, but backed away and called the bomb squad after noticing the vest on him and suspicious-looking cylinders inside the van. KEYE-TV later reported that the metal cylinders were propane tanks the suspect had used to start a small fire at the Mexican Consulate, which was quickly extinguished. In a statement, the Mexican Foreign Ministry expressed its 'deep concern and condemnation of the incident.' Active scene: Police tape marks off the scene after authorities shot and killed a man who they say opened fire on the Mexican Consulate, police headquarters and other downtown buildings early Friday . Evidence: Propane tanks the suspect had used to start a fire at the consulate are seen scattered on the ground at the crime scene . Update: Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo gives a press conference on the shooting Friday morning . Acevedo said during the press conference that it was determined this morning that the gunman did not have any explosives on his person or in his vehicle. Eyewitness Jesse Van Wallene told NBC News he was about 15 feet away from the suspect when he stopped at a red light and saw a large gun in his hands. Wallene described the suspect as wearing a bullet-proof vest and a helmet with a clear visor. None of the tactical gear had any markers on it, which convinced the witness that the man in front of him was not a member of law enforcement. Moments later, Wallene said the gunman opened fired on a building opposite the police HQ. 'He was firing in bursts of about five shots,' the 29-year-old waiter said. 'He didn't even seem to acknowledge we were there, he just seemed very focused on firing at the building, which had no lights on inside.' A robot was used to remove the objects from the vehicle, which police suspect may have been IEDs . Emergency: The shooting led to the evacuation of the police HQ in the Texas capital and the closure of several roads in the downtown section of the city . Shutdown: Police closed I-35 for hours in both directions after the shooting . Chief Art Acevedo revealed during the Friday morning news conference that the slain perpetrator had a criminal record, but he would not elaborate on it.

"As Luis Suarez’s first goal went in on Tuesday night, Manuel Pellegrini sank back in his seat. It was hard to tell whether the look was one of exasperation or resignation. Pellegrini had a year to prepare for this, a year to solve the problems that characterised his team’s defeat against Barcelona last season. It took just a quarter of an hour for him to realise he hadn’t managed it. For all that Manchester City found a way back into this game in the second half, the decisive period was the opening half-hour. It told us that City continue to chase their tails when it comes to finding the right template in the Champions League. Brazilian midfielder brings down Luis Suarez having struggled to control the middle of the park on Tuesday . Manchester City's players are stunned after Barcelona put in a magnificent first-half performance . James Milner (right) had a tough task in the centre of midfield as Barcelona prevailed 2-1 at the Etihad . They grabbed something from this game by chasing it hard. Their energy and will found them a way and Joe Hart’s penalty save at the death means that the Barclays Premier League champions head to Spain next month in better spirits than they might have mustered. The truth is, however, that teams do not make significant headway in this tournament by chasing games, especially at home. Dominance comes from solid possession. It comes from control and method. City continue to invest in their squad but nights like this raise valid questions about whether the team is actually moving forward. If this seems unkind given the stellar nature of the opposition, so be it. This is the company City have made it their stated intention to keep. Nobody expects them to dominate the ball against Luis Enrique’s extraordinarily gifted team. The one way to make sure you fail against Barcelona is by trying to copy them. Former Liverpool striker Luis Suarez whips in his first-goal for the visitors after just 16 minutes . Suarez runs away with his trademark celebration having given the La Liga giants the lead in the first-half . Nevertheless, City must realise they simply must do better. They must find a way to dictate passages of play against the best opposition, if not the whole game. There remains a lack of authority to their play in Europe. It is not just Barcelona who have come to the Etihad Stadium and messed the home team around for periods. Bayern Munich have done it. AS Roma have done it. Even Napoli and CSKA Moscow have done it. One senses that Pellegrini and football director Txiki Begiristain know exactly what the problem is. It goes right to the heart of the team — to the centre of the City midfield. This is where foundations for victories at this level are built. This is where momentum builds. It comes from possession, from the rhythm of simply moving the ball. Manchester City keeper Joe Hart (centre) reacts after Barcelona went 2-0 after just 30 minutes . Fernando (centre) grapples with Barcelona's Lionel Messi as he attempts to regain possession . City have invested in the Brazilian duo Fernandinho and Fernando over the last two summers in a bid to construct a platform. Frank Lampard has added something domestically in that area this season. On Tuesday, James Milner began the game there with Fernando. Still, though, City look a million miles short. Certainly they do when compared to players like Barcelona’s Sergio Busquets and, for example, Bayern’s Bastian Schweinsteiger, or even Chelsea’s Nemanja Matic. On Tuesday night, City missed Yaya Toure, of course. The Ivorian was suspended. Even Toure, though, has looked muddled at times in Europe — not knowing whether to go or hold —and that is perhaps why City’s search has led them to the door of the French international midfielder Paul Pogba of Juventus. James Milner (right) struggled to help Manchester City dictate the midfield against Barcelona . The former Manchester United player will not come cheap this summer but City’s interest is real. He is the right age and it is not hard to see where Pogba’s physicality would improve this team. On Tuesday, Fernando and Milner were humbled from the start. The Brazilian had a wretched night. His first contribution was to give the ball straight to Busquets. The subsequent pass almost landed on Lionel Messi’s toe. Some start that would have been. Suarez can't hide his delight having scored his second of the night to put Barcelona 2-0 up on the night . Ten minutes later the City midfielder erred again, passing the ball to Suarez who raced through on goal. During a 30-minute spell during the middle of the opening half, City were second best by a rather distressing distance. Messi was almost impossible to track, sometimes dropping so deep he could almost shake hands with his own central defenders. When he moved, he did so in a manner alien to those in blue. Suarez was similarly difficult to follow and Neymar, operating from a starting position on the left side, timed his forays infield with devastating instinct. A second goal goes in for Barcelona and Joe Hart lets out a roar of frustration in the City goal mouth . Sergio Aguero fired in a delightful strike for City but with two away goals, Barcelona are in command . It was in turn thrilling and demoralising to watch and City really should have been able to come up with a more convincing answer. Everything Barcelona did was straight from the Nou Camp’s most classic playbook. City have invested money and thought in preparing Pellegrini’s squad for nights like this and at times here it was difficult to work out where it had all gone. Certainly City improved in the second half but it was all rather too late. At the end there was a sense of relief that the damage had not been greater. That, however, isn’t what European football is about. It is not about relief or small mercies. It’s about winning, it’s about moving forward. City, undeniably, remain inert.

"A Japanese politician who sparked an international row after claiming the use of sex slaves during WWII was justified has tried to shift the blame by accusing other country's of using the same practice. Osaka Mayor Toru Hashimoto, co-leader of an emerging nationalist party, argued Japan's wartime practice of forcing Asian women into prostitution was necessary to maintain military discipline and provide relaxation for soldiers. But following the public outcry over his comments, the mayor has attempted to deflect criticism by accusing America and Britain of using sex slaves for its own soldiers.

He said: 'It is a hard truth that even these nations used local women for sexual reasons. This is a historical fact and there is hard evidence that proves it was true.' Historians say up to 200,000 women, . mainly from the Korean Peninsula and China, were forced to provide sex . for Japanese soldiers in military brothels. While some other World War . II armies had military brothels, Japan is the only country accused of . such widespread, organized sexual slavery.

Hashimoto has since claimed he had not tried to . condone a system of so-called comfort women, but meant to say military . authorities at the time, not only in Japan but in many other countries, . considered it necessary. 'Comfort woman' is a translation of . the Japanese euphemism, jugun ianfu, (military comfort women), referring . to women of various ethnic and national backgrounds and social . circumstances who became sex slaves for the Japanese troops before and . during World War Two. Forgotten women: Hashimoto failed to mention the Chinese, Filipino, and Indonesian women also exploited as sex slaves during World War II. Above, Filipino former-comfort women march in 2004 to protest their wartime abuse . Outraged: Former 'comfort woman' Lee Yong-Soo (left) stands beside her supporters holding portraits of Chinese, Philippine, South Korean and Taiwanese comfort women who were sex slaves . Hashimoto also claims singling out Japan is wrong, alleging the issue also existed in the armed forces of the United States, . Britain, France, Germany and the former Soviet Union during World War . II. 'Based on the premise that Japan must . remorsefully face its past offenses and must never justify the offenses, . I intended to argue that other nations in the world must not attempt to . conclude the matter by blaming only Japan and by associating Japan . alone with the simple phrase of ""sex slaves"" or ""sex slavery"",' Hashimoto said in a statement to journalists. But the mayor did apologise to for saying U.S. troops should patronize adult entertainment businesses as a way to reduce sex crimes. Hashimoto's suggestion to the U.S. troops brought sharp criticism from Washington. The State Department . called Hashimoto's comments 'outrageous and offensive. Painful past: A South Korean woman cries during a protest rally at the Japanese embassy in Seoul, where demonstrators demanded compensation and punishment for soldiers who abused women . Sense of crisis: Hashimoto made the comments because of a 'sense of crisis' over sex crimes committed by U.S. soldiers stationed in Okinawa, where there has been a U.S. military presence ever since World War II . Okinawa . was invaded by U.S. forces in World War II and has had an American . military presence since. The 1995 rape of a schoolgirl by two Marines . and a sailor spread rage across the island, and more rapes and other . crimes linked to U.S. servicemen over the years, along with military . land use and aircraft noise, have caused longstanding anti-U.S. military . sentiment there. Hashimoto said his remarks rose from a 'sense of crisis' about the cases of sexual assaults by U.S. military personnel on Japanese civilians in Okinawa, where a large number of U.S. troops are based under a bilateral security treaty. 'I understand that my remark could be . construed as an insult to the U.S. forces and to the American people' and was inappropriate, he told a news conference at the Foreign . Correspondents' Club of Japan in Tokyo. 'I retract this remark and . express an apology.' 'Comfort woman' is a translation of . the Japanese euphemism, jugun ianfu, (military comfort women), referring . to women of various ethnic and national backgrounds and social . circumstances who became sex slaves for the Japanese troops before and . during World War Two. Military brothels existed across the Asia Pacific region in areas occupied by the Japanese forces. There . is no way to determine precisely how many women were forced to serve as . comfort women, but estimates range from 80,000 to 200,000, of whom . about 80 per cent of whom are thought to have been Korean. Some of the girls forced into sexual slavery were as young as 12 years old, according to Chinese legal groups. An 'inexcusable act': Historians estimate that the Japanese military forced up to 200,000 women to act as prostitutes during World War II . Japanese . women and women of other occupied territories (such as Taiwan, the . Philippines, Indonesia, Burma and the Pacific islands) were also used as . comfort women, according to a report by San Francisco State University. The authorities believed the comfort . system would enhance the morale of the military and help prevent . soldiers from committing sexual violence toward women of occupied . territories, which became a real concern after the infamous Nanjing . Massacre in 1937. They . were also concerned with the health of the troops, which prompted close . supervision of the hygienic conditions in the comfort stations to help . keep STDs under control. When . the war ended, the only military tribunal concerning the sexual abuse . of comfort women took place in Batavia (now Jakarta, the capital of . Indonesia) in 1948. Several . Japanese military officers were convicted for having forced the 35 . Dutch women involved in the case into comfort stations. The issue began to emerge in Korea only in the late 1980s. The . Japanese government admitted deception, coercion and official . involvement in the recruitment of comfort women in August 1993, but . critics said they needed to go much further. After . Japan's surrender it is reported that it set up a similar system there . for American GIs, with tacit approval from U.S. authorities, . Japanese . officials visited a New Jersey town in April 2012 to ask for a memorial . to the thousands of Korean women and girls who were enslaved to be . removed.","Osaka Mayor Toru Hashimoto argued Japan's wartime practice of forcing Asian women into prostitution was necessary to maintain army discipline .

"London's mayor Boris Johnson is famous for his ability to make people laugh but it would seem that he isn't the only Conservative politician with a ready sense of humour. Home Secretary Theresa May also knows more than a thing or two about raising a smile - a talent she demonstrated for the benefit of a local police officer while waiting for the Queen outside a Berkshire school this morning. According to onlookers, a smiling Mrs May chatted happily to a local policeman before treating him to a series of amusing facial expressions, among them a grimace and an eye-roll, and staring up at the heavens with a smile. The entertainer: The Home Secretary treated a police officer to an amusing series of grimaces as she waited for the Queen to arrive . Sense of humour: Mrs May rolls her eyes towards the heavens - much to the delight of police officers and dignitaries . All smiles: The Home Secretary had stopped joking by the time the Queen arrived and swept her a curtsey instead . When the monarch arrived, Mrs May, who was resplendent in a grey tweed suit and a pair of her favourite leopard print kitten heels, opted for a big smile and a curtsey and put jokes aside as she accompanied the royal couple on a tour of free school, Holyport College. The Queen herself was elegant in a pretty pale pink ensemble, complete with one of her trademark Launer handbags, and was all smiles as she was welcomed to the school by headmaster, Walter Boyle. Joined by the Duke of Edinburgh, the Queen was treated to a tour of the school, including a peep at lessons, the science laboratory and one of the boarding houses. Once inside, the Queen joked about the proliferation of satellite navigation ahead of old fashioned map reading after joining a group of students studying geography. As the children crouched over maps following co-ordinates, the Queen watched intently and chatted to Josh Jacques, aged 11. He explained they had been set the task of finding a point on the map and the Queen joked: 'Nowadays you probably have a sat-nav or something'. Nice to see you: Mrs May also showed off a pair of her trademark leopard print kitten heels and a neatly tailored tweed suit . Much better: Mrs May clearly enjoyed her encounter with the Queen and was left wreathed in smiles after the monarch moved away . Dutiful: The Duke of Edinburgh was on cheerful form but the Queen looked pensive as she prepared to meet Holyport students . Pretty: The Queen was ravishing in a pretty pale pink ensemble and accessorised the outfit with a triple string of pearls . One of the growing number of free schools, Holyport College is an all-ability, co-educational day and boarding school for students aged 11 to 19, which opened this September. Nearby Eton College, which counts the Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry among alumni, is the new institution’s educational sponsor and has helped to shape the school in the years leading up to its opening by taking a leading role on its governing body. Pupils are able to use some of the facilities at the world famous College, particularly for sports activities, and Eton students volunteer at Holyport helping their peers in a range of areas, especially with homework. The annual fees for children boarding at the school, 55 in total, are just over £11,000 a year. During the visit the Duke of Edinburgh, who is known for his quips, could not resist making a joke about an elevator which slowly carried the royal couple to a first floor dormitory beeping as it went. He said to laughter from senior college staff: 'How did you manage to get an antique lift into the building?' The Queen, meanwhile, chatted to a group of boys who told her their bedrooms were just along the corridor and she joked 'no excuses for being late'. Top form: The Duke of Edinburgh and the Queen toured Holyport College, a Berkshire free school sponsored by Eton . Very nice: The Queen was handed a posy made up of pale pink roses and purple lilies as she entered the school . Hero: The Queen was introduced to Britain's Oskar Schindler, Sir Nicholas Winton, 105, as well as children from the school (right) What's up there? The Queen is momentarily distracted while being introduced to a line of Holyport College pupils . Taking a tumble: The Duke of Edinburgh looks impressed as he watches a young gymnast in action . The visit comes hot on the heels of a row about private schools and the state sector, sparked by a column written by Labour's Shadow Education Secretary Tristram Hunt in which he threatened to strip the fee-paying sector of tax breaks worth £700m. Writing in the Guardian, Mr Hunt, who is himself privately educated, said private schools have not done enough to support state establishments and must do more if they wish to keep the tax break. 'The next government will say to them: step up and play your part,' said Mr Hunt. 'Earn your keep. Because the time you could expect something for nothing is over.' The resulting row saw independent schools and Conservative politicians hit back at Mr Hunt, who also opposes free schools, accusing him of fomenting class war and acting in a 'bigoted' manner. Mark Beard, headteacher of Mr Hunt's old school the independent University College School, said Labour should be considering 'new, helpful initiatives' to raise standards in state schools instead of trying to 'tastelessly quantify' the value of public benefit his former school generates each year. In a statement, Mr Beard said: 'If the shadow education secretary were to visit his old school, what would he find? A diverse pupil population from all creeds and backgrounds, with £1 million per annum granted for fee assistance, the vast majority for 100 per cent bursaries. 'Indeed, if Mr Hunt wanted to tastelessly quantify the value of public benefit that UCS generates each year then he would find that it far outstrips the value of tax relief that UCS receives through its charitable status. 'Rather than rely on independent schools to solve the issues for the 93 per cent of children who are educated in the state sector, isn't it time for Labour to come up with some new, helpful initiatives rather than espousing what some might deem an offensive bigotry?' Inspection: The Queen joined pupils for lessons as well as touring the dormitories and refectory . Can I join in? During this geography lesson, the Queen joked about the popularity of sat-nav and the decline of maps . What's in there? The Queen peers through a microscope during a tour of the school's state-of-the-art science labs . Sporty: Pupils studying at Holyport can also use the sporting facilities at Eton, which sponsors the Berkshire free school . Well-wishers: The royal couple were greeted outside the school by a cheering crowd that included this adorable young well-wisher .","Home Secretary Theresa May pulled the faces while waiting for the Queen outside a Berkshire free school .

"The US Navy's brand-new aircraft carrier, scheduled for delivery in 2016 at a cost of over $12 billion, may be less effective than the ships it is designed to replace, it was revealed today. USS Gerald R. Ford is the lead ship in a new class of advanced carriers with an incredible amount of firepower and stuffed with cutting-edge and top secret technology. But an internal review document obtained by the Boston Globe points out a number of performance issues with critical systems on the ship, even including the launch and landing of aircraft. Fanfare: The new $12billion carrier was christened in November 2013, but a new report has shown a number of concerning developmental problems . Worries: The brand-new aircraft carrier, scheduled for delivery in 2016, may be less effective than the ships it is designed to replace . When finished, it is hoped the giant 1,106-foot carrier will be able to launch 220 airstrikes per day from its two runways, hold 4,000 sailors and marines, and be virtually invisible to enemy radar. Yet this report shows the ship, which is currently being tested in a yard in Virginia, has problems in four vital areas. As well as the fundamental issues in launching and landing military jets, there are also concerns about the ship's complex radar system and a weapons elevator. The Boston Globe reports that the document shows that other systems, such as communications, are operating below expected standards. Fit for purpose? An internal review document points out a number of performance issues with critical systems on the ship, even including the launch and landing of aircraft . 'Poor reliability of these critical systems could cause a cascading series of delays during flight operations that would affect [the ship's] ability to generate sorties, make the ship more vulnerable to attack, or create limitations during routine operations,' the report states. The author of the assessment, J. Michael Gilmore, has reportedly concluded that the Navy may have to rethink these important components of the ship. This review was written over a year-long evaluation of the carrier which was completed in September 2013. Experts have stated that development problems are common on the lead ship of a new class carrier and around 40 percent of the Gerald Ford class consists of completely new components. And Rear Admiral Thomas J. Moore told the Globe that he is that these problems can be ironed out in the two years before the ship is due for delivery. 'With these new technologies comes a lot of developmental challenges,' Moore said. 'We expect to wring out the rest of the problems,' he told the paper. 'We have 26 months to go.' Superpower: When finished, it is hoped the giant 1,106-foot carrier will be able to launch 220 airstrikes per day from its two runways, hold 4,000 sailors and marines, and be virtually invisible to enemy radar . But one of the biggest problems is the issue with the launching and landing of jets, specifically designed to increase the number of flights that can be flown from one carrier. The new launching system for planes is powered electromagnetically rather than the steam action of the past and it is designed to launch many planes very quickly. Yet, according to the report, tests have shown that it is reliable at only 240 launches without a failure. At this point in time it should be able to achieve 1,250 . launches without failure. The landing system, which effectively 'catches' aircraft on the deck with a series of cables is only averaging 20 successful landings without . failure. It should be reaching 4,950 successful landings. Time: The Navy is confident that the issues will be resolved for delivery of the carrier. 'We expect to wring out the rest of the problems,' Rear Admiral Thomas J. Moore said. 'We have 26 months to go'","USS Gerald R.

"From riding a jet-pack to work and skiing on top of recycling plants to never having to worry about upgrading your smartphone again, the future is not doom and gloom, according to one renowned environmentalist. Jonathon Porritt is determined to show people that a sustainable and eco-friendly future could be enjoyable and not full of sacrifices to save humanity. As well as technological advances, he believes the UK will be a better place to live if steps to tackle climate change are taken - and we could even be working less. From rising a jet-pack to work and skiing on top of recycling plants (the structure is illustrated) to never having to worry about upgrading your smartphone again, the future is not doom and gloom, Jonathan Porritt said . The World We made is written from the perspective of character Alex McKay, a 50-year-old history teacher working in Ashton Vale school in the year 2050 . 'A more sustainable world is a more enjoyable one that shows the dynamism of human spirit and not a sense of sacrifice,' he told MailOnline. Mr Porritt's latest book, The World We Made, is written from the perspective of character Alex McKay, a 50-year-old history teacher working in Ashton Vale school in the year 2050. It explores his reality, living in the UK 37 years from now, in 50 snapshots ranging from clever building designs and energy solutions, to ways of shaking up the working week and technology that lasts for life. 'People are recognising change is necessary,' said Mr Porritt. 'The trouble is that people don’t think . the world will be better and don’t believe they can have as good a life . as they do today, so they put it [change] off until a bit later,' he added. In his vision of 2050, upgrading to the . latest smartphone handset is a thing of the past as the device is . updated constantly and is designed to last for life. The aircraft of the future? An illustration of BoeingAir's imagined C2050, which in the book is the first commercial hybrid electric plane that runs on a biofuel mix and has super efficient engines . 'What consumers would really love is what . the physical product does. If you could make a smartphone for life and have . just as much aspiration for software as a shiny new handset  - why wouldn’t people be happy . with that?' he asked. Mr Porritt's organisation, Forum for the . Future, is working with Sony to explore whether the habit of . 'upgrading' technology, which sees millions of devices thrown into . landfill, could be consigned to history and whether a 'handset for life' is possible. An illustration of a vertical greenhouse in 2038. More than 30 per cent of food consumed in 2050 is grown in urban environments, such as edible 'green corridors' and vast greenhouses as well as on roofs and allotments . In 2050 everyone will have their genome sequenced and take personalised medicine. More than 132,000 people in the UK will be over 100 years old. The UK will increasingly be a nation of vegetarians as meat consumption drops and half of 'meat' is made in the lab. Less people will suffer from diabetes after numbers peaked in 2030, causing governments to tax sugar, salt and fat in processed food. In 2022 all the leaders of the world's religions and major faith groups will sign a declaration to cut food wastage. Renewable energy will provide the bulk of the UK's power after a flirtation with nuclear power ends in cyber attacks, which causes terror and disruption. By 2050 a unit of electricity generated by solar farms costs no more than electricity from any other source. Upgrading to the latest smartphone handset will be a thing of the past as the device is updated constantly and is designed to last for life. Nearly everything is recycled, repaired or reused thanks to laws and standarised components. Robots will help with domestic tasks and even care for the elderly. In 2050 humans work shorter hours - just under 25 hours a week - in a bid to distribute paid work more fairly. In the book, the protagonist, Alex, writes: 'All the devices I use today are at least 10 years old, quite simply because they still do everything I need them to do ... They're all but indestructible and the software on which they run is updated automatically or on command and works just as eell at home, at work or play on display screens, handheld or retinal, activated by voice, movement and thought.' The vision of 2050 is a world where 'nearly everything is recycled, repaired or reused' as laws have been passed and components standardised to cut waste. While there is a lot of emphasis on less electrical devices, robots feature heavily in Mr Porritt's vision of the future. Alex writes that they are 'as much part of our lives as our pets are, both in the home and the workplace, where remote-controlled telepresence robots became increasingly commonplace from the early 2020s onwards.' In 2050, many families have a domestic robot which has more computer power than the human brain, despite the fact they are very much 'helpers'. 'Robots have simply become as natural an extension of our lives as a car or a fridge and there's no denying the fact that people do get very attached to their robots, Alex writes. 'As the ""companionability"" of very . cheap standard robots has increased, it's become more and more natural . to think of them as ""friends"" of a sort - but somehow not as people.' The . robots are used to care for elderly people and to provide healthcare as . well as to control artificial limbs by brain signals alone. In the vision of the UK in 2050 humans are doing less work - and not just because of robots. In the fictional future, the EU's . 'Maximum Working Time Directive' is introduced and in 2045 . people work for just under 25 hours a week in their regular job, . compared to an average of 36.4 hours in 2010. The book's protagonist is a teacher at 'Ashton Vale School' in 2050. This is an image of the classroom, where students learn sciences, computer programming and farming, amongst other life skills . Jet packs, public transport and car pooling are popular ways to get to work in the future . Alex . writes that the change came about as unemployment continued to rise in . the 1920s and there were protests to distribute jobs more fairly, . resulting in GDP being scrapped in 2029 as a way of measuring a . country's wealth. The 'index of sustainable economic . well being' and a new model of working came in, which saw people swap . labour for services via a local 'time bank' and earn extras outside . their regular work. In Porritt's vision for the future, all young people do compulsory national . service on environmental and community schemes and 'overtime is banned.' The . commute to work has also changed as there is no car ownership. The only . cars available are electric and operate as part of share schemes, while . using jet packs, walking, cycling and public transport is the norm. Talking to MailOnline about his radical vision for the UK workforce in the future, Mr Porritt said: 'People in the . UK do amazing work on a voluntary capacity and it shows there are lots . of ways to boost communities and lives, which is where quality of life . comes from. Money is not the only thing. In the fictional future the EU's 'Maximum Working Time Directive' is introduced in 2050 and in 2045 people work for just under 25 hours a week in their regular job, compared to an average of 36.4 hours in 2010 . 'We . can make material economies super efficient so that we can have the . same standard of living  with less cost on the environment. 'I . can’t see how the rich world can keep increasing the levels of material . consumption – with a rising population the sums don’t add up.' In China, complex sea defenses were erected to mitigate flood damage and tree-planting programmes increased so that the country now has a 'Great Green Wall' that covers 300 million hectares, providing some measure against encroaching deserts . An illustration of the urban farms of Detroit, which in the book was transformed in the 2020s. the city has 100 square kilometres of community farm land, which as well as providing food for city dwellers, gives them more of a work life balance . He told MailOnline that he chose the 25-hour-week as he didn't want 2050 to look unrecognisable but wanted people to see the social and economic benefits of a sizable shift in the way we work and measure productivity. He said that if he had set his novel beyond 2050 pushes it would have pushed it into the realms of science fiction. 'I don't want people to think that I've conjured it up,' he said. However, if the date was nearer, there wouldn't be enough time to change the UK's reliance on fossil fuels and the nature of the working week and many other entrenched systems, he added. A conventional cargo vessel harnessing wind and solar power using a sky sail and solar panels. It also has an anti-drag water-repelling polymer coating on its hullfor efficiency and is self-cleaning like a shark . Not all future scenarios in the book are positive:  Sana, Yemen is deserted in 2050 due to water shortages. From 2015 water had to be tankered in at great cost and the population exodus began .","Environmentalist Jonathon Porritt has imagined how the UK might look in 2050 and wants to show that sustainability is not about 'giving things up'
We could be flying in futuristic hybrid jets, growing food in giant urban greenhouses and skiing on recycling depots, according to his latest book ."
"In this window, I have had an agent threaten me and threaten one of our West Ham players with physical violence, because he thought he was being cut out of a deal. I heard of three or four agents trying to jump in on other deals. Some of these people are like scavengers. It was all deeply unpleasant and I’m glad it’s over. Now we can get on with the football.Harry Redknapp was right: it feels like gang warfare out there and I can see it spilling over into violence in the future, unless there is legislation from the FA to curb the practices. Manic times: David Sullivan has been working overtime during the transfer window . People do desperate things when they are desperate. We read of people robbing betting shops or post offices with sawn-off shotguns for £5,000. We are talking millions of pounds here around a transfer and not enough deals to go around. There are too many agents and not enough transfers to feed them. Agents who would once demand £50,000 for their part in a transfer, now want £500,000 to £1million to either bring a player or keep a player. It is quite outrageous and the FA should cap the amount paid to agents for their work. I heard of one agent, who took over representation of a player for ONE DAY, and he wanted to be paid between £1.25m and £1.5m for his part in negotiating a new contract. Making his point: Harry Redknapp likened agents' behaviour to 'gang warfare' Harry Redknapp described how agents are wrecking the transfer window earlier in the week HERE . If a player damages his cruciate ligament, or is playing badly, he will expect the club to honour his contract. If a player has six good games, it seems he and his agent rush to demand double his salary. It has become crazy and a transfer window serves only to provoke the dark forces within the game. You will have an agent who thinks he represents a player and then another who hears there may be a deal and tries to break in on the transaction. They see it as their survival money. As a chairman, you can end up dealing with three or four agents for the same player. There are a few agents who are very good at what they do (and are millionaires as a result of that), but others who want to force their way in. And do whatever it takes. Thinking about it, ‘deeply unpleasant’ is the best you can say. I greatly admire what Jeremy Peace has done at West Brom. I take my hat off to him. His player, Peter Odemwingie, drove down to QPR and was actively trying to force a transfer, but Mr Peace refused to cave in. He held his ground. He would not be bullied. Chaos: Peter Odemwingie drove himself to QPR before his switch from West Brom collapsed . For the size of that club at West Brom, they have a fantastic team. They have done unbelievably well and I have always respected him - now my admiration has doubled. You cannot give in to players like this. It is the same as giving in to terrorists or kidnappers. If you pay the ransom, they will only come back for more. Consequently, Mr Peace has done a great service to football. It has been hard work in this window. I’ve had sleepless nights. I couldn’t got to an FA Youth Cup match because I couldn’t risk leaving my home phone. I’ve had hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of calls. We signed four players (Joe Cole, Marouane Chamakh, Emanuel Pogatetz and Wellington Paulista) but I’m not satisfied. We desperately needed a left back and we didn’t get one. However, I'm confident we have a strong enough team to have a successful run-in and to finish the season strongly. For all the deals you have read about, there were 30 others we were trying. I thought we had Stephen Warnock from Aston Villa and he said he was signing. Wanted men: West Ham made attempts to bring in Stephen Warnock (left) and Paul Robinson . Our contract offer was for six months . with an extension based on appearances and he accepted that. Then he . changed his mind and signed for a Championship team in the north (Leeds). We had a deal for the Olympiacos left back, but when Warnock said yes, we scrapped that. Then, when we tried to get the other deal back on, the chap had gone somewhere else. We then spoke to Juventus left back Reto Ziegler, who's on loan in Russia and tried to make that happen, but he went to Turkey. We tried to bring in goalkeeper Paul Robinson from Blackburn, but he had an injury and hasn’t played often and we had a bit of doubt. Honestly, it makes you feel ill. I’m glad it’s over. For now. If any of our fans think we are not spending enough, can I remind you that West Ham are £100m in debt. We owe £6m in connection with Carlos Tevez - to be paid by July. We have various other debt repayments in August totalling £20m. Myself and co-owner David Gold are giving away our savings. There is only so much we can do. We are ambitious and we want to bring success to West Ham. We are doing our best. If you look at what QPR have done, possibly putting the future of the club at risk, we cannot take that gamble. Tall order: Christopher Samba (right) trains with QPR for the first time on Friday morning . They are paying wages nobody else outside the big four or five will pay, but it means they have only one player with any sell-on value. And that is the goalkeeper, who is quite brilliant - Julio Cesar, who is 33. And came on a free transfer! Let me explain: If you have a player earning £30,000-a-week, then other clubs can afford to buy him. Once you have a player earning £60,000-a-week plus, only the big four can afford to pay his wages and any transfer fee. I admire the balls of the chairman and the owners at QPR. They have broken the club record in buying Christopher Samba and if it is right that they had to pay the whole fee to Anzhi up front, plus the investment in his wages, that is a remarkable gamble for a club of their size. I wish them well. Return: Andy Carroll is back in the reckoning for West Ham . Finally, I am often asked about Andy Carroll’s deal. It is a season-long loan. Liverpool had an option to take him back in January, but he has been injured. West Ham have an agreement with Liverpool to sign him at the end of the season, but we have no agreement with the player. It was his desire to come to West Ham to prove himself to Liverpool and that hasn’t changed. He has had injuries since he came, but he is back to fitness now and we have 15 games left… we need some goals and some points, so let’s see. His return will give us a lift. We need one of our strikers to hit goal form. We’re in the middle of a poor run in a tough division and we play a very good Swansea team on Saturday. Do you know they have conceded the fewest number of goals away from home in the division? It’s nine, less than the champions, less than Manchester United and everyone else. They are an impressive club who have worked themselves up from the bottom division to the top half of the Premier League and into a cup final, without risking their financial future. Our game against them is a sell-out, the 11th successive sell-out at our ground. We are operating our ‘kids for a quid’ system for this game (the next one is the home game with Wigan), where any adult can bring as many children as they like for £1 each. It creates a family atmosphere. We believe in offering affordable football and we need a bigger ground to satisfy demand, but as you know, we are working on that, too.","Sullivan lifts the lid on the 'dark arts' deployed by agents and players .

"Rarely a week goes by without Katie Hopkins lashing out at an unsuspecting member of the public. This time, the reality star has taken aim at the newsreader Kate Silverton in her column for The Sun. The journalist has recently given birth to her second child and mentioned in the media some of the problems her female friends had been having with getting pregnant in their early forties. Scroll down for video . Kate Silverton (left) discussed problems of delaying motherhood in an interview and talked about having to bring her baby Clemency (pictured) to work one day. Katie Hopkins (left) has criticised Kate, saying most mothers don't have that option . Kate told the Evening Standard: 'There is a huge amount of pressure for the modern couple. 'You are going to have it even tougher because you will see what has happened with women who delay having children because we have been working so hard or haven’t found the right partner that you will think, ‘hang on a minute, is it better to have my children older or younger?' 'A lot of women I know are having huge difficulty trying to conceive.' The 44-year-old hasn't returned to full-time work since the birth of her second child Wilbur in June, preferring instead to make the most of her time with her young family as possible. Kate Silverton hasn't returned to full-time work since the birth of her second child Wilbur in June, preferring instead to make the most of her time with her young family as possible . But in the same interview, Kate mentioned that she had previously been so tied to a job commitment that when her husband was unable to come home to look after her their daughter Clemency one night, she took the child with her to the event she was giving a speech at. She said: 'I probably create a load of havoc in my wake bringing my children to work but if you are calm the baby is calm — it can be done. It challenges this perception that children should not be seen.' The television presenter used the example to question what needs to be done in order for women to feel they can juggle having children at an earlier age with a career. Katie claimed that Kate's job is nothing like the work commitments of the normal working woman . But Katie Hopkins this morning took offence to these comments in her newspaper column for The Sun. The 39 year old claimed that Kate's job is nothing like the work commitments of the normal working woman and that it would be extremely difficult for many workplaces to allow children. Katie said: 'This is all very well if your job is turning up to show off your impressive teeth and angular jaw. 'How about your local GP? Her three-year-old in the surgery may not be as welcome. 'I love it when mums start handing out advice and I look forward to seeing Kate reading the news with a yelling baby on her lap and a bit of milky sick on her shoulder.' It isn't the only time in recent weeks that Katie has hit out at a celebrity over topics relating to motherhood. In September she poked fun at Katie Price's decision to call her daughter Bunny.

"Tottenham Hotspur are discussing a £2.75m move for USA World Cup star and Seattle Sounders right-back DeAndre Yedlin. The pacy 21-year-old impressed in his three appearances at the World Cup, where he played under former Spurs striker and United States boss Jurgen Klinsmann, and is set to earn a move to White Hart Lane. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Spurs target Yedlin throw ceremonial pitch at the Mariners . Spurs bound? Tottenham are in talks for Seattle Sounders right-back DeAndre Yedlin . Yedlin played against Tottenham during the club's pre-season tour and is expected to finish the current Major League Soccer season with Seattle before linking up with the Premier League side in January. Roma had been considered favourites for his signature while Liverpool have also been linked. The transfer could be completed on Friday. Familiar face: Yedlin in action against former Spurs star Jermain Defoe . Yedlin played for the MLS All-Stars in a 2-1 success over Bayern Munich in Portland on Wednesday night. Talking about his proposed move to Tottenham he told the Seattle Times: 'Nothing is really finalised yet. I’m waiting, letting my agency handle it.' Former Tottenham goalkeeper Kasey Keller, now 44, warned Yedlin against against a move to White Hart Lane especially if he is only cover for Kyle Walker. ‘Spurs is a tricky place to play,' said Keller. 'They’re a team that has a lot of turnover in players. Spurs are a team that has the money, and they are always looking for a bargain, but it’s a tough place to go,’ he told Goal. Upset: Yedlin was part of the MLS All-Stars side that beat Bayern Munich on Wednesday night . ‘I just want to see young American players play regularly, week in and week out. If that’s at Tottenham, great. But if it’s not, then it’s not the right move. It’s hard to develop if you don’t play. ‘I’m not sure DeAndre would even qualify for a work permit. He’s never started a game for the national team, [England] is a tough place to get a work permit. ‘My guess would be that if Tottenham is in the race, it would be to sign DeAndre and loan him out somewhere.’","Spurs in negotiations in attempt to bring defender to White Hart Lane .

"Roberto Gomez Bolanos, the iconic Mexican comedian who wrote and played the boy television character 'El Chavo del Ocho' that defined a generation for millions of Latin American children, died Friday, the Televisa television network said. He was 85. Known as 'Chespirito,' he changed comedy in Latin America, taking his inspiration from Laurel and Hardy as well as Mexico's other transcendent comedian who eventually made it to Hollywood, Cantinflas. The cause of death was not immediately announced. Scroll down for video . Roberto Gomez Bolanos, the iconic Mexican comedian who wrote and played the boy television character 'El Chavo del Ocho' that defined a generation for millions of Latin American children, died Friday . His two most famous characters were 'El Chavo del Ocho,' who lived in the homes of Latin America and beyond with his barrel, freckles, striped shirt and frayed cap, and the naive superhero 'El Chapulin Colorado,' or 'The Crimson Grasshopper.' His morning show was a staple for preschoolers, much like 'Captain Kangaroo' in the United States. He warmed the hearts of millions with a clean comedy style far removed from the sexual innuendo and obscenity-laced jokes popular today. In a career that started in the 1950s, he wrote hundreds of television episodes, 20 films and theater productions that drew record-breaking audiences. His prolific output earned him the nickname ""Chespirito."" It came from the Spanish phonetic pronunciation of Shakespeare - ""Chespir"" - combined with ""ito,"" a diminutive commonly used in Mexico that seemed natural for Gomez Bolanos because of his short stature. ""Nicknames are the most essential in life, more valuable than names,"" the actor said in 2011. On Friday, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto tweeted, 'Mexico has lost an icon whose work has transcended generations and borders.' His morning show was a staple for preschoolers, much like 'Captain Kangaroo' in the United States . Talented both on the screen and behind it, he achieved smashing success in 1970 with the creation of 'Chespirito,' a television show that included segments about 'The Crimson Grasshopper' Born Feb. 21, 1929, he trained as an engineer, but he was dedicated to writing from a young age. Talented both on the screen and behind it, he achieved smashing success in 1970 with the creation of 'Chespirito,' a television show that included segments about 'The Crimson Grasshopper.' The goofy superhero dressed in a red bodysuit and hood with antennae that helped him detect danger miles away. He completed the outfit with yellow shorts and boots, giving him the look of a red bumblebee. The character, whose superpowers included shrinking to the size of a pill and dodging enemies, constantly repeated his signature phrases, 'You didn't count on my cleverness' and 'All the good people, follow me.' In 1971, Gomez Bolanos wrote and acted as 'El Chavo del Ocho' ('The Boy from the Eight'), a reference to the channel that broadcast the show. Many Latin Americans, living under dictatorships during the height of the show, found his underdog triumphs heroic in the face of authority . 'El Chavo' proved so popular that reruns are still shown in multiple countries in Latin American and on Spanish language television in the United States. Many Latin Americans, living under dictatorships during the height of the show, found his underdog triumphs heroic in the face of authority. In a 2005 interview with the Mexican newspaper La Jornada, Gomez Bolano said he always wrote with working class people in mind. 'There are writers who pour out words, concepts that sound really important but that basically say nothing,' he said. 'I always tried to be as concise as possible, all to try and reach everyone, but especially the simple people, those who needed to be reached more than anyone else.' He also delved successfully in theater for adults. In 1992 he produced, directed and acted in '11 and 12,' the story of a man who loses his genitals in an accident and wants to impregnate his wife. The play set a record in Mexico, surpassing 3,200 performances. Proof of his wide popularity came when he opened a Twitter account in 2011 with a simple message: 'Hello. I'm Chespirito. I'm 82-years-old and this is the first time I tweet. This is my debut. All the good people, follow me!' In less than two months, he had 1 million followers. By the time of his death, there were 6.6 million. Gomez Bolanos is survived by his second wife, actress Florinda Meza, as well as six children from his first marriage and 12 grandchildren.","Known as 'Chespirito,' he changed comedy in Latin America, taking his inspiration from Laurel and Hardy and Mexico's Cantinflas .

"British aid worker Alan Henning who was brutally beheaded by Islamic State extremists was ‘certain he was going to be freed’ in the lead up to his horrific death, a fellow hostage has claimed. Mr Henning, 47, from Salford, Manchester, is said to have ‘laughed and joked’ with other detainees when he was kidnapped by ISIS on Boxing Day last year and apparently thought he was going to be released without harm. The father of two, who had been in Syria providing aid to refugees when he was taken hostage, was murdered by the masked British militant known as Jihadi John in a video posted online on Friday. Scroll down for videos . Alan Henning, 47, was captured by ISIS militants on Boxing Day last year as he delivered aid to Syrian refugees . The father-of-two taxi driver, from Salford, Manchester, was said to be 'certain he was going to be freed' Details of his time in captivity have now been revealed by Seif al-Idlibi, an opposition activist who was held hostage with the British taxi driver when he was first kidnapped. In his first detailed account of the ordeal, Mr Idlibi - who was freed in January after the detention centre he was being held at was liberated by Syrian rebels - said Mr Henning was 'very relaxed' in captivity. He told the Daily Telegraph: ‘He didn’t understand who his captors were and he was convinced he would be released soon. ‘He was not afraid – he thought it was just a regular security check and that he would be released soon.' According to Mr Idlibi, the detention centre where he was held overnight with Mr Henning was located in the northwestern town of al-Dana, in the depths of a government building which ISIS captured in November 2012. He said Mr Henning was interrogated by three separate captors throughout the night, including the masked British militant Jihadi John and the Isil-appointed emir of the local town Idlib, Abu Dujana Al-Tunsi. The aid worker was beheaded by a masked militant - believed to be Jihadi John - in an ISIS video posted online . Mr Henning had been providing aid to Syrian refugees when he was kidnapped by ISIS militants on Boxing Day . Fellow hostage Seif al-Idlibi said Mr Henning was 'laughing and joking' during the time they spent together in captivity. Pictured: Mr Henning being filmed last year during a BBC documentary about sending aid to Syria . However, he said Mr Henning remained in good spirits and later laughed and joked with his cellmates who woke him to alert him to his snoring. Mr Idlibi said he laughed and apologised, saying he had been awake for 24 hours. The next morning, a guard came for Mr Henning, telling him to bring his belongings with him. Kissing his cellmates goodbye, Mr Idlibi said it was clear that he thought the worst was over. ‘He was crying with empathy as he said goodbye – he thought he was being freed and leaving us behind. We don’t know where they took him,' he said. Instead of being freed, Mr Henning was transferred deeper into the extensive prison network of ISIS. He was not sighted again in public until the jihadist group released a video showing the beheading of British aid worker, David Haines, two weeks ago. Then, on Friday, Mr Henning became the fourth Westerner and second Briton  to be murdered by the Islamic State. As before, the video depicted Mr Henning, dressed in an orange jumpsuit, kneeling alongside his black-clad, masked killer. In the recording he recited: ‘Because of our Parliament’s decision to attack the Islamic State, I, as a member of the British public, will now pay the price for that decision.’ Barbara Henning and her family joined mourners at a service for her husband in Eccles, Manchester, yesterday . Reverend Cyprian Yobera led the service where he spoke about Mr Henning at length and asked worshippers to light candles in his memory.

Floral tributes in memory of the air workers have been placed on a monument known as the Eccles Cross . Yesterday, the grieving family of Mr Henning joined hundreds of mourners, including leaders of the Muslim community, at a service of reflection. His wife Barbara, and two children Lucy, 17, and Adam, 15, were embraced in emotional scenes at St Mary’s Church in Eccles, Manchester. The Rev Cyprian Yobera asked the congregation to have understanding even when ‘our world seems to be infested by those who do not value life’. He added: ‘It is difficult at a time like this when we have to deal with tragedy that we cannot understand. Everybody feels like they knew him, even those of us who never met him.’ The streets of Eccles were transformed into a sea of yellow and ribbons adorned with the words ‘Alan, our hero’ were fixed to every lamppost, bench and tree. Mrs Henning, 45, said that news of the killing had left the family ‘numb with grief’. She praised her husband as a ‘decent, caring human being’ whose ‘interest was in the welfare of others’. The Bishop of Manchester, the Rt Rev Dr David Walker, described Mr Henning as a martyr who had paid ‘the ultimate sacrifice’ for his good deeds. He said: 'The Christian faith is centred around a man who did good, enormous good, and who actually paid with his life for it. ‘Alan stands in that fine tradition. Since the time of Jesus Christ, we have a word ‘martyrdom’ in the Christian faith for it, those who do good and end up paying the ultimate sacrifice for it.’ A cross in Eccles, Greater Manchester, has become an impromptu shrine for the popular taxi driver .

The streets of Eccles have been transformed into a sea of yellow with ribbons  fixed to lampposts and benches . Mr Henning was a well-known figure in the town due to his tireless charity work and lengthy career driving taxis. One message attached to Eccles Cross in the town centre read: ‘Whilst we come to terms with this living nightmare, your suffering is over. You leave an irreplaceable gap in all our lives.' ‘A special man with a heart of gold,’ read another. Friends of Mr Henning – known affectionately as Gadget due to his love of technology - stood on the Greater Manchester town’s quiet streets yesterday sharing stories about him. Anthony Flannery condemned the ‘appalling’ killing and expressed his disappointment that the Government had not done more to free the hostage. The retired 64-year-old said: ‘It’s harder to take because he was really doing some good. ‘We really had a little light of hope that he might be coming back, especially when we heard Cameron making a speech about how we don’t give in to terrorists. Mr Flannery added: ‘It’s hard to describe how I feel. It’s like losing a part of yourself.’ ‘He knew the dangers and he went forward because he was all about helping people. He had a good heart.' Barbara Henning said the family is 'numb with grief' after being told her husband had been killed by ISIS . Colin Livesey described his brother-in-law's killers as 'scum', adding: 'I hope they get what's coming to them' Manchester Central Mosque Iman Asim Hussain yesterday criticised ISIS, calling them ‘misguided individuals’. A visibly emotional Shameela Islam-Fulfigar, a doctor at Tameside Hospital who was part of the last convoy on which Mr Henning travelled, said: ‘The world lost an honourable and remarkable hero.’ She has set up an online memorial fund, in consultation with Mrs Henning, aiming to raise £20,000. Dr Islam-Fulfigar said she wanted to show the taxi driver’s children that ‘their father’s death was not in vain and that the work that Alan was so committed to will also continue’.","Alan Henning, 47, was providing aid in Syria when taken hostage last year .

"For most people the idea of losing friends overtime can leave them fearful of being alone in old age, but new research suggests that having fewer friends can actually make us less lonely. A study that examined the friendships of nearly 400,000 students  has shown that while the number of close friends they have on average has fallen in the past 25 years, they feel less isolated. Psychologists believe modern technology and the increased use of social media to interact with other people, and has led to the decline in face-to-face contact, has driven this change. Recent studies have suggested that people have fewer close friends that they can confide in than they had in, but the latest research shows that this is not necessarily leading to people feeling lonelier . The research, conducted by psychologists at the University of Queensland in Australia, showed that loneliness among American college students has declined between 1978 and 2009. Similarly loneliness among high school students has also declined between 1991 and 2012 as the size of their friendship groups contracted. 'People become less dependent on their families and need more specialized skills, which could lead to less interest in social support and more self-sufficiency,' said lead researcher Dr David Clark, from the University of Queensland. 'Over time, people are more individualistic, more extroverted, and have higher self-esteem.' He added: 'The trend in loneliness may be caused by modernization.' The findings come after a series of studies have shown that the growing use of social networking sites like Facebook has had a negative affect on the quality of people's friendships. Other studies have suggested that people who use Facebook tend to be more isolated and lonely. Lonely people are also more likely to share more information about themselves on such sites. A study from 2006 by sociologists at Duke also showed that on average most adults only have two people they can talk to about the most important subjects in their lives while one quarter had no close confidants at all. This has led to predictions that society is growing increasingly lonely. However, the latest findings, which are published in the journal of Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, shows people are actually getting less lonely. The scientists examined 48 surveys of American College Students who had completed the Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale, with a total of 13,041 students taking part. Although we have close fewer friends to confide in, we seem to be more contented  and modern technology may be responsible according to the to the research by psychologists at the University of Queensland . This showed that overall loneliness declined from 1978 to 2009, with female students reported lower loneliness than male college students. The researchers also looked at the results from the Monitoring the Future project between 1991 and 2012, which surveyed US high school students about their behaviours, attitudes and values. Overall, the high school students reported having fewer friends with whom to interact, but less desire for more friends. Dr Clark said further research on cultures outside of the US would help determine if modernization is the root cause of the observed results. He said: 'If other cultures show the same pattern of reduced loneliness in the face of poorer social networks, this would support the idea that modernization is responsible.'","Modern technology and social network sites like Facebook may be behind the falling levels of loneliness .

"Conspiracy forums have been set ablaze this week after a lady claiming to be a former Nasa employee said she had seen humans on Mars. The woman, named 'Jackie', called into American radio station, Coast to Coast AM, with a 'confession' that she had witnessed suited men running on the red planet in 1979. Jackie said she was working as part of a 'downstairs' team downloading telemetry from a Viking Lander when she saw the humans via live feed. Scroll down for audio . The woman, named 'Jackie', called in to American radio station, Coast to Coast AM, with a 'confession' that she had witnessed suited men running on the red planet in 1979 Jackie said she was working as part of a 'downstairs' team downloading telemetry from a Viking Lander (pictured) when she saw the humans . 'I wonder if you could solve a 27-year-old mystery for me,' she asked the presenter. 'That old Viking rover was running around. 'Then I saw two men in space suits - not the bulky suits we normally used, but they looked protective. They came over the horizon walking to the Viking Explorer.' Nasa has not corroborated the story, but this hasn't stopped conspiracy theorists from claiming it as evidence for a 'secret space programme.' According to Jackie, six other Nasa workers saw the two humans walking on the red planet's surface. 'We ran upstairs – but they locked the door, and taped paper over the door so we couldn't see,' she said. 'My question is – were they our guys?' The Viking Mars mission was performed by two spacecraft, Viking 1 and Viking 2, launched within a couple of weeks of each other in the 1970s. Each spacecraft consisted of an orbiter and a lander, which travelled attached together for nearly a year to reach Mars orbit. The orbiters then began taking pictures of the Martian surface, from which a landing site was selected. The landers then separated from the orbiters and soft landed. Earlier this week, physicist Dr John Brandenburg said he believes an ancient civilisation on Mars was wiped out by a nuclear attack from another alien race. Dr Brandenburg says ancient Martians known as Cydonians and Utopians were massacred in the attack - and evidence of the genocide can still be seen today. Back in 2011 the scientist first postulated that the red colour on Mars could have been due to a naturally occurring thermonuclear explosion. 'The Martian surface is covered with a thin layer of radioactive substances including uranium, thorium and radioactive potassium - and this pattern radiates from a hot spot on Mars,' he told Fox News at the time. 'A nuclear explosion could have sent debris all around the planet.' But since then he has advanced his theory to the level that he now no longer thinks it was a naturally occurring explosion - but rather one planned by an intelligent alien race. According to Vice, the conclusion of his latest paper says that nuclear isotopes in the atmosphere resembling hydrogen bomb tests 'may present an example of civilisation wiped out by a nuclear attack from space.' Earlier this week, physicist Dr John Brandenburg said he believes an ancient civilisation on Mars was wiped out by a nuclear attack from another alien race. He says there is evidence for two nuclear explosions on Mars (image from his paper shown) The orbiters continued imaging and, between Viking 1 and Viking 2, imaged the entire planet at what was then high resolution. 'Although no traces of life were found, Viking found all elements essential to life on Earth - carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen and phosphorus - were present on Mars,' said Nasa. ‘There are a few problems with Jackie's testimony,’ Nigel Watson, UFO expert, and author of the book Haynes, UFO Investigations Manual told MailOnline. ‘Firstly, the Viking landing craft did not send a live TV feed back to Earth, and as its name suggests it simply landed on the Martian surface, it did not have wheels like the latest Curiosity craft. Her grasp of technological terms seems hazy and of course by remaining anonymous it is virtually 'impossible to know if she really worked for Nasa.’ The story does however strike a note with conspiracy theorists who believe that Nasa and other human agencies have secretly visited Mars and established colonies there. 'I wonder if you could solve a 27-year-old mystery for me,' she asked the presenter. 'That old Viking rover was running around. Then I saw two men in space suits - not the bulky suits we normally used, but they looked protective. They came over the horizon walking to the Viking Explorer'. Pictured is a view of Mars . ‘Other conspiracy theorists who believe the moon landings were faked, note that Jackie might have inadvertently seen the fakery behind the Viking missions,’ said Mr Watson. ‘Officially, the two Viking landing craft touched down on Mars in 1976, but according to this viewpoint they were set up at a remote desert location and Jackie accidently saw a feed revealing this fakery. ‘The missions are faked to hide the real activity going on in outer space, which could include collaborating with aliens who already live on Mars.’ Jackie's claim follows a similarly bizarre theory by physicist Dr John Brandenburg who believes an ancient civilisation on Mars was wiped out by a nuclear attack from another alien race. Dr Brandenburg says ancient Martians known as Cydonians and Utopians were massacred in the attack - and evidence of the genocide can still be seen today. He claims his theory could explain the Fermi Paradox - namely why, if the universe is abundant with life, we haven't heard anything from anyone else yet. He warns, though, that we need to be fearful of an attack on our own planet, and should mount a manned mission to Mars to know what we're up against.","Woman, named 'Jackie', called in to US radio station, Coast to Coast AM .

"Ray Rice's wife Janay has said she initially thought she was 'done' with the running back after he punched her in an elevator - but her 'heart' told her to stay with him. She told Today's Matt Lauer that she was 'furious' with the former Baltimore Ravens player in the aftermath of the attack, however she knew her relationship would not be over because she believed it wasn't like him. The pair will be interviewed together for the first time since Ray was indicted on aggravated assault charges in March. In a newly-released first person account with ESPN, she also described how she was annoyed with Rice because it was Valentines Day, and she wanted to go out as a couple - but ended up being with friends. She also said that she was drunk when Rice 'slapped' her in the elevator and her memory of the events is foggy. Scroll down for video . Ray Rice's wife Janay said that after the incident in the Atlantic City elevator, she thought she was done with the running back. But she realized the violence was not like him and the pair reconciled . She told Today's Matt Lauer (left) that she was 'furious' with the former Baltimore Ravens player in the aftermath of the attack, however she knew her relationship would not be over . Janay defends her newlywed husband as an appeal to end his indefinite suspension in the NFL was granted by a U.S. District Judge. It means Rice is now eligible to sign with any NFL team - and can do so as soon as he receives an offer. CCTV in the elevator of an Atlantic City Casino caught the player punching his then fiance Janay to the floor. 'I was furious,' Janay told Lauer. 'We came home and we didn't talk the entire ride. 'I just knew he hit me, and I was done. I just didn't even want to entertain it. Any explanation.' Describing her reaction to the elevator incident, she said: 'Of course in the back of my mind and in my heart I knew that our relationship wouldn't be over because I know that this isn't us and it's not him,' Since then the pair have reconciled and got married a month after his arrest for aggravated assault. Earlier this month, Palmer - now Janay Rice - spoke to ESPN about the Atlantic City incident, saying it stemmed from an 'insignificant' argument between her and her husband. She told the station's Jemele Hill: 'As we were arguing, he was on his phone and not looking at me. I went to reach for his phone, and when he grabbed it back, he spit at me and I slapped him. Controversial: Rice, pictured with his wife arriving at appeal hearing earlier this month, has had the indefinite suspension from the NFL overturned and he is now eligible to play for any team . 'We got into the elevator and what happened inside is still foggy to me. The only thing I know - and I can't even say I ""remember"" because I only know from what Ray has told me - is that I slapped him again and then he hit me. I remember nothing else from inside the elevator.' After coming round in the casino lobby, surrounded by police, Palmer was taken to the police station with her husband, who kept telling her 'It's going to be okay. We'll be okay'. Explaining her decision for standing by Rice, she said although she was 'angry', she 'knew it wasn't him' and he had never acted like that before. 'No matter how long we have known each other and no matter what the circumstance is, Ray understands that violent behavior like this, even one time, is never acceptable,' she said. Shocking: Rice was suspended by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell for only two games following the one-punch knockout of his then-fiancée in an elevator at the New Jersey-based casino in February. CCTV captured the attack . Initially, Rice was suspended by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell for only two games following the one-punch knockout of his then-fiancée in an elevator at the New Jersey-based casino in February. However, after security video of the altercation surfaced on TMZ in September, the Ravens released the three-time Pro Bowler, and his $35 million contract, and the NFL suspended him indefinitely. The day after Rice was released from his contract, Janay took to her Instagram to describe the 'horrible nightmare' she found herself in. Newlyweds: The pair got married even after he was indicted on third degree aggravated assault charges . Criticism over the two-day action led the NFL to toughen its penalties on domestic violence, with Mr Goodell admitting in a letter to team owners that he 'didn't get it right'. During the appeal, Rice's lawyers and the union argued the league had overstepped its authority in modifying former running back's two-game suspension, saying he was being 'sentenced' twice. In addition to testimonies from both Rice and Palmer - who supported her husband - Judge Jones heard from NFL security chief Jeffrey Miller and Ravens general manager Ozzie Newsome. In her decision on Friday, Judge Jones wrote: 'Because Rice did not mislead the commissioner and because there were no new facts on which the commissioner could base his increased suspension, I find that the imposition of the indefinite suspension was arbitrary. Consequences: After security video of the altercation surfaced on TMZ in September, the Ravens released the three-time Pro Bowler, and his $35 million contract . 'I therefore vacate the second penalty imposed on Rice. The provisions of the first discipline - those regarding making continued use of counseling and other professional services, having no further involvement with law enforcement, and not committing any additional violations of league policies - still stand.' Rice is not the only NFL player to have sparked anger among fans due to alleged violence. In September, Minnesota Vikings' star running back Adrian Peterson was arrested for disciplining his four-year-old son by striking him with a wooden switch. Peterson pleaded no contest in a Texas courtroom to a misdemeanor assault charge following his arrest and was told to pay a $4,000 (£2,550) fine and undertake community service. The NFL did not immediately comment on Rice's verdict.","Pair will be interviewed together for the first time since elevator attack .

"No, he's not Johnny Footbrawl. Johnny Manziel, 21, said he did everything he could to escape a 'very aggressive' fan before an altercation in the lobby of the Browns rookie quarterback's apartment building. Speaking on Friday for the first time since last week's incident, Manziel said the man, identified in a police report as Chris Gonos, was 'a very intoxicated, very aggressive person that approached me in the lobby.' Manziel said he went out dinner on Friday night with his mother and roommate and had returned to The 9, a downtown hotel where he has an apartment, when he was confronted by 'what has been made out to be a fan.' Manziel did not name Gonos but said the man was 'putting his hands on me, kind of toying with me.' Scroll down for video . 'It was an unfortunate situation': Cleveland Browns quarterback Johnny Manziel addressed the fight he was allegedly involved in at his Cleveland apartment last Saturday for the first time on Friday (pictured) The Cleveland Browns quarterback was involved in a fight during the early hours of Saturday morning after a member of his entourage attacked a fan for trying to hug the rookie quarterback . The popular former Heisman Trophy winner said he and his roommate tried to coax the man into another elevator and 'the guy got very aggressive' before security was able to intervene. Manziel declined to provide any details about the skirmish, which police said took place at 2:30 a.m., and he would not say if he threw any punches. The incident was initially reported as a 'riot' involving 20 men. Manziel showed no visible markings from the altercation. Manziel said he does not plan to press charges. Gonos had told police he was struck and assaulted by 'Johnny Football and his entourage'. Following the incident it emerged Gonos and some family members pleaded guilty to conspiracy to structure financial transactions to evade filing currency transaction reports in October 2013, relating to a family restaurant business, according to The Sandusky Register. Manziel dismissed the idea that he's surrounded by people when he's out in public. 'There is no entourage, I live with one other person and my mother was upstairs,' the first-round draft pick said. 'That's about as much entourage as you get, being with my mom. ' Manziel said he has interactions with fans on a daily basis and typically enjoys them. 'I'm approached by fans every single day in Cleveland,' he said. 'There's nothing I love more than when somebody comes up and talks to me about the history of the Browns or how passionate they are about this team. 'I treat every fan the same, with a lot of respect, and I'm very thankful for them being the fans that they are. I don't think our league would be that without them. 'It was a very unfortunate situation, a situation that was tried to be averted at all costs and one that I was unfortunately not able to really get away from.' Punched: Chris Gonos, left, the alleged victim in the incident, said the brawl began after he approached Manziel, right, and asked if he could hug him . Gonos told Cleveland.com that the brawl began when he noticed Manziel while waiting for an elevator. Gonos said he approached Manziel and said: 'I'm the biggest Browns fan ever, I love you, I want to give you a hug.' As Gonos stepped toward Manziel, he was punched in the face and beaten by another man with the Browns quarterback, leaving Gonos with a swollen lip and swollen right eye. 'One of his buddies like tackled me,' Gonos told the website. 'It was going down, a whole bunch of people started fighting. It ended pretty quick. I got a bruised hip and a bruised elbow and somebody hit me in the back of the head.' Gonos said no-one was arrested but his brother 'tackled' Manziel and added, 'I guess Johnny sucker-punched him while the security guard was holding him. It should be all on video. 'I know somebody else in the group smashed Johnny right in the face. Smashed him.' Manziel said he called Browns general manager Ray Farmer and coach Mike Pettine immediately after he awoke on Saturday to explain what happened. 'I'm very thankful for the Browns having my back in all this and supporting me in a situation that seemed to be a little blown out of proportion,' he said. Farmer had said the team was concerned about the time the incident took place. Manziel said his lifestyle has changed 'dramatically' since he came to Cleveland. Manziel, who has gained a reputation for making headlines for his off-the-field antics, has been relatively quiet since joining the Cleveland Browns after the NFL Draft in May . There was a lot made of his out-of-town partying during the offseason, but the 22-year-old understands he has a responsibility to the Browns. 'I know there's other guys around the league and other guys in this locker room that do the same thing and enjoy their time when they're out of the building,' he said, 'and I know that at night when I go to bed I need to make sure that I'm ready and capable of going to work the next day and doing my job to the duties that I have being in this building the next day.' Manziel has only been on the field for a few plays this season as he backs up starter Brian Hoyer. Earlier this week, Pettine said the late-night incident had not affected Manziel's standing with the team or playing status. Manziel opened his interview session by thanking local media members for 'not jumping out to any wild conclusions like some other people do.'","Police were called to Manziel's Cleveland apartment complex after a report of a 'riot' involving 20 men and two security guards at 2.36 am Saturday .

"The most jaw-dropping segment of the Miss Universe competition occurred last night (no, we're not talking about the swimwear round.) The contestants in the 63rd annual competition took part in the National Costume show at Florida International University in Miami. . The ladies wore an elaborate range of costumes spanning from the Buckingham Palace Queen's Guard to the national tree of Venezuela. Scroll down for video .

"Manchester United are refusing to give up in their attempts to prise Brazilian defender Marquinhos away from Paris Saint-Germain, despite the French club's reluctance to part with the player. Marquinhos is a 20-year-old central defender who is among the most highly rated young talents in world football. He has enjoyed two impressive seasons for PSG since signing for the club in the summer of 2013 in a deal that is thought to have approached £30m when he was only 19 years of age. United are believed to have made enquiries in the January transfer window but were knocked back in no uncertain terms by the Parisians. PSG defender Marquinhos remains a target for Manchester United . United are looking to bolster their defence this summer. Nathaniel Clyne is a leading target at right back, while they will also seek to recruit two centre-halves of elite standing. Marquinhos is believed to be one of those being closely monitored by Louis van Gaal. PSG view him as a long-term mainstay of their defence and the French club do not wish to sell the 20-year-old Brazilian but they are aware of growing and sustained interest from Old Trafford. PSG are also conscious that despite Marquinhos being Brazilian, he has a European passport, meaning that he does not take up a non-EU place in their squad. This only increases the player's value to the club as only four non-EU citizens are permitted in a squad in Ligue 1. If United wish to bring PSG to the negotiating table, it will require an offer that usurps the £30m that they paid for Rio Ferdinand in 2002 and the £40m that Manchester City are reported to have shelled out for Eliaquim Mangala last summer. Even a British record fee for a defender, however, may not be enough to persuade PSG to sell, with the club so far resolute in their determination to brush off United's interest. Marquinhos takes on Eden Hazard during PSG's Champions League game with Chelsea . Marquinhos' agent has gone public in recent weeks to state that the defender is target for several of Europe's leading clubs, including United, but that could also be a ploy to force PSG into offering improved terms to the player. Reports in France suggest those talks are continuing with the French club. Sources close to PSG have told Sportsmail that Marquinhos is happy to remain at the club, while many who work around the club have been impressed by his skill, attitude and dedication. After only a few months at the club, Marquinhos was already conducting mixed zone interviews in French and he recently described PSG coach Laurent Blanc as 'the best coach a young defender could wish to have.' Marquinhos (right) celebrates with Thiago Silva (centre) and Adrien Rabiot . However, PSG wish to strengthen significantly this summer and the demands of Financial Fair Play may force them to move players out in order to bring in recruitments. There is increasing speculation that Edinson Cavani and Ezequiel Lavezzi could be among the contenders but a David Luiz-style bid for Marquinhos could force the French club to think long and hard. The extraordinary television rights deal in England has also not gone unnoticed by senior figures in France. While Premier League clubs will tap into a £5billion jackpot from 2016, the Ligue 1 rights deal is worth only £538m to French clubs per season, compared to the £1.7b that Premier League clubs will rake in from Sky Sports and BT. Marquinhos tries to take the ball off Chelsea's Diego Costa during the Champions League game . It only strengthens the position of Manchester United, Manchester City and Chelsea in the transfer market while placing a squeeze on PSG, who also have to cope with higher tax demands in France. There is a growing fear that it could further fuel the competitive imbalance in the European transfer market. Marquinhos, for his part, has played a significant role in the PSG backline this season but he has often been forced to deputise at right full-back, rather than in his favoured central defensive position. Intriguingly, many regular observers of this PSG outfit discern that Marquinhos is already a more accomplished centre-back than David Luiz and Thiago Silva.","Manchester United will have to offer more than £30m for Marquinhos .

"The parents of an American aid worker who has been captured by ISIS and threatened with beheading have released an emotional letter he wrote them while captured by the extremists. Abdul-Raham Kassig, from Indianapolis, was seized by the terror group a year ago while giving aid to Syrians - and was singled out in their latest gory execution video as their next victim. Paula and Ed Kassig, the 26-year-old's mother and father,  today revealed parts of a letter they received from him which speaks of his fear at the prospect of becoming ISIS's next victim. Aid worker: Peter Kassig (left), who has been held captive by ISIS for the past year, first went to the Middle East as a U.S. soldier before returning as a medical worker. Right, he is threatened by an ISIS militant . Emotional plea: Ed and Paula Kassig (above) released parts of the heartfelt letter they received from their son on June 2 this year . Kassig, a former U.S. Army Ranger, converted to Islam in captivity. He was formerly known as Peter, but his family have asked media outlets to refer to him by his Islamic name, Abdul-Rahman. But it also implores his parents to 'take comfort' in the fact that it was his commitment to helping other people that led to him being captured. In the message he says: 'I am obviously pretty scared to die but the hardest part is not knowing, wondering, hoping, and wondering if I should even hope at all. Growing up: Abdul-Rahman, formerly Peter, Kassig is pictured above with his father on a fishing holiday . As a child: Abdul-Rahman is pictured above with his mother in front of a waterfall as a boy . 'I am very sad that all this has happened and for what all of you back home are going through. If I do die, I figure that at least you and I can seek refuge and comfort in knowing that I went out as a result of trying to alleviate suffering and helping those in need.' 'I wish this paper would go on forever and never run out and I could just keep talking to you. Just know I’m with you.' The Kassig family received the letter on June 2, but have only just made parts of it public, along with two photographs of him growing up. They also issued a statement explaining how he converted to Islam, a process which they say had already begun when he was taken hostage. They say he had come to 'admire and respect' the Syrian Muslims he was helping, and had fasted during Ramadan in July and August 2013. A former hostage told them he had converted fully by December 2013, at which point he took on a new name and began praying five times a day. In his letter he wrote: 'In terms of my faith, I pray everyday and I am not angry about my situation in that sense. I am in a dogmatically complicated situation here, but I am at peace with my belief.' His parents, who have already released a video pleading for mercy from ISIS, then repeated their message, and also said that they disagree with the U.S. government's actions against the group. They wrote: 'We ask the world to continue to pray for him and for all innocent people harmed by violence and war. We continue to pressure the government to stop its actions and continue to call on his captors to have mercy and release him.' Aid worker: Kassig is pictured above with a friend in Syria working with his non-profit organization, SERA . Kassig first went to the Middle East as a U.S. soldier before returning as a medical worker to help victims of war. While in Turkey, he founded SERA (Special Emergency Response and Assistance), a medically-oriented emergency relief group that serves refugee populations and internally displaced persons. It was while working on a project for SERA almost exactly a year ago, on October 1, 2013, when he was captured by members of ISIS as he headed to Deir Ezzor in eastern Syria. On Friday he was threatened with death in a chilling video showing the beheading of 47-year-old British aid worker Alan Henning. Supplies: Kassig is seen above with a truck of supplies to be given to victims of the conflict in the Middle East . He was shown kneeling in the desert at the end of the footage, which saw a masked militant tell President Barack Obama that U.S. 'aerial bombardments' are putting them under strain. The militant added: 'It's only right we continue to strike the necks of your people. The beheading of Henning yesterday followed the murders of three other hostages in similar circumstance: U.S. journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and British aid worker David Haines. U.S. officials have confirmed that Mr Kassig is being held by Islamic State militants, but have declined to give any more details of his capture. After the video surfaced, President Obama strongly condemned the killing and urged that U.S. forces and its allies will bring his killers to justice. 'Mr Henning worked to help improve the lives of the Syrian people and his death is a great loss for them, for his family and the people of the United Kingdom,' he said in a statement. 'Standing together with our U.K. friends and allies, we will work to bring the perpetrators of Alan's murder - as well as the murders of Jim Foley, Steven Sotloff and David Haines - to justice.' The President added that the U.S. and other nations will continue to take action to 'degrade and ultimately destroy' the Islamic State group. This is the letter that Paula and Ed Kassig received from their son in captivity. Before it was released the text was edited for length and sensitive information redacted: . 'The first thing I want to say is thank you. Both to you and mom for everything you have both done for me as parents; for everything you have taught me, shown me, and experienced with me. 'I cannot imagine the strength and commitment it has taken to raise a son like me but your love and patience are things I am so deeply grateful for. 'I am obviously pretty scared to die but the hardest part is not knowing, wondering, hoping, and wondering if I should even hope at all. 'I am very sad that all this has happened and for what all of you back home are going through. 'If I do die, I figure that at least you and I can seek refuge and comfort in knowing that I went out as a result of trying to alleviate suffering and helping those in need. 'In terms of my faith, I pray everyday and I am not angry about my situation in that sense. I am in a dogmatically complicated situation here, but I am at peace with my belief. 'I wish this paper would go on forever and never run out and I could just keep talking to you. Just know I’m with you. 'Every stream, every lake, every field and river. In the woods and in the hills, in all the places you showed me. I love you.'","Abdul-Rahman Kassig, 26, was captured by terror group in Syria last year .

"Thousands of Walmart workers have descended on stores across the country to protest against low wages and part-time schedules in massive coordinated Black Friday strikes. Swarms of protesters gathered at 1,600 Walmarts in 49 states on Friday morning to picket the stores or stage sit-ins, while other workers started walking out on their shifts as early as Wednesday. The employees are protesting poor wages, which are often so low that they put workers below the poverty line - even though the company makes $16 billion a year in profit. While some are paid $8 or $9 an hour, Walmart's largest stockholders - Christy, Jim, Alice and S. Robson Walton - enjoy the title of America's richest family. Together they are worth $145 billion. Scroll down for video . Protest: Larry Born, a former Walmart employee from Park Forest, Illinois, takes part in a demonstration for higher wages and better working conditions outside of a Walmart during Black Friday shopping in Chicago . Anger: Donna Cammon, a Walmart employee from Chicago, takes part in the demonstration. Many workers are below the poverty line and are calling for higher wages and benefits, such as health insurance . Braving the cold: Protesters hold up signs outside the Walmart in Watertown, Wisconsin on Black Friday . The company also routinely gives workers part-time hours so that they are not entitled to benefits such as health insurance, Mother Jones pointed out. Walmart pays many of its workers less than $25,000 a year, Bloomberg reported, with some full-time employees averaging $15,500. The 2014 federal poverty line for a family of four is $23,850. A recent report commissioned by Congressional Democrats found that each Walmart costs taxpayers between 900,000 and $1.75 million per year as so many workers have to rely on government aid. The protests on Friday were organized by the union-backed Organization for Respect at Walmart (OUR Walmart), which was founded in 2011. Workers took part in the protests, but they were also joined by other members of their communities. The group is getting louder; just two years ago, protesters picketed 28 stores compared to this year's 1,600. In Washington, there are protests at every one of the state's 64 stores. On strike: Walmart workers, pictured in a Maryland store, stage a sit-in in protest of the poor conditions . Protest: Members of the protest group, including Zach Blume, left, are calling for more full-time work . Causing trouble: JoEllen Schlademan is removed from the street by a police officer during a demonstration in Chicago. In the city, seven workers were arrested for blocking traffic while outside stores . In an appeal on its Facebook group on Thursday, the group wrote: 'Today we are thankful for all of us who are on strike today to protest how Walmart abuses their power and extraordinary wealth to stop Associates from speaking out. 'After years of being paid so little that many of us skip meals just to get by, we have joined OUR Walmart to challenge the richest family in America to pay us more. The right to speak freely and protest are fundamental to America and the only way will make change. Join us this Black Friday.' This year, workers walked out of their shifts across California, Florida, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, Wisconsin, and Washington, D.C, Mother Jones reported. In Chicago, 11 people associated with the OUR Walmart group were arrested while blocking traffic in front of a downtown store. In Washington D.C., some staged a sit-down strike. 'Wal-Mart, Wal-Mart you're no good. Treat your workers like you should,' a crowd of several dozen shouted outside the store in Chicago. Rich: Alice Walton, Jim Walton and Wal-Mart Chairman Rob Walton, children of the company's founder, are seen in 2011. With another relative, they are worth $145bn - making them the country's wealthiest family . Wealthy: Christy Walton, left, also shares their fortune. Right, their father, Walmart founder Sam Walton . 'I'm 32 and I am nowhere near where my parents were at this time in their lives,' Shomari Lewis, a worker from a Walmart in Dallas, told the publication. He makes around $9 an hour. 'I thought getting a job a the nation's largest employer would be a great way to start a career, but boy, was I wrong… I don't know how we are supposed to have families or raise them when Walmart is keeping us in poverty.' Another worker, Richard Reynoso, from Los Angeles, said he hadn't eaten since yesterday. 'The hunger I'm experiencing right now is all too familiar,' he said. 'Many Walmart workers experience it every day… [but] nobody who works for the richest company in America should ever experience that kind of thing.' Brooke Buchanan, a Wal-Mart spokeswoman, played down the impact of the protests. She said past protests have focused on a handful of locations with a handful of workers. 'Perception is not reality in this case. We've seen this story before,' she said. She added: 'The crowds are mostly made up of paid union demonstrators, and they do not represent the views of the 1.3 million associates' who work for the company. Support: Members of the community came out in support of Walmart workers in Lakewood, Colorado . Demands: They are calling for $15 an hour. Many employees reported earning $8 or $9 an hour . Disgruntled: Workers gathered at a staggering 1,600 stores across 49 states to protest the conditions . Buchanan also said one of the demonstrators hit a customer at the Chicago store, prompting a complaint to the police. Last month, the company announced that, from January 1, it will no longer offer health insurance to employees who work less than an average of 30 hours a week. The move, which would affect 30,000 employees, follows similar decisions by Target, Home Depot and others to eliminate health insurance benefits for part-time employees. The store also recently made headlines after an employee organized a food drive for fellow workers at an Oklahoma City store. A bake sale was also held by employees in need in Indiana along as campaigners put pressure on the company not to ignore the voices of employees who are going hungry. The company employs 1.4 million people, which is nearly 10 per cent of all retail workers in the U.S.","Protesters planned to picket at 1,600 stores across 49 states on Friday .

He recommends drinking cheap, new varieties made from grapes grown at higher altitudes.These are exposed to higher levels of UV radiation, giving them a greater concentration of antioxidants. Among the cardiologist’s preferred varieties are a Pinot Noir or a Shiraz from South Africa, an Argentinian Malbec or his particular favourite, a Cabernet Sauvignon from Chile. The consultant prescribes the drink to . patients in the cardiology ward like he would any other medicine, with . precise measures to be taken at regular intervals. He says their good . results support the theory that drinking a small amount every day can be . beneficial. Dr McCrea began . to hand out wine after discovering that the French suffer from far . fewer heart attacks, despite their fatty diets and higher smoking rates. He believes the . antioxidant properties of red wine reduce the risk of second heart . attacks by half – and the risk of stroke by 20 per cent. The . cardiologist has now recommended two 125ml glasses a day to around . 10,000 patients at the Great Western Hospital in Swindon, Wiltshire. And . he insists that young wines in screw-top bottles – which are usually . the cheapest – are the healthiest varieties. Fortunately . his local supermarkets usually stock enough of his recommended tipple, a . Montes Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon which costs around £7 a bottle. Dr . McCrea, 58, explained: ‘The French consume twice the amount of fat we . do, smoke more, and they don’t do any more exercise than us, but their . rate of deaths from heart attacks is half of ours. What’s the . difference? They drink red wine like we drink tea. ‘It’s . their drinking behaviour that’s important. The British don’t drink . alcohol regularly, but when we do, we drink to excess. They don’t, as a . rule. Dr McCrea, who works at Great Western Hospital, in Swindon (pictured), has given red wine to 10,000 patients over the last 10 years and says the results among his patients are notable . ‘Also the wine cheers . patients up and focuses them on their recovery by relaxing them during a . very tense period. Hardly any of my patients who have a heart attack . who go on to have red wine ever come back into the hospital again, which . is unusual. ‘I’ve given it to 10,000 patients and the chances of a second heart attack have been reduced by around 50 per cent.’ The skins of certain red wine grapes, which are used in the fermenting process, are particularly rich in antioxidants. One . antioxidant called resveratrol is particularly good at mopping up . chemicals responsible for causing blood clots, the primary cause of . heart disease. This prevents clots from developing inside the arteries, raising levels of good cholesterol and causing the arteries to dilate. Dr . McCrea recommends young red wines with the highest antioxidant . concentrations, which tend to come from high altitudes. However white . wine does not have the same benefit as the healthy chemicals found in . the grape skins are discarded during its manufacture. Speaking . from his home in Swindon, he said: ‘Initially people tend to be a bit . surprised by my approach. But I find that quite apart from the medicinal . effects, the wine is a good distraction. ‘When . somebody has a heart attack it’s a shock, people are alarmed and . anxious so the red wine also helps to relax them and reduce stress.’","Dr William McCrea, 58, even hands out glasses of wine on his ward rounds .

"The government is pressing YouTube to take down extremist videos used to recruit young Britons to fight in Syria and Iraq. It follows outrage that a shocking jihadi film featuring British student Nasser Muthana was still available on the site. David Cameron insisted he was determined to drive out the 'extremist, poisonous narrative' wherever it appears as Downing Street said it was determined to ensure there 'is not material online promoting terrorist activity'. Scroll down for video . Recruitment video: Reyaad Khan, Nasser Muthana and another Briton in Syria . The shocking jihadi recruitment video was still on YouTube last night .

Mr Cameron regards the hosting of terror films and material online as inappropriate and the authorities are in talks to ensure it is . removed. The government has stepped up efforts to monitor Britons who have traveled to Syria and Iraq to fight, amid warnings the security services are unable to monitor all of those who return. Speaking in Manchester today, Mr Cameron said: 'This is a big threat to our . country as I have repeatedly set out. Prime Minister David Cameron, on a visit to Manchester today, said he would drive out the 'extremist, poisonous narrative' wherever it was found . 'That's why we are putting more of . our resources in terms of intelligence, security, policing, into . stopping people to travel to Syria, monitoring them properly when they . return and making sure we reduce the risk to our country.

Schoolboy to jihadist: Reyaad Khan, now 20, is pictured at school with friends in Cardiff in 2010. He has now travelled to the Middle East to fight alongside Islamist militants . ISIS has deployed a sophisticated social media strategy to promote jihad through YouTube and other sites. Since its military offensive began on June 9, a string of Twitter accounts claiming to represent the group in Iraq and Syria have been active in providing live updates on the group’s operations and images illustrating their advances. Although the accounts have not been officially endorsed by ISIS, they have been widely promoted as official regional accounts by the group’s many online supporters, issuing photos and statements to highlight its military strength and territorial advances in Iraq. Mohammed Hadi, of Coventry, is now 18 . On June 15, images were uploaded of what appeared to be dozens of captured Iraqi security personnel along with threats and messages to surrounding towns warning residents of the group’s approach. The photos included the apparent capture, transport and ultimate killing of the soldiers. The material went viral on the internet and was widely shared by ISIS supporters. In its Twitter feed, ISIS gives extensive details of its operations, including the number of bombings, suicide missions and assassinations it has carried out and the names of checkpoints and towns it controls. The group also produces professional promotional videos and urges support for its ‘one billion campaign’, which calls on Muslims to post messages, photos and videos of support on Twitter, Instagram and YouTube. In an attempt to limit the impact of ISIS’s social media campaign, the Iraqi government has blocked Facebook, Twitter and other platforms. Twitter has also taken some steps to suspend accounts including an ISIS member who tweeted images of an amputation in February. But other accounts quickly spring up. Last night a YouTube spokesman said: ‘YouTube has clear policies prohibiting violent content or content intended to incite violence, and we remove videos violating these policies when flagged by our users. 'We also terminate any account registered by a member of a designated Foreign Terrorist Organisation and used in an official capacity to further its interests. ‘We allow videos posted with a clear news or documentary purpose to remain on YouTube, applying warnings and age-restrictions as appropriate.’ A Twitter spokesman said it did not actively monitor content on the platform but its rules ‘prohibited the publication or posting of direct, specific threats of violence against others or any unlawful use’. He added: ‘We don’t comment on individual accounts.’","Original clip posted on Friday by Isis appears to have been removed .

"A former French intelligence officer who defected to Al Qaeda in Iraq was one of the targets of US air strikes last month, it has been revealed. The unnamed man, said to be one of the highest ranking Western officials to join the terror group, is believed to have survived the attack, which hit eight different locations occupied by the Nursa Front. His identity has been kept a secret with some saying his defection was one of the most dangerous developments in the on-going battle with the militant organization. Scroll down for video . Defection: The French intelligence officer is said to have been one of the targets of airstrikes last month that hit positions occupied by the Nursa Front in  Iraq and Syria. The official has not been identified . According to McClatchy DC he is a former explosives expert with an Arab family and his movements are being closely watched by Western authorities. One European official told the site that they had tried to take the defected official out with a strike rather than capture him because of the desire to keep his existence a secret. The aerial bombardments by the US and its allies focused on the Khorosan group, a unit said to be planning an imminent attack on the West, but Islamic State positions were also hit. The only member of the Khorosan group who has been named and identified as a target in the strikes is Mushin Al Fadhl who was killed. He was named as the leader of the Al Qaeda-affiliated cell - a radical terror collective specializing in intercepting Western jihadists on their arrival in Syria, and training them to carry out deadly bomb attacks on targets in their home nations. Two intelligence sources told McClatchy that the defected official had either left the French military intelligence or France's foreign intelligence agency, the General Directorate for External Security, (DGSE). He is also believed to have fought in Afghanistan and in Syria with Al Qaeda where he is said to have assembled a group of about five men that was operating out of a mosque in Idlib. Miltants: The only member of the Al Qaeda-affiliated Khorosan group who has been named and identified as a target in the strikes is Mushin Al Fadhl (right) who was killed during the attack . Aftermath: Residents in Kfredrian, Idlib, Iraq, inspect the damage caused by what is believed to have been one of the US airstrikes on the area . The French operative is believed to be 'still alive and kicking' after the airstrikes, said one European intelligence official, who described him as 'highly trained in Western intelligence trade-craft and explosives.' They added that they are unsure whether he was a 'sleeper' agent or was radicalized during his time in the service. However they said it was an embarrassing situation for the French. 'It sounds likely he started as French military and maybe because of an Arabic family background and appearance, language skills and a high degree of competency, he would then be loaned out to different aspects of the French services,' one European official told the site. Another said the situation represents an 'epic nightmare that we have so far been spared'. Aerial: The multiple waves of strikes have hit many high profile targets including the Jeribe Oil Refinery in Syria . Attack: The aerial bombardments by the US and its allies focused mainly on the Khorosan group, a unit said to be planning an imminent attack on the West, but Islamic State positions were also hit . Arsenal: The initial wave of strikes on a number of locations was said to have included 47 cruise missiles . F/A-18E Super Hornets were recently pictured in action as part of the US strikes to degrade and destroy the extremist terrorist group ISIS and their affiliates . The F18s were launched from the aircraft carrier USS George H.W. Bush, which is positioned in the Persian Gulf. They were taken this weekend as the US unleashed a wave of fresh attacks in Syria and Iraq, destroying ISIS tanks, armoured vehicles and mortar teams. The destruction of IS targets in Syria and Iraq aims to limit the terrorist's group ability to lead, control and conduct operations. Destruction: An area US officials say was an ISIL vehicle staging center near Abu Kamal, Syria, is seen before (inset) and after it was struck . Bahrain, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates have joined the US in participating in the airstrikes against ISIS. Although the RAF has started bombing targets in Iraq, the Prime Minister has ruled out sending ground troops. The US launched air strikes in Iraq in August and Syria, in September. IS has declared a so-called caliphate in the areas it has taken, and is also holding a number of hostages. Although currently limited to Iraq and Syria, IS has promised to 'break the borders' of Jordan and Lebanon and to 'free Palestine'.

"Clergy who support or join the British National Party or National Front will face disciplinary proceedings under a new resolution passed by the Church of England. Church of England bishops have backed a declaration stating that the policies, activities and objectives of the two far-right parties are 'incompatible' with Christian teaching on racial equality. The move means that a complaint of misconduct can be brought under the Clergy Discipline Measure against any cleric who is a member of, promotes or expresses support for the two parties. The General Synod, or national assembly of the Church of England, will have an opportunity to debate and give formal approval to the declaration when it meets in York next month. If there is no debate, the declaration will automatically come into force at the start of the meeting. Members of the General Synod of the Church of England are set to approve a proposal that will mean clergy who support or join the British National Party or National Front will face disciplinary proceedings . The effective proscribing by the bishops of the two political parties comes after the General Synod gave final approval in 2012 to legislation making it 'unbecoming' or 'inappropriate' conduct for clergy to be members of a political party with policies and activities declared “incompatible” with Church teaching on race equality. The Church of England bishops were given the power to make a declaration on parties or organisations deemed incompatible with Christian teaching. Where a political party is deemed to have changed its views, the ban could be lifted by a simple majority vote by the bishops. The move was first proposed by Vasantha Gnanadoss, a Metropolitan Police civilian worker and General Synod member. She had the backing of the former Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Ian Blair. The BNP, headed by Nick Griffin, claims it is 'modern, forward-thinking and progressive' The British National Party, speaking at the time the move was given final approval by the General Synod, accused the Church of England of being 'stuck in the 1970s'. 'We are a modern, forward-thinking and progressive nationalist party,' a spokesman said. 'We are non-discriminatory and we have a constitution to match.' He added: 'It is high time that was put out there. The Church of England has to keep up to date - they are stuck in the 1970s.' A BNP spokesman said today: 'This is indicative of the way that the Church of England is being politicised. What is written in the Bible and scripture is clearly of secondary importance to the politically-correct option that these people adhere to. 'Where is it going to end? Are BNP members going to be allowed to be buried any more in churches? Is that where it is going to end? It makes you wonder. It is very sad to see the Church go along with this.'","Policies of organisations are 'incompatible' with core Christian values .

"The Archbishop of Canterbury today urged Christians around the world to pray for the terrorists who brutally killed at least 67 in Nairobi. Justin Welby told worshippers not to forget 'the captors' in their prayers, so they can see that violence 'won't have the last word'. He revealed that he himself had prayed for both the gunmen and the victims, and said that to do so was in line with Jesus Christ's teachings. Hands together and eyes closed: Justin Welby urged worshippers not to forget 'the captors' in their prayers . Ten Britons are now feared to be among the victims of Saturday's horrific attack on the upmarket shopping mall in the Kenyan capital. Interviewed on BBC Radio 4's World At One, the Archbishop said: 'As Christians one of the things is that we pray for justice and particularly the issues around the anger that comes when this kind of thing happens, but we are also called as Jesus did on the Cross to pray for those who are doing us harm.' His comments came two days after he had written on his blog that he had prayed for the gunmen. 'I am praying today for all those who remain hostage in a shopping mall in Nairobi, as well as for their families and friends waiting anxiously for news,' he wrote. 'I'm praying too for their captors, that they would see and understand that hostility and violence will never be allowed to have the last word.' Terrorist attack: Smoke rises from the Westgate shopping centre in Nairobi, Kenya. Gunshots rang out from the upscale mall this morning, the day after the president declared an end to a four-day siege by Islamic militants .

'We are called as Jesus did on the Cross to pray for those who are doing us harm' Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury . At least 80 people were killed in the double suicide bombing at the All Saints church in Peshawar as worshippers were leaving Sunday Mass. The Archbishop, who heads up the worldwide Anglican communion, said the victims of the 'appalling' attack had been targeted because of their faith, and called on the Pakistan government to do more to protect all its citizens. 'I think Christians have been attacked in some cases simply because of their faith,' he said. 'I think it is true to say in All Saints Peshawar that we have seen more than 80 martyrs in the last few days. 'They have been attacked because they were testifying to their faith in Jesus Christ by going to church and that is outside any acceptable expression in any circumstances for any reason of religious differences.'","Justin Welby reveals he has prayed for both the gunmen and victims .

"Killing machine: A guillotine used by the Nazis to execute opponents of the Third Reich has been found in the basement of a museum . The guillotine used to behead one of Adolf Hitler’s youngest and bravest opponents has been found in the basement of a museum. The discovery has triggered a debate about whether it should now go on show in tribute to Sophie Scholl, 21, her brother Hans and other members of the White Rose resistance group. After Hitler rose to power he decreed that so-called traitors and other opponents of his regime should be executed and ordered the construction of 20 guillotines, more usually associated with revolutionary era France. The device used to kill the Scholls was found in the basement of  the Bavarian National Museum  in Munich. Back in 1943 Sophie and Hans, 24, were distributing anti-war leaflets at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich when they were caught by the custodian, Jakob Schmid, who informed the Gestapo. The leaflets told the truth about Nazi atrocities in Russia and the stunning defeat at Stalingrad for the German Sixth Army the previous month. On February 22, a Nazi judge sentenced Sophie and Hans to death for treason and they were beheaded the same day in Stadelheim prison. Three other White Rose members were also executed. Gestapo interrogators had offered Sophie the chance of survival if she blamed the leaflets entirely on her brother and other White Rose members, but she refused. Since then numerous books have been written about them and thousands of streets and squares in modern-day Germany are named after them. But now comes the difficult issue of what to do with the guillotine that ended their lives now it has resurfaced. Victims: (left to right) Hans Scholl,  Sophie Scholl and Christoph Probst, all members of the German anti-nazi resistance movement The White Rose. They were all executed in 1943 . Brave: Sophie was only 21 when she and her brother faced the guillotine in 1943 . A museum spokesman said the machine had been locked away decades ago because it was deemed too macabre to put on display. Hildegard . Kronawitter, chairman of the White Rose Foundation which perpetuates . the memory of the Scholls, said the guillotine should form the . centrepiece of a new exhibition honouring their resistance. ‘You . cannot lock away such an artefact and pretend that it doesn’t exist,’ she said. ‘It must be presented to the public in its historical . context.’ But Franz Josef . Mueller, who at 89 is the last surviving member of the White Rose group, . said: ‘No, this should not go on display. ‘No . entertainment must be made of their violent deaths. 'The memory of . Sophie and Hans is deep within me. I think of them every day.’ Bavaria’s . arts minister Ludwig Spaenle said: ‘One must proceed with great . sensitivity and reverence. One cannot decide what to do with this . overnight.’ Honour: Sophie Scholl (by the fence) and other members of the White Rose. Scholars are now debating whether the machine should be displayed in the two's honour .","Machine found in basement of the Bavarian National Museum, Munich .

"Mannequins in fashion boutiques are now being fitted with secret cameras to 'spy' on shoppers' buying habits. High Street fashion chains have deployed the dummies equipped with technology adapted from security systems used to identify criminals at airports. From the outside, the $3,200 (£2,009) EyeSee dummy looks like any other mannequin, but behind its blank gaze it hides a camera feeding images into facial recognition software that logs the age, gender and race of shoppers. Scroll down for video . 'Creepy': The EyeSee mannequin, which has a . camera hidden behind its eye to track shoppers' behaviour as they . browse fashion boutiques to allow retailers to collect information on their customers . This information is fed into a computer and is 'aggregated' to offer retailers using the system statistical and contextual information they can use to develop their marketing strategies. Its makers boast: 'From now on you can know how many people enter the store, record what time there is a greater influx of customers (and which type) and see if some areas risk to be overcrowded. However, privacy campaigners have denounced the system as 'creepy' and said that such surveillance is an instance of profit trumping privacy. The device is marketed by Italian mannequin maker Almax and has already spurred shops into adjusting window displays, floor layours and promotions, Bloomberg reported. With growth slowing in the luxury goods industry, the technology taps into retailers' desperation to personalise their offers to reach increasingly picky customers. Staring back: The mannequins have a video camera hidden behind one eye which is connected to facial recognition software that logs the age, gender and race of shoppers as they walk by . Although video profiling of customers . is not new, Almax claims its offering is better at providing data . because it stands at eye level with customers, who are more likely to . look directly at the mannequins. The video surveillance mannequins have . been on sale for almost a year, and are already being used in three . European countries and in the U.S. Almax claims information from the . devices led one outlet to adjust window displays after they found that . men shopping in the first two days of a sale spent more than women, . while another introduced a children's line after the dummy showed . youngsters made up more than half its afternoon traffic. A . third retailer placed Chinese-speaking staff by a particular entrance . after it found a third of visitors using that door after 4pm were Asian. If mannequins that stare back at you as you shop wasn't creepy enough, there were today also warnings that fully autonomous robots that decide for themselves when to kill could be developed within 20 to 30 years - or 'even sooner'. Militaries across the world are said to be 'very excited' about machines that could deployed alone in battle, sparing human troops from dangerous situations. The warnings come from a new report by Human Rights Watch, which insists that such Terminator-style robots are banned before governments start deploying them. Calling them 'killer robots,' it urges 'an international treaty that would absolutely prohibit the development, production, and use of fully autonomous weapons.' Almax chief executive Max Catanese refused to name which retailers were using the new technology, telling Bloomberg that confidentiality agreements meant he could not disclose the names of clients. But he did reveal that five companies - among them leading fashion brands - are using 'a few dozen' of the mannequins, with orders for at least that many more. Almax is now hoping to update the . technology to allow the mannequins - and by extension the retailers who . operate them - to listen in on what customers are saying about the . clothes on display. Mr . Catanese told Bloomberg the company also plans to add screens next to . the dummies to prompt passers-by about products that fit their profile, . similar to the way online retailers use cookies to personalise web . browsing. Almax insists that its system does . not invade the privacy of shoppers since the camera inside the mannequin . is 'blind', meaning that it does not record the images of passers-by, . instead merely collecting data about them. In an emailed statement, Mr Catanese . told MailOnline: 'Let’s say I pass in front of the mannequin. Nobody . will know that “Max Catanese” passed in front of it. 'The retailer will have the . information that a male adult Caucasian passed in front of the mannequin . at 6:25pm and spent 3 minutes in front of it. No sensible/private data, . nor image is collected. 'Different is the case if a place . (shop, department store, etc.) is already covered by security cameras . (by the way, basically almost every retailer in the world today). 'In those cases we could even provide . the regular camera as the data and customers images are already . collected in the store which are authorised to do so. 'In any case, just to avoid questions, so far we only offer the version with blind camera.' Marketing tool: The Italian company behind the EyeSee system claims several retailers have already have already used the information it provides to inform their marketing strategies . Nevertheless, privacy groups are concerned about the roll-out of the technology. Emma Carr, deputy director of civil liberties campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: 'Keeping cameras hidden in a mannequin is nothing short of creepy. 'The use of covert surveillance technology by shops, in order to provide a personalised service, seems totally disproportionate. 'The fact that the cameras are hidden suggests that shops are fully aware that many customers would object to this kind of monitoring. 'It is not only essential that customers are fully informed that they are being watched, but that they also have real choice of service and on what terms it is offered. 'Without this transparency, shops cannot be completely sure that their customers even want this level of personalised service. 'This is another example of how the public are increasingly being monitored by retailers without ever being asked for their permission. Profit trumps privacy yet again.'","Mannequins have cameras instead of eyes to monitor people as they shop .

"Archaeologists have uncovered grim evidence of a centuries-old mass grave next to Durham Cathedral. Experts from Durham University carrying out digs on the city’s World Heritage Site have discovered the remains of many more human bodies. Digs earlier this month found four bodies - a figure which has now risen to 18. Newly discovered human remains at the Durham site brings the total of skeletons found to 18 individuals. At first archaeologists believed the remains were overflow from the cathedral's cemetery, but the way the bodies were arranged reveals an unusual form of burial . The team members first thought they had uncovered remains of Durham Cathedral’s medieval cemetery, the boundaries of which may have extended further than the present day burial site. But the newly-discovered corpses had been tipped into the earth without elaborate ceremony, suggesting they part of a mass burial. Richard Annis, senior archaeologist with Archaeological Services Durham University, said: 'We have found clear evidence of a mass burial and not a normal group of graves. 'One of the densest areas of the excavation was further north, which is further away from the edge of the presumed graveyard. Durham University will carry out further research into the remains, which will include dating the bones and looking for clues as to their origin. This work is expected to begin in the New Year (archaeologist Janet Beveridge, pictured) Richard Annis, senior archaeologist with Archaeological Services Durham University, said: 'The bodies have been tipped into the earth without elaborate ceremony and they are tightly packed together and jumbled' 'The bodies have been tipped into the earth without elaborate ceremony and they are tightly packed together and jumbled. Archaeologists working on the dig (pictured) said that no definitive interpretation of the grave could be offered at this stage . 'Some are buried in a North-to-South alignment, rather than the traditional East-to-West alignment that we would expect from a conventional medieval burial site.' The same Durham University team will carry out further research into the remains, which will include dating the bones and looking for clues as to their origin. This work is expected to begin in the New Year. Mr Annis added that no definitive interpretation could be offered at this stage in the investigation. He said: 'The process of post-excavation processing, examination and analysis is essential to allow us to draw proper conclusions about this group of human remains. 'It is too early to say what they may be.' The first evidence of human remains was found earlier in November during building work at the University’s Palace Green Library. With the necessary permission from the UK’s Ministry of Justice, archaeologists are carrying out excavation works in the area before taking the bones away for further examination. By law, the bones must eventually be reinterred at an approved burial ground. Palace Green Library is undergoing a £10m development to establish world-class exhibition and visitor facilities, part of a £30m total investment in Durham University library services.","Digs earlier this month found 4 bodies - a figure which has now risen to 18 .

"Enjoying the perfect glass of wine doesn't require you to shell out a lot of money on the most expensive bottle you can find. Instead, the results of the world's largest multisensory wine experiment reveal that a simple change in colour and sound can affect the taste of wine by nearly 10 per cent. Listening to supposedly 'sweet' and 'sour' music in a room with red or green lighting can significantly alter the taste of a glass of wine, according to the research. An experiment at London's Southbank Centre (pictured) tested how drinkers enjoyed a glass of wine when lighting and music were changed. Red light and 'sweet' music was the ideal combination, increasing enjoyment of wine by as much as nine per cent . The full findings, which have been . submitted to a scientific journal for publication, suggest red light and . 'sweet' music is the ideal combination, increasing enjoyment by as much . as nine per cent. If you prefer fruity wine, swap in a red light bulb to a side lamp to create warmer lighting tones. If you like a fresh, zingy wine, then try green table settings or glasses instead. Music has a profound effect on taste too. Play sweet music with red lighting in the background, such as Trois Gymnopédies, No.2 Lent et triste to increase the intensity of your wine, or green lighting with sour music such as Superscriptio to make it taste even fresher. If you want to recreate the experiments at home, you can listen to the tracks used in the Colour Lab experiment at https://soundcloud.com/crossmodal/sets/tastemusic . Green light and 'sour' music increased freshness and reduced intensity by 14 per cent. ‘It’s the same as someone moving from . being ambivalent about the taste of something to really liking it,' said Professor of Experimental Psychology at Oxford University Charles Spence. 'And, . with this experiment, that shift happened in seconds.' The music choices were selected from previous studies which found certain tempos and instruments made food taste sweeter or more sour. Sweet sounds are flowing and legato, soft and highly consonant, while sour sounds are more choppy and staccato, sharp and moderately consonant. Sweet music used in the experiment included Trois Gymnopédies, No.2 Lent et triste by Erik Satie. An example of a sour song meanwhile was Superscriptio by Brian Ferneyhough. Red lighting on its own brought out the fruitier notes of the wine, and green light on its own brought out the wine’s freshness. Glass of wine at the ready? Listening to Erik Satie's Gymnopedie No. 2 above while in a room with red lighting should make wine taste sweeter and increase your enjoyment by as much as nine per cent . If you're after a more sour taste to your wine then listen to Italian flutist Roberto Fabbriciani's version of Superscriptio by Brian Ferneyhough above while in a room with green lighting . The study was undertaken by Campo Viejo, a company that makes wine in Spain's Rioja region, and Professor Spence of Oxford University. Green light (pictured) and 'sour' music increased freshness and reduced intensity by 14 per cent and significantly altered the taster's enjoyment . If people can't change the paint or light in a room, the study claims a change in dinner place settings can have a similar effect. People who prefer a fruity wine, and want to enhance its flavour, can try laying a red tablecloth or use red wine glasses. For fresh wine, go for green table . settings or green food. Almost 3,000 people took part in the Colour Lab experiment last month. The study was a world first and was undertaken by Campo Viejo, a company that makes wine in Spain’s Rioja region, in partnership with Professor Spence who hosted it as part of the Streets of Spain festival at London’s Southbank Centre. Campo Viejo Colour Lab was a custom-built installation for participants to walk through and experience the influence of colour and sound on taste. Carefully choreographed, each participant on entering was given a single glass of wine to taste whilst being exposed to a selection of scientifically chosen sounds and colours. Commenting on the findings, Professor Spence said: ‘We were astonished to see that colour and sound has such a profound effect on the taste of wine. 'We knew an effect was likely but the results went far beyond what we were hoping for. 'Conducting the world’s largest multisensory experiment, over the four days, meant that we were able to unequivocally show, for the first time, that colour and sound together have a far greater effect on people’s taste perceptions than light by itself.' Campo Viejo Colour Lab was a custom-built installation for participants to walk through and experience the influence of colour and sound on taste. Carefully choreographed, each participant on entering was given a single glass of wine to taste while experiencing light and music . Roberto Vicente, winemaker at Campo Viejo, added: ‘This really is cutting edge stuff. 'Our findings show just how vital it is for bars and restaurants to seriously consider the environments they create for customers; it could have a real impact on business. ‘For wine drinkers at home it is all about injecting colour at every available opportunity. ‘Red can be a bold colour choice for a room but smaller splashes of colour such as a red light bulb in a side lamp to create warmer lighting tones could have a real effect on the enjoyment of wine. ‘If you typically prefer a fruity wine, and want to enhance its flavour, try laying a red tablecloth or use red wine glasses. 'If fresh, ""zingy"" wine is more to your taste, then go for green table settings - really give your dinner guests something to talk about at the table. 'This is a simple way to get colour into your life - and make your wine taste even better in the process.’","Almost 3,000 people took part in the Campo Viejo experiment in London .

"Forget the idea Neanderthals simply picked any old cave to sleep in for the night. Researchers have discovered an elaborate 44,000-year-old Neanderthal house in Molodova, eastern Ukraine, made from mammoth bones, delicately decorated with carvings and pigments. It had been thought Neanderthals, which died out around 30,000 years ago, were primitive nomads who lived in caves simply for shelter. Caveman: Although we traditionally think the Neanderthal as less than homey, new research shows they did settle down in places, even building homes . The latest discovery is believed to be the earliest example of a domestic house built from bone and suggests our ancestors were more homey than previously thought. Researchers from the Muséum National d'Histories Naturelle in Paris said it suggests the early human ancestors settled in areas where they built structures to live for extended periods of time. Laëtitia Demay, an archaeologist who led the research, told The Telegraph: 'This mammoth bone structure could be described as the basement of a wooden cover or as a windscreen. New research: Usually Neanderthals are associated with caves, like Kent's Caven (pictured) where a jaw bone was discovered . 'The use of bones as building elements can be appreciated as anticipation of climatic variations. Under a cold climate in an open environment, the lack of wood led humans to use bones to build protections against the wind.' The circular house was made up of 116 large bones including mammoth skulls, jaws, 14 tusks and leg bones. Home is where the heart is: It seems like the Neanderthal Man, pictured here in the Neanderthal Museum in Mettmann by Duesseldorf, Northrhine-Westphalia, Germany, did like to settle down occasionally . And inside at least 25 hearths filled with ash were also found, suggesting it had been used for some time. It is believed the Neanderthals hunted and killed the mammoths for meat before using their bones but also collected some of the bones from animals that had died of natural causes. Simon Underdown, a senior lecturer in . biological anthropology who researches Neanderthals at Oxford Brookes . University, told The Telegraph 'It's another piece in the newly emerging . Neanderthal jigsaw puzzle. 'Far from being the stupid cavemen of . popular image it's becoming increasingly clear the Neanderthals were a . highly sophisticated species of human. All the research will be published in scientific journal Quaternary International. It adds to the growing view that Neanderthals sophisticated humans who has their own culture and may have even used language to communicate.","Oldest example of domestic 'house' built from bone .

"A prankster is terrifying urban explorers by hiding in an abandoned hospital and creeping up on them. Photographers visiting the dilapidated St Mary's Hospital near Kirkcaldy, Fife, are confronted by Owlman, who stalks the corridors waiting for unsuspecting visitors. The haunting creature is the . creation of filmmaker Lawrie Brewster, who set up seven hidden cameras inside the Victorian building to film the photographers' reactions. Scroll down for video . Terrifying: The Owlman has been creeping around the abandoned St Mary's Hospital near Kirkaldy in Fife, waiting to scare urban explorers . Vicious: A photographer who walked into the dilapidated building looks terrified as he is confronted by the long claws of Owlman . It captured one man was left cowering in the corner of the room after he tried to close the door on the monster. Mr Brewster, 33, from Fife, developed a love of the horrific when he was a child and has had his films screened at . the Sundance Film Festival and South by Southwest (SXSW). He said: 'As a child I loved eerie dramas of the supernatural and classic spine-tingling classics, such as Hammer Horror films like The Devil Rides Out and The Wicker Man. 'The idea to create the Owlman was inspired by a terrifying god in the archives of ancient religion, related to the god Moloch.' Mr Brewster decided to use the Owlman creation as part of a prank which took place inside the abandoned St Mary’s Children’s Hospital. The horrifying Owlman’s head is made of a mixture of papier-mache, wire, and plenty of feathers. Trapped: The man cowers in the corner of the room as the creature encroaches on him . The horrifying Owlman's head is made of a mixture of papier-mache, wire, and plenty of feathers . He says, 'The St Mary’s Children’s Hospital prank was carefully set up over a period of several weeks, where we assessed how often visitors went to the hospital and what times they were most likely to appear. 'Once we were confident that our unfortunate victims were most likely to appear during a certain day and time, we lay in wait. 'We pranked about six people during the day, and the first three reactions were the most dramatic to share. 'Reactions were consistent with fight or flight, people either slamming doors shut, barricading and screaming at the Owlman to leave or escaping out of the hospital at top speed. 'The first reaction is the epitome of all things Scottish and that’s what makes him marvellous. 'The fact that we have an angry bald man shouting furiously is fantastic. Stunt: Filmmaker Lawrie Brewster, 33, who created the character, has set up seven hidden cameras in the hospital corridors to catch peoples' reactions to the creature . 'The second reaction was the most primal and emotional and perhaps expresses the true terror we all hold in the face of the uncanny. 'We had to stop the prank and escort the man from the ruined hospital and share with him some sandwiches and a flask of tea.' St Mary’s Children’s Hospital was a Victorian complex used to treat infectious diseases, and at one time focused its work on scarlet fever. 'This is just the beginning of the Owlman’s terrifying career, and we will see him in a mixture of public interactions and elaborate set ups,' he added. 'I treat these pranks as a work of public theatre - albeit without the public’s forewarning!'","Stunt was set up by Scottish filmmaker Lawrie Brewster in Kirkaldy, Fife .

"It is a meeting which aims to promote everything good about racing in this country with over £4million of prizemoney. But if you are betting, it has not always paid to be patriotic at Qipco British Champions Day at Ascot. The first three years of the end-of-season finale featuring five Group races, has seen over half won by runners from either France or Ireland and there is no sign of the foreign invasion relenting. Cirrus Des Aigles is tipped to repeat 2011 success in the Champion Stakes at Ascot . French warrior Cirrus Des Aigles, the 2011 winner, is favourite win a second Champion Stakes when his main rival could turn out be Free Eagle. An equally potent challenger from across the Channel is Charm Spirit, who can continue the wonderful month for the Head family in the Queen Eliazabeth II Stakes. Two weeks after Criquette Head-Maarek secured a second Prix de L’Arc de Triomphe with Treve, brother Freddie saddles the winner of the Prix du Moulin and Prix Jean Prat insisting his colt is a different proposition to when he was fifth to Richard Hannon’s Night of Thunder in the 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket in May. The pair clash again and Head said: ‘I am very happy with him. The ground will be very testing and it will make it a tough mile but he will cope — he has won on the soft. He is more mature and relaxes which he never did in the Guineas.’ Charm Spirit can continue wonderful month for the Head family in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes . Seventeen Group One winners are due to line up, a decent number to soften the blow of high-profile absentees headed by Kingman and Australia. By the end of the day, we should know whether Richard Hannon, in his first season since taking over from his father, will be champion trainer after his tussle with John Gosden. Hannon leads by £215,000 and could be made to sweat as his rival attacks the Long Distance Cup (Flying Officer and Marzocco) and Champion Sprint (Gregorian) before his first runners — Night of Thunder and Toormore in the QEII Stakes — enter the fray. Gosden also runs Western Hymn in the Champion Stakes, where Hannon saddles Pether’s Moon, worth £770,000 to the winner. Night Of Thunder (above left) and Charm Spirit  will clash again in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes . But the odds are in Hannon’s favour and, if results go his way, he could become the first British trainer to break the £5m barrier for the season. He will hope for better than yesterday at Newmarket’s Future Champions Day when his favourites Ivawood (second in the Middle Park Stakes) and Estidhkaar (fourth in the Dewhurst Stakes) were beaten. Hannon said: ‘We still have air in our lungs and tomorrow might be different.’ It was Andrea Atzeni-ridden Belardo, a third Group One winner of the season for Roger Varian, who emerged on top in the Dewhurst and Charming Thought (William Buick) for Charlie Appleby, who landed the Middle Park. The latter, now 16-1 for the 2,000 Guineas, was a first British Group One in the blue colours of Sheik Mohammed’s Godolphin since Saeed Bin Suroor’s Farhh won the Champion Stakes on today’s card a year ago.","British Champions Day features five Group races at Ascot .

"Holland is on a collision course with the EU over a threat to deport Poles and other Eastern Europeans who cannot find work. Ministers in the Hague also want to withhold migrants’ state benefits if they don’t speak Dutch. Brussels fears that other countries experiencing an influx of jobseekers from member states might be tempted to copy the Netherlands’ threat, even though such a move would breach EU laws. Dutch social affairs minister Henk Kamp (left) believes that Poles who have not been able to find work should be kicked out of the country. Poland's economic affairs minister Waldemar Pawlak (right) said the Dutch plans were 'worrying' Dutch social affairs minister Henk . Kamp has presented proposals to expel Polish and other Eastern European . nationals who are without work for three months and have little prospect . of finding any. He also plans to withhold welfare  benefits from those who have not  learned Dutch. The moves are likely to breach rules protecting freedom of work and movement for people within the EU. Holland has about 200,000 migrant . workers from Eastern Europe. Although this figure is far less than for . some other countries – such as the million-plus who have come to Britain . since Eastern European accession to the EU in 2004 – the number is . growing rapidly. Poland's European affairs minister Mikolaj Dowgielewicz says there have been 'robust talks' with the Netherlands on the plan . Poland’s economic affairs minister . Waldemar Pawlak called the Dutch plans ‘worrying’, adding: ‘This . development is dangerous and could lead to the collapse of the European . system of freedom  of movement.’ Poland’s European affairs minister . Mikolaj Dowgielewicz said there have been ‘robust talks’ with the . Netherlands on the proposals. Poland took over the presidency of the EU last Friday for the next six months. Europe’s justice commissioner Viviane . Reding has warned the Netherlands that it ‘must respect EU rules on the . freedom of movement between member states’. If the Netherlands fails to . comply with EU legislation, the commission will make its position ‘loud . and clear’, she said. ‘All member states are equal and the rules are . transparent,’ she added. All people within the EU have a right . to freedom of movement and work as long as they are either working or . are self-sufficient in funding. The accession countries partially . enjoyed these rights after 2004, and have fully done so since the end of . the ‘transition’ period in May this year. This means it is likely to be illegal . for Holland to carry out the proposals, particularly those which relate . to language requirements. While countries like Britain have . rigidly stuck to EU laws and directives, other nations have been less . circumspect on doing so, and in many cases go unpunished. A Polish woman is shown picking strawberries in Holland. The number of Poles in The Netherlands has increased tenfold in four years . Other than receiving a rebuke from . the European Commission, they could eventually be dragged through the . European Court of Justice in Luxembourg – which could take many years. Poland’s ambassador to the Netherlands said recent anti-Polish statements by politicians there ‘border on discrimination’. There is a growing discontent with . labour migrants in the Netherlands, where  Poles are accused misusing . the social  benefit system. In 2007 there were 20,000 Poles . there, now there are close to 200,000, according to figures from the . Polish Embassy in the country. The rise has prompted a number of . factories in the Netherlands to use Polish to communicate, with signs . written in the language as well as the hiring of Polish managerial . staff.","Migrants out of work for three months 'should be kicked out of the country'

"Footballer Ben Hayes, 18, has been jailed for four and a half years for killing a teenage peacemaker with a single punch in a post-party brawl . A trainee professional footballer who killed a peacemaker with a single punch when a drug-fuelled 16th birthday party ended in violence was jailed for four and a half years today. Footballer Ben Hayes, 18, swung at trainee electrician George Verrier when he tried to stop a street brawl at the end of dancer Madison Moran’s celebrations. Mr Verrier, 17, was able to walk away from the attack, but was found unconscious at a friend's house the following morning with severe bleeding on his brain, and died just hours later. Police told him he needed to go to hospital, but refused to take him, with friends adding that officers told him to 'get a bus'. Hayes was convicted  of manslaughter at the Old Bailey and sentenced to four and a half years imprisonment in a young offender’s institute. The victim’s family wept in court as sentence was passed. In a statement read to the court, mother Laura Verrier described her son as a ‘healthy, funny and intelligent young man’ who ‘had his whole life ahead of him’. She said: ‘The only comfort, if any, is that through George’s selflessness, he had completed an organ donor card, three people have been given a second chance at life.’ As Hayes was led away to the cells a man, who identified himself as the defendant’s brother, shouted obscenities from the public gallery about the judge and police before he was escorted out by security staff. Judge Anthony Bate told Hayes: ‘You punched George because he got in your way. ‘A substantial term of imprisonment is inevitable for this grave offence. ‘The length of the punishment now imposed in no way equates to the enduring and profound loss felt by George’s family. ‘A healthy and intelligent young man had a promising future taken when you lashed out at him in a moment of hot temper.’ George Verrier, 17, was described by his mother as a 'healthy, funny and intelligent young man’ who ‘had his whole life ahead of him’ He continued: 'It’s plain that shortly before the killing your friends had twice tried to calm you down. ‘You remained angry, upset and pumped-up. ‘George intervened as a peacemaker and you struck him to the face. ‘He fell heavily and struck the right side of his head on the ground.’ Stephen Kamlish QC, defending Hayes, said in mitigation that he had a bright future ahead of him. ‘His football career has been cut short, he was on a list to go to the US for a year of scholarship at a sports university,’ he said. Hayes and Mr Verrier had been among the guests at Brit School pupil Ms Moran’s party, thrown by her parents at their £500,000 home in Bromley. The bash for the teenager, a trainee dancer at the prestigious arts school attended by Adele, Jessie J, and Amy Winehouse, was said to be well-organised, with bouncers on the door and wristbands for all guests. Dancer Madison Moran, whose 16th birthday party ended in a brawl which resulted in the death of guest George Verrier, with residents nearby complaining of fighting and debauchery . However, Mr Kamlish said drug dealers were offering a rash of illegal drugs to the largely teenage guests. ‘The jury will hear drugs were being offered - ecstasy, cocaine, ketamine, and cannabis,' he said. ‘It was not just one person, but people were going around whispering ""can I sell you something?"".’ Violence flared up when the party ended at 12.30am, as hoards of partygoers flooded out on to the quiet residential street. ‘A number of local residents called the police, complaining about disorderly behaviour and fights involving large groups of youths’, said prosecutor Zoe Johnson QC. She said one resident, Carly Mairs, saw up to 20 teenagers punching and shoving each other in the street, while another, Andy Finney, reported ‘fighting and general debauchery’. ‘He told the police he had seen six to eight lads kicking cars and fences, and urinating in the street’, she said. ‘He also observed couples having sex in full view, and he described being intimidated by the size and nature of the group.’ The Bromley house where the party had been, before violence spilled out into the quiet residential street . Hayes attacked Mr Verrier at around 1am, after chasing him down the street with a pack of other boys. Max Kane, a pupil at The Ravensbourne School in Bromley, said Verrier was trying to break up a fight in the street when he was attacked. ‘George was absolutely no threat to Ben Hayes’, he told the court. ‘Ben looked angry, he looked like a ball of anger, like he wanted to explode and switch at someone. ‘He looked like he was there for a fight. ‘He punched him round the side of the face, in between the jaw and the chin as I remember it. ‘As George was hit, the momentum with which the punch hit him spun him round towards me. ‘I remember seeing his face as he fell to the floor. ‘It looked like the life had been sucked out of him.’ Mr Kane said the trouble began when one of his friends was headbutted by another teenager. He said a large group ‘swarmed’ up the street as arguments raged between the teenagers, and some started to chase one of his friends up the road. Mr Verrier was able to walk away from the attack, but was found unconscious at a friend's house the following morning with severe bleeding on his brain, and died just hours later . Mr Kane said he went to protect the friend, and was punched in the face himself, just before Mr Verrier was attacked. ‘George was standing opposite him, still telling him to calm down’, he said. ‘They were both shouting at each other but George was shouting at Ben to calm down and to leave it.’ He said Hayes landed the punch out of nowhere, then left the scene when a police van called to the earlier disturbances arrived. ‘As soon as Ben Hayes saw the police van, he ran down the road’, he said. ‘I’ve never seen someone running so fast in my life. ‘George Verrier was bleeding from the nose and the mouth. ‘I remember thinking to myself I thought he actually looked dead.’ Hayes was arrested shortly after the attack, in Southborough Street, on September 1 last year. ‘There are no winners in this case’, said Ms Johnson. ‘Both the defendant and the deceased were young men with their whole lives in front of them.’ Hayes argued he was acting in self-defence when he punched Mr Verrier. Hayes, of Constable Mews, Bromley, denied but was convicted of manslaughter.","Trainee professional footballer Ben Hayes killed trainee electrician George Verrier .

"They say that love knows no bounds, and these two dogs are certainly proof of that. West Highland terrier Joey has cross-bred with a female Rottweiler double his size to father a litter of 11 puppies, which have been given the name 'Wotties'. The owner of both the dogs, Teresa Patterson, from North Grimston, Yorkshire, was surprised they had mated and was unaware it had taken place until the puppies were born. Rottweiler Zara, right, and white West Highland terrier, Joey, mated to create a 'Wottie' cross-breed . Owner Teresa Patterson, from North Grimston, Yorkshire, was surprised the dogs had mated and was unaware it had taken place until the puppies were born . While so-called ‘Wotties’ are a rare, possibly unique, cross-breed, it is not uncommon for other breeds of dogs to mate and create attractive and fashionable crosses. The Poodle is a particularly popular dog to cross breed. Cockapoos, mixed with Cocker Spaniels, Labradoodles, mixed with Labradors, and Maltipoos, mixed with Maltese dogs, are some of the most common cross-breeds. Poodles also cross with Golden Retrievers and Yorkshire terriers to make Goldendoodles and Yorkipoos respectively. Other common crosses include the Puggle, a cross between a Pug and a Beagle, and the Goldador, which is a mix of the golden retriever and the Labrador retriever. After the litter arrived in the summer four-year-old mother Zara lost interest, leaving Joey, one, to take care of them. Sadly, four of the puppies died and Ms Patterson was forced to step in when Zara refused to feed. She fed the seven remaining animals Weetabix and scrambled egg to keep them strong, and even gave them Horlicks to help them sleep. But, with Zara seemingly not interested, the owner was forced to put out an appeal for homes for the 'attention-seeking' youngsters via the charity, Yorkshire Coast Dog Rescue in Scarborough. Ms Patterson's sons, Jonathan and Matthew, have now taken one each from the litter and the remaining five have found new homes. Ms Patterson, 50, an administrative . clerk, said: ‘We got Joey in May and it must have happened straight away . but we didn't think it would have been possible. ‘Zara didn't know what to do and I just started screaming when the puppies started popping out… . Ms Patterson had to feed the puppies Weetabix and scrambled eggs when Zara (left) refused to feed them . Zara, four, gave birth to a litter of 11 puppies in the summer, but left Joey, one, to take care of them . ‘I was completely shocked, I didn't think nature would let this happen but at some point it did. ‘The puppies have a lovely temperament like their parents. They are high maintenance as they want attention all the time. 'One of the puppies, Sparkie, which our son is having, follows me everywhere I go.’ She added: ‘But this won't happen again - Joey will be going to the vets soon.’ Sadly, four of the puppies died and Ms Patterson was forced to step in when Zara refused to feed . Ms Patterson has ruled out a repeat incident, saying she will now be taking one-year-old Joey to the vets . Victoria Lowe, from Scarborough, took one of the puppies, now called Lola, when it was ten weeks old. She said: ‘Everyone we meet is fascinated by Lola and it is all a bit of a mystery as to how big she will grow. ‘She is so full of character and gets up to all kinds of mischief.’ The Kennel Club, which each year registers around 250,000 puppies across 212 breeds, said it had never come across a 'Wottie' cross-breed. A spokesman said: ‘We can never say it has never happened but this is the first time we've come across it.’ Ms Patterson (right) brought Joey into her home in May, and Zara gave birth to the litter of 11 puppies in July .","West Highland terrier, Joey, mated with Rottweiler Zara shortly after entering family home this summer .

The last column removed from ground zero is covered with missing-person posters and memorial inscriptions by ironworkers and rescue personnel. Rescue workers: Relatives of the victims and emergency responders will never be charged an entrance fee to the site, which also contains the unidentified remains . Difficult exit: A New York Fire Department ambulance that never made it out of the melee is part of the museum collection . Fire resistant: In addition to the relatives of the fallen, emergency responders are allowed to visit the memorial over the course of the next six days before it is opened to the public . Dealing on a deadline: Firefighters and EMTs were not the only rescue workers who died on that fateful day, as police officers were also among the casualties . Eerily preserved: Dust and ash is shown on the display that made up the front window of Chelsea Jeans, a store that was located on Broadway near Fulton Street at the time of the attack and has since been moved into the museum . From the planes: A laptop used by terrorist . Ramzi Yousef who was convicted of the 1993 bombing of the World Trade . Center is on display along with his mugshot (left) as is a window from . one of the planes that crashed into the towers . The museum faced financing squabbles and construction challenges. Conflicts . over its content underlined the sensitivity of memorializing the dead . while honoring survivors and rescuers, of balancing the intimate with . the international. The museum harbors both personal possessions and artifacts that became public symbols of survival and loss. One . of the more controversial inclusions is the cross-shaped steel beam . that became an emblem of remembrance. (An atheists' group has sued, so . far unsuccessfully, seeking to stop the display of the cross). Sending out a signal: This 19.8-foot fragment of the once 360-foot transmission that stood atop the tower shows how dramatically everything was broken apart . Charred: Thousands of artifacts, like this payphone, were stored for more than a decade before being moved to the museum . Interactive: An animation at left shows the path that the terrorists took on that fateful morning, while pieces of steel from the impact floors on the 96th to 99th floor (right) are shown directly above the visitors' heads . Preview: The exhibit is meant to give a sense of the lead up to the attack and the aftermath as well as a minute-by-minute account of what happened . Portraits and profiles describe the nearly 3,000 people killed by the September 11 attacks and the 1993 trade center bombing. Nearly 2,000 oral histories give voice to the memories of survivors, first responders, victims' relatives and others. In . one, a mother remembers a birthday dinner at the trade center's Windows . on the World restaurant the night before her daughter died at work at . the towers. The museum also looks at the lead-up to September 11 and its legacy. Members . of the museum's interfaith clergy advisory panel raised concerns that . it plans to show a documentary film, about al Qaeda, that they said . unfairly links Islam and terrorism. The museum has said the documentary . is objective and its scholarship solid. Iconic images: The clouds of smoke (seen in a photograph at left) and the parallel bars of the building frame (at right) were among the most iconic references to the tragedy . Heartbreaking: The notes left by first responders on the remaining beams are among the most moving . Tributes: Photos and personal stories memorialize the thousands of victims who died in the terrorist attacks . Personal efforts: Quilts (pictured) and other objects made as memorials by New Yorkers are included in the exhibit, which will cost $24 for members of the public to visit . Using every piece: The letters in this Virgil quotation were forged out of steel from the Towers . While some September 11 victims' relatives have embraced the museum, others have denounced its $24 general-public ticket price as unseemly and its underground location as disrespectful, particularly because unidentified remains are being stored in a private repository there. Other victims' families see it as a fitting resting place. The museum and the memorial plaza above it cost a total of $700million to build. They will cost $60million a year to run, more than Arlington National Cemetery and more than 15 times as much as the museum that memorializes the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. September 11 museum organizers have noted that security alone costs about $10 million a year.

"Tory MP John Hayes was fired as Energy Minister for secretly plotting to persuade E.on to warn of blackouts . Tory MP John Hayes was fired as Energy Minister for secretly plotting to persuade an electricity boss to challenge Government policy. Climate change sceptic Mr Hayes had asked the head of power giants  E.on to warn of blackouts unless the Coalition watered down its green crusade and made a U-turn on the closure of coal-fired generators. But Mr Hayes’s boss, Energy Secretary Ed Davey, hit the roof when he found out about the ‘treachery’ – and demanded he was sacked. Two weeks later, Mr Hayes was dismissed and given a minor backroom role in No 10, advising David Cameron on links with Tory MPs. But his dire warnings about energy shortages were later vindicated by regulator Ofgem, which warned of an even bigger risk of power cuts. The feud was kept secret by Downing Street to avoid exposing Coalition tensions over climate change and Europe. An EU directive to encourage ‘cleaner’ energy is behind the closure of coal-fired stations. At the time of Mr Hayes’s sacking, both Mr Cameron and Lib Dem Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg denied he had been forced out, or that there was a row with Mr Davey. But The Mail on Sunday has established that he was demoted after he secretly met E.on chief executive Tony Cocker on March 13 and urged him to help postpone the closure of power stations such as Kingsnorth in Kent. Mr Hayes's boss, Energy Secretary Ed Davey, hit the roof when he found out about the 'treachery' ¿ and demanded he was sacked . The meeting came after Mr Davey had rejected pleas by Mr Hayes to use the UK’s right to opt out of EU measures. Mr Hayes was accompanied to the meeting by a senior civil servant, though it is not known how it was leaked to Mr Davey. Sources close to Mr Hayes say he was encouraged privately by Mr Cameron to press to delay the closure of coal-fired power stations to avoid an energy crisis. ‘John said the PM agreed that the energy crisis was getting worse,’ said a source close to Mr Hayes. ‘And Lib Dems are more interested in impractical green policies and not upsetting their friends in Brussels than keeping the lights on.’ At the time of Mr Hayes's sacking, both Mr .

"Aston Villa look set for a third consecutive Premier League relegation battle this season and supporters are beginning to turn on manager Paul Lambert and owner Randy Lerner. The Midlands club are currently 13th in the league just three points clear of the dreaded drop-zone and Villa have only scored 11 goals from 21 games this season. Supporters have proposed a large-scale protest in the Holte End of Villa Park ahead of the visit of Liverpool urging fans to leave their seat vacant for the first eight minutes, the number of years Lerner has been in charge of the club. David Michael of Aston Villa blog MyOldManSaid.com says supporters want their club back. Aston Villa supporters are losing patience with manager Paul Lambert and owner Randy Lerner . There’s a saying among Villa fans, that you don’t chose Aston Villa, it chooses you. At the moment though, supporting the club feels like having to serve a sentence  for a crime you didn’t commit. Since Martin O’Neill stormed out of the club after having drained chairman Randy Lerner’s resources in a bid to reach the honeypot of the Champions League, Villa have been in free fall. O’Neill ultimately failed, Lerner wasn’t impressed and Villa supporters simply suffered. Current boss Paul Lambert said after Villa’s last game, when responding to questions about agitated supporters calling for his head, that ‘the expectancy levels outweigh the realism’. Lambert knows, though, considering his 41 and 38-point season finishes and the unwanted records he’s collected, including having the worst Premier League record of any Villa manager, one thing fans have been is patient with him. Aston Villa were beaten 1-0 by Premier League strugglers Leicester last weekend . Sections of the Villa crowd called for Lambert to be sacked during the defeat to Nigel Pearson's side . I’ve lost count of the number of managers local rivals West Brom have fired during Lambert’s time at Villa Park. Even in the face of constant humiliation (losing to Bradford City in a semi-final, being beaten 8-0 by Chelsea, suffering a record 10 home league defeats in a season, and losing six games in a row this season), we’ve always hoped Lambert could turn it around. But he hasn’t. With 11 goals in 21 league games our ‘expectancy levels’ have now dropped to praying for shots on target and maybe seeing a Villa goal some day. It’s sad. Certainly in my lifetime, Villa have traditionally been considered a top-half team with ambitions of European football. I’ve personally seen them win everything bar the FA Cup. Yet, as the club enters its fifth consecutive relegation battle, fans' ambition has been dumbed down to Premier League survival. Tempers flared on the pitch after a bad challenge by Leicester's Matthew James led to a red card . Relegation shouldn’t even be in an Aston Villa supporter’s vernacular, and you have to feel sorry for the younger generation of Villa fans who have experienced nothing but the bland decay of their beloved club. The overriding problem is a lack of strategic consistency. There was a change in transfer policy from young and hungry (and cheap) to low-cost journeymen, an astonishing U-turn on the exiled ‘bomb squad’ players. While on the pitch, Lambert, recently switched to the same possession-based ethos he abandoned during his first season in charge. The latest edition, again offers a chronic lack of cutting edge in the final third, but hopefully the signing of Carles Gil will remedy that and make the increasingly disillusioned Christian Benteke a threat once again. Aston Villa have signed midfielder Carles Gil from Valencia for £3.25millon . Lambert attends press conference with his new signing, who he will hope can add a creative spark . Off the pitch, the last we heard directly from our chairman was a statement in May last year, saying he was selling the club. He told us: ‘I owe it to Villa to move on, and look for fresh, invigorated leadership, if in my heart I feel I can no longer do the job.’ He’s still the chairman, yet we haven’t heard from him since, although we are often reminded by Lambert that Lerner owns a telephone and television, so he knows what is happening at the club. But do you know he gave the Villa boss a new four-year contract, a mere four games after he ended the previous season with relegation form of 38 points? It’s baffling. Villa have only managed to scored 11 goals from 21 league games this season . The new Villa CEO Tom Fox talks about the club’s future being in Europe, but increasingly-worried supporters feel it’s more likely to be in the Championship. After all, we’ve heard the Europe line before from Fox’s predecessor. The proposed supporter demonstration of vacating the Holte End  for the first eight minutes of the game against Liverpool is simply saying ‘enough is enough’. This compromised version of Aston Villa can’t continue. We want to be confident of what the custodians of our club are doing. We want clarity. We want ambition. And most of all, we want our Villa back. Twitter: @oldmansaid .","Aston Villa supporters are planning a protest against owner Randy Lerner .

"A former Vassar student has sued the college after being expelled over what he says are false rape claims. Xiaolu 'Peter' Yu says he lost his virginity to Mary Claire Walker in February last year after a party, but she later accused him of rape and the school expelled him. Yu, a student from China, says he and Walker, both on the college's rowing teams, went back to his dorm room after a rowing club party on February 18, 2012, where they had consensual sex. Rowing row: Xiaolu 'Peter' Yu and Mary Claire Walker were both celebrating with teammates at a bar when, according to Yu, they went back to his dorm room to have consensual sex . According to the New York Post, papers filed by Yu in a Manhattan federal court yesterday say that he was expelled on Walker’s 'flimsy say-so', alleging that male students at the . formerly all-female college in Poughkeepsie are 'invariably found . guilty' when female students accuse them of sexual misconduct. The documents say that Yu and Walker, who is the daughter of a Vassar geology professor, engaged in 'clearly consensual sexual activity' in Yu's Vassar dorm room, and that Walker even sent Yu a message on Facebook the next day, telling him she 'had a wonderful time.' It's not known why Walker, who is due to graduate in 2014, accused Yu of rape a year after the alleged event, but the school's action was swift. Vassar's regulations state that 'Any student accused of rape will automatically and concurrently be charged with attempted rape, sexual assault, and attempted sexual assault. The minimum sanction for any student found guilty of rape will be immediate expulsion from the college.' Vassar girl: Mary Claire Walker remains a student at Vassar where her father is a geology professor and she studies biochemistry . Yu says the night he lost his . virginity, Walker was a willing participant. Before the pair arrived at . Yu's dorm, Walker had called her own roommate to see if they could . spend the night in her dorm room. In . Yu's dorm room, he told Walker it was his first time, and she told him . not to worry: 'It's OK, I know what to do,' the New York Post reports . Walker responded, before engaging in oral sex with Yu. Walker later put a condom on Yu and they had sex until his roommate came home, after which Walker 'began to lament about her . ex-boyfriend and stated that she was not ready to jump into anything . new' with Yu. The . documents filed with the Manhattan federal court state Walker then got . dressed and left after noting that she 'took Peter Yu’s . virginity,' reports the paper. Yu is seeking unspecified damages on . grounds including gender discrimination, breach of contract and . intentional infliction of emotional distress. Historical: Vassar is a private liberal arts college which was founded as a women's college in 1861 and became coeducational in 1969 . The court documents say Yu later learned that two women also on the rowing team, one of whom was his 'former romantic interest', had tried to contact campus security when they saw Yu walking home with Walker, 'who appeared to be drunk.' It's not clear what evidence was provided to Vassar to support Walker's claims, but Max Fraad-Wolf, who went through a similar experience to Yu in 1994, told The New York Times that he wasn't allowed to present evidence in his case and that he was not permitted a lawyer. A spokesman for Vassar, Jeff Kosmacher, told the New York Post that 'all student-conduct matters at Vassar are confidential.' 'Our student-conduct policies and procedures are closely reviewed by our attorneys, so they have strong legal grounding, and they’re also designed to consider the rights of all parties in matters like these,' he said. Xiaolu Yu was a candidate in the Vassar 2011 student elections, and told his fellow students: 'We are all here ready to explore a new life as college students and I am ready to help people to bring their voice to the college... Vote for me, and we will work in a group to making a tremendously positive difference to our home.'","Xiaolu 'Peter' Yu was expelled from Vassar College where he was a sophomore after what he says are false rape claims made by Mary Claire Walker .

"A college student is hoping to inspire others by eating bugs. Cam Brantley-Rios, a senior at Auburn University, has committed himself to a 30-day diet that includes bugs in all of his meals. And, being in college, this means mealworms, crickets and even cockroaches added to takeout, Chinese and Mexican food, and a lot of pizza. Scroll down for video . Cam Brantley-Rios, a senior at Auburn University, has committed himself to a 30-day diet that includes bugs in all of his meals . Worms in mushroom soup (above) was lunch for Brantley-Rios on day two of his diet . The young man was inspired by the growing trend among Americans to eat bugs, which have become known as a low-fat, high-fiber source of protein. 'I don't feel like I'm being adventurous at all,' he explained to The Washington Post. 'I'm a pretty picky eater.' No doubt helping Brantley-Rios is the fact that the taste is not much of an issue. 'They absorb flavors pretty damn well,' he said. 'Crickets work really well with taco seasoning and lime juice, so that's been working great.' His very first meal was an omelette with a little avocado and some mealworms (above) More worms, in oatmeal, along with a cricket bar (left) and his supplies for the month (right) He even started his own blog to detail his experience, 30 Days of Bugs, and seven days in is very much enjoying waxworms, which he said are 'incredibly adaptive,' and protein bars made with cricket flour. He also noted; 'For the self-conscious entomophagist, mealworms and chow mein are a great meal to eat in public.' And his new diet already seems to be having an influence on those close to him he revealed; 'It's starting to pick up as a sort of local movement. A lot of my friends are getting curious and having dinner with me, and then their friends are getting interested.' The best things about bugs though is how sustainable they are said Brantley-Rios, especially when compared to animal proteins. 'I didn't realize how sustainable it is to eat bugs. And I think a lot of people don't know. I mean I knew that there were people eating worms in other countries, but I didn't know that it was a healthy thing to do -- or that people really thought they tasted good,' he admitted. "" 'So that's what I'm trying to do, I guess. I just want to share the good news.' Brantley-Rios also said has one more challenge he wants to undertake before this is all over - 'eating a couple tarantulas.'","Cam Brantley-Rios, a senior at Auburn University, is adding insects, spiders and worms to his diet for the next 30 days .

"A photographer was left 'all shook up' after spotting the face of Elvis on the back of a bug. With markings on its back resembling human eyes, nose, mouth and a pompadour hairdo, the unusual stink bug bears an uncanny resemblance to the King of rock 'n' roll. Photographer Darlyne Murawski from Massachusetts, US spotted the Pentatomoidea bug, also known as a giant shield bug, by chance. The Pentomid bug spotted in a forest in Thailand. The insect bears an uncanny resemblance to Elvis. The unusual stink bug bears an uncanny resemblance to the King of rock n roll. Darlyne was on a photographic assignment with National Geographic in the Khao Chong Forest Reserve in southern Thailand, when she came across the unusual creature sitting on a leaf. She said: 'The instant I saw it, I did a double-take. I immediately thought of Elvis Presley with his pompadour hairdo and quickly pulled out my camera. 'Thank goodness it didn't fly away. 'I later found out that 'Elvis' was a giant shield bug, related to the stink bug family. 'It is found in Southeast Asia and I would guess it's uncommon since so many people hadn't seen it before. 'I was in the area for about three weeks, but sadly didn't encounter Elvis in the woods again.' The bug has previously been spotted in the forests of Singapore, where it was likened to the Sesame Street character Bert. There, it was captured by Winston Jansen, an amateur photographer who lives in the country. After passing hundreds of other . insects in  the  forest, this bug caught Mr Jansen's eye due . to its 'stunning colour and intricate camouflage'. Spotting the insect he quickly picked up his camera to . get up close - and discovered the face of the TV character branded across its back. Winston, 32, . said: 'I was simply in awe at the beauty of the camouflage - I know many . insects use it to avoid being preyed upon but I'd never seen anything . like it before. 'I was just captivated by the bright colours. 'Then on closer inspection it just hit me there is actually a face on its back. Usually found in Southeast Asia, the Pentatomoidea bug is also known as a giant shield bug. Shield bugs have glands in their thorax between the first and second pair of legs which produce a foul smelling liquid to deter predators. Winston, a banker from Singapore, first picked up a camera in 2009 and specialises in macro photography - a unique skill revealing details hidden in normal photography. He was visiting the forests specifically to shoot insects on a macro photography trip. He . added: 'It was about midday, I chanced upon this stink bug and . fortunately it was actually quite co-operative so I managed to take a . number of shots at different angles. 'I'd had a few insects scurry away earlier that day - but there was no way this one was getting away.' 'After I shot this bug I did some research when I got home and found out there are so many more variations of this species. 'I'm still hoping I will be able to capture more variations of it.'

"Wonderful moments  in life can come at the most unexpected times and in the most unexpected of places. A homeless man, who had been living on the streets for 30 years, is the unlikely star of this video which has gone viral and has been watched by over one and a half million people. The man known only as Ray is seen playing a poignant and beautiful song on the outdoor piano in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Dishevelled: Ho,meless man Ray looks dishevelled as Ms Polard approaches him . The video was captured after Roslyn Polard was passing by the piano in the city's Churchill Square when she was stopped in her tracks by the incredible music. Speaking to CBC News Ms Polard said she had to stop and turn around and go back, 'because it was so beautiful'. Reluctant star: The homeless man appears a little shy to begin with but he soon enjoys the attention . Talent: Ms Polard had approached the homeless man after she overheard his spontaneous piano performance . Two videos which were earlier posted on YouTube  also show a man with a similar appearance to Ray playing various pianos around Edmonton in recent weeks. The homeless man looks like he derives great enjoyment from playing the piano. 'You could see his face light up every time somebody walked by,' Ms Polard said. 'And he was happy to have an audience, he was happy to have someone to chat with.' The onlooker was worried her presence may have been invasive, however after she spoke with Ray she realised he was happy to have an audience. Magical: Once Ray starts playing he demonstrates his impressive talent for playing the piano . Enjoyment: The homeless man looks like he is lost in his performance at one stage during the video . Pride: After the impromptu performance homeless man Ray tells Ms Polard that he wrote the song himself . 'The music is beautiful. It really is,' she said. 'The juxtaposition of it — him sitting there and pouring his heart and soul into this song.' 'It was a completely spontaneous event,' she said. 'I feel very fortunate I was able to capture that.' The video was uploaded by Ms Polard on October 23 and it has been so popular that she subsequently licensed it and she is now benefitting from advertisement revenue. She has said she plans to find the homeless pianist and give him the money she has earned from the video.","Homeless man was filmed playing the public piano in Edmonton in Alberta .

"Whether it's Manolo Blahnik, Kurt Geiger or even New Look, no one could ever doubt that women love to splash the cash on a new pair of heels. However, the UK's shoe addiction doesn't come cheap, with British footwear fans spending a whopping £3.5 billion on shoes last year. But despite spending vast amounts on new shoes, two thirds never see the light of day, languishing unworn at the back of the wardrobe. A nation of footwear fans: British women spent £3.5 billion on new shoes last year . Luxury: Designer shoes such as these Louboutins are fuelling British women's passion for high heels . The survey, which was commissioned by the Diamond insurance company, found that the average woman owns 19 pairs of shoes, but only wears seven. Although the average woman owns a relatively modest 19 pairs, one in 20 admitted to owning more than 50 pairs, while seven per cent said they buy at least 10 pairs of shoes every year. What's more, for some extreme shoe devotees, their love of footwear has even caused rifts between them and their other halves. Natalie Grimshare, spokesperson for Diamond insurance company, said: 'According to our study, the average woman owns twice as many shoes as her partner. 'For some women their shoe spending habits have even caused arguments. 'As many as one in eight of the women we questioned told us they've argued with their partner either about the amount they spend on shoes or the sheer number of pairs they own.' Sky high: Most of the shoes bought had spike heels like this pair of Christian Louboutins . Expensive: Like Jennifer Lopez and Victoria Beckham, a third of women covet expensive Louboutin shoes . While many women covet designer brands such as Christian Louboutin and Nicholas Kirkwood, the average woman spends a reasonable £41 on a pair of shoes. The research also highlighted the British public's eye for a bargain with women preferring quantity over quality. 69 per cent of women said that if they were given a budget of £300 they would rather spend this on lots of cheaper shoes than just one designer pair. Nailing catwalk trends and looking as stylish as possible is a big driver of shoe sales, with high heels proving the most popular among women. Women polled even admitted to being willing to ditch comfort for style, with over a third of those questioned saying they wear uncomfortable spike heels just because they like the way the shoes look.","The average women owns 19 pairs of shoes but wears just seven .

A test for HIV that is 10 times more sensitive and a fraction of the cost of current methods, has been developed by British scientists. It uses nanotechnology to give a result that can be seen with the naked eye by turning a sample red or blue. Developed by scientists at Imperial College in London, the technique offers the promise of better diagnosis and treatment in the developing world. Research leader Molly Stevens, said: 'Our approach affords for improved . sensitivity, does not require sophisticated instrumentation and it is . ten times cheaper.' Simple and quick HIV tests that . analyze saliva already exist but they can only pick up the virus when it . reaches relatively high concentrations in the body. 'We . would be able to detect infection even in those cases where previous . methods, such as the saliva test, were rendering a 'false negative' because the viral load was too low to be detected,' Stevens said, after . the research was published in the journal Nature Nanotechnology. The test could also be reconfigured to detect other diseases, such as sepsis, Leishmaniasis, Tuberculosis and malaria, Stevens said. Testing is not only crucial in picking up the virus that causes Aids early but also for monitoring the effectiveness of treatments. 'Unfortunately, the existing gold standard detection methods can be too expensive to be implemented in parts of the world where resources are scarce,' Stevens said. Research leader: Molly Stevens said she is planning to work with not-for-profit global health organisations to distribute the new sensor . According to 2010 data from the World Health Organisation, about 23 million people living with HIV are in Sub-Saharan Africa out of a worldwide total of 34 million. The virus is also spreading faster and killing more people in this part of the world. Sub-Saharan Arica accounted for 1.9 million new cases out of a global total of 2.7 million in the same year, and 1.2 million out of the 1.8 million deaths. The new sensor works by testing serum, a clear watery fluid derived from blood samples, in a disposable container for the presence of an HIV biomarker called p24. If p24 is present, even in minute concentrations, it causes the tiny gold nanoparticles to clump together in an irregular pattern that turns the solution blue. A negative result separates them into ball shapes that generate a red color. The researchers also used the test to pick up the biomarker for Prostate Cancer called Prostate Specific Antigen, which was the target of previous work that Stevens did with collaborators at University of Vigo in Spain. That sensor used tiny gold stars laden with antibodies that latched onto the marker in a sample and produced a silver coating that could be detected with microscopes. Stevens and her collaborator on the new test, Roberto de la Rica, said they plan to approach not-for-profit global health organizations to help them manufacture and distribute the new sensor in low-income countries.","HIV sensor is 10 times more sensitive and a fraction of the cost of current methods .
