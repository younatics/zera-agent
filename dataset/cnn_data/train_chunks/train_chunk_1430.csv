"Michael Brown's stepfather has said sorry for his controversial and incendiary chants aimed towards the unarmed teen's supporters the night of the grand jury decision not to indict Officer Wilson. The apology comes one day after Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said that his department was actively pursuing an investigation into whether Louis Head incited the riots that left parts of the city a burning wreck. Head issued a statement to the effect that while he was sorry for screaming 'Burn this b**** down!', to arrest and charge him 'goes way too far and is as wrong as the decision (of the grand jury) itself.' The victim's stepfather (center) screamed 'Burn this b**** down' as he stood next to Brown's mother in the seconds after he learned of the grand jury's decision not to indict Officer Darren Wilson . Head, who is married to Brown's mother, apologized to those 'who read my pain and anger as a true desire for what I want for our community. It wasn't.' He said that he feels he is being unfairly blamed for the chaos that followed his outburst, which was videoed by the New York Times on November 24, moments after the grand jury decision came in. Furthermore, it is understood that Head will not face any charges for his furious invective last Monday night, despite Jackson's revelations on Fox News at the beginning of the week. Speaking on Monday night's Fox News, Jackson was asked by host Sean Hannity whether he believed charges should be pressed against Head for his role in the disturbances that evening, posing the question, 'Is that inciting a riot?' 'Something came over me as I watched and listened to my wife, the mother of Michael Brown Jr., react to the gut-wrenching news that the cop who killed her son wouldn't be charged with a crime, my emotions admittedly got the best of me. 'This is my family. I was so angry and full of raw emotions, as so many others were, and granted I screamed out words I shouldn't have screamed in the heat of the moment. I was wrong and I humbly apologize to all those who read my anger and my pain as a true desire for what I want for the community. 'To place blame solely on me for the conditions of our community and country after the Grand Jury decision goes way too far and is wrong as the decision itself. To declare a state of emergency and send a message of war, not peace, before a Grand Jury decision is announced is also wrong. 'In the end I've lived in this community for a long time. The last thing I truly wanted was to see it go up in flames. In spite of my frustration, it really hurt me to see that. It's time to rebuild. If we are to honor Michael Brown's memory we need to work together to make rebuilding happen. I plan to remain here and do my part in earnest truth.' In reply, Jackson said, 'We are pursuing those comments. And there is a lot of discussion going on about that right now. But I really can't get into that right now.' Ferguson police spokesman, Jeff Small clarified Jackson's comments and said that Head is 'one of the people being looked at as part of an ongoing investigation into the activities surrounding Nov 24 pertaining to the rioting, looting and arsons.' However, despite the claims from CNN that Head will not face charges, there has been no official confirmation. Lesley Michael Brown's mother Lesley McSpadden hugs Brown's stepfather who wore a 'I am Mike Brown shirt' Yesterday it was announced that law enforcement were looking into Louis Head's comments as part of a broader investigation into the arson, vandalism and looting that followed the November 24 grand jury announcement, St. Louis County Police spokesman Brian Schellman said. Twelve commercial buildings were destroyed by fire. Brown, 18, who was black and unarmed, was killed August 9 by Darren Wilson, who is white. Wilson, who resigned from the Ferguson department last weekend, had told the grand jury his life was being threatened, but some witnesses said Brown was trying to surrender. Video widely circulated after last week's grand jury announcement shows Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, on top of a car and breaking down as the decision blares over a stereo. Head, her husband, comforts her then yells angry comments, including 'Burn this bitch down!' Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, stood sobbing and screaming on top of a car with her husband and friends outside Ferguson police department after the grand jury decision . Family attorney Benjamin Crump has called the reaction 'raw emotion,' but 'completely inappropriate.' He did not immediately return messages seeking comment Tuesday. Charges? Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson has said that his department is pursuing an investigation into whether or not to charge Louis Head for inciting the Ferguson riots . Head has not yet been interviewed by police, and there is no timetable for when the investigation will be complete, Schellman said. He declined to discuss what specific charges Head could face. A message left with a spokesman for St. Louis County Prosecutor Bob McCulloch was not immediately returned. Ferguson police spokesman Jeff Small said that department is not conducting a separate investigation of Head. Most of the violence occurred in the first two days after the announcement. Peaceful protests have continued, including one Tuesday involving students who walked out of classes from three Ferguson-area high schools. The Ferguson-Florissant School District said in a letter to students and parents teachers accompanied the students to ensure their safety but that the protests were student-led. The letter also said the district dispatched transportation to pick up students and return them to classes, though some chose to walk back. It was their first day back in class after Thanksgiving break was extended a day due to bad weather Monday, when similar walkouts were staged across the country. While daytime protests continue, nighttime demonstrations have waned. There were 124 arrests in Ferguson in the five days following the grand jury announcement, but none since Friday.

As a result, police and the National Guard are scaling back. Schellman said county officers are no longer working 12-hour shifts, though a small contingent will remain posted at night outside Ferguson police headquarters, which has been a focal point for protest gatherings. CNN law enforcement analyst Tom Fuentes says no: . 'I think they'll have a hard time proving that somebody that heard him in the midst of all that noise actually went over and did an arson or committed an act of starting a fire. I think most of the people you see in the crowd are not watching CNN. They're not watching media reporting of him saying that,' he told 'The Situation Room.' 'So it is probably very few people that heard it at that time.' Gov. Jay Nixon also announced Tuesday that the National Guard has completed duties in the city of St. Louis and is reducing its presence - which peaked at about 2,200 guard members - in Ferguson and elsewhere in St. Louis County. Still, nearly 1,300 remain in the region. Nixon also said the Missouri State Highway Patrol will continue to work with local police. It was last Monday, after spending months appealing for calm that Michael Brown's family exploded into rage when it was announced that the grand jury had decided not to charge Officer Darren Wilson. Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, stood sobbing and screaming on top of a car with her husband and friends outside Ferguson police department. She wore a button pinned to her chest that read 'Indict Now and a white hat with a photo of her son which called for 'Justice for Mike Brown.' 'They wrong!' she yelled, pointing toward the police station. 'You all know, you're all wrong!' Although she wore sunglasses, her anger and devastation were clear as tears ran down her face. 'Everybody wants me to be calm. You know what them bullets did to my son!' 'They still don't care!' she screamed as she threw her arms in frustration. 'They never going to care!' She then buried her face in her the chest of the victim's stepfather, Louis Head, who wore a t-shirt reading: 'I am Mike Brown.' Disruption: Police confront protestors in Ferguson using armored vehicles and riot shields . Raid: Looters smashed their way into a local Ferguson business and helped themselves to products that it sold . He turned around to the incensed crowd and screamed: 'Burn this b**** down'. He did this at least ten times and called for a microphone at one point to spread his message to more people. At that, some of the crowd did become agitated toward the police. Wearing a t-shirt with the words 'I Am Mike Brown' while was expressing his rage toward the crowd and cameras, Head also had a beanie on that had a photograph of Michael Brown. As the roaring crowd began to surge forward, the pair were both whisked away by supporters. Head has a long rap sheet which includes two felony narcotics convictions and he pleaded guilty in 1997 to marijuana distribution and was put on probation for five years. In mid-2003, he pleaded guilty to a felony count of narcotics trafficking and he was sentenced to seven years in prison. He was released in 2008 after five years behind bars.","Said sorry day after Ferguson police chief said he might be arrested .

"A woman who endured almost a decade of failed IVF attempts and two miscarriages has finally become a mother – after taking an aspirin every day during her pregnancy. Sarah Broadfield, 34, feared she would never have children after spending £15,000 on fertility treatment and two miscarriages that left her devastated. But when she became pregnant again in November last year, she began taking the 2p aspirin each day after doctors said her miscarriages were caused by her blood being too 'sticky'. Sarah Broadfield, 34, finally gave birth to son Alfie (pictured) after seven rounds of IVF and two miscarriages . After being diagnosed with Antiphospholipis syndrome, which is known to cause miscarriages in pregnant women, Mrs Broadfield (pictured left during her pregnancy) was told to take a daily aspirin . The aspirin helped prevent a miscarriage and baby Alfie (pictured) was born in August weighing a healthy 8lb . She had been diagnosed with Antiphospholipid syndrome, which causes an increased risk of blood clots and miscarriage. However aspirin can help by thinning the blood, preventing this. Nine months later, her son Alfie was born in August 2014, weighing a healthy 8lb. Mrs Broadfield, a nurse, said: 'Finally holding Alfie in my arms after everything we've been through was the best moment of my life - and it's all thanks to me taking an aspirin a day.' She had married her 36-year-old husband Chris, an electrician, in 2006 and a year later they started trying for a baby, with hopes of eventually having two children. But, two years later, with no success, the couple went to see their GP for fertility tests. Although Mrs Broadfield had previously been diagnosed with endometriosis, doctors didn't believe this was affecting her fertility, but couldn't find another explanation. The couple were referred for IVF through the NHS but two rounds of treatment failed. 'The first failure was the most devastating because I really thought it would work,' Mrs Broadfield said. Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), which is also known as Hughes syndrome, is a disorder of the immune system that causes an increased risk of blood clots. Pregnant women with APS also have an increased risk of having a miscarriage, although the exact reasons for this are uncertain. At least 15 per cent of recurrent miscarriages (having three or more miscarriages in a row) occur as a result of APS, and it is now recognised as the most common, treatable cause. Generally, if a woman is diagnosed with APS following miscarriages, she will be treated daily with low dose aspirin (75mg-150mg). Treatment with aspirin can  help pregnant women improve their chances of having a successful pregnancy. With treatment, it's estimated there is about an 80 per cent chance of having a successful pregnancy. In April this year, U.S. scientists found low doses of the drug could improve the chances of conception and of having a live birth. It can help women who have recently lost a baby to conceive again . This could be because the drug increases blood flow to the womb, they said. 'Even though I knew it wasn't my fault, I blamed myself. I felt like I'd failed as a woman.' When a third IVF cycle failed, the couple scraped together their savings, as well as getting some help from their parents, and paid for a fourth attempt at a private hospital. They were delighted when Sarah became pregnant a few weeks later. At the six week scan, everything looked fine but, two weeks later, a second scan showed that she had suffered a 'silent miscarriage' and the baby had stopped developing in her womb. 'It was heart-breaking but we were reassured that at least I'd managed to become pregnant this time. 'When it happened for a second time though, we started to wonder if there was a serious problem,' she said. Following the two miscarriages at eight weeks, the couple were referred to the Liverpool Miscarriage Clinic and blood tests showed that Mrs Broadfield had Antiphospholipid syndrome (AS), a disorder of the immune system which causes an increased risk of blood clots. People with AS are at risk of developing deep vein thrombosis and artery clots, but the condition is particularly dangerous to pregnant women as it can lead to miscarriages. It's estimated that AS is responsible for one in six cases of multiple miscarriages, as well as one in six cases of deep vein thrombosis. For Mrs Broadfield, the condition did not explain why she hadn't become pregnant naturally - but did explain why she'd miscarried twice. She said: 'It was such a relief to know what was wrong and the solution seemed impossibly simple.' Because of its blood-thinning qualities, an aspirin a day has long been hailed as a means of preventing strokes and some experts say it could also reduce the risk of cancer. Doctors advised Mrs Broadfield the daily tablet throughout her pregnancy would thin her blood and dramatically reduce the risk of her miscarrying for a third time. So, the couple embarked on their final round of IVF, with two eggs from previous attempts being implanted. Mrs Broadfield married electrician husband Chris, 36, in 2006 and a year later they started trying for a baby . At the 20 week scan doctors said Alfie was developing normally, but Mrs Broadfield said she was a 'nervous wreck' before every scan, 'waiting for them to deliver bad news' 'By that stage, we were wrung-out, emotionally and financially so we decided it would be our last go,' she added. Weeks later, she became pregnant with twins and started her 'aspirin therapy', as well as having an anti-clotting injection daily throughout the pregnancy. Sadly, at the six week scan, the couple were told that one of the foetuses had failed. But, despite their disappointment, they were relieved to see the second baby was developing normally. Aspirin, which helped her give birth to son Alfie, was 'modern day magic', Mrs Broadfield said . 'The doctors kept a really close eye on us, which was reassuring, but I was still a nervous wreck before every scan, waiting for them to deliver bad news,' she said. Superstitious, Mr and Mrs Broadfield even waited until the later stages of the pregnancy before preparing their baby's nursery. As her risk of having a stillbirth was heightened, the baby was induced at 38 weeks and the couple's baby boy Alfie came along on August 1st 2014. Mrs Broadfield described how holding her baby in her arms was a moment of both joy and terror. She said: 'Just after he was born, he went quiet and I panicked. Then we heard him cry and it was the best moment ever,' she said. She added: 'Holding him in my arms, it felt so surreal, as we'd waited so long to meet him.' The next day, they brought Alfie home and he continues to thrive. 'They have no plans to embark on more IVF but she knows what to do if another baby were to come along. 'If only I'd known that taking one aspirin a day could help me so much,' she said. 'It would have saved us a lot of heartache. 'I wanted to speak out to hopefully help any other women who might have this condition without knowing it. 'For us, the aspirin was modern day magic and we always keep a box in our cupboard now, just in case.'","Sarah Broadfield, 34, thought she would never become a mother .

"Victim: Jane Bartholomew, 39, (pictured) was killed by her former boyfriend Scott Ellis, who was 'obsessed' with films and serial killers, a court heard . A man 'obsessed' with films and serial killers battered his former girlfriend to death with a claw hammer on Friday 13th, a court heard today. Scott Ellis, 42, is accused of attacking Jane Bartholomew, 39, after using a spare key to get into her home in Martlesham Heath, near Ipswich, Suffolk. He waited for his former partner to return home from taking two of their daughters to school, before killing her and slashing his own wrists, Ipswich Crown Court heard. The court was told thatunemployed Ellis, a heavy cannabis smoker who had suffered from depression for years, could not accept that his 25 year relationship with Miss Bartholomew was over. He allegedly assembled a 'killing kit' in the days before attacking her on Friday, June 13 this year, buying a hammer from a hardware store, and adding nylon rope, scissors, a modelling knife, bin liners, freezer bags, duct tape and a spade. Ellis, who had suffered minor injuries, was taken to hospital and arrested after Miss Bartholomew's body was found. A post mortem examination on the mother-of-three who worked in an electronics factory found she had suffered 22 blows to her head and had been strangled. Ellis of Tunstall near Woodbridge denies murder, but has admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. Tiler Mark Mayhew, who had been friends with Ellis since school, said in a statement read to the court: 'Scott is obsessed with films.' He added: 'He was interested in notorious serial killers and knew a lot about them. He saw programmes about them and read books which made him knowledgeable about them.' The court heard how Ellis, who lived in a converted garage at his mother's home, was the father of Bartholomew's three daughters. Scene: The court was told that Ellis, 42, used a spare key to get into Miss Bartholomew's home in Martlesham Heath, near Ipswich, Suffolk, (pictured) and then waited for her to arrive home . The couple were said to have lived apart for around ten years, but continued in an 'on and off' relationship. Mr Mayhew said Miss Bartholomew had been urging Ellis to get a job so they could be together 'like a normal family'. However, he said that his friend later hacked into her email and discovered that she had put her profile on an internet dating website. He added that Ellis had told him how he grabbed Miss Bartholomew by the throat and pushed her into a thorn bush at her workplace on May 22, leaving her with red marks on her neck. Partner: Miss Bartholomew had been urging Ellis to get a job so they could be together 'like a normal family', the court heard . Miss Bartholomew later told him in an internet conversation that her relationship with Ellis was over. Mr Mayhew added: 'On Friday the 13th of June, I got a call from Scott at 2pm. Scott was in tears in a really bad way. He was crying and said. 'Mate you have got to come right now'.' He said he drove to see Ellis at his home, but was turned away by his mother. Peter Gair, prosecuting, said police officers used a crowbar to break into Miss Bartholomew's semi-detached home and found her body after the alarm was raised by the couple's 15-year-old daughter, who found the house locked. Her  body was on the living room floor with her arms and legs bound with rope, a bag over her head and her feet covered by a bin liner. She had damage to her fingernails consistent with her 'clawing' at her attacker as well as broken bones and bruising on her arms and hands consistent with her raising her arms to defend herself, added Mr Gair. Ellis told police that he had been lying in wait for Miss Bartholomew and attacked her with the hammer when she returned home. He also told officers that he had wanted her to die because she had 'hurt' him and he had intended to slit his wrists and die beside her. Mr Gair added: 'He said he felt he couldn't live without her and didn't want her to meet anyone else. 'This killing was premeditated and planned and we say in all probability motivated by anger and rejection. We say the killing was brutally executed.' Mr Gair said that Ellis had attacked his former partner from behind, striking her repeatedly over the head with the hammer and putting his hand over her mouth to stop her screaming. Trial: Ipswich Crown Court (pictured) was told that Ellis had tried to clear up after Miss Bartholomew's death . After allegedly tying her legs and arms  and putting bags over her head and feet he tried to clean up some of the blood before leaving the house and locking the door behind him, the court heard. Jason Ball, another friend of Ellis, told the court that Ellis had told him he would be better off if she had died. He said he also got a call from Ellis 'at 2pm on Friday the 13th of June'. Mr Ball added: 'He was very distressed and not making too much sense. He said. 'I have done Jane' or 'I have done something terrible'.' Mr Ball's brother Steven Ball who also spoke to Ellis before the killing said: 'Jane was putting pressure on him to get a job and be more responsible for the children. 'He said to me in April or May, 'I feel like taking a hammer to her, cutting her up, putting her in bags and getting rid of her in the sea.' I thought it was over the top, but I didn't think he was serious at the time.' The trial continues.

"When it comes to losing weight quickly and effectively, one nutritionist claims we should look to the eating habits of toddlers as the perfect example of what diet plan to follow. Nicolette Pace, who is based in New York, told ABC News that babies have an organic rhythm when it comes to refueling their bodies and insisted that adults could benefit to learn from their food habits. 'We prioritize everything above eating. But our babies - if they're hungry we'll move hell and high water to make sure they're fed,' she said. Scroll down for video . Baby talk: New York-based nutritionist Nicolette Pace says that adults could lose weight by behaving more like toddlers, who push food away when they're no longer hungry . Ms Pace went on to point out that babies almost never skip meals, while it's common for adults to forgo food when putting in long hours at work. She added that babies tend to push food away when they're no longer hungry, and are not likely to spend an entire day snacking on chips like their grown-up counterparts might. What's more, babies have their portions controlled for them, which is especially important as a newborn's stomach is only about the size of a cherry. 'It grows as they grow and by adulthood our stomachs are about the size of a softball,' she said, explaining that it's key to know what our stomachs can handle. Steady diet: 'We prioritize everything above eating. But our babies - if they're hungry we'll move hell and high water to make sure they're fed,' Ms Pace (pictured) said . Ms Pace also advised taking at least 15 minutes to finish a meal. 'Babies don't rush through their meals. They slow down and enjoy,' she said. And finally, she recommends eating in intervals of two to four hours - the length of time that food stays in one's stomach. Ms Pace, who shares more nutrition advice on her website NutriSource, further warned against the dangers of eating too quickly in a recent blog post. 'Eating fast is one of the most common habits people with weight problems face,' she wrote. 'Even though the body has an intricate signaling system to alert you as to when you’ve had enough, a 24/7 lifestyle can override these subtle suggestions and you end up wolfing down your meal.'",Nutritionist Nicolette Pace says that babies' behaviors such as pushing away food when they're no longer hungry could benefit adults .

Sixteen-years-ago Natalia was selling bananas in the market to help make ends meet. It's nothing to be ashamed of.' Larissa, who also had a daughter with cerebral palsy, said Natalia has been 'incredibly supportive' of the family and understands her mother's to desire to keep working.

I remember once finding a rouble on the street – at a time when the average salary was perhaps 25 roubles a month; I grabbed it with a feeling of euphoria, ran back to my mother and was allowed to go shopping for food with it. It was a wonderful feeling to be able to do that for my family. From very early on, I had a strong sense of responsibility.' Cover girl: Natalia is always in demand for fashion campaigns .

"Protection: Harris has been moved to Stafford prison after being bullied by inmates at HMP Bullingdon . Disgraced entertainer Rolf Harris has been moved to a 'soft' prison after being bullied by inmates. The 84-year-old has been transferred to Stafford jail, which has two separate wings for 'vulnerable' sex offenders, from HMP Bullingdon, in Oxfordshire. He was moved prison following a number of incidents where he was targeted by fellow inmates. A source said: 'The other prisoners were keen to take him down a peg or two. He was moved to another prison for his own safety about two weeks ago.' In July, the former TV personality was spat at by an inmate during a prison church service which sparked a mass brawl. Other prisoners verbally abused Harris from the pews of the chapel. Witnesses claimed the inmate tried to spit on the convicted paedophile but missed and hit another prisoner. The incident led to an attack between the two convicts, who began throwing punches and had to be separated by officers. Harris also angered fellow inmates when he was accused of receiving special treatment after landing the 'plum job' of prison gardener. The Australian was paid to look after the vegetable patch and parts of the ground, despite one prisoner saying he had been waiting 12 months for a similar job. Easy living: Harris has been moved to Stafford prison, which has separate wings for 'vulnerable' sex offenders . Elsewhere, Harris faced threats from prisoners on his wing for hogging the prison phones. The shamed TV star chattered for up to an hour each time on one of the five phones shared between 140 inmates to call his wife Alwen and daughter Bindi. It was also reported that Harris had lost a stone since being jailed, as he disliked the taste of prison food. Harris, who had previously enjoyed eating curried lobster and roast quail as part of his pre-prison diet, struggled to adjust to prison meals such as tuna salads and low-fat chicken curries. But more recently, it was claimed Harris had won over some of the prisoners by signing drawings for convicts who queue outside his cell. However, the artist, who painted an official portrait of the Queen, was banned from painting last week because prison bosses decided his oils pose a fire risk. It meant he was forced to use pencils for his sketches instead. Disgraced: Harris was convicted in June of 12 indecent assaults on four girls as young as eight. He is pictured here with his daughter Bindi, right, and his wife Alwen, left, who is said to regularly visit him in jail . Harris was convicted of 12 indecent assaults on June 30 at Southwark Crown Court by Mr Justice Sweeney - one on an eight-year-old autograph hunter, two on girls in their early teens and a catalogue of abuse of his daughter's friend over 16 years. During the trial, Harris, a family favourite for decades, was finally unmasked as a predator who was fixated with under-age girls. Jurors were told how his 16-year campaign of sex abuse against his daughter's friend ‘haunted’ her and made her abandon her dreams as he continued to be adored by millions of fans worldwide. Passing sentence, Justice Sweeney said: 'You have shown no remorse for your crimes at all. Your reputation now lies in ruins, you have been stripped of your honours but you have no one to blame but yourself.' His fall from grace was underlined as he was stripped of a Bafta fellowship and accolades in his native Australia were removed, and he faces losing his prestigious CBE. The performer's multi-million pound fortune is also at risk from potential compensation claims. He was jailed for five years and nine months for the sex abuse, meaning that he is due to serve just under three years for the crimes, which spanned between 1968 and 1986. The Prison Service said: 'We don't comment on individuals.' A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice said: 'We would not describe the prison as soft, it is more simply more appropriate for this type of offending. 'The prison is somewhere where they hold this type of offender and so it is easier to have them in one place.'","Rolf Harris has been moved to Stafford jail from HMP Bullingdon .

"In the midst of a grueling, final-hour push by Congress to rescue the economy from the looming fiscal cliff, House Speaker John Boehner sought brief reprieve with an evening of margaritas and Mexican fare in Arlington, a source told Mail Online. Dressed in a festive, bright red sweater, a cheery Boehner arrived through a side door at Guapo's in Shirlington around 7:15 p.m. Friday - about three hours after he left stone-faced from a meeting at the White House with other congressional leaders and President Obama - according to a diner who happened to arrive at the restaurant around the same time. Accompanying Boehner to his table Friday were about six men - all security detail - who stood behind him for about 30 seconds and then sat down at a table nearby, said the diner, who works in government and said she wished to remain anonymous. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, was spotted at Guapo's Restaurant in Arlington Friday evening drinking margaritas with a group of three . After his night at Guapo's, Boehner returned to Capitol Hill, where senators were working on a solution to avert the fiscal cliff . Boehner was drinking margaritas while most of his party - two men and one woman - were drinking beer and sangria, the source said. They were all chomping on chips and salsa at the table. Other diners in the restaurant recognized the House Speaker and approached his table to say hello, the source noted. Boehner was 'very friendly to anyone that went up and spoke to him,' she said. Despite the long weekend of work ahead of him, 'He and his group were laughing and having a good time,' the source said. Several times throughout the evening Boehner stepped outside - through the side door - to take smoke breaks with some of his security detail, she added. 'We saw him walking out when we were leaving at 8:30,' she said. 'We passed two of his detail driving away then so we assumed he was leaving for the night, but it could have just been another smoke break.' Meanwhile, on Saturday, Senate leaders were working feverishly in private for a last-hour budget solution that could prevent the fiscal cliff - a package of tax increases for the middle class tax and deep spending cuts - from being triggered at dawn on New Year's Day. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Democrat, and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, are trying to find a solution in time for votes Sunday night by both houses. Whatever manages to pass in the Senate, with its Democratic majority, would then face a second test in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. Boehner arrived at the restaurant through a side door about three hours after he left a White House meeting on the fiscal cliff, and he'd changed out of his work clothes and into a festive red sweater . Boehner and his party at Guapo's were 'laughing and having a good time' - a far cry from how he appeared after his meeting at the White House hours earlier . Boehner, a Republican speaker who has . struggled recently with anti-tax rebels inside his own party, said . through an aide that he would await the results of the talks between the . Senate and White House. With the deadline for action fast approaching, Obama reiterated his demand for Congress to strike a deal that would prevent taxes from rising on the middle class. 'It's a balanced plan — one that would protect the middle class, cut spending in a responsible way, and ask the wealthiest Americans to pay a little more,' Obama said in his weekly radio address. 'And I'll keep working with anybody who's serious about getting a comprehensive plan like this done — because it's the right thing to do for our economic growth.' Obama is expected to renew his demands during a rare appearance on NBC's 'Meet the Press' on Sunday. In a rebuttal to Obama on Saturday, Republicans held their ground on their view of how the fiscal cliff should be resolved. 'The president's proposal to raise taxes on the top 2 percent of Americans won't even pay one-third of the annual interest that's now owed on this massive $16 trillion debt,' Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Missouri, said. 'We still can avoid going over the fiscal cliff if the president and the Democrat-controlled Senate step forward this week and work with Republicans to solve this problem and solve it now.'","A witness told MailOnline about John Boehner's night out Friday .

"Mothers are ‘worth less’ to employers in the City than men, Nigel Farage claimed today. The Ukip leader suggested women who take time off to have children are paid less because they lose contact with their client base and struggle to succeed when they return to work. Hours after making the controversial remarks, Mr Farage complained it was 'not very nice' being clobbered over the head with a placard as he tried to enter push his way through an angry protest in Kent. Scroll down for video . Mr Farage was confronted by a crowd of angry protesters as he arrived at an event in Thanet, Kent today . As he battled through the crowds, he was hit over the head with a placard which crumbled under the force . Addressing an audience . in the City this morning, Mr Farage insisted there is no sex . discrimination in financial services because childless women do ‘as well . or better than men’. In . highly-controversial remarks, Mr Farage – who has previously defended . the City’s culture of drinking and strip clubs – said women can succeed . in the industry as long as they are willing to ‘sacrifice the family . life’. He also rejected the idea of becoming a stay-at-home father who allowed his wife to pursue a career. But hours later he was physically attacked as he tried to attend an event in Margate in Kent. He said the incident, outside a hotel, was worse than when an angry mob blockaded him in an Edibnurgh pub last year. 'In . Edinburgh they cane along to make a noise. Here they came to bar me . from actually physically entering this hotel, and with intent to . physically hurt me,' he told ITV Meridian. 'So that's not very nice. I didn't like it but it is not going to stop me.' Ukip leader Nigel Farage said women who take time off to have children lose their client base and become less valuable to employers . ON LAPDANCING‘Lap . dancing? Don’t have the time these days, but I used to go to them. Like . it or not, they are a fact of life. You are talking about normal . behaviour there. Everyone does it... Prostitution and lap dancing are not the same thing, they can be but not usually.' ON DRINKING'I’ll tell you something. I work an 18 hour day most days and I think I’m entitled at lunchtime to a pint.' ON MARGARET THATCHER'I . cannot believe that a young Margaret Thatcher leaving Oxford today . would join the Conservative party led by John Major. I think she’d come . and get involved in UKIP.' ON EU PRESIDENT HERMAN VAN ROMPUY'You have the charisma of a damp rag, and the appearance of a low-grade bank clerk. And the question that I want to ask... that we're all going to ask, is ""Who are you ?"". I'd never heard of you. Nobody in Europe had ever heard of you.' ON ENOCH POWELL'Enoch Powell was an extraordinary fellow. I admired him for having the guts to talk about an issue that seemed to be to be really rather important – immigration, society, how do we want to live in this country.' Speaking in London this morning, Mr Farage rejected the idea that the . City is still an ‘old boys’ although he admitted that in the 1980s it . was a ‘deeply sexist place’. But he insisted the culture had changed and women could be successful – provided they did not have children. Mr Farage said: ‘You are as valuable as the client base that sticks with you and will move with you. ‘In many, many cases, women make different choices in life than what men make simply for biological reasons. ‘And . if a woman has a client base, has a child and takes two or three years . off work, she is worth far less to the employer when she comes back than . when she went away because her client base will not have stuck rigidly . to her.’ Mr Farage said . there was no ‘discrimination against women at all’ in the City, adding: . ‘Young, able women who are prepared to sacrifice the family life and . stick to their career will do as well or better than men.' While growing numbers of men were choosing to stay-at-home to allow partners to return to work, Mr Farage added: ‘I have to admit I was never going to be one of them myself.' Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman said Mr Farage was ‘downright wrong’. She added: ‘There’s not a single business or public service in this country which would still have the lights on if women weren’t there at work. ‘And yes, women do an important role in the home as well, not least because men don’t share equally in the home and therefore it falls to women. ‘But women are vital in their work and I think that is an  affront to women in this country and I just can’t believe that he’s said that.’ Kirsty Ayre, a partner at the international law firm Pinsent Masons, said: ‘These remarks reflect an incredibly narrow  view of worth.’ She added: ‘The days when you evaluate someone’s contribution based on their book of contacts are long gone and employers risk losing out  on top talent if that is their attitude.’ Mr Farage also hit back at attacks on . Ukip, after he suspended a councillor who blamed the Christmas and New . Year floods on David Cameron’s decision to legalise gay marriage. David . Silvester claimed last week that the country had been ‘beset by storms’ because the Prime Minister had acted ‘arrogantly against the Gospel’ by . passing same-sex marriage laws. Ukip’s . leadership had originally refused to discipline Mr Silvester, 73, a . town councillor in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, saying that everyone . was entitled to their religious views. But he was finally suspended yesterday afternoon after defying a request not to do further interviews on his beliefs. However, . Mr Farage today suggested that the remarks had only become a story . after Mr Silvester joined Ukip from the Tory party, where he had . previously aired similar views. Women who 'sacrifice' family life can still be successful in the financial sector, Mr Farage said . Speaking . in a question-and-answer session in the City, the Ukip leader said: 'I . think it is very interesting that, when Mr Silvester was saying these . things in 2012 and 2013 as a Conservative town councillor in Henley, it . was not a news story. But suddenly he switches to Ukip and continues the . same thing and gets on the national news. 'I . think that shows you and tells you all you need to know. The . establishment, the status quo, the big businesses, the big Eurocrats and . our three so-called main political parties are scared witless by what . Ukip is doing because we are striking a chord not just for ordinary . people but for many elements in the business community as well. 'They will try to do whatever they can to shoot us down.' Mr Silvester angered party bosses by going on local radio to say that being gay was a ‘spiritual disease’ which can be healed.","Ukip leader says mothers who take time off lose contact with client base .

"A Chinese woman has undergone drastic surgery to remove just under one stone of tissue from her breasts. The woman, known only as Mrs Lin, from Xiamen in China's Fujian Province, noticed her chest began to grow rapidly in her 30s. The now 50-year-old finally visited doctors when the size became unbearable. Scroll down for video . Mrs Lin, 50, underwent surgery to reduce the size of her enormous breasts (pictured left before the surgery). The doctor who performed the operation said they were the biggest he had seen in his career. He removed 6kg of fat leaving her with a manageable C-cup bust (pictured right after the procedure) She said: 'My breasts were normal sized even after I gave birth at 20, but they grew up crazily when I was 30.' Dr Ouyang Zhong, from Xiamen University's 1st Hospital, said despite working as a doctor for more than a decade, he had never seen breasts as large as Mrs Lin's. 'Her breasts hung even under the bellybutton,' he said. He removed 6kg – just under one stone – of fat to shrink her breasts to a manageable C cup. The amount of fat removed weighs almost twice as much as an average newborn baby, he said. The medical term for giant breasts is gigantomastia, a form of a condition known as hypertrophy of the breast tissue. It is a rare medical condition and is diagnosed where the breasts weigh more than three per cent of the total body weight. The consequences of having large breasts can be devastating, ranging from crippling back pain, neck and arm pain to headaches, friction rash and a curvature of the spine. It can cause stretching of the skin, which can sometimes lead to sores appearing. Over time, the physical strain of the breasts can cause breathing problems. Mrs Lin's breasts had been growing 'crazily' every since she was 30, so she eventually decided to go to hospital to see if doctors could do anything to help . Many women who have the condition suffer depression, lack of self-esteem and wellbeing. Gigantomastia is diagnosed when breast weight exceeds three per cent of a person's body weight. The enlargement can cause muscle pain, and over-stretching of the skin, which can lead to ulceration. The condition usually affects one breast more than the other, causing asymmetry. It is thought the underlying cause of the condition is a heightened sensitivity to female hormones prolactin, oestrogen and progesterone. Embarrassment can deter women from exercising, leaving them prone to health problems linked to obesity, including diabetes and heart disease. A study published in the Journal of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery in 2012 found that a woman with very large breasts can lose five years off her expected lifespan if she does not have a reduction. The condition can affect both breasts equally, but usually affects one breast more than the other, causing different-sized breasts. In Mrs Lin's case, her right breast was larger than her left. Gigantomastia is thought to be caused by sensitivity to the female hormones prolactin, estrogen and progesterone, or an abnormally elevated level of these hormones in the blood, or both. Sometimes it occurs naturally in pregnancy, but usually the breasts shrink again a few months after the baby is born. It is usually treated with breast-reducing drugs, or testosterone. If at least 1.8kg of breasts tissue needs to be removed then surgery is sometimes offered. Procedures include a reduction mammoplasty, an operation to reduce the size of the breasts, or a mastectomy, which removes all of the breast tissue altogether.","Mrs Lin, 50, noticed her breasts began to grow 'crazily' in her 30's .

"Discovered: The body of Kosta Karageorge was found on Sunday in a dumpster two blocks from his Columbus, Ohio, apartment . Missing Ohio State football player, Kosta Karageorge, has been found dead in a dumpster, days after sending his mother cryptic texts apologizing for being 'an embarrassment' because of his repeated concussions. Police spokesman Sgt. Rich Weiner said police received a call around 2:30 p.m. from someone reporting a body found in the trash bin in Columbus. Weiner said a woman and her son apparently were looking for items in the dumpster when they found the body, which had suffered a self-inflicted gunshot wound. 'At this time we are able to confirm through tattoos here at the scene that it is the body of Kosta Karageorge,' Weiner said. Weiner also revealed that a handgun was recovered from the dumpster. Police found the body near the campus after a search began when Karageorge went missing Wednesday. The senior defensive tackle had last been seen at his apartment in Columbus, when his roommates said he left to go on a walk. Susan Karageorge told police she had received a text from her son about 1:30am on Wednesday that said, 'I am sorry if I am an embarrassment but these concussions have my head all f***ed up.' The body was found within a couple hundred yards of Karageorge's home and about a half block from High Street, the main artery of the campus. Sunday evening, no one answered when an Associated Press reporter knocked on the metal door of Karageorge's apartment. Karageorge's parents filed a missing-person report Wednesday evening, and his mother, Susan Karageorge, told police he had had several concussions and a few spells of being extremely confused, according to the report. She said that at about 1:30 a.m. Wednesday he texted a message apologizing and saying the concussions had messed up his head. 'I am sorry if I am an embarrassment,' he said. Scroll down for video .

University athletic officials said they were grieved to learn of Karageorge's death. 'It's hit the team hard,' team spokesman Jerry Emig said. Ohio State Athletic Director Gene Smith said in a text message when asked about any plans to honor the player or logistics for the team to attend the funeral that it was too soon to answer those questions. The Buckeyes will play Wisconsin in the Big Ten championship game Saturday at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis.

We love him, and we want him home.' Webber urged anyone that may have seen him to contact police. 'If you think you saw a 6'5', 250lb man, there aren't many out there. Chances are, it's him,' he said. His appeal came as a group of former Ohio State players tweeted their offer of a $1,000 cash reward for information that leads to Karageorge, who also goes by his middle name Alex. Ohio State University's football stadium went silent Saturday as an announcer called out his name and the missing poster appeared on the scoreboard. The senior was reported missing after he uncharacteristically skipped two practices.

"A young boy has raised more than £40,000 for 'Movember'  - despite being unable to grow facial hair. Each year November heralds the annual challenge as men across the world grow moustaches for charity to raise awareness of male cancers. But determined to honour his granddad who died of cancer, William Heath,  from Earls Barton in Northamptonshire, refused to be left out. And so the creative 12-year-old dressed up as a different moustached character each day. From Ron Burgundy of Anchorman fame, to wrestler Hulk Hogan, and comic character, Borat, William stayed in costume for as long as was possible each day. He decided to take on the challenge in memory of his granddad, who died from pancreatic cancer in February. He is now the eighth biggest fundraiser out of more than 135,000 males who've taken on the Movember challenge this year. William Heath, 12, from Northamptonshire has dressed up as famous moustached characters throughout November to raise money for the Movember campaign. He is pictured imitating Will Ferrell's Ron Burgundy character made famous by the Anchorman films . Though as a 12-year-old William is unable to grow facial hair, he was determined to raise money for the campaign in honour of his granddad Robin Wickham, left, who died of pancreatic cancer in February . He is currently the 8th biggest fundraiser out of more than 135,000 men who have taken part in the Movember challenge this year. For one of his challenges he dressed up as the wrestler Hulk Hogan . William's mother, Clare Heath, 43, told MailOnline: 'William and his Pappa were really close and William wanted to do something positive in his memory. 'He's too young to run a marathon or climb Kilimanjaro, so as Movember approached we both knew it might be perfect. 'William and his Pappa loved going to see Northampton Saints play rugby together, which every November has a big 'Front Mo Union' campaign, so there was that angle too.' The obvious problem was that William can't grow facial hair, but one day towards the end of October he and his mother were in a local pound shop where William picked up a stick-on moustache, and the idea was born. As a family they expanded the fake moustache concept to William dressing up as a different famous character each day in November, from Ron Burgundy to Magnum PI to Ali G. William's 12th birthday was on November 1, so he and his mother posted photos of William in his different outfits, asking friends and family to make a donation towards his Movember campaign, rather than buy him a present. 'They were way more popular than we could have ever imagined, and soon we were getting requests from people all over the world for William to dress up as specific characters,' Ms Heath said. 'Dylan Hartley, who captains the Front Mo Union, regularly sends supporting tweets, Keith Lemon is re-tweeting us, not to mention hundreds of complete strangers from around the world who've been so incredibly generous. William's mother, Clare Heath, 43, said: 'William and his Pappa were really close and William wanted to do something positive in his memory.' He is pictured dressed up as Borat, right . William's granddad, Robin Wickham, had previously survived having both testicular and prostate cancer, but was diagnosed with aggressive pancreatic cancer on Christmas Eve. He died on February 7, aged 71 . 'If you'd asked me at the start of the month what we might achieve I'd have said a few smiles and £200 – it's spiralled into such a fantastic success story, and William is so proud. 'We've got pledges to take us over the £5,000 mark now, and by the end of Sunday we could have even more than that.' As well as being eighth overall, William is the number one fundraising student for Movember, the Front Mo Union, the Premiership Rugby Network and the UK Rugby Network. William's granddad, Robin Wickham, had previously survived having both testicular and prostate cancer, but was diagnosed with aggressive pancreatic cancer on Christmas Eve. He died on  February 7, aged 71. 'My dad was such a fun-loving man, and all his nine grandchildren loved him to bits,' Ms Heath said. 'He was the embarrassing dad on the dance floor at parties, always poking fun at life, and he'd have loved to been here to help William dress up. There couldn't be a more fitting tribute.' Miss Heath said another obstacle to William taking part in the challenge was his Asperger's. 'He's sensitive to textures and smells, so dressing in different costumes was a particular challenge for him,' Ms Heath said. 'He was often simply overwhelmed and has regularly had to have a word with himself to soldier on, reminding himself what he's doing this for. William told MailOnline: 'My granddad and I were very close. I know he'd giggle if he could see me in all these silly costumes' 'Sometimes he's told me he can't carry on, but every morning he pulls himself together and puts on another outfit.' Every morning William's older sister Isobel, 13, has helped him get changed and takes the photographs, which are then uploaded onto Facebook, Twitter and his 'Mo' space. William told MailOnline: 'My granddad and I were very close. He used to come on holiday with us and was always having fun, cracking jokes and making me laugh. 'I know he'd giggle if he could see me in all these silly costumes – I've made them from things I've found at home and also bits I've picked up from the fancy dress shop near us. 'My favourite so far has been Ali G, but Ned Flanders was hard – I tried painting my face yellow, but it didn't work.' Ms Heath added: 'We needed to fill 30 days. When you try to think of 30 people with moustaches it is harder than you think. 'The overriding thing is that it has been fun, but it has serious implications. We're already trying to come up with something similarly entertaining and engaging for next year's campaign.'","William Heath, 12, has raised £40,000 for a men's health charity this month .

"Sam Allardyce believes Manchester United have entered panic mode in the transfer market after failing to deliver signings for David Moyes last season. Moyes was sacked in April having failed to live up to the expectations at Old Trafford, and his permanent successor Louis van Gaal has since spent close to £150million on new players. And Allardyce, speaking exclusively to The Sun, sympathises with Moyes after the Scot wasn't backed with the same amount of money. Louis van Gaal has had a difficult start to his Manchester United reign after seeing his side lose to Leicester . David Moyes was replaced by Van Gaal after Allardyce insists United failed to give him the signings he needed . Angel di Maria and Falcao were marquee signings for Manchester United but they're still struggling . 'There was a complacency by United in not going out and delivering the signings David felt he needed,' the West Ham manager said. 'Now there's a panic on.' Moyes brought in Marouane Fellaini and Juan Mata over two transfer windows during his time at the club, while Angel di Maria, Ander Herrera, Luke Shaw, Marcos Rojo and even Radamel Falcao  arrived in the summer for Van Gaal. Allardyce added that Moyes wasn't able to sign the players he wanted at United, which may have affected the results on the field. 'He will obviously look at what he might have done better but he should have done better but he should have got the players he wanted and he tells me he didn't get any of them.'

"Major League Baseball umpire Dale Scott says he is gay, the latest such disclosure in sports. Scott has been a member of the big league staff since 1986 - meaning 29 seasons - and is a crew chief. He worked the World Series in 1998, 2001 and 2004. The 55-year-old told the website Outsports.com he married Michael Rausch in November 2013 and that MLB and the other umpires were aware of his sexuality. Scott said he made a deliberate decision to go public in a low-key manner. He had provided Referee magazine a photo of himself with Rausch going to last year's opening series in Sydney for an October story. The caption in the issue stated: 'He and his longtime companion, Michael Rausch, traveled to Australia for the 2014 season opener between the Diamondbacks and Dodgers.' In the game: Dale Scott, seen on June 5 calling out St. Louis Cardinals' Yadier Molina after a play review, says he is gay and that he married his longtime partner in November 2013 . Scott said in a story posted by Outsports on Tuesday that 'My thought process was, is that there's a story about my career and how I got started in umpiring and they're talking to people I have known since junior high and it didn't seem right to have a whole story and pictures without a picture of Mike and I, someone who's been with me through this entire process. We met the October after my first year in the big leagues. 'Obviously, when I sent that picture to Jeff [Stern, Referee magazine's editor], I knew exactly what it meant. In a small way, this was opening that door in a publication that wasn't going to be circulated nationwide. It could be picked up, but it's not Time magazine. I made that decision to go ahead and do it because I felt it was the right thing to do.' He continued, 'I realized that it could open a Pandora's Box, but this is not a surprise to Major League Baseball, the people I work for. It's not a surprise to the umpire staff. Until Mike and I got married last November, he was my same-sex domestic partner and had his own MLB I.D. and was on my insurance policy. 'This is not going to be some huge flashing news to Park Avenue [MLB headquarters], but I also didn't want to be making some coming out story, some banner headline, because that's not how I operate. It's not a shock to MLB management because they're well aware of my situation and it's not a shock to the umpire staff. If it would have been, I don't think I would have done it.' Tough call: Scott is seen in a dispute with Texas Rangers' Ron Washington and Gerald Laird during an August 2008 game . Scott did not hear from anyone regarding the publication of the image showing him and his husband though he received congratulatory comments for the profile, Outsports reported. According to the website, Scott and Rausch first crossed paths when they were both at the same Portland gay bar in 1986. Scott told Outsports 'It's still a headline, look at Michael Sam. People scream at me because I'm an umpire. The last thing I want is people screaming at me because I'm gay. I'm an umpire who happens to be gay. I'm not trying to be some gay person who happens to be an umpire.' Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig praised Scott. 'To his friends and colleagues throughout the game, Dale is universally regarded as a class act,' he said in a statement. 'All of us at Major League Baseball are very proud of him, just as we have always been.' Scott's decision to go public follows that of others in sports. Basketball center Jason Collins became the first openly gay player in one of the major North American professional leagues in April 2013. He announced his retirement last month at age 35. Defensive end Michael Sam, the Southeastern Conference's 2013 co-defensive player of the year, came out in February. He was drafted by the St. Louis Rams with the 249th pick in May, cut in August, signed by Dallas for its practice squad, then released by the Cowboys in October. Midfielder Robbie Rogers announced he was gay in February 2013 following his release from Leeds in England. He signed with Major League Soccer's Los Angeles Galaxy that May and has revived his career this year with a move to defender. University of Massachusetts junior guard Derrick Gordon became the first openly gay player in Division I men's basketball in April. He made his announcement on ESPN and Outsports. Other out professional players include WNBA stars Brittney Griner and Seimone Augustus and National Women's Soccer League players Abby Wambach and Megan Rapinoe.","Major League Baseball umpire Dale Scott says he is gay, the latest such disclosure in sports .

"It has been declared the world's longest pub crawl and two friends have celebrated in the appropriate way - with a pint. Peter Hill, 59, and John Drew, 61, said cheers as they stopped at their 18,000th pub after a 30-year tour and vowed to carry on boozing 'until our livers give out.' The group - who call themselves the Black Country Ale Tairsters - started visiting different watering holes in 1984 after becoming bored of always visiting the same pub. Beer-loving friends raised a toast on the weekend after visiting their 18,000th bar in world's longest pub crawl . Peter Hill is one of the founders of The Black Country Ale Tairsters (left) pictured with his mates (right) Along with friends, they have drunk in a different pub every week since then - beginning back when a pint cost just 64p. Girls are banned from tagging along with them on their trips, which have taken in bars in every county in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The gang always wear homemade uniforms on each night out made of waistcoats fashioned from old beer towels. Peter Hill (second left) and dad Joe Hill (centre in red top) in Railway Train Pub in the West Midlands in 1988 . John Drew, Joe Hill, Karl Bradley and Peter Hill visiting 8000th pub Pavilion in Birmingham in 1998 . They also hold the record for being the first to travel to pubs around the entire coastline of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Last year they completed a seven-year quest to visit every pub in Wales after stopping off at all 3,905 of them. They have also been to every boozer in 11 Midlands counties and have driven over 250,000 miles during their monster trip, during which they've downed at least 36,000 pints. But there will be one notable absentee from the celebrations after Peter's dad Joe, who had been with the pint-supping pair throughout their adventure, died in April at the age of 83. The group visited their 5000th pub in 1993 (left) and marked their landmark 10,000th visit in Birmingham in 2001 (right) The Black Country Ale Tairsters leave their calling card at every pub they visit . Founding member Peter said they came up with the idea after becoming bored with drinking in the same pub each week. Machinist Peter, his retired dad Joe and scaffolder John then decided that the 800 Banks's pubs they visited weren't enough so embarked on the challenge to conquer every pub in Wales. Speaking from the landmark 18,000th pub at The Saxon Penny in Lichfield, Staffs., Peter said: 'It's fabulous that we have made it to here. 'I think we'll stay at this pub for a while yet, but we may squeeze in number 18,001 later on this evening. 'If I had to have a beer of choice I would just ask for any real ale to be honest. It's hard to think of a hobby which is so much fun. 'We are just going to keep going until our livers give out, or at least something gives out. The Black Country Ale Tasters at Powis Arms in Pool Quay, Dorset. The group has drunk in a different boozer every week since 1984 . The world's most epic pub crawl began with this map - and the dream of visiting bars in all counties in Britain . 'Although it may be a big surprise to people, we're not massive drinkers. We just love pubs and everything about them. 'We have our own score cards which we fill in and we write the number of the pub on the card and ask the landlord to sign the book we have which has information in from every bar we go to. 'We also keep a record of the pubs we go to by taking a photo of the pub, inside and out, and make a note of anything special about the place. 'It turned from a bit of fun to a serious hobby. I'll be doing this for as long as I can - I intend to visit every pub I can. 'Although I'll soon be 60 and I wonder where all the years have gone. 'We would never live long enough to have a drink in every pub in England. It's taken us seven years to visit 3,905 pubs in Wales. 'Nowadays, I try to limit myself to 1,500 pints a year. If it's a cider and lager pub we'll just have a swift half. In 2010, The Black Country Ale Tasters marked their 15,000th pub visit at the Watermill in Kidderminster . 'In every pub, we ask for a £1 donation, with the money going to the children's ward at Sandwell Hospital.' Around 20 tipplers were originally in the group but now only two remain including Peter, from West Bromwich, West Mids. Every pub they visit is rated, photos are taken and information is noted down and Black Country Ale Tairsters (BATs) approval is a recognised accolade in the local pub trade. They have also made trips to pubs right across Europe but they say these boozers don't count because they are not in the UK. David Parsons, 67, owner of the Tame Bridge public house in Great Bridge, West Mids., which is one of the team's favourite locals, said: 'These men are incredible, they are such a presence in the pub here. 'They have changed this pub, we used to serve a lot of lager but since they started coming with the knowledge they have of real ales, we sell a lot of the stuff. 'What they don't know about beer, no one does.'","Peter Hill and John Drew marked massive milestone in their epic pub crawl .

"Mars recently played host to an Oort Cloud comet flyby, providing an unprecedented chance to expand our understanding of the solar system. Sliding Spring passed within 87,000 miles (140,000 km) of Mars, less than half the distance between Earth and its moon, and much closer than any comet has ever come to Earth. Now, Nasa has released data suggesting that the chemistry of Mars' atmosphere could be changed forever from the flyby, which only happens once every eight million years. Scroll down for video . Mars recently played host to an Oort Cloud comet flyby, providing an unprecedented chance to expand understanding of our solar system. Siding Spring passed within 87,000 miles (140,000 km) of Mars (artist's impression pictured in a flyby which only happens once every eight million years . The comet's dust likely produced a meteor shower when particles hit it the upper atmosphere, 'literally changing the chemistry,' said Jim Green, director of Nasa's planetary science division. As well as adding a new layer of ions to the Mars atmosphere, the speeding comet - which travelled at 35 miles per second (56km per second) - produced what was described as a meteor storm. Experts describe the scene, with thousands of shooting stars per hour and the entire sky changing colour as 'mind blowing'. 'It's extremely rare in human history. It would have been truly stunning to the human eye,' said planetary scientist Nick Schneider, with the University of Colorado in Boulder. The comet's dust produced a meteor shower when particles hit it the upper atmosphere, 'literally changed the chemistry,' said Jim Green, director of Nasa's planetary science division (artist's impression pictured) Comet Siding Spring comes from the Oort Cloud, material left over from the formation of the solar system. 'This comet is coming into the solar system straight from the Oort Cloud. It's likely this is its first time this close to the sun,' said space scientist David Humm, of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Maryland. Oort Cloud material, including comets, is scattered through a vast region that begins outside the orbits of Neptune and Pluto and extends a substantial fraction of the distance to Proxima Centauri, the closest neighboring star. Oort Cloud comets can tell scientists about the materials - including water and carbon compounds - that existed during the formation of the solar system some 4.6 billion years ago. The images above show - before and after filtering - comet C/2013 A1, also known as Siding Spring, as captured by Wide Field Camera 3 on NASA's Hubble Space Telescope . Studying this close encounter was the largest fleet of orbiting scientific observatories ever flown to another world, orbiting around (and rolling on the ground of) Mars. These instruments will, for the first time ever, have the chance to make close-up observations of a comet new to the inner solar system. And though it will not be the easiest task, the teams operating these instruments and spacecraft have developed plans to take advantage of this rare opportunity. Siding Spring is small (the nucleus is less than a mile in diameter) and fast (it passed Mars at about 34 miles/55 kilometres per second). The instruments on various spacecraft observed the comet repeatedly for two and a half days as it got closer and closer to Mars before it made its closest approach. The peak density of comet dust at Mars was expected 98 minutes after closest approach of the nucleus. This graphic shows the science observations that was hoped to be captured by Nasa's Mars spacecraft during the close encounter with Comet Siding Spring (C/2013 A1) Although the comet eventually left Mars far behind, its impact could have long-standing effects on the planet, claims Elizabeth Howell in Universe Today. Instruments on Maven detected eight different types of metal ions in the comet dust: sodium, magnesium, potassium, chromium, manganese, iron, nickel, and zinc. Nasa says that eventually these metals will revert to dust in a process known as meteoric smoke. The introduction of all of this new dust into the Mars atmosphere may produce high-altitude clouds above the planet's surface and could affect its interaction with sunlight. These images were taken of comet C/2013 A1 Siding Spring by Nasa's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter on 19 October 2014 during the comet's close flyby of Mars and the spacecraft. It is the highest-resolution image of a comet that heralds from the Oort Cloud at the edge of the solar system ever taken . As well as this, the chemistry of the atmosphere might be permanently altered. The comet was a rare visitor from the Oort Cloud, a spherically shaped reservoir beyond Neptune's orbit containing leftovers from the formation of the solar system some 4.6 billion years ago. The interest in examining the properties of the comet dust doesn't end with its effects on Mars. 'We believe that comets were formed very early, much earlier than the Earth was,' Mr Green said. Studying Siding Spring may offer unique insight into the content of the collapsing cloud that formed the solar system, he said. This image of Comet Siding Spring was taken by astronomers Nick Howes and Ron Wodaski using the Tzec Muan Observatory in Australia. The comet is the blue-ish object towards the middle of the picture, with its tail seen streaking backwards. Mars is the bright sun-like object in the middle, overexposed to reveal the comet .","Mars played host to extremely rare Oort Cloud comet flyby in October .

"A dangerous strain of E.coli has led to at least two children needing dialysis in hospital – and left angry parents asking why authorities failed to sound the alert early enough. The rare form of the bacteria, apparently originating in Dorset, has struck 11 people, including five children, with seven developing kidney problems which could be permanent. One three-year-old girl, from Blandford in the county, is battling the infection in hospital after being struck down last week. Scroll down for video . Freddy Osborne, one, was rushed to hospital with E. coli after eating at Frankie & Benny's in Castlepoint, Bournemouth - but the restaurant has been given the all clear . Several victims were associated with a children’s nursery. Yet while the outbreak began in July, Public Health England (PHE) only began raising any alarm this week. It is yet to identify the source of the potentially fatal infection of E.coli 055 but has ruled out a Bournemouth branch of restaurant chain Frankie and Benny’s where three victims dined in two separate groups before being struck down. Yesterday, PHE contacted the families of all the victims asking relatives to give blood tests in an attempt to establish the origin of the outbreak. One of those who needed dialysis is Freddy Osborne, now 21 months. Isaac Mortlock, three, also fell ill with E. coli after eating at the same Frankie & Benny's restaurant, which has been cleared of any blame by investigators . Isaac's mother Gabrielle Archer (pictured) also feared her son could die after finding him fitting in the middle of the night . He spent four weeks in Southampton General Hospital, much of it in intensive care, and required multiple blood transfusions. He was at one stage left blind for ten days and had to be put into a coma for six days because it was dangerous for him to try to breathe. Although Freddy survived the ordeal, he was left blind for 10 days and his kidneys may never work properly again . Eventually he was diagnosed with the E.coli 055 strain, although all the diagnoses took a long time because the strain has never been found since records began in 1994. Freddy’s mother Charlotte Fudge, 25, from Bournemouth, said: ‘The whole family thought he was going to die. He was totally traumatised and went through hell. It is ridiculous Public Health England didn’t warn people what was going on and work harder to find the source.’ Gabrielle Archer’s son Isaac, three, was in the same hospital as Freddy, also needing dialysis and spending time in intensive care. He is now home after nine weeks in two hospitals but is still on a nasal drip and has permanently damaged kidneys. The family fear he may be in need of a kidney transplant. Miss Archer, 26, from Bournemouth, said: ‘The day after Isaac’s birthday in July he suddenly got very ill. First he was sick. Then he began passing blood. ‘At first doctors told us it was probably gastroenteritis. It was only when he started leaking blood permanently they said they’d have to admit him to hospital. Then he got violently sick – and an X-ray and scan showed his kidneys were affected and he had to go on dialysis. He had to be switched to another hospital in Southampton and stay there for five weeks. ‘He had fits in the middle of one night as well, his eyes were rolling, I thought he was dying, and I was screaming ‘‘Won’t someone help my baby?” He was unrecognisable.’ Freddy, now two, was the first to pick up the rare strain of E. coli that has hospitalised 11 people in Dorset since July . Isaac’s aunt, Jessica Archer, was then struck down by the same strain of E.coli and was hospitalised. Miss Archer is angry that PHE did not start publicising the outbreak until this week. She said: ‘I’m devastated that other children are now suffering – and feel that had Public Health England taken Isaac’s case more seriously in the first place, and put out more warnings, fewer people could have been affected.’ A spokesman for PHE said that the people affected by the strain had been struck over a lengthy period, and that while all had passed through Dorset, not all were from there, so it took some time to pull the facts together. She said: ‘All those affected and their close contacts are being followed up and further investigations are taking place to determine the likely source.’ Cleared: Three people who have fallen ill with E. coli ate at Frankie & Benny's before they were hospitalised, but the restaurant has been given a clean bill of health . Escherichia coli or E.coli, is a group of bacteria that live in the intestines of animals and humans. Many strains are harmless, but some can cause serious health problems. About 35,000 people are struck down by different forms of E.coli infection every year. Many cases are mild, such as urinary tract infections, but 1,000 a year are hit by E.coli food poisoning which can be very serious, particularly to children and the elderly. The most common serious E.coli strain in Britain is O157. Symptoms include severe diarrhoea, stomach cramps and fever. Infections can cause serious complications such as potentially fatal kidney problems or brain damage. The bug releases toxins which can affect blood vessels – leading to fits and attacking the kidneys. It may also harm the heart. Infection is spread by consuming food or water contaminated with the bacteria, or through contact with infected people or farm animals. A severe outbreak at a petting farm in Surrey affected 76 young children in 2009, ten of them suffering long-term effects. The UK’s largest E.coli food poisoning outbreak killed 21 people in Lanarkshire in 1996.","Two children fell ill with E. coli after eating at Frankie & Benny's restaurant .

Pizza Hut's subconscious menu reads the minds of diners by using sophisticated eye tracking technology . Taking six months to build, the menu is completely controlled by the customer's retina. The four-step process starts when the software detects the users retina and gaze by asking customers to randomly look at different circles. Eye movements are tracked against the small marks on the screen. The software then detects the gaze of the user by changing the logos on the interface from big to small. This is then followed by ingredients tracking, where the user is given three seconds to look at 20 ingredients on the screen. The algorithm then kicks in and the  menu identifies the perfect pizza based on which ingredients the user has been looking at the longest.

"A British jihadi fighting for the Islamic State in Syria has been showing off his rapping skills on Twitter - urging his followers to stop playing video games and devote their lives to terrorism instead. Peppering his bizarre schoolboy rhymes with UK street slang and references to popular Western culture, Abu Qaqa al-Britani Afro's page is filled with references to life in ISIS' de facto capital Raqqa, where he says 'death is near' but he claims to 'show no fear'. Declaring himself to be a 'poet', al-Britani Afro also hints at a past life as a drug dealer in the UK, saying: 'Not many seen wat I have seen... Used to be on the street like a vending machine [sic]'. It is thought that al-Britani Afro - who has also used the nom de guerre Abu Qaqa al-Afreeki in an apparent nod to his African descent - is in his early 20s and first arrived in Syria earlier this year. Militant: Abu Qaqa al-Britani Afro, whose real identity is not known, regularly posts 'selfies' on Twitter showing him wearing a floppy floppy fisherman hat, a balaclava and glasses in the majority of his pictures . Al-Britani Afro peppers his schoolboy rhymes with UK street slang and references to popular Western culture . Rapper: Each of the militant's simplistic rhymes draws a string of positive comments from the 500 people following him on Twitter - suggesting his bizarre rhymes are held in high regard by ISIS supporters . Al-Britani Afro, whose real identity is not known, regularly posts 'selfies' on Twitter showing him wearing a floppy fisherman hat, a balaclava and glasses in the majority of his pictures. Posing with AK47 assault rifles resting between his arms, the rapping jihadi also dresses in light Western-style rain jackets, rather than the heavy combat gear his fellow militants typically wear. However it is in his bizarre rhymes celebrating ISIS' brutal interpretation of extremist Islam that Al-Britani Afro truly betrays his Western upbringing. 'Call of Duty Drop the Fifa and come give bayeh to the Khalifah,' he writes in one message urging his followers to stop playing popular video games and declare to their allegiance to the leader of the terror group Abu Bakr as-Baghdadi. Another message trumpeted the recent sickening filmed beheading of 16 Syrian soldiers by a band of ISIS killers including the groups British chief executioner 'Jihadi John'. 'That video was epic / Head chopped of no need for the medic / Fake Scholar all apologetic / So pathetic / Remember to kuffar [non-Muslims] we ain't sympathetic,' he wrote . Each of the militant's simplistic rhymes draws a string of positive comments from the 500 people following him on Twitter - suggesting his bizarre rhymes are held in high regard by ISIS supporters. Armed: Abu Qaqa al-Britani Afro first emerged on Twitter in mid-October 2014, using the now suspended twitter handle, @BritaniQaqa. He is understood to have arrived in Syria a short time before . Following the suspension of his first Twitter account, al-Britani Afro  created a second profile @AbuQaqaBrit . Self-declared poet: Abu Qaqa al-Britani Afro's page is filled with references to life in ISIS' de facto capital Raqqa, where he says 'death is near' but he claims to 'show no fear' Al-Britani Afro first emerged on Twitter in mid-October 2014, using the now suspended twitter handle, @BritaniQaqa. One of his fellow British ISIS fighters, Abu 3antarr al-Britani, was among the first to raise awareness of Abu Qaqa's account. 'Everybody follow my brother @BritaniQaqa, he is new on Twitter. He is in dawla [ISIS-held areas of Syria and Iraq]. He is radicalised and he is armed.' Following the suspension of his first Twitter account, Abu Qaqa hastily created a second profile. Again, Abu 3antar, was quick to promote the extremists' latest Twitter page, writing that 'his rhymes are affecting the kuffar [non-Muslims], so support him.' The close online relationship between the pair suggests they may well be stationed together in the group's de facto capital city Raqqa. Horror: One Twitter message trumpeted the recent sickening filmed beheading of 16 Syrian soldiers by a band of ISIS killers including the groups British chief executioner 'Jihadi John' Al-Britani Afro, who also uses the name 'Greenbird Express', has recently been tweeting about the airstrikes being carried out on Raqqa by the Assad regime. He urges his followers to pray 'nothing happens to our women and children' in Raqqa but insists his own safety is of little concern. 'This is the life I choose / None can oppose / Trapped in the Dunya [on Earth] trying to perfect my flows / The cursed one, I don't want to be one of those,' he recently wrote. Al-Britani Afro also repeatedly expresses a desire to die fighting for ISIS, continually expressing his warped belief that killing in the name of Islam will somehow lead him to heaven. 'Upgrade your stature / Hijra is the starter/ Die as a martyr/ Green bird that's another chapter,' he writes, going on to say that he hopes to be reincarnated as a green bird in the afterlife. Rapping jihadis: Al-Britani Afro is not the only ISIS militant to express extremist views. Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary (left) - the Londoner once suspected of being Jihadi John - was an aspiring rapper who appeared on Radio One before joining ISIS. German jihadi Denis Cusper (right) - was also once a successful rapper . Dangerous: Performing under the name Deso Dogg, Cusper gave up his music after embracing radical Isla, adopting the nom de guerre Abu Talha al-Almani and travelling to join ISIS in Syria (pictured) Jihadi poetry has a long history in the Islamic world. Details on the lives of militants known as the Mujahideen during the 1979 Afghan war, were often recorded through poems . Many of these rhymes feature elaborate musings on what the fighters expects to be met with in the afterlife. They were typically written during the quieter moments of the conflict with the Soviet Union. Osama bin Laden was well known for his poetry on jihad. His verses described the thrill of battles and the companionship of his fellow fighters. Al-Britani Afro is not the only ISIS militant to use rap as a means to express extremist views. Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary - the Londoner who was once suspected of being Jihadi John until security officials ruled him out - was an aspiring rapper who appeared on Radio One before swapping the microphone for an AK47. Formerly known by his stage name, L Jinny one of Bary's friends was previously quited as saying: 'He had the talent - he could have been as big as Dizzee Rascal.' Likewise German fighter Denis Cusper - who was recently shown beheading an Iraqi tribesmen in another sickening ISIS murder film - was also once a successful hip hop artist. Performing under the name Deso Dogg, Cusper gave up his music after embracing radical Isla, adopting the nom de guerre Abu Talha al-Almani and travelling to join ISIS in Syria.","Militant Abu Qaqa al-Britani Afro uses rap to express his extremist views .

"The families of two babies who spent the first 10 years of their lives  with the wrong mothers after they were mistakenly switched at birth are suing the French maternity clinic responsible for nearly £10million. The blunder occurred 20 years ago when Sophie Serrano - now 38 - and another unnamed mother gave birth to daughters at a clinic in the French Riviera resort of Cannes, near Grasse. Mrs Serrano's baby girl Manon suffered from jaundice and doctors put her in an incubator equipped with lights to treat the problem along with another affected newborn girl. Scroll down for video . Sophie Serrano outside court with her non-biological daughter Manon who was mistakenly given to her at birth after a mix-up at a French maternity clinic 20 years ago. She and another unnamed mother who gave birth to Manon and was handed Mrs Serrano's biological daughter in the blunder are suing the clinic for £10m . An auxiliary nurse unwittingly switched them, and although both mothers immediately expressed doubt about the babies, pointing to their different hair lengths, they were sent home anyway. Ten years later, troubled by the fact his daughter bore no resemblance to him with her darker skin, Manon's father did a paternity test that revealed he was not her biological parent. Sophie Serrano then discovered she was not Manon's mother either, prompting a probe to try and find the other family who had been handed their biological daughter. When they were located, it transpired that the daughters had grown up just 18 miles apart. The other family involved in the case also attended Tuesday's closed-doors hearing, but opted to remain anonymous. Emotional: Manon Serrano wipes away tears as she speaks to media outside court after the damages hearing . The investigation revealed that at the time of the births in 1994, three newborns suffered from jaundice - the two girls and a boy - and the clinic only had two incubators with the special lights. The girls were therefore put together in one incubator, according to the lawyer of one of the obstetricians being sued. Another obstetrician, two paediatricians, the clinic and an auxiliary nurse are also being sued. 'If it happened to us, it may have happened to others,' Sophie Serrano said after the hearing, holding the hand of her non-biological daughter Manon. 'There should be exemplary sentences.... we really hope to get this recognition, so as to free us from all this guilt about not having been able to protect your kid, not having insisted when we saw there was a problem.' Manon Serrano (right) and her mother Sophie Serrano embrace a relative as they leave Grasse courthouse . For her part, Manon said she was shocked over accusations levelled in court blaming the mothers for not having recognised their children. 'She protested, she found herself in front of a qualified nurse, she was very young, she had just had a child, so putting the blame on her is absurd, I find that inhuman,' she said. The two sets of parents met their biological daughters for the first time when they were both 10 years old, but did not ask that they be switched back. 'It was a pretty disturbing moment, very bizarre,' said Manon. 'You find yourself in front of a woman who is biologically your mother but who is a stranger.' The two families have distanced themselves from each other since the meeting 10 years ago. It's too difficult, so we each went our separate ways as it's so distressing, it was the only way to find some stability again,' said Sophie Serrano. The court will rule on the case on February 10. The clinic has admitted fault - blaming what happened on the nursing auxiliary whom it claims suffered from alcoholism - but has insisted it will not pay any damages.","Babies born to Sophie Serrano and an unnamed French mother in 1994 .

"A woman has become an internet sensation after appearing in a series of hilarious poses on eBay selling her deliberately 'ugly' Christmas jumpers. Deb Rottum, 45, from Tampa in Florida, spends hours painstakingly turning second-hand sweaters into 'hideous' festive creations by sewing on tinsel, bells and even cuddly toys. And whenever the mother-of-three updates her eBay store 'Deb's Handmade Ugly Tacky Christmas Sweaters' she poses in the new addition. Scroll down for video . Quirky: Ms Rottum's 'ugly' Christmas jumpers have become a huge hit - despite their quirky looks . But while the jumpers have proved a hit, it is the semi-terrified facial expression and wooden pose adopted in all the photos that have turned Ms Rottum's business into a smash-hit success. Indeed, so popular has Ms Rottum become, she is now toying with setting up her own ugly jumper factory in order to meet demand. Ms Rottum, who first hit upon the idea of flogging awful Christmas jumpers last year, said: 'People host 'Tacky Christmas Sweater' parties every Christmas. ""I've always been quite creative, so one year I thought I'd give it a go and everybody said mine was the tackiest - it was quite a compliment. 'Some people and businesses even have competitions to find the most tasteless jumpers, which is why I think my creations are so popular. 'I know it's a cheating a bit if someone wins by wearing one of my creations, but I don't mind - I like knowing I'm the best at making something so ugly.' Ms Rottum sells her hideous creations for up to £50, and is struggling to keep up with orders because she can only make two in an evening. Toned down: Not every jumper is festooned with tinsel - this red number is relatively toned down and stylish . 'I go through thrift stores and charity shops, as well as boot sales and craft fairs, just to get as much festive rubbish as possible to sew onto the jumpers,' she explains. ""Last year someone saw one of my jumpers and asked where they could buy one. It was a lightbulb moment - I couldn't believe anybody would actually pay for them, so I started making them as fast as I could. 'I sold about 30 for Christmas 2013, but I had supply issues because I didn't really know where to go to get the raw materials.Now I know where to get them from, so I can make a couple every night. 'I've probably made about 200 jumpers this year so far, and I've got another couple of hundred orders to get made before Christmas.' She added: 'Santa has his elves, and I'm seriously considering opening my own factory.' All the trimmings: Ms Rottum scours thrift stores for old bits of tinsel and baubles to use for decoration . Unique: Each jumper is handmade and totally unique. Ms Rottum also takes commissions . Busy: So popular have Ms Rottum's quirky designs proved, she is even contemplating setting up a factory . Massive teddy bears, penguins, moose, polar bears and even a Christmas monkey are among the most popular designs - even if they are, as Ms Rottum admits, in questionable taste. 'I just try and come up with something that's themed, even if the theme is 'ugly,' she explained. 'They're quite clearly not in the best taste, but they certainly serve a purpose, and also nobody can see them and not get in the mood for Christmas.' The budding designer also opened up about her signature pose, which involves wide eyes and a toothy grimace-like smile, while standing with her arms by her sides and clenched fists pointing at the ground. 'I don't pose like that because I have a gun pointed at me, that's for sure,' she revealed. 'I stand like that so people can see the detail on the arms. 'I am purposely smiling big and making my eyes look crazy because these are crazy sweaters. I'm not terrified, I promise.' Ms Rottum, who is willing to ship her incredibly hideous jumpers all over the world, also does commissions, and has even made a sweater for an British girl that is covered in skunks. Signature: All of Ms Rottum's designs are sold on eBay and she models the jumpers on every listing herself . Terrified: Ms Rottum has developed a signature pose, complete with wide-eyes and a rigid stance .","Deb Rottum, 45, from Tampa in Florida, has become an internet sensation .

"President Barack Obama met with controversial black pastor Rev. Al Sharpton on Monday at the White House, amid word that he would demand $263 million from Congress to put 50,000 body-worn cameras in U.S. police departments and train local cops to better use surplus military equipment. The moves came in response to the  police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. Sharpton called the get-together 'a historic meeting that the president and vice president sat with all of us and law enforcement to commit to not just another commitment, another study ... but that he would put his full weight behind it.' 'We live in a country that we must support law enforcement but law enforcement must support justice,' he said. In a brief statement to the press, Obama said that the Brown shooting in Ferguson 'laid bare a problem that is not unique to St. Louis ... and that is a simmering distrust that exists between too many police departments and too many communities of color.' 'He cited civil rights leaders' opinion 'that in a country where one of our basic principles, perhaps the most important principle, is equality under the law, that too many individuals – particularly young people of color – do not feel as if they're being treated fairly.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . President Barack Obama had a full plate on Monday with three separate Ferguson-related meetings, including one with elected officials, community organizers and religious leaders . Rev. Al Sharpton spoke Sunday during a church service in the parking lot at The Flood Christian Church, a house of worship that rioters burned last week in the wake of a grand jury's decision not to indict a white police officer in the shooting death of a black man . ALREADY THERE? Members of the Ferguson, MIssouri Police Department wore body cameras during an August 30 rally . Brown's parents have pushed body-worn cameras as one way to limit distrust between police and criminal suspects following physical encounters. The White House said in August that it agreed with the idea in principle. 'We support the use of cameras and video technology by law enforcement officers, and the Department of Justice continues to research best practices for implementation,' the administration wrote in response to a public petition that attracted more than 154,000 supporters on the White House website. The new initiative will provide 50 per cent of the funding for cameras, but will not pay for them entirely, at a cost of $75 million. It will also provide new training resources and funds to study how to reform police practices. It's unclear why Officer Darren Wilson didn't wear a camera during his fateful encounter with Brown. Members of the Ferguson Police Department were photographed wearing body cameras later that month during an August 30 rally. Obama has a jam-packed day with three separate meetings to discuss the deteriorating situation. He also announced Monday that he wants the Pentagon and Congress to review the program that puts surplus military hardware in the hands of state and local law enforcement. The White House is pushing a new torrent of public messages about the death of Brown, a young black man, at the hands of Wilson, a white officer. Meetings with cabinet officials, with a group of 'young local and national civil rights leaders,' and with top law enforcement officials are on the president's official Monday schedule. Speculation ran rampant on Twitter that Sharpton would attend the civil rights meeting, and his representatives confirmed it just before lunch. Sharpton, a community-organizer-turned-minister-turned-TV-host, is a frequent White House visitor and has appeared in Ferguson. On Sunday he preached at the St. Louis church where Michael Brown's funeral service was held. 'The fight ain't over,' he told a capacity crowd. Alicia Garza, a special projects director at the National Domestic Workers Alliance and a co-founder of the emblematic 'Black Lives Matter' movement, tweeted a cautionary note. 'Obama – meeting with Al Sharpton isn't what's going to change conditions. Those days are LONG GONE,' she wrote. Paramilitary: Police in the war-torn Missouri suburb of Ferguson , like many local forces large and small, participates in a federal program that arms them with surplus battlefield weapons, armor and combat vehicles . Missouri Lt. Gov Peter Kinder said Monday morning on the Fox News Channel that Sharpton 'is an inciter of mobs and he demands mob justice.' The Pentagon program that supplies military equipment to police forces has moved more than $5.1 billion in gear – including guns, tactical vehicles and even aircraft – since its inception. About $500 million in hardware was passed out this year alone. But White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest explained during a briefing Monday that 'the ‘majority of the funds’ spent through those programs ‘has not been used to purchase law enforcement specific equipment’. He characterized it instead as largely a source for office supplies and other materials that can help a police department run smoothly. Earnest told reporters that the program should be tweaked to 'enhance crime prevention while at the same time strengthening the bonds with the communities they are sworn to protect.' He said the president had no plans to visit Ferguson personally but hadn't ruled it out. Black communities, especially in Ferguson, have complained that the federal government is arming their local police to the point where they more resemble paramilitary armies than law enforcement agencies. But on the nights following a grand jury's decision not to indict Officer Wilson, rioters burned buildings and looted stores while shots rang out. Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon was criticized later for not deploying the Missouri National Guard, a fully militarized force, in downtown Ferguson. Obama said during an August 18 press conference that it would be 'useful for us to review how the funding was done, how local law enforcement has used grant dollars, to make sure that what they're purchasing is stuff that they actually need.' 'There is a big difference between our military and our local law enforcement, and we don't want those lines blurred. That would be contrary to our tradition,' he said then. Earnest said Monday that the president would appoint a new task force, led by Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey and former assistant Attorney General Laurie Robinson, to study what the White House has called 'best practices' in policing. That task force will have 120 days to report back to the White House. Its work is expected to focus on alleged disparities between the treatment of blacks and whites at the hands of sworn officers. Military weapons and armor have crossed over from Army bases to police barracks tens of thousands of times in the last seven years, including firearms and anti-ambush vehicles . The White House said in a statement that the president's cabinet meeting would concern 'federal programs and funding that provide equipment to state and local law enforcement agencies.' But it did not respond to a request for information about who else, other than Sharpton, would attend its civil rights meeting. The Associated Press reported that Obama's meeting with the civil rights community would focus on challenges posed by 'mistrust between law enforcement and communities of color.' That topic was a major point of emphasis when the president addressed the nation one week ago as Ferguson burned. 'The fact is, in too many parts of this country, a deep distrust exists between law enforcement and communities of color,' Obama said on Nov. 24. 'Some of this is the result of the legacy of racial discrimination in this country. And this is tragic, because nobody needs good policing more than poor communities with higher crime rates.' 'The good news is we know there are things we can do to help,' he added. 'And I've instructed Attorney General [Eric] Holder to work with cities across the country to help build better relations between communities and law enforcement.' Earnest said Monday that it's ‘an unfortunate irony that in those communities where the crime rate is the highest, sometimes the trust is lowest between the members of the community and the police force.’ Michael Brown Sr., left, and his wife, Calvina Brown, right, attended a Flood Christian Church service on Sunday in a tent. The church was torched during riots last week. Sharpton preached at the service. Protests have continued in Ferguson, but have been more muted than the violence sparked last week by a grand jury's decision not to indict police officer Darren Wilson in the shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown after he held up a convenience store. Wilson resigned his post over the weekend. Obama's cabinet meeting concerned 'federal programs and funding that provide equipment to state and local law enforcement agencies,' according to the White House. That has been a front-burner issue since the Ferguson shooting in August, when police showed up in force in military-style vehicles that the Obama and Bush administrations provided through programs that distribute surplus Pentagon equipment.","Slain 18-year-old Michael Brown's parents have demanded the use of more body-cams by police forces to document violent encounters with suspects .

"David Prowse, who played Darth Vader in the first three Star Wars films, said his dementia would now let him down and would probably forget his lines . Former Darth Vader actor David Prowse has said he would loved to have been involved in the new Star Wars movie, but fears his dementia would let him down. An 88-second sneak preview for the new film, Star Wars: The Force Awakens, was released online yesterday and has already been viewed more than 15million times. But Mr Prowse, who played Lord Vader from 1977 to 1983, said he was disappointed he will not be able to play any part in the latest movie. The 79-year-old, who lives in Croydon, South London, told the Daily Mirror: 'It wouldn't have mattered what it was, I would have loved to have done something in it - even if it was just a cameo.' Diagnosed with dementia this summer, he began taking medication in recent weeks. 'Sometimes I can't remember things I did yesterday. That worries me more than not remembering something 20 years ago.' Mr Prowse, who appeared in Star Wars, the Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, added: 'Now I would probably forget my lines.' In the films, his voice was over-dubbed by actor James Earl James and the fight scenes were done by British Olympic swordsman Bob Anderson. Mr Prowse in a scene from the hugely popular Star Wars 1977 film - he was voiced over by James Earl Jones . Despite his Star Wars setback, Mr Prowse has come out of retirement to play safety superhero the Green Cross Code Man . In the role, he will reinforce the mantra he drummed through the 1970s and 1980s: 'Stop, look, listen, think.' Mr Prowse, a married father of three who is also celebrated for his role as Darth Vader in Star Wars, was made an MBE by the Queen in 2000 for his contribution to road safety. Deaths and injuries involving children dropped dramatically during the campaign, sponsored by the Department of Transport, which began in 1971. Now it is hoped the online 21st century version, sponsored by MORE TH>N insurance, will have similar benefits for grown-ups. The actor revealed he still owns his trusty Droid, a small robot that helped him underline the original road safety message. Elsewhere he has made a comeback as the Green Cross Man after 40 years for a new safety campaign . He played the safety superhero in the 1970s and 80s - deaths and injuries involving children dropped dramatically during the campaign, sponsored by the Department of Transport . The Force Awakens is the seventh film in the Star Wars franchise and the first of a new trilogy of sequels. The film, which reunites original stars Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher is scheduled to be released in cinemas on 18 December 2015. The new film is set 30 years after the end of Episode VI, Return of the Jedi. It brings back original Star Wars characters Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and Princess Leia, which is sure to please some life-long fans of the films .","79-year-old actor David Prowse played Darth Vader from 1977 to 1983 .

"Louis van Gaal is insistent that despite the influx of foreign players at Old Trafford this summer, everyone at the club must speak English.

'We are only two weeks in this country because we were in the USA and after that we had the international week. But I can speak Spanish so it is better to communicate sometimes on the pitch in Spanish. Van Gaal speaks Spanish himself but is keen for English to be the dressing room's language . 'But they shall learn English within one year, I promise.' United's Spanish speakers could be helped in their quest to learn the new language by Colombian striker Falcao, who speaks good English, and impressed Van Gaal at his unveiling when he spoke the language with barely any need for an interpreter.

"The famous 'Naked Gardeners' who created their very own Garden of Eden around a country manor are selling up after 'Eve' filed for divorce on the grounds her husband is a 'womanising alcoholic', it was revealed today. Barbara Pollard walked out on husband Ian after five years of marriage, leading to fears the beautiful garden they created together in Malmesbury, Wiltshire could be closed to the public and become overgrown. Mrs Pollard first suggested a divorce just a few months after she was married to Mr Pollard, he claimed today, but the couple made a go of things until she moved out three months ago and accused him of being a 'womanising alcoholic' in divorce papers. Naked gardeners Ian and Barbara Pollard found fame after taking over Abbey House Gardens in Malmesbury, Wiltshire and transforming the manor's gardens to attract visitors . But the couple are now selling the estate following Mrs Pollard's decision to file for divorce after five years of marriage and 20 years living at the property together . The couple met when she went to work . at his Wiltshire-based property development company 30 years ago, after . his first wife declared their marriage was over. They . bought picturesque Abbey House from a group of nuns in 1994 and spent . four years transforming the home and gardens, before opening the grounds . to the public. They got . married five years ago after Mr Pollard was told he might not survive an . operation to replace a defective aortic valve in his heart. He pulled through but said his new wife . soon spoke of divorce and has now accused him of being a womaniser who . drinks too much, claims he denies. The couple rose to fame in the 1990s when TV programmes were made about the thousands of nudist visitors who flocked to their manor and its beautiful gardens . The couple wrap up in fur while showing off their book - The Naked Gardeners . Speaking today, Mr Pollard said: 'Eleven weeks after we got married Barbara suggested that maybe it would be a good idea if we had a controlled separation and divorce - that was the first suggestion for it. I don't know what brought that thing on.' He said Mrs Pollard soon moved into another area of the house but the marriage continued until last July when she attended a course at Glastonbury on 'family healing'. He added: 'After coming back she walked out on me, the three kids - who are 18, 22, and 27 - and her own mother, who is 89 and lives in a flat upstairs.' According to Mr Pollard, his wife filed for divorce three months ago, but then moved back to the 12-bedroom property ten days ago when the lease on her rented home ran out. When asked the reason for the split, . he said: 'I'm a womanising alcoholic [according to divorce papers]. To . all parties concerned it is ""where the hell did she dream that one up"". 'To . call me a womaniser is ludicrous. Also an alcoholic - I like drinking . like 80 or 90 per cent of the country. Her idea is that you shouldn't . drink at all, you should abstain from alcohol completely. 'She also said I left the marital bed, but she was the one that moved.' Mr . Pollard said he did not want to sell the home, but could not afford to . buy out her share of the property, which is expected to go for 'quite a . lot' in the coming weeks. Mr Pollard says he feels bound to explain the reasons behind the sale as it will affect the local economy in  Malmesbury, Wilstshire . Mr Pollard says his estate has seen visitor numbers soar to the are off the back of the garden's popularity . In a statement, Mrs Pollard said: 'All I can say is that Ian and I are very different people but with common interests. We have brought different skills to the development of Abbey House and its gardens, which it has been a privilege to participate in. 'However I am not getting any younger, I will not last forever and I believe it is time to let someone else create a new chapter here. I wish to continue my interest in gardening, approach it in a different way and grow food among the flowers.' Abbey House Gardens has attracted nearly half a million visitors since it opened its doors in 1998. The building - parts of which date back to Saxon times - became a home for the couple and their three children and made them one of Britain's most famous nudist couples. The couple's fame grew when they later unearthed the skeleton of a 12th century monk in the tulip beds. But . after just five years of marriage, Mrs Pollard recently left and the . home and gardens are now set to go on the market in the coming weeks. The . pending sale is likely to spell the end of the road for the medieval . town's naked tourists and locals fear the treasured garden could be shut . to the public. Mr Pollard . added: 'As well as the personal issues, there is an added impact on the . gardens and the town, so I believe people deserve an explanation. 'We have 20 people here who are either employed or volunteer, and Abbey House Gardens are a big draw for the town. Locals now fear the lovingly looked-after gardens may be closed off to the public or allowed to go back to their former overgrown state . The beautiful tulip borders to the some of the garden's lawns are among the many wonderful features which have attracted so many visitors . 'The house and the gardens will be going on the market in the next few weeks but we have agreed that any sale will not impact on this season, so we will stay open until October as usual. 'But there will obviously be no guarantee that whoever buys Abbey House will want to keep it open. 'We are constantly described by visitors as being much better than Hidcote or Highgrove or Sittinghurst, and some describe us as one of the best gardens in the world. 'It would be lovely if they did see that they could open up the gardens to the public and get an income which covers the expenses of keeping the garden, but who knows?' Malmesbury's mayor Sue Poole appealed for any prospective buyer to keep the gardens open. 'Abbey House Gardens are very important to the town and has brought in a lot of people to Malmesbury. It has put the town on the map,' she said. 'People come to the tourist information centre and the town hall and ask 'where are the Naked Gardeners' and it will be a very sad loss to Malmesbury.'","Ian and Barbara Pollard took over Abbey House Gardens in Wiltshire .

"When Chloe Valentine's teenage mother was punched in the face by a partner while holding her infant daughter, little Chloe didn't cry. By then, she had become used to such violence. As the first phase of an inquest into the Adelaide girl's death drew to a close on Friday, there could be no doubt Chloe's short life was also marred by appalling squalor and neglect. Government agency Families SA considered her to be at risk even before she was born and had received multiple calls about the girl by the time she was six weeks old. After 20 notifications were made to the child protection agency about Chloe's care, she was never removed from her drug-using mother, Ashlee Polkinghorne. Chloe was four years old when she died of massive head injuries in January 2012 after being forced to ride a motorbike and repeatedly crashed over a three-day period in her Adelaide backyard. Scroll down for video . Chloe Valentine was just four when she died of massive head injuries in January 2012 . The inquest has focused on the heavy involvement of Families SA and other child welfare agencies throughout most of Chloe's life and their efforts to protect the girl. Evidence has revealed how Polkinghorne, described by one concerned friend as a very convincing liar, was often given the benefit of the doubt by social workers, who helped clean her house and avoided confronting the teenager about her drug use. One of the squalid residences she and Chloe occupied was reportedly infested with rats, while another was littered with soiled nappies and rotting food. It was alleged Chloe was also left for days on end with Polkinghorne's teenage friends. The reaction of State Coroner Mark Johns and his counsel to the evidence was one of disbelief. Social worker Nicholas Ratsch told the inquest he helped Polkinghorne draft a safety plan in late 2007 to make sure infant Chloe received proper care when her mother was affected by drugs. Polkinghorne, who was 16 at the time, agreed that whenever she and her then-partner were out of it there would be a sober person at home. The strategy replaced a previous agreement, brokered by case workers, in which Polkinghorne pledged to cease all drug-taking. An inquest into Chloe's death heard that social workers knew that her mother, drug user Ashley Polkinghorne, was neglecting her daughter from 18-months-old . The coroner questioned why Mr Ratsch would muddy the waters, saying the new plan had effectively condoned Polkinghorne's drug use. 'It doesn't in any way start with discouragement not to use drugs, does it?' Mr Johns asked. 'It's almost implicit that they will use drugs.' Another social worker, Leanne Stewart, told the inquest Polkinghorne was 'just a teenager' who found it difficult to prioritise tasks such as cleaning her rubbish-strewn house. Chloe died at the hands of her parents after she was repeatedly forced to crash a  motorbike over a three-day period . Counsel assisting the coroner, Naomi Kereru, accused Ms Stewart of defending Polkinghorne's behaviour, saying her obligation was to protect infant Chloe. 'She was a teenager with a baby,' Ms Kereru said. 'You're there to protect the baby, not make excuses for the mother, aren't you?' Social worker Leanne Stewart told the inquest on Wednesday she believed 18-month-old Chloe was receiving 'good enough' care in early 2009, despite substantial evidence of neglect and multiple child abuse notifications, when her mother was 17. Chloe's teenage mother allowed the 18-month-old to be supervised by other teenagers for extended periods, despite being warned by Ms Stewart that this was not acceptable. Family members, including Polkinghorne's father, raised alarms about infant Chloe's safety and told agencies they would be happy to take care of the girl if she was removed from her mother. But Ms Stewart believed some of the allegations may have been malicious or exaggerated because there was 'frequent conflict' in Polkinghorne's family relationships. Polkinghorne was 'just a teenager' and found it difficult to prioritise tasks such as cleaning her often rubbish-strewn house, Ms Stewart said. Polkinghorne, was jailed for at least four years and nine months while the 22-year-old's then-partner, Benjamin McPartland, 28, received four years and two months . Chloe died of 39 different injuries in 2012 . Ms Stewart denied that she was reluctant to act on the child abuse allegations, saying it took time for parents such as Polkinghorne to make sustained changes. Polkinghorne, now 22, and a later partner, Benjamin McPartland, 28, were jailed this year over Chloe's death after pleading guilty to manslaughter through criminal neglect. The inquest will resume for another two weeks on December 1.","Chloe Valentine  died at the hands of her neglectful mother Ashley Polkinghorne and her partner Benjamin McPartland in 2012 .

"Athletic Bilbao have waited 16 long years to get back into the Champions League and when their big moment finally came, they got stage fright. The Basque side had the better of the game against Shakhtar Donetsk but were too worried about their opponents counter-attacking potential to commit as many men forward as they usually do at the San Mames. Perhaps wary of Basque rivals Real Sociedad’s 2-0 defeat by Shakhtar at Anoeta last season, Athletic seemed to play a tighter game than normal, lacking the drive and thrust we have come to see them employ. Athletic Bilbao's Aymeric Laporte attempts to clear as Shakhtar Donetsk's Luiz Adriano is called offside . Shakhtar Donetsk's Taras Stepanenko attempts to bring the ball down in their draw with Athletic Bilbao . Athletic Bilbao: Iraizoz, De Marcos, Laporte, Gurpegi, Balenziaga, Benat (Susaeta 64'), Iturraspe, Ibai Gómez, Mikel Rico, Muniain (Aqueche 75'), Aduriz (Fernandez 77') Subs not used: Herrerin, San Jose, Iraola, Moran. Booked: Aduriz. Shakhtar Donetsk: Pyatov, Srna, Kucher, Rakitskiy, Azevedo, Fernando (Fred 73'), Stepanenko, Costa, Teixeira, Taison (Marlos 80'), Adriano (Gladkiy 90'). Subs not used: Kanibolotsky, Kryvtsov, Bernard, Ilsinho. Booked: Srna, Taison, Kucher. Ref: Tasos Sidiropoulos. Alex Teixeira scored twice that night and had the ball in the back of the net again for Shakhtar here, but Olexandr Kucher was offside in the build-up so it was ruled out. Athletic’s supporters, however, were in no mood to let the evening drift by. Generally considered the most passionate fans in the country, they were in good voice as their team got their first Champions League campaign since 1998 underway. There were also a handful of Scotland flags around the ground, with the Basques, hoping one day for independence from Spain, keenly interested in what happens in the UK. Ibai Gomez came in for Markel Susaeta from the Athletic side that lost 2-0 at Barcelona on Saturday and he had the first chance of the game, with Darijo Srna blocking well after a rapid Mikel Rico breakaway. A Taras Stepanenko long-ranger had Gorka Iraizoz down to his left smartly in response. The goalkeeper again had to be alert to deny Shakhtar, with Srna's cross-shot heading for lurking Teixeira at the back-post. These two sides have vastly different philosophies, with Athletic's Basque-only, youth-team focused policy at direct odds with Shakhtar's blend of a few Ukrainians with some imported Brazilians. Oscar de Marcos controls the ball after slipping clear of Shakhtar's Yaroslav Rakitskiy at San Mames . Rival managers Ernesto Valverde (Athletic) and Mircea Lucescu (Shakhtar) issue orders from the sideline . There were six from Brazil in their starting line-up, with four from Ukraine and just Srna from elsewhere. The Croatian has been at the club since 2003 and is their captain. The likes of Teixeira and Douglas Costa certainly brought some Samba flair to the Basque Country, with plenty of fancy footwork and neat tricks. The latter in particular added some cutting edge to the Shakhtar team. But it was a bending free-kick from Gomez which get the supporters out of their seats, the ball lurching into the side-netting of Andriy Pyatov's goal, with the relieved keeper left standing. Iker Muniain is Athletic's most creative player, but despite showing a few bright sparks, he was unable to link up much with veteran hitman Aritz Aduriz in the first half. He tricked his way past Marcio Azevedo but his cross was straight at Pyatov. Aduriz was screaming for a penalty just before the interval, when Yaroslav Rakitskiy barged into him as he tried to beat Pyatov to a through-ball, but referee Tasos Sidiropoulos was unimpressed. The Greek official was taking charge of his first Champions League game and dipped into his pocket twice in the first 45, to punish Srna for time-wasting and Taison for diving. Olexandr Kucher soon joined them in the book immediately after the break when he hacked down Aymeric Laporte. Athletic striker Aritz Aduriz (left) appealed for a penalty just before half-time but the referee wasn't interested . Athletic’s brilliant young centre-back was on a run forward, which was rudely halted by the Shakhtar defender. Benat Etxebarria’s free-kick squeezed through a crowd and Laporte tried to turn it towards goal, but his effort was easy for Pyatov to handle. It was Laporte again doing great work for Athletic as Shakhtar pushed for the opener, throwing himself heroically in the way of Teixeira’s shot, after the Brazilian came inside from the left. Muniain, who had worked tirelessly, had a great chance to rampage forward on the break but ran out of steam as he neared the box, with Shakhtar tackling back. Ernesto Valverde hauled him off for youngster Ager Aqueche immediately after, but the crowd stood to applaud the playmaker, chanting ‘Iker’. It was the last real opportunity of the game, with Shakhtar the more satisfied of the two sides, having earned a valuable away point. For Athletic this is a base to build on, but they need to rid themselves of any fears before their next Champions League clash, a must-win game against BATE Borisov.","Athletic Bilbao were in control of the match against Shakhtar Donetsk .

"A former U.S. Marine has joined a growing foreign legion of Western fighters battling ISIS on the frontline just weeks after he starred in a survival reality TV show. Photos have emerged on social media that apparently show Joshua Bell, 28, who appeared in the third season of Naked and Afraid, a reality survival show produced by the Discovery Channel. In 'Nicaragua Nightmare', Bell alongside his fellow contestant, Amanda Leigh, had to survive 21 days in the Central American jungle. The episode was aired in early September 2014 and saw Bell suffering with fever and sickness while helping a female fellow contestant make a bikini out of small strips of duct-tape. Just two months later, on November 10, Bell arrived on the frontline in the besieged city of Kobane . Bell is among the latest foreign volunteers - many of them ex-US, British and Canadian military - to join a group called The Lions Of Rojava, who have been mounting a brave counter attack against Islamic State terrorists in northern Syria over the past few months. The Lions Of Rojava act as a foreign legion for the Kurdish People's Protection Unit (YPG) - a group that has been mounting a brave resistance against ISIS in Kobane for more that two months. Scroll down for video . Brave: Joshua Bell, 28 (second from right) is among the latest foreign volunteers to join a Kurdish anti-ISIS group called The Lions Of Rojava. Here he is pictured with Brits James Hughes (left) and Jamie Read (right) Television: Just weeks ago Joshua Bell (right) appeared in the third season of Naked and Afraid, a reality survival show produced by the Discovery Channel . Bell was a contestant on Naked and Afraid on September 7. In the show, both contestants are strangers and have to work together to survive unassisted in a hostile environment. In each episode, contestants have to strip naked and meet each other in a tough environment, normally in the middle of a thick jungle or a remote island. The two survivalists have to find clean water, food and build a weather proof shelter. Bell is  28-years-old and was born in Florida. At the age of three, he and his family moved to South Carolina before switching to Roxboro, North Carolina, when he was just six years old. He is understood to have served for four years in the US marines, reaching the rank of Corporal and being deployed to both Afghanistan and Iraq. Past: The episode was aired in early September 2014 and saw Bell suffering with fever and sickness while helping female fellow contestant Amanda Leigh make a bikini out of small strips of duct-tape (pictured) Suffered: Despite his  reputation as a survivalist and all-round tough guy, Joshua Bell surprisingly quit Naked and Afraid after just five days. His short stay in the jungle was dogged by vomiting and dehydration . A message posted on a Facebook page set up to help raise money for Bell's journey to join the Lions of Rojava says he was awarded both the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal and a combat action ribbon. On the same page Bell wrote his desire to fight against ISIS: 'I ain't doing it for glory, or praise, or fame, or money. It needs to be done. I am scared s***less. But if you ain't scared you are a liability. 'There is a part of my life I do not share very often. I am absolute hell in a gunfight. I learned early on in the Marine Corps that I had extreme combat proficiency. Skills that I quickly honed, and still continue to sharpen regularly,' he added. 'I never thought I would use these skills again...However, an opportunity to re-enter the fray has presented itself,' he went on to say. A photograph shared on the Lions of Rojava Facebook page this week showed Joshua Matson (bottom left),  Jamie Read (top, second from left), Joshua Bell (bottom right) and Jamie Hughes posing alongside an unidentified man (top, second from right), Briton (top left) and American (top centre) Fundraising: Joshua Bell struggled to raise enough money to fund his flight to Syria. As a result a friend set up a website selling yellow T-shirts bearing the slogan 'Project: Give Josh a lift' Despite the Facebook page and a GoFundMe account, it is understood that Bell struggled to make the $3,500 he said he needed to travel to join the Lions of Rojava through donations alone. As a result a friend named Jonathan Whitfield set up a website selling T-shirts bearing the slogan 'Project: Give Josh a lift' to raise money. The T-shirts are yellow and green to match the colours of the Kurdish flag, with the flag itself also appearing on the T-shirts alongside that of the United States. Beneath the two flags is the phrase 'Brothers from another mother against terrorism'. When he was still unable to raise the cash for the journey, Bell was forced to sell his personal Tabuk sniper rifle for $1,400 to pay for his plane tickets. Armed: According to his biography on the show, Bell served with the US Marine Corps and had a gunsmithing business. He is understood to have arrived in northern Syria in late September or early October . According to his biography on Naked and Afraid, Bell now owns gunsmithing business. He enjoys spending 'a lot of time hunting whatever is in season.' It also states 'he loves to cook freshly harvested game, and does so every chance he gets.' Bell's short biography on the Discovery channel website states: 'Survival is his way of life, since Joshua lives pretty far outside of town. Growing up, his family took what they needed from the land, and bought the rest in town. They grew fresh vegetables, hunted, and fished.' Despite his supposed reputation as a survivalist and all-round tough guy, Bell surprisingly quit the show after just five days. His short stay in the jungle was dogged by vomiting and dehydration as Bell struggled in the hot jungle. His fellow survivalist, Amanda Leigh, went on to survive the full 21 days in the jungle. The pair were later dubbed 'the duct tape duo' on social media in honour of 'Country boy' Bell's best achievement on the show, which was to make a bikini out of duct tape for fellow survivalist, Leigh. Volunteers: Among the many Western fighters joining the Lions of Rojava in their campaign to defeat ISIS are Jamie Read from north Lanarkshire, Scotland (left) and James Hughes (right) from Reading in Berkshire . Military background: James Hughes, is understood to originally be from Reading in Berkshire and served three tours of Afghanistan during his five years of service in the British army . When asked if he would want to appear on the show again, Bell later commented on Facebook: 'I hope I get to try again one day.' Bell arrived in Syria on November 10 and joined the Lions of Rojava - a foreign legion within the ranks of the Kurdish YPG force. He is likely to have been inspired by the group's leader Jordan Matson, who made headlines as one of the first American nationals to join the Kurdish militia. Matson has become a poster boy for the Kurds, who have been calling on fighters from around the world to volunteer in their ranks. In recent weeks the number of Western fighters - many of them ex-military - joining the Lions of Rojava in their campaign to defeat the Islamic State has swelled massively. These photographs show an Gill Rosenberg, 31 - an Israeli-Canadian fighting alongside The Lions Of Rojava . Photographs of Ms Rosenberg frequently appear on the group's Facebook page . Among the Westerners who have travelled to fight with The Lions Of Rojava are at least three British nationals. James Hughes, is understood to originally be from Reading in Berkshire and served three tours of Afghanistan during his five years of service in the British army. He has been pictured fighting alongside both Matson and another Briton named Jamie Read. Read is originally from Newmains in north Lanarkshire, Scotland and it is understood he originally trained with the French army. In postings on his Facebook page last week, Read detailed fierce gun battles with ISIS militants in Kobane. Among those replying to his messages was Jordan Matson. Fightback: The Lions Of Rojava act as a foreign legion for the Kurdish People's Protection Unit (YPG) - a group that has been mounting a brave resistance against ISIS in Kobane for more that two months . ISIS first besieged the Syrian city of Kobane in September - raising their flag over a number of areas . A photograph shared on the official Lions of Rojava Facebook page earlier this week showed Bell, Matson, Read and Hughes posing together with assault rifles and wearing full military fatigues in northern Syria. Also in the seven-man photograph is a man described as a third Briton, who has previously been pictured in other images uploaded to the social media accounts affiliated with the YPG. The group of men also includes an as yet unidentified American national who appears a lot older than the other fighters, wears casual clothes and has a hat pulled low over his face. Blast: Thanks to Kurdish resistance fighters on the ground and US-led airstrikes (pictured), ISIS has now been largely pushed out the centre of Kobane . Details of the Lions of Rojava emerged as ISIS reportedly destroyed one of the oldest churches in Iraq with dynamite. According to local activists, St George's Church and a small nunnery were  blown up in northern Mosul on Monday. The destruction of the church symbolises a destructive policy of violence against religious sites which are deemed 'unIslamic' by the hardline extremist group. In July, Islamic State blew up a number of Shi'ite mosques and churches as well as the shrine of Jonah and the tomb of Daniel.  Prior to its destruction, the shrine of Jonah had been a popular pilgrim site for many Christians from around the world. Mosul has been held by Islamic State since the group, led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, rapidly seized Iraq's second largest city in June 2014. The following month the terror leader was filmed giving a sermon at the city's historic mosque.","Joshua Bell appeared in third season of Naked and Afraid in September .

"The increasing fashion for young Muslim women in Britain to wear the burka (in contrast to their mothers, who do not) is one of most sinister developments of our times. Supporters of this garment like to pretend that it is a welcome symbol of our society’s multicultural diversity and philosophical tolerance. But such warped thinking is woefully misguided. In reality, the burka is an archaic tribal piece of cloth that is eagerly used by fundamentalist zealots to promote a toxic brand of extremist non-Koranic theology. Everyone in Britain, including Muslims, should oppose the insidious spread of this vile piece of clothing, which imprisons women, threatens social harmony, fuels distrust, has grave health implications and is a potent security risk. Scroll down for video . Dr Taj Hargey is launching a nationwide campaign to impose a ban on face masks, including burkas, in public spaces in Britain . Contrary to the claims of its advocates, it has nothing to do with Islam but is a cultural fad imported from Saudi Arabia and primitive parts of the Islamic world. That is why this week, with the Muslim Educational Centre of Oxford, I am launching a nationwide campaign to impose a ban on face masks in public spaces in Britain. Such a nationwide prohibition would deal with all types of covering, including balaclavas, but there would be no exemption for the burka/niqab on any spurious, politically correct grounds of religious conscience. One of the key purposes of this initiative is to persuade at least 100,000 people to sign a formal petition calling for the ban, thereby obliging Parliament to debate the issue. Despite growing concern from the British public, our pusillanimous politicians have refused to address the burgeoning prevalence of the burka in our midst, as they fear accusations of Islamophobia from the militant fundamentalists and their PC allies. There is no religious requirement on Muslims to don the burka, and no evidence in the Koran to support the wearing of the garment . Well, it is time to put the needs of British society before the manufactured grievances of the hardliners, whose aim is to replace our liberal democracy with a totalitarian theocracy, the burka serving as a weapon in this far-reaching cultural war. In rejecting the ideology of the zealots, mainstream Muslims should be at the forefront of the campaign for a ban, not least because the burka so badly undermines the credibility and reputation of our faith. There have, of course, been previous petitions and calls to outlaw face masks in public, but all came from the political Right and gained little traction. This campaign is different. It is the first one led by Muslims, speaking for the moderate majority whose voice has been unheeded up to now. We invite both Muslims and our other fellow citizens to work together to rid Britain of this alien cultural monstrosity. A key part of the impetus for this move came from the decision of the European Court of Human Rights this month to uphold the ban instituted by the French Government in 2010 on all face coverings in public. Supported by lawyers from Birmingham, a 24-year-old French woman of Pakistani origin took her well-funded case to the ECHR, claiming that the ban was a violation of her  — and note the sequence —  religious, cultural and personal rights. On every level, this questionable appeal relied on distortions and untruths. Thankfully her case was thrown out, but her arguments illustrate the chronic weakness of any suggestion that we must allow the burka to be worn in public. First, there is no religious requirement on Muslims to don the burka; second, the burka is not a feature of Pakistani culture, where 90 per cent of women do not wear it; third, there is no unqualified human right to wear whatever we want in public. In every developed society, personal freedoms have to take account of wider social mores. The French ban has proved to be legally sound as well as sensible. I have long believed that the same measure should be introduced here in the UK to prevent community separatism and social apartheid. And, like the ECHR, I see no basis for the pretence that there is any religious sanction for the burka. The wearing of the face mask is a custom originating in ancient Persia and Byzantium, more than 1,000 years before the birth of Islam. It was upheld by male aristocrats because of social snobbery rather than religion, since they did not want their womenfolk — wives, daughters, sisters or mothers — to be seen by the peasantry. According to Dr Hargey, everyone in Britain, including Muslims, should oppose the insidious spread of the burka, which he says imprisons women, threatens social harmony, fuels distrust, has grave health implications and is a potent security risk . Nor is there any evidence in the Koran to support the wearing of the burka. Indeed, the Holy Book stipulates that men ‘should lower their gaze’ when meeting women to avoid lecherous staring (verse 24, chapter 30). So logically, if women were fully covered up there would be no need for such an instruction. Some Muslim clergy claim that the burka is religiously necessary. They assert this because the Prophet Muhammad’s wives allegedly hid their faces in public. These puritanical clerics do not base their theological misrepresentations on the Koran but on the subsidiary and suspect hadith (a collection of books containing the reputed sayings of Muhammad, written 250 years after his death). 'It is forbidden for Muslim women going on . pilgrimages to Mecca to cover their faces. So if such a pre-Islamic . practice is banned in Islam’s holiest site, why on earth would it be . required on the streets of Britain?' In any case, this is a wilful misreading of scripture. In fact, verse 32 of chapter 33 in the Koran explicitly states that ‘the Prophet’s wives are not like other women’. So  there is no reason to emulate them. Just as revealingly, it is forbidden for Muslim women going on pilgrimages to Mecca to cover their faces. So if such a pre-Islamic practice is banned in Islam’s holiest site, why on earth would it be required on the streets of Britain? The truth is that there is no theological foundation for these separatist face masks, as most non-fundamentalists recognise. Only recently, Al-Azhar, the leading institution of Muslim theology in the Islamic world, declared that the burka has no spiritual authenticity. Theology apart, there are many other compelling arguments against the burka. It badly undermines social cohesion by inhibiting effective interaction between Muslims and non-Muslims in the public realm. There can be no meaningful exchange with people if you cannot even see their faces. Moreover, the burka is an affront to the concept of gender parity in the UK. If I tried to wear a ski-mask on a bus or at a bank, I would quickly be told to remove the item or leave, or be arrested. Why should the same rules not apply to Muslim women? Dr Hargey's proposals for a nationwide prohibition would deal with all types of facial covering, including balaclavas . The demand for equal rights has always been central to the feminist cause, and in this case feminists should be calling for men and women to be treated equally. Either everyone has the right to mask their face or no one has. There are  huge implications for security, after several cases of terrorists and criminals using the burka to evade detection — a particularly worrying development given the explicit, bloody threats of militant extremists. In our troubled world, there can be no absolute right to anonymity in public. 'We cannot continue to accept the creeping . Arabisation of Islam in the UK and consequent destruction of our . cherished British freedoms. A stand must be made now' Another concern is  the health risks, for . full coverings mean a distinct lack of exposure to sunshine. One recent . study of 203 burka-clad women in the United Arab Emirates revealed that . all but four were deficient in Vitamin D. If that can happen in a land of blazing heat, how much worse will be the problems in often damp, dark Britain? Our society is already seeing rises in rickets and other bone-related diseases for the first time since World War II. Supporters of the burka talk about freedom of choice — yet it is not women who are being given that freedom, but men who are imposing their will. That is not empowerment but imprisonment. The burka is just another weapon in the jihadist arsenal of misogyny, like forced marriage, female genital mutilation and sexist discrimination. It should have no part in British society, where women are supposed to be treated as equal citizens. By tolerating it, we are allowing a form of gender apartheid to grow in our midst. All of us, Muslims and non-Muslims alike, have a duty to challenge the religious hardliners who have cynically exploited British traditions of tolerance and individual liberty to pursue their own twisted sectarian agenda imported wholesale from the Arab Middle East. A start could be made by forcing our politicians to debate the issue by gathering sufficient signatures for our historic anti-burka petition. We cannot continue to accept the creeping Arabisation of Islam in the UK and consequent destruction of our cherished British freedoms. A stand must be made now.",Dr Taj Hargey is the Imam of the Oxford Islamic Congregation and the Director of the Muslim Educational Centre of Oxford .
"For most, Valentine's Day conjures up images of red roses, chocolates and love poems in cute greetings cards. But for Sara X, who is better known as 'Mozart boob twerking girl,' it is a time to upload a new film of her breasts moving in time to music. Sara X Mills, 27, from LA, made waves online by twerking her breasts in time to Mozart's Eine kleine Nachtmusik last year, and now the former stripper is back  in a Valentine's themed clip. Sara X Mills is back flexing her voluptuous breasts along to Ludwig van Beethoven's Für Elise . She wears a tutu skirt and angel wings as well as - of course - a skimpy bralet in the video . In the video, she appears holding a Cupid's bow and arrow and wearing a fancy dress style outfit comprising of tutu skirt and angel wings as well as - of course - a skimpy bra. To the sound of Ludwig van Beethoven's Für Elise, Sara flexes her chest muscles one at a time, so her breast tissue moves up and down. The heavily-tattooed model released a festive version of her party trick back in December, moving her boobs along to the tune of Jingle Bells. She first appears in the video dressed in a faux fut coat, but soon strips off the item of clothing to reveal a candy cane striped bikini top. Sara then executes some synchronized chest movements to the rhythm of Jingle Bells. But the initial clip that first made her famous showed Sara X Mills moving her breasts individually and simultaneously to the sound of Mozart. The video went viral and was viewed more than 26 million times in just one week. Sara's popularity was a double-edged sword though, as the short film gave her instant fame and helped to raise money for charity but it also brought death threats. In an interview after the first clip went global, Sara revealed that she was 'bored and uninspired' at the time she recorded the video. And she revealed that she received a barrage of abuse from internet trolls after the clip went global in October. As Sara flexes her pec muscles one at a time her breast tissue moves up and down making, her boobs look like they're jiggling all on their own. Her talent has made her a global sensation online . She told Jezebel at the time: 'I know I've definitely been called a w**** and a s*** and an attention w**** far more times than I ever was when I was actually in an adult industry. 'Mostly the people who have negative things to say about my character, or my presumed profession, past profession, and life decisions don't get that the video is meant to be humorous, and operate under the assumption that I just wanted to show the world my boobs.' Sara said that she had found the attention her trick had brought disconcerting and that she wouldn't feel too sad when her time in the spotlight passed. However, she must have had a change of heart since making those statements as she uploaded the Christmas clip to YouTube afterwards, which received more than one million views in a day. And she has now  presented a Valentine's February treat, which currently has more than 600,000 views. Historians will applaud her choice of theme tune for the love-themed day, as Beethoven reportedly wrote the piece for a woman he proposed to, but who ended up marrying an Austrian nobleman instead. The former stripper first became an internet star by jiggling her breasts to Mozart. She then filmed another clip just in time for Christmas where she moves her chest in time to Jingle Bells .

"Britain’s oldest person – and the last survivor of the Victorian age – has died at the age of 114. Great-grandmother Ethel Lang lived through six monarchs and 22 prime ministers. Born on May 27, 1900, a year before the end of Queen Victoria’s reign, she was said to be the eighth oldest person in the world. Mrs Lang’s lifetime spanned the Wright Brothers’ first flight in 1903, both world wars, the 1917 Russian Revolution, the Wall Street Crash of 1929, the Moon landings and the invention of the internet. Ethel Lang, pictured with staff at the Water Royd House, Barnsley, on her birthday, died aged 114 yesterday . When the Titanic sank she was 11 – and she was 101 when terrorists flew planes into the Twin Towers, triggering the War on Terror. Mrs Lang died yesterday at the Water Royd House nursing home, in Barnsley. The home confirmed her death but said it could not comment any further. Her daughter Margaret Bates, 91, led tributes to her yesterday, saying: ‘She was such a good mum. I’m so proud of her. ‘She was registered blind in 1988 but it never stemmed her enthusiasm for life, even in her later years. 'I would take her into town and she would ask me to point out to her things like buildings and landmarks. She hated to be stuck indoors.’ She was the youngest daughter of Charles Lancaster, a miner, and his wife Sarah and was born when the Marquess of Salisbury was prime minister. She lived in the Worsbrough area of Barnsley  all her life and left school aged 13 to go to work at Sudgen's shirt factory. In 1922, she married William Lang, a young plumber and the only son of Barnsley councillor Thomas Lang, at St Mary's Church, Barnsley. Widowed when her husband died in 1988, aged 92, she lived independently until she was 105, when she moved into a care home. Mrs Lang, pictured left aged 20, and right, aged 27 with husband William and daughter Margaret in 1927 . Her hobby was dancing, which she enjoyed until 107. She was also a keen snooker fan and her favourite player was Jimmy White. Her longevity was perhaps helped by the fact that she never smoked and rarely touched alcohol. She was a good cook, made her own bread and always ate wholesome food, according to her family. Genetics were also on her side. Her mother lived to 91 and, when a relative traced her family tree, many ancestors turned out to have had long lives all the way back to the early 1700s. Mrs Lang, pictured right aged 106, has a daughter Margaret Bates, pictured left, who is now 91 . Mrs Lang became the longest surviving person after Londoner Grace Jones, died aged 113 in 2013. Pictured, celebrating her 112th birthday at Water Royd House, in Barnsley . Last year, Mrs Lang celebrated her 114th birthday with a piece of cake and a cup of tea along with her family and friends. She became the longest surviving person after Londoner Grace Jones, died aged 113 in 2013. Mrs Lang’s death means that Gladys Hooper, of the Isle of Wight, now appears to be Britain’s oldest person. She will be 112 tomorrow. The world’s oldest person is thought to Japan’s Misao Okawa. She is due to turn 117 in March. According to the Isle of Wight County Press, Mrs Hooper was born on January 18, 1903. She was brought up in Rottingdean, Brighton, and  was friends with aviation pioneer Amy Johnson. She played the piano to a high standard and became a concert pianist in London and mixed with the likes of band leaders Jack Payne, Debroy Somers and Maurice Winnick.","Ethel Lang was born in the Worsbrough area of Barnsley in May 1900 .

"A Maori Muslim leader who openly supports extremist activity in the Middle East has started his own Islamic State in a New Zealand town. Te Amorangi Kireka-Whaanga, who is the leader of the Aotearoa Maori Muslim Association, announced via social media on Sunday that he had changed the organisation's name to the Islamic State of Aotearoa. Mr Kireka-Whaanga of Hastings, north-east of Wellington, has openly supported the Islamic State militant group in the past on Facebook saying it will cause the end of western civilisation. Scroll down for video . Te Amorangi Kireka-Whaanga has started the Islamic State of Aotearoa in Hastings, north-east of Wellington . He posted on his Facebook page calling on 'Muslim souljahs, warriors and followers of prophet Muhammad' to make their way to Hastings and 'blow everyone away with the beauty and magic of love, truth, wisdom and divine blessings'. 'Out with the old and in with the new, let's radiate the power of truth the magic of it upon the starving souls of mankind.' He proclaims he is 'a peace advocate trying to achieve my goal of winning a Nobel peace prize'. Mr Kireka-Whaanga was named one of the world's 500 most influential Muslims by a group in Jordan in 2010 and was one of just two New Zealanders to make the list, the New Zealand Herald reports. The mayor of the Hastings, Lawrence Yule, said the Facebook posts to Mr Kireka-Whaanga's 900-odd friends were 'very concerning' considering the violent nature of the group in the Middle East. 'I don't think any normal, law-abiding Kiwi would think there's any time or place for this kind of behaviour,' he said. 'When you have our own citizens setting up a terrorist-style cult within New Zealand, then the agencies on behalf of New Zealanders will do anything they can to stamp them out. I don't think there's any place in New Zealand for these Islamic cults.' Last month, Mr Kireka-Whaanga told the Star Times that his family wanted to relocate to Syria but he expected his passport to be cancelled by the New Zealand government. He said the United Nations didn't care that Muslims were being killed across the world and he understood the actions of the Islamic State. 'If you practise your religion then of course you'll be 100 per cent behind Islamic State,' he said .","Te Amorangi Kireka-Whaanga started the Islamic State of Aotearoa in Hastings, north-east of Wellington .

"New questions surround the disappearance of an American soldier who was captured by the Taliban after an email that he sent to his parents hints that he was so disappointed with the American mission in Afghanistan that he may have defected. Shortly before he disappeared three years ago, Bowe Bergdahl told his parents he was 'ashamed to even be American' and was disgusted with the Army, according to emails quoted in Rolling Stone magazine. Bergdahl, a 26-year-old Army sergeant from Hailey, Idaho, was taken prisoner on June 30, 2009, in Afghanistan. Captured: Bowe Bergdahl, 26, was an Army sergeant when he was taken prisoner on June 30, 2009, in Afghanistan . The military has never detailed circumstances of his disappearance or capture, and he is not classified as a deserter. He was initially listed as 'duty status unknown' and is now considered 'missing-captured.' He is the only U.S. prisoner of war from the Afghanistan conflict, and U.S. officials say they are actively trying to free him. The White House declined comment on the emails or Bergdahl's possible motivation for leaving his base in eastern Afghanistan in 2009. The Rolling Stone article, to be published Friday, also quotes other soldiers and associates of Bergdahl's as saying that he had talked about walking to Pakistan if his deployment was 'lame' and that shortly before his disappearance he had asked whether he should take his weapon if he left the base. Friends and other soldiers describe a survivalist mentality, and Bergdahl's father, Bob, told the magazine that his son was 'living in a novel.' 'The future is too good to waste on lies,' one email reads. 'And life is way too short to care for the damnation of others, as well as to spend it helping fools with their ideas that are wrong. In custody: The Taliban released a video of Bergdahl after they captured him and a man holds up the soldier's dogtags to prove that it is in fact the 26-year-old . Classification: He was initially listed as 'duty status unknown' and is now considered 'missing-captured' ‘The US army is the biggest joke the world has to laugh at. It is the army of liars, backstabbers, fools, and bullies. ‘The few good (sergeants) are getting out as soon as they can, and they are telling us privates to do the same.’ The emails were provided to the magazine by Bergdahl's family in Idaho, which has gone public with its own discontent with U.S. efforts to free their son. There is no way to authenticate the emails. Some of Bergdahl's reported words read like a suicide note. 'I am sorry for everything,' he wrote. 'The horror that is America is disgusting.' Questionable clues: Reports emerged in 2010 that a Taliban leader told British officials that Bergdahl was teaching Taliban members how to build and detonate bombs, but the U.S. denied it . He mailed home boxes containing his uniform and books. In . 2010, rumors circulated following allegations made by Taliban leader . Haji Nadeem, who said that Bergdahl has been training and helping the Al . Qaeda operatives how to make bombs. Pentagon officials immediately denied the charges, saying that the stories told by Nadeem didn’t ‘hold much water from the get-go’ since he claimed that Bergdahl had weapons and arms on him when he was captured, which is not true. Both official reports and the Rolling Stone article say that Bergdahl left the base with only a bottle of water and a compass. The claims add an element of Hollywood storytelling to the situation, and not surprisingly so: the idea of an American soldier defecting to the Taliban before returning to the U.S. is the basis of Showtime’s hit Homeland. Similar: The story of Bergdahl echoes that of the TV show Homeland, starring Damian Lewis as the soldier with a suspicious past and Claire Danes is the agent who is daring enough to question the returning war hero . Damian Lewis plays the soldier with a suspicious past while Claire Danes is the agent who is daring enough to question the returning war hero. In spite of Pentagon denials, the emails that Bergdahl sent to his parents reveal that he was in a seemingly emotional state at the time of his disappearance, which may lend credence to the theories that he may have ulterior motives behind his imprisonment. U.S. government officials continue to brush off claims of defection, and have continued plans to retrieve the soldier. Bergdahl is the subject of a proposed prisoner swap in which he would be traded for five Taliban adherents imprisoned by the United States at the military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The Taliban have walked away from the deal and larger negotiations with the United States, but the Obama administration is still pushing a negotiated settlement between the Taliban and the U.S.-backed government in Afghanistan. Continued efforts: U.S. officials are trying to negotiate a prisoner exchange with the Taliban .","Bowe Bergdahl, 26, walked out of U.S. base in Afghanistan in June 2009 and was captured by the Taliban .

"Widnes beat Hull KR to tighten their grip on the final First Utility Super League play-off place in a physical encounter at the Select Security Stadium. Two tries in as many minutes at the beginning of the second half gave the Vikings the confidence to see out the game. First Joe Mellor flew over and then Kevin Brown finished off a brilliant inter-passing move to give the Vikings the edge. The hosts did not have it all their own way though as Hull KR threw everything at them but in the end the visitors did not have the power to deal with the vibrant Vikings, who head into next week’s Tetley’s Challenge Cup semi-final against Castleford in great shape thanks to a 28-10 victory. Clean hitting: Danny Tickle sends a conversion flying over as Widnes comfortably beat Hull KR on Sunday . With only one point separating the two teams beforehand, it was always going to be a tense affair and that was the way the first period played out. The Vikings got their noses in front after ten minutes as Jack Owens latched onto a Brown cross-field kick to put the home side in charge. Hull KR winger Ade Gardner was left in no man’s land as the pinpoint kick caught him napping on the right flank. Owens was on hand to zoom up behind him and over for the first try of the afternoon. Danny Tickle missed the conversion. The Robins thought they had hit back immediately through dangerous Australian stand-off Travis Burns but that effort was ruled out by referee Robert Hicks for an infringement. Rovers were not to be denied, though, as Burns linked up with James Green to send over Kris Keating for a well-worked score. Burns could not add the conversion. Willie Isa then rampaged his way forward and his offload to Rhys Hanbury gave the Vikings full-back some room to manoeuvre and he passed to Danny Galea who sent in Chris Dean for a sweeping Widnes try. Tickle was on target with the conversion to put Widnes 10-4 in front at half-time. It did not stay that way for long after the interval as Widnes stretched their lead to 12 as Mellor finished off a superb break from Dave Allen to romp home under the posts. Tickle added the extras and Denis Betts’ men were well in command. The Vikings came out the traps aggressively and they were in again two minutes later as Dean turned the Robins defence inside out and his timely pass to Owens was enough to create the score for Brown. The Robins put themselves back in it, however, on 50 minutes as powerful back rower Jason Chan burst over to give Burns an easy conversion. The tit-for-tat scoring continued, this time it was Vikings’ centre Stefan Marsh speeding over after good work from Brown and Mellor. Jack Owens was unsuccessful with the touchline conversion. Owens was in action again on the opposite flank after Rhys Hanbury’s terrific solo score. The Robins kept plugging away, with Ben Cockayne going close, but the Vikings held on to extend their cushion in eighth spot to three points.","Widnes look set for a play-off place in the Super League .

"Boris Johnson wants to take charge of London's courts and prosecutors in a major seizure of powers by the Mayor. As London Mayor, Mr Johnson is already responsible for policing, transport and housing in the capital but wants to wrestle more controls from ministers in Whitehall. The idea emerged as he continues his tour of the Far East, reaching the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur today. London Mayor Boris Johnson, pictured at Epsom College in Kuala Lumpur, wants to take control of courts and prosecutors in the capital . Mr Johnson is a on a six-day trade trip to the Far East, where he met local Malaysian businesses . Mr Johnson will remain as London Mayor until 2016, but is also standing to become an MP in next year's general election. The plan to seize control of justice in London would create a New York-style system with the mayor overseeing the entire process from initial arrest to charging and sentencing. The Mayor already holds the Metropolitan police to account, and is able to hire and fire the chief constable. Stephen Greenhalgh, Mr Johnson's deputy mayor for policing, told The Guardian: 'The criminal justice system should be held to account as the Met is in London, otherwise these are unaccountable agencies not answering to the people of London.' Savings could be found by having the police, courts and prosecutors 'in the same buildings, working off the same IT systems, with the same priorities,' he said. 'It is a 19th-century construct with 19th-century technology which needs to move into the 21st century.' The idea is also being studied by Labour, with the party's police and crime commissioner in Manchester, Tony Lloyd, backing the idea. 'It makes sense to explore the possibility of bringing local Crown Prosecution Service and court services under the oversight of police and crime commissioners, establishing transparency and public accountability throughout the entire criminal justice system,' he said. Mr Johnson crosses the road in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where he met the Mayor of the Malaysian capital Ahmad Phesal Talib (left) and was shown a view over the city from his offices . The London Mayor had breakfast at a cafe in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, with city mayor Ahmad Phesal Talib . Mr Johnson has previously called for the Mayor to have overall control of schools in London, which is currently held by the capital's boroughs. Today Mr Johnson is to meet the prime minister of Malaysia and the mayor of Kuala Lumpur as he reaches the third country of a high-profile regional tour. He has been repeatedly mobbed by members of the public on his trip, which will continue for the next two days. Ahead of events in Malaysia, Mr Johnson said: 'This fast-developing nation is teaming with new and exciting trade and investment opportunities. From great new feats of transport engineering to cutting-edge design and architectural projects, I urge more British companies to get involved.' As well as senior politicians, Mr Johnson's engagements will involve the unveiling of the architect of the planned Malaysia Square at Battersea. The square will be the 'public realm centrepiece' of the major regeneration project under way at the Thames landmark. The announcement will be made with prime minister Mohammad Najib Abdul Razak. He is also due to meet Tony Fernandes, owner of Queen Park Rangers and Caterham Cars, at Epsom College's Kuala Lumpur campus.","London Mayor already oversees the Metropolitan Police in the capital .

"London mayor Boris Johnson did little to dispel his city's reputation for excessive consumption when he appeared in Jakarta today. The weighty politician's midriff was all the more noticeable for its contrast to wasp-thin Indonesian President Joko Widodo, who cycled alongside him on a car-free day in Jakarta. With Mr Johnson's 'London Is Great' T-shirt losing the battle to contain his chest fat, it seemed ironic the Tory big beast's itinerary included sharing the experience of running London's Olympic Games with local politicians.

Public appearance: Jakarta Governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama alias Ahok, right, talks to Mayor Boris, centre, and British Ambassador to Jakarta Moazzam Malik, left, during a ceremony in Jakarta . But despite their physical disparity, Mr Johnson will be hoping he can share something in common with Mr Widodo: the Indonesian head of state enjoyed a meteoric rise to his country's top job after first becoming governor of Jakarta in 2012. That's a route observers say Mr Johnson, who has been London mayor since 2008, is hoping to emulate, as speculation grows that Tory leader and current PM David Cameron is losing the support of his Conservative Party. Mr Johnson is the first British politician to have a substantial meeting with President Widodo since his inauguration. Ahead of the meeting, Mr Johnson said: 'I'm delighted to be back in Jakarta. I want to try and help cement our strong bilateral relations with Indonesia and further discussion on trade and business opportunities between two great and growing capital cities. 'I'm looking forward to sharing our experience of running the Olympic Games with the president as Indonesia prepares to host the 2018 Asian Games in Jakarta.' Mass movement: Hundreds of cyclists follow the London Mayor and Indonesian President as they enjoy clear roads on Jakarta's car-free day . Easy rider: Mr Johnson glides along one-handed as he makes his way to a meeting with Mr Widodo . Mr Cameron met Mr Widodo briefly at this month's G20 meeting in Brisbane. The Prime Minister last visited Jakarta in February 2012 when he met Mr Widodo's predecessor. The meeting between the president and Mr Johnson is expected to discuss Mr Widodo's G20 speech on the importance of free and fair trade, the importance of building on the UK's strong bilateral relations with Indonesia and shared engagement on education, trade and defence. Interestingly for Mr Johnson, it will also discuss the president's recent election. Indonesia is forecast to be the fifth biggest economy in the world by the mid-2020s. The country has a a huge and burgeoning middle class consumer market and it is the biggest Muslim country in the world. Mr Johnson will seek to increase business opportunities for Britain. Continuing his involvement in the ongoing UK Trade and Industry mission to the Far East, Mr Johnson will push to attract more British investment in Jakarta and Indonesia after research showed 69 per cent of Indonesians feel open to the UK.

"They shot to global fame as the privileged toffs from hit movie The Riot Club - the film based on Old Etonians who go to Oxford University and on towards positions of great power and influence. And it seems that their debauched on-screen activities have worked in their favour because Sam Claflin and Douglas Booth have both landed top modelling jobs. Sam, who also stars alongside Jennifer Lawrence as Finnick Odair in The Hunger Games, is the star of Ciroc Vodka's new campaign, Ciroc On Arrival, and was hand-picked to be photographed by legendary snapper, Mario Testino. Scroll down for video . Photographer Mario Testino picked Hunger Games actor Sam Claflin to star in Ciroc Vodka's new campaign . The campaign is all about hand-picking emerging talents from across the globe and celebrating the latest young stars breaking out in their profession. Sam was chosen by Mario, who regularly works with Cara Delevingne, the Beckhams and Kate Moss, as one to watch in the industry for the London shoot. Speaking about his latest role, 28-year-old Sam said: 'I’ve been lucky enough to have been given some amazing opportunities to be able to do what I love in life. 'Of course, I have had to prove myself in a lot of ways as an actor which puts a lot of pressure on me, so this campaign appealed as it allows me a moment to celebrate.' Sam, who as chosen as an emerging acting talent, regularly works with Cara Delevingne and Kate Moss . Sam prepares for his shoot at The London Edition Hotel. He says the shoot felt like a career 'milestone' The heartthrob describes his wife, Inbetweeners actress Laura Haddock, as his 'female counterpart' Sam has had a lot of acting roles over the years but only shot to prominence in The Hunger Games - he has since become a poster boy within the acting world and a promising thespian. Despite his success, it wasn't always smooth sailing. He explains: 'Being in drama school and all the training you do as an actor, you hope you’re going to make it. 'But there’s a part of you that’s got to be realistic and say: ""Look, it might not happen to me"", so to play the roles I’m now playing and to be selected by Mario Testino, who is world famous for creating some of the most iconic images of recent decades, definitely feels like a milestone in my career.' Sam beefed up to for The Hunger Games: Catching Fire  as Katniss's co-conspirator Finnick Odair last year . Sadly for his female fans, Sam is married to the equally attractive actress, Laura Haddock. Speaking about his wife, who starred as Alison in The Inbetweeners movie, he said: 'She's my female counterpart is the best way to describe her. 'She is my mum. She reminds me of my mum so much which I think - a guy will know, right? It's important. Your mum knows like everything.' Sam and Laura are part of a new London-based group of hot young actors and regularly attend parties with Suki Waterhouse, Cara Delevingne, Jack Whitehall, Gemma Chan, Natalie Dormer and Douglas Booth. Douglas won the heart of the - mostly female - nation in 2013 in Carlo Carlei's film adaptation of Romeo and Juliet.

Speaking in a promotional video as he showcases the label's new sneakers, Douglas speaks of his childhood dreams of finding fame. He said: 'I remember being a kid and having a massive imagination. I would entertain myself just by running around the garden, I wanted to live a thousand lifetimes within my own. Douglas Booth may only be 22 but he is now the star of Salvatore Ferragamo's latest fashion campaign . 'To do that, I had to tell different stories and play different characters. I remember sitting and watching Gladiator 15 to 20 times with my friends, that was inspiring for me. Then to be working with Russell Crowe and him playing my father was a bizarre experience. 'Being driven home from school one day, I said to my friend: ""I want to be an actor"" and he said: ""pfft, it's not going to happen"" and I said: ""why not?"" 'I always just believed that there are people doing things that you dream of doing but you've got to take life by the balls and just do it.' Douglas stars in A Man's Story, a menswear project by photographer and filmmaker Francesco Carrozzini . And he did just that. Douglas, although severely dyslexic who admits to struggling at school, went on to develop a keen interest in drama. By 15, he was a member of the  Curtis Brown acting agency and landed his first professional role in 2009's From Time To Time directed by Julian Fellowes. A role as Pip in the BBC One adaptation of Charles Dickens' Great Expectations in 2011 and a role in Darren Aronofsky's Biblical epic Noah alongside friend Emma Watson followed.

"As temperatures hovered at around 3C this morning, residents in a north London suburb were waking up to get ready for work. But already gathered in a quiet street in Stanmore, since before the sun had risen and temperatures began to increase, were queues of migrants looking for a day's work. The large groups of men were seen standing in the road in long queues, hopeful to pick up work from passing builders and tradesmen in white vans who would pay them  for an extra pair of hands today. So many have started to gather in the leafy London suburb that the queue had spilled out to in front of Selco warehouse in Honeypot Lane, which appeared to have security guards standing outside to ensure the large groups were kept under control. Groups of migrants are queuing outside a north London warehouse in the hope of picking up a day's work . Groups have been gathering at the spot from about 6.30am and there are reports of some approaching local workers directly to ask for work, and others stopping vans to ask if they are needed. They are frequently paid in cash - meaning they often don't pay tax or National Insurance. Just 19, Iusti came to the UK four months ago from Botosani in northern Romania. His father died in August, his mother lives in Italy, his sister in Spain and he has a 16-year-old girlfriend, Valentina, back home. Her father works, earning about £160 a month. He said he came here on his own to earn money. Soon after driving to London in a van with seven other people he found work near Victoria and Pimlico, labouring for three weeks. Work has been sporadic and he now lives with 13 other people in a house on an estate in Queensbury, Harrow, doing occasional jobs in the area as a roofer. Iusti says around 30 or 40 men, Romanians and Romanian gypsies, turn out at around 6am every morning looking for work. Some have been in the UK just a few months and speak little English, and most send money home. In four months he thinks he has been able to find about six weeks' work. But he has not had any for four days. Despite waiting since 7am today, his British boss had not turned up by lunchtime. 'I get about £40, £60 a day, boss takes about £300, £400. Cash, no taxes. Three day work, three day no work. Two day work, five day no work. Dozens of men, dressed for the cold weather, were seen gathering in Stanmore from early this morning . A security guard is photographed outside Selco warehouse, where the groups have recently started to gather . 'In Romania is £100 to £150 a month, £10 for one day. Not work every day in Romania. No money in Romania. Problem. I will send money back to Romania. My girlfriend, Valentina, in Romania, I go to see her for Christmas.' His mother will send him the money so he can drive home, as he cannot afford it. Iusti says he is torn over his situation - between being trapped in his home country where there is no work, and being so far away from home and living alone. 'I like it in England, everything is working, I like. Zero money, no like,' he says. 'It is difficult. Here money, no family. In Romania family, no money. Life here is get food money, smoke money, sleep.' Last week it emerged that up to 200 men from Romania and Bulgaria were gathering every day between a B&Q store on Honeypot Lane and a bar and restaurant named The Honeypot in a bid to find 'off the books' jobs. The latest pictures show the queue spilling over to in front of the nearby Selco warehouse. The men start to arrive at about 6.30am and are hopeful of getting a day's work which will be off the books . Migrants are being picked up by passing builders and tradesmen who need an extra pair of hands for the day . Men standing there are hopeful that passing builders will pick them up for a day's work. They have been seen speaking to builders and other passing tradesmen who travel past in vans. However their presence has not been welcomed in the leafy London suburb, with residents saying they felt intimidated by the large number of people hanging around outside their homes. Groups begin to disperse about 2pm after most vans stop coming past. Suresh Varsani, who runs Dillons estate agents in Honeypot Lane, says Eastern European workers have been touting for work outside his shop six days a week for the last year. Around 50 or 60 people gather at Selco and B&Q every morning from 6am, sometimes staying until noon. Up to 200 migrants were seen queuing up for work outside The Honeypot bar in north London last week . He said: 'It even happens when I am driving. They just come up and say, 'job, job'. It has become a central place for everybody to come for work, and builders are taking them on. I think most of them are cash in hand and it is not right. 'It is an issue and needs to be dealt with. It is not the proper manner for looking for work. I get them hanging around my shop, which I don't really like. It stops other people coming in and it is not a good impression for people outside my shop.' The appearance of large groups of men have led to criticism that Britain is becoming a 'honeypot nation', with endless low pay caused by the constant supply of cheap labour from eastern Europe. Migrant workers from Poland can double their basic pay by coming to the UK, and new arrivals from Bulgaria are able to increase their pay by up to 250 per cent, according to latest figures from the Open Europe think tank.","Large groups of migrant workers seen queuing in north London suburb .

"Novak Djokovic is the man of the moment down under after securing his fifth Australian Open title in Melbourne. The World No 1 defeated Scot Andy Murray 7-6, 6-7, 6-3, 6-0 on Sunday to secure his eighth Grand Slam crown and has now set his sights on the French Open, the only major to currently elude him. The Serbian posed for photographers with the Norman Brookes Challenge Cup on the banks of the Yarra River in Melbourne to toast his success with a glass of champagne. Australian Open champion Novak Djokovic kisses the Norman Brookes Challenge Cup by the Yarra River . Novak Djokovic won his fifth Australian Open title on Sunday after beating British No 1 Andy Murray . Djokovic smiles holding the Norman Brookes Challenge Cup on the banks of the Yarra River in Melbourne . Novak Djokovic has joined an illustrious list of Andre Agassi, Jimmy Connors and Ivan Lendl in winning his eighth grand slam title in the Australian Open. However the World No 1 has already set his sights on becoming just the eighth player to win all four of the game's biggest tournaments by claiming a first French Open in Paris. 'It's incredible to be able to win eight,' said Djokovic. 'I still feel as a 27-year-old I have years to come. Hopefully if I stay healthy and have this disciplined professionalism and commitment to everyday rituals and things I have been doing the last few years, I think I have a fair chance to get myself in another position to win a grand slam or two or three. Djokovic appeared for a photoshoot on Monday having secured his fifth Australian Open crown in Melbourne . Murray congratulates 2015 Australian Open champion Djokovic after their grueling four-set match . 'At this point I am happy with where I am in my life and to be able to join the elite group of players like Agassi and Lendl who won eight grand slams is quite remarkable and I am very proud of it. 'Most of the players will tell you it's important to have the mindset that keeps you in the present moment and once something is done you move on and try to focus on the next one and try not to think too much in advance or in the past, because that allows you to work and reset your ambitions and your goals. 'But I think you have to be honest and say you think about the amount of grand slams you won and tournaments you won and what your place in history is. I definitely have that in the back of my mind and I am very pleased with my accomplishments so far.' The Serbian sprays a celebratory bottle of champagne into the Yarra river having won another Grand Slam . The 27-year-old offered the photographers some of his champagne during a shoot on Monday . Djokovic has lost twice to nine-time French Open champion Rafael Nadal in the final, last year and 2012, acknowledging the Spaniard will be the clear favourite in May. 'I wasn't too far from winning a title both times when I lost to Rafa but it's a grand slam on the slowest surface that is physically the most demanding one. 'That's something that makes it more difficult in terms of winning against Nadal, he has lost only one match in his entire career which is probably the most impressive record in tennis history of all time. 'It's very important (winning the French Open) but if I don't succeed in doing that in my career it's not the end of the world, but I am definitely going to keep on trying. I have been very very close and that allows me to believe I can make that final step and that's something that keeps me going.' Murray shouts out in frustration after losing a point during the first set tiebreak in Melbourne on Sunday . Andy Murray had plenty of chances but eventually succumbed to a relentless Djokovic, who won his fifth Australian Open in as many finals. Despite appearing to struggle physically, which Murray admitted after the brutal contest that he was distracted by the Serbian's antics, Djokovic prevailed in emphatic fashion by winning 12 of the last 13 games, leaving Murray defeated for a fourth time in the Melbourne show piece. Djokovic has sympathy for his Melbourne final opponent but points to the legendary competition in Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal for why they have failed to land more Grand Slam titles . Djokovic lifts his trophy after wining a remarkable fifth title in his fifth final in Australia on Sunday . 'He is there and if he won a couple more matches he would have maybe five grand slams now and it would be a different story,' Djokovic added. 'On the other hand I could as well maybe have won a few more. But this is the generation we are in. There are four players that are incredibly good and very few points decide the winner. 'I believe they (Federer and Nadal) made me a better player and also Andy; they made me understand what I need to do to improve my game to get on the level where they are. 'You can maybe think if I was in another era I would be in double figures already, but everything happens for a reason. I am sure Andy is disappointed not to win a few more grand slams but he is also a better player as a consequence of being a rival of the other three guys.'","Novak Djokovic beat Andy Murray 7-6, 6-7, 6-3, 6-0 on Sunday .

"Dean met Emily Goodhand, 28, in Toronto through friends at a vodka bar . He 'slipped her his room card and his room number after flirting' She claims they spent the night together in his luxury hotel room . He allegedly told Emily he never had sex with Tori anymore . She claims he bragged about his sex tape with Tori . Emily now feels it was a mistake and she made a bad decision . They seemed to have a blissful marriage filled with kids, reality TV and happy photo ops. But on Tuesday, UsWeekly reported there's a serious crack in the marriage of Dean McDermott, 47, and Tori Spelling, 40. Emily Goodhand, 28, has alleged the former hunk slept with her after an alcohol-fueled evening in Toronto, Canada on December 6. 'He was romantic and very complimentary. He was telling me, ""You're so beautiful,""' Emily told the magazine. 'And he told me he and Tori had a sexless marriage. I believed him.' Reps for Tori and Dean did not return calls to MailOnline. Bombshell: Emily Goodhand, 28, told the January 6 issue of UsWeekly she slept with Tori's husband on December 6 in a Toronto hotel room . The one-night-stand allegedly took place after a group of friends met up at Pravda Vodka House in the Canadian city, where Dean was on a promotional tour for his hosting job on the show Chopped Canada. Emily was a friend of a friend and the two were introduced. Her occupation was not disclosed. The father invited the beauty back to the Fairmont Royal York Hotel where they had sex, according to UsWeekly. Too much stress?: The patriarch, 47, looked frazzled when he took his wife and four kids to Disney On Ice's Rockin' Ever After in LA on December 12, just six days after his alleged tryst . 'He seemed like a cool guy,' Emily said. 'I thought he was handsome.' They became friendly over an eight hour meal at Pravda, sitting side by side. 'We were just having fun and hanging out,' Emily added. When heading toward the bar at his hotel, 'he was flirting,' she added, and she explained she was attracted to him because his personality was 'very charming.' The 5'8"" looker explained she felt she could 'trust' him because he opened up to her and was 'talking about his kids and his work.' No smiles here: The Beverly Hills, 90210 beauty running errands on December 21 . She also said they knew a lot of the same people, 'so we had that in common.' During drinks at his Fairmont hotel, the 6'3"" former hunk did not openly flirt with Emily as there were other friends with them. But later the two exchanged phone numbers, then he slipped his card key with his room number into her purse. 'We just looked at each other,' Emily said. Oversharing: Dean reportedly didn't like it when his TV star spouse spilled their financial issues in her new book Spelling It Like It Is . After slyly leaving with friends and making it seem as if she was going home, Emily instead went to Dean's hotel room. At first he wasn't there but then she texted him and he showed up within seconds. 'He wanted to make me feel good,' she explained after he flooded her with compliments. 'Then the time for talking was over.' Emily, who insisted they used protection during their encounter, said Dean gushed about his famous wife. 'He said, ""I love my wife, I love her so much. But she won't sleep with me,""' Emily recounted. Once a cheater, always a cheater?: He stepped out on his wife of 12 years, Mary Jo Eustace (pictured in 2003), when he made 2005's Mind Over Murder with Tori . She then said she had to go home to get a good night's sleep and he asked that they 'cuddle' first. The next day both worked but texted each other. She told him her legs hurt. The next evening - December 7 - she visited the TV star again at the Fairmont Hotel, but this time he had a male pal there. And instead of taking off his clothes, he took out his computer where he showed off photos of Tori and the kids. At one point he even bragged about the sex tape he made with his author spouse. Emily, who has never seen Tori's hit TV series Beverly Hills, 90210, said she did not want to see the tape. At 3am they shared a club sandwich and fries then fell asleep. This time there was no hanky panky, just cuddling. 'It felt cool that I had this connection,' Emily told the weekly. 'Neither one of us said anything about seeing each other again. It was, ""Nice to meet you. Crazy that there was this chemistry. I had a great time,' she added. Emily is now feeling bad about the hook up. 'I f***ed up,' she told UsWeekly. Before the drama: The former actor reportedly told Emily he never had sex with Tori, but in September the married twosome looked happy as they grabbed coffee in Calabasas . Meanwhile, on December 7 Tori - who has sons Liam, aged six, and Finn, 16 months, as well as daughters Stella, aged five, and Hattie, aged two, with Dean - was talking glowingly about Dean. 'We do date night once a week,' the Lifetime favorite said. 'We're into public displays of affection.' The weekly points out that Tori has expressed insecurity about Dean in the past because he left his first wife of 12 years, Mary Jo Eustace (with whom he had a son and a newly adopted girl) during their 2005 affair on the movie Mind Over Murder. In 2012 there were reports he cheated with two women which almost led to a split. Later she admitted they were 'fighting a lot.' Cracks also showed when her book Spelling It Like It Is came out and unveiled their financial troubles. 'Dean felt like it made them look like idiots,' a source told the magazine. The timing couldn't be any worse. They have their new reality show Tori & Dean: Cabin Fever coming out in 2014 on HGTV. She also is starting a new TV series Mystery Girls with 90210 alum Jennie Garth, 41. She also has her lifestyle web site Torispelling.com to plug. 'Tori is the breadwinner,' added the source. Maybe they can work it out?: Tori and Dean are said to be fighting for their marriage amid reports of infidelity on his part .","Dean met Emily Goodhand, 28, in Toronto through friends at a vodka bar .

"To underline the quality of the Bayern Munich side, six of their line-up were World Cup winners. Xabi Alonso, a 2010 champion with Spain, supplemented German club-mates Manuel Neuer, Philipp Lahm, Jerome Boateng, Mario Gotze and Thomas Muller who triumphed in Brazil last summer. City defender Martin Demichelis will remember them, he was part of the Argentine side that lost in the final, as was sub Sergio Aguero. Xabi Alonso was one of six World Cup winners in Bayewrn Munich's starting XI against Manchester City . He may no longer be in situ but this is the sort of week former City Chief Executive Garry Cook dreamed of when he put up provocative 'Welcome to Manchester posters' and claimed they would be the biggest team in the world. While City went toe-to-toe with mighty Bayern, Wayne Rooney and his United team-mates were on a team-bonding night out in a Manchester restaurant this week, jealously looking out at all the Champions League participants. Thomas Muller felt he should have had a penalty after being tripped when facing an open goal . Manchester City have recently signed up all their big-name stars on long-term contracts - except Joe Hart. But England's No1 can't have done his negotiating position any harm with a performance that suggested he's back to his very best. Two saves in particular from Thomas Muller and Mario Gotze were world-class. Quite a difference from a year ago when he was blamed for City's home defeat against the same opposition and dropped soon after. Joe Hart performed admirably against Bayern Munich, pulling off a string of impressive saves . Manuel Pellegrini, serving his last game of a touchline ban, watched on from the posh seats in the Allianz Arena next to Academy Director Brian Marwood, without the help of an abacus. Last season the Chilean suffered his most embarrassing moment as City manager in Munich when he confessed he hadn't realised a 4-2 City win would have left them as group winners to avoid a knockout tie against Barcelona, At 3-2 up, Pellegrini made a defensive substitution by sending on Jack Rodwell for Edin Dzeko. With Manuel Pellegrini serving a touchline ban, his assistant Ruben Cousillas took his place on the bench . City's executives Txiki Begiristain and Ferran Soriano are unabashed Pep Guardiola fans, keeping a close eye on his tactics and dreaming he may one day be lured to The Etihad. It was interesting to see how Guardiola has developed from his Barcelona days. Robert Lewandowski led the line instead of a false number nine and Louis van Gaal would kill for wing-backs like Rafinha and Juan Bernat. City's executives Txiki Begiristain and Ferran Soriano are unabashed fans of Bayern manager Pep Guardiola . For all the quality on show, there was a fair amount of rough-and-tumble too. Thomas Muller was physically fended off by Bacary Sagna in the first minute, Edin Dzeko hurt his back as things got fierce in the trenches. If it sets a Champions League trend, how much will City regret sending their ""Beast"" Alvaro Negredo out on loan to comply with FPP regulations and an enforced Champions League squad. Manchester City and Bayern Munich are full of quality, but physicality played a significant role in the match .","Xabi Alonso one of six World Cup winners in Bayern Munich starting XI .

"Penny Mordaunt, a Navy reservist, said ‘c**k’ six times and ‘lay’ or ‘laid’ five times in a debate purportedly about the welfare of poultry . A Tory MP was criticised yesterday for making a speech riddled with innuendo in the House of Commons following a dare from friends in the Royal Navy. Penny Mordaunt, a Navy reservist, said ‘c**k’ six times and ‘lay’ or ‘laid’ five times in a debate purportedly about the welfare of poultry. It came during the Easter Adjournment debate, by long tradition a time for more lighthearted and off-beat topics. But while the Portsmouth North MP clearly intended her speech to be humorous, many felt she went too far. Yesterday the Mail on Sunday revealed that she was dared to say the rude words by Royal Marines at a mess dinner. She later contacted them to tell them that she had met the challenge. Miss Mordaunt, a contestant on ITV’s diving show Splash! this year, was accused of trivialising Parliament. Labour MP Kate Hoey said: ‘She should realise that the House of Commons is not a TV reality show. The public expects debates in the Chamber to be on matters of serious concern. It is sad that she has misused it in this way – it sets a bad precedent.’ Thousands criticised her speech online, but Miss Mordaunt’s colleagues rallied around her. George Hollingbery, a neighbouring Tory MP, said: ‘She is an absolutely cracking MP who does a huge amount in her local area. ‘She is a character. The House of Commons is full of characters and it’s a better place for it.’ Hampshire councillor John Wall wrote on Twitter: ‘Good to have a member of Parliament and minister with a sense of humour.’ Scroll down for video . Miss Mordaunt, a contestant on ITV’s diving show Splash! this year, was accused of trivialising Parliament . Miss Mordaunt, pictured above appearing on ITV's Daybreak, freely disclosed the story behind the address at the Spectator Magazine’s awards dinner last week . Miss Mordaunt gave the speech in March 2013, before she was made a communities minister. Other topics in the end-of-term session included e-cigarettes and thanks for Commons staff. She freely disclosed the story behind the address at the Spectator Magazine’s awards dinner last week. She said: ‘Some of my Marine training officers at Dartmouth thought it would be a good idea to break my ladylike persona by getting me to yell rude words during the most gruelling part of our training. They failed, but during our mess dinner at the end of the course, I was fined for a misdemeanour. ‘The fine was to say a particular word, an abbreviation of cockerel, several times in a speech on the floor of the Commons, and mention all the names of the officers present.’ Her speech, which was recorded in Hansard, the official record of the Commons, and broadcast on TV, began: ‘The cause of hen and cock welfare is one raised with me by many constituents. ‘One imagines several hens and a single proud cockerel, but one strutting coxcomb will lead to many chicks and what is to become of the male contingent with not a layer among them? I encourage people to . . . think carefully about a coop for a cockerel.’ It concluded: ‘Let us have no cock-ups on hen welfare.’","Penny Mordaunt said ‘c**k’ six times and ‘lay’ or ‘laid’ five times in a debate .

"Paul Chambers, 28, pictured left with comedian Al Murray, was fined £385 and ordered to pay £600 costs at Doncaster Magistrates’ Court in May 2010 but it has been overturned . Telling jokes about blowing up an airport is not a crime, the Lord Chief Justice ruled yesterday. In a landmark High Court ruling, Lord Judge overturned the conviction of a frustrated airline passenger who tweeted that he meant to blow up the airport. Paul Chambers, 28, had been convicted of sending a menacing message even though he broadcast his joke in his own name and no one at Robin Hood Airport in Doncaster took it seriously. The Crown Prosecution Service took him to court under the 2003 Communications Act, and Doncaster magistrates told him to pay £600 costs, a £385 fine and £15 victim surcharge. The conviction in May 2010 was later upheld by a Crown Court judge. But yesterday the Lord Chief Justice said a joke could not by definition be menacing: ‘If the persons who receive and read it, or may reasonably be expected to receive it, or read it, would brush it aside as a silly joke, or a joke in bad taste... it would be a contradiction in terms to describe it as a message of a menacing character.’ The ruling was hailed as a victory for free speech and a rebuke to over-zealous police and lawyers. Mr Chambers, from Corby, Northamptonshire, lost his job as an administration manager after he was convicted and said he had become unemployable because of the prosecution. He sent his tweet when snow shut the airport in January 2010. It said: ‘Robin Hood Airport is closed. You’ve got a week and a bit to get your s*** together otherwise I am blowing the airport sky high!!’ He said after the ruling: ‘It’s a very big decision for people doing what human beings do – telling a joke sometimes, even if it’s a bad one.’ The judges noted there was no evidence before the Crown Court to suggest any of the followers of the 'tweet', or anyone else who may have seen it posted on Mr Chambers’ timeline, found it to be of a menacing character or, at a time when the threat of terrorism was real, even minimally alarming. In fact, nothing was done about it by anyone until five days later when the duty manager responsible for security at the airport, while off duty at home, found it. Offence: The tweet by Paul Chambers that he was originally convicted over . Frustration: Mr Chambers said he sent the tweet as he was annoyed that Robin Hood Airport in South Yorkshire was closed by snow in January 2010 . Robert Smith QC, for the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), had said that, on any view, Mr Chambers, of Corby, Northamptonshire, a man of previous good character who worked as an administration and finance supervisor, was 'very foolish' to do what he did. He said the question was, by whose standards and by what members of society would such a message be viewed as a joke, given that those who had access to it would probably not have any knowledge of the circumstances which led to it being sent? Stephen Fry welcomed the 'complete vindication and victory' for Mr Chambers following today’s ruling. The broadcaster and comedian, who stood alongside Mr Chambers during an earlier appeal hearing, took to Twitter to congratulate him and his legal team. The star, who is taking a break from the social networking site, wrote: 'Pops head up quickly: complete vindication and victory for Paul Chambers in twitterjoketrial. Well done DavidAllenGreen and team. Bye!' Stephen Fry, a prominent Twitter user, tweeted at the time that he would be happy to pay Chambers' fine . Fellow comedian Al Murray, who was in court for the ruling, wrote on Twitter 'He’s won”, before adding: 'Colossal relief here in court. Short and sweet.' In the ruling, Lord Judge said the 2003 Act, which came into force before Twitter was invented, did not create 'some newly-minted interference with the first of President Roosevelt’s essential freedoms - freedom of speech and expression. 'Satirical, or iconoclastic, or rude comment, the expression of unpopular or unfashionable opinion about serious or trivial matters, banter or humour, even if distasteful to some or painful to those subjected to it should and no doubt will continue at their customary level, quite undiminished by this legislation. 'Given the submissions by Mr Cooper, we should perhaps add that for those who have the inclination to use Twitter for the purpose, Shakespeare can be quoted unbowdlerised, and with Edgar, at the end of King Lear, they are free to speak not what they ought to say, but what they feel.' 'The more one reflected on it,' he added, 'the clearer it became that the message did not represent a terrorist threat, or any other form of threat, but was a 'conversation piece' for Mr Chambers’ followers. It was not sent to anyone at the airport or anyone responsible for airport security, or any form of public security. The language and punctuation were inconsistent with the writer intending it to be, or to be taken as, a serious warning. There was no urgent response to it from the airport and police action was 'not exactly hurried'. Celebrity support: Stephen Fry welcomed the 'complete vindication and victory' for Mr Chambers on Twitter . Lord Judge said that, while proper respect must be paid to the Crown Court’s finding, that did not address the unbroken pattern of evidence to be derived from the responses of those who read the message, and no weight appeared to have been given to the lack of urgency which characterised the approach of the authorities. Outside court, Mr Chambers said that as a result of the prosecution he had lost two jobs and become 'unemployable'. 'It’s been two-and-a-half years. At the moment I’m just feeling relieved. The Lord Chief Justice just seemed to get it.' He added: 'It’s an important decision as far as social networks are concerned and as far as Twitter is concerned. It has established that there has to be an action that is menacing and is intended to be menacing. It’s a very big decision for people doing what human beings do - telling a joke sometimes, even if it’s a bad one.' Comedian Murray, who arrived to lend his support, said the case had been 'ridiculous'. 'In 100 years there will be an operetta about this - about how ridiculous we were at the start of the 21st century. I’m a big fan of absurdity but this is taking the biscuit.' He added: 'Paul was doing what we all do sometimes in the heat of the moment.'","Paul Chambers posted the tweet in a moment of frustration after Robin Hood Airport was closed by snow in 2010 .

"Beleaguered Labour leader Ed Miliband asked former Home Secretary Alan Johnson to return to the shadow cabinet – but was turned down. Mr Johnson said he was approached by the Labour leader earlier this year but turned down the offer of a new frontline role. ‘Ed said to me a few months ago 'I suppose you're not interested in coming back?' I said 'No'. Former home secretary Alan Johnson has revealed that he was sounded out by Ed Miliband about a possible return to Labour's top team . Mr Johnson has previously ruled himself out as a contender for the Labour leadership, despite pressure from MPs who believe they would stand a much better chance in next year's general election if he replaced Mr Miliband. He insisted the party could win in May, despite Mr Miliband's dismal poll ratings, and said he had told the Labour leader he would be happy ‘to go round the country, campaigning, talking to parties’ during the election. But Mr Johnson, in an interview with Alastair Campbell for GQ magazine, indicated he could even be tempted back to the frontbench if Labour succeeded in regaining power. ‘Disgracefully - and it is disgraceful because I won't have done the heavy lifting - then I would be more interested. But I am not gagging for it,’ he said. Since standing down as shadow chancellor in 2011 after discovering his wife was having an affair with his police protection officer, Mr Johnson has carved out a successful second career as a writer, penning two best-selling volumes of his autobiography. He said he had been surprised when Mr Miliband offered him the post of shadow chancellor after becoming leader in 2010 and admitted that he had not enjoyed the job. ‘I was glad to get out. I took it because I thought, what an extraordinary gesture, that he wants me there. I was not associated with him (Mr Miliband), I'm very much a Blairite, I had not been planning to go on the front bench. But my heart wasn't in it,’ he said. ‘I was not up for it. I did it for seven months but I didn't like the job.’ Ed Miliband, giving a speech in Glasgow last week, was under pressure from MPs concerned about the party's poor polling - many of whom wanted Mr Johnson to replace him as Labour leader . Mr Johnson expressed exasperation that Labour had not been more effective in attacking Chancellor George Osborne over the economy and urged Mr Miliband to make ‘a couple of big speeches ... just taking the whole thing apart’. ‘If I feel frustrated about anything it is about not holding George Osborne to account, because his flagship policy was to clear the deficit in one term. He has totally failed,’ he said.","Labour veteran asked by Mr Miliband this year but turned down the offer .

"Meeting Santa Claus is supposed to inspire a joyous time for festivities and present swapping with the family. But judging by the looks on these children's faces they're more likely to have a nightmare before Christmas. He's known as the kindly old man who always puts a smile on kids' faces whether they see him in the chimney, tucking into milk and biscuits, leaving presents under the tree or, as is more likely, down at the shopping mall. But when the parents of these children took their little ones to meet Father Christmas they had the fright of their lives sitting on the knee of ghoulish, gloved and sinister-looking Santas.

The hilarious pictures have been posted online as parents around the country look for a Santa to take their children to in the run up to Christmas, showing how a wholesome, loveable character can easily look scary and disturb little children. Many of the wailing youngsters were probably wishing Father Christmas really didn't exist, as the one they're sitting with looks better placed in a horror film than meeting and greeting kids at a shopping centre. Some are wearing strange masks while others have wild hair and beards which make them look like they have been pulled through a hedge backwards.

"Three men were arrested after their hot tub threesome turned violent during an argument over who gets paid more for escorting. Austin Adams, 18, and Michael Gordon, 33, met 21-year-old Douglas Tench at a gay club in Spartanburg, South Carolina, on Saturday night before inviting him to the home where Gordon was dog-sitting. The trio were 'kissing and touching each other' in the hot tub at 1.30am when Tench stated he earned more from escort services than Adams - prompting Adams to lash out.

"A young woman was so desperate to find the father of her unborn son that she posted an ad on Gumtree with unexpected vitriolic responses from total strangers. Bianca Fazey, 24, had a one night stand with a man in Perth, Western Australia on April 23 this year and surprisingly discovered she was pregnant after being told in 2011 that she was unlikely to ever become a mum when she was diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome. For five months, Bianca frantically searched for the father but had no luck as she only knew his first name and what suburb he lived in. 'I was at my wits end,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'I tried finding him for months and felt pressured by a friend who was adamant I don't give up despite exhausting all avenues.' Scroll down for video . Bianca Fazey posted a Gumtree ad in an attempt to find her unborn son's father . Bianca's ad received a barrage of hateful remarks from complete strangers . This was when Bianca, who was so stressed that she was losing sleep, decided to post an ad on Gumtree which created a barrage of hateful responses prompting her to take to take it down. 'I stupidly put it up thinking no one would even see it but who knows what will happen, maybe I will get lucky,' she said. 'Unfortunately all I got was lots of judgement and idiots messaging me telling me they would be the father or pretending to be Jeremy.' The most offensive messages were from people saying that Bianca, who is due in mid January, should have opted for a termination. 'When it was shared on the LAD bible page a lot of people made single-minded comments aimed at me, no one mentioned the guy was equally a part of me getting pregnant,' she said. 'Sometimes I want to be like one of those people on Maury Povich screaming back at the audience because they have no clue what they're booing about!' Bianca was forced to take down the post but has no regrets about deciding to have the baby . Bianca (pictured before being pregnant) never thought she could have children as she suffers from polycystic ovary syndrome . Bianca wasn't exactly shocked to be called names like a 'sl**' but it got out of control when one person lashed out saying 'kill it'. 'It was sad to see people saying I should get an abortion, those were the only comments that hurt.' 'Society is still hating on women who choose to keep pregnancy outside of a relationship,' she said. 'I was more mad at the amount of women (mums included) saying I shouldn't go through with it.' But Bianca has risen above the horrendous backlash and can't wait to meet her little man when he enters the world in two months. 'All I can say is I chose to go ahead with the pregnancy because I didn't think I could have children,' she said. 'Even though I knew this guy had disappeared I didn't want to give up my chance and I'm so grateful I didn't.' Bianca is due in mid January and can't wait to meet her little man when he enters the world in two months . Despite the fall-out from the ad - Bianca has the loving support of the people who matter most - her family and friends. 'It has changed my life and made me a happier healthier person,' she said. 'I couldn't be happier, I am looking forward to holding my little guy and raising him in a loving stable environment.' She is also looking forward to getting back into shape . 'Excited to hold him and excited to start getting back in shape!' she said. 'I hate that I'm so limited physically.' Bianca still hopes the father will come forward and become an integral part of his son's life. 'I do hope that I can find him and let him know, he can make his own choice,' she said. 'But more for the sake of the kid, when he asks questions or wants to find him I want to be prepared.' She still hopes the father will come forward and become an integral part of his son's life .","Bianca Fazey had a one night stand with a man in Perth on April 23 .

"Ray Rice wasted no time celebrating his NFL reinstatement and headed to Manhattan nightclubs just hours after winning his appeal, photographs have revealed. The former Ravens running back was spotted at Bounce Sporting Club on Saturday evening, where he was happy to chat with people and give out autographs, according to TMZ. Sources told the website that he was also joined by his wife Janay, whom he knocked out in an Atlantic City casino in February, but she did not appear in any of the images. TMZ added that people at the club noted that Rice was not drinking. He swore off hard liquor after revealing that the vicious attack unfolded on an alcohol-fueled night. Night out: Ray Rice is pictured left as he enjoys a night of clubbing with friends in Manhattan on Saturday . Rice's one-punch knockout of his then fiancée put his NFL career in jeopardy and thrust the issue of domestic abuse into the national spotlight. The first video of the fight that went viral in February showed Rice calmly pulling an unconscious Palmer from the elevator and he was suspended for two games. But after TMZ obtained a second video taken inside the elevator - which showed Rice knocking her out  - he was released by the Ravens and NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell suspended him indefinitely from the league. However, an independent arbitrator on Friday said that Rice, in essence, was sanctioned twice for the same crime and ruled he was free to sign with any National Football League team. Making friends: Another image shows the football player pictured with a couple on Saturday night . The NFL said it accepted the decision, spokesman Greg Aiello said. 'Ray Rice is a free agent and has been eligible to be signed by an NFL team since he was released by the Ravens,' he said. 'Based on Judge Jones' decision, he will be eligible to play upon signing a new contract.' In a statement, Rice said:  'I would like to thank Judge Barbara Jones, the NFL Players Association, my attorneys, agents, advisers, family, friends and fans - but most importantly, my wife Janay. 'I made an inexcusable mistake and accept full responsibility for my actions. I am thankful that there was a proper appeals process in place to address this issue. I will continue working hard to improve myself and be the best husband, father and friend, while giving back to my community and helping others to learn from my mistakes.' In an interview with the Today show, Janay Rice stood up for her husband and insisted that he had never hit her prior to their fight in the New Jersey casino elevator. Shocking: Rice was suspended by the NFL for only two games following the one-punch knockout of his then-fiancée in an elevator at the New Jersey casino in February. CCTV captured the attack . By his side: Despite the vicious attack, Janay and Ray Rice (pictured in November) married in March . Painful: Janay Rice wipes away a tear on the Today show on Monday as she recounts how angry she was after a video emerged showing her now-husband knocking her out cold in an elevator in February . 'There's no way,' she said in the interview that aired on Monday. 'He knows what he would have to deal with. I'm not going to sit there in silence and let something happen to me and, God forbid, in front of my child.' After the incident, she said that she initially thought she was 'done' with Rice - but her 'heart' told her to stay with him because it was not like him. 'Everybody makes mistakes,' she said. 'You would think that we lived in a country of people who have never made a mistake, who've never sinned ever in their life.' While Rice is now free to join any club, it remains unclear if any team will sign the 27-year-old, three-time Pro Bowl running back.","Ray Rice was pictured partying with friends on Saturday night .

"The Chancellor insists there will be no political tax breaks because Britain must ‘stay the course to prosperity’ George Osborne has ruled out any traditional pre-election giveaways in this week’s Autumn Statement. The Chancellor insists there will be no political tax breaks because Britain must ‘stay the course to prosperity’. ‘What you’re going to see is me avoiding the mistakes of Labour chancellors before elections with unfunded giveaways that lead to economic problems after the election,’ he said. A report out today warns that the Government will have to borrow £9billion more than expected this year as tax receipts disappoint. This means the Chancellor will not be able to deliver the budget surplus he has promised until 2019-20 – a year late. And it casts doubt on his plans for £7billion of tax cuts for the middle classes after the election. ‘The improvement in the public finances is in danger of not just stalling but going into reverse,’ says Marin Beck in the report for the Ernst & Young Item Club. ‘With the fiscal cupboard bare, the Chancellor will have little room for manoeuvre.’ Mr Osborne can expect a boost from the Office for Budget Responsibility this week with an upward revision of economic growth forecasts. But the Item Club warns ‘that’s where the good news is likely to end’ as subdued wage growth and the big increase in the tax free allowance to £10,500 hits tax receipts. Borrowing hit a record high of £153billion in 2009-10 as the last Labour government lost control of the public finances in the Great Recession. The deficit fell to £97.5billion last year but progress has stalled and the Government borrowed £64.1billion in the first seven months of this fiscal year. That is £3.7billion more than in the equivalent period of 2013-14. The increase in borrowing means the Chancellor will struggle to meet his target of cutting the deficit by another £11billion this year – with the Item Club expecting it to come in at £95.5billion. ‘With just five months to go it appears virtually impossible for the Government to achieve the OBR’s current forecast for borrowing in 2014-15,’ Mr Beck said. Labour leader Ed Miliband will today claim that the Tories’ failure to tackle what he calls a cost-of-living crisis has helped cost the Exchequer £116.5billion since 2010. Labour leader Ed Miliband will today claim that the Tories’ failure to tackle what he calls a cost-of-living crisis has helped cost the Exchequer £116.5billion since 2010 . The price tag – equivalent to almost £4,000 for every taxpayer – is based on new research from the House of Commons Library being published by Labour. Depressed pay combined with soaring housing costs and the failure to tackle the causes of increased welfare bills, means tax receipts have fallen short by £66 billion, national insurance contributions are £25.5billion lower than expected and spending on social security is £25billion higher than planned. ‘For all the Government’s boasts about a belated economic recovery, there are millions of families still caught in the most prolonged cost-of-living crisis for a century. For them this is a joyless and payless recovery,’ Mr Miliband will say. But Mr Osborne told the BBC: ‘We’ve created more jobs in this country under this government than the rest of Europe put together. ‘We’ve had the fastest fall in unemployment in this country’s history. So those are real outcomes for real people. ‘We shouldn’t face this false choice of either bankrupting the country or having decent public services.’","Chancellor says Britain must ‘stay the course to prosperity’

"Revolution? Customers can find out about their ancestry by spitting into a tube and paying £125 . A test to tell if you are at risk from Alzheimer’s disease and dozens of other conditions goes on sale in Britain today costing £125. The test uses a saliva sample to provide more than 100 pieces of genetic information including whether users are more likely than normal to suffer Parkinson’s, some cancers or baldness. It can also predict whether they like coffee or hate Brussels sprouts, which type of exercise is likely to suit them best and give information about a person’s ancestry. The test, already available in the US, is being marketed online by 23andMe, a firm part-funded by Google. A customer spits into a tube, seals it and sends it back to 23andMe’s labs for analysis. Four to six weeks later, they receive a detailed report in the post written in everyday language. It will tell them, for instance, whether their risk of Alzheimer’s disease is higher or lower than average. 23andMe – run by Anne Wojcicki, wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin – says its ‘mission is to ensure that individuals can personally access, understand and benefit from the human genome’. It says that armed with the information, people can take better care of their health. For instance, the print-out may give someone the impetus they need to give up smoking or it could mean they undergo regular health checks so that an illness can be caught – and treated early. Genetic tests are already available in Britain but generally provide less information and are more expensive. However, critics say the science behind such analysis is not is not advanced enough to provide worthwhile results. This could lead to some people being falsely reassured, others worrying unnecessarily or facing higher insurance premiums and the NHS being put under added pressure. Genome: Tests on DNA are also available in Britain, but provide less information and are more expensive . The firm has been banned from providing some information from the tests to customers in the US over fears it would lead to people seeking out treatment they do not need. The US health watchdog, the Food and Drug Administration, was particularly concerned about information provided on one gene, BRCA, that raises the odds of breast and ovarian cancer. It said: ‘For instance, if the BRCA-related risk assessment for breast or ovarian cancer reports a false positive, it could lead a patient to undergo prophylactic surgery, chemoprevention, intensive screening, or other morbidity-inducing actions, while a false negative could result in a failure to recognise an actual risk that may exist.’ There are also concerns that someone told they have a higher risk of an incurable condition such as Alzheimer’s may take a fatalistic approach and stop looking after their health. Mark Thomas of UCL said: ‘For better or worse, genetic testing companies are here to stay' Professor Sally Hodgson, an expert in cancer genetics from St George’s Hospital in South London, said DNA analysis is ‘very open to misunderstanding’. She warned that the results could cause ‘undue and inappropriate anxiety’ and said that valuable NHS time could be taken up by people requesting further tests. Mark Thomas, professor of evolutionary genetics at University College London, said: ‘For better or worse, direct-to-the-consumer genetic testing companies are here to stay. 'One could argue the rights and wrongs of such companies existing, but I suspect that ship has sailed. 23andMe have enormous resources and leading scientists on their advisory board. ‘Nonetheless, it is important that independent scientists and government bodies remain vigilant to ensure that such companies produce scientifically accurate, responsibly formatted and non-alarmist reports to their customers.’ 23andMe already has some British users and says most find the information ‘extremely valuable’. Only 4 per cent have made an appointment with their doctor based on the results or asked for further tests. The firm says it has spoken to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency to ensure its test complies with UK regulations.","Test is part-funded by Google and is already widely available in the U.S.

"The inquiry into Establishment child abuse could take up to four years to complete, its new chairman has revealed. Lowell Goddard, a High Court judge in New Zealand, said leading the probe was the 'biggest challenge' she has ever faced as she set out plans to start in April. The inquiry has already lost two potential heads, Baroness Butler-Sloss and Dame Fiona Woolf, who stood aside amid concerns over their establishment links. Lowell Goddard, a High Court judge in New Zealand, said leading the probe could last up to four years . Home Secretary Theresa May was forced to scour the globe to find a chairman for the inquiry, after fears leading figures in the UK would be seen as too close to the Establishment. Giving evidence to MPs, Judge Goddard, the third chair-designate of the Statutory Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse, told the Home Affairs Select Committee she was reluctant to set a timescale for the inquiry as this stage. But she said it had been indicated when she took the job that it could take 'three years, possibly into a fourth'. She added: 'Given the breadth of the subject matter and the timespan involved, that does not seem inordinate. 'It is a long time but what will be important, in my view, is to carefully scope the inquiry to see how it should be managed and to inform along the way of the progress of the inquiry and perhaps to set milestones for interim reports.' Mrs May has insisted she is confident that thorough checks have been carried out to ensure there are no conflicts of interest that could undermine her appointment. Mrs Goddard, arriving at Parliament to give evidence to MPs, said the inquiry was her biggest ever challenger . Labour MP Keith Vaz, the committee chairman, asked Judge Goddard: 'Would you regard yourself as being part of the establishment?' She replied: 'We don't have such a thing in my country and I did have to ask carefully what is meant by it so that I did understand what I was being asked to disclose. 'My understanding is do I have any links into any institution or any person relevant to the subject matter of the inquiry? And no, I don't.' Judge Goddard said she arrived in the UK yesterday and had already met the Home Secretary and sex abuse survivor groups. She told the committee she will step down from her full-time job as a judge in New Zealand and relocate to the UK for the duration of the inquiry, although she has yet to be awarded a work permit. Her husband will join her in the UK as often as he can, but her grown up children will remain in New Zealand. 'It is the biggest challenge I have faced yet,' she told MPs. The Home Office received more than 150 nominations from survivors, their representatives, MPs and members of the public, Mrs May said. The Foreign Office was also tasked with combing the Commonwealth to identify any suitable candidates from abroad. It will be a new statutory inquiry, and not a Royal Commission as some victims had hoped. With a legal status set out under the 2005 Inquiries Act, it will have the power to compel witnesses to give evidence. New inquiry chairman Justice Lowell Goddard . Ministers scoured the globe in search of a suitable chairman for the child abuse inquiry, after two previous appointees resigned over links to the British Establishment. The Foreign Office approached all Commonwealth countries, and the decision was made to appoint Justice Lowell Goddard, a serving High Court judge in New Zealand. The 66-year-old helped to establish the HELP Clinic for sexual abuse victims, and helped to change the way New Zealand police dealt with abuse cases. In 2007 she was appointed chairman of the Independent Police Conduct Authority. During her tenure the authority released a report on the outcome of its inquiry into police handling of child abuse cases, which had begun in August 2009. She has also served as an independent expert to the United Nations Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture. Home Secretary Theresa May said: 'She is an outstanding candidate with experience in challenging authority in this field, having led with distinction an inquiry into police handling of child abuse cases in New Zealand.' Married to QC John Hodson, Miss Goddard has three step-children, and one daughter from her first marriage. She breeds and races horses. Last week Mrs May announced the original inquiry would be axed and replaced with a new panel. She conceded that not every victim would be happy with what she announced today. But she told MPs: 'Let me be clear. I am now more determined than ever to expose the people behind these despicable crimes and the people in institutions that knew about abuse but didn't act, that failed to help when it was their duty, sometimes their very purpose to do so. 'And the people and institutions that in some cases positively covered up evidence of abuse. 'What we have seen so far in Rotherham, Oxford, Greater Manchester and elsewhere is only the tip of the iceberg. 'With every passing day, with every new revelation, it is clear that sexual abuse of child has taken and is taking place on a scale that we still cannot fully comprehend.' She said the authorities had 'let down too many' victims over many years, telling MPs: 'I cannot stand here and say there has been no cover-up.' At the time she said the inquiry will take longer than 12 months, but must not be allow to 'go on endlessly', Mrs May added. She will urge Miss Goddard to set a date to publish a report, to prevent a repeat of the Chilcot Inquiry into the Iraq war which has not been published after six years. The inquiry has been dogged with problems since it was first announced by Mrs May last summer. The panel of experts was created to examine evidence that successive governments, charities, political parties, the NHS, the BBC and the Church failed to protect children from paedophiles. But it has failed to make any significant progress after losing not one but two chairman. The first person appointed to lead the inquiry was Baroness Butler-Sloss, who stood down in July last year amid questions over the role played by her late brother, Lord Havers, who was attorney general in the 1980s. Her replacement Dame Fiona Woolf then resigned following a barrage of criticism over her 'Establishment links', most notably in relation to former home secretary Leon Brittan, who died last month. Before his death, Lord Brittan had been seen as a key witness to give evidence to the inquiry over a dossier he received from MP Geoffrey Dickens in 1983, documenting the alleged involvement of VIP figures in a child sex ring. The Government's inquiry into historical child abuse has been plagued with controversy since it was established last year. Here are the key events: . Monday July 7: Home Secretary Theresa May announces she will establish an independent inquiry under an expert panel to examine the handling of allegations of paedophilia by state institutions as well as bodies such as the BBC, churches and political parties. It will be chaired by 'an appropriately senior and experienced figure', she tells the House of Commons. Tuesday July 8: Baroness Butler-Sloss is named as the chairwoman but questions are raised about the choice as her brother, Sir Michael Havers, was in the Cabinet in the 1980s as attorney general. Leon Brittan, who died last month, had been seen as a key witness likely to be called to give evidence to the inquiry . Saturday July 12: Claims emerge that Baroness Butler-Sloss once refused to go public about a bishop implicated in a scandal. She is reported to have told a victim of alleged abuse she did not want to include their claims in a review of how the Church of England dealt with two paedophile priests because she 'cared about the Church' and 'the press would love a bishop'. Monday July 14: Downing Street announces that Baroness Butler-Sloss has decided to quit. Friday September 5: The Lord Mayor of the City of London, Fiona Woolf, a former president of the Law Society of England and Wales, is named as the new chairman. Sunday September 7: The Mail on Sunday reveals links between Mrs Woolf and Lord Brittan, who was likely to be called to give evidence to the inquiry over a dossier he received from Mr Dickens in 1983, documenting the alleged involvement of VIP figures in a child sex ring. Labour MP Simon Danczuk, who has led the campaign for an inquiry, says Mrs Woolf's position would be 'untenable' if she was close to the Brittans. Monday September 8: Downing Street says Prime Minister David Cameron continues to have 'strong support' for the appointment. Tuesday October 21: Mrs May insists she has confidence in the inquiry chairwoman after Mrs Woolf gives details of her links to Lord Brittan. Mrs Woolf insists there is nothing in the encounters that would stop her chairing the wide-ranging probe. Giving evidence later to the Home Affairs Select Committee, Mrs Woolf insists she has 'gone the extra distance' to declare every possible issue to reassure victims and does not have a 'close association' with the former Cabinet minister. Wednesday October 22: As pressure mounts on Mrs Woolf to stand down, a photograph surfaces showing her chatting to Lady Brittan at a prize-giving in October 2013 - she had previously stated that she had had 'no social contact with Lord and Lady Brittan since April 23 2013'. Friday October 31: Mrs Woolf quits down as head of the inquiry, after victims' representatives issued a unanimous call for her to be replaced. Monday November 3: Mrs May apologies to survivors during a Commons statement and says she will meet survivors before appointing a new chair. Tuesday November 11: A key review into the Home Office's handling of allegations finds there is no evidence of organised attempts to conceal child abuse. It came after it emerged the department 'lost or destroyed' 114 files between 1979 and 1999. Thursday December 4: A number of alleged victims write to Mrs May saying they will withdraw from the inquiry unless the Government makes major changes to it. Sunday December 21: Survivors say they welcome an indication from the Home Secretary that the inquiry will be given statutory powers, including the ability to compel witnesses to give evidence. Wednesday January 21:  Leon Brittan dies as the age of 75. Wednesday February 4: Mrs May is expected to announce the new chair and her possible plans for a new format of the inquiry, which could potentially involve scrapping the existing panel and replacing it with a more powerful body.","Lowell Goddard, a High Court judge in New Zealand, to lead the probe .

Margarita spoke out from her apartment in Elmhurst, Queens, for the first time since being identified by NYPD detectives as Baby Hope's mother. She refused to open the door for reporters, but could be heard sobbing as she described learning that Baby Hope was her missing child. 'We are too emotional to talk right now because of everything we are going through. You wouldn’t understand my pain,' Margarita Castillo said. 'We are just waiting for justice. We are not going to have peace. You can't even describe a punishment.' The mother of ten, who has children by three different men, is an illegal immigrant. Some neighbors say she didn't come forward because she feared deportation. Others don't buy that explanation. 'Killer': Conrado Juarez being walked from the NYPD Cold Case Precinct in Brooklyn,  on Saturday. Juarez allegedly confessed to the rape and murder of the long-unidentified 'Baby Hope' In custody: Juarez, 52, was arraigned on Saturday at Manhattan Criminal Court for the alleged murder of 4-year-old Anjelica Castillo, nicknamed 'Baby Hope', in New York . 'I don't believe that. I don't believe that's true. They look like they are very aware. They're educated so I don't believe it,' neighbor Omar Delarosa told WABC-TV. NYPD detectives arrested Conrado Juarez, 52, a cousin of Anjelica, this weekend after a break in the notorious cold case. Juarez confessed to tying the girl to a table then sexually assaulting her and smothering her with a pillow when she wouldn't stop screaming. The attack occurred at his sister's house in the Bronx. When his sister, who died years later, found out, she demanded that Juarez dispose of the body. He confessed to stuffing her in a blue cooler and dumping her along the Henry Hudson Parkway. She was found by construction workers on July 23, 1991. A law enforcement official told NBC 4 . New York that Margarita Castillo claims Anjelica's father took her and several of her daughters to live with family members. He then returned to his native Mexico. Margarita is said to claim she lived in fear of the baby's father . and was afraid to go to police after her daughter disappeared. It was not until she was reunited with all of her children years later that she realized Anjelica was gone, she says.","Baby Hope, whose name has been revealed as Anjelica Castillo, was tortured in the time leading up to her murder .

"She made her name by giving outspoken advice on what not to wear. But now Susannah Constantine is the one being criticised – over some very controversial accessories brandished by her young daughter. Keen hunter Miss Constantine shared a picture of ten-year-old Cece proudly clutching a dead duck and with her face smeared with blood to mark her first kill. The little girl is also shown holding guns and taking part in hunts in a series of photos dating back almost a year and published on her and her mother’s public Instagram profiles. The photographs are accompanied by captions such as ‘First duck’ and ‘No food left after Christmas. Cece off to save the day’. Scroll down for video . Her first kill: With blood smeared across her face, a smiling Cece, 10, poses with the dead duck . Taking aim: Cece, holding a gun with sister Esme, 13, in a picture that was posted recently on Instagram . But Miss Constantine has been condemned by animal rights campaigners, who claimed the pictures call into question her abilities as a mother and branded the decision to let a child hunt ‘depressing’, ‘irresponsible’ and ‘dangerous’. Miss Constantine – who found fame alongside Trinny Woodall as one half of television fashion advisers Trinny and Susannah – began hunting at the age of seven around the Leicestershire village of Knipton where she grew up. The daughter of a Coldstream Guard, Miss Constantine boarded from the age of 11 at the £6,950-a-term St Mary’s School in Oxfordshire and was once labelled a ‘snob’ by Carol Vorderman. She has dated Viscount Linley and Pakistani cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan, and is now married to Danish businessman Sten Bertelsen, with whom she has three children – Joe, 15, Esme, 13, and Cece. But the 52-year-old’s privileged background and lifelong passion for hunting has done little to appease her critics, with a spokesman for Animal Aid saying there is ‘no justification for putting a weapon into the hands of a child’. The sentiment was echoed by a spokesman for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, who said: ‘Susannah’s mothering skills have to be called into question, as she’s evidently failed to convey the most basic lesson of “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you”.’ Star duo: Trinny and Susannah made their name by giving outspoken advice on what not to wear . Family: Susannah with husband Sten Bertelsen, with whom she has three children – Joe,  Esme and Cece . Michael Stephenson, of the League Against Cruel Sports, added: ‘We believe parents have a responsibility to teach their kids to respect and enjoy wildlife. We don’t believe children should be killing wildlife full stop and have always expressed concern at children being exposed to blood sports.’ Miss Constantine has long been vocal about her love of hunting. In an interview as far back as 1990, she said: ‘I am fit because I hunt every weekend with the Belvoir in Leicestershire, where my parents live and I was brought up … it is relaxing because when you’re in the saddle you have to concentrate entirely on what you are doing’. Miss Constantine declined to comment when contacted about the picture of her daughter, saying: ‘It was a private day.’","Keen hunter Susannah Constantine shared picture of daughter Cece .

"Read the full match report from the Australian Open men's final in Melbourne . Andy Murray allowed himself to be mugged in this Australian Open final. He knows it, and so does Novak Djokovic. The angry cracking of two rackets back at his chair after a cursory handshake at the net spoke more articulately than the Scot’s more measured reflections after a shattering defeat by his long-time rival. The smashing of his implements was a way of expressing what he felt about getting distracted by Djokovic’s Oscar-contending displays of frailty. Andy Murray loses his cool during the 7-6, 6-7, 6-3, 6-0 defeat to Novak Djokovic in Melbourne . The British No 1 won only 34 per cent of points on his weak second serve in the final . Murray looks on as world No 1 Djokovic gives his winner's speech . ‘I play enough matches to be able to handle that situation better,’ he admitted. But while the wildly undulating physical demeanour of the champion is what will be remembered about this encounter, there were more prosaic reasons for the result. A continuing problem for Murray is his second serve, which still requires a protection order to be slapped on it. He may have varied it better at this event but it is still too vulnerable. Djokovic won 62 per cent of his second serves to Murray’s 34 per cent, but it was 15mph faster. More startlingly, the 83mph average of the Murray second delivery in the final was 10mph slower than Serena Williams and 12mph slower than Maria Sharapova managed in the women’s final. Murray seemed distracted by Djokovic's requests for medical attention during the game . Murray's fiancee Kim Sears looks up at the big screen in Melbourne after they notice her choice of top . The former Wimbledon champion takes his frustration out on a pair of rackets . Former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash has accused Andy Murray of losing the plot . He lacked the same ruthlessness as Djokovic, particularly in the way he allowed himself to become distracted by the drama at the other end of the court as his opponent went through his physical troughs. You see this kind of thing happening more commonly in junior tennis, one player being befuddled by another’s struggles. More profoundly, you have to take your chances when they present themselves against the best. Murray could have won all three sets, having been 4-2 up in the first tiebreak and 2-0 up in the third set, which was the time when the hammer had to come down. Yet in comparing him with Djokovic, we are judging him by stratospheric standards, and that should not be overlooked. Indeed, it is possible that the unfolding story of this year in men’s tennis will be whether anybody can mount a credible challenge to the 27-year-old, whose game is near impenetrable. Djokovic gives Murray a backwards glance as he holds the Australian Open winner's trophy . The Scot tries not to watch as Djokovic kisses the trophy after his four set victory . Djokovic and his team, including coach Boris Becker (right), celebrate in the locker room . If there is a volunteer for the role it might turn out to be Murray, seeing the improvements that he has come up with since returning from the off-season. Taken as a whole, his form here has been immensely encouraging, a swift turnaround after the shambolic way he ended last year with an embarrassing defeat by Roger Federer and abrupt changes in his coaching team. He played impressively in the lead-up during some competitive exhibitions, and then showed that was no mirage in particularly outstanding performances to beat Grigor Dimitrov and Tomas Berdych. The necessary aggression was there to see. Murray lost his way after winning the second set and going 2-0 up in the third set . Murray screams as he comes up short in the sixth grand slam final of his career . The Scot's coach Amelie Mauresmo accepts that her charge's performance was not good enough . While the 6-0 scoreline in Sunday's final set looks ugly, it was apparent that whoever won the third set could romp away with it. The damage was done then, and that is what will keep Murray awake on the flight back to London. Coach Amelie Mauresmo’s reaction later deserves as much weight as that from scathing BBC commentators such as Pat Cash and John Lloyd. ‘It wasn’t enough, it is not yet enough,’ she said. ‘You can see Novak produced his best play at the important moments. Novak served really well — better than Andy. The two things made the difference. These are two really good weeks compared to the end of last year, but to beat Djokovic, who is superb, it is not yet enough. ‘We have already made important progress — the little things are still to be worked on. There is not a lot of frustration. It is really a step forward. There remains a big one to make and we are going to try to do it. ‘The improvement he has made since the end of last year and then the first month and first Grand Slam is really positive. We will all look back on where he has come from to where he is at now. Still there are a few steps to climb before holding a Grand Slam trophy again, but the gap is closing.’ The new rankings will back up that assertion, with Murray up from No 6 to No 4 in the world. He is in familiar company, with the trinity of Djokovic, Nadal and Federer. But after an Australian Open that always had swirling undercurrents of acrimony, Djokovic is in a group of one right now.

"A Lithuanian builder has appeared in court accused of the double murder of a married couple who were found stabbed to death at their £750,000 home in Surrey. Viktoras Bruzas, 38, is accused of murdering Patrick Kettyle, 55, and his wife Gillian, 54, who were discovered at the semi-detached property in Fetcham shortly after midnight on Thursday last week. Their deaths sparked a police search for  Bruzas, 38, who was arrested 18 hours later in nearby Oxshott. Lithuanian builder Viktoras Bruzas, 38, (left)  has been charged with murder after the bodies of married couple Patrick (right), 55, and Gillian Kettyle, 54, were discovered at their Surrey home on Thursday . Bruzas pictured leaving Guildford Crown Court today after appearing charged with two counts of murder . The self-employed builder, from Walton-on-Thames, appeared at Guildford Crown Court today charged with two counts of murder. He had appeared briefly at South East Surrey Magistrates' Court in Redhill, Surrey, on Saturday, when his case was sent straight to the crown court. With short brown hair and wearing a grey jumper, Bruzas spoke only to confirm his name as he appeared in the dock. Judge Christopher Critchlow, Honorary Recorder of Guildford, transferred the case to the Old Bailey in central London. Bruzas, who was wearing a grey jumper, spoke only to confirm his name during the hearing . Kristina Bruziene, the ex wife of Bruzas, was employed by the couple as a secretary in 2012 . Bruzas, who moved to England in 2008, was remanded in custody. The next hearing will be at the Central Criminal Court, the Old Bailey, on December 19. Initial post mortem examinations show the couple died as the result of multiple knife wounds. A weapon was found near their home after detectives began a forensic search of the area. Police say Bruzas and the Kettyle family were known to each. Mr Kettyle had employed Bruzas’s ex-wife, Kristina Bruziene, 37, as a secretary at his million-pound building and property development firm. He ran the company from his home, while his wife worked as a facilities manager at Cargill Plc in Cobham, Surrey. Bruzas grew up in Kaunas, Lithuania, the country’s second biggest city, 65 miles west of the capital, Vilnius. He married his wife in Lithuania before they moved to the UK in their twenties. The couple settled in Forest Gate, East London, and had their son Richard, who was born in September 2007. Relatives described the couple as 'really lovely people' who did not deserve what happened to them. A forensics officer collects a knife in Fetcham, Surrey (right).

"Met Office releases new figures which show no warming in 15 years . The supposed ‘consensus’ on man-made global warming is facing an inconvenient challenge after the release of new temperature data showing the planet has not warmed for the past 15 years. The figures suggest that we could even be heading for a mini ice age to rival the 70-year temperature drop that saw frost fairs held on the Thames in the 17th Century. Based on readings from more than 30,000 measuring stations, the data was issued last week without fanfare by the Met Office and the University of East Anglia Climatic Research Unit. It confirms that the rising trend in world temperatures ended in 1997. A painting, dated 1684, by Abraham Hondius depicts one of many frost fairs on the River Thames during the mini ice age . Meanwhile, leading climate scientists yesterday told The Mail on Sunday that, after emitting unusually high levels of energy throughout the 20th Century, the sun is now heading towards a ‘grand minimum’ in its output, threatening cold summers, bitter winters and a shortening of the season available for growing food. Solar output goes through 11-year cycles, with high numbers of sunspots seen at their peak. We are now at what should be the peak of what scientists call ‘Cycle 24’ – which is why last week’s solar storm resulted in sightings of the aurora borealis further south than usual. But sunspot numbers are running at less than half those seen during cycle peaks in the 20th Century. Analysis by experts at NASA and the University of Arizona – derived from magnetic-field measurements 120,000 miles beneath the sun’s surface – suggest that Cycle 25, whose peak is due in 2022, will be a great deal weaker still. According to a paper issued last week by the Met Office, there is a  92 per cent chance that both Cycle 25 and those taking place in the following decades will be as weak as, or weaker than, the ‘Dalton minimum’ of 1790 to 1830. In this period, named after the meteorologist John Dalton, average temperatures in parts of Europe fell by 2C. However, it is also possible that the new solar energy slump could be as deep as the ‘Maunder minimum’ (after astronomer Edward Maunder), between 1645 and 1715 in the coldest part of the ‘Little Ice Age’ when, as well as the Thames frost fairs, the canals of Holland froze solid. Yet, in its paper, the Met Office claimed that the consequences now would be negligible – because the impact of the sun on climate is far less than man-made carbon dioxide. Although the sun’s output is likely to decrease until 2100, ‘This would only cause a reduction in global temperatures of 0.08C.’ Peter Stott, one of the authors, said: ‘Our findings suggest  a reduction of solar activity to levels not seen in hundreds of years would be insufficient to offset the dominant influence of greenhouse gases.’ These findings are fiercely disputed by other solar experts. ‘World temperatures may end up a lot cooler than now for 50 years or more,’ said Henrik Svensmark, director of the Center for Sun-Climate Research at Denmark’s National Space Institute. ‘It will take a long battle to convince some climate scientists that the sun is important. It may well be that the sun is going to demonstrate this on its own, without the need for their help.’ He pointed out that, in claiming the effect of the solar minimum would be small, the Met Office was relying on the same computer models that are being undermined by the current pause in global-warming. CO2 levels have continued to rise without interruption and, in 2007, the Met Office claimed that global warming was about to ‘come roaring back’. It said that between 2004 and 2014 there would be an overall increase of 0.3C. In 2009, it predicted that at least three of the years 2009 to 2014 would break the previous temperature record set in 1998. So far there is no sign of any of this happening. But yesterday a Met Office spokesman insisted its models were still valid. ‘The ten-year projection remains groundbreaking science. The period for the original projection is not over yet,’ he said. Dr Nicola Scafetta, of Duke University in North Carolina, is the author of several papers that argue the Met Office climate models show there should have been ‘steady warming from 2000 until now’. ‘If temperatures continue to stay flat or start to cool again, the divergence between the models and recorded data will eventually become so great that the whole scientific community will question the current theories,’ he said. He believes that as the Met Office model attaches much greater significance to CO2 than to the sun, it was bound to conclude that there would not be cooling. ‘The real issue is whether the model itself is accurate,’ Dr Scafetta said. Meanwhile, one of America’s most eminent climate experts, Professor Judith Curry of the  Georgia Institute of Technology, said she found the Met Office’s confident prediction of a ‘negligible’ impact difficult to understand. ‘The responsible thing to do would be to accept the fact that the models may have severe shortcomings when it comes to the influence of the sun,’ said Professor Curry. As for the warming pause, she said that many scientists ‘are not surprised’. She argued it is becoming evident that factors other than CO2 play an important role in rising or falling warmth, such as the 60-year water temperature cycles in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. ‘They have insufficiently been appreciated in terms of global climate,’ said Prof Curry. When both oceans were cold in the past, such as from 1940 to 1970, the climate cooled. The Pacific cycle ‘flipped’ back from warm to cold mode in 2008 and the Atlantic is also thought likely to flip in the next few years . Pal Brekke, senior adviser at the Norwegian Space Centre, said some scientists found the importance of water cycles difficult to accept, because doing so means admitting that the oceans – not CO2 – caused much of the global warming between 1970 and 1997. The same goes for the impact of the sun – which was highly active for much of the 20th Century. ‘Nature is about to carry out a very interesting experiment,’ he said. ‘Ten or 15 years from now, we will be able to determine much better whether the warming of the late 20th Century really was caused by man-made CO2, or by natural variability.’ Meanwhile, since the end of last year, world temperatures have fallen by more than half a degree, as the cold ‘La Nina’ effect has re-emerged in the South Pacific. ‘We’re now well into the second decade of the pause,’ said Benny Peiser, director of the Global Warming Policy Foundation. ‘If we don’t see convincing evidence of global warming by 2015, it will start to become clear whether the models are bunk. And, if they are, the implications for some scientists could be very serious.’",Met Office releases new figures which show no warming in 15 years .
"A felon with a long rap sheet testified Tuesday that a woman paid him $5,000 to kill her ex-husband in 2012 during a child custody court case that police said had millions of dollars at stake. The testimony in Hartford Superior Court came on the first day of the trial of 39-year-old Tiffany Stevens, formerly of Bloomfield, who has pleaded not guilty to attempted murder. The felon, John McDaid of Granville, Massachusetts, also testified that Stevens threatened to have him and his children killed if he didn't follow through on the murder-for-hire. First day of her trial: John McDaid told a Connecticut court Tuesday that Tiffany Stevens, 39, offered him $5,000 to kill her ex Eric Stevens in 2012. Stevens is seen walking with her father Edward Khalily (right) on the first day of her trial in Hartford on Tuesday . McDaid, who said he had a criminal record dating back to the 1970s including 22 felony convictions, said he didn't follow through on the plan and instead told Stevens' ex-husband, who reported it to police . The alleged murder-for-hire plot in 2012, which was never carried out, occurred as Stevens and her ex-husband were involved in a child custody court case. Police say whoever got custody of the Stevens' daughter would control a $50 million trust fund . For more than a year, Eric and Tiffany Stevens battled over the rights to the eight-year-old girl, and control of a $50 million fund that is linked to her custody. McDaid, who said he had a criminal record dating back to the 1970s including 22 felony convictions, said he didn't follow through on the plan and instead told Stevens' ex-husband, who reported it to police. McDaid said he spent the $5,000 on a washer, dryer, clothes for his children and other items while leading Tiffany Stevens to believe he was going to carry out the plot. 'Find somebody. I want him killed,' McDaid said Tiffany Stevens told him, adding, 'I honestly almost didn't think it was real.' McDaid said Stevens asked him 'incessantly' over several months when her ex-husband would be killed and accused him of abusing her. In April 2012, while McDaid was working as a maintenance man for a wealthy Simsbury couple, he said Tiffany Stevens, who knew the couple, slapped an envelope containing $5,000 across his chest and said, 'Get it done.' McDaid also testified he used a computer audio program to secretly record Stevens talking about the murder-for-hire plot. Her lawyers, Hubert Santos and Trent LaLima, are trying to prevent the purported audiotape of her and McDaid from being used as evidence during the trial. On Tuesday, they raised the possibility that the recording could have been tampered with. Judge Edward J. Mullarkey has yet to rule on their motion. The trial is scheduled to continue Wednesday afternoon and last until at least next week. The way they were: Tiffany Stevens, who is free on $1 million bail, has custody of her daughter, despite the attempted murder case. Eric Stevens is seeking custody of the girl in family court; he says he doesn't know where his daughter is . Sordid: Simsbury police Sgt.

"A teenager from Minneapolis has been charged with supporting the so-called Islamic State after he was arrested while allegedly on his way to join the insurgent group. Abdullahi Yusuf, 18, was stopped at Minneapolis airport before he could board a plane to Turkey, the country which most wannabe jihadists pass through to reach terror group's strongholds in Syria. Agents are still looking for 20-year-old Abdi Nur, a contact of Yusuf's, who left for Istanbul, the Turkish capital, the next day and didn't return. Islamic State fighters: A teenager from Minneapolis has been charged with supporting the terrorist group after he was arrested at an airport allegedly en-route to join their ranks in war-torn Syria . A fighter waves the ISIS flag in Raqqa, Syria:Abdullahi Yusuf, 18, was stopped at Minneapolis airport before he could board a plane to Turkey, but his alleged accomplice Abdi Nur boarded a plane the next day . Both have been charged with 'conspiracy to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization, namely, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL),' said Assistant Attorney General John Carlin. Nur also is charged with providing material support to a foreign terror group. U.S. Attorney Andy Luger said both young men conspired to join the Islamic State 'to engage in a campaign of terror in support of a violent ideology.' Yusuf, a student at Inver Hills Community College who lives in Inver Grove Heights, a suburb of St Paul, appeared in U.S. District Court in Minneapolis yesterday, after he was first arrested in late May. His attorney argued for his release, noting he had been going to school and work despite knowing for months that he was under investigation. But a magistrate judge ordered him held until a detention hearing Wednesday. Both Yusuf and Nur are Americans of Somali descent. The charges come after FBI officials last summer said they had begun tracking a trickle of Somali-Americans from Minneapolis to Islamic State-held areas in Syria. According to a criminal complaint unsealed yesterday, Nur was a Facebook 'friend' of Mohamed Abdullahi Hassan, a man also known as Miski who was indicted in Minneapolis in 2009 on charges of being involved with Al Shabaab. The complaint said Hassan remained a fugitive. It said Yusuf, who came to the attention of the FBI after a tip-off from passport office workers, was an 'associate' of a person identified only as 'H.M.', a former Minnesota resident now believed to be fighting in Syria. According to the complaint, a passport specialist noticed Yusuf didn't have a specific itinerary, the name of a hotel or details about a person he claimed he was going to see in Istanbul. The specialist also noticed Yusuf became nervous. He alerted his supervisor, who went to the FBI. Education: Inver Hills Community College in Inver Grove Heights, where Yusuf was a student . Arrest: Yusuf was picked up by FBI agents as he tried to board a plane at Minneapolis St Paul Airport . Court documents claim that after the passport office tip-off FBI agents watched Yusuf as he opened a bank account and deposited $1,500 that he used to buy a plane ticket to Turkey. On May 28, the FBI watched as Yusuf's father drove him to school. About an hour later, Yusuf walked to a mosque, then was picked up in a Volkswagen Jetta that authorities say Nur had been driving in recent days. It is claimed that during the short car journey Yusuf changed clothes while the driver helped him pack items into a duffel bag and backpack, ABC News reports. The car dropped Yusuf to a light rail station from where he made his way to the airport. Agents arrested Yusuf before he was able to board his flight. When they told him they believed he wanted to travel to Syria to join a terrorist group, Yusuf is alleged to have said: 'I never committed no terrorist crimes that you're accusing me of.' Authorities tried to find Nur after learning he was connected to the car. But the FBI learned on May 29 that Nur had left Minneapolis that day for Istanbul. The criminal complaint said Nur had become 'much more religious' in the two months before his departure and spoke about jihad. After he left for Turkey, a witness went to a mosque that Nur attended in Bloomington, a Minneapolis suburb, and confronted several people, according to court documents. Investigators said Nur also had been communicating on Facebook with another Minneapolis man who authorities believe went to Somalia in 2008 to join al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab. Fightback: Iraqi military armored trucks pass next to a building painted in the colors of the Islamic State flag as they take up position after they retook the town of Sa'adiya, north-east of Baghdad . Assistant Attorney General Carlin said: 'More than 16,000 recruits from over 90 countries traveled to Syria to become foreign terrorist fighters with alarming consequences.' 'This is a global crisis and we will continue our efforts to prevent Americans from joining the fight and to hold accountable those who provide material support to foreign terrorist organizations,' he added. 'With these two defendants, we have now charged more than 15 individuals with offenses related to the foreign fighter threat in Syria.' FBI Director James Comey said this month his agency was tracking close to 150 Americans it believe had traveled to Syria. A federal official said authorities believe around a dozen Americans were fighting there with the Islamic State. Yusuf's parents — who authorities said didn't know about their son's plans — attended Tuesday's court hearing but declined to speak to The Associated Press. The Islamic State organisation emerged in spring 2013 from the warring groups in Syria's civil war. The jihadists proclaimed a 'caliphate' this June after seizing swathes of Iraq and Syria.","Abdullahi Yusuf, 18, was arrested as he tried to board a flight to Turkey .

"It has been a horrible season for Manchester United and not much better for record signing Juan Mata. The diminutive Spanish playmaker went from Champions League winner and back-to-back player of the year awards at Chelsea to losing his place in the team and being sold to a United side spiralling down the league. It is no surprise, then, that Mata has one eye on next season when he believes his new club, without the demands of European football to distract them, will be well placed to make an immediate return to the top of the pile. For both club and player, he believes, it will be a case of ‘what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger’. Spanish eyes: Juan Mata sees a way back to top for United . Trophy hunting: Juan Mata presents David de Gea with Manchester United's Players' Player of the Year award but next season wants the duo to get their hands on the Premier League trophy . Take it as Red: Mata scores against Norwich in Ryan Giggs' first match as United's caretaker manager . Hero worship: Mata (right) with Giggs, someone the Spaniard idolised growing up . On his knees: It has been a horrible season for Mata and his new club United . On the scoresheet: Mata has scored five goals since joining United . ‘I went through a situation at Chelsea . that I had not been through before in my career,’ he says. ‘I was not . playing regularly but I really believe that made me stronger. You can . lose faith in yourself in adversity but I never did. I remained . confident and I never lost sight of my objectives.’ He . believes United can emulate Liverpool who, unfettered by European . football, have lit up this season with their energetic football. ‘It . can definitely be an advantage in the league. Of course, I would rather . be playing in the Champions League, but if we take Liverpool as the . example — you have a team who have fought all the way to the finish . without having played in the Champions League.’ Mata . already has his own Champions League winner’s medal, having planted a . corner on Didier Drobga’s head for the Chelsea equaliser in that . dramatic final in Munich. What he can’t be sure about is who will lead . the club’s charge next season to get back into the competition. There . is an obvious bond with Ryan Giggs, whom he worshipped as a boy. The . old saying that you should never meet your idols clearly does not apply . in this case. ‘I told him when I arrived that he had been my hero . growing up. And he said to me, “I’m really happy you’re here. But I’m a . bit sad too because now I’ve only got the second best left foot at the . club.” ‘I told him that was . impossible. He was the player I watched most closely as a kid. I loved . the way he controlled the ball and the touch he had. He was a pure . winger, left-footed, right out on the touchline. He was fast, . unplayable in a one-on-one situation, and he scored goals. Now destiny . has made him my team-mate and my manager.’ Mata . knows Giggs’ reign might not last and is guarded about what the future . might hold. Asked about Louis van Gaal, he says: ‘I’ve never met him. I . know what kind of history he has, the titles he has won and the kind of . football he is playing with Holland. But I don’t think it’s good to talk . about a coach who is not our manager.’ If . the Dutchman does replace the Welshman, he will become Mata’s seventh . coach in three seasons. So much for English patience and trigger-happy . Spanish club presidents. ‘You mean it’s my fault,’ he laughs. Winning smile: Mata beams as he lifts the Europa League trophy in 2013 . Kings of Europe: Mata and Torres lift the Champions League trophy after a penalty shootout in 2012 . How . do the managers compare? ‘ (Andre) Villas-Boas was the person who brought me to . England and who trusted in me. He’s young, he has ambition and he wants . to play attractive, fun and winning football. I will always be grateful . to him. ‘Di Matteo was a . bit like Giggs. He was the ex-player, the assistant coach, who stayed . when Villas-Boas left. And he was a huge success. We won the Champions . League, the FA Cup ... he was fantastic with me and with the whole . group. He got us all together, all committed. ‘Then . we won the Europa League (with Rafa Benitez). It was hard for him at . first because of the history he had but I think he did things well. He . was professional and he won a title — a title that the club hadn’t won . before.’ Then came Jose . Mourinho. Why did it not work out? A lack of communication seems key, . although perhaps it was a symptom and not the cause of the problem. Did . he ask Mourinho why he was left out the side? ‘No. I didn’t consider it . opportune.’ Did Mourinho ever explain to Mata why he didn’t fit? ‘No. Nothing,’ he says. When the talking did begin it was between Chelsea and . United and it culminated in a helicopter flying him to Carrington on . January 25 this year. Season of woe: United have finished outside the top three for the first time in the Premier League era . Season to remember: Luis Suarez and Liverpool have had an excellent season domestically . ‘I . will always be grateful to Chelsea,’ he says. ‘To the directors, the . owner and the fans, because from the first day to the last they were . fantastic. No communication: Jose Mourinho did not explain to Mata why he was out of the side . ‘I wish them the . best, I really do. I have a lot of friends there. Cesar (Azpilicueta), . Fernando (Torres), David (Luiz), Oscar. I talk to Lampard and Terry a . lot too. I was with them for two and a half years and I wish them the . best.’ He is proud of the . open thank you letter he wrote Chelsea fans when he left. ‘I didn’t do . that just for the sake of my image, it was heartfelt. I wanted to . express what I felt about Chelsea, about the fans, who had always . treated me so well.’ Such a . public display of affection towards rival supporters might have . compromised Mata’s relationship with United fans but most see it as a . measure of the man. He is anxious to start wining trophies in a red . shirt and he says the critics should stop getting so hung up on which . position he plays. ‘Obviously, . I don’t consider myself an out-an-out right-winger as such, but it . offers me the chance to come inside on my left foot, and that way I have . a broader field of vision. I have also played on the left with Valencia . and with the national team and I liked it there. The position that I . have played best in is behind the striker. But I think I can play in the . other two as well.’ Mata won international youth honours for Spain with goalkeeper David de Gea and he believes United’s player of the year has the mentality to become an Old Trafford great. ‘He has huge . faith in himself, which is a really important virtue,’ Mata says. ‘He . doesn’t let anything affect him. He knows if he has made a mistake but . it never sinks him. He uses it to make sure that he doesn’t make the . same mistake next time. He’s very calm. Sign of the times: A Chelsea fan holds up a banner praising Mata following his departure to United . ‘I’ve . spoken to friends about this and they say about Leo Messi: “It’s as if . he doesn’t care about anything.” He scores goals and acts as if it’s . normal. But maybe that’s a good thing. There’s so much pressure and . maybe, if you tell yourself that you have to be brilliant all the time, . when you make a mistake you collapse. Maybe you have to treat it all a . bit more ‘normally’. I think that’s a quality great players have.’ So . can De Gea and Mata win together in the red of United as they have in . the red of Spain? ‘There has been a loss of confidence. Thirteen months . ago, you’d be losing 3-0 and you’d win 4-3 at Old Trafford,’ says Mata. ‘Now you’re losing 3-0 and it seems impossible. That mentality, that . confidence, has not always been there this season. But I think the . players and the club still have that attitude. The fans do, too. ‘I . remember, with Chelsea, it was almost impossible to win here. There are . huge demands at this club. If you don’t win the league one year, you . must win it the next year. Next season we have to demonstrate that the . club has not lost its essence; has not lost its mentality; has not lost . its competitiveness; and it has not lost its identity.’","Mata believes United can get back to the top with no European distraction .

"A spectacular new cable car that rotates to give visitors a panoramic views, has been unveiled at a Swiss mountain resport. The Titlis Rotair gondola rotates its way up towards the snow-covered summit of Mount Titlis from the popular resort town of Engelberg in the Canton of Obwalden in central Switzerland. The vehicle transports tourists from the middle station at Stand up to the top of the 9,926ft high mountain. The Titlis Rotair gondola rotates its way up towards the snow-covered summit of Mount Titlis from the popular resort town of Engelberg in the Canton of Obwalden in central Switzerland . The gondola revolves 360 degrees during the five-minute trip, treating visitors to idyllic panoramic views of steep rock faces, deep crevasses and distant snow-covered mountain peaks. It’s one of only three rotating cable cars in the world, the other two being the Palm Springs Aerial Tramway in California and The Table Mountain Cableway in Cape Town, South Africa. The idea for the rotating cable cars for winter and summer tourists at Engelberg was first floated as long ago as 1992, but was initially rejected by the department for transport as being too fanciful. But now, more than 22-years-later, it has finally been made into reality with the first cars heading up the slopes this week. The gondola revolves 360 degrees during the five-minute trip, treating visitors to idyllic panoramic views of steep rock faces, deep crevasses and distant snow-covered mountain peaks . The idea for the rotating cable cars for winter and summer tourists at Engelberg was first floated as long ago as 1992, but was initially rejected by the department for transport as being too fanciful . It allows people to experience different views as the cabin slowly rotates as it travels up the mountain. Tourist Martin Meyer, 45, said: ‘I always seem to get stuck in the pit of the cabin with worst view, but with the cabin slowly rotating sometimes you are looking down into the valley, and sometimes up to the mountain ahead. ‘And with the great panorama windows there is always something to look at wherever you are standing.

A cable car now running in the Dachstein mountain region in Styria, Austria has an open air viewing platform.Ten people can fit on the viewing platform where they can enjoy views that include several glaciers and more than a dozen peaks over 8,000ft . ‘It makes the journey to the top of the 3000 metre peak much more pleasant and interesting.’ ‘The pilot project involved installing temporary much smaller cabins where only the floor in the middle rotated, but was such a success that the new extra large circular cabins with wide panorama view windows have now taken their place. This time the whole cabin rotates once through 360 degrees as it goes up the mountain, turning on the axle where it is connected to the cable. The new project is just the latest in a number of innovative attempts to make cable cars more interesting as competition for visitors increases among Alpine regions.

"Police described victim Tai Lam, 67, as a ‘defenseless senior citizen’ with disabilities, who weighed less than 100 pounds and stood about 5 feet 5 inches tall . Police have released surveillance footage showing a group of men who they suspect of savagely beating a homeless man to death as he slept in an alley in downtown San Francisco. Tai Lam, 67, was found dead last Monday in an alley behind buildings near the corner of Montgomery and Sutter streets. He was still inside his sleeping bag. Police described Lam as a ‘defenseless senior citizen’ with disabilities, who weighed less than 100 pounds and stood about 5 feet 5 inches tall. He was not robbed, and there was no clear motive in the attack. Police spokesman Albie Esparza has described the incident as 'a vicious, unprovoked attack by these coward suspects.' Video surveillance shows a man kicking Lam’s sleeping bag. Police said the man and two others returned a short time later to beat him again. ‘There was no reason for this,’ said San Francisco Police Lt. Toney Chaplin. ‘As far as provocation goes, I don’t know how much provocation you can give someone sleeping in a sleeping bag with your crutches a few feet away from you.’ The attacks happened between 11pm and midnight on Nov. 23, but Lam's body wasn't discovered until about 7am the next morning. ‘He was unable to defend himself. He died alone after suffering these horrendous attacks,” Chaplin said. Scroll down for video .

"Louis van Gaal has claimed his Manchester United team is ready to tilt the balance of power back towards Old Trafford when they meet neighbours City in Sunday's derby at the Etihad Stadium. United know that victory against City on Sunday will move them to within a point of their stuttering neighbours and manager Van Gaal claims his team is good enough. Asked to compare the two squads on Friday, the United manager said: 'I am not jealous of the squad of Manchester City.

It is possible, we are growing, we are developing ourselves, I think. 'What we have seen of Manchester City in the last matches was not so good. But that was also the case last year, Ryan Giggs has warned me. So you never know.' With Wayne Rooney back for United on Sunday and City missing playmaker David Silva for a month after damaging knee ligaments in midweek, the visitors would appear to have a chance against a team who have not won for three games. Manchester United captain Rooney has been suspended since his red card against West Ham . The return of Rooney (left) to the line-up is likely to mean Mata (right) will be dropped to the bench against City . Manuel Pellegrini will be without midfielder David Silva, who was injured against Newcastle in midweek . City defender Pablo Zabaleta said: 'We need to do much better than we have done in the last three games. It is just about three points and winning that game. It means we can get the confidence back and it's something we need at the moment. We cannot drop points because of the race with Chelsea. It's a really important day for both teams.' City manager Manuel Pellegrini revealed that his club were never able to consider buying Angel di Maria from Real Madrid in the summer because of the spending restrictions placed on them by UEFA for breaking Financial Fair Play guidelines. Di Maria was offered to City the week before United paid £60million for him but Pellegrini said: 'We have an important restriction about budget this year. We cannot spend the money that United paid for Di Maria.' Van Gaal urged his players to take the emotion out of the game and avoid red cards.

Pablo Zabaleta (right), pictured with Angel di Maria and Rojo (left to right) at a Premier League Kicks charity event, says City cannot drop points against rivals United .

'That's also a main point in our preparation because you know that this is more than an emotional game,' said United's boss. 'We don't want a red card because when it is 11 versus 10 it shall be very difficult to win.' Meanwhile, Yaya Toure has surprised City fans by not choosing any of their summer recruits as among his five best buys of this season. One he did select has left the club — Alvaro Negredo — while another two have become United players. Toure said: 'I think definitely Di Maria and [James] Rodriguez. 'Rodriguez was a fantastic one, and, as well, United with the move for [Radamel] Falcao, he is a great striker, unbelievable.' Yaya Toure failed to name a single Manchester City signing when asked about last summer's best buys . Toure picked Real Madrid star James Rodriguez (right) as one of his top five summer signings . The Ivorian spoke highly of Negredo, who left for Valencia, adding: 'He's had injury problems, but he was brilliant for us last year and I think he's made a great move. We were sad to see him go because he was one of our top strikers last season. I think we are going to miss him a lot.' Toure gave a special mention for Liverpool's Mario Balotelli. 'The fifth one is one of my great friends, Mario Balotelli, like my brother. I hope he is going to do well with Liverpool because he has been involved in a few problems in the past year. But he is becoming more mature and he can control all of that.' Toure was speaking to Nissan.","Louis van Gaal is looking ahead to his first Manchester derby on Sunday .

"Hopes for much-needed moisture but fears of mudflows marked California as a Pacific storm headed toward the drought-dry state. Rain was expected to begin falling Tuesday, although the timing of the heaviest downpours was variable, according to the National Weather Service. Storm watches were posted for a large swath of the Sierra Nevada, where a huge amount of the state's water supply is normally stored as snowpack. Significant accumulations were predicted but not enough to be a drought buster. Weather warning: Denis Carruth collects sand bags to protect his home from possible flooding in Glendora, California, on Monday, December 1, 2014 . Any delight over the prospect of beneficial precipitation was tempered by concerns about the threat of debris flows from the many areas of California where wildfires have burned away vegetation that would keep soil stable. A weak storm Sunday was enough to block Pacific Coast Highway west of Malibu with a flow of mud from a section of the steep Santa Monica Mountains denuded by a 44-square-mile fire last year. The muck was cleared but debris basins that overflowed were still full and will keep the highway from reopening anytime soon. Flooding expected: California is bracing for the arrival of a new, more powerful Pacific storm following a weekend of scattered rain, showers and snow . Next round: More rain is expected to hit the drought-plagued southern California region on Tuesday, with 1-2 inches falling in the coastal and valley areas, and 2-5 inches in the foothills and mountains . 'We're going to have to wait until the next storm passes,' said Patrick Chandler of the California Department of Transportation. Residents placed sandbags to protect properties in foothill cities northeast of Los Angeles, where some communities below steep mountains have long lived with concrete barriers lining streets in hopes of keeping debris flows out of homes. Glendora resident Cory Hansen piled sand bags around his home. The pre-filled bags were stacked on pallets and offered to locals for free with a prove of address. 'Hundreds, hundreds of them,' he told KABC-TV. 'We don't know what's going to happen in the next few days.' Swirling motion: This NOAA satellite image taken Monday, December 1, 2014, at 01:00 AM EST shows a storm that continues to move slowly through the central Pacific . En route: The swirl of clouds  is moving eastward toward the coastal western U.S. Voluntary evacuations were also taking place in the city of Glendora with a temporary accommodation center being set up. Rainfall predictions include nearly two inches in Temecula and more than an inch in San Bernardino, Santa Ana, Long Beach, Malibu and downtown Los Angeles. Back-to-back storms are helping some cities in northwest California reach normal rainfall amounts for the year, or even better, but the reservoirs and Sierra snowpack that provide much of the state's water remain far short of what they should be, after three years of intense drought. Closed: A ten-mile stretch of the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, California was shut down on Sunday after rains caused a rockslide on the highly-trafficked road . Impassable: More than a dozen vehicles became stuck in the debris on the road, but no one was injured . The state Department of Water Resources reported the Sierra snowpack, which counts most for the state's water supply, was at 24 percent of normal for this time of year. Rain so far, at this early point in California's wet season, has yet to make much of an impact on the state's main reservoirs. Lake Shasta and Lake Oroville have less than 50per cent of their usual water level for the start of December, while Folsom Lake stands at 59per cent, said National Weather Service forecaster Eric Kurth. 'The good news is there's more storms on the way,' Kurth said.","Rain was expected to begin falling Tuesday .

"Doctors surgeries will be upgraded using a new £1 billion fund paid for by bank fines, George Osborne announced today. The Chancellor said the cash would pay for a 'permanent improvement in GP services' and comes on top of an extra £2 billion injection into the NHS budget set to be formally announced on Wednesday. The funding will allow patients  to undergo chemotherapy and dialysis closer to home. Scroll down for video . Chancellor George Osborne will announce an extra £3billion is to be spent on healthcare in Wednesday's Autumn statement . The announcement, ahead of Wednesday's Autumn Statement by the Chancellor, is designed to blunt Labour’s electoral advantage on the NHS. But Labour's shadow chancellor Ed Balls this morning promised to spend an extra £2.5billion on top of the Government's £3 billion cash injection. Speaking on the BBC’s Andrew Marr show this morning Mr Osborne insisted that increasing funding for the NHS was only possible because the economy was growing. He said: ‘Because we have a strong economy and we've got the public finances under control, we can afford to put £2 billion into the front-line of the NHS, across the UK.’ He added: ‘Indeed I can tell you we can go further and use those fines that have been paid by the banks for a permanent improvement in GP services. 'This is a down payment on the NHS's own long-term plan.’ The new money for GPs from bank fines amounts to £250 million a year for four years. The other £2 billion comes from £1.3 billion in new cash from the Treasury – with £700 million from Health Department ‘reallocated’ to the frontline NHS. Mr Osborne (right) speaks with nurse Carron Weekes (second left), accompanied by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt  (left) and NHS chief Simon Stevens , at the Homerton University Hospital in London today . The Chancellor visited a hospital this morning seeking to counter political attacks on his Conservative party's handling of the health service six months before an election . Mr Balls said a Conservative plan for £3 billion injection into the NHS was “crisis money”. He said: ‘The Conservatives wasted £3bn on their reorganisation of the NHS. So, this is a typical Tory pattern - a winter crisis and then crisis money coming after it. ‘The question is: is this a one off? Or is this going to be actual long-term investment in the nurses and doctors we need. ‘Labour has said we will have a tax on high value properties, £2.5bn over and above Tory spending plans for 20,000 more nurses, doctors, care workers too. We will save the NHS. As you can see the Tories are really putting the NHS in danger.’ No 10 is acutely conscious that despite Ed Miliband’s rock-bottom personal ratings, the NHS remains the only policy area in which Labour consistently polls ahead of the Conservatives. The expected announcement in Wednesday’s speech comes after days of behind-the-scenes jostling between the Tories and Liberal Democrats to claim credit for the NHS funding boost, with Liberal Democrat Health Minister Norman Lamb publicly calling for more resources to prevent a ‘crash’ in services over the winter. It had previously been rumoured that the NHS boost would amount to only £1 billion. The Autumn Statement is also expected to contain a number of big budget infrastructure announcements, with priority given to major new roads. Ministers are under orders from No 10 to be photographed next to the projects for use in ‘puff’ pieces for local papers. Mr Osborne (right) and Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls speak on the BBC's The Andrew Marr Show this morning . Mr Balls told Andrew Marr that Labour would spend £2.5billion more than the Tories over the next Parliament . Mr Osborne will claim in the statement – his last major pre-Election Commons setpiece other than March’s Budget – that his handling of the economy has enabled him to free up extra resources for the health service. ‘You can’t have a strong NHS without a strong economy to pay for it. If you don’t have a long-term plan for the economy, you don’t have a plan for the future of the NHS,’ he is expected to say, adding: ‘We have both. It’s because our economy is growing, and we’ve kept a tight control on the finances, that we can do more for the NHS.’ The Chancellor is also planning to make the political point that extra NHS funding should be allied to the more efficient management which he claims would be ensured by a Conservative administration. ‘This will support the day- to-day work of our incredible nurses, doctors and other NHS staff; but it is also a down- payment on the future of our health service. ‘This new money will be used to buy the new facilities and services that will help transform the NHS so it becomes more efficient for taxpayers and effective for patients.’ Mr Osborne will also claim credit for the fact that ‘the British economy is growing faster than any other major economy in the world’ – but will also repeat David Cameron’s warning earlier this month about the risks of a new global downturn hitting the UK economy. Labour fought back last night, with Chris Leslie, the party’s Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, saying: ‘This week George Osborne will have to admit that he has broken his promises. ‘He has failed to deliver rising living standards and that failure is why he’s also set to break his promise to balance the books by next year. ‘We need a plan to save and transform our health service too. Labour will raise an additional £2.5 billion a year, on top of Tory spending plans, for an extra 20,000 nurses and 8,000 GPs.’","GP surgeries to be upgraded using a new £1bn fund paid for by bank fines .

"The White House struggled on Tuesday to defend Colleen Bell, President Barack Obama's choice for U.S. ambassador to Hungary. Bell, a top Obama reelection campaign bundler and a producer of the soap opera The Bold And The Beautiful, was confirmed today without a single Republican vote in the last window of opportunity for Democrats to approve such 'patronage' appointments before the GOP takes over the Senate in January. Pressed to explain Bell's qualifications for the diplomatic position, the president's spokesman was unable to speak in specifics this afternoon, eventually citing her experience in the private sector as the reason she was selected. Producer Colleen Bell is pictured here in October attending the fifth annual PSLA Autumn Party, sponsored by Saks Fifth Avenue,  in Culver City, California. Bell, an Obama campaign donor, was named U.S. ambassador to Hungary today . Uhhh: White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest was unable to list a single real reason Bell is qualified to represent the country abroad during his daily press briefing at the White House this afternoon . The president is not technically allowed to use government jobs as rewards for his top donors, and when he was first elected, Obama promised to 'limit' his own abuse of the privilege. But like every modern president before him, Obama's frequently engaged in the practice anyway. By the American Foreign Service Association's count, 41 percent of current U.S. ambassadors were picked for their positions as a political courtesy while 58.6 percent were longtime diplomats. Touching on this today, ABC News' Jonathan Karl asked White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest, 'what are Colleen Bell's qualifications for ambassador?' 'Was it that she was a soap opera producer, is it that she gave hundreds of thousands of dollars - or helped raise hundreds of thousands of dollars - for the Obama reelection campaign? Why was she chosen?' he pondered. Earnest hemmed and hawed before describing Bell as 'somebody who retains the confidence that, well, let me say it this way: Ambassador Bell has the president's confidence that she will do an excellent job representing the U.S. and maintaining the important relationship the U.S. has with the government and the people of Hungary.' Not letting it go, Karl asked him 'where does the president get that confidence from?' 'I mean, in her confirmation hearing she couldn't even name a single strategic interest the U.S. had with Hungary,' he pointed out. 'Well, she certainly is somebody, again, that is, has had her own distinguished private sector career,' Earnest responded, to which Karl again pointed out that her only real business experience was work as a soap opera producer.' Trying again, the White House spokesman she is 'somebody who obviously has succeeded in the business world and she is somebody that the president has confidence will be able to maintain our relationship with the government and the people of Hungary.' Bell has worked on the Bold and the Beautiful off and on since 1991 in a variety of production positions. She left the show for a decade in 2000 and returned in 2012 as as an associate producer. The next year she was promoted to the producer spot. Today she was approved by the Senate 52-42 to serve as the next ambassador to the fellow North Atlantic Treaty Organization member state, despite the strong objections of Arizona Sen. John McCain. 'We're about to vote on a totally unqualified individual to be ambassador to a nation which is very important to our national security interest,' McCain said from the Senate floor. 'Her qualifications are as a producer of the television soap opera The Bold and The Beautiful, contributed 800,000 [dollars] to Obama in the last election and bundled more than $2.1 million for President Obama's re-election effort,' he continued. Political consultant Noah Bryson Mamet was also confirmed as a U.S. ambassador today despite admitting during a confirmation hearing earlier this year that he has never actually been to that country he will now serve as a representative to, Argentina . Arizona Sen. John McCain, pictured here talking to reporters this afternoon after party caucus luncheons at the U.S. Capitol, urged his colleagues today not to confirm Bell. 'Her qualifications are as a producer of the television soap opera The Bold and The Beautiful,' he said on the Senate floor . 'I am not against political appointees…I understand how the game is played,' he said, 'but here we are, a nation [Hungary] that is on the verge of ceding its sovereignty to a neo-fascist dictator getting in bed with Vladimir Putin and we're going to send the producer of The Bold and The Beautiful as the ambassador. Continuing, McCain asked his colleagues to 'put a stop to this foolishness' by voting no. McCain had grilled Bell during her confirmation hearing on what she would do differently from her predecessor to improve relations with the country. She was unable to articulate an answer before he moved on. Also approved by the Senate today was Noah Mamet, who will serve as the U.S. ambassador to Argentina. Senate Democrats gave him the job by a vote of 50-43, even though the Democratic fundraiser admitted during his confirmation hearing that he'd never even been to the South American country. Mamet raised at least half a million dollars for for Obama's reelection campaign in 2012, according to the Center for Public Integrity, and was on his national finance committee. After Mamet's confirmation proceedings earlier this year the American Foreign Service Association, a labor union for career diplomats, trolled both the political operative and Bell by putting out a list of basic skills that all ambassadors should have. 'Now, let’s be clear, someone who is a big donor, but who is also a person with a lot of international experience, that speaks foreign languages – that person can potentially qualify,' the group's president, Robert Silverman, told U.S. News at the time. 'It’s not a disqualifier in and of itself,' he added, 'but if that’s the only reason that person is being nominated for all we could tell, then that person should not be qualified.'","Colleen Bell, a Obama campaign bundler and a producer of the soap opera The Bold And The Beautiful, was confirmed to the post today .

"Gobbledygook: Russell Brand, has been recognised for his public speaking and writing - with an award . Russell Brand has finally been granted the recognition he deserves. Yesterday the comedian and self-styled revolutionary was honoured with an award – for speaking gobbledygook. He won the annual Foot in Mouth prize from the Plain English campiagn, joining the likes of John Prescott and George W Bush. Organisers said Brand – who has carved a career out of using many, often inflammatory, words when one would do – was ‘out on his own’ in the competition. They added: ‘While we admire Russell’s determination to open up a debate about democracy and the dire state of the world, we struggle to make sense of most of his comments.’ The group’s website said that Brand’s ‘seemingly endless stream of gibberish, both written and verbal’ had clinched the award. Brand, 39, who was sacked by MTV for going to work dressed as Osama Bin Laden the day after 9/11, later hosted Channel 4’s Big Brother’s Big Mouth and wrote memoirs My Booky Wook and Booky Wook 2. He is worth around £9million and lives in Shoreditch, East London. This week he backed a protest against rising rents in the city, but got angry with a reporter who asked him what his own home cost. He has taken to railing against the political system – despite admitting he does not vote – and has appeared on Newsnight and published a manifesto, Revolution. The Plain English judges singled out this rant from The Guardian: ‘I felt very connected to activism – particularly activism that feels loaded with potential. Not the oppositional activism that seems like there’s a stasis around it – earnestly sincere, but a monolith.’ Scroll down for video . Confrontation: The award came two days after Brand accused Channel 4 News journalist Paraic O’Brien of being a ‘snide’ as he was interviewed while helping to deliver a petition to 10 Downing Streeet . They also enjoyed this interview, from the Financial Times: ‘I find [capitalism] hard to understand. It obfuscates truth and I think an economic ideology is oppositional to the spiritual ideologies that are what we need to adopt if we’re to save our planet and humankind.’ The Plain English campaign, set up in 1979 to promote clear language, suggested that some of Brand’s ramblings might be ‘due to him being more worried about self-promotion than about making sense.’ London Mayor Boris Johnson was named Plain English Communicator for urging clarity in politics, and Golden Bull prizes for ‘written tripe’ went to Edinburgh Council, Buckinghamshire County Council, HMRC and BT. On the BBC: Over the last year, Brand has taken to railing against the political system - despite admitting he does not bother to vote - with two appearances on Newsnight (one pictured above, in October) Recipients: Brand joined John Prescott (left) and George W Bush (right) in winning the Foot in Mouth award .

"An Ebola-infected ISIS terrorist could easily motorboat across Lake Erie and reach Ohio from Canada, according to an American conservative filmmaker who videotaped a fictionalized one-jihadi incursion across Lake Erie and released the footage Monday. 'On the eve of the 9/11 anniversary our man, dressed as an ISIS terrorist was able to cross Lake Eris, walk off a boat into Cleveland, Ohio – and into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame,' guerrilla documentarian James O'Keefe narrates. 'At no point did anyone even question [him] or ask him what he was carrying in his suspicious brown duffel bag.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Video activist James O'Keefe shows in his latest film how ISIS terrorists could motorboat across lake Erie and land in Cleveland, Ohio without any challenge from US Border Patrol . In his footage, O'Keefe's play-acting 'terrorist' brings pretend poison across one of North America's Great Lakes with the intention of pouring it into Cleveland, Ohio's water supply . Clad in black from head to toe, O'Keefe's terrorist character managed to walk off his boat and into downtown Cleveland, and enter the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with a brown duffel bag – and was never challenged . O'Keefe's latest online provocation comes at a time when the world's attention is focused on the self-professed Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) and Americans are growing increasingly concerned about the danger the group could pose to the US. His video shows a black-clad jihadi with a British accent being ferried across Lake Erie, which separates Ohio from the Canadian province of Ontario. 'The British government says American journalist James Foley's ISIS assassin was an Englishman,' O'Keefe says in his narration. 'British intelligence believes more than 500 British citizens have joined ISIS. Brits can enter Canada without a visa; it's virtually an open door.' In the short gonzo documentary, O'Keefe meets up with a 'terrorist' who has hired a boat to bring him from Ontario to the middle of Lake Erie. The two exchange pleasantries as the pretend jihadi transfers to O'Keefe's American-piloted craft. 'On August 17 we stole Ebola from a lab in Liberia,' he says in the script. 'We took he bandages and the bedsheets and then we covered ourselves in it and hoped that we'd get infected. 'The incubation period is about 21 days, and it's been about – 21 days.' O'Keefe, a confirmed rabble-rousing video activist, last made national noise in August with a video showing how an Islamist terrorist – dressed as Osama bin Laden, no less – could wade across the Rio Grande River from Mexico to the U.S. without being detected. 'We went to Texas and saw little border security,' he told MailOnline on Monday; 'now we’ve discovered there’s even less border security on the Canadian border.' Charter caption Bob Swinney told O'Keefe that he has never seen US Border Patrol actually patrolling the lake known in Cleveland as 'America's North Coast' In the film, a dressed-up Islamist militant character points to the freshwater supply intake that he plans to use as a ricin delivery vehicle . His jihadi character in this latest video also carries with him a container marked 'ricin.' Playing the part to the hilt, the actor points to a fresh-water intake port that serves the Cleveland, Ohio metropolitan area, and tells O'Keefe, 'The water supply is over there. If we put it in there, it will kill a lot of Americans.' Staring into the camera, O'Keefe clarifies that the terrorist, his ricin and his Ebola-soaked linens are make-believe – but warns that 'anyone can cross this border. You could cross in a Jet-Ski if you wanted to.' 'You could import weapons, you could import whatever you wanted to, because there's no detection on our borders.' O'Keefe told MailOnline that 'the only coast guard vessels we saw were tied up at their docks.' 'One of the boat captains expressed his own concern about border security,' he said, 'and worried that perhaps the Great Lakes are the soft underbelly of America.' According to federal law, boaters who cross from Canada to the US must notify the Customs and Border Protection agency, but it's an open question whether they do -- or even know about the requirement . O'Keefe last made headlines by donning an Osama bin Laden Halloween mask and army fatigues to show how easy it would be for a terrorist to sneak into Texas by wading across the Rio Grande from Mexico .","Conservative filmmaker's latest provocation shows lax security on America's northern border .

"Crash: Laura Martin, 28, has apologized for hitting two little girls with her SUV, but promises she was not drunk . A mother has apologized from behind bars for hitting two little girls with her SUV, but is insisting she was not drunk.

"Stuart Kerner, pictured, is accused of having sex with the teenager in empty classrooms and cleaning cupboards all over their school . A pupil who has accused a married RE teacher of having sex with her is a self-confessed 'liar' who pretended she was in a car accident, a court today heard. Stuart Kerner, 44, is accused of having sex with the teenager in empty classrooms and cleaning cupboards all over their school during an 18 month affair. His alleged victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is a former student at Bexleyheath Academy in south east London. She was 15 when the affair is said to have begun. But today teachers at the school said the pupil was a 'proven liar'. Librarian Marion King told Inner London Crown Court: 'As she got older she got very cocky and thought everybody fancied her. 'She went around saying ""I can do what I like, I'm special"".' Mrs King told jurors the schoolgirl had pretended to be involved in a car accident to get out of PE classes. She turned up to school with a bandage around her chest in the elaborate charade, the court heard. Teachers eventually discovered from her mother that there had been no accident. Mrs King said: 'She said doctors found a problem with her heart. I said ""Oh my God are you OK?"" 'She said she couldn't do PE anymore. She had bandages all around her chest and said she had a tube put inside. She unwrapped her bandage and had a bloody line around three inches long.' Mrs King said she was moved to tears by the story, but later discovered it was a lie. She said: 'She came into my office and I said ""What is going on?"". 'She said: ""I lie - that's what I do"". 'She couldn't seem to grasp what she had done. It was shocking to me.' Mrs King said other pupils joked that the schoolgirl 'stalked' Kerner. She said: 'I thought Mr Kerner ought to be very wary of her. I think she had a crush on him and I said he needed to be careful because I think she has a massive crush on you. Teachers at Bexleyheath Academy (pictured) in south east London told the court the pupil was a 'liar' 'A couple of students commented on it. They said she is stalking him. I think she is very manipulative. She lied to me.' When she was contacted by police, Mrs King said she thought the allegations were 'rubbish' and branded the pupil a 'psychopathic liar'. She said: 'You have got a girl who is a proven liar saying unbelievable lies. 'I think she's a very sick girl. I think there is something wrong with her.' PE teacher Les Ainsworth said the schoolgirl showed 'no remorse' when she was caught out lying. He said: 'She was an attention seeker. Not only from her peers but from her teachers as well.' Religious studies teacher Stuart Kerner, pictured with his wife Katy, denies the charges against him . He added: 'When she came into the office I found her manipulative and quite tactile.' The PE teacher said he was told by two pupils in around May 2012 that the schoolgirl had told people she was having a relationship with Kerner. He chose to have a word with Kerner about the claims, but did not report it higher, jurors heard. Pressed on why he did not take the matter higher, he said: 'My decision at that time was to have a word with Stuart.' Kerner denies the allegations. The trial continues.

"Men who are obsessed with porn are to be given the chance to meet the stars of sex films to look at the realities of their lives for a Channel 4 documentary. Three men who are frequent users of pornography will be introduced to women who star in adult movies to see if they are able to distinguish between fantasy and real life. It is part of a new season of programmes for the station looking at the effect that porn is having on the nation and examining a more realistic view of British sex lives. Date My Porn Star will give porn obssessives the chance to date stars of adult movies to look at the realities of their lives. Pictured is a scene from the documentary . The programmes will also include documentaries about the effect on teenagers of being bombarded with sexual imagery and another which will help ordinary women to get more from their own sex lives. In one programme, Date My Porn Star, film-makers will take a trio of sex film fans to look into their views on the stars they meet, and also how the porn industry works. Channel 4 said it wanted to see 'if it is possible for them to relate to the stars as fully-formed people or whether their porn obsession has fundamentally altered their perception of the opposite sex'. In another programme in the Real Sex Season, called The Week the Women Came, a leading psychosexual therapist Trudy Hannington will try to improve sex lives for women who have struggled to orgasm or have lost their libido. Former Loaded editor Martin Daubney will front another film - Porn On The Teenage Brain - to look at how young people are consuming explicit material and what effect it will have on their lives and how they relate to people. Daubney famously resigned from the lads’ mag after an epiphany about the effect he felt that peddling soft porn was having on a generation. Former Loaded editor Martin Daubney (pictured) will front another film to look at how young people are consuming explicit material and what effect it will have on them .

Ralph Lee, head of factual at Channel 4 said: 'The aim of this season is to get a healthy perspective on sex. 'We live in world where pornography, fantasy and fetish are being considered the norm by many and we want to be very un-British and talk about what really goes on in Britain’s bedrooms.'","Show investigates if obsessives can distinguish between fantasy and real life .

"Sophie Lewis, 28, could be one of the first women in the UK to have a womb transplant . Five women who feared they would never give birth are in  line to receive the first womb transplants in Britain as early as next year. They have been selected by Richard Smith, a London consultant gynaecologist. He is now applying for the relevant ethical approval from the Government and hopes to begin the operations as soon as possible. This follows the news that the first woman in the world to have the transplant is now six weeks pregnant. Derya Sert, 22, who was born without a womb, received the organ from a fatal crash victim in a seven-hour procedure in southern Turkey in 2011. One of the five British women is 28-year-old Sophie Lewis, who was told at 16 that she could not deliver a baby naturally because she had no uterus. Miss Lewis, from Surbiton, Surrey,  suffers from MRKH syndrome – a condition affecting one in 5,000 women – which restricts womb development. 'I'm really, really excited about this,' she said. 'To be given this opportunity is such an amazing thing that I would go through everything and anything just to have the experience. 'If possible I would like three children but I'd be happy even with one. I'd be over the moon.' She said of the moment when her GP warned she would never be a mother: 'Everyone in school was getting periods and my mum was a bit concerned that I was not. I had a laparoscopy which confirmed I was born without a womb. 'At the age of 16, I don't think I really took it in. Obviously I wasn't at a stage of wanting children, so it didn't really affect me. As I have got a lot older, people around me are having children and the feeling is a lot stronger.' Miss Lewis, who works for a credit  ratings agency, has been with her 35-year-old partner Tilden Lamb for three years and they now feel ready to have a child together. She said they were reluctant to try to adopt 'as there is so much red tape'. And although they could have a  baby through surrogacy, they are worried that the surrogate mother might change her mind and want to keep the child. Sophie and partner Tilden Lamb had thought about surrogacy or adoption but were put off by the legal process . 'You are putting your trust in . somebody you possibly don't know for them to carry your child for nine . months and then they finally give birth to the child who they can . legally keep if they want to,' said Miss Lewis. The transplant operation would involve removing the healthy womb from a dead young woman who was a registered organ donor. It would be overseen by Mr Smith, from . Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea hospital and Imperial College. He said . the procedure would take four to five hours. 'There are 60 women who have actually approached us wanting a transplant and fall within our eligibility criteria.' All women wanting a transplant must first undergo IVF to prove their ovaries are capable of producing eggs to make an embryo. There would be no point them . undergoing the major operation only to find they were incapable of . producing a child. Miss Lewis and the other four transplant candidates . will be given immuno-suppressant drugs to stop the body rejecting the . new organ. This will make them more vulnerable to . infections but should not affect the development of the foetus. The . baby will have to be delivered by caesarean section as the new tissue . will not stand up to a natural labour. Doctors also suspect the women will be . at higher risk of complications, including miscarriage or premature . birth. Once the patient has had the desired number of children, the womb . will be removed and the drugs stopped to lessen the risk of infections.

"A cancer doctor treating five-year-old Ashya King admitted the only treatment available on the NHS would leave him with life-long disabilities, his parents revealed yesterday. Brett and Naghmeh King were told conventional radiotherapy would leave their son with ‘special needs’ which could be avoided if he received pioneering treatment abroad. Despite that admission, NHS doctors insisted they would go ahead with normal radiotherapy and threatened to have the horrified couple’s parental rights removed if they questioned the decision, the family said. Scroll down for video . Anguish: Brett (left) and Naghmeh King (centre) say a cancer doctor treating their five-year-old son Ashya (right) admitted to them that the only treatment available on the NHS would leave him with life-long disabilities . Speaking exclusively to the Daily Mail, Mr and Mrs King said they were forced to take their desperately ill son on the run across Europe to protect him from the devastating side effects of the NHS treatment. The family’s plight shocked the world when the couple were arrested for child cruelty and thrown in jail while Ashya was kept under armed guard, alone in a Spanish hospital. His brothers and sisters were banned from seeing him, and his parents said he was left ‘crying like a wounded animal through the night’ in his single bed ward. Now reunited, the family has secured his treatment in a private clinic and say the proton beam therapy – and their love – has already produced improvements in his health. Agony: Mr and Mrs King said they were forced to take their desperately ill son on the run across Europe to protect him from the devastating side effects of the NHS treatment . Father: Mr King, 51, (pictured with his son) said he asked about proton beam therapy as an alternative several times, but was told it offered no benefits over normal radiotherapy . In a moving and shocking interview serialised this week in the Mail, they tell how: . · Ashya’s initial operation to remove his brain tumour left him ‘like a vegetable with his eyes open’ · His parents had to hold his eyelids shut to allow him to sleep . · His suffering was so shocking his mother questioned if it was right to keep him alive . · Doctors said conventional radiotherapy would cause hearing and growth problems and leave him with special needs . · Medics said the NHS would not fund proton beam therapy despite it offering a better quality of life . · The couple was told the NHS only considered ‘survival’ in cancer funding decisions, not the potentially devastating side effects . Mr and Mrs King faced every parent’s nightmare when Ashya was diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumour after suffering a series of mystery symptoms. He was admitted to Southampton General Hospital for brain surgery and initially the couple were confident doctors were doing everything possible to save their son. Mrs King, 45, was arrested as she tried to get into an ambulance to accompany her five-year-old son to hospital . But the family’s own research into his condition led them to question the doctors’ insistence that he needed high doses of radiotherapy which would risk massive damage to healthy brain tissue. Mr King, 51, said he asked about proton beam therapy as an alternative several times, but was told it offered no benefits over normal radiotherapy. One doctor was said to have told him: ‘If you continue with these questions your rights to make decisions about Ashya will be taken away from you. ‘We will apply to the family court to have your parental rights removed and then we will give him any treatment we want.’ Mr King, a property developer from Southsea, Hampshire, said he then asked a radiologist at the hospital and was told cancer treatment decisions were taken on the basis of ‘survival rates’, not the patient’s quality of life afterwards. The radiologist told him: ‘If you’re asking me about quality of life, proton is superior. ‘With radiotherapy, your son will get secondary tumours, have hearing problems, growth problems and special needs for the rest of his life. ‘Children pay a heavy price for survival under normal radiotherapy.’ Faced with such a grim forecast for their child’s future, Mr and Mrs King said they felt they had no option but to take Ashya to Prague for treatment. When doctors discovered the boy was gone they contacted police, who issued a European arrest warrant for the couple. Two days later the parents were arrested in Spain as they prepared to sell their holiday home to fund Ashya’s treatment. Mrs King, 45, was arrested as she tried to get into an ambulance to accompany her five-year-old son to hospital and heard police questioning their instructions. Improvements: Now reunited, the family has secured his treatment in a private clinic and say the proton beam therapy – and their love – has already produced improvements in his health . One officer was overheard saying: ‘What sort of world do we live in where you take a sick child away from his mother?’ Mr and Mrs King were arrested and thrown into cells in one of Spain’s most notorious prisons for three nights, while Ashya was kept alone and isolated hundreds of miles away. The outcry over the family’s plight led to criticism that police and prosecutors had been too heavy-handed in issuing the European arrest warrant, which was eventually withdrawn. Public anger also prompted a nationwide fundraising effort as people rallied to help the family. Mr King described the emotional moment he was reunited with Ashya, saying: ‘I was hugging him. I could feel the pain inside him. Desperation: Mr King with his son in a video the family made explaining why they had taken Ashya from hospital . Treatment: Mr and Mrs King, seen leaving a police station in Malaga for an extradition court hearing, were arrested and thrown into cells in one of Spain’s most notorious prisons for three nights . ‘I said, “Ashya I’m here now. I’m never going to leave you. I’m so sorry for what happened but we’re here. We’re going to be together forever. You don’t have to cry any more.’ Ashya has now begun treatment and the NHS has agreed to pay for his proton beam therapy in the Czech Republic, meaning public donations can be used to help other children. Doctors in Prague say his type of brain tumour has a 70 to 80 per cent survival rate and hope he will make a full recovery. While delighted by his progress, his parents said their enforced separation had ‘scarred’ the five-year-old, who now howls in protest if either of them steps away from his bedside. Reunited: Asyha is accompanied by his parents as he arrives at the Motol Hospital in Prague . Treatment: Ashya has now begun treatment and the NHS has agreed to pay for his proton beam therapy in the Czech Republic, meaning public donations can be used to help other children . Southampton General Hospital has denied that its doctors ever threatened to seek a court order to remove the Kings’ rights to make decisions about Ashya’s care. It has defended its decision to recommend standard radiotherapy and chemotherapy and said its treatment plan for Ashya complied with NHS best practice guidelines for cancer care. Despite repeated efforts, nobody at Southampton General Hospital was available for comment last night.","Parents told conventional radiotheraphy would leave son with 'special needs'

"Richard Horne rolled back the years with a man-of-the-match performance for Hull as they toppled Super League leaders St Helens to gain their first win in seven matches. The 32-year-old half-back looks set to end his 16-year career with the Black and Whites at the end of the season after being told he will not get a new contract but he showed he still has plenty to offer as he masterminded an impressive 19-12 win for his side at the KC Stadium. Horne, who returned to the side in place of the injured Jordan Rankin, scored their first try and was influential throughout as lowly Hull maintained their recent improvement by claiming a notable scalp. Rolling back the years: Richard Horne inspired Hull to an unlikely win against the Super League leaders . St Helens skipper Paul Wellens scored his 1,000th point for his club as they battled throughout with a makeshift half-back pair but they can have no complaints over the outcome. Saints, whose only other defeat in their last seven matches was at neighbouring Hull KR, stay top of the table courtesy of Leeds’ surprise home defeat by Bradford and they also lift the Steve Prescott Cup in memory of the former England full-back who played with distinction for both clubs after topping the aggregate score in the two games this season. Saints were the liveliest team in a nervous opening quarter for both teams and took the lead when right winger Tom Makinson scooped up a wayward pass and wrong-footed the Hull defence to score his 22nd try of the season. Mark Percival added the conversion to make it 6-0 but Hull gradually clawed their way back into the contest, largely through the efforts of Horne. The former Great Britain half-back twisted and turned out of a series of attempted tackles to register his side’s first try on 17 minutes and Joe Westerman levelled the scores. Battle: Hull's Jordan Abdull and Aaron Heremaia get to grips with Jordan Turner at the KC Stadium . That gave the home side just the confidence they needed, while the introduction of heavyweight forward Iafeta Paleaaesina lifted the crowd as he tore into the Saints defence. A clean break by full-back Jamie Shaul came to nothing but Hull maintained the pressure and it paid off six minutes before the break when right winger Tom Lineham forced his way over from dummy half close to the line and Westerman’s second goal made it 12-6. The half-time hooter came at a good time for St Helens, who were a rejuventated side at the start of the second half largely through the efforts of hooker James Roby. Makinson demonstrated his ever-present threat with a 50-metre break out of defence and, although Shaul pulled off a crucial tackle, Hull’s defence was exposed out wide when loose forward Willie Manu slipped out a superb pass to get skipper Wellens over for his side’s second try, which enabled him to reach 1,000 points for the club. Percival’s second conversion tied the scores but that served to inject fresh enthusiasm into the home ranks. Westerman missed a chance to reclaim the lead for Hull when he put a penalty attempt wide of the target but another probing run from Horne created the position from which prop Mickey Paea proved unstoppable from 10 metres out as he claimed his third try of the season. Westerman was again off target with the goal attempt but Hull forced their visitors into a series of handling errors to keep them pinned inside their own half and Westerman clinched the win with a penalty and a drop goal.","Half-back will retire at end of this season but scored the first try in this win .

"A close mate of murder victim Jill Meagher has unloaded on the Australian justice system and recalled the horror of losing her 'beautiful friend' in a written tribute nearly eight hundred days after her death. In a White Ribbon blog post, Aoife Lyons, 32, who moved to Melbourne from Dublin to be with her friend, has told of the surreal time that followed Meagher's disappearance in September 2012. An ABC employee, Meagher, 29, was raped and murdered while walking home from a bar in Brunswick, Melbourne. The attack shocked the Australian community, provoking thousands of Melbourne residents to take to the streets to 'Reclaim the Night'. Scroll down for video . Best of friends: Aoife Lyons, left, moved to Melbourne from Dublin to be with her mate, Jill Meagher, right, who vanished from Sydney Road, Brunswick on September 21, 2012 . 'Beautiful friend': ABC employee Jill Meagher's disappearance and death sparked a huge emotional outpouring from the Australian community . Good memories: In her tribute post, Ms Lyons, front, recalled the years the two spent together - 'some hazy and beer-soaked', others 'of laughing at the absurd clicking of her high-heels, worn down to the nail; of her innumerable tales of ludicrous antics... and so much more' 'Her picture was everywhere,' Lyons wrote. 'The story played out on TV like any other story of that sort, but profoundly different, at once distant and intensely personal.' 'It was a waking nightmare; I would drink myself to sleep every night, descend into an eight hour blackness, to emerge tired, confused, and almost manic in search of distractions. 'The anger came later. When someone you love has been designated a ‘victim’ in such horrific circumstances, it is just one aspect of the surreal smorgasbord that is to follow. 'There’s an intense numbness, interspersed with boundless panic and disbelief. Then the anger. I thought I knew what it was to be angry, but I had never even touched its surface.' But it was the judicial and parole systems that allowed Meagher's attacker to walk free prior to the assault that prompted powerful criticism from Lyons. Huge wave of support: Demonstrators took to the streets to mark the first anniversary of Meagher's murder . Forensic police inspect the site where Ms Meagher's body was found . 'It would be comic if it weren't so tragic. 'All that stands between women and violent, recidivist sexual offenders is a paper tiger, a check-the-box 'rehabilitation' and a judicial system and parole structure that is as effective as using a croissant as a toothbrush. 'It doesn't get the job done, and it makes a f***ing mess'. She added 'the only shred of hope for me is that something positive can be wrenched out of this madness', whether that be considered changes to the parole system or 'something worthy of Jill, something creative and joyous' that could be 'eked out from this mess'. Ms Lyons, who spoke at Meagher's funeral along with her husband, Tom, said books, movies and songs often provoked memories of Jill, who she remembered as brassy, self-deprecating, shameless and adventurous. She said the past two years had been a struggle and, 'until quite recently I drank as though I were trying to drown myself, and I was. It is a private, isolating hell'. 'I hope I will eventually be able to remember the remarkable influence her life had on me, without the poisonous recollections of anger and trauma - these are totally out of step with what Jill was for me, and I resent their imposition'.

Over here you'll have to wait for the spring for this sleek mini-estate as UK order books open in January for March deliveries. Scroll down for video . Expect prices from around £25,500 to about £43,000 for the pumped-up CLA45 AMG . Expect prices from around £25,500 to about £43,000 for the pumped-up CLA45 AMG, which will accelerate from rest to 62mph in 4.7 seconds, thanks to its 360 bhp, 2-litre turbo engine — the world's most powerful four-cylinder engine in series production. Mondeo Man is having the last laugh as the latest incarnation of Ford's family car will depreciate less than a BMW, Audi or Volkswagen, say independent motor trade experts at CAP Automotive. According to its Gold Book, a diesel Mondeo 2.0 TDCi ECOnetic Zetec will hold onto 42.7 per cent of its new list price after three years and 30,000 miles. That compares with 38.3 per cent for a diesel Audi A4 2.0 TDIe SE, 36.8 per cent for a BMW 3 Series 318d SE and 41.6 per cent for a VW Passat 2.0 TDI Bluemotion Tech Executive. And at three years, with 60,000 miles on the clock, a petrol Mondeo 1.5 EcoBoost Zetec will be worth 36.1 per cent of its list price, beating an Audi A4 1.8T FSI 170 SE, a BMW 320i SE's and a VW Passat 1.4 TSI 160 Executive. The book also expects the new Mondeo to be worth £1,750 more after three years than the previous model was at the same age. There's a fascinating, if jawdropping and wince-making, TV series at the moment looking at the culture, attitudes and language used on TV in the Seventies. Did they really say and wear things like that? They surely did. I was reminded of this when BMW boss Tim Abbott, president of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), spoke at its annual dinner this week. Explaining how production is now on track for levels not seen since the Seventies, he said: 'Production is — despite the uncertainties — still forecast to rise to around two million by 2017, last achieved in 1972. But it needs a strong European market.' He noted: 'For those of you who, like me, can remember 1972, the transformation of our industry — in products, technology, labour relations and management — has been remarkable. 'In 1972, children used to rattle around in the back of cars like nuts in a can. You couldn't see where you were going because of all the cigarette smoke and your flared trousers would be caught on the brake pedal.' Quite. Remember that infectiously catchy — if slightly irritating — Korean song that dominated the charts a few years back? Gangnam Style, by PSY, took its name from the trendy, upmarket Gangnam district of South Korea's capital, Seoul — its version of Kensington and Chelsea in West London. Gangnam is also the place where car-maker SsangYong — Korean for 'two dragons' — has its headquarters. And in the New Year it's hoping to emulate PSY's success with the launch of a new sports utility vehicle. The five-door Tivoli is pitched to take on the quirky Nissan Juke. It will be launched in Korea in January before a European debut at the Geneva motor show and will arrive here next summer. Expect prices from around £13,500 and the option of either a 1.6 litre petrol or a 1.6 litre diesel engine. As well as offering lots of interior seating and storage space, it aims to offer driver and passengers easy IT connectivity. SssangYong's UK sales and marketing director Steve Gray expects it to double the firm's annual UK sales from 2,000 to 4,000 a year. There's also a five-year unlimited mileage warranty.

Millions of parents could be risking their child's safety because of confusion over car seats, says new research. Seventy-four per cent of parents with children under four said they use a front-facing seat. But this puts them at up to five times greater risk of death or serious injury than if they were seated facing the rear of the car, says a report for Volvo Car UK. It says: 'In the UK, official guidance is to keep children in a rear-facing seat until they are 13kg (around nine months). However, in Sweden the norm is to postpone the change until up to age four. 'In Sweden, not a single child under six died in a car in 2013 and there were just ten serious injuries among child passengers under six.

"Putting the kitchen knives away and out of reach of our 11-year-old son for fear he would deliberately hurt himself has been, without doubt, our lowest point as parents. But we had no choice. Two months after starting ‘big school’ last year our lovely boy, Jack, our previously care-free fourth child, had made an attempt to cut his arm with a large chopping knife. Jack had skipped off to secondary school full of excitement. When your child breaks a leg it’s a blue light into A&E. But when you arrive at a GP surgery to seek help on mental problems, the first response was to tell our child to pull himself together (file picture) But within weeks he had descended into a mental health freefall — consumed with worry about being late to school and struggling with his homework, he became severely withdrawn and paranoid. He wasn’t sleeping, and his anxiety was making him physically unwell. My husband and I were not remotely prepared for it. Three months after he tried to cut himself — and by now nearly halfway through his school year — Jack was diagnosed with generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), which means you feel anxious about almost everything. Sufferers also start catastrophising, imagining the worst possible outcome for everything that is bothering them. Indeed for Jack, every problem would morph into something far bigger. Our son is now well on his way to a complete recovery, thanks to cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). But accessing the specialist help he needed was unbelievably difficult, and if I hadn’t kept battling his corner, there is no doubt in my mind that by now he would be in hospital. When your child breaks a leg it’s a blue light into A&E. When their asthma gets worse, the doctor will write you a new inhaler prescription. But when you arrive at a GP surgery to seek help on mental problems, the first response — at least in our case — was to tell our child to pull himself together. So a crushing report published last month by the Commons Health Select Committee made painfully familiar reading. It is estimated that one in ten children aged five to 16 suffers from a diagnosable mental health disorder — including GAD —which equates to three children per class. That’s 290,000 children in Britain. The report concluded there were ‘serious and deeply ingrained problems’ with mental health services for these young people. You’re telling me. At first, I approached the school, two weeks into Jack’s first term. Doctors often feel woefully unprepared when faced with children in mental health crisis, according to the report from the Commons Health Select Committee . I explained he seemed disproportionately stressed. But responses from staff were feeble: ‘Don’t worry, it’s Year Seven, they all feel a bit like this’ and ‘We have children here with real problems, just give him time, he’ll settle’. Although Jack was able to keep it together at school, every day he would come home crying and all the problems would tumble out. ‘I don’t like that school, I don’t like my tutor, I’ve no one to sit with at break,’ the list was endless. As the weeks went by, he started having trouble sleeping. He would regularly still be awake into the early hours, crying and screaming that he hated life. He began to sleepwalk and lost weight. It was a frightening time for all of us. I felt wretched. Every waking minute of every day my thoughts were centred on Jack. After two months, I took him to see the GP. I couldn’t get an appointment with my usual doctor, so we saw another GP in the practice. She didn’t know our family at all, and had no way of gauging if this behaviour was usual for us. Indeed, doctors often feel woefully unprepared when faced with children in mental health crisis, according to the new report. In a poignant comment, GP Jane Roberts, who is the Royal College of General Practitioners’ clinical champion for youth mental health issues, told the Commons Health Select Committee: ‘In a ten-minute consultation it can feel overwhelming to open a Pandora’s box and begin to look at what is troubling a young person . . . especially if the options for referral are limited and difficult to access.’ The report’s authors want GPs to receive better training in young people’s mental health, saying everyone has a right to see a professional with sufficient knowledge. Maureen Baker, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, says it has been campaigning to include mandatory placements in mental health care in GP training. The GP we saw initially advised us to give Jack a few more weeks to see if school became more familiar. But a week later Jack came home with his older brother, who announced he couldn’t cope any more with his sibling’s increasingly erratic behaviour to and from school. He said Jack was constantly checking his bag, checking the time and, on occasions, would try to go back to school at the end of the day to check his homework with the teachers. It's estimated 290,000 children aged five to 16 suffers from a diagnosable mental health disorder . It was as he was telling me this that Jack took a large kitchen knife to his arm. It was a half-hearted attempt and thankfully he didn’t actually pierce the skin. My ‘lioness protecting her cubs’ instinct kicked in. Through his tears — and mine — I calmly told him to put down the knife and hugged him, saying whatever I could think of to comfort him. You will do anything to protect your child, but I knew I was woefully out of my depth. As much as I was saying we would help him, I knew ‘the system’ was failing us. That same day, I went to the GP surgery and asked for an appointment then and there. But it was the end of surgery hours and it was only when I quietly refused to leave they agreed to see us. We saw yet another GP, who leaned forward and told Jack all about the patients she had seen that day, who were perhaps more in need of help than him. I told her calmly that our son had dallied with knives and told his brother he wanted to die. The GP — barely out of med-school — stayed completely expressionless, not so much as a raised eyebrow. I asked for a referral to child and adolescent mental health services and at first she suggested we wait and see and come back in the New Year — some four weeks later — if need be. With tears of frustration now rolling down my cheeks, I again indicated my willingness to camp in the surgery until the referral letter was written. She begrudgingly agreed, though our son still wasn’t seen — even as an emergency referral — until January. The psychiatrist we saw was sympathetic but made a shocking suggestion. If we could afford it we should pay privately for CBT — Jack could wait to get it on the NHS, but that could take as long as three months. She could see he needed help urgently, but said there was nothing she could do. Chris Leaman, policy manager at the charity YoungMinds, is not surprised by our story. He says last year 77 per cent of clinical commissioning groups, (the bodies responsible in NHS England for commissioning, planning, agreeing and monitoring health services) had their budgets cut or frozen for such services. In emergency cases, children can end up in police cells as there are no NHS beds available. We are lucky. We have private medical insurance. But still it was a battle — at every stage I had to keep chasing, and it wasn’t until March we had our first appointment with the psychologist who would finally help our son. Jack found it hard — CBT works on changing your thought processes, which is not easy — but he is now well on the road to recovery. He found it difficult returning to school this September but his psychologist helped him with strategies so he could cope. We’ve been warned by Jack’s therapist that he may always be someone who doesn’t react well to big change. But how wrong it is that the help he badly needed was not there for him. Please, health provider decision makers, wake up and make child and adolescent mental health issues a bigger priority. Just last week it was revealed seven mental health patients have killed themselves since 2012 while waiting for a bed on a specialist ward. What more will it take before mental healthcare is taken seriously? It has to be, for all our sakes — but most of all for those young people who need it.

"Potholes on the roads could be a thing of the past if a futuristic plan to produce self-healing concrete comes to fruition. The concrete would produce bacteria to fill the cracks when the concrete gets damaged. It is one of the innovative schemes outlined in a report on the future of highways by engineering company Arup. The 'self-healing' concrete would produce bacteria to fill in the cracks when the highway gets damaged (file picture) The report looks at possible trends up to 2050 and also envisages the replacement of conventional road surfaces with solar panels that could charge electric vehicles and melt snow. Temperature-sensitive paint on the roads could generate giant snowflake-shaped warnings to indicate a drop in temperature and icy conditions. Arup predicts that patterns of ownership will change in the coming years, with commuters more likely to purchase access to a vehicle rather than the vehicle itself. The numbers cycling and walking are likely to increase and electric cars could become commonplace, with developments in science dramatically improving performance. Fully automated navigation systems could enable roads to be populated by driverless cars which could change the design and operation of highways, and provide safety and environmental benefits. The report also suggests that improved communications will make cars more 'intelligent' and 'self-aware' of traffic levels, speed, weather and potential safety hazards. Arup's global highways business leader Tony Marshall said: 'While temperature-sensitive paint and solar surfaces may seem far-fetched, the innovations envisioned in this report are already being tested and piloted around the world. 'They will change the way that we approach mobility and freight transport and will provide safer, more reliable and more environmentally friendly highway infrastructure for generations to come.'

"Every morning Sportsmail brings you the biggest gossip and headlines on the continent, giving you your early morning fix from the biggest leagues across Europe. The main focus on the continent on Thursday is on the return of the Champions League and how each nation's teams performed in the opening round of fixtures in Europe's elite competition. First up, Spanish newspaper AS has made an effort to quash the perceived opinion that £60million Real Madrid signing James Rodriguez is somehow lazier than his equally-expensive but departed counterpart Angel di Maria. James Rodriguez covered more ground than all Real Madrid players bar Toni Kroos in the 5-1 win over Basle . The paper's front page headline is 'James works it out' due to the fact that only Toni Kroos (11.4km) covered more ground than the Colombian (11.3km) in the Real side during their 5-1 victory over Basle. James also scored in the win. Marca, meanwhile, leads on 'The 1,000 days that changed Atleti and Spanish football'. This refers to Diego Simeone's 1,000th day in charge of Atletico Madrid and how he has completely changed the face of La Liga. The paper says Simeone has broken the 'duopoly' of Madrid and Barcelona by claiming five trophies in seven finals to return Atleti back to the Spanish elite. Marca celebrates Diego Simeone's 1,000th day in charge of Atletico by saying he 'changed Spanish football' Mundo Deportivo and Sport focus on Barca's laboured 1-0 victory over APOEL Nicosia at the Nou Camp. 'Decisive' is the headline in Mundo as Gerard Pique's goal gave the Catalans top spot in their Champions League group ahead of Paris Saint-Germain and Ajax. Gerard Pique's winner for Barcelona against APOEL Nicosia is described as 'decisive' by Mundo Deportivo .

"Thousands of EU migrants who are still on the dole after a lengthy stay in Britain could have their benefits taken away under a crackdown to be unveiled today. Up to 4,000 Europeans living here for a year or more will be assessed on whether they have the genuine prospect of finding work. Those who fail will lose their right to Jobseeker’s Allowance. The measures are in addition to David Cameron’s detailed plans to ban EU migrants from claiming benefits including lucrative tax credits until they have worked in this country for four years. Migrant workers gather outside the Honeypot pub in north-west London looking for cash-in-hand work this week. Selco and the neighbouring B&Q have employed a dog handler to keep them away from customers . Yesterday, the Prime Minister’s prospects of securing agreement for the package of changes were given a boost by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who said the proposals needed to be discussed ‘in detail’. Her comments were seen as an indication she will not try to block the main thrust of Mr Cameron’s proposal. Mrs Merkel told a press conference she was ‘pleased’ that Mr Cameron had not attempted to undermine the principle of free movement. ‘We are pleased that this was not put into question by the British prime minister,’ she said. ‘The proposals that were presented now need to be discussed in detail,’ she added, saying that Germany and the European Commission would have a close look at Cameron’s propositions. Ministers are understood to be due to announce the new crackdown on long-term unemployed migrants today. File picture . However, the Polish government made clear it would veto the proposals unless they are watered down. Many of the beneficiaries of Britain’s generous benefits system are Polish. This week it emerged that Britain now has almost as many Poles as live in Krakow. The country’s Europe Minister Rafal Trzaskowski said protecting the EU’s principle of free movement was an ‘absolute red line’ for Poland in any negotiation on a new deal for Britain. Ministers are understood to be due to announce the new crackdown on long-term unemployed migrants today. They believe it can be implemented without EU approval, as it falls within existing law. Living rough: refugees in Calais . A new hostel for migrants hoping to cross the Channel into Britain is to be opened in Calais. The ‘cold weather emergency centre’ will be used once temperatures fall below -5C (23F) in the French port – and could be ready to open within days. Located in a 40,000 sq ft warehouse, it is fitted with beds and hot showers and will be able to house 1,500 of the estimated 2,000 refugees currently living rough in the area. It will be the first large-scale shelter for Calais migrants since the controversial Sangatte Red Cross hostel was bulldozed in 2002. Sangatte was used as a stepping stone to Britain by an estimated 18,000 refugees during its six years of operation. Local government official Denis Robin said the new centre, two miles from the ferry port, would be available for use within the ‘coming days’. He added: ‘The cold weather plan will provide shelter for all those people left outside when temperatures fall. ‘We need a space that can house around 1,500 people, that they can reach on foot, but one that is not in the town centre, because encouraging migrants to remain in the town centre is a sensitive issue in Calais.’ The town is also opening a separate day centre to offer hot food and showers to the most vulnerable migrants, such as women with children and the elderly. The British government has argued that providing beds and showers for migrants will only encourage more to travel to Calais – hoping to stow away aboard ferries to Dover. But Mr Robin insisted the new shelters were ‘humanitarian gestures’, adding: ‘Neither of these centres are in any way new Sangatte-type hostels.’ Tensions have been mounting in the French town due to the influx of migrants fleeing war in the Middle East. Mass brawls between rival gangs left more than 70 people injured during July and August. In October, Home Secretary Theresa May promised to give France £12million to tighten security in Calais, after 250 migrants stormed the ferry terminal trying to reach Britain. Calais mayor Natacha Bouchart recently blamed the UK’s ‘generous’ benefits system for the problems. From January this year EU migrants were given a maximum of six months of JSA claims during which they could look for work. In July, Mr Cameron announced this would be cut to three months. But the rules were not retrospective, meaning some 4,000 EU migrants who have been here since before January do not fall under the six months maximum. Whitehall sources said anyone claiming before the new rules came into force will have their JSA withdrawn unless they have ‘very clear job prospects’. A single market town in the foothills of the Pennines has taken more asylum seekers than all of South East England. New figures show Rochdale houses 680 – one in 41 of all those in Britain. Yet the entire South East region, among the UK’s most affluent, has received just 441. Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk said his seat had become a ‘magnet for the dispossessed’. A genuine prospect of work test, applied to their benefit claims, will attempt to work out whether or not they are likely to get a job in the near future. Currently, Jobseeker’s Allowance is paid out at £72.40 a week for over 25s and £57.35 a week for under 25s. Meanwhile, Eurosceptic Tory MPs will attempt to embarrass Mr Cameron today with a new demand to seize back powers from Europe over borders and immigration. Twelve backbenchers have signed up to a proposal that would hand Parliament an override on all diktats from Brussels – and allow Britain to overrule rulings from European judges. The Bill would provide for an effective veto of any law coming out of the European Union with a majority vote in both Houses of Parliament. Bill Cash, the chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee, will publish the UK Parliament (Sovereignty and Jurisdiction over Borders) Bill in Parliament today. The timing will annoy the party leadership, who are focused on Chancellor George Osborne’s crunch Autumn Statement. The Bill will not be debated in the House of Commons but could distract from the focus on the economy. Mr Cash said: ‘This is absolutely essential, it is needed, it is in the national interest.’ ‘The voters’ right to govern themselves through Parliament has served us over the past generations and it is now absolutely essential to reassert that. ‘We either accept what the EU is doing or we take a stand.’","Cameron also wants to ban EU migrants from benefits for four years .

"While the Duchess of Cambridge oozed glamour as she gave a ceremonial welcome to the president of Singapore, many could be forgiven for thinking the rest of her family might have been enjoying the benefits of her royal lifestyle. But as Kate, who is around 13 weeks pregnant with her second child with Prince William, rubbed shoulders with fellow royalty  in London, her parents and sister were mingling with  the public at a remote airport hundreds of miles away. Carole, Michael and Pippa Middleton proved they are not too posh to fly economy class as they boarded an easyJet flight from the Scottish Highlands to London Gatwick yesterday. Scroll down for videos . Pippa Middleton, 31, and her parents Carole and Michael (pictured) were spotted boarding an easyJet flight at Inverness Airport in Scotland while the Duchess of Cambridge greeted the Singapore president in west London . Pippa and her mother Carole (circled) could be seen boarding the flight which was destined for London Gatwick. Despite opting to take the budget airliner, the family chose to pay £12 each for priority boarding . However, while the trio -  spotted arriving with hand luggage at Inverness Airport - may have opted for the cheap travel option, they did at least fork out up to £12 each for priority boarding. With tickets available for as little as £54 for the 600-mile journey, Pippa, 31, and her parents shocked onlookers as they waited in the terminal before boarding the budget flight. One passenger on the plane, who asked not to be named, said: 'We saw them wandering around the terminal. 'Inverness is a tiny airport, and there was only one plane on the runway, otherwise I might have thought they were flying in a private jet. They're rich enough, I suppose. 'I think they had paid to select their seats, which meant they got to board the plane first, and were all sat in a row when I finally made it on the plane. 'They're practically royalty, but it's nice to know that they're not too posh to fly with normal people.' Onlookers said the Middletons mingled in the terminal before boarding the flight from the Scottish Highlands . It is not the first time Pippa Middleton, 31, (right) and her parents Carole (left) and Michael (right) have chosen to fly with the budget airline. The family (pictured at Wimbledon) flew to Italy on an easyJet plane last September . While the rest of her immediate family were boarding a budget airliner in Scotland, the Duchess of Cambridge attended a ceremonial welcome for the Singapore president in west London with her husband Prince William . The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge greeted the president of Singapore Tony Tan Keng Yam and his wife Mary at the Royal Garden Hotel in Kensington, west London, on the first of a four day state visit to the United Kingdom . After the 80-minute flight, the Middletons got off with their hand luggage and disappeared through the airport. Their journey came while Kate, 32, entertained Singapore president Tony Tan Keng Yam and his wife Mary on their official tour to Britain. The Duchess was joined by her husband Prince William as she greeted the president on behalf of the Queen at the Royal Garden Hotel in Kensington, west London. Following the state visit, the Duchess - who until yesterday had not been seen in public for more than seven weeks after suffering severe morning sickness - attended a glamorous black tie event at London’s Natural History Museum. The royal took some time for herself at Kensington Palace between the two official engagements before stepping out in the evening to present awards to the winners of the Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition at the museum. The Duchess and Sir David Attenborough both attended the awards ceremony in London in what was Kate's first day of public appearances since Kensington Palace announced she was expecting her second child . The Duchess with Sir David Attenborough and Young Wildlife Photographer of the Year Carlos Perez Naval . The Middletons' outing on the easyJet flight is not the first time they have flown with a budget airline. In September last year, Pippa flew to Bari airport in Italy, with her parents and brother-in-law, Prince Harry, with the same airline. However, she is more accustomed to luxurious trips abroad and has been spotted in the past jetting off to the likes of the private Caribbean island of Mustique, Verbier in Switzerland, the Austrian ski resort of Lech and India. Her mother Carole has also spent many a time in the skies, having been a British Airways stewardess for several years before going into business and founding the family's company Party Pieces in 1987.","Pippa, 31, and parents Carole and Michael spotted boarding easyJet flight from Inverness to London Gatwick .

Lucia Cordaro, 37, is convinced that her security system, set up outside her home in Chester, has captured a clear image of one of the tiny mythical winged creatures flitting past the lens. She said she was getting in to bed when she heard a noisy motorbike revving outside her house. A mother claims to have proof that fairies do exist - after catching one of the mythical winged creatures on her home CCTV system . Lucia Cordaro, 37, is convinced that her security system, set up outside her home in Chester, has captured a clear image of a tiny fairy flitting past the lens . She later looked at the CCTV footage on her laptop she was shocked to see what she thought was a tiny tinkerbell flying past the camera . After creeping downstairs to investigate the commotion, the mother-of-one heard a bang and thought that somebody had hurled a missile at her window. But when she looked at the CCTV footage on her laptop she was shocked to see what she thought was a tiny tinkerbell flying past the camera. Ms Cordaro, a songwriter, said: 'I'm quite a logical person but I think seeing is believing.' She said she had only woken up to see what the noise outside was about. She said: 'It was just after 11pm and I was getting into bed. I live in the end house on my street and I could hear the motorbike on the corner.

'I thought 'if that's a butterfly it looks a lot like a fairy' but I mean, what are the chances? It's very strange. 'I was rewinding and rewinding and rewinding but the more I saw it the more I was convinced.' While some cynics might say the footage could be simply a moth flying past the camera lens,  one person is a confirmed believer - her four- year-old son. He immediately spotted the mystical creature and identified it as one of Santa's little helpers. She said: 'When I showed my four-year-old son he said ""Wow.

"Germany opened the door for Britain to claw back powers from Brussels yesterday as David Cameron received the red carpet treatment from Angela Merkel. Berlin is prepared to negotiate over whether some issues can be decided by member states rather than the EU, one of her allies said. Michael Meister, a leading member of Mrs Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union party, said Germany was ‘open for arguments’ about returning some powers.

Support: David Cameron is accompanied by his wife, Samantha Cameron and their three children to the guest house in Germany . It was a marked change of tone from the . German government, which in recent weeks has sought to downplay the . prospects of any renegotiation of Britain’s terms of EU membership. It came as Mr Cameron, wife Samantha and their three children spent the night at Schloss Meseberg, the German Chancellor’s official country retreat. Mr Cameron and Mrs Merkel held talks about the future of Europe, with the Prime Minister making the case for more reforms. The invitation was a boost for Mr . Cameron, who has called for Britain to negotiate a new deal with the EU . and then hold an in-out referendum on the package by 2017.

Family affair: The partners of both David Cameron and Angela Merkel chuckle as they join in on the official visit . Well received: David Cameron signs the official guest book as Angela Merkel looks on . Mr Meister indicated that Mrs Merkel is prepared to give some ground on British demands for reform because she is keen for the UK to stay in the EU. He also indicated that Berlin could countenance the end of the EU-wide working time directive and the return of working hours laws to Westminster. Mr Meister said Germany acknowledges the need to examine which powers are held in Brussels and which should not be. ‘In some cases we need common . solutions,’ he said. ‘We need intensive discussion and we need to see . what could go on European level and what could stay at the national . level.’ He confirmed that Berlin is keen to keep Britain as a key ally . against the protectionist, anti-capitalist economic policies of some . southern European nations.

Negotiations: Merkel is keen to keep Britain within the EU and is seen here, on the right, talking with David Cameron whilst walking around the gardens of Schloss Meseberg . ‘I think there are a lot of common ideas with the British side and the German side on it,’ he said. Earlier this week, Mr Cameron said . British voters’ support for EU membership was ‘wafer-thin’ and that the . EU ‘sometimes overreached itself with directives and interventions and . interference’. He stressed the need for a ‘more flexible Europe’. Andrea Leadsom, of the Fresh Start . Group which wants to renegotiate Britain’s relationship with the EU, . said Mr Cameron will seek a deal. ‘I don’t think anybody on the . backbenches or the frontbenches of any party thinks laying down the law . is at all possible or plausible or desirable,’ she said. ‘The Foreign Office have not . traditionally been incredibly brave or ambitious in negotiations. I . think David Cameron has been and will continue to be, so I think we are . in a very good place.’ But . Labour foreign affairs spokesman Douglas Alexander said the Prime .

"An anti-Islamic organisation has released a Barossa Valley-grown wine, named Hal & Al's 72 Virgins, to help fund their movement. The Q society, which is selling the sparkling wine in boxes of six for $72, advocates against Islam through various lectures and events which oppose the Muslim faith and  Sharia law .

'Consumption of this Australian wine may prevent you from entering the Islamic Paradise,' the bottle's label states. 'However, both the Jewish and Christian paradises remain open as alternative.' Rather than recognise their beverage as offensive, the group has simply dubbed it a 'conversation starter'.

These lectures, given by 'non-Muslim scholars of Islam, authors, politicians and civil rights campaigners', address the group's member's 'concern about the growing impact of Islam and Sharia Law on Australian government, businesses and communities'. The group also opposes halal certification schemes, which they claim are 'widely imposed on non-Muslims' through food taxes and employment discrimination in abattoirs.

"Programmes such as Happy Valley and Last Tango in Halifax have reversed a ‘long term decline’ in the relationship between the BBC and the North, says the corporation’s Director of England. But it is perhaps unsurprising Peter Salmon should make these comments, given that his wife Sarah Lancashire is the star of both shows. Salmon, who is in charge of the BBC’s Salford base, has revealed figures showing that ‘for the first time in living memory’ people in the North feel better represented than those in the rest of the UK. Scroll down for video . Peter Salmon, who is in charge of the BBC's Salford base, pictured, claimed the corporation has reconnected with the north of England following the success of Happy Valley and Last Tango in Halifax . Salmon, right, who earns £375,000-a-year is married to the star of the two shows, Sarah Lancashire, left . In 2011, before 3,000 BBC staff began working in MediaCity UK, in Salford, the corporation gave itself an internal score for the portrayal of people in the north of England of 6.30, compared with 6.48 for the rest of the UK. But numbers released today show the balance has shifted to 6.31 for the north of England and 6.29 for the rest of the UK. The highest score was given to northwest viewers with 6.48. Speaking at a Broadcast Press Guild event in London, Salmon, who earns a salary of £375,000 said: ‘When we did the big change and the big switch, we said this has got to transform the experience of licence fee payers right across the region. ‘So in the last two or three years we’ve halved the gap in consumption between the North and the rest of the UK. It used to be 4 percent because the BBC has been traditionally more southern centric broadcaster in terms of consumption. ITV were the kings and queens outside London but in recent years we’ve reversed that. ‘If we look at things like portrayal approval and things like that, do the people think the BBC reflects their lives, we now see for the first time in living memory people in the north of England feeling on a par to the rest of the UK, if not slightly better represented’. He put this down to the increase in programmes both set and produced in the region, such as drama Happy Valley and Last Tango in Halifax, both set in Yorkshire, and Inspector George Gently, set in Northumberland and County Durham. A number of formerly London-based departments, such as sport and children’s programming, moved to Salford three years ago and tent-pole shows such as Blue Peter and Match of the Day are also now produced there. He said that shows such as Last Tango in Halifax, pictured,  helped reverse the BBC's decline in the north . Salmon believes this has thawed even the frostiest of the BBC’s regional relationships. He said: ‘In the North East of England, which has always been one of the most chilly places for the BBC, it’s quite remote from London based organisations typically, we’ve really begun to reverse years of having a negative relationship either with the power structure in the North East or audiences. We’ve done it simply by making a lot more programmes in the Northeast.’ Happy Valley is a crime drama following the Yorkshire police sergeant Catherine Cawood, played by Sarah Lancashire, trying to come to terms with the suicide of her daughter. She becomes obsessed with the man who she believes raped her daughter and drove her to suicide. It transpires that the man is also involved in a kidnapping plot. Earlier this year Happy Valley prompted criticism for showing ‘gratuitous’ violence in a string of graphic scenes. The lead character - police sergeant Catherine Cawood, played by Sarah Lancashire - was savagely beaten in a basement during one episode. As the show ended, she collapsed in the road, her face covered in blood, leaving viewers guessing whether she had died. The scenes prompted 15 complaints from viewers. It followed a harrowing incident previously in which another policewoman was murdered on a lonely country road. An average of 5.8million viewers tuned in to Happy Valley’s first four instalments, and most praise its gripping plot and realistic police procedure. But some have expressed concern at its increasingly gruesome twists and graphic depictions of violence against women. Last Tango in Halifax is a romantic comedy series also starring Derek Jacobi and Anne Reid. Alan Buttershaw (Jacobi) and Celia Dawson (Reid) are both widowed and in their 70s. When their grandsons put them on Facebook, they rediscover their feelings for one another are as intense as they were 60 years ago when they were teenagers. Sarah Lancashire plays Anne Reid’s daughter Caroline in the series. Mr Salmon’s relationship with his common law wife collapsed in 2000 and it emerged that he and Miss Lancashire were an item several months later. Mr Salmon the former controller of BBC1, left the mother of his three sons, Penny Watt, after falling for the former Coronation Street star. Mr Salmon and Miss Lancashire got to know each other when he worked at Granada Television in Manchester. They have a son together and live in Twickenham, south-west London.","Peter Salmon said the BBC was improving its northern representation .

Evasive action: The Norwegian pilot shouts 'What the hell?!' before veering away sharply in the latest incident involving hundreds of other recent near misses with aggressive Russian fighter pilots . The incident has added to mounting tensions between Russia and NATO member states in recent months, underlined by claims of other recent near misses with Russian military jets. 'We don't know if it was a miscalculation or if he deliberately put himself in the path of our F-16,' said Stordal, adding that Norway's armed forces had informed Russia that the incident was 'undesirable'. The close encounter occurred in international airspace 'north of Norway' but the armed forces did not say when. Unlike neighbouring non-aligned Sweden, Norway - a NATO member - has not reported any airspace incursions by Russia in recent years and gauges the level of Russian air force activity in the area as 'pretty normal or a little more' than usual.

File picture . So far this year, Norway has scrambled its air force 43 times to identify 69 Russian planes, compared to 41 incidents involving 58 planes in 2013. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said last month that the alliance had reported 400 intercepts of Russian military flights so far this year - a 50 per cent increase compared to 2013. He complained that Russian jets flying without sharing their flight plans posed a danger to commercial air traffic. U.S. Ambassador to NATO Douglas Lute also revealed 'multiple incidents' where Russian military aircraft had not filed flight plans nor spoken to civilian air traffic controllers and had turned off transponders that send information about the plane. 'Danger to air traffic': NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg (above) said last month that the alliance had reported 400 intercepts of Russian military flights so far this year - a 50 per cent increase compared to 2013 . This made the planes virtually invisible to air traffic controllers, he told a news conference. 'These Russian actions are irresponsible, pose a threat to civilian aviation and demonstrate that Russia is flagrantly violating international norms,' he said. Britain also voiced concern about Russian probing of its air space. In late October, NATO said its aircraft tracked Russian strategic bombers over the Atlantic and Black Sea and sorties of fighters over the Baltic. At sea, too, Russia has been more active, leading one NATO commander to draw comparisons with Cold War behaviour. A squadron of Russian warships entered the English Channel on Friday.","Video shows Russian jet flashing into view just 65ft from Norwegian plane .

"Police in Utah arrested an elderly military veteran Tuesday morning following an 11-hour standoff that required the involvement of a SWAT team armed with powdered pepper spray. The suspect, who has not been named, allegedly fired a gun inside a recreational vehicle at around 12.30am in St. George. Police responded to the mobile home after getting a 911 call about shots fired, but the suspect barricaded himself inside the RV. Tense standoff: A St. George Police officer maintains his position surrounding a trailer home after reports of shots fired on Tuesday in St. George, Utah . Peaceful resolution: St. George police officers take a military veteran into custody after an 11-hour standoff . Trick: Cops had to resort to the use of powdered pepper spray in order to coax the man out of his RV . Smoked out: The elderly man came out of the RV on his own after police launched more pepper spray at his home . The veteran surrendered to police at around 11am after a SWAT team fired powdered pepper spray into the camper. The standoff resulted in the closure of nearby businesses, and people in a motel were told to stay in their rooms. According to the St George Police Department, the suspect fired about six shots inside his RV parked on East St. George Boulevard shortly after midnight. A SWAT team accompanied by crisis negotiators converged on the RV, and officers spent the next 10 hours trying to make contact with the man barricaded inside to coax him out, but to no avail. As time passed and police had not heard anything from the man, they decided to fire powdered pepper spray, known as OC powder, into the trailer to draw him out. The man was seen tossing items out the window and screaming at the cops, 'You are hurting me!' reported The Spectrum. How it started: The suspect allegedly fired several shots inside his mobile home, pictured, at around midnight . Closures: Police shut down St George Boulevard and several local businesses during the standoff . At that point, the veteran made contact with the SWAT team outside, but then the communication went silent again, prompting police to launch more pepper spray into the camper. At around 11.15am, the gray-haired veteran walked out of the RV and was taken into custody without incident. There was no one else inside the man's mobile home, and no injuries have been reported. If the suspect qualifies, his case will be heard in the veteran judicial court. St George Boulevard was shut down for several hours during the ordeal, along with a nearby Rite Aid pharmacy and a coffee and juice bar.","The suspect came out of his RV in St George after police repeatedly used powdered pepper spray to coax him out .

Three men, including a Ugandan and one from a Muslim country, failed to gain asylum when a Dutch court found they had not proved their sexuality. The European Court of Justice says EU states must respect human dignity. Its rulings apply for all EU member states. Refugees who claim asylum on the grounds that they are homosexual should not have to undergo tests to prove it, the EU's top court has ruled; pictured above Sub-Saharan migrants celebrate as they try to reach a immigrant holding centre after they jumped the border fence in Melilla, the Spanish enclave in northern Africa . The case involving the trio is significant because this year there has been a surge in the number of sub-Saharan Africans seeking asylum in Europe; most African countries treat homosexuality as a crime; desperate migrants are pictured trying to get over a border fence in Morocco . The case involving the trio is significant because this year there has been a surge in the number of sub-Saharan Africans seeking asylum in Europe, the BBC reported. Most African countries treat homosexuality as a crime. In 2011 the UN, EU and human rights activists criticised Czech authorities  for using an erection or 'phallometric' test - a practice dating back to communist times - to determine whether certain asylum seekers were gay. In its latest ruling, the court of justice said that determining a refugee's sexuality had to be consistent with EU law while also respecting their private and family life. It said evidence of homosexual acts submitted from tests or on film infringed human dignity, even if it was proposed by the asylum seeker. Allowing such evidence could result in it becoming a requirement, the court said. While authorities can ask questions about asylum seekers sexual orientation, they can't ask about their sexual practices. While authorities can ask questions about asylum seekers sexual orientation, they can't ask about their sexual practices, the court found . In its latest ruling, the court of justice said that determining a refugee's sexuality had to be consistent with EU law while also respecting their private and family life; pictured above, immigrants wait in line at a shelter in Crete after arriving on a cargo shop from Turkey . The judges said an asylum seeker's failure to answer questions about their personal circumstances was not sufficient reason to reject them. Nor was an applicant's failure to declare his homosexuality from the outset. Treatment of gay, lesbian or bisexual refugees has been highlighted in the UK in recent months following revelations one asylum seeker was asked 'shockingly degrading' questions. More than 10 per cent of interviews with asylum seekers involved questions of an 'unsatisfactory nature', a report in October by the UK independent chief inspector of borders and immigration found. Last year the court of justice ruled that gay asylum seekers who had a genuine fear of imprisonment in African countries could claim refugee status.","EU states must respect human dignity, the European Court of Justice says .

"Manchester United go to the Etihad hunting for three points as they take on Manuel Pellegrini's dishevelled Premier League champions. Here, Sportsmail's Jamie Redknapp gives his take on where the game could be won and lost. ANGEL DI MARIA v PABLO ZABALETA . I’ll be covering the game for Sky and this is the battle I am most looking forward to watching. It’s an all-Argentine affair and whoever comes out on top will probably end up on the winning side. Di Maria has had two quiet games – Branislav Ivanovic and Andre Wisdom were very physical and frustrated him. Zabaleta will offer that but will want to take him the other way - he’s one of the best raiding right backs we’ve seen in the Premier League. This will be a brilliant contest and absolutely key in deciding the game. Pablo Zabaleta (left) and Angel di Maria (right - Marcos Rojo centre) will do battle on Sunday afternoon . Argentina Di Maria has lit up the Premier League since moving to Manchester United from Real Madrid . Fellow countryman Zabaleta (left) is one of the division's toughest customers at full back . ROBIN VAN PERSIE v MARTIN DEMICHELIS/ELIAQUIM MANGALA . That goal against Chelsea will give Van Persie confidence and he got good opportunities against one of the meanest defences in the league. He still has a lot to offer but if he gets involved in a physical battle with Vincent Kompany, there will be only one winner. Van Persie needs to target Demichelis/Mangala instead because that’s where he’ll get his success. Robin van Persie's last-gasp equaliser against Chelsea will give him the confidence to kick on . Eliaquim Mangala has endured a tricky start to life in England after the defender's summer move from Porto .

Manuel Pellegrini may go with one up front to get more numbers in midfield, but if that one is Sergio Aguero, United are in for a tough afternoon. Aguero played alone at Barcelona last season and as the lone striker against Tottenham two weeks ago he was sensational. United need to get numbers around him because he preys on weak links. Smalling had one of his best ever games for United against Chelsea last week. He’ll need another one on Sunday.

It works so much better with no commentary.’ While the Royal Family, politicians and celebrities enjoyed the concert, Speaker’s wife Sally Bercow was absent from the celebrations. And despite being an ardent anti-monarchist, she took to Twitter to complain that she hadn’t had a VIP invitation. ‘I wish,’ she told one user who asked if she had been invited. ‘We get the stuffy, pompous perks mainly’ – referring to the fact that she and her husband had been invited to join the thanksgiving service yesterday at St Paul’s Cathedral.

"Mayor Bill de Blasio has slammed a group of NYPD officers as 'disrespectful' for turning their backs to him during a pair of funerals for slain police officers. In his first remarks on the officers' protests, De Blasio said that the actions were hurtful to the families of the two cops killed in an ambush last month. The public rebuke, he said on Monday, was an offense to the city at large. Police Commissioner William Bratton also condemned their actions. Scroll down for video . 'Direspectful': De Blasio today condemned officers who turned their back on him at the funeral of an officer shot dead by a gunman who said he was taking revenge for the death of Eric Garner . Defiant: The mass protest on Sunday came despite an appeal not to from Commissioner Bratton . 'I can't understand why': De Blasio slammed the back-turning as an offense against the entire city . The mayor, speaking to reporters at 1 Police Plaza, said he appreciated that many officers did not turn their backs. However, he is 'disappointed' by 'some individual officers' who did turn their backs. 'They were disrespectful to the families involved,' de Blasio said. 'They were disrespectful to the families who had lost their loved ones. I can't understand why anyone would do such a thing in the context like that.' The rift between the police unions and de Blasio has created the biggest crisis of his mayoralty. The unions have blamed de Blasio for fostering an anti-NYPD atmosphere they believe contributed to the murders of the officers. Thousands of police turned their backs on Sunday as  de Blasio eulogized an officer shot dead with his partner, repeating a stinging display of scorn for the mayor despite entreaties to put anger aside. The show of disrespect came outside the funeral home where Officer Wenjian Liu was remembered as an incarnation of the American dream: a man who had emigrated from China at age 12 and devoted himself to helping others in his adopted country. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and Police Commissioner Bill Bratton prepare to depart the wake of slain New York Police Officer Wenjian Liu at the Aievoli Funeral Home in Brooklyn . Honored: Despite moving to name a street in honor of Detectives Rafael Ramos (left) and Wenjian Liu (right) who were shot to death last month, Bill de Blasio has failed to appease thousands of NYPD officers . His young widow Pei Xia Chen, who married Liu just months earlier, paid a tearful tribute at the funeral, saying she had lost her 'soul mate' and a 'wonderful husband'. 'Wenjian will always be in my heart. I love you, I love you forever,' she told him. 'We spoke about work often and how much respect he had for the law, how he applied the law... with courtesy, with respect and with the highest professionalism.' The gesture among officers watching the mayor's speech on a screen added to tensions between the mayor and rank-and-file police even as he sought to quiet them. 'Let us move forward by strengthening the bonds that unite us, and let us work together to attain peace,' de Blasio said at the funeral. Last Saturday, the New York City Police Department buried a hero. Tens of thousands of officers from our department and hundreds of other departments came to show respect for detective first grade Rafael Ramos. His family witnessed the kind of love that only his second family in blue could display. But for the last seven days, the city's and the country's consciousness of that funeral has focused on an act of disrespect shown by a portion of those tens of thousands of officers. It was not all the officers, and it was not disrespect directed at Detective Ramos. But all the officers were painted by it, and it stole the valor, honor, and attention that rightfully belonged to the memory of Detective Rafael Ramos's life and sacrifice. That was not that intent, I know. But it was the result. On Sunday, we will gather together again, with the rest of New York City and law-enforcement officials nationwide, to mourn for Detective First Grade Wenjian Liu. We gather to support his parents, his widow, and everyone who is there to remember a life tragically cut short. The assassination of Detectives Liu and Ramos was an attack on us all. As a cop, one who lived and worked through the assassination threats of the 1970s, I understand that emotions are high. I issue no mandates, and I make no threats of discipline. But I remind you that when you don the uniform of this department, you are bound by the tradition, honor, and decency that go with it.","On Monday, Mayor Bill de Blasio made his first remarks about the protests .

"The Australian Open, dubbed The Australian sauna championships, saw many casualties following extreme heat at the Melbourne tennis grand slam event earlier this year, with temperatures scorching to over 40 degrees Celsius during a four day sweat-fest. One player hallucinated and fainted, another vomited and suffered severe cramping, while the searing heat also melted water bottles on court and incredibly even melted the soles of one player's sneakers.

And it wasn't just reserved for the players, a ball boy fainted during one of the matches while fans had to brave the blistering temps, some without shade. A wave of criticism followed the heat stricken open, surrounding the lack of transparency about when the 'heat policy' would be implemented which was at the discretion of the umpires. Tournament organisers were also accused of forcing players to perform in 'inhumane' conditions, which has now led Australian Open organisers to update their 'extreme heat policy' for next year's tournament. Firstly there's the addition of a third retractable-roof stadium on the new-look Margaret Court arena which will weather-proof the court. Secondly, the 'heat policy' will be updated to ensure conditions are fair for all players.

'When conditions exceed these levels the Referee is taking into account the forecast and state of play when making his discretionary call.' 'We've been gathering data for a number of years now and the forecast process is more sophisticated than ever before.' 'We believe this update will clarify and streamline the communications process for both players and support staff.' 'We've consulted the playing group and this is seen as the fairest way to implement the policy by many of the top players,' said Mr Tiley.

Meteorologist Bob Leighton says long range forecasts indicated a heat wave wasn't expected for next year's Grand Slam set to start on January 19. 'At this stage it's looking like a normal summer, perhaps slightly warmer, with only one day hitting around 40 degrees, and little or no rain forecast,' said Mr Leighton.","Australian Open organisers have updated their 'extreme heat policy' for next year's tournament .

"They emerged as a novel way for the rich and famous to expand their homes, but now 'mega basements' are set to be outlawed in one of Britain's wealthiest areas. The London borough of Kensington and Chelsea has become the first local authority in the country to introduce restrictions on controversial subterranean developments. Basement extensions several storeys below the ground have become increasingly popular in some of the capital's most expensive neighbourhoods as home-owners attempt to increase their living space without infringing strict planning controls. They have led to the creation of what are known as 'iceberg homes', with the extra space earmarked to accommodate private cinemas, spas and swimming pools. Scroll down for video . A private pool and adjoining leisure deck in the basement of . the houses at Wycombe Square in Kensington. However, the days of plush 'mega-basements' may be numbered in the desirable London area . Jon Hunt, founder of the estate agents Foxtons, and Hans Rausing, heir to the Tetra Pak fortune, were said to be among those to have sought permission for basement extensions in the capital in recent years. The trend has gathered pace in the last decade. The likes of Andrew Lloyd Webber, Nicole Kidman and Roman Abramovich have all extended underground. However, doing so comes at a premium. Last August, millionaire hedge fund boss Reade Griffith was order to pay £800,000 to create a huge two-storey underground basement below his two adjoining Kensington townhouses. He received the unprecedented levy from Kensington and Chelsea Council when he was granted planning permission for the extension, which houses a swimming pool, spa and 'treatment area'. The basements have drawn repeated complaints from neighbours about noise and dust. File picture . A view overlooking the rear of the property showing work in Kensington, London. File picture . In 2001 there were just 46 planning applications for basement developments in Kensington and Chelsea, rising to 450 last year. The council said they have also increased in size, with two and three-storey basements 'not uncommon'. They have drawn repeated complaints from neighbouring residents about noise and dust. Now after a two-year process, Kensington and Chelsea council has announced that a Government planning inspector has given the green light to its proposals to curb the scale of subterranean development. Actress Joan Collins hit out at her neighbours' basements in upmarket Belgravia - many of whom she said hardly even use their homes . Basement extensions will still be permitted but the new rules will restrict how far they can stretch under a garden, limit them to a single storey in most cases and ban developments under listed buildings altogether. Council cabinet member for planning policy Tim Coleridge said:'Basements have been the single greatest planning concern our residents have expressed to us in living memory. 'Many have experienced years of misery from noise, vibration, dust and construction traffic. 'Two years ago we started drafting a policy to try and strike the right balance between addressing our residents' concerns and the genuine need for people to expand their homes. 'It hasn't been easy and basement developers have aggressively opposed us every step of the way. We are delighted that the inspector agrees that we have got it right while at the same time praising us for our extensive public consultation. 'This ruling is a victory not only for the council but also our residents who have been overwhelmingly supportive of what we have been trying to do.' The new guidelines are set to be formally adopted at the next full council meeting in January. Actress Joan Collins expressed the outrage of many earlier this year, hitting out at her new neighbours in upmarket Belgravia - many of whom she said hardly even use their homes. The Dynasty actress, 80, told a residents' magazine: 'It's really sad. I find it shocking that people are digging down to put in swimming pools and bowling alleys when they only live here for two or three months of the year.' Queen guitarist Brian May also took umbrage at building work near his Kensington home. Writing online last month he said: 'Kensington used to be a nice quiet decent place to live... now it's becoming a hellhole'. Well-heeled residents have started to hit back - in June of last year Pamela, Countess Listowel, joined 57 other resident in Camden in lodging an official objection to basement plans on her Victorian street.","Kensington and Chelsea has  introduced restrictions on developments .

"For many people the chance to drive a supercar, particularly a rare Ferrari that is one of only around 300 ever made, is a dream. But one driver saw the experience go badly wrong when he apparently lost control of the car and collided with a lamp post. The Ferrari F50, which is estimated to be worth around £850,000, was left with a badly damaged rear. Scroll down for video . The Ferrari F50 is worth an estimated £850,000 and repairing the car could prove a costly job for its insurers . Repairing it is likely to be expensive and could make the crash Britain's most expensive involving one car. The Ferrari, which is not understood to have been written off, is thought to be the most valuable car involved in a crash since Rowan Atkinson badly damaged his £3m McLaren F1 in 2011. He has since received a £1m insurance payout for the crash to repair the supercar. The Ferrari F50 is one of 349 of the cars ever made and was produced to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Italian car manufacturer. The rare Ferrari was left with a badly damaged rear after the driver appeared to lose control at a roundabout . The Ferrari F50 is one of 349 of the cars ever made to celebrate the car company's 50th anniversary . It is seen by some as an 'F1 car for the road' and can go from 0 to 60mph in just over three seconds. Seamus O'Brien, 49, from Leicester, was one of the first people to arrive at the scene of the crash, which took place on Wednesday morning  on the A43 in Northamptonshire.

The car is estimated to be worth £850,000 . It was introduced in 1995 . The car has two doors and two seats . Has a removable hard top . The last F50 was produced in Italy in July 1997 . He said: 'I was driving on the A43 near Brackley and saw the Ferrari wrapped around the lamppost. 'There was a chap wearing a Ferrari T-shirt stood besides another chap and another car had put its hazard lights on to block the lane which was 50 yards off the westbound roundabout. 'It looked like a test drive gone wrong and they had clearly come around the roundabout to head towards Silverstone and applied too much power. 'They're very unforgiving to drive and despite the very dry weather conditions, the driver clearly gave it too much welly and spun the car into the lamppost. 'Nobody was hurt apart from some seriously damaged egos.' A spokesperson for Northamptonshire Police said: 'We were called at 11.11am on Wednesday morning to reports a silver Ferrari was involved in a collision with a lamppost. 'The lamppost and the car were damaged, but there were no injuries.' Rowan Atkinson lost control of his McLaren F1 supercar, leading to repairs on the £3m car which cost £1m . Mr Bean actor Rowan Atkinson last year received a £1m insurance payout to cover repairs after he badly damaged his McLaren F1 supercar in 2011, breaking his shoulder in the crash.

"Set for stardom: Madeleine Harris was picked from hundreds of hopefuls for a part in Paddington . A British schoolgirl is set for stardom after being plucked from obscurity to play a lead role in the new Paddington film. Madeleine Harris, 13, of Shepton Mallet, Somerset, was picked from hundreds to play Judy Brown, the daughter of the family who take in the loveable Peruvian bear. The film, based on the Paddington Bear books by Michael Bond, stars big names such as Nicole Kidman, Hugh Bonneville, Julie Walters, Jim Broadbent and Peter Capaldi. It is Madeleine's movie debut and she had to endure a series of interviews and callbacks before she was given the part. The schoolgirl rubbed shoulders with the stars at the London premier but is now back in classes while the film launches around the world. Madeleine was initially rejected for looking too young but was offered the role a few months later. She said: 'The first thought I had was ""I've grown!"" Because I've always been really small. 'I was really shocked, it still has not really dawned on me I'm in the film. I'm only just starting to realise. 'I couldn't really give you my favourite part of filming because I loved it all so much, but filming late at night in the Natural History Museum was great. 'It was really quite eerie, you would go into rooms and it would be all dark and you would just see bones and hear the music still playing, it was really creepy but so much fun.' Madeleine, who studies at Shepton Mallet's Whitstone School, managed to complete the filming without missing out on her school work. 'It was actually really easy to balance school and filming,' she added . 'All the teachers at Whitstone are fab and would tell me what I'd missed and set work. Scroll down for video . Madeleine Harris is pictured left as her character Judy Brown during one of her scenes in the new Paddington film .

'The school were just so good and made it so, so easy for me to manage everything.' Ian Law, a history teacher at Whitstone School, added: 'She is absolutely brilliant, she takes it all in her stride. 'She was in all last week, despite the film premiering, and has been doing really well in her lessons.

'She is so laid back about it all and really hasn't let it get to her head, she's a real credit.' Madeline kick started her acting career after meeting Idris Elba in London, where she was living while her parents ran a pub. The schoolgirl told the star of Luther and The Wire about her passion for acting and he arranged a meeting with his agent where she was immediately signed up. Paddington opened in cinemas last Friday . Although this is Madeleine's first role on the big screen the teen is no stranger to acting roles. Her first acting job was a part in BBC drama Casualty where she played Izzy Forrester, who caused a car crash. 'It was great fun,' she said, 'and still one of the funnest jobs I've done. On my first day I was running across a motorway with cars driving past.' She has since appeared in television programmes including Mr and Mrs Jones, Man Down, and BBC drama the White Queen. Madeleine said her friends at school had been 'great' about her acting. 'They're really funny,' she said. 'I have some of the older people in the school come up to me as a joke asking me to sign things. 'It's really funny and a great laugh, everyone's so great about it. It's not a big deal really, we don't tend to talk about it much.' She added her advice for anyone wanting to be an actor is 'anything is possible'. 'Don't give up. If you carry on wanting it then you can achieve it,' she said. Paddington opened in cinemas last Friday.","Madeleine Harris plucked from obscurity to play lead role in Paddington .

It will be the first time Van Gaal has been in the dugout for an all-Manchester match-up and the Dutchman could field up to five derby debutants for the hotly-contested clash. But he is sure they will all understand what the fixture means to the club after a pep talk from assistant manager Ryan Giggs this week. 'Ryan Giggs presented the analysis of Manchester City, and I felt more tension (about the derby) with him. It was good to see that,' Van Gaal said. 'He knows it, he has the experience as a player and now maybe as an assistant manager.' Rooney joined the rest of his  United team-mates at the launch of the club's sponsorship with Bulova watches and he also wore a Matalan Alphabet scarf  in support of Alder Hey Children's Hospital Charity . Manchester United captain  Rooney has been suspended since his red card against West Ham last month . Tensions have run high in the build up to the clash but Van Gaal insists his players must not be overcome by emotion on Sunday afternoon. Wayne Rooney (United) - 11 . Joe Hayes (City) - 10 . Francis Lee (City) - 10 . Bobby Charlton (United) - 9 . Colin Bell (City) - 8 . Eric Cantona (United) - 8 . Brian Kidd (United and City) - 8 . Joe Spence (United) - 8 . He added: 'We don't have to accelerate this feeling because it is football and you have to play the game, not only a game with emotion but also in a tactical way. 'For me, I have to analyse and prepare for the games in the same manner (as the other matches).' Wayne Rooney will start Sunday’s Manchester derby but Van Gaal will once again be without Radamel Falcao, who is still injured. Rooney is back from suspension and fit to captain United against Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium after being seen limping at Old Trafford earlier this week. Colombia striker Falcao remains sidelined, however, following the knock he picked up in training a week ago. Carrick (front) is in contention to play his first game of the season for United after an ankle injury . Van Gaal told a press conference on Friday afternoon: 'Rooney is fine, he was never injured. 'Maybe he was wearing his shoes too tight. He is my captain and he will start the game. 'Falcao is still injured but [Antonio] Valencia is back.' The United skipper has scored 11 goals against City, the most notable of which came in February 2011 when he put away a spectacular overhead kick to seal a 2-1 win at Old Trafford. 'I have heard that also he has scored a lot of goals against Manchester City, the most of any player,' said Van Gaal, whose claim is accurate. 'I said that to him to stimulate him but he doesn't need that. Angel di Maria appeared in a relaxed mood during Manchester United's training session on Friday . Marcos Rojo (left) and Antonio Valencia could be two of many South Americans involved at the Etihad . The return of Rooney (left) to the line-up is likely to mean Mata (right) will be dropped to the bench against City . Marouane has had a resurgence in recent weeks, and could start against City on SUnday . 'I am very happy that he can play again and he shall play.' Van Gaal, looking forward to his first Manchester derby, says it will be the biggest local rivalry that he has managed, and recognises what it means to the city. 'This is the biggest derby that I shall manage. It is one of 38 [league] matches we have to play, but for the fans it is unbelievably big as a rivalry and I have felt that also with a lot of the players in the squad, but also especially with Ryan Giggs. 'When he presented the analysis on City, I felt more tension with him. It was good to see.' One player who could be key to United's chances is Marouane Fellaini, whose performances over the past two games have seen him back to his best. Van Gaal thinks so too. United attempt to regroup at the Etihad during last year's 4-1 defeat by their cross-city rivals . Yaya Toure was on song as United were beaten 3-0 by City towards the end of last season . 'He has made a great contribution and also the assist for the [Chelsea] goal. 'He has had a lot of time out injured but when he is fit I have played him. He has to continue with that because then I am very pleased.' United lost their two clashes with City by an aggregate score of 7-1 last term; 4-1 at the Etihad and 3-0 at Old Trafford under David Moyes. Midfielder David Silva will miss Sunday's derby  after being ruled out for around three weeks with a knee injury. Fellow midfielder Yaya Toure is expected to feature despite being withdrawn during Wednesday's Capital One Cup loss to Newcastle amid concerns about a groin problem.

"Wakefield’s Super League play-off hopes were dealt a body blow after they crashed to a first home defeat under coach James Webster. The Wildcats never recovered from a dismal first half after which they trailed a rampant Huddersfield 32-0 and, although they produced a spirited revival, a 36-18 defeat leaves them four points behind eighth-placed Widnes with four games left of the regular season. Huddersfield, with former England hooker Shaun Lunt in impressive form on his return from a two-month injury lay-off, were dominant from the start, despite the late withdrawal of winger Jodie Broughton and prop Antonio Kaufusi. Easy pickings: The impressive Shaunt Lunt (centre) celebrates after scoring in the easy win at Wakefield . Webster was also forced to make a late change, switching Jarrod Sammut from stand-off to full-back in the absence of the injured Richard Mathers, and the Australian experienced mixed fortunes in his new role. He conceded a penalty from the kick-off by putting the ball straight into touch and the visitors scored inside their first set, with half-backs Luke Robinson and Danny Brough working the ball out wide for centre Joe Wardle to touch down for the first of their six tries before the break. Brough disputed referee James Child’s decision to disallow his conversion, after the two touchjudges came to different conclusions over the accuracy of the kick, but it hardly mattered as Huddersfield went on to win at a canter. Lunt made his first impact on nine minutes when his short pass got prop Eorl Crabtree charging over for the Giants’ second try and it was all Huddersfield as winger Jermaine McGillvary was denied by Paul Sykes’ last-ditch tackle and front rower Anthony Mullally was held up over the line. There was no respite for the Wildcats when Mullally went off as a barnstorming run from his replacement Craig Kopczak created the position for Lunt to force his way over from dummy half before taking Lunt’s pass to cross himself. Lunt went off for a well-earned breather on 28 minutes and his replacement, teenager Kruise Leeming, was quickly into the action, taking Robinson’s pass to score his first try of the season after Sammut had dropped Brough’s high kick. Wakefield spent virtually the whole of the first 40 minutes inside their own half and, on a rare foray near the visitors’ line, spilled ball and watched McGillvary sprint 95 metres for an opportunist 18th try of the season. Leading 32-0 at the break, it was always going to be difficult for the Giants to maintain their sparkling form and the Wildcats, boosted by the arrival from the bench of forwards Ali Lauitiiti and Taulima Tautai, enjoyed a good deal more possession to enable them to redeem themselves. Sammut scored one try four minutes into the second half, which he converted, looked to have added another only to be pulled back for a forward pass and was then held up over the line. Wildcats’ pressure eventually told when hooker Paul McShane got stand-off Sykes through a yawning gap in the Huddersfield defence and Sammut kicked his second goal. It was a far more even contest in the second half, with the Giants scoring their only other try through teenager Jake Connor, who switched from the wing to full-back in the absence of Scott Grix for the second half. The Wildcats were well beaten but they had the final say when second rower Danny Kirmond got out an offload that enabled Sammut to score his second try and he also kicked his third goal.","Former England hooker Lunt had been out for two months .

"At least 29 people, including 20 women, have been shot dead in Iraq in an apparent attack on a brothel. Gunmen wearing camouflage burst into two apartments in Baghdad yesterday evening before massacring everyone inside, according to police. While no group has yet claimed responsibility for the murders, locals believe the killings were carried out by Shiite militants opposed to prostitution. Gunmen in Baghdad have executed at least 29 people including 20 women in an apparent raid on a brothel . A police officer speaking on condition of anonymity said: 'When we walked up the stairs, we saw a couple of women's bodies and blood streaming down the stairs. 'We entered a flat and found bodies everywhere, some lying on the sofa, some on the ground, and one woman who apparently had tried to hide in a cupboard in the kitchen shot to death there.' The attacks happened late on Saturday night at an apartment block in Zayouna, a mixed Sunni and Shiite district of Baghdad. Police believe men using silenced weapons carried out the executions, before scrawling 'this is the fate of any prostitution' on one of the doors. Officers have now cordoned off the street, with residents reporting that the sole access point to the building has been blocked off. Shiite militias have become more active on the streets of Baghdad since Sunni militants led by jihadist fighters took over large swathes of eastern and northern Iraq a month ago. While nobody has claimed responsibility for the attack, it is thought Shiite militants are behind it . Sunni ISIS fighters have seized most of the country's north, including all of its borders with Syria, in an attempt to set up a single Islamic state across country lines. The sudden assault by ISIS earlier this year lead marches by Shiite Muslims in Iraq's capital in a show of defiance. Violence is at its highest level in Iraq in recent years according to the UN, with 2,417 people killed in June, the majority of them civilians, the highest number since 2007. The latest attacks in Baghdad mirror executions carried out by Shiite militias in May 2013 in the same district, when gunmen attacked brothels and alcohol shops. Seven women and five men were killed on that occasion after gunmen burst into a brothel, while 12 shopkeepers died after militants restrained a nearby police officer before shooting them. The deaths happened in the Zayouna district of Baghdad, the same district where seven women and five men were shot in a similar attack in May last year .","Gunmen dressed in camouflage and using silencers raid brothel in Baghdad .

"Education Minister Chris Pyne has been told to ‘man up’ by the Today Show’s Karl Stefanovic, who blasted ‘you can’t even get your policy through your own people’. Stefanovic stuck his teeth into Pyne a day after he grilled Prime Minister Tony Abbott about the axed carbon tax and federal budget, saying: ‘No one is buying what you are selling, what you are laying down. That is the problem.’ 'The reality here is that the budget position is in a shambles and every day it does get worse,’ he told the PM, as it was revealed Abbott’s popularity has fallen. Pyne appeared on the Today Show to discuss his unpopular Higher Education reforms as the government vowed it will launch a second attempt to pass them despite a Senate defeat on Tuesday. Scroll down for video . Today Show’s Karl Stefanovic told Education Minister Chris Pyne to 'man up' on Wednesday morning . Education minister Christopher Pyne later gave a press conference at Parliament House in Canberra . When Stefanovic pointed out ‘not even your own party has any faith in your arguments for existing reforms,’ Pyne argued: ’75 per cent of the budget is through.’ ‘Here’s the issue you can’t get your own policies through the Senate - and yes it’s hostile - but you can’t even get it through your own people,’ Karl laughed. ‘That’s not right Karl… I’m not in the least bit dismayed… my view is that’s democracy… this morning I am bouncing back and puting up a new reform bill,’ Pyne said. On Tuesday night Pyne was forced to deny that he ‘harassed’ senators in order to get them to support his higher education reforms, insisting that he holds an 'excellent relationship' with the Senate's crossbenchers. Pyne commented on the Government's higher education reform, after it was voted down in the Senate . PUP Senator Glenn Lazarus speaks in the Senate chamber at Parliament House in Canberra, Tuesday . Palmer United Party Senator Glenn Lazarus accused the Education Minister of pestering him and others in a statement, saying he'd been 'inundated with text messages from Christopher Pyne' despite having never given him his mobile number. But Mr Pyne dismissed the accusations, suggesting that the 'seven or eight' messages he'd sent Senator Lazarus were entirely acceptable and telling ABC's 7.30 Report that he would be 'happy to send him more'. Asking him about the allegations, Stefanovic jibed: ‘He’s a newly minted senator with virtually no experience, he was mocking you.’ Pyne vowed he will bounce back and propose a new version of the Higher Education reforms . He denied he was being blackmailed when Stefeanovic probed him about senators who did not vote for his reforms . ‘That’s a matter for Senator Lazarus. I intend to have a great relationship with him,’ Pyne replied. Announcing: ‘Today we’ll introduce a new higher education reform bill that picks up a lot of the issues that were raised by the crossbenchers, none by Labor or the Greens they are just saying “no” and are not part of the debate at all.’ ‘Whose fault is it that the bill was rejected?,’ Stefanovic asked. ‘Well the crossbenchers, the Labors and the Greens didn’t vote for it – four of the crossbenches did… great reform takes time, there is an inevitability about it because it’s great for our universities and students,’ Pyne said. Stefanovic continued his offence: ‘Ultimately you’ve got massive dramas getting any bill passed do you think that the senators are holding the country to ransom at the moment – are they blackmailing the country?’ The Prime Minister appeared on Channel Nine's Today show on Tuesday morning and faced a barrage of questions from host Karl Stefanovic over his controversial budget decisions . Avoiding answering the question, Pyne said: ‘As I see this, it is round two. As I said to Clive Palmer if it loses the first time it will be like losing the first test of a five test series.’ ‘They are blackmailing you in a way though aren’t they?,’ Stefanovic retorted. ‘I wouldn’t say that,’ Pyne said. ‘I think the PM said something like that yesterday “this is a form of blackmail”,’ Stefanovic reasoned. ‘I think he was saying… voting no in the Senate because you can’t have your way on one particular thing is not the way to negotiate with the government or with anybody,’ Pyne said. Stefanovic finished: ‘Why don’t you just double dissolution, man up and get on with it? ‘We’ve had a great year,’ Pyne replied. Education Minister Christopher Pyne has denied that he was 'harassing' Palmer United Party Senator Glenn Lazarus in order to gain his support for his higher education reforms package . The Abbott government will have another go at overhauling universities, defying defeat and bringing a new-look bill before parliament. Pyne will on Wednesday introduce a redrafted bill to deregulate universities, after the Senate knocked back the first attempt on Tuesday. Despite pleading with crossbench senators, the government failed to convince enough to jump on board the policy. The government will have to work on the Palmer United Party, Jacqui Lambie and Nick Xenophon to get the new bill through the Senate early next year. The redrafted bill will include other crossbench amendments that dump plans to increase interest rates on HECS and freeze interest charges while new parents take time out to raise kids. It will also include a scholarship fund targeted towards disadvantaged and rural students. On Tuesday Pyne also made an ironic slip when pronouncing the name of cross bencher Zhenya 'Dio' Wang while insisting he had an 'excellent relationship' with him - a mistake that was quickly pointed out by ABC reporter Leigh Sales. ABC journalist Leigh Sales, pointed Mr Pyne's ironic slip when pronouncing the name of cross bencher Zhenya 'Dio' Wang . 'Well some people pronounce it Wang, some people pronounce it Wong; it depends where you are on the spectrum. But if you wish to pick me up on that Leigh, that's a very small thing and I'm surprised you'd bother with it. Never the less, Dio and I are good friends and I will continue to try and get their support,' he replied to the quip. Clearly put-off by the slip, Mr Pyne then scolded Ms Sales, instructing her to study a bachelor of political science after being asked about the frequency of which he met with the crossbenchers and the quality of the relationships they shared. 'I have met with some of the crossbenchers many, many times – in fact I've met with some of them six or seven or eight times, but I'm not going to go through the day-to-day machinations of how government works, Leigh,' he said. 'You can go and study that at university if you wish to, in a bachelor of political science. The reality is that I'm working closely with the cross bench, I secured four of their votes today and I'll be back at it again tomorrow with a new reform bill.'","Chris Pyne appeared on the Today Show on Wednesday morning .

"Legal past: Hillary Clinton, pictured in 1980, helped a man accused of child rape get a lighter sentence . In a newly unearthed audio interview Hillary Clinton reveals how she managed to get a plea bargain for a man accused of raping a 12-year-old girl - and shockingly laughs as she indicated she knew he may have been guilty. During the course of the conversation which dates from the early 1980s, Clinton, then 27, outlines how she used a mistake by the prosecution to get 41-year-old Thomas Alfred Taylor to walk free. Indeed, so cavalier is her attitude to securing the freedom of a man suspected of raping a child that the shocking and candid interview may tarnish her role as an advocate for women and children in the United States. The . recordings which date from 1983-1987 were discovered by the Washington . Free Beacon and are of Clinton recalling her role in the most important . criminal case of her career. This is not the first time that the trial has been written about. In . 2008 at the height of her primary battle with Barack Obama, a Newsday . story focused on Clinton's deeply controversial strategy of attacking . the credibility of the girl. 'Rodham, . records show, questioned the sixth grader’s honesty and claimed she had . made false accusations in the past. She implied that the girl often . fantasized and sought out ‘older men’ like Taylor, according to a July . 1975 affidavit signed ‘Hillary D. Rodham' ‘in compact cursive,' wrote . Newsday. Scroll Down to Listen to the Audio Interview . Difficult case: Hillary Clinton (seen here in 1975) defended Thomas Alfred Taylor, a 41-year-old accused of raping the child after luring her into a car that same year . In 1975, the year she married Bill, Clinton was the court appointed attorney for Thomas Alfred Taylor. The frontrunner for the 2016 presidential race goes into detail over five hours with Arkansas reporter Roy Reed during the interview, which was intended for an Esquire magazine profile that was never published. Clinton describes Taylor as 'one of those rootless folks' and claims that the trial was a 'really interesting case.' Taylor was accused of raping the 12-year-old girl in May, 1975, in Springdale, Arkansas. The girl was a family friend and Clinton has acknowledged in her past 2003 memoir, Living History, the difficulties the case provided her having just moved to Fayetteville. to run the University of Arkansas' new legal aid clinic. 'This guy was accused of raping a 12-year-old. Course he claimed that he didn’t, and all this stuff,' says Clinton. However, what is most shocking is the breezy manner in which she discusses her clients crime and the offhand way in which she questions his innocence. 'I had him take a polygraph, which he passed – which forever destroyed my faith in polygraphs,' she says with a laugh. Listen to the Audio Interview Here: . Career path: Bill and Hillary in 1969. In 1975, the year the couple were married, Clinton represented Thomas Taylor in her first trial as a criminal defense lawyer . Indeed, Clinton laughs during several different parts of the interview - especially when she discusses the forensic lab destroying key evidence - which led to Taylor getting away with the crime. But, Ronald Rotunda, a professor of legal ethics at Chapman University, told the Washington Free Beacon. 'We don’t have to believe the client is innocent…our job is to represent the client in the best way we can within the bounds of the law.' However, he did raise the possibility that Clinton may have breached the attorney-client privilege by discussing the case so openly. 'You can’t do that,' he said. 'Unless the client says: ‘You’re free to tell people that you really think I’m a scumbag, and the only reason I got a lighter sentence is because you’re a really clever lawyer.’ Taylor was accused of plying the girl with whisky and coke and raping her in his car that evening. Part of the prosecution case against him was the testimony of the girl, two witnesses who saw them together and a 'pair of men's undershorts taken from the defendant herein.' Crucially, even though Clinton was attacking the credibility of the girl's character, it was the underwear that allowed her client to walk free. 'You know, what was sad about it,' Clinton told Reed, 'was that the prosecutor had evidence, among which was Taylor’s underwear, which was bloody.' Advocate: Hillary Clinton, former U.S. secretary of state, speaks at the Children's Defense Fund's 40th Anniversary Celebration in Washington September 30, 2013 . However, the crime investigation lab failed to handle the evidence correctly. 'The crime lab took the pair of underpants, neatly cut out the part that they were gonna test, tested it, came back with the result of what kind of blood it was what was mixed in with it – then sent the pants back with the hole in it to evidence,' said Clinton. 'Of course the crime lab had thrown away the piece they had cut out.' Jumping on this error, Clinton had the underwear taken to a renowned New York City forensic expert for confirmation that this evidence was now compromised. 'The story through the grape vine was that if you could get this investigator interested in the case then you had the foremost expert in the world willing to testify, so maybe it came out the way you wanted it to come out,' she said. 'Well this guy’s ready to come from New York to prevent this miscarriage of justice,' said a laughing Clinton on the tape describing her conversation with the Arkansas prosecutor. In his opinion there was not enough blood on it to test and this ultimately caused Judge Maupin Cummings to decide that offering Taylor a plea deal would be the best option. Distressed: The victim has accused Clinton, pictured at the Children's Defense Fund's 40th anniversary last year, as a hypocrite for calling herself a champion on women's rights . Accusations: Hillary Clinton, pictured with daughter Chelsea earlier this month. The victim of a sex offender she represented has spoken out about how Clinton treated the case . Taylor, who died in 1992, pleaded guilty to unlawful fondling of a child and was sentenced to one year in prison, which was reduced to two months for time served. However, her cavalier attitude to the rape case comes just over six months after she was honored by the Children's Defense Fund at its 40th anniversary soiree last September at the Kennedy Center. And, ironically, the trial was instrumental in Clinton co-founding the first rape crisis hotline in Fayetteville. But not once in the interview with Reed does Clinton mention the hotline she set up or the impact of the case on the 12-year-old girl. The Free Beacon tracked down the victim, now aged 52, who still lives in Fayettevile. She said that she was divorced and an addict to methamphetamines and was in prison for check forgery to pay for her drugs. She expressed hostility towards Clinton for getting her rapist off and said her life has been miserable since.","Hillary Clinton defended Thomas Alfred Taylor, 41, in 1975 in Fayettville, Arkansas .

"Child killer Ronald Salazar, who has served a decade of a life sentence for the horrific murder of his sister, has returned to court to be re-sentenced . A child killer who has served a decade of a life sentence for the horrific murder of his sister has returned to court to be re-sentenced, with the possibility he could serve less jail time. Ronald Salazar was just 14 when he raped and strangled his 11-year-old sister before slitting her throat in their South Miami Heights home in 2005, a court heard. Salazar's return to court follows a decision by the US Supreme Court in 2012 banning mandatory life sentences without the possibility of parole for juvenile killers. Salazar told Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Ellen Sue Venzer at the re-sentencing  that his entire life had been 'messed up' after his parents abandoned him in El Salvador while they made their way into the United States in 1991. He claimed he had been left with 'abusive' relatives until age 10 when his family finally called for him to make the three journey across the Arizona desert and join them in Miami- where they then treated him as an outcast. His parents, Samuel and Nuvia Salazar, didn't attend the proceedings. 'I just wanted them to see everything I had gone through,' said Salazar, according to the Miami Herald. 'I thought they were going to embrace my pain, that they were going to say, 'I'm sorry, we left you there that whole time by yourself. 'It was nothing like that. They said they had a rougher life, that I didn't have the right to complain. I felt rejected.' He began to lash out and was committed to a hospital for a psychological evaluation after threatening to kill himself and his family. Salazar murdered his little sister Marina 'Estefani' Salazar in July 2005 soon after his release from hospital by cutting her throat from ear-to-ear. He then tried to cover his tracks by wiping the knife clean and making up a story about men storming the house and killer her, the court heard. It took a jury just two hours at his trial in 2009 to convict him after prosecutors produced DNA evidence and a videotaped confession. Salazar had claimed he was insane and suffered a mental breakdown. The court in the trial heard he had hated his parents and killed his sister Estefani as revenge for them leaving him in El Salvador. Salazar (left) murdered his little sister Marina 'Estefani' Salazar (right) in July 2005 by strangling her and cutting her throat . This week's hearing heard that Salazar had been mentally scarred by his parents' decision to abandon him in El Salvador, where he was sexually abused aged 7 and ran with street gangs, and was not made to feel welcome when he finally joined them. Salazar also claimed  his parents told him they had a witch doctor remove a 'voodoo' spell from his father only to cast it upon him as a baby. In tears, he admitted he felt he didn't deserve a second chance but wanted to prove 'I'm not that animal.' However, prosecutor Reid Rubin, pointed out the killer had  boasted of the murder in prison and claimed he could still use his gang connections to have his parents killed  from behind bars. Salazar raped his sister because he knew he'd never be with another woman once jailed, the court heard. Salazar said he had no answer to why he raped the 11-year-old. 'I really do wish I had an answer to that question,' he said. 'There is no reason. She was sweet. She never did anything to me.' The Supreme Court barred mandatory life prison terms for juveniles after research showed that young people's brains are more susceptible to impulses and the influence of others. The law allows for judicial 'review' after 25 years for juveniles serving life for murder but does not apply to cases from before July 1, 2014. The 24-year-old's hearing comes after a decision by the US Supreme Court in 2012 which banned mandatory life sentences without the possibility of parole for juvenile killers .","Ronald Salazar was convicted of murdering his little sister in 2005 .

"A structure in the heart of Mongolia’s Gobi Desert – lost for a thousand years and marked on maps as ‘The Wall of Genghis Khan’ – has been revealed as still standing and part of the Great Wall. British researcher William Lindesay, aided by Google Earth, GPS and several other experts, found the new section last Autumn in Ömnögovi Province, a sensitive region 25 miles north of the China-Mongolian border. The Great Wall of China is in fact many different structures built over hundreds of years along different routes by various dynasties - this find is the first time a section has been discovered outside China. Remarkable: This part of the newly discovered Wall was constructed from earth and branches and built in 115 B.C . High life: Here the Wall is routed up and over an ancient volcanic cone and is composed of black blocks of basalt . ‘We followed the Wall there for about . 100 kilometres (60 miles), parallel to Mongolia’s southern border with . China and made some unexpected discoveries in terms of both the Wall’s . condition and its probable age,’ said Lindesay, who was joined on the . expedition by China-Mongolia border region expert Dr.Tjalling Halbertsma . and Mongolian geographer and desert specialist Professor Baasan . Tudevin. ‘In one location we found the Wall preserved to a height of around 2.5 metres (eight feet) and made up of earth and branches of a desert shrub called saksaul.’ In another location about 15 miles away the team discovered that the same Wall detoured off its flat and straight course and went up and over an ancient volcanic cone. No . one knows for certain how long the Wall actually is, because it’s not . one structure, but many, built by different dynasties, which follow . different routes. However, Lindesay believes there’s well over 30,000miles of Wall altogether. Some parts of the Wall stand 26-feet high. In places the Wall strides across mountains 3,200-feet above sea level. The Ming dynasty (14th to 17th century) is responsible for building much of what exists today, which measures over 4,000 miles. ‘Going over the mountain it was constructed from black blocks of basalt and stands around 1.5 metres (five feet) high as a prominent landscape feature,’ said Lindesay, who is one of the world’s leading authorities on the Wall, having spent 25 years studying it. He believes that of all the examples of the Wall of Genghis Khan in Mongolia, these are in the best condition. He said: ‘Previously, researchers have seen parts of the so-called Wall of Genghis Khan in different regions of Mongolia where it was found only to exist as a mere mound, barely higher than its surroundings,’ he explained. ‘We found a real Wall here, thanks to Google Earth and Professor Baasan’s navigation of our vehicles across 150 km (93 miles) of desert devoid of human activity right to our target. ‘We “followed” the Wall as a faint line on Google Earth across our computer screens for vast distances and were encouraged by a few stretches that showed dark shadows, which indicated the possibility of the Wall standing higher.’ Despite the name assigned to this part of the Wall, Lindesay doesn’t believe that Genghis Khan was actually responsible for building it. Wild life: Gazelle tracks beside the Wall of Genghis Khan . Sketch map of Mongolia showing the various Walls of Genghis Khan . He said: ‘Genghis Khan was a conquerer, not a defender, and it seems his name is given as a “brand name” to various things in Mongolia - so we believe it’s just an honorific name on the Wall.’ Its history, is not straightforward. He said: ‘The Wall of Genghis Khan in Ömnogovi appears to be a missing piece of the Han Dynasty Great Wall which was routed through the heart of the Gobi around 115 B.C. If we look at maps and Google Earth, it’s pretty clear that the Wall on either side of the border was in fact the same structure - the Han Great Wall - in ancient times.

The Ming Dynasty Great Wall of China: This is the structure that tourists visit most often today that you'll see on postcards . The Han Dynasty Great Wall structures, which were built between 206BC and 220 AD . ‘Now it’s a remnant of the Great Wall marooned outside China.’ Radiocarbon dating, however, revealed that some of the wall must have been rebuilt at various times. ‘Sample testing on three pieces carried out in the U.S. proved that the saksaul branches from the Wall were cut during the 12th century - a fact that suggests it was reconstructed at that time - by a later dynasty,’ saidLindesay. Full results of Lindesay's find appears in China's March issue of National Geographic Magazine.","Discovered in Mongolia, it's the first time a part of the wall has been found outside China .

"A new study of the tectonic plates that make up Earth has revealed just how tempestuous the east Coast one was. Researchers say massive mountains rising between colliding plates, volcanoes belching lava and giant faults slicing the crust were found as the continent originally formed. Researchers even say an unusual magnetic signal near Florida shows the peninsula stuck to North America's heel like a piece of old tape about 300 million years ago, when the central and southern Appalachian mountains were built. The Brunswick Magnetic Anomaly is a geological feature that snakes from Alabama across Georgia, and offshore to North Carolina's Outer Banks. Anomalies in Earth's magnetic field are caused by structures such as faults, and by the varying magnetic intensities of different rock types - showing just how the continent was formed. For hundreds of millions of years, the southern continents of South America, Africa, Antarctica, Australia, and India were united in the supercontinent Gondwana. While the causes for Gondwana's fragmentation are still debated, it is clear that the supercontinent first split along along the East African coast in a western and eastern part before separation of South America from Africa took place. Today's continental margins along the South Atlantic ocean and the subsurface graben structure of the West African Rift system in the African continent, extending from Nigeria northwards to Libya, provide key insights on the processes that shaped present-day Africa and South America. In fact, the rocks beneath Florida suggest the peninsula originally wasn't part of North America at all. It's a fragment of either Africa or South America, sutured onto the southeastern United States near an unusual feature called the Brunswick Magnetic Anomaly, researchers say. 'The repeated cycles of plate tectonics that have led to collision and assembly of large supercontinents and their breakup and formation of new ocean basins have produced continents that are collages of bits and pieces of other continents,' researchers led by  Elias Parker Jr. of the University of Georgia wrote. In many cases, the rocks involved in these collision and pull-apart episodes are still buried deep beneath the Earth's surface, so geologists must use geophysical measurements to study these features. The new study by Elias Parker Jr. of the University of Georgia examines a prominent swath of lower-than-normal magnetism — known as the Brunswick Magnetic Anomaly — that stretches from Alabama through Georgia and off shore to the North Carolina coast. Parker has analyzed the detailed characteristics of the magnetic anomalies from data collected across zones in Georgia and concludes that the Brunswick Magnetic Anomaly has a deeply buried source. The anomalous magnetic signal is consistent with an older tectonic event — the Alleghanian orogeny that formed the Alleghany-Appalachian Mountains when the supercontinent of Pangea was assembled. Parker's main conclusion is that the rocks responsible for the Brunswick Magnetic Anomaly mark a major fault-zone that formed as portions of Africa and North America were sheared together roughly 300 million years ago — and that more extensive evidence for this collision are preserved along this zone. One interesting implication is that perhaps a larger portion of what is now Africa was left behind in the American southeast when Pangea later broke up - including Florida. How South America could have ruled the world: This image shows how the Earth MIGHT have looked if Africa had been split in two. The move would have left a huge ocean south of today's Sahara desert, creating a South Atlantic and a Saharan Atlantic Ocean . The huge upheavals occured millions of years ago when eastern North America was part of Gondwana and Pangaea, the supercontinents that formed as Earth's tectonic plates collided, split apart, and then crashed together again before rifting and drifting toward the spots where they're located today. Australian researchers say the break-up of the supercontinent Gondwana about 130 Million years ago could have lead to a completely different shape of the African and South American continent. They say the move would have left a huge ocean south of today’s Sahara desert, creating a South Atlantic and a Saharan Atlantic Ocean. Geoscientists from the University of Sydney and the GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences used sophisticated plate tectonic and three-dimensional numerical modelling to recreate the shift - but with a different twist. The researchers say the shift that left Africa it its present location was almost very different. 'Extension along the South Atlantic and West African rift systems was about to split the African-South American part of Gondwana North-South into nearly equal halves, generating a South Atlantic and a Saharan Atlantic Ocean', geoscientist Sascha Brune said. 'In a dramatic plate tectonic twist, however, a competing rift along the present-day Equatorial Atlantic margins, won over the West African rift, causing it to become extinct, avoiding the break-up of the African continent and the formation of a Saharan Atlantic ocean.' How the Earth looks today: Researchers say a minor change in the twist of a tectonic plate could have led to a very different Africa . The team say their study highlights the importance of rift orientation relative to extension direction as key factor deciding whether an ocean basin opens or an aborted rift basin forms in the continental interior. For hundreds of millions of years, the southern continents of South America, Africa, Antarctica, Australia, and India were united in the supercontinent Gondwana. While the causes for Gondwana's fragmentation are still debated, it is clear that the supercontinent first split along along the East African coast in a western and eastern part before separation of South America from Africa took place. Today's continental margins along the South Atlantic ocean and the subsurface graben structure of the West African Rift system in the African continent, extending from Nigeria northwards to Libya, provide key insights on the processes that shaped present-day Africa and South America. The South Atlantic part of this giant rift system evolved into an ocean basin, whereas its northern part along the West African Rift became stuck. The team say their complex numerical models gave a simple explanation: the larger the angle between rift trend and extensional direction, the more force is required to maintain a rift system. The West African rift featured a nearly orthogonal orientation with respect to westward extension which required distinctly more force than its ultimately successful Equatorial Atlantic opponent.","Break-up of the supercontinent Gondwana 130 Million years ago caused major tectonic upheaval .

"A legal battle has been sparked by plans to auction off the one of Oskar Schindler's original lists for £2million. An original version of the document, which saved some 1,200 European Jews from the Nazi gas chambers, has gone up for sale on the website of a U.S. memorabilia dealer. But Erika Rosenberg, an heiress of the Schindlers, says the historic document should be in a museum and is trying to block its sale. Historic: This image, taken from the dealer's website, shows a page from the list up for sale . Outrage: Erika Rosenberg, an heir of the Schindlers, says the list should be on display in a museum . Quoted in the Daily Mirror, she said: 'Oskar and Emilie died poor and they desired that these documents be displayed in museums. 'It is very sad to to see this list be commercialised for millions of dollars. 'This legal fight is not for money but for social justice.' Schindler's List, the inspiration for the 1993 film of the same name, was produced by German industrialists Oskar and Emilie Schindler. They gave jobs in their weapons factories to some 1,200 Jewish workers to save them from Nazi concentration camps. The website of Gary Zimet, the dealer who has arranged the sale, says the 'exceedingly rare' original copy of the list is 'the only one ever to be on the market'. The website claims that the list's 'ironclad' provenance stems from its links to the family of Yitzhak Stern, Schindler's Jewish accountant and co-conspirator. It is one of only four versions of the list known, it is claimed, with two housed in Yad Vashem, the holocaust museum in Jerusalem, Israel, and the only other in the U.S. Holocaust Museum. 'This version of the list (there are seven all told) is the penultimate, being 14 pages in length and listing 801 names, dated April 18, 1945,' the website says. 'A more poignant and historic World War 2 relic cannot be imagined. This is the opportunity of a lifetime to acquire an item of truly incredible magnitude.' Heroes: Oskar and Emilie Schindler died poor in Argentina after leaving their lives in Germany behind when the war ended . According to the Daily Mirror, a previous auction for the list was suspended in 2010 after a lawsuit was taken out by Ms Rosenberg, 60. The daughter of Germans who fled to Argentina in 1940, Ms Rosenberg met Emilie Schindler in Buenos Aires in 1990. When Mrs Schindler died childless in 2001, she chose Ms Rosenberg as one of five heiresses. Ms Rosenberg had sought to block the sale of the list on copyright grounds. She lost the legal battle, but now she and her lawyers are investigating the possibility of appealing to an international court.","U.S. memorabilia trader puts document in online sale .

"Bonus: Royal Bank of Scotland CEO Stephen Hester was given £1m by RBS chiefs, despite a catalogue of failures and his decision to axe 3,500 jobs . The boss of state-owned Royal Bank of Scotland was handed an annual bonus of nearly £1million yesterday. To widespread fury, the board of directors awarded Stephen Hester more than many ordinary workers earn in a lifetime. The bank insists it has shown restraint because its chief executive was ‘entitled’ to £1.5million. But David Ruffley, a senior Tory on the Treasury select committee, said: ‘Mr Hester is already paid a £1.2million basic salary, which seems to me generous given that the share price has fallen and RBS has failed to meet its lending targets set by the Chancellor. ‘It is therefore totally unacceptable that there should be a bonus of just under £1million for what in the rest of the private sector would be seen as sub-standard performance.’ John Mann, a Labour MP on the same committee, said: ‘It is a reward for failure. Giving him a bonus that just creeps under £1million is like sticking two fingers up at the taxpayer. The Government should have put their foot down and insisted that he gets nothing.’ The move comes just days after ministers announced a crackdown on executive pay and David Cameron said a seven-figure sum for Mr Hester would be unacceptable. The Prime Minister said rewards for failure made ‘people’s blood boil’ when – in the words of the Bank of England governor – hard-up Britons were suffering ‘a ferocious squeeze’. Mr Hester’s bonus is the first of many for staff at a bank in the process of laying off 3,500 employees. RBS’s share price, meanwhile, has slumped by 40 per cent, giving the taxpayer a paper loss of billions of pounds. Senior Government sources said they were satisfied Mr Hester’s bonus had been cut and insisted he had to be paid well or be lost to a better-paid job in the private sector. Angry: David Cameron said that the rewards for failure make people's 'blood boil' while Labour's John Mann said that the payment was like 'sticking two fingers up at the taxpayer' One source said: ‘We said it should be smaller than last year and we said it should be under £1million. It is. Last year, his bonus was £2.04million. A senior Treasury source said: ‘We said we wanted the bonus to be significantly less and they have bowed to that.’ Sir Philip Hampton, chairman of RBS, said the bonus was fair, adding: ‘A safer and more valuable RBS is in the interests of our customers, shareholders and the UK economy. ‘We are progressing well toward this goal under the leadership of Stephen Hester.’ Protest: A man wearing a 'fat cat' suit stands outside Royal Bank of Scotland in London, with a cigar yesterday as the bank met to decide on the bonus . However, the boss of Lloyds Banking Group, which is also partly nationalised, has turned down a bonus which could have been up to £2.4million. Antonio Horta-Osorio said his decision was triggered by ‘the tough financial circumstances that many people are facing’, as well as his two-month absence following a severe attack of insomnia. Mr Hester’s bonus will be paid entirely in shares, allocated over the next three years. He has been given 3.6million, worth a total of £996,000 last night. Mr Hester will be taxed on his bonus, although the exact size of the tax bill is unclear because there are many different structures a company can use to make a share-based bonus award. Last night, experts said the most likely option is that he will have to pay income tax, currently 50 per cent, when the shares are awarded to him over the next three years. Labour condemned the Government’s failure to get a better deal. Angela Eagle, shadow Commons leader, said: ‘The board of RBS is thinking of paying their chief executive in one day more than someone on average earnings would make in a lifetime. We have heard expressions of outrage from the Government benches but the question is: “What is it going to do about it?” Lord Oakeshott, a LibDem peer, said: ‘It is time to block the bonus which is a clear reward for his failure to lend. He should certainly not got a penny in bonus. Britain cannot grow when one of its biggest banks does not lend.’ David Fleming, national officer at the union Unite, said: ‘What planet do Stephen Hester and his banking chums live on?’ He said the bonus was ‘utterly disgusting and offensive to every working person across the country’. Sir Mervyn King, the Bank of England governor, has also voiced his disapproval of big bonuses at a time of financial hardship. In a speech this week, he said: ‘The tragedy of the financial crisis is that those who have suffered most have been those who bear no responsibility for it.’ Criticism: Sir Mervyn King said it would be wrong if rewards go to a small elite earlier this week, while Angela Eagle asked what the Government were doing about it in a speech in the Commons . He added it would be wrong ‘if rewards go disproportionately to a small elite, especially one which benefited from the support of taxpayers.’ Royal Bank of Scotland’s share price has fallen almost 40 per cent in the past 12 months to close at 27.67p last night. The bank fell slightly short of its target for lending to small firms under the government’s Project Merlin initiative to get credit flowing through the economy, . Critics argue the Merlin  goals are faulty as they measure banks’ ‘capacity’ to lend – the money they make available in theory. Small firms claim the banks have hiked up loan charges and fees, deterring businesses from taking up the funds. Under the terms of Merlin, RBS and the country’s other four biggest banks pledged to lend small and medium-sized firms £76billion in 2011. Between January and September, this should have seen them hand out £57billion – and they fell £1billion short. Lord Oakeshott said RBS, which is 83 per cent state owned following its bail-out in 2008, was ‘the worst culprit by far’ among the banks. RBS earlier this month announced a further 3,500 job losses in its investment banking operation, on top of 2,000 announced previously.The bank has shed around 30,000 staff in the past two years, 22,000 of them in the UK. Chris Leslie, Labour Treasury spokesman, said: ‘Nobody doubts that Stephen Hester has done some important things at RBS, but what this award shows is David Cameron’s promises about reining in excessive bonuses at state-owned banks or using shareholder power have proved to be utterly worthless. ‘Indeed, anyone who thinks it is acceptable to award a bonus of almost £1million on top of a basic salary of £1.2million in these tough times is desperately out of touch with millions of people who are struggling to make ends meet.’ But George Young, the Leader of the Commons, said: ‘The contract which entitles Mr Hester to a bonus was put in place by the last Labour government. ‘We have done something which they failed to do. We have limited cash bonuses to £2,000 at RBS and Lloyds. ‘We’ve already said the bonus pool at RBS and Lloyds will be lower and more transparent this year than last year.’","Banks claims it showed 'restraint' as Stephen Hester was entitled to £1.5m .

"Business taxes that have existed since Tudor times could be scrapped. Chancellor George Osborne will today put reform of despised business rates – and more cheap loans for small firms – at the centre of his plans to secure the recovery. In an unashamedly pro-enterprise Autumn Statement, the Chancellor will reveal that the tax on commercial property in the UK is to be reviewed, paving the way for a fundamental overhaul. Scroll down for video . Using his loaf: Chancellor George Osborne pictured during a visit to a bakery in Birmingham . Retailers have long been pushing for reform of rates – which have existed in various forms since 1601 – to ease the pressure on the high street. Sources suggest that moving away from a charge based on the rateable value of a commercial property to a modern alternative – such as a sales tax – is being considered. The smallest businesses could be exempted altogether. Critics of the system say that in the age of internet commerce, it is absurd that company taxes are based on the physical space they use. Business rates are often a firm’s third biggest outgoing, after wages and rent. The British Retail Consortium, the manufacturers’ organisation EEF, the CBI, the Federation of Small Businesses and the British Property Federation (BPF) have all urged the Chancellor, who has already slashed rates of corporation tax to improve the UK’s competitiveness, to make the business rates system ‘fit for purpose’. ‘Unlike every other tax in the UK, the business rates burden does not fluctuate with the economic cycle, meaning businesses have to pay the same regardless of economic conditions, and this, we argue, must change,’ said Liz Pearce, chief executive of the BPF. As well as announcing a review of business rates, to draw up reforms to be implemented in the 2016 Budget, Mr Osborne will announce an overhaul and extension of the Treasury and Bank of England’s flagship funding scheme for business. Mr Osborne holds a copy of the Autumn Statement during a meeting at 11 Downing St yesterday . The Funding For Lending scheme involves the Bank allowing commercial lenders to borrow funds from it cheaply, so that they can pass this on in the form of cheap loans to firms. The scheme was launched in 2012 with the aim of increasing bank lending by up to £70billion, and was initially available for both mortgage and business lending. Earlier this year, the Government changed the rules so cheap home loans were no longer supported, given the surging housing market. Today the Chancellor will announce another overhaul, ensuring that cash is targeted only at small and medium-sized firms, and extending the scheme, due to end in January, for another year. He will also pledge an extra £400million for the British Business Bank, which has so far supported 38,000 businesses. Mr Osborne will claim the two measures will unlock £1billion of new finance for small and medium-sized firms, and champion the role of business in building the recovery. ‘The Government’s long-term economic plan is working, with the Funding for Lending scheme playing a vital role in supporting the recovery,’ the Chancellor said. ‘Now that credit conditions for households and large businesses have improved, it is right that we focus the scheme’s firepower on small businesses, which are the lifeblood of our economy.’ In his final Autumn Statement before the General Election, Mr Osborne will tell MPs that Britain ‘faces a choice’. ‘Do we squander the economic security we have gained, go back to the disastrous decisions on spending and borrowing and welfare that got us into this mess? Or do we finish the job – and go on building the secure economy that works for everyone? I say: we stay the course.’ Mr Osborne has been forced to rule out traditional pre-election tax giveaways as experts say he will have to admit that wiping out the vast budget deficit will take longer than previously thought. Despite the setback, the Chancellor is expected to say he intends to enshrine in law a promise to wipe out the budget deficit, in a trap for Labour before the election. Hospices are to get VAT refunds worth millions of pounds a year. After a long campaign by the hospice movement, George Osborne will agree today that they should receive an annual grant to cover their VAT costs. Currently, NHS organisations are able to recover VAT on non-business supplies such as catering, laundry, staff training and vehicle and maintenance costs. But hospices do not enjoy the same advantages – meaning they are unfairly disadvantaged and face large VAT bills. Mr Osborne will say today that the VAT refund is expected to be worth £4million a year to the sector, though if it is more the bill will still covered. ‘Hospice charities provide vital support services for the NHS and its patients and we want to support their work,’ said a government source. Search and Rescue and air ambulance charities are to get VAT refunds and more government cash following lobbying by Prince William. In today’s Autumn Statement, the Chancellor will announce VAT breaks for the sector from April, alongside £7.5million extra support for air ambulances. The tax refunds will be worth £25million over five years. The Duke of Cambridge is said to have been angry at pressure on air-sea rescue services. As a helicopter pilot at RAF Valley in Anglesey, he has helped out with mountain rescue, Coastguard and air ambulance services. David Cameron revealed at Prime Minister’s Questions in 2011 that the Prince had urged him to do more to support the services, many of which are run by charities. Today’s measure will mean all 150 search and rescue and air ambulance charities will be able to apply for VAT refunds on all their search and rescue activities as of April 1. The Chancellor will call a vote on eradicating the underlying deficit – highlighting Ed Balls’s plan to borrow throughout the next parliament. He may also cut a new cap on overall welfare spending. Labour has promised to balance the books only on day-to-day spending, and carry on borrowing billions of pounds for housing and infrastructure projects. Mr Balls said last night: ‘David Cameron and George Osborne have now failed every test and broken every promise they made on the economy. ‘This cost-of-living crisis is why the Chancellor will have to admit he has broken his promise to balance the books by next year. A Labour Autumn Statement would set out a better and fairer plan to deliver a recovery that works for the many and not just a few.’","Autumn Statement reveals his plans to secure the economic recovery .

He said the figure for the last year of the Labor government was 1.9 per cent. Mr Hockey said while export volumes in the resources industry had been strong and production had picked up strongly, prices for iron ore and thermal coal had fallen dramatically in recent times. This reflected 'quite starkly' that the resources sector was switching from significant investment to significant production, he said.

"A top QC has lost a costly legal battle over the sale of a £3.6million country manor after pulling out of the deal when he discovered the property was riddled with dry rot and rising damp. Leading barrister William Griffiths QC and his wife Angela thought they had found their dream home when they viewed Laughton Manor in Lewes, East Sussex, in 2010. They exchanged contracts with owner Alan Hardy on April Fools' Day in 2011 but were hauled before the courts after refusing to pay for the property because they were concerned about rising damp, wet and dry rot and timber decay. They have now lost a lengthy legal battle in London's High Court and face a £385,000 bill after a judge ruled they had breached the contract by trying to rescind the agreement. William Griffiths QC and his wife Angela ( together left) have been successfully sued by Alan Hardy (right) after they pulled out of buying Laughton Manor in East Sussex for £3.6million after exchanging contracts . Mr and Mrs Griffiths had originally agreed to buy Laughton Manor, in East Sussex (pictured), for £3.6million, but later pulled out after receiving the results of a survey which said it was 'riddled with damp and dry rot' The issue began when Mr Griffiths, 66, an 'eminent' planning and property lawyer, and his wife exchanged contracts on the multi-million pound property with bricklaying tycoon Mr Hardy, 56, before seeking any professional advice on the mansion's condition. A survey later revealed evidence of penetrating and rising damp, as well as wet and dry rot and signs of timber decay, the High Court heard. In light of the survey, Mr and Mrs Griffiths, who had wanted a home in 'pristine' condition, refused to stump up the balance of a 10 per cent deposit. However, Mr Hardy and his wife, Juliet, responded by tearing up the contract and refusing to refund the £150,000 deposit the Griffiths had already paid. The couples ended up in court where Judge Amanda Tipples QC today handed a resounding victory to Mr and Mrs Hardy. The Griffiths not only forfeited their £150,000 deposit, but were ordered to pay Mr and Mrs Hardy £235,000 damages for breach of contract. The main reception room at Laughton Manor, which was built in the mid-19th Century by Sir James Duke Bart . Mr and Mrs Griffiths claimed that a survey revealed the 150-year-old property was badly affected by damp . In a final blow to the QC, Judge Tipples found that Mr Griffiths made a better advocate than a witness. Having appeared on his feet in court countless times, the barrister 'found it difficult to simply answer the question put'. He 'could not resist arguing his case' from the witness box, the judge said, before adding: 'I prefer the evidence of Mr Hardy to that of Mr Griffiths'. Mr Griffiths earlier told the court that he 'tended to leave these things to his wife'. However, he agreed that he was 'much keener' on Laughton Manor than she was. The couple insisted in court that they had been the victims of 'reckless misrepresentation'. The master bedroom in the £3.6million country manor, in East Sussex, which has a total of 30 rooms . The spacious kitchen of Laughton Manor (left) and the marbled floor as you enter the building (right) They claimed devout church-goer Mr Hardy and his 55-year-old wife had gravely misled them about the mansion's condition. They also complained that Mr and Mrs Hardy had made 'excessive and unreasonable demands'. The couple also said they had discovered to their 'horror' that a small but 'extremely significant' plot of land had been sold off from the grounds. However, Judge Tipples accepted Mr Hardy's 'careful' evidence that he had never had the house surveyed and was unaware of any damp problem. Exonerating the Hardys, the judge said they had an 'unconditional right' to cancel the contract when Mr and Mrs Griffiths failed to pay the balance of the deposit or complete on time. The Hardys were entitled to pocket the deposit, to re-sell the mansion to someone else and to sue the Griffiths for damages, she ruled. The house was on the market for £4.5million and Mr and Mrs Griffiths had agreed to buy it for £3.6million . The manor also boasts a helicopter pad (pictured) as well as gym, cinema, 12 acre garden and staff quarters . A surveyor's report indicated that there was 'extensive rising damp, dry rot and timber decay' in the property . Laughton Manor was originally built between 1760 and 1780 although it is unknown how much of the original building remains. It was bought by Sir James Duke Bart, a Lord Mayor and Sheriff of London in the 1840s. He was a close friend of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert and admired their summer residence of Osborne House, which also has a similar Italian style tower to Laughton Manor. The Duke's family lived in the property for more than 70 years and it was sold in 1911 to a private buyer. In 1930 it was bought by the Ministry of Health, who used it as an office until the 1990s. It was then bought over and restored to its former glory by a private owner. Jonathan Seitler QC, for Mr and Mrs Hardy, earlier pointed out that the contract contained a 'common' clause used in conveyancing, whereby the QC and his wife agreed to accept and pay for the property based on its state of repair at the time of signing. They had viewed the property several times, once with an architect, but had signed the contract on April 1, 2011, the day after agreeing the £3.6million price. They had done so without first obtaining a survey report, which did not arrive until a month later, the court heard. Mr Seitler added: 'The vendor is a lay person in matters of law...the purchaser is an eminent QC with property expertise. 'The property was accepted in the physical state it was in at the time of contract and you can't go back on that. 'If it is damp, it is accepted with damp'. The 30-room mansion is set in 12 acres of countryside and its architecture has been compared to that of Queen Victoria's much-loved summer home, Osborne House on the Isle of Wight. It was built by Queen Victoria's friend, Sir James Duke Bart, in the mid-19th Century. It is believed that Laughton Manor has since been sold to another purchaser for the same £3.6million price tag. Mr Hardy now lives in Lewes with his wife, manages a church, and has business interests valued at £17m.","William Griffiths QC and his wife exchanged contracts on Laughton Manor .

"Chancellor George Osborne has flown in the face of mounting rage at Royal Bank of Scotland's decision to award it boss a £1million bonus by claiming that it 'could have been worse for the taxpayer'. To widespread fury, the taxpayer-owned bank awarded its Chief Executive Stephen Hester a bonus worth £963,000, more than many ordinary workers earn in a lifetime. While the bank insists it has shown restraint - claiming its chief executive was 'entitled' to £1.5million - the decision has become a lightning rod for public disgust at the culture of rewards for failure. Bonus: Royal Bank of Scotland's Stephen Hester was given £1m, despite a catalogue of failures and his decision to axe 3,500 jobs, but the decision was defended by the Chancellor George Osborne, right . Clear criticism is raining down from all corner; Labour leader Ed Miliband; London Mayor Boris Johnson; Bank of England Governor Mervyn King; Lib Dem Foreign Office Minister Jeremy Browne, trade unions and taxpayers watchdogs. However, Osborne, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, came out in defence of the decision. He excused the Government of blame but then claimed the £1m award was value for the taxpayer. 'I’ve always said that levels of pay across banking and financial services are too high,' he said. 'But this pay for Stephen Hester - the bonus - was set by the board of RBS under the arrangements that were put in place by the previous government, and of course Stephen Hester was the person brought in to sort out the mess at RBS after it collapsed. 'I think the important point for people to understand is that the alternatives would have been worse for the taxpayer. 'Either there would have been a much larger bonus, of the kind he would have got a few years ago. 'Or the British Government would have had to take over complete ownership of RBS and over-ruled the board, and I think that would have cost the taxpayer more as well. Away days: Osborne's comments came while speaking at the World Economic Forum, which is taking place in the Swiss ski resort of Davos . 'I understand people’s frustration about levels of pay across the banking sector, but the alternatives, when it came to Stephen Hester’s bonus, would have been worse for the taxpayer.' RBS, which received a £45 billion state bailout, has seen its share price slump by 40 per cent, giving the taxpayer a paper loss of billions of pounds. Osborne's comments come just days after ministers announced a crackdown on executive pay and David Cameron said a seven-figure sum for Mr Hester would be unacceptable. The Prime Minister said rewards for failure made ‘people’s blood boil’ when – in the words of Mervyn King – hard-up Britons were suffering 'a ferocious squeeze'. But Cameron has been placed in a very difficult position, not just by Osborne's inflammatory comments, but also by criticism today which has come from within the coalition government. Speaking on BBC1's Question Time, Lib Dem Foreign Office minister Jeremy Browne said Hester had earned more in three days than a soldier serving on the frontline in Afghanistan would earn in a year. Angry: David Cameron said that the rewards for failure make people's 'blood boil' while Lib Dem minister Jeremy Browne, right said Hester had a duty to refuse the bonus, which is more than a soldier earns a year . ''I think he should reflect on that,' said Mr Browne. 'He . is working for a company which is five sixths owned by us, the . taxpayer, and I think he has to think like a public servant, not like . someone who's there to line their own pocket. 'He needs to think like a public servant who has a duty to his country, not just his own wealth.' 'No-one's forcing him to take this money. He could struggle on with £1.2m.' David Cameron is now facing pressure from within the coalition to back up his rhetoric with action. Labour leader Ed Miliband seized the opportunity today to pressure Cameron, saying that the pay award showed the Prime Minister had failed to live up to his rhetoric on executive pay and shareholder activism. 'It's a disgraceful failure of leadership by the Prime Minister,' he said. 'He’s been promising for months action against excessive bonuses, executive pay, and now he’s nodded through a million-pound bonus. Pressuring the PM: Ed Miliband, left, said the pay award was a clear failure of leadership from David Cameron while Boris Johnson said he was 'at a loss' to explain the size of the bonus . 'He’s also been lecturing shareholders about how they need to be more active in holding executives to account. 'He owns, through the British Government, 83% of the Royal Bank of Scotland. 'He must now explain, not least to the British people, why he has allowed this to happen.' London mayor Boris Johnson joined the condemnation, saying he was 'at a loss to justify' the scale of the payment. Protest: A man wearing a 'fat cat' suit stands outside Royal Bank of Scotland in London, with a cigar yesterday as the bank met to decide on the bonus . He said he had sympathy for Mr Hester and wanted an end to 'incessant banker-bashing'. But . he went on: 'I find it absolutely bewildering because RBS occupies the . same status in the economy as Gosbank did in the Soviet Union: it’s a . state-owned bank. 'The idea that this is not in the control of the Government seems to me to be far-fetched.' Protesters from civic campaign group . Avaaz are due to gather at the RBS headquarters in London later to call . for bonuses to be dropped. Trade union leaders have also vented . their anger at the size of the bonus, pointing out that millions of . public sector workers were facing a pay freeze and lower pensions as . well as job losses. David Fleming, Unite national officer, said: 'What planet does Stephen Hester and his banking chums live on? 'Taking almost £1 million from . taxpayers' pockets as a bonus is utterly disgusting and offensive to . every working person across the country. How can a Royal Bank of . Scotland senior banker who is responsible for sacking over 21,000 . workers be rewarded in this way?' TUC general secretary Brendan Barber . said: 'Ordinary people facing the biggest squeeze in their living . standards for decades and businesses desperate for credit will not . understand why Mr Hester should get such a huge bonus. 'The Government has been lecturing . public servants about how they must accept a pay freeze and a big . increase in pension contributions. They seem to have made an exception . for Britain's best paid civil servant.' Paul Kenny, general secretary of the . GMB union, said: 'A bonus of nearly a million pounds looks to ordinary . people like he has won the lottery - with a ticket they paid for.' David Hillman, spokesman for the . Robin Hood Tax campaign, said: 'Curbing Hester's bonus at state-owned . RBS is a small step in the right direction but nowhere near enough. Criticism: Sir Mervyn King said it would be wrong if rewards go to a small elite earlier this week, while TUC leader Brendan Barber said the Government's lectures on pay freezes clearly don't apply to Hester . It is believed any payout to Hester would be in shares rather than cash, and deferred for three years. Senior Government sources said they . were satisfied Mr Hester’s bonus, which was £2m last year, had been cut and insisted he had to be . paid well or be lost to a better-paid job in the private sector. Gary Greenwood, an analyst at Shore . Capital, agreed and argued that the real test of Hester's pay is how . much he could earn somewhere else. Sir Philip Hampton, chairman of RBS, . said the bonus was fair, adding: ‘A safer and more valuable RBS is in . the interests of our customers, shareholders and the UK economy. ‘We are progressing well toward this goal under the leadership of Stephen Hester.’ But Hester’s bonus is just the first of many for staff at a bank in the process of laying off 3,500 employees. The bank fell slightly short of its . target for lending to small firms under the government’s Project Merlin . initiative to get credit flowing through the economy, . Critics argue the Merlin goals are faulty as they measure banks’ ‘capacity’ to lend – the money they make available in theory. Small firms claim the banks have hiked up loan charges and fees, deterring businesses from taking up the funds. Under the terms of Merlin, RBS and . the country’s other four biggest banks pledged to lend small and . medium-sized firms £76billion in 2011. Between January and September, . this should have seen them hand out £57billion – and they fell £1billion . short. Lord Oakeshott said RBS, which is 83 . per cent state owned following its bail-out in 2008, was ‘the worst . culprit by far’ among the banks. RBS earlier this month announced a . further 3,500 job losses in its investment banking operation, on top of . 2,000 announced previously. The bank has shed around 30,000 staff in the . past two years, 22,000 of them in the UK.","Chancellor flies in the face of widespread anger over £1m bonus awarded to RBS boss Steven Hester .

"A U.S. congressman has been hailed a hero after saving the live of a passenger of a who had a suspected heart attack at during a flight. Raul Ruiz, who is a trained emergency room doctor, leapt into action when a man was taken ill midway through the journey from Washington DC to Dallas Fort Worth airport. Amazingly, another congressman, Pete Gallego, was also on the flight and helped resuscitate and stabilize the stricken man. Heroics: Raul Ruiz, left, used his medical training, with the help of fellow congressman Pete Gallego, right, to save the life of a passenger, thought to be in his 60s, who collapsed during a flight to Dallas Fort Worth . The Californian Democrat, 41, with the help of Mr Gallego, 51, used a defibrillator to restart the heart of the passenger, thought to be in his 60s, and give oxygen. 'I'm an emergency medicine physician by heart, and my spirit felt alive, I was in my element. I was providing emergency care to somebody who needed it at the time and it felt real good,' Ruiz told NBC 5 DFW after the plane landed in Dallas. As the mid-air drama unfolded on Thursday evening, Mr Gallego tweeted: 'Medical emergency on flight from DC to TX. Passenger collapses. @Congressmanruiz, an MD, on board. Passenger stabilized. Landing in Raleigh.'He added in another tweet: 'Hope @Congressmanruiz is on all my flights home! An emergency room Dr by training, was impressive to see him in action. He saves lives!' Drama: Pete Gallego took to twitter to tell followers of the mid-air life-saving efforts of fellow Congressman Raul Ruiz . The flight was diverted to nearby Raleigh airport where the ill passenger was taken to hospital. It is understood he was conscious and talking to medics when he was taken from the plane. Mr Ruiz is the latest congressman to intervene in a medical emergency. According to Politico website, in September 2011, Phil Roe, R-Tenn., an obstetrician by trade who served in the U.S. Army Medical Corps, helped revive a man who suffered a heart attack. He performed CPR and used a defibrillator to restart his heart at the Charlotte, N.C., airport. On Aug. 26, last year, Andy Harris, a Republican from Maryland, was able to revive a toddler who appeared to have stopped breathing during a seizure. In 1998, then-Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., a former heart and lung transplant surgeon, performed lifesaving measures on a gunman who was wounded after killing two on-duty Capitol Police officers.","Raul Ruiz used a defibrillator on the stricken man, thought to be in his 60s .

"At a cost of £222.5million each, damaging a Boeing 747-8 freight plane is certainly not advised. So it perhaps understandable that the crowds who gathered to watch this particular plane take off were a little shocked to see it rock dramatically from side to side as it left the runway. But rather than losing control of the aircraft, the pilot was actually performing a highly skilled manoeuvre known as a 'wing wave'. The pilot of the Boeing 747-8F freight plane prepares to perform a skilled manoeuvre known as a 'wing wave' The 'wing-wave', a gentle dip of the plane from one side to another, is generally done by cargo planes to say 'goodbye' as the aircraft will never again see the home airport where it was made. The move is also performed as a 'thank you' gesture to staff at the airbase. The footage, which has been uploaded to the ViralVideoUK website, shows the brand new Boeing jet performing the move as it takes of on its maiden voyage. Pilots usually wait until the aircraft has reached 2,000ft before attempting the stunt . The plane was departing from Paine Field airport in Washington, US . The plane was departing from Paine Field airport in Washington, US – the airfield which is home to the Boeing Everett Factory where the company's jets are assembled and made. Cargo planes generally only dip each wing when they have reached 2,000ft or higher and travelling at a sufficient speed. However, the captain of this plane, made by Boeing for Cargolux Airlines, decided to show off what the aircraft was capable of.

"Police have been accused of ignoring a whistleblower's warning about a paedophile care home boss - allowing him to carry on abusing boys for an extra ten years. John Allen was yesterday found guilty of committing historical sexual abuse against 18 boys and one girl aged between seven and 15 at his residential care home in Wrexham, north Wales. But today it has emerged that the finance officer at the care home, Des Frost, alerted police as long ago as 1980 after six youngsters complained about Allen's abuse. Police have been accused of ignoring a whistleblower's warning about paedophile care home boss, John Allen (pictured) - allowing him to carry on abusing boys for an extra ten years . Whistleblower: Des Frost (pictured) says he alerted police as long ago as 1980 after six youngsters complained about abuse at the hands of John Allen . Mr Frost said detectives visited him after he reported the matter, but that the claims were dismissed. Allen, now 73, continued to carry out abuse at the Bryn Alyn care home until the early 1990s - a decade later. Mr Frost, 75, told Walesonline.co.uk: 'My generation look on the police as very responsible people. I wrongly assumed they would do something about my report. 'I’m so disappointed nothing was done. If police had acted, 10 years of terrible sexual abuse could have been stopped. I thought they would challenge Allen about this. They didn’t.' Allen was told he must spend at least 11 years behind bars for committing 'grave' offences against children at the care home he ran in Wrexham. Mr Frost, a married father of four, accused police of  failing to prevent ten more years of abuse saying his report to police 'should have sounded alarm bells' because he was a senior member of staff at the home. Accountant Des Frost alerted police as long ago as 1980 after six youngsters complained about Allen's abuse  at the Bryn Alyn care home (pictured) John Allen pictured in 1971 with children at the Wrexham care home where he abused young boys and girls . John Allen (pictured) was told he must spend at least 11 years behind bars for committing 'grave' offences against children at the care home he ran in Wrexham . The accountant was living over the border in England when he said he told two detectives from Cheshire about his concerns that abuse was taking place and that he was told the allegations would be referred to the neighbouring force. Walesonline quotes Detective Chief Superintendent Wayne Jones, from North Wales Police, as saying: 'All material in relation to any allegations made during that period has been given to the Op Pallial team.' The website says neither force has been able to comment on any alleged wrongdoing. Cheshire Police said they were unable to find Mr Frost's report because it pre-dated computer records. A spokesman said that normal procedure would have meant they could presume the matter would have been passed to North Wales Police. The National Crime Agency says it has spoken to Mr Frost. Mold Crown Court heard how Allen's victims considered him 'untouchable' over decades of sustained abuse as they had no one to report his behaviour to while under his care. Yesterday, they hugged one another and their families after seeing the sex offender jailed, with one man telling how he felt as though his 'life sentence' had been lifted. Stephen Fong (centre) celebrates outside court after paedophile John Allen was jailed for life . Allen denied all offences during the six week trial to the shock of complainants present at the sentencing. He was given a discretionary life sentence for seven serious sexual assaults and received concurrent terms of 10 years for 23 indecent assaults. One count of gross indecency with a child brought a sentence of two years. He was cleared of two other serious sexual assaults. Allen had already spent six years in jail over abuse in the 1970s and avoided prosecution in 2003 over more alleged attacks when legal proceedings collapsed. In 1995, after Allen was jailed for the first time, an inquiry was launched to look at the abuse of children in Gwynedd and Clwyd areas. Following its publication in 2000, more complainants came forward with claims they had been abused by the 73-year-old. But the case was stunted by a Crown Court judge who reportedly ruled that Allen would not receive a fair trial because of the publicity about his previous convictions. In 2012 he was arrested amid fresh allegations and found guilty last week of 33 offences against young boys and one against a girl.","John Allen was jailed  for life yesterday over decades of sustained abuse .

"The rugby team of West Point military academy has been disbanded and players disciplined over an email chain involving crude sexual references and suggesting a ‘hostile team environment or a culture of disrespect towards women.’ Players on the rugby team of the elite New York institution—a veritable assembly line into the highest echelons of the American military—shared emails that have now been deemed to be in violation of the Cadet Disciplinary Code. Shared between the entire rugby team be several players, the emails reportedly contained rankings of a sexual nature of female cadets and other women, as well as references to rape, incest, and homosexuality. Marching orders: Elite military academy West Point's rugby team has been disbanded after an investigation found players had been exchanging lewd emails as part of a culture hostile to women . This, as reported by the Sunday Times June 2. The Times was also told by a former cadet who was privy to the emails ‘there were jokes about putting people in cages…while being leashed’ and that sexual references were made about a female cadet ‘eating a burrito.’ ‘The females were referred to as manly, disgusting, sluts and fat,’ said the source. U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel spoke at West Point last weekend during a ceremony in which 14 rugby team members were allowed to graduate. Inside jokes: The emails reportedly contained crude references to rape, incest, and homosexuality and referred to some women as 'manly' In his address, the secretary referred to sexual harassment as ‘debilitating, insidious, and destructive forces’ in the American military that ‘must be stamped out.’ A statement from school officials said the implicated cadets were made to complete a supervised ‘intense respect rehabilitation program’ involving self-assessments. Chief West Point spokesman Lt. Col. Webster Wright told the Army Times it is undetermined for how long the team will remain disbanded and that the investigation is ‘ongoing.’ ‘Despite doing some really silly, sophomoric things, they stood up and they accepted full responsibility for this as the leadership of the team. This was unprofessional conduct and not what we would expect from future leaders of the army,’ Webster said. Demotion: The disbanding is indefinite and the more senior players faced punishment as severe as loss of rank . In all, about 60 cadets were punished following the rugby team investigation. In addition to the rehabilitation program, Webster said punishment of the senior players included 120 hours of marching in uniform carrying rifles, demotion, and loss of leave. Though the controversy was not reported until far more recently, the West Point Rugby team’s official Facebook page has read ‘Due to unforeseen circumstances, the West Point Rugby team will not be participating in the 2013 CRC 7s tournament in Philadelphia’ since May 20.

"Colin Williams, 36, (pictured) of Swindon, has been jailed for three and a half years after pleading guilty to theft and fraud - he stole almost a quarter of a million pounds from his clients and employers . An accountant who fiddled his firm's books and stole more than £200,000 from his clients and employers has been jailed after pleading guilty to theft and fraud. Colin Williams, 36, of Russley Close, Peatmoor, in Swindon, treated himself to two or three luxury breaks a year with money he stole from the chartered accountants where he worked. He had not yet unpacked from his latest expensive holiday to Honolulu when police arrested him. Richard Williams, defending, said his client had lost everything as a result of his offending, as his wife and step children left him and he had lost his job and pension. He told Swindon Crown Court: 'He certainly hopes that the firm can survive. He stands before you extremely ashamed and publicly humiliated.' The court heard Williams, 36, was employed as a partner by chartered accountants SD Knee in Swindon, Wiltshire, but had lied about his credentials. He had told bosses he was a member of the Chartered Institute of Taxation. Williams fiddled the books and stole the fees paid to the firm, cash meant to pay the company's Corporation tax and stole money given to him by clients to go to the taxman. He also kept money meant for six colleagues' life insurance, which was part of their pay package. Williams was eventually caught when his boss, Simon Knee, noticed invoices for work he had already done himself. Williams produced doctored bank statements in an attempt to show it was a one-off, but Mr Knee found more discrepancies and called the police.

On his LinkedIn account Williams describes himself as an 'experienced UK tax professional'. His online CV, which still lists him as still working at S D Knee, states he was previously a tax consultant at PricewaterhouseCoopers. Williams goes on to claim he started his 'career in tax' in 1996 after completing a degree in Taxation and Revenue Law at Bournemouth University. His profile adds: 'After working for a mid tier independent firm for many years as a Manager, where he eventually became the Head of Tax Services, Colin was appointed Tax Partner at S D Knee Chartered Accountants in June 2007. Williams used the money to go on luxury holidays several times a year, including one to Hawaii (file picture) When police officers arrived at Williams' home he had not even unpacked his bags from a trip to Honolulu. He initially accepted taking just £34,000, but detectives uncovered more evidence and eventually discovered he stole a total of £218,025.87. Travel agents told investigators that Williams was taking two or three holidays each year. Williams pleaded guilty to three counts of theft and three of fraud. Judge Peter Blair jailed Williams for three and a half years and said: 'As you know, prison follows when people take money of this sort of quantity. 'That has been used on expenditure that has helped sustain a rather more lavish lifestyle than you would have been able to enjoy, particularly to luxuriant, expensive holidays that you were able to take.' Swindon Crown Court (pictured) heard Williams fiddled the books and stole the fees paid to the firm, cash meant to pay the company's Corporation tax and stole money given to him by clients to go to the taxman .","Colin Williams, 36, stole more than £200,000 over a three-year period .

"They are all iconic Manchester derby moments stripped down to their simplest form. These goals sent one half of the city into ecstasy and the other half into despair and now graphic designer Rick Hincks has re-told them in their mechanical, purest form with his latest collection of prints. After the success of his collection of minimalist World Cup prints, Manchester-based Hincks has released six new artworks ahead of Sunday's derby clash at the Etihad Stadium. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Wayne Rooney's famous Manchester derby overhead kick in 2011 has been immortalised like never before in a unique set of prints by graphic designed Rick Hincks .

Kompany leaps above the United defence to power home the winner and help City claim the title . The balance of power in the city has shifted in recent years, with City dominating recent Premier League encounters between the two old rivals. Having claimed two of the last three titles, United boss Louis van Gaal has an almighty task wresting back the power base from United's 'noisy neighbours.' But both clubs have enjoyed their share of glorious moments down the years and Hincks has recreated some of the most famous. They include Wayne Rooney's spectacular overhead kick in 2011, Roy Keane's winner to cap United's incredible comeback from two-down at Maine Road in 1993 and Andrei Kanchelskis' hat-trick goal in the 5-0 thrashing of City at Old Trafford in 1994.

Hincks, a City fan, said: ‘The idea to document football moments was just natural, it's great recreating those moments from peoples favourite team, the moments that get the hairs on the back of your neck going and that buzz of excitement in your stomach. It's why we love football.’ ‘Creating a Manchester derby collection was simply a must. There are so many memorable moments from each side, I couldn't just do one or two.

"Two friends who claim to have captured vision of an Australian Bigfoot say they 'convinced' the elusive creature to appear on film by offering him a feast of apples. The grainy early-morning video, shot in South Queensland on March 29, has sent an online community of Bigfoot hunters into a spin after the friends who filmed it claimed the clip is evidence of the mysterious Yowie - a mythical creature rumoured to roam the Aussie bush. Jason Heal and Jason Dunn, self-described 'Yowie searchers', posted the vision to their YouTube account on April 5 and dubbed the strange creature with glowing eyes 'The Morning Visitor'. Proof? Aussie mates Jason Heal and Jason Dunn say this is evidence of a Yowie in south Queensland . 'We'd been throwing him a few extra apples since he was willing to appear on camera,' Jason Heal told MailOnline. 'I'm somebody who believes in appreciation in life and if he's showing himself, we appreciate the fact. 'We even left a few apples without the camera and said ""you can have the apples but we don't get the prize.""' He said the Yowie first appeared the Thursday afternoon before their early morning video by waving its 'black hairy arm' in front of the lens 'to see if it's going to set the camera off or not'. Mystery male: The two friends are convinced the Yowie was a male . Mr Heal said he and his partner have spent thousands of dollars hunting Yowies in the Australian bush and described the furry humanoids as 'very intelligent creatures'. Their video has so far been watched more than 9,000 times. It is just the latest in a string of clips that have garnered the pair more than 1 million views on YouTube and inspired an article on the Cryptozoology News website. 'Even though the creature on the video certainly resembles a sloth, these animals are not native to any region of Australia and they are illegal to have as pets,' the article reads. Fruit lover: The two Jasons claim they lured the creature onto camera with a bunch of apples . 'The possibility of the video showing a big unidentified ape remains open.' But readers are not so sure with many voicing their skepticism over the infrared vision, filmed at 3:27am. 'That’s a really neat-o mask that guy is wearing!' said Ira Shlamazel. 'Maybe if you moved the camera a little further away it wouldn’t be so obvious.' User The Flinx joked: '1990 called, they want their hoax back'. Michael Bachman, editor of Cryptozoology News, told MailOnline: 'At this point we have no idea whether the video is real or a hoax, but it has certainly captivated some viewers.' Passion: Jason Heal (left) and Jason Dunn say they would hunt Yowies 'full-time' if they could afford it . The mixed opinion has angered the two Jasons who said they have invested time and money in their hunt for evidence of Australia's answer to the Sasquatch. 'Everyone's going crazy, saying it's a hoax, like we're putting lamps on our head,' said Mr Heal. 'You give them something real and they all turn around and say it's fake...we know they exist, we've done enough research.' The duo do have a number of fans online. Paul Davies wrote: 'Excellent capture you guys fair play, all that time out in the bush has certainly paid off.' Yowies have long been part of Australian folklore, with rumoured sightings dating back to the 18th century. Internet sleuths often swap tales of encounters with the strange ape-like creatures who are said to stroll around the outback.

"A species of African rhino last seen in 2006 is now officially extinct, according to the world's largest conservation network. The latest review of animals and plants by the International Union for Conservation of Nature found the Western Black rhino has been totally wiped out. Conservationists have blamed poachers and lack of conservation while warning that other rhinos could follow. A black rhino calf born at the Saint Louis Zoo in Saint Louis, Missouri. The IUCF said that the Western Black Rhino of Africa, a species related to these black rhinos, is officially extinct . According to the IUCN, Africa's Northern White rhino is 'teetering on the brink of extinction' while Asia's Javan rhino is 'making its last stand' The subspecies of the Black rhino - which is classified as 'critically endangered' by the International Union for Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species - was last seen in western Africa in 2006, CNN reported. Simon Stuart, chairman of the IUCN species survival commission, said: 'In the case of the western black rhino and the northern white rhino the situation could have had very different results if the suggested conservation measures had been implemented.' 'These measures must be strengthened now, specifically managing habitats in order to improve performance, preventing other rhinos from fading into extinction,' Mr Stuart added. The Western Black rhino was a rare subspecias of the Black rhino, and . was heavily hunted in the beginning of the 20th century. The . population rose again in the 1930s, after preservation actions were . taken, but a decline in protection efforts led to a decline in numbers. A Javan rhino captured on camera in Vietnam's Cat Tien National Park, the last Javan rhinoceros in Vietnam was found dead in the park in April 2010 . By 1980 the population was estimated in the hundreds and, by 2000, an estimated 10 survived. In 2006 a survey of the last remaining habitat failed to find any specimens. Poaching, . limited anti-poaching efforts and a failure of courts to hand down . severe sentences to punish poachers are all blamed for the Western Black . rhino's demise. Only 40 to 60 Javan rhinos now remain in . Ujung Kulon National Park in Indonesia. They are the last known living . members of the species, with none in captivity. The Northern White rhino, which is 'teetering on the brink of extinction', according to the ICUN . Vietnam's Javan rhino population had . been shrinking for decades as land conversion and a rising local . population threatened the animal's habitat. The IUCN says conservation efforts have paid off for the southern white rhino subspecies which have seen populations rise from less than 100 at the end of the 19th century to an estimated wild population of 20,000 today. Another success can be seen with the Przewalski's Horse which was listed as 'extinct in the wild' in 1996 but now, thanks to a captive breeding program, has an estimated population of 300. The latest update to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species reviews more than 60,000 species, concluding that 25 per cent of mammals on the list are at risk of extinction. Many plants are also under threat, say the IUCN. Populations of Chinese fir, a conifer which was once widespread throughout China and Vietnam, is being threatened by the expansion of intensive agriculture according to the IUCN. A type of yew tree (taxus contorta) found in Asia which is used to produce Taxol (a chemotherapy drug) has been reclassified from 'vulnerable' to 'endangered' on the IUCN Red List, as has the Coco de Mer -- a palm tree found in the Seychelles islands -- which is at risk from fires and illegal harvesting of its kernels. Recent studies of 79 tropical plants in the Indian Ocean archipelago revealed that more than three quarters of them were at risk of extinction. In the oceans, the IUCN reports that five out of eight tuna species are now 'threatened' or 'near threatened,' while 26 recently-discovered amphibians have been added to the Red List including the 'blessed poison frog' (classified as vulnerable) while the 'summers' poison frog' is endangered. 'This update offers both good and bad news on the status of many species around the world,' Jane Smart, director of IUCN's global species program said in a statement. 'We have the knowledge that conservation works if executed in a timely manner, yet, without strong political will in combination with targeted efforts and resources, the wonders of nature and the services it provides can be lost forever.'","Survey by International Union for Conservation of Nature finds none left .

"Sometimes the most ambitiously creative projects can deliver the most awe-inspiring results. Ukrainian indie band Brunettes Shoot Blondes said they wanted to produce an animation to compliment their simple track Knock Knock and they produced an innovative video to achieve this. The group produced a simple animation across at least 16 Apple devices which was anything but simple to complete. Protagonists: The two protagonists in the unique animation video are a man with a rabbit head and a woman . Focusing on two characters, the spectacular video shows them crossing between a multitude of Apple devices to tell a love story. Speaking about the number of required takes to capture the footage Brunettes Shoot Blondes said it 'took dozens and then add 50'. They have produced a mesmeric animation which features a man with a rabbits head chasing the woman of his dreams through an array of Apple devices. Chase: The man runs after the female continuously throughout the amusing video . The talented group used eight iPhones, five iPads, some iPod shuffles and two Macs to produce and bring the compelling animation to life. The humorous and highly original video was shot on an iPhone. 'We had an idea of graphic elements that would interplay between the gadgets,' band member Andrew Kovaliov told Dezeen. 'So then we created the characters and started to work on synchronisation of the video fragments downloaded on different devices.' Animation through devices: The characters move through a myriad of Apple devices during the animation . Stairs: The female character runs down a set of stairs while the man-rabbit character chases her . Following the story of a man chasing his lover through a series of different scenes to try and catch up with her, the animation sees the two characters start off on separate iPhones. They then progress onto iPads, passing through an iShuffle on the way and move on to the two Macs. As the song reaches its conclusion, the two lovers finally meet on the same screen. Car: The unfortunate man-rabbit finds it extremely difficult to keep up with the female character . Happy conclusion: At the end of the video the female character drops into the man's arms . This was created as a music video for a song by Ukrainian band Brunettes Shoot Blondes. You can see more of their work on Soundcloud https://soundcloud.com/brunettesshootblondes .

"He's the man made rich by meerkats, and this is how he's chosen to spend (some of) it. Entrepreneur Douw Steyn, 62, who owns the ComparetheMarket insurance website and is worth £600million thanks to the meerkat adverts, has built himself a vast palace in his native South Africa. The modestly named Palazzo Steyn, currently being built on a 2,000-acre estate between Johannesburg and Pretoria, is surrounded by a ruined aqueduct from which water plunges into a lake below. Scroll down for video . Palazzo Steyn, built for ComparetheMarket entrepreneur Douw Steyn, 62, is in an estate outside Johannesburg . Looking more like a ballroom than a garage, this marble-lined basement is for Mr Steyn's collection of cars . Douw Steyn, 62, started his insurance firm in Peterborough, Lincolnshire, in 1992, and its fortunes soared thanks to the meerkat ads which made the animal's catchphrase, 'Simples', a national phenomenon . With seven bedrooms suites, a wine cellar, and a cavernous marble-floored garage with room for 33 cars, Palazzo Steyn is South Africa's biggest house, dwarfing the sprawling home in KwaZulu-Natal province of the country's President, Jacob Zuma. There's also a large swimming pool, two fire pools, and extensive walled gardens laid to lawn at the house, which is also South Africa's most expensive, having cost around £14million to build. When asked about the size of the underground garage, the businessman, who is married to charity worker Carolyn, said: 'My home has a basement area that will house my car collection of sport and vintage models. 'This is one of my hobbies and the architects were briefed to design a showroom where the cars can be easily displayed and manoeuvred.' Mr Steyn's house lies at the centre of what he hopes will become Steyn City, a luxury country 'lifestyle estate'. The multi-millionaire, who two years ago bought a ten-bedroom, £62million mansion in London's Belgravia, wants to build 11,000 homes, private hospital, two private schools, shops and office parks, alongside woodland and a 26-mile running track around it. The businessman said he designed the estate based on the idea that 'too much time is wasted in cities sitting in traffic and commuting between home, work, schools and the shops'. Speaking on his Steyn City website, he said: 'I could have invested in a luxury residence in Europe or in the States, but instead I chose to invest in South Africa. This is indicative of the confidence I have in our country and the success of Steyn City. Original style: The house is surrounded by a circular aqueduct from which water plunges into a man-made lake . Carolyn and Douw Steyn, pictured at their wedding in Johannesburg last year, were friends of Nelson Mandela . Palazzo Steyn will be the centrepiece of his brainchild, the 11,000-home Steyn City - a luxury 'lifestyle estate' The London pad: Mr Steyn bought himself this ten-bedroom house in Belgravia two years ago for £62million . How the money was made: The success of the meerkat TV adverts meant that Mr Steyn's fortunes doubled . 'I also long for the quality of life that we are creating for future residents and it therefore made sense for me to be a part of it... My wife and I are looking forward to entertaining our friends and business partners from all over the world at our new residence, while also exposing them to our magnificent country.' The estate, which at 900 acres will be nearly five times the size of Monaco, will be 50per cent developed and 50per cent woodland, with pedestrian walkways and cycle and running tracks looping through and around it. Mr Steyn is said to be passionate about the idea that the car ruins environments for people - instead he wants children in Steyn City to grow up playing outside without danger of being run over. There is also a Nicklaus Design 18-hole championship golf course being built on the estate, with completion scheduled for next year, when the homes in Steyn City will first go on the market. It will be open to residents and their guests, and is being built around canyons and an old quarry. This picture shows the fourth hole on the Steyn City Golf Course, which is currently being built for residents . The Steyn City golf course clubhouse will feature a 'growing roof' planted with vegetation to help it blend in . Mr Steyn, who owns the upmarket Saxon Hotel in Johannesburg, and the Shambala Private Game Reserve in Limpopo, was a close friend of Nelson Mandela, whose widow attended the Steyn wedding last year. It was to Mr Steyn's Johannesburg home that Mandela went after he was freed from jail in 1990, and it was there, in the entrepreneur's home in the smart suburb of Sandhurst, that Mandela finished his autobiography Long Walk To Freedom. The South African insurance boss owes much of his success and wealth to the fictional chief meerkat, Aleksandr Orlov, who spoke in a fake Russian accent and made his 'Simples' catchphrase a national phenomenon. Worth £200million when the meerkat adverts first hit British screens in 2009, his wealth has since more than doubled - impressive for an insurance firm started in Peterborough in 1992. The entrepreneur was born in Johannesburg and attended university before moving to Britain in 1992 and setting up BGL, parent company of ComparetheMarket. By 2009 he was worth an estimated £200million, and a year later it had grown to £320million, since when it has grown yet again. Meanwhile, the company’s value has more than doubled from £43million in 2008 to £88million, thanks to the meerkats, while BGL employs 2,400 people at its Cambridgeshire HQ plus offices in Sunderland and Coventry.","Douw Steyn, 62, is the South African entrepreneur who set up insurance firm ComparetheMarket in Peterborough .

"A pilot on Russian national airline Aeroflot branded Ukrainians 'filth' in a cockpit message while flying over the country and is a racist homophobe who calls them 'scum' and 'killers' on his open social media websites. In a series of sickening posts, Oleg Bugaev, 30, repeatedly uses offensive terms to describe the people of the Ukraine, jokes about the MH17 tragedy and a helicopter being shot down. The posts have come to light as tension between the two countries remains high after Russia annexed the southern Crimea peninsula in March and continues to back rebels in eastern Ukraine. Russian Aeroflot pilot Oleg Bugaev claims he was misquoted when he was accused of calling Ukrainians filth during an August flight from Moscow to Vienna . On his open social media websites Bugaev repeatedly refers to Ukrainians as filth, Nazis and scum. He also makes light of the MH17 Malaysian Airlines tragedy which killed 298 people when it was shot down over Ukraine . Bugaev's 'filth' outburst stunned passengers on a scheduled passenger flight from Moscow to Vienna in August, which was tweeted by Slovakian diplomat Martin Kaco. Kaco wrote: ''En route by Aeroflot to VIE, captain to passengers: 'We fly over remnants of Ukraine, where Banderovtsi and other filth lives.'' The pilot's words referred to Stepan Bandera, seen as a fascist by many Russians for colluding with Nazi Germany but a hero by many Ukrainians for seeking an independent state not controlled by Moscow. Aeroflot did not apologise for the outburst but five days after Kaco's original complaint, they tweeted a reply. 'We've studied your message,' they wrote. 'The fact was confirmed. The pilot had no right to express his personal opinion while on duty... In this case the pilot has violated our internal regulations. We have started the internal investigation.' Supporting Russian separatists Bugaev wrote: 'Ukrainian invaders, go away from Russian land' With a delicately placed Nazi swastika, Bugaev posted a cartoon alongside the caption: 'Donetsk is not Kiev' Bugaev expressed his support for Russian leader Vladimir Putin in yet another anti-Ukrainian post on his social media site . But they have repeatedly declined MailOnline requests to reveal the outcome or whether Bugaev was grounded or disciplined. Using an online forum for flight crew Bugaev, who has been flying with Aeroflot since 2007, confessed that he was wrong to make the comments but claimed that he had been misquoted. 'I am that very captain who allegedly abused the Ukrainian people,' he wrote 'My words were flipped 180 degrees. Abuse was added to them and even words I do not know. He added: 'I have discussed it with the management. Of course, I confess it that I was wrong. I violated Aeroflot's standards by having added that we were flying over the remnants of Ukraine.' But his seemingly contrite words do not match the vitriol on his own social media account on which he repeatedly uses the word 'filth' to describe Ukrainians. Next to a picture of an empty grave, Bugaev who is married to 27-year-old Tatiana with whom he has a two-year-old daughter, wrote: 'The only way Bandera filth can get the lands of the south east (Ukraine).' Bugaev wrote: 'Nobody has ever put Donbass on its knees and no one will do' Referencing Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko, who made his fortune in the confectionery business, Bugaev calls him a 'chocolate gay' On another of his hate filled diatribes he declared: 'Bandera scum you are not my brother', while next to a picture of a man with a noose he wrote: 'Pray, Bandera, bastard.' In another post the pilot declares ""No place for Nazis on our land"" showing a map of Novorossiya that imagines Ukraine as a rump landlocked state totally cut off from access to the Azov and Black seas. He also branded Baroness Ashton - the former EU foreign affairs chief - as 'Eurohorse' while another image declared: 'EuroNazis will not pass'. Apparently alluding to Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko who made his fortune in chocolate, he wrote: 'Chocolate gay get off Donbass.' Bugaev with his wife Tatiana, 27. They have a two-year-old daughter together . A picture of a Russian boot kicking out Ukrainians from the east of their country is captioned: 'Invaders go home.' Making light of the Malaysian Airlines MH17 tragedy which killed 298 people, including 10 Britons, he blames the Ukrainian forces for the tragedy. 'The tradition of the Ukrainian army is to hit a plane once every 13 years,' he stated flippantly. Both pro-Russian separatists and the Ukraine have blamed each other for the tragedy. Alongside his tirades  also posted pictures showing him on foreign trips in Germany, Dubai, Hurgada, and Luanda in Nigeria. Seeking to explain his anger towards Ukrainians, on the flight crew forum he said was raised in 'beautiful' Lugansk, a region now substantially separatist hands, less than 50 miles from the Russian border. 'My house in Lugansk where I spent all my childhood with my parents was destroyed by Grad artillery,' he wrote. 'At the end of July I took my relatives away from Lugansk - two women with a small child, they live with me now and are still recovering. Their husbands stayed there in the (separatist) self-defence, to protect their land and houses.' He added: 'At the border with Novorossiya, in Donetsk town of Rostov region, I met people who were on the run, and I have never seen so much human suffering. These people have lost all they had at once but still they were happy to get out of the hell and to be alive.' Accepting he went too far in his flight deck remarks, he thanks other pilots 'for your support' adding: 'I am so pleased to experience our Slavic nation getting together'. He claimed: 'I was stupid to blurt out too much, but I abused nobody.'","Oleg Bulaev said his outburst was wrong during the August flight .

"You’ve seen images of Earth from the ISS, but one astronaut has set the bar to a new height with his shots of storms taken from above. Esa has released stunning pictures and video of lightning captured by a Dutch astronaut while on the International Space Station 255 miles (410km) above Earth. And one image makes Earth look more like a toy than a planet - as the landscape of Earth is revealed around a huge flash of lightning. Esa has revealed an amazing video of 49 images stitched together showing lightning strikes over Eastern Romania. The images were taken by Dutch astronaut André Kuipers in 2012 but have only just been released . The incredible series of images were captured by astronaut André Kuipers on the ISS on 11 June 2012, during Expedition 31. The lightning was captured over Eastern Romania at about 8:55pm UTC, and a video was made by stitching together 49 images taken on the ISS while travelling at 27,600 km/h (17,100 mph). Estimates suggest that 100 discharges can occur between the system of clouds and the surface of Earth each second, causing many lightning strikes, so for astronauts seeing such a sight is not all too rare. As the clouds are so vast, however, they are not always visible from the surface. But from the ISS the lightning is much more visible - and when astronauts orbit Earth, they can often spot lightning in clouds from above. As Esa explains, though, capturing images from the ISS at a height of 255 miles (410km) can be difficult. ‘At these distances a camera flash is pointless to take night-time images of Earth, but our planet moves by so quickly images can end up being blurred,’ they said. To help astronauts take images, they use something called a Nightpod camera. This uses a tripod system and is installed in the Cupola module of the ISS. Astronauts can then move it using motors to point at different locations on Earth. When the camera is pointed at a target on Earth, it will automatically compensate for the movement of the station, ensuring the image remains steady and clear. Nightpod actually flew with Kuipers to the ISS when he launched in December 2011, making him one of the first astronauts that got to use it on the ISS. Kuipers mission at the time was also especially notable, because in May he welcomed the first ever private spacecraft to the ISS - SpaceX’s Dragon. He was actually responsible for berthing the vehicle to the ISS at the time - the first person in history to dock a private spacecraft. While seeing lightning from Earth is somewhat rare, from space many more strikes can be seen. This image shows the entirety of Earth looking like a toy (pictured) as the lightning-filled cloud is spotted below. To the top left is the light of the sun in Earth's atmosphere . The images were taken using the Nightpod camera - illustrated left - which automatically matches the station's movement to reduce blur. Dutch astronaut Kuipers is pictured right on the ISS with the camera in 2012 . These latest pictures follow amazing images of lighting in the eye of a cyclone revealed earlier this week, also captured by an astronaut on the ISS. The incredible views of tropical cyclone Bansi were spotted in the Indian Ocean near the island of Mauritius, when the ISS was east of Madagascar. In the images the calm ‘eye’ of the storm can be seen illuminated by lightning and surrounded by swirling  clouds as it made its way across the ocean. They were taken by Italian European Space Agency astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti aboard the ISS earlier this month. An Italian astronaut on the ISS captured images of a cyclone on Earth. Tropical cyclone Bansi was spotted in the Indian Ocean by Esa's Samantha Cristoforetti while the ISS was east of Madagascar. The images show flashes of lighting illuminating the eye of the storm (shown) as the astronauts passed overhead . Tropical cyclones are low pressure systems that develop in the tropics in the Southern Hemisphere. They produce gale force winds of about 39mph (63km/h) on average and rotate in a clockwise direction. If the winds reach 73mph (118km/h), the system is called a severe tropical cyclone. The strongest winds are always near the eye, but damaging winds can extend hundreds of kilometres from the cyclone’s centre. Cyclones form in warm oceans when sea-surface temperature exceeds 26.5C and there are favourable wind conditions. They can persist for several days but lose their energy when they move over land or colder oceans, or are disrupted by other wind. They show the swirling motion of the storm around the central blue eye. According to Nasa, the wall of the eye is being illuminated by a flash of lightning in the centre of the storm - which also lights up nearby clouds. The low-light settings of the camera used to take the image accentuate the contrast. ‘It looks like the storm is powering up some sort of weapon!’ said Phil Plate at Slate.

"We've all been there, you try on a ring and go to remove it only to find that it won't budge. Or Maybe your fingers swell, whatever the reason - a stuck ring can cause panic. You're tugging and tugging and your finger is getting bluer and bluer and before you know it you're reaching for the margerine. Well put that butter down! There is a new solution to avoid this rather sticky (not to mention slimy) situation and all you need is a piece of string. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . The simple trick involves using just a pair of pliers and a piece of string, beginning by securing the string under the ring . A video that hit Facebook this week solves the age old problem of removing a ring that has become stuck on a finger with a clean and simple method. In the video a man helps someone remove their ring using only pliers and a piece of string with a clever trick that involves creating a spiral of string for the ring to unwind on. The man begins by using the pliers to get underneath the tight ring and push the string through it so it sits underneath. In the video the man winds the string up the finger in a tight coil (left.) Once he reaches the centre of the finger he tucks the loose end of string under the coil (right) He then continues by twisting the string around the finger towards the tip in a tight spiral until the string forms a tight coil from the base to the centre of the finger. He then firmly secures the string at the centre of the finger by tucking the loose end under one of the folds of string. Then returning to the base of the finger, the man takes the start of the string and simply unwinds the tightly wound coil that has been secured to the ring, bringing it clean off the finger. The video has already received 4,795 shares and 8,098 likes on Facebook and it is no surprise what with many of us resorting visiting A&E to have precious rings cut off. This neat trick has had thorough praise from it's viewers with 278 comments recommending the video. The string is then unwound from the finger starting from the base,  the ring will then come clean off the finger .","Incredible new video shows you a simple trick to remove a ring .

"Spanking and caning are among acts banned from online porn videos filmed in the UK, the Government has said. A list of sex acts, some featured in the erotic novel Fifty Shades of Grey, are now on a list of 'harmful' content that has been prohibited. A quiet change in legislation has ruled that paid-for online porn videos must now adhere to the same rules as content produced for sex shop-type videos. Scroll down for video . A number of 'Fifty Shades of Grey' style sex acts have been banned from online porn made in the UK. A movie based on the erotic novel is currently being made staring Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson (pictured) The erotic novel by E L James features spanking and caning . It means acts that would not be classified as an R18 rating, in line with guidelines laid out by the British Board of Film Censors (BBFC), are prohibited. The list of around 10 acts reportedly range from spanking to strangulation. Critics argue the change not only damages the country's porn industry, with online viewers still able to access content banned in the UK by watching videos filmed abroad, but amounts to 'arbitrary censorship'. Jerry Barnett, founder of anti-censorship campaign Sex And Censorship, told Vice: 'R18 is a strange thing. 'It's a set of weird and arbitrary censorship rules decided between the BBFC, the police and the CPS (Crown Prosecution Service). 'There appear to be no rational explanations for most of the R18 rules - they're simply a set of moral judgments designed by people who have struggled endlessly to stop the British people from watching pornography.' Spanking and whipping, which are featured in the saucy novel Fifty Shades of Grey, are on the banned list, as well as: . Aggressive whipping . Physical or verbal abuse (regardless of if consensual) Strangulation . The Audiovisual Media Services Regulation 2014 came in to effect on Monday. A spokesman for the Department of Culture, Media and Sport said: 'The legislation provides the same level of protection to the online world that exists on the high street in relation to the sale of physical DVDs. 'In a converging media world these provisions must be coherent and the BBFC classification regime is a tried and tested system of what content is regarded as harmful for minors.' Others have criticised the new legislation for cutting back on acts associated with women's pleasure. Erotic film director Erika Lust told the Independent: 'With this legislation, the UK is in danger of finding itself back in an age where porn is simply the boring, unrealistic, male fantasy of bimbos eagerly pleasing men as if it is their duty, where women are submissive and lack ownership of their sexuality. 'Women in the industry will now fear the loss of their livelihoods as well as their sexual independence.'","Spanking and caning among acts banned in paid for porn made in UK .

"With Halloween just weeks away, parents across the country will be no doubt planning to turn a pumpkin or two into Jack O'Lantern to scare would-be trick-or-treaters. But anyone wanting to use this particular vegetable for their frightful plans may want to start carving now. The giant vegetable stands one metre high and weighs more than 1,100lbs. Ian and Stuart Paton, 51, who grow flowers for a living, have nurtured . the gigantic vegetable for the past six months in their bid to grow the . largest one for miles around. Toddler Bailey Martin is dwarfed by the giant pumpkin, which weighs 1,100lbs . Ian, from Pennington, Hampshire, has been growing pumpkins - which are part of the squash family - for 40 years and currently holds the national record for a 1,300lbs specimen. The gardener has been hard at work all year to overcome the poor weather conditions in his attempt to retain the winning title at the Jubilee Sailing Trust’s pumpkin festival next month. He said: 'This year was not very good because of the weather. We got three good pumpkins after planting out six. 'That’s really important. But there are a couple of other good growers around that we need to watch out for.' 'Our secret is just very good feeds and keeping them topped up with a balanced diet of waters and fertilisers. Ambition: The growers hope to break the world record next year . Toddler Bailey Martin, one, was pictured having fun climbing over the gigantic gourd - which sits at a staggering one metre high - at their nursery near Lymington, Hampshire. The record for the world's heaviest pumpkin has been shattered twice in the US in the past five days. On Sunday, organisers at the Topsfield Fair in Rhode Island said Ron Wallace of Greene, Rhode Island, had broken the world record with a pumpkin weighing in at 2,009lbs. Just a few days earlier, on Thursday last week, a pumpkin grown by Steve Geddes of Boscawen, New Hampshire, weighed in at 1,843.50lbs. Organisers at the Deerfield Fair in New Hampshire claimed then that Geddes' gourd had broken the world record. Despite this year's poor weather, Mr Paton has stated his determination to beat the world record next year. He added: 'We’re going to put the flowers under a shade and put buckets of ice with the plants to keep them nice and cool. 'Because we grow flowers for a living, we have a bit of an advantage. 'We’re definitely going to go after that world record next year - we want to be remembered in the books. 'It’s a costly hobby, keeping a 650sq foot greenhouse going, but its worth it to see the kids’ faces at the show.' The brothers will be using a small truck and a forklift to carry the pumpkin, plus its 800lbs and 900lbs neighbours, to the show. In previous years, pumpkins have been carved into miniature boats with motors and massive jack-o-lanterns. The pair have said that all money raised will go straight to charity. Some of the UK's most super-sized vegetables are showcased every year at the UK National Giant Vegetables Championships. The monster veg can be so gigantic that forklift trucks are used to move them into display. A new world-record breaking 18.5ft parsnip was one of more than 200 vegetables unveiled at the competition in the Somerset town of Shepton Mallet last month. The . root vegetable is an eye-popping 36 times bigger than the standard . parsnip and was lovingly grown by Peter Glazebrook, 68, from Newark, . Nottinghamshire. The retired chartered surveyor has previously held the world record for a 8lbs 40oz potato. He has also been the double Guinness World Record holder for the heaviest parsnip, at 13lb, and the longest beetroot, at 21ft. The veteran grower's record-busting reputation is rivalled by Joe Atherton, 56, from Mansfield Woodhouse, Nottinghamshire. He snapped up the world record for the longest carrot, which he grew to an enormous 19ft 2inches in 2007. He also held the world record for the heaviest leek, at 6.6kg, in 2001.","The pumpkin was grown by twins Ian and Stuart Paton .

"A New Zealand woman who woke up to a horrendous smell and suspicious brown splodges on her home and car, has blamed passing airlines for the mess. Karen Bass, from Flatbush in Auckland, told the New Zealand Herald that she was sure the 'huge clumps', that she also found on the footpath near her house, were human faeces. 'The first thing when I walked out of my door this morning and I saw it, I thought an airplane s*** on us. You open the door and it smells like s***,' she said. Scroll down for video . Karen Bass found her Auckland home and car covered in what she claims was human faeces that fell from a passing plane . The disgusted resident, whose home is in the flight path for airlines on their way to Auckland International Airport, plans to have a sample of the matter tested. 'There's no way it's a bird or animal poo, it's horrible. I'm sure it's human, what else could it be with huge clumps like that?' Ms Bass told the New Zealand Herald. Despite not being the first New Zealand citizen to suggest a passing air-plane offloaded human waste above their home, both Airways New Zealand and the country's Civil Aviation Authority deny having record of any incidents. Sydney Airline safety consultant, Trevor Bock, also expressed doubt over a plane's involvement and suggested Ms Bass' incident was more likely caused by 'bad neighbours'. Ms Bass' house is in the direct flight path to Auckland International Airport (pictured) 'It's certainly not coming from an aircraft because maintenance standards are extremely high today,' Mr Bock told Daily Mail Australia. He explained that the waste in a plane goes from the toilet into a sewage tank which is emptied out periodically in a highly controlled environment by specialised trucks carrying large hoses and tanks – often after every second trip. The fittings for the tank are on the outside of the aircraft and thus only accessible by ground handling staff, meaning a spontaneous mid-air release is difficult to control. Airline safety consultant, Trevor Bock, said it was 'impossible' that the excrement came from a plane as maintenance standards are extremely high, with trucks collecting the sewage after every second flight . 'There's nothing that comes out of a plane unless there's something wrong with it,' the former pilot assured. 'Modern planes use a vacuum system, so the chances of a leak are extremely remote and it would be spotted on the ground before an aircraft departed because the engineers and pilots do a thorough walk around the aircraft before take-off to check on these sorts of things. 'It's just another urban myth.'","Karen Bass says she woke up to faeces covering her home and car .

"A six-year-old boy died on June 3 after creating a noose out of a belt and hanging himself from the freezer door of his family refrigerator (not pictured) A six-year-old boy from Idaho committed suicide by hanging himself in his family's kitchen, according to police. The . boy, who has not been named, died on June 3. After a month-long investigation, investigators have ruled his death a suicide, making his the fourth confirmed case of a six-year-old committing suicide in the U.S. since 2007, according to The Argus Observer. The boy and his seven-year-old sister . were watching television together just before his death, while their . mother and stepfather were showering. The sister later reported that her . brother left the TV room and about 20 minutes later, started making . noise in the kitchen. When she went to check on him, she found his body and screamed for her parents. The parents rushed to the kitchen, called 911, and started performing CPR until paramedics arrived. When authorities arrived on the scene, both parents were still drenched from the shower and wearing towels. Payette Police Chief Mark Clark told The Argus Observer that he assigned four detectives to investigate the death and they found no sign of foul play. Clark said investigators were unable to determine whether the boy intentionally committed suicide, but that school records and interviews with relatives indicated the child had some anger issues related to his parents' divorce two years earlier. Lucas Hooker, a Lifeways qualified mental health professional in Oregon and a licensed professional counselor in Idaho, said that situations like this are difficult to comprehend, especially when they involve such a young child. He said if parents are concerned their child is having difficulty adjusting to major life changes or other issues, they can discuss the matter with a pediatrician and get a referral to a mental health provider. Some kids lack the verbal and cognitive ability to properly express their emotions and may 'lash out' as a result, Hooker said. Signs that a child is having trouble include aggression or other unusual behavior, nightmares, unusual bedwetting or appearing to feel hopeless, Hooker said, and some depressed children may become preoccupied with thoughts of death. 'If a parent's gut is telling them that something is wrong, they need to follow that,' Hooker said. 'It's also important for people to know if there has been a prior suicide in the family or if the child is actually verbalizing suicide to get help. If there's a family history of suicide, the odds of the child being suicidal jump exponentially.'

"Michael Meacher (pictured) claimed welfare reforms had left claimants 'forced to steal to survive' A former Labour minister has urged juries not to convict people for stealing if their benefits have been withdrawn. Michael Meacher, an ex-environment minister, claimed that Iain Duncan Smith’s welfare reforms had left claimants ‘forced to steal to survive’. In an inflammatory newspaper article, he said the policy of removing benefits from those who failed to attend scheduled job interviews was ‘crucifying millions of people’. And he said it would be ‘perfectly reasonable’ for jurors to follow the example set by those in the 19th century, who refused to convict desperate food thieves to save them from being hanged. Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps called Mr Meacher’s comments ‘ludicrous’ and said they amounted to an amnesty on crime. Mr Meacher, who served in Tony Blair’s government, wrote: ‘A million people have been sanctioned by government ministers over the last year, which means they are deprived of all their benefit for often petty infringements such as being five minutes late for a job interview – and hence have no money for at least four weeks and sometimes three months, forcing them to steal to survive. ‘Iain Duncan Smith supervises the sanctioning – though it’s outsourced to a privatised firm doing his dirty work for him – while [Justice Secretary] Chris Grayling takes care of the imprisonment.’ The MP for Oldham West and Royton added: ‘During and after the Napoleonic wars there were up to 200 offences for which a person could be hanged, usually for stealing to keep their family alive. ‘The people of this country sitting on the juries finally got round this draconian repression imposed by the ruling class by refusing to convict. That is what juries and magistrates should do now when faced by the stark injustice of the criminal justice system.’ Writing in the far-Left Morning Star newspaper, he accused ministers of ‘crucifying millions of people even to the point where they’re denying them food and shelter’. Asked about his comments on LBC Radio yesterday, he gave examples from his constituency of two people who had their benefits removed for missing job interviews. One said the interview letter had been sent to an old address, and another had told the Department for Work and Pensions he was having an operation that day. Mr Meacher told presenter Julia Hartley-Brewer that people who could not find a job in their area had no to option but to steal. ‘That person should never have been put in that position, the authorities shouldn’t have removed benefit,’ he said. Callers to the programme were split on the issue, but some who disagreed had previously received benefits. Mr Meacher blamed Iain Duncan Smith (left), Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, and Chris Grayling (right), the Secretary of State for Justice, for depriving people across Britain . However Mr Shapps said: ‘Michael Meacher’s ludicrous comments betray how out of touch the Labour Party are. Labour have opposed every decision we’ve taken to get people off benefits and back into work. And now they want an amnesty on crime. Hard-working taxpayers would pay the price.’ A Labour spokesman said that ‘the Labour Party does not condone illegal behaviour’. The Department for Work and Pensions said sanctions were only applied to 6 per cent of claimants. Benefit payments were stopped 853,000 times in the year to June 2014, a slight fall on the previous year, for failing to attend appointments or rejecting job offers. A spokesman said: ‘It’s unhelpful to make these claims without demonstrating any solid evidence. ‘Sanctions are a necessary part of the benefits system, but they are used as a last resort in a tiny percentage of cases where people don’t play by the rules.’ He added: ‘We also have a well-established system of hardship payments for benefit claimants who have little or no other resources available to them.’","Ex-minister Michael Meacher urges juries not to convict benefit thieves .

"More than a million women are denied pills that could halve their chance of developing breast cancer because of red tape, experts warn. They say those at greater risk should be offered a preventative treatment that costs as little as 7p a day. But the drugs are not licensed for this use – making doctors reluctant to prescribe them in case patients sue over side effects. More than a million women have been denied pills that could halve their chance of developing breast cancer . Breast Cancer Campaign research estimates that if women were properly screened, and those at risk were offered the drugs, nearly 4,000 cases a year could be prevented. Tamoxifen, Raloxifene and Anastrozole block oestrogen and are used to treat breast cancer. But the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency has not licensed them for preventative use, which costs 7p to 61p a day and cuts risk by 40 to 50 per cent. MHRA says drug firms must apply for a new licence so it can assess the pills’ ‘safety, efficacy and quality’ – a very expensive process that would take years. Mia Rosenblatt, of Breast Cancer Campaign, said: ‘It’s incomprehensible that there are low-cost, effective treatments out there which are not routinely available to patients because of red tape.’ Campaigners also said the lack of screening means many women do not realise they are at risk due to factors such as having the genes BRCA1 and BRCA2, high breast density, hormone replacement therapy, smoking and having children later in life. They said NHS screening should be expanded, with women over 50 filling in a risk assessment form every three years. Professor Anthony Howell, who carried out the research, said: ‘There’s a big group of women out there who don’t know they are at increased risk and who can’t get these drugs.’ He added the MHRA ‘haven’t thought it through’. The charity says 10 to 15 per cent of women over 50 – some 1.3million – have an increased risk of breast cancer, but a ‘minuscule’ number are taking the drugs. However, the pills can cause nausea, weight gain and even blood clots. A new breast cancer drug can extend patients’ lives by an extra year and four months on average compared to standard treatment, US researchers say. Perjeta, for those with advanced cancer, achieved ‘phenomenal’ results in a trial. NHS watchdog NICE said it was unlikely to be cost effective. Young women with cervical cancer symptoms are waiting up to six months for a diagnosis, a study shows. King’s College London researchers said that pain and bleeding are being dismissed as side effects of the Pill by women and family doctors. They studied 128 patients under 30. Most had been identified by the NHS screening programme before they realised anything was wrong. But of those who did notice symptoms, 28 per cent said they then waited three months to go to a GP. Even after seeing a doctor, 60 per cent had to wait three more months for a formal diagnosis. The disease is the most common form of cancer in women under 35, with around 900 cases a year. A third of patients will die within five years.","One million women denied pills that could halve  chance of developing cancer .

"NBA great Charles Barkley has spoken his mind once again, this time to voice support for the grand jury that chose not to indict Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson. Barkley, 51, isn't known for keeping opinions to himself and the African American basketball legend was in top form Tuesday when he addressed the controversy in Missouri during a radio interview. 'There is no excuse for people to be out there burning down people's businesses, burning down police cars,' he told Mike Missanelli of Philadelphia's 97.5 The Fanatic as he referred to the rioters as 'scumbags.' Scroll down for video . Supports the police: Former NBA star Charles Barkley told a Philadelphia radio show host last week that he supports the Ferguson police and the grand jury's decision not to indict unarmed black teen Michael Brown's killer Darren Wilson . 'Scumbags': Barkley made his stance known to Mike Missanelli (pictured) of Philadelphia's 97.5 The Fanatic on Tuesday, when he described the looters in Ferguson as 'scumbags' The former 76er told Missanelli that he believes black neighborhoods would crumble if not for the help of police . Barkley went on to commend police who work in black areas. 'If it wasn’t for the cops we would be living in the Wild, Wild West in our neighborhoods,' he said. 'We can’t pick out certain incidentals that don’t go our way and act like the cops are all bad. 'Do you know how bad some of these neighborhoods would be if it wasn't for the cops?' he said. Barkley, who's become a high-profile sports commentator since leaving the NBA behind in 2000, said the media is at fault for at least some of what's gone on in the wake of Michael Brown's August 4 death. 'The true story came out from the grand jury testimony,' he said. 'I can’t believe anything I hear on television anymore. 'And, that’s why I don’t like talking about race issues with the media anymore, because they  love this stuff, and lead people to jump to conclusions. 'The media shouldn’t do that. They never do that when black people kill each other.' Barkley also publicly sided with a decision to exonerate George Zimmerman in 2013 after he was tried in the shooting death of another unarmed black teen, Trayvon Martin, notes the Christian Science Monitor. Meanwhile, others in the major league sports realm have come forward in recent days to support the outraged black citizens of Ferguson. Five St. Louis Rams players stood on Sunday with their arms raised in an apparent show of solidarity for Ferguson protesters before trotting onto the field for pregame introductions. Wide receivers Tavon Austin and Kenny Britt came out together first, with the move obscured by a smoke machine in the upper reaches of the Edward Jones Dome. Stedman Bailey, Jared Cook and Chris Givens — all of whom are black — then came out and stood together with arms raised. After Tre Mason scored on an 8-yard run to make it 45-0 in the fourth quarter, he and Britt raised their hands together. Looters robbed Ferguson businesses and set fire to property in the wake of the grand jury decision not to convict Darren Wilson, which many have criticized as a step in the wrong direction for the town where tensions between citizens and police have long been an issue . There have been riots, looting and buildings burned in Ferguson since a grand jury declined Monday to indict police officer Darren Wilson in the shooting death of unarmed Michael Brown in August. Across the street from the stadium, about 75 protesters gathered in the second half as about 30 police wearing riot gear watched from a safe distance. Protesters chanted ""Hands up, don't shoot!"" ''No Justice, No Football!"" ''This is what Democracy looks like,"" and ""We're here for Mike Brown."" The Rams had additional security measures in place for the game, including armed personnel from the National Guard. The team has wanded fans outside entrances all season. On another front inside the stadium, a group of fans formed letters spelling ""Keep the Rams in St. Louis"" in seats in the north end zone.

"The speech by former US Vice-President Al Gore was apocalyptic. ‘The North Polar ice cap is falling off a cliff,’ he said. ‘It could be completely gone in summer in as little as seven years. Seven years from now.’ Those comments came in 2007 as Mr Gore accepted the Nobel Peace Prize for his campaigning on climate change. But seven years after his warning, The Mail on Sunday can reveal that, far from vanishing, the Arctic ice cap has expanded for the second year in succession – with a surge, depending on how you measure it, of between 43 and 63 per cent since 2012. Scroll down for video . To put it another way, an area the size of Alaska, America’s biggest state, was open water two years ago, but is again now covered by ice. The most widely used measurements of Arctic ice extent are the daily satellite readings issued by the US National Snow and Ice Data Center, which is co-funded by Nasa. These reveal that – while the long-term trend still shows a decline – last Monday, August 25, the area of the Arctic Ocean with at least 15 per cent ice cover was 5.62 million square kilometres. This was the highest level recorded on that date since 2006 (see graph, right), and represents an increase of 1.71 million square kilometres over the past two years – an impressive 43 per cent. Other figures from the Danish Meteorological Institute suggest that the growth has been even more dramatic. Using a different measure, the area with at least 30 per cent ice cover, these reveal a 63 per cent rise – from 2.7 million to 4.4 million square kilometres. The satellite images published here are taken from a further authoritative source, the University of Illinois’s Cryosphere project. They show that as well as becoming more extensive, the ice has grown more concentrated, with the purple areas – denoting regions where the ice pack is most dense – increasing markedly. Crucially, the ice is also thicker, and therefore more resilient to future melting. Professor Andrew Shepherd, of Leeds University and University Coillege, London, an expert in climate satellite monitoring, said yesterday: ‘It is clear from the measurements we have collected that the Arctic sea ice has experienced a significant recovery in thickness over the past year. ‘It seems that an unusually cool summer in 2013 allowed more ice to survive through to last winter. This means that the Arctic sea ice pack is thicker and stronger than usual, and this should be taken into account when making predictions of its future extent.’ The speech by former US Vice-President Al Gore (above) was apocalyptic. He said that the North Polar ice cap is falling off a cliff and could be gone in seven years . Yet for years, many have been claiming that the Arctic is in an ‘irrevocable death spiral’, with imminent ice-free summers bound to trigger further disasters. These include gigantic releases of methane into the atmosphere from frozen Arctic deposits, and accelerated global warming caused by the fact that heat from the sun will no longer be reflected back by the ice into space. Judith Curry, professor of earth and atmospheric sciences at Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, said last night: ‘The Arctic sea ice spiral of death seems to have reversed.’ Those who just a few years ago were warning of ice-free summers by 2014 included US Secretary of State John Kerry, who made the same bogus prediction in 2009, while Mr Gore has repeated it numerous times – notably in a speech to world leaders at the UN climate conference in Copenhagen in 2009, in an effort to persuade them to agree a new emissions treaty. Mr Gore – whose office yesterday failed to respond to a request for comment – insisted then: ‘There is a 75 per cent chance that the entire polar ice cap during some of the summer months could be completely ice-free within five to seven years.’ Misleading as such forecasts are, some people continue to make them. Only last month, while giving evidence to a House of Lords Select Committee inquiry on the Arctic, Cambridge University’s Professor Peter Wadhams claimed that although the Arctic is not ice-free this year, it will be by September 2015. Asked about this yesterday, he said: ‘I still think that it is very likely that by mid-September 2015, the ice area will be less than one million square kilometres – the official designation of ice-free, implying only a fringe of floes around the coastlines. That is where the trend is taking us.’ For that prediction to come true it would require by far the fastest loss of ice in history. It would also fly in the face of a report last year by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which stated with ‘medium confidence’ that ice levels would ‘likely’ fall below one million square kilometres by 2050. Politicians such as Al Gore have often insisted that climate science is ‘settled’ and have accused those who question their forecasts of being climate change ‘deniers’. However, while few scientists doubt that carbon-dioxide emissions cause global warming, and that this has caused Arctic ice to decline, there remains much uncertainty about the speed of melting and how much of it is due to human activity. But outside the scientific community, the more pessimistic views have attracted most attention. For example, Prof Wadhams’s forecasts have been cited widely by newspapers and the BBC. But many reject them. An area twice the size of Alaska was open water two years ago and is now covered in ice after the arctic ice cap has expanded for the second year in a row . Yesterday Dr Ed Hawkins, who leads an Arctic ice research team at Reading University, said: ‘Peter Wadhams’s views are quite extreme compared to the views of many other climate scientists, and also compared to what the IPCC report says.’ Dr Hawkins warned against reading too much into ice increase over the past two years on the grounds that 2012 was an ‘extreme low’, triggered by freak weather. ‘I’m uncomfortable with the idea of people saying the ice has bounced back,’ he said. However, Dr Hawkins added that the decline seen in recent years was not caused only by global warming. It was, he said, intensified by ‘natural variability’ – shifts in factors such as the temperature of the oceans. This, he said, has happened before, such as in the 1920s and 1930s, when ‘there was likely some sea ice retreat’. Dr Hawkins said: ‘There is undoubtedly some natural variability on top of the long-term downwards trend caused by the overall warming. This variability has probably contributed somewhat to the post-2000 steep declining trend, although the human-caused component still dominates.’ Like many scientists, Dr Hawkins said these natural processes may be cyclical. If and when they go into reverse, they will cool, not warm, the Arctic, in which case, he said, ‘a decade with no declining trend’ in ice cover would be ‘entirely plausible’. Peer-reviewed research suggests that at least until 2005, natural variability was responsible for half the ice decline. But exactly how big its influence is remains an open question – and as both Dr Hawkins and Prof Curry agreed, establishing this is critical to making predictions about the Arctic’s future. Prof Curry said: ‘I suspect that the portion of the decline in the sea ice attributable to natural variability could be even larger than half. ‘I think the natural variability component of Arctic sea ice extent is in the process of bottoming out, with a reversal to start within the next decade. And when it does, the reversal period could last for several decades.’ This led her to believe that the IPCC forecast, like Al Gore’s, was too pessimistic. ‘Ice-free in 2050 is a possible scenario, but I don’t think it is a likely scenario,’ she concluded. The apparent recovery in Arctic ice looks like good news for polar bears. If there is more ice at the end of the summer, they can hunt seals more easily. Yet even when the ice reached a low point in 2012, there was no scientific evidence that bear numbers were declining, with their estimated total of 20,000 to 25,000 thought to be higher than in the 1970s, when hunting was first banned. In many Arctic regions, say scientists, they are in robust health and breeding successfully. Computer model predictions of decline caused by ice melt have also failed to come true. In 2004, researchers claimed Hudson Bay bear numbers would fall from 900 to fewer than 700 by 2011. In fact, they have risen to over 1,000. However, the main international bear science body, the Polar Bear Specialist Group, admits it has no reliable data from almost half of the Arctic, so cannot say whether numbers are falling or rising.","Seven years after former US Vice-President Al Gore's warning, Arctic ice cap has expanded for second year in row .

"Chelsea could have been awarded a penalty in the first half of their Premier League clash with Manchester United at Old Trafford on Sunday. There were two separate incidents in the area as Chris Smalling appeared to wrestle Branislav Ivanovic to the ground as Marcos Rojo similarly seemed to hold John Terry. Sportsmail's GRAHAM POLL gives his verdict of Phil Dowd's handling of the incident. Chris Smalling and Marcos Rojo both appear to headlock Branislav Ivanovic and John Terry . Smalling appears to blatantly pull down Branislav Ivanovic in the penalty area at Old Trafford . Ivanovic is holding onto Smalling after being dragged down in the area by the Manchester United defender . The Chelsea defender appeals to Phil Dowd shortly after the incident in the Man United area . You could argue it should be two penalties. It’s not just Chris Smalling on Ivanovic, you’ve got Rojo on Terry. The two have virtually got them in headlocks. From Dowd’s position he should see this. You can tell by Ivanovic’s reaction; he’s not just appealing — he’s going berserk. The Manchester United ones are worse than Shawcross (versus Swansea) last week. Phil Dowd let Chelsea down by ignoring two headlocks by Manchester United defenders at the same setpiece and by doing so also let his select list colleague Michael Oliver down. Oliver was the referee who correctly awarded Swansea a penalty when Ryan Shawcross held Wilfried Bony and Dowd had the chance to reinforce referees resolve to stop this practise by awarding Chelsea the penalty they deserved for either Marcos Rojo’s hold on John Terry or Chris Smalling’s even more blatant hold on Branislav Ivanovic. Dowd chose to stick to his belief that you are remembered for what you give and not what you miss or ignore and that was a major disappointment to all neutrals who are fed up with this continual holding at set pieces. Sky Sports reviewed the incident at half-time and show both Terry and Ivanovic being held in the box .

"Apple’s eagerly awaited iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus handsets go on sale in nine days. But this hasn't stopped fans queuing up outside Apple shops around the world so they can be among the first to own the new smartphones. People with prime spots outside these shops could also earn money for being so keen - with one place in New York already being sold for $2,500 (£1,500). Scroll down for video . Almost there: Apple's eagerly awaited iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus handsets go on sale tomorrow. But this hasn't stopped fans queuing up outside Apple shops around the world so they can be among the first to own the new smartphones. This photo was taken of fans in Tokyo earlier today . Fans in Tokyo (pictured) began queuing for the devices, which have been met with rave reviews from journalists, on the day of Apple's event last week . In Tokyo and Sydney, groups are camped outside in relatively balmy weather, while in London, tents are already positioned outside the Apple Store on Regent Street. A handful of fans have been queuing outside the firm's Fifth Avenue store since September 1, when the phones were still a rumour. 'We wanted to beat the record, which had been 18 days,' Brian Ceballo, who arrived at Apple's NYC flagship on Sunday to wait, told CNBC. One couple - Moon Ray, 25 and Jason, 29, were among seven people in new York queuing up a week ago. Pictured today, Florin Barbu, (left) originally from Romania but now living in the UK, Stig Martin Pfiska (centre) from Norway and Richard Parkes (right) from Chelmsford queue outside the Apple Store in Covent Garden, London as they wait for the new iPhone 6 to go on sale . Checking in: These fans are today queuing outside the Apple Store on Regent Street, London. They have been fortunate that the weather has remained warm ahead of tomorrow's launch . They travelled over 1,000 miles (1,609km) from Jackson, Mississippi and arrived in New York on September 1 to find that they were not first in the queue, because cousins and New Yorkers Joseph Cruz and Brian Ceballo had beaten them to it. The Mississippi couple paid $2,500 (£1,500) to swap places with the cousins. Zoltan Wiettchen, 24, is the first in line in London after staking a place at 9pm on Monday night. Mr Wiettchen, a Hungarian national who has been in this country for two years, said he is not planning on buying one of the handsets, but rather in the money he can make from queuing up. Cosy queuing: A handful of fans have been queuing outside the firm's Fifth Avenue store since  September 3, when the phones were still a rumour. This means they will have been camping out for over two weeks . The wait is on: People with prime spots outside shops could earn big bucks for their patience and some plan on selling their places in the queue for up to £1,000. Here, tents are pitched outside Apple's flagship store on London's Regent Street . Finally unveiled: Apple showed off two handsets last night as well as a smartwatch called Apple Watch. The iPhone 6 (pictured left) has a 4.7-inch screen, curved edges and will be available in dark black and gold, while the iPhone 6 Plus (right) has a 5.5-inch screen and 185 per cent more pixels than the 5S . Waiting with a friend: The iPhone 6 will start at $199 on a two-year contract for 16GB, $299 for 64GB and $399 for 128GB, while the iPhone 6 Plus starts at $299 for 16GB, $399 for 64GB and $499 for 128GB. Here, a queues for the handset 10 days in advance in Tokyo - with a mask of late Apple founder, Steve Jobs . A comfortable wait: People are queuing up with their tents and seats outside Apple Fifth Avenue to buy the new iPhone handsets. These fans have been queuing since September 5 . ‘I don’t care about the phone at all. I’m not here for that,’ he said. ‘But I know lots of people do care about it and would be desperate to be the first person to use it. ‘I’m queuing to sell my position and I’m hoping to get £1,000 for it. I want to start a business as a personal trainer and that money would help me out a lot. ‘I’ve just finished studying an English language course so had a bit of spare time. It’s a good experience and I need the money. ‘My girlfriend and I are sharing the camping, I’m sleeping here and she’s going to be here during the day. I may be here for the next 10 days but I’m off as soon as someone gives me an offer. ‘It’s very noisy here, I’m spending much of my time with my tent shut trying to sleep, but people keep interrupting me to ask me what I’m doing.’ Keen: Apple fans Salvatore Gerace (left) and Christian Ibrahim (right) have got in line early for the new iPhone 6 at the Apple Store in Sydney - with other gadgets to make the wait seem slightly shorter . Selling out? While some people camping out 10 days early are genuine fans, waiting to get their hands on the handset, others hope to sell their place in line. One person camped out in London (store pictured right) is hoping to get £1,000 for their efforts - which could buy them a couple of handsets at a later date . A couple who travelled more than 1,000 miles to stand in line outside the Apple store on Fifth Avenue, New York, have paid $2,500 (£1,500) to be first in line. Moon Ray 25, and her husband Jason, 29 travelled from Jackson, Mississippi on September 1 to discover there was already a queue outside the shop. Cousins Joseph Cruz and Brian Ceballo from Statten Island, New York had beaten them to it by one day – but happily accepted the money to switch places. ‘We take turns going to the bathroom and washing and working out at the gym nearby,’ Ms Moon said . ‘We only sleep a couple of hours a night - I brought a tent but cried when they told me I couldn’t use it.’ Joseph, who was third in line last week, is a veteran at waiting in line for Apple product, having camped out for new releases before. Ms Moon said: ‘People passing by say all sorts of things to us - they think we’re crazy.’ One of the tents is being manned by Task Rabbit, an online company that outsources household errands, after being paid by a client to queue up on their behalf. Uma Subramanian of the firm, said: ‘We’re taking it in turns to man the tent for a client who requested our services online. I cannot say how much he paid us or who he is, because that’s confidential, but our workers charge between £10 and £20 an hour for whatever activity they have been paid to do.’ Apple unveiled its latest smartphone last night alongside its much hyped Apple Watch. The iPhone 6 has a 4.7-inch screen, curved edges and will be available in dark black and gold, while the iPhone 6 Plus has a 5.5-inch screen and 185 per cent more pixels than the 5S. The iPhone 6 will start at $199 on a two-year contract for 16GB, $299 for 64GB and $399 for 128GB, while the iPhone 6 Plus starts at $299 for 16GB, $399 for 64GB and $499 for 128GB. The iPhone 6 is 6.9mm and the iPhone 6 Plus is 7.1mm thick, compared to 7.6mm on the 5S. Both devices have Retina HD displays. Both handsets feature the new Apple A8 64-bit chip, an 8MP camera and iOS 8 software, among a host of other features. How the handsets stack up: The iPhone 6 is 6.9mm, the iPhone 6 Plus is 7.1mm thick. This table shows how the new handsets compare with rival offerings .

"Being able to help yourself to drinks in a pub sounds like an idyllic dream, but one pub owner in Swansea is attempting to bring this slice of utopia to reality.

With screens scattered throughout the unusual public house, customers will be able to pay for their drinks in advance. Or they can open a tab so they can be given a special card, which is scanned with a sensor at the iPad on their table. for drinkers which are markedly different than traditional practices. Mr Lingwood said a similar pub is opening in Edinburgh and he is confident the ambitious idea could be adopted throughout the country.

Mr Lingwood said, 'Fingers crossed it'll spread throughout the country. I think it's great for our customers to try something new, to have that little bit of extra fun in the evening.' However, not all of the customers are completely behind the initiative. Customer Leon Bartoszewicz raised his concerns about the possibility of children accessing alcoholic drinks with the new ordering technology and asked, 'How does that machine know your age?'

"The Government will 'build and sell' family homes in a desperate bid to end Britain's housing crisis, ministers revealed today. Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander said 300,000 new homes a year were needed but building firms were failing to meet the demand. He said this had forced ministers to 'think radically' and consider using taxpayers' money to kick start a new housing boom. Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander said 300,000 new homes a year were needed but not being built . Mr Alexander said: 'The message to the housebuilding sector would be simple: if you don't build them, we will.' The proposal - unveiled today ahead of George Osborne's crunch Autumn Statement tomorrow - will be trialled at a former RAF base in Cambridgeshire and could lead to homes being built twice as fast as the more conventional route. Launching the National Infrastructure Plan, which also includes details of £15 billion of road projects, £2.3 billion of flood defences and a range of energy programmes, Mr Alexander said the Government had to act to address the housing shortage. He said £100 million was being made available for the new garden city at Ebbsfleet, ministers will back the development of a 13,000-home new town at Bicester, in Oxfordshire, and the extension of the London Overground to Barking Riverside will help unlock the construction of up to 11,000 properties. The affordable homes programme will also be extended for a further two years, Mr Alexander said. But in order to meet the demand for 300,000 new homes a year 'requires us to think radically'. 'An idea that I have been promoting is direct government commissioning of housing. Government - national or local - would take responsibility for ensuring the number of homes we need each year. 'The message to the housebuilding sector would be simple: if you don't build them, we will.' Lord Deighton (left) and the Treasury chief Danny Alexander (right) hailed the publication of today's National Infrastructure Plan . There will be a detailed review to examine the potential of direct government commissioning and the Homes and Communities Agency will lead on delivering up to 10,000 new properties at the former RAF base at Northstowe in Cambridgeshire to trial the model. 'Now it's just a disused RAF base but soon it will be a development of up to 10,000 homes thanks to the pioneering action this Government has taken in trialling the new delivery model,' Mr Alexander said. 'This is the first time in a generation that the Government has owned land, led the development on it at this scale and considered commissioning homes directly.' The model would allow homes to be built quicker and give the state the ability to 'ensure developers build the most appropriate type of houses and the right associated infrastructure'. Mr Alexander said: 'We are examining in more detail the idea of direct commissioning as a solution for the whole country and piloting it on this enormously important site.' Asked whether the need to build more homes would require the development of greenfield sites, Mr Alexander said he did not 'necessarily accept' that would be the case. 'That's something that would need to be worked through in delivering this,' he said. He said redeveloping public sector land, such as Northstowe, could help meet the demand: 'We have released sites in this parliament for about 100,000 homes, we think. We want to see a much more ambitious approach in the next parliament. 'I think that is something that can really help to meet this agenda.' Meanwhile Treasury Commercial Secretary Lord Deighton said the compulsory purchase scheme could be changed, making it easier for people's homes to be bought to clear the way for major infrastructure projects. He said: 'We will be publishing a consultation paper at the next Budget to streamline and update the compulsory purchase regime to make it clearer, faster and fairer.'","Treasury Secretary Danny Alexander says 300,000 homes a year needed .

"The Ministry of Defence wasted £6 million on new high-tech earplugs that were supposed to allow soldiers to hear each other on the battlefield while blocking out the noise of explosions and gunfire. Senior officials tested the equipment in the UK before authorising the purchase. However, once the earplugs were tested on the battlefield, they were found to be ineffective. Each set of earplugs was specially moulded for an individual soldier at a cost of £500. The new ear plugs were designed to allow soldiers to communicate on the battlefield while protecting their hearing from the sound of gunfire, but the system was scrapped because it didn't work (file picture) The RAF were forced to write-off a BAE125 similar to this after it suffered hail damage at a cost of £488,000 . The Personalised Interfaced Hearing Protection system was believed to be similar to the technology used by pop stars. MoD officials ordered 10,000 sets of the ear plugs to help protect the hearing of soldiers. Troops are reluctant to use traditional ear defenders on the battlefield as they cannot hear their comrades or vital radio communications. At the same time, the MoD admitted that it paid out £374,000 due to 'Noise Induced Sensorineural Hearing Loss'. The MoD also wasted £7.2 million on a mobile mine detection capability for Warrior vehicles, which was deemed 'unsuitable'. According to the report, an RAF HS125 aircraft was removed from service early after it sustained damage during a hailstorm, costing the taxpayer £488,000. A stock take at RAF Marham discovered £10 million of missing equipment, while £1.5 million was spent on faulty software. In total, approximately £5.7 billion was wasted by the MoD, with £860 million spent on obsolete equipment. Shadow defence secretary Vernon Coaker said troops were being sacked while 'money was frittered away on dud equipment'. The Ministry of Defence told The Sun: 'The ear defenders were trialled ahead of use in theatre, but during the constant rhythm of operations it became clear they required modification.'","MoD purchased 10,000 sets of high-tech ear plugs which did not work .

"Manchester United travel to the Etihad Stadium on Sunday afternoon searching for redemption after the 4-1 mauling they suffered there last season. But how should Louis van Gaal's side set themselves up tactically? Sportsmail's Martin Keown takes a look. MANCHESTER UNITED . Watching Marouane Fellaini at the World Cup, he did well operating in a midfield three. In his last two United games he has played in a similar role – on the side of a diamond that can become a three. He looked much better for it. It’s a role that allows him to break forward from deep but also help out and cover when needed.

Last year City found the perfect balance between defence and attack, but this season they are struggling. You have to admire Pellegrini’s philosophy of playing with two strikers but to continue their incredible record in this fixture – they have won five of the last six Premier League Manchester derbies – City need an extra midfielder. With David Silva out, they will miss a lot of creativity so they could use two holding midfielders and push Yaya Toure forward.

"After losing two straight home games heading into a tilt as the away team at Wembley against the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday, Dallas Cowboys players were happy to see quarterback Tony Romo back at practice on Thursday. Besides Romo himself, perhaps no one was happier than wide receiver Dez Bryant. The fifth-year pro, who called Romo’s return ‘very exciting’, said: ‘It was like he never left. We had a great day of practice. It was real good. We’re just going to move forward and see what happens on Sunday.’ ‘It always helps whenever Tony’s out there. He’s our guy. He’s our leader. Whenever he’s out there it makes everybody feel that much more comfortable. He know how to lead us in the right direction and that’s what he’s gonna do on Sunday.’ Tony Romo could return to the Dallas Cowboys starting line-up . The NFL’s leading rusher, DeMarco Murray, was glad to see Romo moving ‘like he always does’ in his return to the field. 'It was good to see him back out there,’ said the 26-year-old. ‘I thought he did well today. It’s always good to have your leader out there. We’re excited to have him back.’ Not having Romo throwing passes may have had an impact earlier in the week, but practising outside of the US wasn’t really an issue. Bryant said: . ‘I don’t think we’ve missed a beat. I was telling the guys, I don’t know if it’s London or the air, but I’m flying. Everybody else is flying around too. I got a little extra juice.’ Murray, who has 1,133 rushing yards this season, agreed the workouts at Allianz Park have been beneficial. He said: . ‘We’ve had two good days of practise. The mood is great. Obviously we haven’t been playing as expected individually or as a collective group. We’ve moved on. We’ve learned from the mistakes we made and the things we did well. We’ll continue to get better during the week and see what happens on Sunday.’ The Cowboys have struggled with Romo banged up during the last two games. The team has only scored 34 points combined and no player has suffered more than Bryant (five catches, 45 yards) in Romo’s absence. The former first round pick isn’t phased or feeling any added pressure to perform on Sunday with 34-year-old Romo likely operating at less than 100 per cent. Bryant said: . ‘I can only control what I can control. Y’all watch the same tape that I watch. When it comes my way, I’m gonna try and make the most of it. No pressure at all man. What is pressure?’ If the team continues to lean on the running game despite Romo’s return, it won’t bother Bryant. He said: . ‘Not at all. That’s our identity. We run the ball and we’re going to throw the ball whenever we need to. We’re just gonna continue to work on our mistakes, get the wrinkles out and get back together. We’re fine. Trust me, we are.’ With their focus squarely on prepping for Jacksonville, the Cowboys haven’t really had much time to explore or blow off steam. Bryant, who managed to squeeze in a steak dinner for his 25th birthday on Tuesday, is planning to ‘step out’ on Friday. ‘I want to see what’s out there,’ he said. ‘So far what I’ve seen is great. I’ve been having fun and I’m gonna try my best to come back in the offseason. I’m just looking forward to the rest of this London trip.’ It’s a trip that hasn’t included any celebratory cake, birthday or otherwise, thus far. ‘I can’t eat cake,’ Bryant said. ‘I gotta keep my abs right.’ If the offense performs well and the Cowboy leave Wembley with a win on Sunday, perhaps he’ll reconsider.","Dallas Cowboys wide receiver welcomes quarterback Tony Romo back to practice .

"The old record, set in 2012, was 60 peeps in two minutes. On Friday, Matt Stonie, engaged in the gooey challenge, eating a combination of both yellow — the original — and pink colored of the marshsmallow candy that is shaped like a chick. The candy is specially popular around Easter, when the manufacturer, Just Born, comes out with bunny Peeps. Scroll down for video . Just 15 seconds in, competitive eater Matt Stonie has already consumed 17 marsmallow peeps . Christie's lips have turned red from the pink colored Peeps he ate, as he finishes the last of 100 Peeps in just over two minutes . Stonie is in some discomfort after he ate 100 Peeps in two minutes and 10 seconds . More than 700 million of the candy chicks and bunnies are consumed annually in the United States. In a video posted on YouTube, unwrapped packages of Peeps can be seen before Stonei dumps them onto a kitchen counter. He then stacks the Peeps up neatly. When he starts eating, he put a row of five Peeps in his mouth at a time. A counter in the upper left hand corner keeps count. Dramatic music featuring drums plays in the background. In between eating rows, Stonie takes a drink from a small cup. The 100 Peeps are laid out on a kitchen counter before Stonie devoured them. An estimated 700 millions Peeps, made by Just Born, are eaten every year in the U.S. At one point, Stonie spits up a Peep, but quickly puts it back in his mouth and keeps on eating. When the 100th Peep is eaten, a stopwatch reads two minutes and 10 seconds. However, Stonie is not pleased. 'Damnit, I wanted two minutes,' he says. 'Not very good.' Stonie is not an amateur competitive eater. He has participated in eating challenges involving tacos, Big Macs (five in 60 seconds) and the legendary Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest held every July 4th in Coney Island, Brooklyn, New York. Stonie doesn't have much time to rest up before his next contest either. He will defend his title in a fried asparagus eating contest on April 26. Around Easter, some cities are known to host Peeps eating contests known as Peep Offs. The first one was held in Maryland in 2004.

"Christopher Pyne has denied 'harassing' senators in order to get them to support his higher education reforms, insisting that he holds an 'excellent relationship' with the Senate's crossbenchers. Palmer United Party Senator Glenn Lazarus accused the Education Minister of pestering him and others in a statement on Tuesday, saying he'd been 'inundated with text messages from Christopher Pyne' despite having never given him his mobile number. But Mr Pyne dismissed the accusations, suggesting that the 'seven or eight' messages he'd sent Senator Lazarus were entirely acceptable and telling ABC's 7.30 Report that he would be 'happy to send him more'. Scroll down for video . Education Minister Christopher Pyne has denied that he was 'harassing' Palmer United Party Senator Glenn Lazarus in order to gain his support for his higher education reforms package . 'Senator Lazarus is the only crossbench senator who has refused to meet with me to discuss these reforms, so the only avenue he's left to me to be able to communicate with him, besides letters, is SMS,' Mr Pyne told ABC reporter Leigh Sales. He then added: 'I hope you didn't mind the fact that I sent him a Christmas card today, Leigh, I'm sure he won't.' 'I would have sent him seven or eight texts and I'm happy to send him more texts.' Mr Pyne claimed that Mr Lazarus told a reporter he was happy for the Education Minister to send him 'as many texts as he wanted' after the post had been published, saying: 'I'm as confused as the next person about Senator Lazarus wanting me to send him texts or not'. 'I would have sent him seven or eight texts and I'm happy to send him more texts,' Mr Pyne told ABC's 7:30 . ABC journalist Leigh Sales, pointed Mr Pyne's ironic slip when pronouncing the name of cross bencher Zhenya 'Dio' Wang who he insisted he had an 'excellent relationship' with. He later scolded her, instructing her to study a bachelor of political science after being asked about the frequency of which he met with the crossbenchers . The Minister also made an ironic slip when pronouncing the name of cross bencher Zhenya 'Dio' Wang while insisting he had an 'excellent relationship' with him - a mistake that was quickly pointed out by Ms Sales. 'Well some people pronounce it Wang, some people pronounce it Wong; it depends where you are on the spectrum. But if you wish to pick me up on that Leigh, that's a very small thing and I'm surprised you'd bother with it. Never the less, Dio and I are good friends and I will continue to try and get their support,' he replied to the quip. Clearly put-off by the slip, Mr Pyne then scolded Ms Sales, instructing her to study a bachelor of political science after being asked about the frequency of which he met with the crossbenchers and the quality of the relationships they shared. 'I have met with some of the crossbenchers many, many times – in fact I've met with some of them six or seven or eight times, but I'm not going to go through the day-to-day machinations of how government works, Leigh,' he said. War of words. 'Christopher Pyne is embarrassing himself and needs to stop harassing me,' said Senator Glenn Lazarus of the Palmer United Party . 'You can go and study that at university if you wish to, in a bachelor of political science. The reality is that I'm working closely with the cross bench, I secured four of their votes today and I'll be back at it again tomorrow with a new reform bill.' The higher education reforms, which include a reduction in government funding and permit universities to set their own fees, were rejected by the Senate on Tuesday night with a vote of 33-31. Senators Lazarus and Wang were amongst those who voted against the bill, alongside independents Nick Xenophon and Jacqui Lambie and the Labor and the Greens parties. 'I have never given Christopher Pyne my mobile phone number,' said Senator Lazarus before the reforms were rejected by the Senate on Tuesday night . Mr Lazarus, who is the Leader of the Senate for PUP, claimed Mr Pyne had been virtually begging him to support the higher education reforms and urged him to stop his 'desperation'. 'Christopher Pyne is embarrassing himself and needs to stop harassing me and other cross benchers,' said Senator Glenn Lazarus. 'I am being inundated with text messages from Christopher Pyne virtually begging me to support the Abbott Government's higher education reforms. 'I have never given Christopher Pyne my mobile phone number.' The Senator claimed that Christopher Pyne's office and other Abbott Government ministers have been in constant contact with his office and those of other cross-benchers 'offering all sorts of deals and incentives to get our support for the higher education reforms'. Education Minister Christopher Pyne insists that 'let's be clear: there is no viable alternative to these reforms' But Senator Lazarus insisted that, 'I won't be bought and I am not prepared to horse trade'. 'It is clear that the Abbott Government is so desperate they will stoop to any level to win support. 'The majority of Australians do not want increased education costs. 'The higher education reforms are nothing more than a sinister Abbott Government budget cutting measure. 'The Abbott Government's higher education reforms are bad to the core and will only significantly reduce funding to universities which in turn will significantly increase the cost of higher education in Australia.' Senator Lazarus went on to doubt whether Christopher Pyne will retain the education portfolio in the next year and insisted that 'Palmer United will be voting down the higher education reforms'. Senator Glenn Lazarus says he doubts that Christopher Pyne, pictured here talking with the Prime Minister, will retain the education portfolio in the new year . With Labor and the Greens opposing the changes, the government would need support from 6 of the 8 cross-bench senators. Mr Pyne stated that: 'In the final week of Parliament for 2014 the Government is urging the Senate to pass the vital higher education reforms to secure the future of our universities and spread opportunity to more Australians.' 'Without these changes our universities will be condemned to a slow decline – losing their competitive edge in our region and internationally. 'Let's be clear: there is no viable alternative to these reforms.'","Glenn Lazarus accused the Minister of 'harassing' him and other crossbenchers in order to gain their support for higher education reforms .

"Dale Anderson, 25, (pictured right) and Emma Oliver, 22, (left) outside Manchester Crown Court - they gave the judge in their case a box of chocolates when their case finished . A judge was given a box of chocolates as a 'thank you' present from a couple facing drugs charges moments after he let them walk free. Judge Robert Atherton was  given the box of sweets by Dale Anderson, 25, and Emma Oliver, 22, as they left the dock at Manchester Crown Court. The 67-year old judge, who is believed to be retiring next year, then thanked the couple, from Moston, Manchester, for their gift and took the chocolates back to his chambers. The gift was a thank you for the way he had dealt with them given their previous experience. He joked to barristers as he left: 'I suppose you all want to know if you can have one. Well, ask me again in five months and then you can.' Afterwards Oliver was seen giving another box of Cadbury's Heroes to her defence barrister. Anderson and Oliver had been facing possible jail terms after a cannabis farm was found in a back room at their home. Police discovered 12 cannabis plants, enough to produce half a kilo of cannabis, while investigating the death of the couple's nine-month old daughter, Daisy, who drowned in the bath in a tragic accident. At a previous case at Manchester Crown Court the couple were defendants in a child neglect trial over the death of Daisy, but were acquitted. After the not guilty verdict was given by the jury it emerged Anderson admitted producing cannabis and Oliver pleaded guilty to allowing premises to be used to grow cannabis. At the sentencing yesterday market trader Anderson was given a six month community order with a condition he complete 42 hours unpaid work. Oliver, a trainee plasterer, was conditionally discharged for six months. Passing sentence Judge Atherton told them: 'There were 12 plants and it is likely you have produced around half a kilo which could have been sold - it was clearly a financial enterprise. Judge Robert Atherton (pictured) thanked the couple for giving him a box of chocolates . 'But this is an exceptional case in terms of what brought the police to your home. 'You know those circumstances only too well. I have expressed my views about the trauma you have gone through in dealing with that situation. 'I have never been slow to express my view on those matters and it is my view that you were rightfully acquitted. 'I think the sooner this matter is out of your lives, the better. Baby Daisy (pictured) was taken to North Manchester Children's Hospital but was pronounced dead . 'Cannabis needs to be out of your lives. Caring for each other is the essence of your future.' The investigation into the couple began in September 2012 after Daisy got into difficulties in a baby bath whilst Anderson went downstairs to find a clean towel and nappies and Oliver was talking about schools with a neighbour. When he returned Anderson found the infant lying face down in the water. Daisy was taken to North Manchester Children's Hospital where doctors tried to revive her but she was pronounced dead two hours later. Police began investigating Oliver and Anderson for child neglect after officers claimed they kept a 'dirty and unhygienic house' with dirty clothes and toys strewn across the floor. Neighbours were seen hoovering and tidying the house before police arrived while the couple were still at the hospital. Officers quickly halted the clean-up operation and noted the house had dirty nappies lying around, food on a high chair, dirty dishes covered in congealed food, damp clothing on the floor and dirty bed clothes on the cot. Anderson and Oliver both denied child neglect. In her statement to police Oliver said: 'Dale normally does bath time. I do the dry. 'I ran the bath. Dale came up and I have come down. Then Dale ran down the stairs white as a ghost saying there is something wrong with Daisy.' 'I put her on the floor on a Minnie Mouse towel and then started to give her mouth to mouth. Dale did CPR and a number of neighbours came over to try and help and call an ambulance.' When speaking about the attempts by doctors in hospital to save Daisy, Oliver added: 'She came back to life for 26 minutes. 'I do not understand how one minute she was breathing and the next she was not. 'I went to the toilet and when I came back her heart had stopped beating and she was pronounced dead. ' Manchester Crown Court (pictured) where Judge Robert Atherton was given the box of sweets by defendants . During the trial and in the absence of the jury, Judge Atherton questioned why the couple had been charged with child neglect as the baby had been left for a 'matter of seconds.' He agreed with defence assertions that the unhygienic and messy house was a 'snapshot' after a tragic event. The grammar school educated judge who was appointed in 2000 and lists his recreations as travel, music and gardening had previously attracted controversy over his tough sentencing stance on looters arrested during the 2011 riots. In 2008 he triggered outrage when he freed a paedophile who molested an 11-year-old girl amid claims the victim had 'welcomed' his advances. In 2013 he chaired the mental health tribunal which ordered Moors murderer Ian Brady to remain at Ashworth maximum security hospital.","Dale Anderson, 25, and Emma Oliver, 22, were in court on drugs charges .

"Researchers commissioned by Japan's health ministry discovered what they claim as high levels of the chemical formaldehyde in the chemical produced by heating several types of e-cigarette liquid. Formaldehyde is a substance that occurs naturally in the environment at low levels but is also found at higher levels in certain products such as building materials and embalming fluids. It is classed as a human carcinogen. E-cigarettes are becoming increasingly popular around the world, particularly among young people. E-cigarettes function by heating flavoured liquid, which often contains nicotine, to produce a vapour that is inhaled, much as the smoke from traditional cigarettes is inhaled. Scroll down for video . Supporters of e-cigarettes say the devices are a safer alternative to traditional tobacco, whose bouquet of toxic chemicals and gases can cause cancer, heart disease and strokes . Dr Naoki Kunugita, of the National Institute of Public Health, Japan, claims that the team found that 'more than 10 times the level of formaldehyde contained in one regular cigarette' were produced by 10 'puffs' of one brand of e-cigarette liquid. However, that result was not reported in the Japanese study and the amount of formaldehyde detected did vary through the course of analysis. When the wire which vaporises the liquid gets overheated, higher amounts of harmful substances seem to be produced, Dr Kunugita added. In general, levels of formaldehyde in e-cigarette vapour are up to 50 times lower compared to the levels found in tobacco cigarette smoke; and even the worst case Japanese product tested by the study produced levels of formaldehyde that were six times lower than in traditional cigarette smoke. In Japan, e-cigarettes are not regulated. Nicotine e-cigarettes, or so-called Electronic Nicotine Delivery System (ENDS), are subjected to the country's pharmaceutical laws. Although they are not readily available in shops as they are in the U.S. and Europe, they can be bought easily on the internet. 'You call them e-cigarettes, but they are products totally different from regular tobacco,' the ministry official said. 'The government is now studying the possible risks associated with them, with view to looking at how they should be regulated.' In August, the World Health Organisation (WHO) called on governments to ban the sale of e-cigarettes to minors, warning they pose a 'serious threat' to unborn babies and young people. Despite scant research on their effects, the WHO said there was enough evidence 'to caution children and adolescents, pregnant women, and women of reproductive age' about e-cigarette use. Supporters of e-cigarettes say the devices are a safer alternative to regular tobacco cigarettes, whose combination of toxic chemicals and gases can cause cancer, heart disease and strokes . This was due to the 'potential for foetal and adolescent nicotine exposure (having) long-term consequences for brain development'. The WHO also said they should be banned from indoor public spaces. Supporters of e-cigarettes say the devices are a safer alternative to traditional tobacco, whose bouquet of toxic chemicals and gases can cause cancer, heart disease and strokes. These are known to be among the leading causes of death in many countries. But opponents say the devices have only been around for a few years, and the long-term health impact from inhaling their vapour is unclear. Big tobacco companies are snapping up producers of e-cigarettes, wary of missing out on a snowballing global market worth about $3 billion. Earlier this month, Oxford Dictionaries picked 'vape' - the act of smoking an e-cigarette - as their new word of the year. *  An earlier version of this article stated that Japanese research had found that e-cigarettes contain 10 times more carcinogens than tobacco cigarettes. While the studyconducted by Dr Kunugita, Director of the Japanese Department of Environmental Health, did claim to have found such high levels of one carcinogen (formaldehyde) in the vapour from one brand of electronic cigarette, we would like to clarify that this result was not included in the published research. In fact, the Japanese study supports existing evidence that e-cigarettes are much less dangerous than tobacco products.","High levels of formaldehyde found in some e-cigarette vapour .

"An enterprising mother has ensured her children and their classmates can enjoy a nutritious hot school lunch after their canteen closed by becoming the new school cook. Children at St Andrew's Primary School in Buckland Monachorum, near Yelverton, Devon, had been reluctant to eat the hot meals on offer and the canteen kitchen was eventually closed. For 18 months all 202 pupils at the school had to make do with packed lunches everyday - and like many parents Susie Zaleski, 41, found it hard to come up with healthy lunchboxes . Susie Zaleski (pictured centre)  with pupils at St Andrew's School who now enjoy her nutritious school meals . She felt her children Aiya, eight, and Lola, six, would benefit from a decent hot meal during their school day. She set up a catering firm, won the contract at St Andrew's and now spends her days in the school's kitchen making everything from pizzas to Spanish chicken stew and chocolate brownies. Now, nearly every pupil in the school sits down at lunchtime to enjoy a delicious, locally sourced, child-friendly meal - compared to just 30 pupils a day in previous years. The Government's free school meals policy, which means every child aged five to seven is entitled to a hot lunch, has put pressure on catering staff across the country to come up with healthy, balanced menus to keep young diners and their parents happy. Susie has enlisted the help of other parents at the school to help her serve lunch and come up with simply, good-quality meal ideas for the children . Ms Zaleski, who has enlisted the help of other parents at the school to help her serve lunch, says she wants to show that it is not rocket science - children just want simple, good quality food. 'We've got kids at the school and we all know what they like,' she said. 'We run the menus past our own kids and they'll say 'yay' or 'no', depending on what we suggest. 'We cook everything from scratch. The spaghetti bolognaise is a recipe my mum used and we also follow recipes we've found online from Nigella Lawson or Mary Berry. 'We've had such amazing feedback from the children and parents. 'One little girl didn't eat anything for the first couple of days, but gradually she's started to try more and more. Her mum saw me in the street and said 'thank you so much'.' Ms Zalesk, who used to work as a waitress at the River Cafe restaurant in London before taking on various desk jobs, said moments like that have made her new role hugely satisfying. She said: 'I don't want to sound trite but it's so nice to feel as though you're putting something back into the community. 'We knew we wanted our children to have hot meals but we didn't want any old catering firm coming in and doing it. 'I just thought - let's go for it and do it ourselves' Living in Buckland Monachorum, she says says many parents are willing to pay the £2.30 it costs for each meal because they trust her as a fellow villager and playground mum. Now, in the 12 months her catering firm Zest has been up and running, she has had the chance to learn all the children's names and their dietry requirements, plus if they like a bit of extra gravy now and then. Tom Wilkinson and classmate Kashi Sen, both seven, said their school dinners were a real hit. 'They're amazing - we all really love them,' said Tom. 'They're so good,' said Kashi, 'About the same as my mum makes at home.' The Government's free school meals policy, which means every child aged five to seven is entitled to a hot lunch, has put pressure on catering staff across the country to come up with healthy, balanced menus . Headteacher Julie Tailyour, like many of her staff, regularly joins the children for lunch to take advantage of the local ingredients and home-cooked style. 'The meals here are absolutely lovely, we are delighted with the quality,' she said. MONDAY: Homemade chicken goujons or vegetable, tomato and mozarella pasta bake. Blueberry muffins. TUESDAY: Homemade lamb koftas or Quorn stew with herby dumplings. Stewed apple with blackberry and vanilla ice-cream. WEDNESDAY: Roast chicken or cheese and lentil roast. Oaty biscuits. THURSDAY: Homemade pizza. Fruit and natural yogurt. FRIDAY: Oven baked fish fingers or Quorn sausages. Pear and chocolate sponge and custard. 'It has made such a difference to the children. 'They are happier, more well behaved and settled. 'Before, when everyone had packed lunch, the atmosphere was rather like a picnic - it just wasn't right. 'Now the children look forward to their meal, they talk about their meal - they just love their dinners!' Mother Suzy Connor said that was certainly true for her children Holly, seven and Daisy, four. 'My two love their lunches,' she said. 'I am also happier, knowing they get a hot and healthy meal for lunch. 'They seem to have more energy now at the end of the day. 'I helped out one day for lunch and took some left over pizza back for our supper. It was better than any pizza that we had had at home before.'","Pupils were reluctant to eat meals on offer and the canteen kitchen closed .

"A truly captivating map that shows the ancestry of everyone of the 317 million people who call the melting pot of America home can now be seen on a U.S. Census Bureau map. For decades, the United States opened its doors and welcomed with open arms millions of immigrants who all arrived through New York's Ellis Island in the hope of a better life in America. Indeed, the inscription on the Statue of Liberty in New York's harbor reads 'Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to be free' and the fascinating map identifies the truly diverse nature of the United States in the 21st century. Although the 2010 census left out questions about ethnicity, this map shows how it looked in 2000, according to Upworthy. Melting pot: This map shows the ethnic heritage of Americans . 49,206,934 Germans . By far the largest ancestral group, stretching from coast to coast across 21st century America is German, with 49,206,934 people. The peak immigration for Germans was in the mid-19th century as thousands were driven from their homes by unemployment and unrest. The majority of German-Americans can now be found in the the center of the nation, with the majority living in Maricopa County, Arizona and according to Business Insider, famous German-Americans include, Ben Affleck, Tom Cruise, Walt Disney, Henry J. Heinz and Oscar Mayer. Indeed, despite having no successful New World colonies, the first significant groups of German immigrants arrived in the United States in the 1670s and settled in New York and Pennsylvania. Germans were attracted to America for familiar reasons, open tracts of land and religious freedom and their contributions to the nation included establishing the first kindergartens, Christmas trees and hot dogs and hamburgers. 41,284,752 Black or African Americans . The census map also identifies, Black or . African-American as a term for citizens of the United States who have . ancestry in Sub-Saharan Africa. The . majority of African Americans are descended from slaves from West and . Central Africa and of course have become an integral part of the story . of the United States, gaining the right to vote with the 15th amendment . in 1870, but struggling with their civil rights for at least another . century. Predominantly living in the south of the nation where they were brought to work on the cotton plantations and as slaves in the late 18th to mid-19th centuries, Black or African Americans also have sizable communities in the Chicago area of Illinois and Detroit, Michigan. 35,523,082 Irish . Another group who joined the great story of the United States were the Irish and the great famine of the 1840s sparked mass migration from Ireland. It is estimated that between 1820 and 1920, 4.5 million Irish moved to the United States and settled in the large cities like New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago and San Francisco. Currently, almost 12 percent of the total population of the United States claim Irish ancestry - compared with a total population of six and a half million for the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland today. Irish residents of note include John F. Kennedy, Derek Jeter and Neil Armstrong and 35,523,082 people call themselves Irish. 31,789,483 Mexican . And from 1990 to 2000, the number of people who claimed Mexican ancestry almost doubled in size to 31,789,483 people. Those with Mexican ancestry are most common along the Southwestern border of the United States and is largest ancestry in Los Angeles, Houston, Phoenix, San Diego, Dallas and San Antonio. 26,923,091 English . The next largest grouping of people in the United States by ancestry are those who claim to be English-American. Predominantly found in the Northwest and West, the number of people directly claiming to be English-American has dropped by 20 million since the 1980 U.S. Census because more citizens have started to identify themselves as American. They are based predominantly in the northeast of the country in New England and in Utah, where the majority of Mormon immigrants moved in the middle 19th century. Notable American people with English ancestry are Orson Welles and Bill Gates and 26,923,091 people claim to come from the land of the original Pilgrims. 19,911,467 Americans . The surprising number of people across . the nation claiming to have American ancestry is due to them making a . political statement, or because they are simply uncertain about their . direct descendants.

One of the most influential nationalities to migrate in large numbers to the United States were the Italians. Between 1880 and 1920, more than 4 million Italian immigrants arrived in the United States forming 'Little Italies' wherever they went. Bringing their food, culture and entertainment to the nation, another large wave of Italian immigrants arrived in the country following WWII, bringing the total number today to 17,558,598 people. 9,739,653 Polish . The largest of the Slavic groups to live in the United States, Polish Americans were some of the earliest Eastern European colonists to the New World. Up to 2.5 million Polies came to the United States between the mid-19th century and World War 1 and flocked to the largest industrial cities of New York, Buffalo, Cleveland, Milwaukee and Chicago. In many states, the Hispanic population doubled between the 2000 and 2010 census. In New Mexico, Hispanics outstripped whites for the first time, reaching 46 per cent compared to 40 per cent. 9,136,092 French . Historically, along with the English, the French colonized North America first and successfully in the North East in the border areas alongside Quebec and in the south around New Orleans and Louisiana.

Mexico, Montana and the Dakotas, with a higher concentration in Alaska. The map also reveals a concentration of people stating American as their ethnic heritage, mostly in the South. Many . may have stated American on the census form as a political statement, . or because they have a mixed or unknown heritage, according to Business Insider. While the United States has its roots in being a welcoming place for . immigrants, that hasn't always been the case. As a wave of new arrivals . flooded U.S. shores in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but a . movement to restrict who was allowed into the country took hold as well. In . 1882, Congress enacted the Chinese Exclusion Act, the first major . federal law to put immigration limits in place and the only one in . American history aimed at a specific nationality. It came into being in . response to fears, primarily on the West Coast, that an influx of . Chinese immigrants was weakening economic conditions and lowering wages. It was extended in 1902. Other laws followed, like the . Immigration Act of 1917, which created an ""Asiatic Barred Zone"" to . restrict immigration from that part of the world, and the Emergency . Quota Act of 1921, which limited the number of immigrants from any . country to 3 percent of those people from that country who had been . living in the United States as of 1910. The 1924 Immigration Act . capped the number of immigrants from a particular country at 2 percent . of the population of that country already living in the United States in . 1890. That favored immigrants from northern and western European . countries like Great Britain over immigrants from southern and eastern . European countries like Italy.

The law was revised in 1952, but kept the quota . system based on country of origin in the U.S. population and only . allowed low quotas to Asian nations. The American children of . Italian and other European immigrants saw that law ""as a slur against . their own status"" and fought for the system to be changed, said Mae .

"A Canadian woman sealed her husband's body in the bedroom for six months after his death while the family waited and prayed for his resurrection. Kaling Wald, 50, pleaded guilty Monday to not notifying authorities of her husband's death, as details in court revealed she allowed his body to rot  because she was expecting a truly miraculous recovery. The body of Peter Wald, who died at age 51, was discovered last September, the Hamilton Spectator reports. Devotion: An attorney argued that the family's religious devotion had 'warped' the judgement of Kaling Wald, 50, who let her husband's body decompose for six months while she and her family prayed for his resurrection . A sheriff had visited the property to evict the family, along with seven other adults that were living in the home, because their mortgage had fallen into foreclosure. Kaling and five of her children, ages 11 to 22, packed up the patriarch's shoes and bags in preparation for a move. When Kaling opened the bedroom door to retrieve her husband, the sheriff got his first whiff that something was wrong. Peter's had decomposed beyond recognition and had attracted rats in the bedroom, though Kaling had sealed the door and air vents to protect her family from the smell. His two feet protruded from the blankets Kaling had wrapped around him and secured with duct tape, while a cap was placed on his head. In court, Kaling remembers the sheriff finally told her 'OK that's enough, close the door.' The elder Wald suffered from diabetes and had developed an infection in his left foot, but would not go to the doctor, instead relying on God to provide the cure. Believers: The extremely religious family traveled in a van painted with messages about God and heaven and hell, and neighbors say they saw the family chanting in the back yard after Peter's death . Kaling said he slipped into a coma in March, but still she slept by his side. When she noticed signs of stomach bloat and rigor mortis days later, she sealed him in the bedroom and the family prayed for him to rise from the dead. 'It’s an extremely sad case … she truly believed her husband was going to be resurrected from the dead, even after six months,' assistant crown attorney Janet Booy said. Kaling's Christian devotion had 'tainted and warped her better judgment' according to Booy, and the family 'prayed on a daily basis for Peter to come back to life.' Superior Court Justice Marjoh Agro gave her a suspended sentence, ordering her to serve 18 months’ probation and seek counseling. 'Your belief that your husband would resurrect is not an issue,' Agro told her Monday. 'This is not about your religious beliefs. It is about your safety, the safety of your children and the safety of the community at large.' The CBC reports that homeowners noticed a change in the family's behavior around the time that Peter died. Next-door neighbor Brian Dennis says he saw the family dancing and chanting in the back yard while wearing black robes. He also saw flies at the bedroom window and birds pecking at the screen. When he and his wife Brenda asked about Peter's health, Kaling would only respond 'He’s in God’s hands now.' The family's blue van, painted with religious messages such as, 'You must make a choice heaven or hell,' had been parked outside the home for years, but one night neighbors saw the family painting over it with rollers. In spite of the odd behavior, residents say they were sad to have missed a chance to bid a proper farewell. 'He’d fix kids’ bikes. He’d cut people’s grass,' Brenda said. 'And now no one can say goodbye.'","Kaling Wald, 50, pleaded guilty to not notifying authorities of her husband Peter's death .

"A bungling thief was caught stealing from a bandit after being forced to take off his makeshift disguise of a binbag because he couldn't see what he was doing. Daniel Dzieliski, 38, had been trying to rob the one-armed bandit in Biala Podlaska, a city in the eastern Poland, when he spotted CCTV cameras in the room. Nipping out, he went to a nearby shop where he bought bin liners to hide his head and aluminium foil to put over the cameras. Scroll down for video . The burglar walked into the room where he spotted the one-armed bandit and the security cameras which prompted him to go to a nearby shop to buy a disguise . He then returned with a makeshift disguise of a balaclava made out of binbags, but then had trouble being able to see what he was doing . But after realising he would not be able to cover the cameras with foil with his head covered he took the bag off and tried putting foil over the camera lenses - and was filmed in the process. When the foil kept falling off, he tried hiding his face in his hands. Police spokesman Jaroslaw Janicki said: 'It was all quite comical, really. 'He first went into the room with nothing on his head and inspected the slot machines. 'He then left and returned with the bin liner over his head and tried covering the cameras up. He then decides to take off the binbag, revealing himself to the CCTV cameras, allowing police to establish his identity . In a bid to try and hide himself, he covers his face with his hands but it is too late as police were able to identify him as 38-year-old Daniel Dzieliski . 'But when the foil kept falling off because he couldn't see what he was doing, he took the bag off his head and tried covering his face with his hands. 'It was like watching a comedy. 'But we identified him immediately because he is well-known to us. 'In November he was arrested for stealing £2,000 from another fruit machine.'

"A high school student has died after a friend moved a hunting rifle in the back of his truck and the gun accidentally went off, shooting the teen dead. Jaden Rahm, 16, was driving three school friends to get lunch at one of their houses in Yuma, Colorado on Monday when the boy in the seat behind him moved the gun used for duck hunting. The rifle went off and the round went through the driver's seat, hitting Rahm in the torso, Sheriff Chad Day told the Denver Channel. Yuma Police received a call about the shooting at 11.58am just south of Yuma High School's campus. The sheriff's office announced his death that afternoon. Tragic: Jayden Rahm, 16, was accidentally shot dead when a friend moved a gun in his car as they headed for lunch on Monday. He was driving his parents' car and the gun was used for bird hunting . Star: The 16-year-old sophomore was remembered by friends as a great athlete and a gentleman . Authorities said the three other teenagers in the car at the time are not considered suspects. No one else was injured. Sheriff Day told the Denver Channel that it's common for people to leave their guns in their trucks during hunting season. Jaden had been driving his family's work truck at the time. 'There is still some forensic evidence that needs to be processed and an autopsy needs to be performed, but evidence points to this being a tragic accident,' the department said in a statement. It is unlikely any charges will be filed, they said. Rahm, a sophomore, played varsity baseball and hoped to be a farmer. Missed: The teenager, pictured with relatives, was just south of his school's campus when he was killed . On Monday night, a large crowd gathered for a candlelit vigil and remembered the teenager as a gentleman and someone who always tried to cheer people up. 'He was the one who brought us all together,' Kyli Blach, a sophomore, said. 'His blue eyes would sparkle and you'd have to smile, he would almost force you to smile.' Counseling services are being offered to students and families at the school. Friends and classmates posted the initials 'JR' across their social media pages to pay tribute to the young student. The Yuma County Sheriff's Office said the boy's family does not wish to make a statement.","Jaden Rahm was driving three friends to get lunch on Monday when one of the boys moved a gun in the back of the car and it went off .

"A British teenager died on a university study visit to Germany after her drink was allegedly spiked at a carnival. Jane Khalaf, 19, was rushed to hospital and put on a life-support machine but she never recovered and died eight days later. Ecstasy and amphetamines were found in her system. Her distraught parents said she was vehemently anti-drugs and her friends said she never took them. Jane Khalaf collapsed and died after telling friends that someone had spiked her drink during a carnival she went to while on exchange in Germany . They have accused German police of failing to investigate Jane’s death properly and of keeping them in the dark. Their MP, Barry Sheerman, raised the case in the Commons yesterday, saying: ‘A young girl in my constituency has been tragically murdered in Cologne. There is no police investigation although there is every evidence that her drink was spiked – she was poisoned.’ The politics and history student at Northumbria University had completed only six weeks of her course in western Germany when she died on November 20. She had been on a night out with friends at the city’s annual carnival. Her family is planning legal action against the police and the hospital where their daughter was treated. They didn’t tell us anything,’ said Jane’s mother Rojin, 40. ‘They said they weren’t interested and wouldn’t be looking into the case. ‘It’s like my daughter doesn’t matter to them. It is disgraceful and we have been shown no compassion by them. We still don’t know what happened that night.’ Her parents have hit out at German authorities after they were only informed of her illness through Facebook . Floral tributes have been laid outside her home in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire by family and friends . She said the hospital – the Cologne City Clinic – took six days to tell them what had happened to their ‘brilliant and ambitious’ daughter and initially failed to take blood tests even though Jane told them her drink had been spiked. Mrs Khalaf added: ‘When I saw her in hospital we were beside ourselves. No one can prepare a parent for this.’ Jane’s father, Khalil, 57, who owns a restaurant in their hometown of Huddersfield, said: ‘My daughter was so anti-drugs. Yes, she was 19, but she was sensible.’ Jane’s best friend Charlotte Lewis, who flew out to Germany with the family, said: ‘Jane couldn’t have been more against drugs. She would stay away from people she knew who were meddling with stuff like that. Her parents paid tribute to their 'angel' daughter today, who they said was 'intelligent, ambitious and funny' Miss Khalaf was attending a carnival in Cologne (pictured) when she told of fears her drink had been spiked . ‘A few weeks before she died she sent me a text saying she was worried one her friends in Cologne was doing drugs. She hated to see what they turned people into.’ Miss Khalaf’s body has been flown back to the UK where a post-mortem examination will be carried out. The teenager had a sister, 16-year-old Naze, and a brother Kevin, nine. Their parents fled unrest in Syria in 1978. A spokesman for Northumbria University said: ‘We can confirm that one of our students has tragically passed away while studying at a partner university in Germany.’ Prosecutors in Germany say an investigation has been carried out and they are due to receive a file on the case today. Miss Khalaf's was a student at Northumbria University and travelled to Cologne to study on exchange .","Successful student had been on exchange in Germany for just two months .

"It really is a dram fine tweed. Two of Scotland's iconic brands - Johnnie Walker Black Label and Harris Tweed Hebrides - have collaborated to create a 'fabric of flavour', where the material smells of whisky. The aroma will even be able to withstand dry cleaning. The tweed is said to have key notes of 'rich malt, golden vanilla, red fruit and the trademark dark chocolate tones.' Scroll down for video . Two of Scotland's iconic brands - Johnnie Walker Black Label and Harris Tweed Hebrides - have collaborated to create a 'fabric of flavour' Months of development work, also involving Heriot Watt University, have resulted in a Harris Tweed design is supposed to reflect the colours of the whisky ingredients, while the fabric carries a unique scent - named Aqua Alba - based on the 'key notes of the nose of the liquid'. Donald Macka, heads the finishing department at the Harris Tweed Hebrides mill in Shawbost, Isle of Lewis. It is the biggest maker of the Clo Mhor - meaning 'big cloth' in Gaelic - whose devotees include former Dr Who Matt Smith, Madonna and Gwyneth Paltrow. Mr Macka said: 'I have worked with aromas in the past but they were only meant to withstand one dry clean. 'The process we have devised for Johnnie Walker means that this scent is layered into the fabric throughout the finishing process and is permanently imbued in the tweed'. Jim McVee, business development manager at Heriot Watt's School of Textiles and Design, said: 'Smart textiles are a fast-developing sector that offers enormous potential. Our brief was to assist Harris Tweed Hebrides with the development of a tweed for Johnnie Walker that incorporates a micro-encapsulated fragrance. Whisky aficionados will now be able to wrap up warm while simultaneously surrounding themselves with the smell of their favorite tipple . 'Fabric technologists in Galashiels developed the prototypes which will enable Harris Tweed Hebrides to offer products using this technology in future. Mark Hogarth, creative director for Harris Tweed Hebrides, said that the idea stemmed from a shared recognition that premium Scotch Whisky and Harris Tweed have much in common in terms of 'provenance, complexity of the process and quality of finished blend'. A range of products using Johnnie Walker Harris Tweed and the scent will be marketed around Europe starting with Germany, Greece and Belgium. The makers claim that the whisky aromas are infused into the cloth and can withstand dry cleaning . The chairman of Harris Tweed Hebrides, former UK Trade Minister, Brian Wilson believes that the new material will be of great benefit to the Scottish economy. He said: 'This is a very natural partnership of two great Scottish brands with input from one of our cutting-edge academic centres. 'The more of these partnerships we can promote, the better for the Scottish economy. 'The early indications are that the finished products are creating a high level of interest in the target markets'.","Material is partnership between Johnnie Walker and Harris Tweed Hebrides .

"A glamour model has spoken of how her career was shattered in an instant when she was paralysed in a freak accident while out clubbing. Lolly Mack, 40, from North London, was left in a wheelchair and with severely limited movement in her upper body when a fellow clubber high on drink and drugs fell from a balcony and landed directly on top of her. She said: ‘I didn't want to live at . first after being told I would need 24 hour care, using a catheter and . being washed and dressed. Lolly Mack, 40, a former glamour model, was paralysed from the neck down when a man fell from a balcony and landed on top of her in a nightclub in London in 2004 . ‘But my family said “let's fight this until one day you get back on your feet again”. From that day I just thought that is it! Fight it will be!’ She is now on a huge fundraising drive to raise funds into spinal research in the hope like people such as her will one day be able to walk again. Ms Mack, who was just 30 at the time, was in a nightclub in Central London in 2004 when Philip Brady, who had been taking ecstasy and drinking heavily, landed on top of her. She says she felt a sudden ‘thud’ on her neck and shoulders and fell to the ground as she was hit by the 6ft 3ins man. 'My initial thought was that I'd been punched and I remember falling backwards,' she says. 'But when I hit the floor I knew something was dreadfully wrong as I could do nothing other than blink. Ms Mack, who was 30 at the time of the accident, suffered a broken neck and her spinal cord was compressed. She had emergency surgery to stabilise her neck and then spent ten months in rehabilitation (pictured) Ms Mack (pictured in hospital) has regained some of the movement in her arms but she is still unable to move her legs or her wrists and hands. She says she has lost her independence and needs carers to help her wash and dress . 'My friends were encouraging me to get up, but I became increasingly distressed as I realised I couldn't.' Ms Mack, who appeared on MTV as well a model in various national newspapers,  was rushed to King's College Hospital in south London, where she underwent six hours of emergency surgery to stabilise her neck. She was told her neck had been broken and her spinal cord compressed. She told MailOnline: 'I think there was something telling me not to go out that night - I didn't really want to go and my gut feeling was that I shouldn't. 'But I didn't want to let my boyfriend down so I went anyway.' She added: 'I knew immediately something was terribly wrong when I was lying on the floor. It was completely terrifying. 'The first thing I asked the paramedics was if I was going to be in a wheelchair but they said it was too soon to say. Ms Mack (pictured, left, before the accident) says that when she realised the extent of her injuries she initially thought she did not want to live any more . Ms Mack (pictured with friends) now focuses on raising awareness of spinal injuries and on raising money for research into a cure for these injuries . 'Being in the hospital was daunting - it was like a scene from Casualty. I knew by that point that it was quite serious.' The day after her injury, Ms Mack was moved to Stoke Mandeville Hospital, in Buckinghamshire, where she spent 10 months in rehabilitation. When she arrived at the hospital she was unable to move anything other than her head. She said: 'I thought I couldn't live like that. I thought it was the end of my life. I was crying buckets. 'I was not accepting it, I didn't want to hear about it and I was in denial. I think most people feel suicidal in that position. It was awful.' Ms Mack (pictured in rehabilitation) says her dream is to eventually walk again and to regain her independence . Despite the treatment and a strict exercise regime, she only regained some of the movement in her arms and none of the movement in her legs. And while she can now move her arms a little, she is still unable to move her wrists or her hands. She lives with her family and has carers who come in every day to help her wash and dress. She also suffers from neuropathic pain - pain caused by a problem with the signals from the nerves - 24 hours a day, from the shoulders down. Mr Brady was found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm and was jailed for two years. Ms Mack told MailOnline: 'I don't let him ruin my life - I don't think about it. He was never really apologetic but I don't wish bad upon him and I don't want to be ruined by anger. Philip Brady, the man who fell on Ms Mack, was found guilty of causing GBH and was jailed for two years . 'I do sometimes wonder what I did to deserve it, you think ""why me?"". 'I had so many gut instincts telling me not to go out but I ignored them - it happened and there is nothing I can do about that now.' She now dedicates her time to raising awareness of spinal cord injuries and to raising money for research into a cure. She said: 'My hope and my dream is getting back on my feet and regaining my independence. 'We rely on as much money being raised as possible - it is all about finding a cure. 'I live my life to the fullest I can - I love travelling, beauty, and I have even met a new guy which I am really happy about. Ms Mack (pictured in hospital) says she does her best to live life to the full despite her injury . 'I am trying to have as many fun, happy times as possible while waiting for a cure. 'I can still have fun and enjoy life and be grateful that I wasn't killed but I have great hope as I know it's not a case of if we find a cure, it's a case of when.' On May 31 Ms Mack will be holding an event in Central London to raise money for the charity Spinal Research. Tickets are on sale for £60 and the party will be held at the Yager Bar near St Paul's Cathedral where there will be champagne, canapes and performances from a range of musicians.

"A 15-year-old schoolgirl who died after falling from a historic monument following an argument with her boyfriend sent him a text message in which she threatened to 'jump off the tower' prior to her death, an inquest heard. Ashli Blake, who was born with the surname Cook, was found dead by her boyfriend Marcus Webb on land close to a historic monument, near Rockbourne, Hampshire, in the early hours of September 21. At an inquest into her death today, the coroner heard how the schoolgirl sent a text message to Mr Webb, who was five years her senior, prior to her death in which she threatened to kill herself. The message read: 'I am going to jump off the tower. If we can't be together, I don't want to be here anymore. Bye.' Ashli Blake, 15, was  found dead in a field next to a historic monument in Hampshire on September 21 . At an inquest into her death today, the coroner heard how Ashli, 15, sent a text message to her boyfriend Marcus Webb (pictured together above) prior to her death in which she threatened to 'jump off the tower' The coroner was also told how she had suffered 'some bullying problems' at the Burgate School in Fordingbridge, in the lead up to her tragic death. A post-mortem examination found that she died of multiple injuries, the inquest at Winchester Coroner's Court was told. The inquest heard how Ashli had spent the day prior to her death with Mr Webb, but ended up storming out of his mother's home following an argument. The coroner was told she stormed out of the house yelling 'I'm going to f****** kill myself' following a row in which she accused him of trying to get close to one of her friends. Mr Webb, who discovered her body after launching a desperate search when he and her family failed to get hold of her, told how he had not believed her threats because she had made similar comments previously. In a statement read to the inquest, Mr Webb said: 'I feel so guilty and I feel like it was my fault, she told me she was going to kill herself and even told me where she was going to do it and I laughed at her because I didn't believe her. 'Ashli meant more than life itself to me, I would do nothing to hurt her, I now feel there's no reason being here.' Mr Webb said he had visited the tower several times with Ashli and it was where they had taken their photograph together when they started going out three years earlier. Her mother, Canasta Blake, 37, who has another daughter and a son, told how the young couple had made plans for the rest of their lives together. She said in a statement: 'They had made plans for the rest of their lives together - at 16 she was going to move in with him. 'She was besotted with him. She was always worried about him and what he was doing. 'I do not understand why she did this, she had everything to live for and often spoke of the future. An inquest into her death in Winchester heard she was battling bullying at school prior to her death . 'I think, for her age, she was immature, in her laughing, giggling and making up silly words. Ashli was a lovely young girl, was imaginative, different and quirky, she had her own special dress sense. 'She would have grown up to be a lovely person.' She said Ashli had suffered from some bullying problems with other girls at her school but she had not expressed any wish not to attend school because of it. Ms Blake added that Ashli was working hard at her studies and had told family members she wanted to become an art therapist or an accountant. Ashli's GP, Dr Charlotte Hillsley, at Fordingbridge Surgery, said she had suffered from low moods and sleeping problems. She had previously been referred to the Hampshire Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services but had been discharged. However, in July she had returned to the surgery and was referred again to the clinic and was placed on its waiting list. In a statement read to the inquest, Dr Hillsley said: 'Ashli had low mood and poor sleep and was struggling with bullying at school. 'Her mother had told me she had removed razor blades from the house and taken them to work with her because she was concerned that she may self-harm.' Ashli's mother Canasta Blake was supported at the inquest by her partner Craig Warrilow while pathologist Dr Eleanor Jaynes told the inquest the schoolgirl had taken no alcohol or drugs prior to her death . Deer stalker John Powell, who was out hunting near the monument on the night of Ashli's death, was the last person to see her alive. As he watched for deer with his rifle, he told the inquest that he spotted a young girl leaping over the stile into the field and walking towards the monument alone and with purpose. Pathologist Dr Eleanor Jaynes told the inquest the schoolgirl had taken no alcohol or drugs prior to her death and had died of multiple traumatic injuries due to a fall from a height. Central Hampshire Coroner Grahame Short recorded a verdict that she had intended to take her own life. He said: 'Ashli was a deeply troubled girl but I find that she chose to end her life on this occasion.' He added: 'It's clear that she had a boyfriend, Marcus Webb, and I find that she was very much in love with him to a degree that only a teenager can be.' In the wake of her death, staff at The Burgate School said they were 'shocked and saddened' to hear of the tragedy. A school spokesman said: 'We are shocked and saddened to hear the tragic news that one of our Year 11 students has died. 'Ashli was an absolutely delightful, caring and mature young lady. 'She was working hard at school and was very well regarded and respected by staff and students alike. 'The school is pulling together as a community and supporting each other. 'Our thoughts and prayers go out to Ashli's family at this most difficult time.'

"Forty years may have passed, but there is one topic that remains off-limits for Denis Law when discussing Manchester derbies. Law may be 74, but he is as sharp and engaging as ever in discussion. At a sponsor's event inside Old Trafford earlier this week, not far from where his statue stands outside the famous stadium, the conversation flows with the Manchester United hero until the subject of his controversial goal in the 1974 Manchester derby is raised. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Denis Law believes Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie are two of the world's best strikers . Rooney (centre) will return to Manchester United's starting line-up after serving his three-match ban . 'I can't remember it. I just can't remember it,' Law says, bluntly. Whether time has erased any memory of the goal or Law is just being evasive, the Scot does not want to talk about it - and it is easy to see why. United fans labelled Law 'The King of Old Trafford' after scoring 237 goals, but on April 27, 1974 he was booed off by the home crowd at that famous ground after scoring against his former team for City. In what was the penultimate game of a nightmare season for United, the then 34-year-old backheeled Francis Lee's square pass beyond Alex Stepney to hand Manchester City a 1-0 win. United needed a win to keep their hopes of survival alive. Other results meant they would have gone down anyway - but in the eyes of the home fans, the King had relegated his old club. Law did not celebrate and was immediately substituted. Law may have tried to forget it, but on Sunday when Louis van Gaal's United head to the Etihad Stadium, the former striker will be made aware of the goal again by the fans in blue. 'Occasionally City fans try to remind me of it,' Law said with a wry smile. Law's back-heel finish, while playing for Man City against Man United, condemned the Red Devils to their fate . Law was mobbed by City fans after he scored against United which resulted in his former side's relegation . Law (centre) formed a formidable partnership with George Best (left) and Sir Bobby Charlton (right) - the trio are thought of so highly at United that the Holy Trinity have a statue at Old Trafford . Law made his name at United as part of a Holy Trinity which included three of the best players ever to grace the Old Trafford turf. Sir Bobby Charlton and George Best, who both used to describe Law's play as 'electric', completed the three-pronged attack. United's modern-day equivalent comprises Robin van Persie, Radamel Falcao and Wayne Rooney. Rooney has been missing for the last three games through suspension, so Law is delighted the 29-year-old captain will return for Sunday's game. 'It's an incredible boost to have Rooney back,' Law added. 'He and Van Persie are two of the best strikers in the world really. I would love to play with them.' As far as compliments go, that is probably as good as any Manchester United player will get. Law has been a fan of Rooney since he signed for United a decade ago. The Scot has watched the England captain inch closer and closer to his tally of 237 goals for the club. Rooney is now just 18 short of Law, who is second in the all-time scorers list behind the 249-goal Sir Bobby Charlton. Law is convinced Rooney will surpass his total this season and then go on to reach Charlton's landmark. 'I am sure he can (pass my total) it this season,' Law said. 'And stay away from injuries he will be the highest scorer in Manchester United's history.' United are confident of victory having watched their opponents across town go three matches without a win. Rooney will be Manchester United's highest scorer if he stays away from injuries, says Law . Law believes Louis van Gaal's side are starting to find some form after their topsy-turvy start to the season . Van Gaal's men also snatched a creditable draw against the all-conquering Chelsea last weekend, but Law does not think that necessarily means the visitors will come away with anything on Sunday. 'United played well and got a good result against Chelsea, but the derby game is another game altogether,' he added. 'Derby games could go any way. It's not always the best team who wins the game.' That said, Law thinks United are heading in the right direction under Van Gaal, who has won just three of his eight matches in charge. 'I feel momentum is building,' Law said. 'It's always a bit difficult when a new manager comes in, you have to get to know the players. It's not easy. 'It's very rare that you would settle in straight away. Once he gets what he wants as a team and the way it plays you will see the rewards and it will get better and better, guaranteed.' Law hopes Van Gaal can provide him with a derby result he will want to remember rather than forget on Sunday. Denis Law was speaking at the unveiling of the 'Treble Collection' and customised First Team squad watches by Bulova, Manchester United's Official Timekeeping partner.","Denis Law is glad Wayne Rooney is fit for Sunday's Manchester derby .

"Want to learn how to have safe and healthy anal sex? Simply enroll in Harvard University, one of the most prestigious colleges in the world. The school, which is number two in the nation, offered a seminar on anal sex on Tuesday aimed at promoting a holistic understanding of that specific type of intercourse despite the fact that it is widely considered taboo. The student run workshop called 'What What in the Butt: Anal Sex 101' is a part of Harvard's annual Sex Week, a week of programming meant to help students better understand all its parts, even those less discussed. Top school: The prestigious Harvard University is offering a class on anal sex as part of it's fourth annual student run Sex Week aimed at giving students a holistic sexual education . Those who attended the class were able to learn, 'anal anatomy and the potential for pleasure for all genders; how to talk about it with a partner; basic preparation and hygiene; lubes, anal toys, and safer sex; anal penetration for beginners, and much more!' says Harvard's Sex Week site. The course description says that the class will delve into the misunderstandings of anal sex and will be an opportunity for students to ask questions in a safe, comfortable, and knowledgeable environment. 'Come learn everything about anal sex from the experts of Good Vibrations, a sex-positive store located right in Brookline!' reads the  description posted on the official Harvard Sex Week website. 'They will dispel myths about anal sex and give you insight into why people do it and how to do it well.' RT.com reports that this year's Sex Week is the school's fourth ever and is run by Sexual Health Education & Advocacy throughout Harvard College, or SHEATH. The group describes itself as being, 'dedicated to empowering the Harvard community to explore their experiences with love and sex by providing comprehensive programming addressing a wide range of issues relating to sex, relationships, dating, sexual health, and sexuality.' The week long workshop will provide students with condoms and other materials provided by 'the world's largest pleasure product company' California Exotic Novelties. Safe environment: The  class will delve into the misunderstandings of anal sex and will be an opportunity for students to ask questions in a safe, comfortable, and knowledgeable environment . 'We’re always honored to support Harvard Sex Week and everything that SHEATH does throughout the year,' said the company's CEO Susan Colvin. 'We share a common goal: helping people learn and understand sexual wellness,' she said in a statement. Some students are looking forward to the workshop but like any controversial topic they face critics who are offended by the subject matter. One student at Harvard named Molly Wharton told The College Fix she feels as though the classes during Sex Week are 'downright vulgar.' 'I can’t imagine that there are not more worthwhile educational programs and initiatives to which Harvard’s resources should be devoted,' she added. SHEATH's co-president Kirin Gupta defended the workshop to a reporter from MTV.com. 'Saying we don’t need [the workshop] is like saying we don’t need sex education, or should have abstinence-only education, or that people should feel ashamed for doing whatever it is that’s part of their sexual practice,' he said. 'The conservative backlash speaks to the latent homophobia that society thinks so often it has gotten over, and has not. It speaks to these residual prejudices that people [have] when faced with a reality they’re not willing to acknowledge or respect,' he added.","The student run workshop called 'What What in the Butt: Anal Sex 101' is a part of Harvard's fourth  annual student run Sex Week .

"The prosecution of an experienced journalist for investigating alleged corruption by an MP has the ‘hallmark of oppressive regimes’, a court heard yesterday. Nick Parker, The Sun’s Chief Foreign Correspondent, is accused of looking at texts and emails on MP Siobhain McDonagh’s mobile phone after it was stolen from her car. He had been told there was evidence of ‘criminality’ on it including messages about ‘bribery’. Mr Parker, 53, is also accused of paying a policeman for information which led to stories about how officers merely cautioned then England football captain John Terry’s mother after a £1,450 shoplifting spree and pop star Ronnie Wood when he assaulted his girlfriend. Yesterday Trevor Burke QC, defending Parker, told the Old Bailey it is the ‘very basic right’ of a journalist to ‘expose hypocrisy’ Yesterday Trevor Burke QC, defending Parker, told the Old Bailey it is the ‘very basic right’ of a journalist to ‘expose hypocrisy’. He said Mr Parker went to look at the MP’s phone – which he believed had been left on a train – after being told that there was evidence of ‘criminality’. After realising the texts were clearly a joke he did not run a story and told a tipster he must hand the phone into the police. But Mr Parker is now standing trial accused of aiding and abetting misconduct in a public office, handling stolen goods and securing unauthorised access to computer material. Yesterday, in his closing submission to the jury, Mr Burke said: ‘On any level and on every level this is a disturbing and worrying case where a journalist who only reports the news honestly, accurately and fearlessly is prosecuted in a criminal court. ‘From the perspective of Nick Parker that is exactly what is happening today. ‘You are all familiar with journalists who have been silenced by the courts in the past and it has been the hallmark of oppressive regimes.’ He told jurors: ‘The 12 of you are invited to shoot the messenger simply for being an accurate and truthful messenger.’ Two stories provided by policeman Alan Tierney about Wood and Mr Terry’s mother were ‘plainly in the public interest’, the QC added. Tierney previously admitted misconduct in public office and has now left the force, the court was told. Mr Parker, from Twickenham in South West London, denies all the charges. The trial continues.

"Two women have been arrested for allegedly robbing bikini-clad baristas at gunpoint at a coffee shop in Portland, Oregon. Acacia Bowers, 29, and Lacey Preston, 30, are charged with robbery, unlawful use of a weapon and possession of meth after police say they held up workers at Twin Perks Espresso last fall.

Accused: Acacia Bowers, 29, right, and Lacey Preston, 30, left,are charged with robbery, unlawful use of a weapon and possession of meth after police say they held up workers at Twin Perks Espresso last fall . The footage, obtained by KATU.com, shows one of the women walking up to the coffee counter and pulling a gun on a barista at the drive-thru before making off with a wad of cash. The second woman then pulled up at the stand in a vehicle and pretended to be a concerned patron who offered to call 911, police said. But the emergency call was never made prompting investigators to conclude the woman was an accomplice trying to buy the robber getaway time. Surveillance cameras caught the car's license plate and detectives were able to identify the women.

"A McDonald's customer spotted a horde of mice feasting on leftover burgers and chips outside one of the chain's restaurants. James Jarvis, 26, saw the rodents scurrying near the bins of the fast-food store as he approached the drive-through in Tyburn, Birmingham on Saturday night. The factory worker, who had stopped to pick up a meal on his way home from his son's fifth birthday party, was so shocked that he took photos of the mice to show McDonald's staff. James Jarvis, 26, took these photos showing mice scurrying near the bins of a McDonald's restaurant in Tyburn, Birmingham . Mr Jarvis spotted around seven of the rodents as he visited the restaurant's drive-through on Saturday night . The factory worker said he saw about seven of them coming out of a gated area as he approached the drive-through window . McDonald's has since blamed the mice on 'extensive' roadworks taking place nearby. Mr Jarvis, from Edrington, Birmingham, said: 'We spotted one of them as we were coming up to the first drive-through window. 'Before we knew it there were five, six, seven of them coming out from a gated area. It was disgusting. 'I'm not sure if that's where they keep the bins but it's not right to have mice roaming around near a fast food restaurant where there are kids about. 'I mentioned it to the young assistant at the window and she said the manager knew about the problem and had put traps down. 'I told her it clearly wasn't working and wasn't good enough.' McDonald's has blamed the mice on roadworks taking place near to the restaurant and says the store has increased the number of traps on site (pictured) As well as providing more traps, a spokesman for the chain said it has increased litter patrols around the restaurant and requested weekly inspections . The McDonald's branch is near an £11million road improvement project which is aiming to reduce congestion on a busy stretch of the Chester Road, which is used by 40,000 vehicles a day. A McDonald's spokesman said the company had increased the number of traps, litter patrols and inspections at and around the restaurant. He said: 'We can assure our customers that cleanliness and hygiene are a priority for us and we adhere to high standards with independent, strict and regular audits to ensure food safety. 'There is currently extensive roadworks taking place in close proximity to our restaurant and on occasion, pests have been sighted in the area disturbed by the development works. 'We continue to work closely with our contractors to monitor the area. A spokesman said the restaurant was visited last week by Environmental Health and that  there was no evidence of pest activity inside the store . 'We have increased litter patrols around the restaurant, requested weekly inspections and provided more traps. 'The restaurant was visited last week by Environmental Health that observed there was no evidence of pest activity inside the store.' In Birmingham last year, there were more than 5,100 sightings of rodents recorded. City pest control officer Colin Watts said in March that he had even seen a rat the size of a cat in Bordesley Green. He said: 'One of the biggest I've seen must have been 14 or 15 inches long. That was just the body, without the tail. With its tail it would have been over 2ft. It was like a small cat.'","James Jarvis, 26, visited drive-through in Tyburn, Birmingham on Saturday .

"It is meant to be a delightfully sweet and tasty treat, but the Duffin, a doughnut - muffin hybrid, has left a very bitter taste in one pastry chef's mouth, after Starbucks trademarked the name. Bea Vo, owner of Bea's of Bloomsbury, has been selling her Duffins from her four London bakeries for over two years. She was shocked to learn that high street coffee giants Starbucks had launched it's own version of the snack and registered the name. Caked off: The owner of London's Bea's bakery  is furious after Starbuck's trademarked the name 'Duffin' The Bea's of Bloomsbury Duffin uses a . buttermilk and nutmeg batter which is baked and stuffed with raspberry . jam before being dipped in melted butter and then dusted with sugar. The . Starbucks version, which was developed by their pastry suppliers Rich's Products also uses nutmeg and buttermilk and is injected with . raspberry jam, however it foregoes the butter dip process. She told ABC news: 'I didn't really . give it too much thought until I found out their version of the duffin . also contains raspberry jam, nutmeg and buttermilk. 'My . recipe, which was published in my cookbook back in August 2011, is the . only one out there to carry all of those traits. Doughnut muffins have . been around for a while, Nigella Lawson even has them in her first . cookbook -- but the style of mine, that is what makes it unique. 'What makes a Duffin characteristic is . that it's dipped in melted butter and then rolled in sugar. The . Starbucks version doesn't even bother with the dipping in melted butter. By all accounts it isn't even a true doughnut-muffin -- it's a . jam-filled muffin.' Ms Vo has described theirs as being an inferior version of her recipe. In a statement Starbucks' vice-president for marketing and category Ian Cranna, said: 'Since launching, we have discovered there are other Duffins out there in the UK, including at Bea's of Bloomsbury… however we'd like to make it clear that neither Starbucks nor Rich's Products has suggested to Bea's of Bloomsbury that they will attempt to stop them selling their own Duffins.' The Starbuck's Duffin (left) uses a very similar recipe to the Bea's of Billingham Duffin (right) However Starbucks said they had no idea that other Duffins were being sold or that anyone was using the name. They claimed to have conducted an 'extensive' online search as well as a full trademark search for the name but had drawn a blank. 'Inspired by our muffins, we sat together with our bakers and pondered how you could make a muffin go one step further,' their marketing department claimed. However Ms Vo remains entirely unconvinced, pointing out that a quick google search will reveal dozens of refernces and recipes for Duffins, including her own. She told the Independent: 'Starbucks maintains its original account that its invention is a unique invention and that it did an extensive online search for the word duffin and found nothing and as a result their supplier trademarked that name. I think that's rubbish. 'I would love to see  the emails between Starbucks and Rich's Products during the birth of their invention.'","Bea's of Bloomsbury has been selling Duffins for over two years .

"A pet Siberian lynx attacked a woman who was feeding it in an affluent Atlanta neighborhood on Tuesday, landing her in the hospital with injuries to her head and raising questions about the right to raise exotic cats. The owners of the dangerous animal were out of town and made arrangements with the woman to care for their exotic pet, police said. Another woman called police to say her friend, 21-year-old Rachel Hightower, had been attacked by the large cat, which can weigh up to 90 pounds. The woman - identified only as Mackenzie, who had accompanied Hightower for the feeding - was heard in the 911 describing the attack. Scroll down for video . Scene: Police say this Siberian lynx - which is kept as a pet by a licensed owner - attacked a woman who entered its enclosure in Atlanta on Tuesday . Investigation: Police inspect the large enclosure in the backyard of a home in Buckhead, an affluent suburb of Atlanta. At least . Dangerous: There are at least nine exotic cats living on the property, four of which are Siberian lynxes . 'The next thing I know she is down on the ground and she is screaming,' the friend told the 911 operator, according to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. 'It was a Siberian Lynx and it was attacking her and it cut her head open and she's bleeding a lot.' When officers arrived in Buckhead, a posh suburb north of downtown Atlanta, the woman was bleeding heavily from her head. Hightower sustained claw injuries to her scalp and was taken to hospital. The animal's owner has a Georgia Department of Natural Resources wild animal breeding license and is in compliance with state law, according to Mark McKinnon from the agency's law enforcement division. The licensed owner, Fred Boyajian, has two serval cats, two caracal cats, one Canadian lynx, and four Siberian lynx, McKinnon said in an emailed statement. Police investigated the attack and said the owner has a Georgia Department of Natural Resources wild animal breeding license and is in compliance with state law . Emergency: The female victim was taken to hospital with head injuries . Owner: Fred Boyajian has had a Georgia Department of Natural Resources wild animal breeding license for over 30 years. He breeds the cats as a hobby but also sells them . The lynx was returned to its cage and local animal control officials were notified, said Atlanta police spokesman Greg Lyon. The lynx's caretaker, David Laws, told 11 Alive that Hightower had gone 'against protocol' by entering the cage. Laws said she was confused about the animal's feeding schedule and that the cat posed no threat to the community. 'On her own judgement, against protocol, she went into one of the cages for whatever reason,' he said. Boyajian  has been licensed by the Georgia DNR to raise exotic cats for more than three decades. Boyajian keeps the animals as a hobby but also sells them, mostly to zoos. Past problem: In 2004, this smaller Siberian lynx escaped from its enclosure and was found roaming the neighborhood . Dangerous: Siberian lynx's - also known as a Eurasian lynx - are native to the forests of Siberia and typically prey on small to large mammals, from birds to moose and reindeer . 'They are not house pets,' Boyajian said on his personal website. 'Although they can be very loving, they can also inadvertently be destructive and dangerous. 'We will not sell them to inexperienced owners, without permits, or for use as house pets.' In 2004 another Siberian Lynx belonging to Boyajian escaped its enclosure and was found roaming the streets. The cat, which weighed about 50 pounds, was caught and returned to its cage without incident.","Attack occurred around noon Tuesday at a property in Buckhead, Atlanta .

"Donor: Billionaire George Soros donated $33million to social justice groups which helped perpetuate the national debate over Ferguson . Liberal billionaire George Soros donated $33million to social justice organizations which helped turn events in Ferguson from a local protest into a national flashpoint. The handouts, revealed in tax filings from Soros's private foundation, were given to dozens of different groups which weighed in on the crisis. Organizers from professional groups in Washington, D.C., and New York were bussed into the Missouri town to co-ordinate messaging and lobby to news media to cover events using the billionaire's funding. The flood of donations were uncovered in an analysis of the latest tax return by Soros's Open Society Foundations by the Washington Times. The cash was reportedly funneled into keeping up numbers of protesters in the community over a period of months by bringing in outside activists. Meanwhile papers from think tanks were disseminated to bring in extra coverage of the civil unrest, also linked to the police killings of Eric Garner in Staten Island and Tamir Rice, 12, in Cleveland, Ohio. Outlets which covered the research, and the movements themselves, included one, Colorlines, which Soros himself has funded. The slew of organizations reportedly created their own online 'echo chamber', by using their extensive social media presences to 'like', repost and comment on articles putting across their point of view. The director of Soros's fund said that they have no direct control over the groups they give to, and said they are all trying to improve accountability. Bankrolled: Tax filings revealed that Soros pumped millions into groups that bussed protesters to Ferguson, Missouri, from around the country and co-ordinated campaigns to keep it in the media . He told the Washington Times: 'Helping groups combine policy, research [and] data collection with community organizing feels very much the way our society becomes more accountable. 'The incidents, whether in Staten Island, Cleveland or Ferguson, were spontaneous protests - we don’t have the ability to control or dictate what others say or choose to say.' The Soros cash was also put to work driving buzzwords and social media campaigns to propel Ferguson into the national consciousness. One recipient of his funding is the Organization for Black Struggle, which in turned established a group called the Hands Up Coalition, that has helped make ubiquitous the 'hands up, don't shoot' slogan. Unrest: Some of the groups Soros funded came up with slogans and social media campaigns to keep the event in the national consciousness . The words are reference to how contentious witness accounts describing how Michael Brown was raising his hands in surrender when Ferguson officer Darren Wilson shot him dead this August. Soros also gave money to the Drug Policy Alliance, which worked on the perpetuation of the 'black lives matter' buzz phrase, which has been incorporated into speeches by political figures including Hillary Clinton. The billionaire's fortune was made from speculating on financial markets, most notably making more than $1billion in the 1990s helping cripple the British financial system by speculation on the pound sterling. He is currently ranked at number 17 on the Forbes 400 richlist, with an estimated worth of $24billion.","Hedge fund mogul's Open Society Foundations made huge donations .

"Families have been spending more of their income on pleasure to try to escape the pressures of recession, an official report said yesterday. It found that we have been spending more on package holidays, televisions, hi-tech gadgets and sports tickets and less on food and soft drinks. The increase in the amounts devoted to leisure has come at a time when family budgets remain stressed, according to the annual Family Spending report from the Office for National Statistics. Scroll down for video . Families are spending increasing amounts of money on gadgets inside the home as the economy improves . The report said that last year a typical home was able to spend £517.30 a week, up £16.30 on 2012 levels. But, after allowing for inflation, this was over than £30 a week less than each household was able to spend before the recession struck, in 2006, and below spending levels of the early 2000s. According to the ONS spending measurements, charted in an annual survey of 5,000 homes, people have been turning to entertainment to try to compensate for their stagnant incomes. Last year an average family spent the biggest share of its income on paying for its home, and for fuel and power - £74.40 a week – as utility bills went up. The second category was transport, which took £70.40 out of a typical home’s budget. But next came spending in the area described by the ONS as recreation and culture, at £63.90 a week, 12 per cent of the average budget. The category includes TV and audio-visual equipment; computers; books and newspapers; sports, theatre and cinema tickets; package holidays, and pets and garden furniture. Report editor Giles Horsfield said it was ‘interesting that spending on recreation and culture has held up’ during the recession and added that a reason could be ‘desire for escapism’. More than a third of recreational spending in a typical home went on package holidays - £22.40 a week – while sport, cinema and TV subscriptions took up £18.60, and £2.20 on pet food. The urge to spend on items that may not be necessities was also apparent in the transport section of family spending. Transport spending went up, the ONS said, partly because people were buying more new cars. On average families devoted £8.30 a week to new vehicles. As well as holidays, families have been splashing out on the latest new technology such as mobile phones . ‘Purchasing new cars is an area where households could moderate or defer expenditure,’ the ONS said, ‘which may lead to demand building up over time. This is sometimes referred to as pent up demand. This may have fuelled the increase in sales of new cars seen in 2013, with consumers replacing vehicles they kept hold of through the recent downturn.’ The survey also found that people spent almost as much on air fares - £5.40 a week – as on rail, tube and bus fares put together, at £5.50 a week. Spending on food and non-alcoholic drink went downwards compared with rising interest in entertainment and the steep demands of energy, rent, bills and mortgages. The ONS said there were indications of a fall in spending on food, likely to be linked to families taking advantage of growing price competition between supermarkets. The survey showed that the average mortgage cost £145.40 a week, and families that rent typically paid £92.10 a week for their home. The poorest 10 per cent of homes spent just £189.80 on goods and services, well under a fifth of the £1,119.50 spending of the wealthiest tenth of households. The wealthiest parts of the country were the South East, which over the past three years had typical household spending of £585.40 a week, and London, spending for each home on average £579.60. Lowest spending was in the North East, at £424.60 a week. In Scotland average family spending over three years was £449.00, and in Wales £438.50. The report noted that spending reached £539.80 in 2006, ‘and started declining, just before the economic downturn’. In 2007 average household spend was £531.70 at 2013 prices, and reached bottom level at £501 in 2012. The decline in family spending is fresh evidence that many incomes were strained before the onset of the recession in 2008. Last month a report from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation found that poverty among people who have jobs began to rise in 2004. Some analysts believe pressure on wages and incomes began to rise in 2004 and 2005 when more than a million Eastern European workers began to arrive in Britain, many to compete for low-paid jobs.","Families are spending more money on package holidays and gadgets .

"When it’s cold outside there’s something irresistible about a warm, fluffy jumper. Never more so than this season, as these sweaters are the height of fashion, lining the rails of every clothes shop on the British High Street. Some of these snuggly knits are made from cashmere, others from merino wool or mohair. But there is one fibre that is softer and fluffier than all the rest: angora. These sought-after knits are produced from the fur of the angora rabbit — giant balls of fluff with tiny faces peeking out, bred for their long, soft wool. Scroll down for video . Factory horror: An angora rabbit is tied up by its feet and its skin stretched as it is being cut with an electric shear . Angora fibres are hollow, which gives clothes a fluffy texture. It’s warmer than wool and the fibre is also exceptionally fine — just 11 microns (11 thousandths of a millimetre) in diameter — which means angora is softer than cashmere. It is also far cheaper than the luxury fabric, with angora jumpers on sale in Topshop for £36 and scarves in John Lewis for just £30. But an investigation this week revealed these bargain knits may be coming at an immense cost to the animals that produce this fluffy angora wool. The images, taken at an undisclosed location in China, shows angora rabbits in cages . The rabbit is bent across the woman's knee before being trimmed of its fur using scissors . Animal rights group PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) released a gut-wrenching exposé into the angora industry in China, which is responsible for 90 per cent of the world’s supply of angora wool. Investigators went to ten different angora farms and witnessed, they say, appalling abuse of animals at all ten locations. At half of the farms a particularly barbaric form of live plucking is used to remove the fur. PETA, which is campaigning for shoppers to boycott angora, is not naming the farms to protect its sources, but has documented its hard-hitting findings in video footage. Be warned, neither the still images nor the video make for easy viewing. The woman holds the rabbit by the ears while trimming its fur at the Chinese angora farm . Shocking truth: The animals are constantly injured from throughout the plucking as they struggle to break free . Torture: The Chinese fur traders use the plucking technique as it results in better quality fur and more money . Terrified white rabbits, screaming with fear, are stretched prone on wooden boards and held by the neck while that much-prized soft fur is plucked by hand — though scalped might be a more appropriate term. Hair is wrenched from the follicles until only raw, pink skin remains. In other scenes, the defenceless creatures are tethered with rope by the front and back legs while they are sheared by men armed with metal scissors, who pay little attention to the cuts they are inflicting on the animals. There can be little doubt that in this footage, rabbits are treated in a horrifying manner. ‘After their fur is yanked out, the gentle, sensitive rabbits are left in shock, able only to lie motionless inside their tiny, filthy cages,’ says PETA spokesman Ben Williamson. Animal cruelty: The angora rabbits are alive throughout the plucking and are kept for several years, plucked every few months, before their throats are slit . Locked up: The cages injure the rabbit's feet and the insanitary conditions see many of them, such as this one, suffer infections and illness . Rather than simply trimming the fur with clippers, as many breeders do, the factory workers are seen wrenching the fur from the root, causing the rabbits incredible pain.  The reason for this cruelty? Simple economics — and expedience. Angora has a trade value of £22 to £28 per kilogram, but the longer hair that comes from plucking, as opposed to shearing, can sell for more than double that. As for speed, one only needs to watch the footage to discover how quick removing the hair in this manner is. Angora breeders in the UK told the Mail that plucking a rabbit without causing harm takes up to two weeks of gently removing loosened hair, not the minutes it takes to rip hunks of fur from a terrified animal in the factories visited in China. Shearing a rabbit takes up to an hour when done with care — but again, the process recorded on these videos was terrifyingly swift. This process is repeated every three months for the two to three years of the animal’s life. Angoras can live for five years, or even as long as ten years when well looked after, but farmed rabbits have a much shorter lifespan, which can be as little as two years. Yet it is not just the manner in which these animals — which are more commonly kept as pets in Britain — have their fur harvested that has sparked animal welfare concerns. Pictures show forlorn looking rabbits with tattered and partially shaved fur cowering in tiny cages in half-covered sheds. Pain and suffering: The terror in the animal's eyes is unmistakeable as a worker with a Chinese angora trader stretches it out and yanks out its fur . ‘The rabbits are kept in tiny filthy cages, surrounded by their own waste,’ says Mr Williamson. ‘The cages offer little protection from the elements. They are forced to spend their entire miserable lives standing on the thin cage wires that constantly cut into their sensitive footpads, never having a chance to dig, jump or run around.’ Once the rabbit’s health fails, they are of little use to breeders. Those who survive the brutal conditions in these rabbit farms are killed by having their necks broken, and are hung upside down and have their throats slit before their flesh is sold to local markets, PETA says. There are thought to be more than 50 million rabbits on angora farms in China, producing more than  4,000 tonnes of fur a year. Left to recover: After the rabbit had had all its fur yanked out it is thrown into a cage to regrow its fur in complete solitude . It is by far the world’s biggest producer, followed by Argentina, Chile, the Czech Republic and Hungary, which produce the bulk of the remaining 10 per cent of the supply chain. While plucking of angora rabbits does occur in other countries, the Mail has not found any reports of the particularly barbaric form witnessed in these Chinese factories being employed elsewhere. There is no doubt that China has a woeful record of factory farming and animal cruelty, particularly when it comes to producing clothes for the fashion industry, many of which end up on sale on British High Streets. In 2009, campaigners exposed how down used in jackets and other items was being ripped from the bodies of live geese by Chinese suppliers. Two years later it emerged that raccoon dogs were being skinned while still alive to produce imitation sheepskin boots. No hope: This young bunny is in the process of regrowing its fur while recovering from an eye infection in a naked steel cage . In China, there are no penalties for the abuse of animals on farms and minimal, if any, standards to regulate their treatment. A new law was drafted in 2009, but has not been implemented. The UK once had its own angora industry, but it died out after World War II and now remains only as a cottage industry, with producers unable to compete with the cheap angora from eastern countries such as China. ‘We can’t compete with the Chinese, so it’s very much a niche market,’ says Sarah Paul, who breeds and produces angora on a small scale on her farm in North Yorkshire and has raised rabbits for the past 30 years. ‘I’m one of the few left, there are no commercial producers in the UK any more. As an animal, they are lovely and very easy to keep and the fibre is absolutely gorgeous.’ Her rabbits (all lovingly tended to, nails clipped, and coats combed) mostly live on the barn floor and are clipped, not plucked, every 14 to 16 weeks. Angora rabbits regularly moult, which allows breeders to harvest their hair in this manner. ‘That’s the most labour intensive part,’ says the mother-of-four. She says that, far from screaming and struggling to escape, the rabbits become quite ‘soporific’ as they are groomed and clipped, a  process that can take an hour for each one. If a rabbit is not clipped, she says, its fur can become matted, ‘almost imprisoning’ the animal. Ms Paul, who runs Bigwigs Angora,  sells her rabbits’ fibres to independent wool spinners in small packs of nearly an ounce for £3. A single angora rabbit, well looked after, may produce about just over 1lb of fur a year from three to four clippings, which is blended with other fibres to make a 50 per cent angora yarn — enough to make two and a half jumpers. A single jumper would cost £64 to make with £8 balls of yarn, a far higher price than the mainstream fashion industry can tolerate with its insistence on large profit margins. On the British High Street, the Mail found angora products on sale in every store we visited, most of them displaying labels saying ‘Made in China’. While this doesn’t necessarily mean the wool was sourced in China, the vast majority of angora sold in Britain comes from that country. Of the retailers approached by the Mail — which included John Lewis, Topshop and H&M — only Marks & Spencer told us where they sourced their angora: China. Among the store’s offerings this season are a £39.50 roll-neck jumper, made from 38 per cent angora, and a three-quarter sleeve cardigan in the palest of pinks, made of  55 per cent angora, for £49.50. A spokesman said: ‘We put animal welfare at the heart of our business and are committed to the highest standards in all our supply chains, including angora wool.’ The store said live plucking did not meet their high welfare standards, while H&M also condemned the practice and Topshop said only shearing and combing were acceptable. ‘As a condition of doing business with us, all our suppliers must adhere to our strict animal welfare policies,’ said the M&S spokesman. While this may be the case for some stores, this week’s horrific images of rabbits will surely be enough to give many British shoppers pause for thought when they stop to stroke the fluffy angora jumpers on offer on our High Streets this winter.","Cruel methods at Chinese angora farm revealed by investigation .

"Armed pro-Russian militants have today raised their flags over official buildings in two eastern Ukrainian cities deepening a stand-off with Moscow, which Kiev warned, could drag Europe closer to the brink of a 'gas war'. In the regional capital of Donetsk the police chief quit his post as protestors - dressed in the uniforms of the now defunct Ukrainian riot-police - stormed the headquarters. They occupied the ground floor and hoisted the black and orange flag adopted by pro-Russian separatists over the building, in place of the Ukrainian flag. Kostyantyn Pozhydayev appeared on the steps of the police station to speak to the protestors, telling them he was stepping down 'in accordance with your demands'. As he left the building, he was accompanied by some of his officers. Members of the disbanded Ukraine's elite Berkut riot police, together with Russian separatists, enter the seized regional police headquarters in Donetsk today . A masked pro-Russian militant stands behind a barricade of tyres and concrete blocks in front of the regional building in the eastern Ukrainian capital of Donetsk . Hundreds of pro-Russian supporters join militants to barricade the state building as protestors force the regional police chief from his post . Witnesses in Donetsk said the men who entered the police building were wearing the uniforms of the Berkut, the feared riot police squad that was disbanded in February after Yanukovych's ouster. Berkut officers' violent dispersal of a demonstration in Kiev in November set off vast protests in the capital that culminated in bloodshed in February when more than 100 people died in sniper fire; the acting government says the snipers were police. It was not immediately clear if the men who occupied the Donetsk police building had made any demands. In Slaviansk, a town which lies about 90 miles from the border with Russia, at least 20 men armed with pistols and rifles were guarding the police station and a security services headquarters - another 20 men were said to be inside. They wore St. George's ribbons, which . have become a symbol of pro-Russian protesters in eastern Ukraine. The . ribbons were originally associated with the Soviet Union's victory in . World War II. A masked guard in Slovyansk, who gave his name only as . Sergei, said they have 'only one demand: a . referendum and joining Russia'. The man said they seized the . building because they wanted to protect it from radical nationalists . from western Ukraine and 'the junta who seized power in Kiev'. 'We don't want to be slaves of America and the West,' he said. 'We want to live with Russia.' The Interior Ministry said in a statement that the attackers used tear gas and stun grenades when they stormed the building, injuring three policemen. Protestors in Kharkov show their support for the disbanded Berkut riot police . Members of Ukraine's former elite Berkut riot police hold a line outside the regional police headquarters in Donetsk . The attackers' goal was to seize arms from the police station, authorities said, adding that there were about 40 automatic rifles and 400 pistols as well as ammunition inside. Interior Minister Arsen Avakov pledged a 'very tough response' to the seizure while local media reported special forces dispatched to the area. The militants replaced the Ukrainian flag on one of the buildings with the red, white and blue flag of Russia. Some local residents helped the militants build barricades out of tyres in anticipation that police would try to force them out. In Slaviansk, the mayor said the men who seized the police station were demanding a referendum on autonomy and possible annexation by Russia. Protesters in other eastern cities have made similar demands after a referendum in Crimea last month in which voters opted to split off from Ukraine, leading to annexation by Russia. The latest wave of unrest shows the spiraling anger in eastern Ukraine, which has a large Russian-speaking population. The region was the epicentre of support for the deposed Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych, who was ousted in February after months of protests in the capital, Kiev. Ethnic Russians in Ukraine's east widely fear that the authorities who took over after Yanukovych's fall will suppress them. The deepening unrest is spreading through towns and cities in eastern Ukraine, close to the border with Russia . Police chief Kostyantyn Pozhydayev appeared on the steps of the police station to speak to the protestors, telling them he was stepping down 'in accordance with your demands'. As he left the building, he was accompanied by some of his officers . Protestors replaced the Ukrainian flag flying from this Donetsk state building, with the red, white and blue flag of Russia . Masked activists brandishing metal poles stormed the regional prosecutor's office in Donetsk. Riot police escorted groups of the protestors from the building. No one was arrested . The occupations have deepened tensions in the region, causing potential flashpoints. If . any of the pro-Russian protestors are killed or injured by Ukrainian . forces, it could prompt the Kremlin to intervene to protect the local . Russian-speaking population in scenes reminiscent of the takeover of . Crimea. Moscow denies . any plan to send in forces or split Ukraine, but the Western-leaning . authorities in Kiev believe Russia is trying to create a pretext to . interfere again. NATO says Russian armed forces are massing on Ukraine's eastern border, while Moscow says they are on normal manoeuvres. Ukraine's acting foreign minister, Andrii Deshchytsia, said he had spoken in a phone call with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and demanded Moscow stop what he called 'provocative actions' by its agents in eastern Ukraine. Russia and Ukraine have been in confrontation since protests in Kiev forced the Moscow-backed president from office, and the Kremlin sent troops into Crimea. The crisis has been seized upon by . some right-wing nationalists in the EU who are campaigning for next . month's European Parliament elections. They blame Brussels for . antagonising Russia. Marine . Le Pen, leader of France's far-right National Front was in Moscow on . Saturday and met the speaker of Russia's lower house of parliament, one . of the people on an EU sanctions list. 'I am surprised a Cold War on Russia has been declared in the European Union,' Russian media quoted her as saying. The . EU and the United States imposed sanctions on Russian officials and . leading business figures in response to Moscow's annexation of Crimea, . which is home to Russia's Black Sea fleet and was part of Russia until . 1954.

A masked protestor stands guard outside the headquarters of Ukraine's security agency in the eastern city of Lugansk. Separatists demanding a referendum to join Russia seized the building a week ago as a wave of secessionist anger swept eastern Ukraine . While the crisis within Ukraine . itself is still unresolved, the gas dispute threatens to spread the . impact of the row to millions of people across Europe. A large proportion of the . natural gas which EU states buy from Russia is pumped via Ukrainian . territory, so if Russia makes good on a threat to cut off Ukraine for . non-payment of its bills, customers further west will have supplies . disrupted. Russia is demanding Kiev pay a much higher price for its gas, and settle unpaid bills. Russian . state-owned gas giant Gazprom and its Ukrainian counterpart, Naftogaz, . are in talks, but the chances of an agreement are slim. 'I . would say we are coming nearer to a solution of the situation, but one . in the direction that is bad for Ukraine,' Ukrainian Energy Minister . Yuri Prodan said in an interview with the German newspaper, . Boersenzeitung. 'We are probably steering towards Russia turning off its gas provision,' he was quoted as saying. That . raised the spectre of a repeat of past 'gas wars', when Ukraine's gas . was cut off, with a knock-on effect on supplies to EU states. The . scope for compromise narrowed after the Naftogaz chief executive told a . Ukrainian newspaper Kiev was suspending payments to Gazprom pending a . conclusion of talks over a new deal. Ukraine has de facto stopped payments already because it failed to make an installment of more than $500 million due earlier this month to Russian state gas giant Gazprom. Gazprom . spokesman Sergei Kupriyanov, said: 'What does suspending mean? They've . not paid at all,' since mid-way through last month. Moscow . says it does not want to turn off Ukraine's gas if it can be avoided, . and that it will honour all commitments to supply its EU customers. Kiev . and Brussels are working out ways to keep supplies flowing to EU . states, and for those countries to then pump the gas to Ukraine by . reversing the flow in their pipelines. The occupations have deepened tensions in the region, causing potential flashpoints. If any of the pro-Russian protestors are killed or injured by Ukrainian forces, it could prompt the Kremlin to intervene to protect the local Russian-speaking population . A man armed with a pistol, tucked into his top, stands guard outside the police headquarters in Slaviansk . Pro-Russian militants who have seized the building in Slaviansk have looted at least 400 handguns and 20 automatic weapons from the police station . Moscow has so far scoffed at the Western measures and warned that, in the long run, the EU and Washington will come off worse by losing out on trade with Russia. Gennady Timchenko, a billionaire oil and gas trader who is on the U.S. list of people subject to asset freezes and visa bans, joined the chorus of Russian defiance. 'The fact that I was included in the list was a little surprising maybe, but it was quite an honour for me,' he said in an interview with the state-run Rossiya television station to be broadcast later on Saturday. He said Russian natural gas would increasingly be sold to Asia, as part of a strategy of turning away from a Europe, which the Kremlin considers unfriendly. 'It seems to me they (the Europeans) just don't understand. The politicians are behaving ... in a very short-sighted way.'

"An argument about sex in a crowded restaurant ended with a millionaire businesswoman being bludgeoned to death in a five-star Paris hotel room, a court heard yesterday. Ian Griffin, 45, broke down in tears as he described how his row with Kinga Legg, 36, escalated on what had otherwise been ‘a fantastic visit’ to the French capital. On the second day of his murder trial at Paris Assizes, Griffin insisted that he had never intended to kill his fiancée. Scroll down for video . Ian Griffin, 45, said former girlfriend Kinga Legg, 36, kept antidepressant pills from him in a bid to 'be intimate', before the couple got into a public row in which she demanded sex . But he admitted ‘cleaning up’ their £1,000-a-night room at the five-star Bristol Hotel for up to six hours while Miss Legg’s body was still in it. Recalling the start of their vicious row at the Bound restaurant, off the Champs-Elysees, in May 2009, Griffin said it started when he said the medication he was on had dampened his libido. Miss Legg shouted back: ‘You owe me sex.’ Not wanting an argument about his sex life in public, Griffin replied: ‘My God, not here!’ The couple, who had been due to marry in Monaco the following August, had agreed a pact in which Griffin was not allowed to contact former girlfriends. But Miss Legg felt sexually frustrated and withheld eight of the anti-depressant pills Griffin was used to taking, in a bid to ‘be intimate with me’, said Griffin, who was left with just two pills. ‘She wanted sex and expressed it loudly, and when I asked her to be quiet she got even more angry, so I shouted “That’s it!”,’ said Griffin, who faces up to 30 years in prison if found guilty of murder. ‘I was so upset too, as we were having a fantastic trip and it ruined everything in just one minute.’ Griffin (pictured alongside current fiancee Tracey Baker) said Ms Legg shouted 'you owe me sex' while they were dining in a restaurant in Paris in 2009, sparking a bitter row . The pair made their own way back to the Bristol, where, after a vodka in the bar, Griffin opened the door of their room, to be confronted by Miss Legg saying: ‘Why did you leave me alone? How dare you leave me alone in Paris.’ Griffin, originally from Warrington, Cheshire, had intended to return to Britain straight away, but instead the argument intensified, with furniture being broken and thrown about. Griffin said ‘everything went black’ at that point, but ‘I woke up the next day, and looked at the room – it was terrible’. Griffin says he argued with Ms Legg in the bedroom of the five-star Bristol Hotel, Paris (pictured), but blacked out. When he woke he claims he found blood on the sheets, but had no memory of attacking Ms Legg . ‘I spent the day cleaning the room. I was going to get Kinga to smuggle in a vacuum cleaner. ‘I then called out her name. I unmade the bed because I thought she was between the mattresses. There was a big stain of blood. I didn’t know she wasn’t there. I thought she was in bed. I had no idea. ‘I was really messed up. I was in such a state. All I was thinking of was getting the room cleaned up. The TV was broken, everything was broken.’ He said when he finally saw Miss Legg’s body on the floor, his reaction was to ‘warm her up’ in the bath. ‘She was very cold,’ added Griffin. He said he screamed: ‘Kinga, Kinga, Kinga, please don’t go, please don’t go.’ He added: ‘I didn’t know she was dead. It was confusing. When Griffin found Ms Legg's body, he said he didn't realise she was dead at first, and put her in a bath to warm up while he placed a 'Do Not Disturb' sign on the door and cleaned the room . ‘I moved her arm, but somehow thought if I put her in the bath it would warm her up. She was stiff.’ Asked by Judge Didier Safar if he had seen the photos of Miss Legg’s corpse, which was found floating in the bath and had 92 bruises on it, Griffin said: ‘No. I only noticed she had a black eye.’ Griffin claimed he did not think Miss Legg was dead until about six and a half hours after he woke up on May 24, the day after their restaurant meal. The judge said: ‘That means you remained five or six hours in the presence of a corpse in a bedroom covered in blood’, to which Griffin replied: ‘Yes.’ Ms Legg was later found floating in the bathtub of the couple's £1,000-a-night room with almost 100 bruises covering her body (file picture) When he finally realised she was dead, a tearful Griffin said: ‘I wanted to die. I couldn’t cope with what had happened.’ He thought of jumping out of the window of the fifth-floor room, but then decided he wanted to commit suicide ‘back home’ after seeing his parents for the last time. The prosecution alleges that Griffin was ‘thinking lucidly’ because he put a ‘Do Not Disturb’ sign on the door of the room, and booked an extra two nights, before heading off in his Porsche 911. Judge Safar said: ‘You did not want Kinga Legg’s body to be discovered before you had put sufficient distance between yourself and the Bristol.’ Griffin replied: ‘Yes.’ Miss Legg, a Pole who was briefly married to an English civil servant called Peter Legg and who also used her maiden name Wolf, regularly told friends about her ‘abusive relationship’ with Griffin. The couple were briefly arrested in 2008 after Miss Legg attacked Griffin with a knife, but no charges were laid. Griffin denies murder. The trial is expected to run until Friday.

"A group of university feminists who had sexist abuse hurled at them have turned the insults into an attack on their bullies by calling themselves The Ugly Girls Club. The students at Royal Holloway University in Surrey were holding a talk about sexual consent at their student union when they overheard themselves being called 'The Ugly Girls Club.' But instead of letting the slurs get them down, they re-branded themselves The Ugly Girls Club and started a Twitter and Facebook campaign to reclaim the word ugly, tweeting pictures of themselves pulling unattractive faces with the hashtag #uglygirlsclub. Royal Holloway University feminists did a sexual consent talk in their union and overheard fellow students calling them Ugly Girls Club. They re-branded #uglygirlsclub and tweeted comedy ugly selfies . The social media site has since been flooded with hundreds of photos from supporters, both male and female, across the nation. Alex Vosper pulled down her lower eye lids, pouted her lips and tweeted 'proud to be hideous'. And Elena Barnard drooped her face, crossed her eyes and wrote 'sometimes I look cracking and sometimes I say stuff that's cracking. The stuff I say lasts longer'. One picture from Daniel Tremor showed him posing with a sign saying 'I'd rather be 'ugly' than a sexist w*****'. The campaign aims to: 'Challenge conventional beauty standards and superficial judgement' Natasha Barrett, the feminist society president at Royal Holloway University of London, in Egham, Surrey, said the funny selfies carry a serious message. Speaking to student newspaper the Tab, she said: 'The aim of the campaign is to empower people to not just think of their worth in physical terms. 'The selfies were tongue in cheek to start with but they carry a serious message too.' The Royal, Holloway feminist society started the Twitter campaign to reclaim the word ugly. Hundreds of supporters from across UK have now messaged selfies in response . She continued: 'There are some fantastic student feminist campaigns around at the moment like 'Reclaim Your Campus' and the National Union of Students 'Lad Culture' campaign - anything that helps draw attention to these issues is great. 'One student said that the campaign had given her a confidence boost and that she was never going to delete her 'unsatisfactory' selfies ever again, and that's exactly the kind of response we want. 'Women have enough self-esteem problems as it is - if this campaign can go a little way to help combat that then we're happy.'","Royal Holloway University feminists did sexual consent talk in their union .

"Defence Minister David Johnston and his Chief Of Staff Sean Costello indulged in a series of expensive meals with industry officials who are chasing lucrative government contracts. Dining receipts obtained by News Corp journalist Ian McPhedran show Mr Johnston, Mr Costello and defence industry executives spent $6384 of taxpayers money in pricey restaurants during November. The revelations of the meals - often washed down with $200 bottles of wine - come as ordinary troops in Australia's armed services face cuts to their entitlements and a 1.5 per cent pay increase which is below the rate of inflation. A spokesman for the Defence Minister told Daily Mail Australia that the spending was all within guidelines. Scroll down for video . Receipts showing thousands of taxpayers dollars being spent on lavish meals by Defence Minister David Johnson have been revealed, with this $662 receipt from Sean's Kitchen in Adelaide . This receipt shows some of the items indulged in at Balthazar restaurant in Perth on November 12 . 'All hospitality hosted by the Defence Minister and extended to foreign dignitaries or industry heads, including at the time of the Albany Commemoration, has been within guidelines and is consistent with previous Defence Ministers’ practice,' the spokesperson said. The first lavish dinner took place on November 2 at Perth's Matilda Bay Restaurant, where rib eye steaks, lamb and snapper along with three bottles of Henschke Mt Edlestone Shiraz at $190 a bottle contributed to the $2332 bill, News Corp reported. The prestigious establishment has waterfront views of the Swan River. Just a few days later, on November 5, Mr Johnston and Mr Costello were in Adelaide dining with Bruce Carter, chairman of submarine builder ASC and one of the companies chasing government work, sources told News Corp. The trio polished off two bottles of $143 shiraz at Sean's Kitchen, and two martinis at $20 each, according to the $662 receipt. Defence Minister David Johnston (left) and his Chief Of Staff Sean Costello (right) dined with industry executives hoping to secure billion dollar government contracts . These accusations come as defence personnel are facing cuts to their allowances and pay . The next stop was Balthazar Restaurant in Perth where the $722 bill - again racked up between just three people - included two $172 bottles of Omensetter Shiraz, two pork fillets and a cheese platter, News Corp reported. For the November 12 dinner, Mr Johnston and Mr Costello shared a meal and a few drinks with 'a senior executive from Austal.' Shipbuilder Austal is also seeking defence work from the government according to News Corp.

"Atheists tend to be more intelligent than religious people, according to a US study. Researchers found that those with high IQs had greater self-control and were able to do more for themselves - so did not need the benefits that religion provides. They also have better self esteem and built more supportive relationships, the study authors said. New evidence: A study has concluded that religious people are less intelligent than non-believers . The conclusions were the result of a review of 63 scientific studies about religion and intelligence dating between 1928 and last year. In 53 of these there was a ‘reliable negative relation between intelligence and religiosity’. In just 10 was that relationship positive. Even among children, the more intelligent a child was the more probable it was that they would shun the church. In old age the same trend persisted as well, the research showed. The University of Rochester psychologists behind the study defined religion as involvement in some or all parts of a belief. They defined intelligence as the ‘ability to reason, plan, solve problems, think abstractly, comprehend complex ideas, learn quickly, and learn from experience’. In their conclusions, they said: ‘Most extant explanations (of a negative relation) share one central theme - the premise that religious beliefs are irrational, not anchored in science, not testable and, therefore, unappealing to intelligent people who ‘know better’. ‘Intelligent people typically spend more time in school - a form of self-regulation that may yield long-term benefits. ‘More intelligent people getting higher level jobs and better employment and higher salary may lead to higher self-esteem, and encourage personal control beliefs.’ Study co-author Jordan Silberman, a graduate student of neuroeconomics at the University of Rochester, said: ‘Intelligence may lead to greater self-control ability, self-esteem, perceived control over life events, and supportive relationships, obviating some of the benefits that religion sometimes provides.’ Detailed: The research analysed 63 surveys comparing intelligence levels and religious beliefs between 1928 and 2012 . Research from the UK last week showed another drawback to being religious, or at least Christian - you lose out in the race for top jobs. Official figures show nearly one in four people who have no religious belief now live in homes headed by someone with a senior executive job or a place in one of the professions. But well under a fifth of Christians are employed in the best-paid and most influential jobs or are married to someone who is, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The last census, carried out in March 2011, showed a fall in the number of people that call themselves Christian in the UK. Christian numbers in England and Wales, including children, fell by 4.1 million in a decade to 33.2 million. However there was a 45 per cent rise over the same 10 years in numbers who say they have no religion, to 14.1 million.","Research found those with higher IQs more likely to dismiss religion .

"Atrial fibrillation — an erratic heartbeat — affects up to 800,000 Britons, and can lead to a stroke if left untreated. Eileen Marshall, 67, a retired insurance worker from Southend, Essex, underwent a new procedure for it. THE PATIENT . 'Even after a nap I’d feel drained of energy,' said Eileen Marshall . Four years ago, I noticed I was feeling increasingly tired. Even after a nap I’d feel drained of energy. After four months I saw my GP who did several blood tests, but each came back normal. Then in November 2013, I had a health assessment before surgery for arthritis in my hand — this involved having an electrocardiogram to record my heart’s electrical activity. Apparently, they do this for the over-60s to check your heart is OK and it’s therefore safe to operate. The next day, the hospital advised me to see my GP, who said my operation was being postponed because my heart was beating very fast. I was prescribed beta-blockers to slow my heartbeat, but I had to stop taking them as it swung too far the other way and got down to just 30 beats a minute (60 to 100 is normal). Other pills didn’t help either and I still felt incredibly tired. Eventually, my GP referred me to Southend University Hospital’s cardiology department. A year ago, I was put on a heart monitor for three days and was later diagnosed with atrial fibrillation (AF) — the extreme tiredness I’d been suffering was a typical symptom. I was told that normally your heart contracts and relaxes to a regular beat. But with this condition, random electrical pulses fire off from veins around the heart, so the upper chambers beat irregularly or quiver. This meant my heart had to pump extra hard to get oxygen-rich blood around my body, which explained the tiredness. It could also put me at risk of blood clots and stroke, so I started taking the blood thinner warfarin. The heart monitor had shown that my heart was quivering (‘fibrillating’) at certain times of the day; in between it would return to normal. This narrowed the range of suitable treatments. 'After a week, the fatigue lifted... Now I’m enjoying life,' said Eileen . Given that drugs had been unsuccessful, my cardiologist suggested I had catheter ablation, where they use a wire to burn away the areas of heart tissue triggering rogue electrical pulses. In June, I was referred to cardiologist Professor Richard Schilling at Barts Health NHS Trust in London. He told me about a new technique: instead of burning the affected tissue, he’d freeze it with a special balloon. This would be faster and more successful at stopping the rogue signals getting to my heart. The procedure would take an hour and not involve a general anaesthetic. I had the procedure in July. I arrived at the hospital early in the morning, was given a local anaesthetic and sedated, and was discharged by 2pm. I’d been warned about bruising in the groin as this is where the tube attached to the balloon is inserted — but I had no side-effects at all. After a week, the fatigue lifted. I still take warfarin as a precaution against blood clots and keep an eye on my pulse. But now I’m enjoying life, such as travelling with my husband Joe. THE SURGEON . Richard Schilling is a professor of cardiology and electrophysiology at Barts Health NHS Trust. Atrial fibrillation causes an irregular and often very fast heart rate. The heart’s natural pacemaker — called the sinus node, an area of cells in the upper right chamber, or atrium — is over-ridden by abnormal electrical impulses fired off by the four pulmonary veins, which drain oxygenated blood from the lungs into the left atrium. These ‘rogue’ signals cause the heart’s two upper chambers, the atria, to contract randomly and at a rate of up to 200 times a minute. This means that oxygenated blood is not pumped properly but pools in the heart, causing palpitations, dizziness, breathlessness and fatigue. Doctors start newly diagnosed patients on drugs to regulate the heartbeat. We can also do cardio-version, where electric shock treatment resets the heart to a normal rhythm. But this doesn’t tackle the underlying cause and isn’t suitable for patients such as Eileen — her AF was intermittent and the heart would reset itself. Cryoballoon therapy: A tiny balloon filled with gas is super-cooled to minus 75c. The balloon freezes a perfect ring of scar tissue around each pulmonary vein, so there are no gaps . Doctors can also ‘burn’ the tissue around the pulmonary veins, usually with catheter ablation — where a wire with an electrode on the end is threaded up to the heart via an incision in the groin. It burns a ring of dots around the source of the faulty signal, forming scar tissue, which blocks the signal. However, 40 per cent of these treatments need to be redone — tiny gaps can remain between the burns, causing some signals to get through, or the scar tissue may repair itself. Cryoballoon therapy gets round this problem. A tiny balloon filled with gas is super-cooled to minus 75c. The balloon freezes a perfect ring of scar tissue around each pulmonary vein, so there are no gaps. I’ve been conducting a clinical trial that shows the cryoballoon is quicker to perform than conventional ablation because it forms the ring of scar tissue in one go, rather than being burnt away bit by bit. The cryoballoon has been available on the NHS for six years, but we’ve been performing a streamlined version for six months. I’ve cut the procedure time from three hours and an overnight hospital stay to one hour, with the patient going home that day. Symptoms cease in up to 80 per cent of patients and if this treatment is still working after three months, it’s likely to remain effective — and the scar tissue is less likely to recover, though it’s unclear why. There’s also less trauma to the tissue, partly because catheter ablation uses radio waves which convert to heat, which is more damaging. This procedure is ideal for people like Eileen with intermittent atrial fibrillation and for whom drugs don’t work. The earlier you treat people with intermittent AF, the more chance you have of preventing their condition becoming persistent. First, we make two tiny punctures in the femoral vein at the top of the leg on the right side of the groin. Through one, we insert a wire to stimulate the nerve supplying the diaphragm — if it’s twitching, we know it isn’t being damaged during the freezing. Through the second hole, we insert a long tube — a catheter — and thread it into the left atrium, which is responsible for pumping oxygenated blood around the body. At the end of the tube is a 10mm long balloon. We pump nitrous oxide into the balloon, which inflates to 28mm in volume and freezes to minus 75c. We position the inflated balloon inside the entrance of one of the pulmonary veins. The freezing surface of this balloon sticks to the rogue tissue causing the atrial fibrillation. We hold it in place for four minutes while it creates a 1mm diameter unbroken circle of scar tissue. We repeat the process at the entrance of all four pulmonary veins to prevent the rogue signals entering the heart. Patients go home after four hours’ bed rest. The cryoballoon is a step forward in the treatment of atrial fibrillation. As more of these procedures can be performed in a day, it could shorten waiting lists. ANY DRAWBACKS? As patients with atrial fibrillation take anti-clotting drugs, they are more prone to bruising from the surgery. There is also a rare chance of the procedure damaging the gullet, though this risk is lower than with catheter ablation. Dr Glyn Thomas, a consultant cardiologist and electrophysiologist at the Bristol Heart Institute, says: ‘There has been a revolution in the treatment of AF and for many patients it is curable. ‘Of course, we do need to see the results of this study, but the hope is this procedure will increase first-time success, which will be good news for patients.’ The operation costs £6,000 on the NHS and £9,000 privately.","Eileen Marshall was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation (AF)

"For those worried about eating their five a day, this vending machine could offer a helping hand. Instead of dispensing junk food and fizzy drinks, it distributes vegetables to shoppers. The machine allows shoppers to pay between £3-£5 for a selection of locally-sourced produce, including bags of potatoes and mixed vegetable boxes. The Grewer Farm vending machine is proving a big hit in Dundee . Popular: The dispenser has been installed at Overgate Shopping Centre in Dundee . It is the brainchild of farmers Pete and Euan Grewar, who trialled the dispenser at their East Ardler farm outside Blairgowrie, Angus, Scotland. And so far, it has been a hit in Dundee, which was last year crowned the worst city in Scotland for child obesity. A successful two-month trial period helped the cousins secure a deal for its installation in Overgate Shopping Centre. A day after it was unveiled, shoppers had emptied some of the compartments. The modern machine, filled with potato bags and vegetable trays, was inspired by the traditional honesty box found on many farms. Pete (left) and Ewan Grewar with the dispenser inspired by the traditional honesty box found on farms . A bag of potatoes costs £3, while a tray containing six free range eggs, six baking potatoes, a turnip, onions and carrots costs £5. Shoppers insert their money into a slot and a corresponding compartment opens, containing their buy inside. Pete Grewar, 36, who runs the farm  with his cousin Euan, 33, said: 'We've had a vending machine out the bottom of our farm road for two months and it has been very popular. 'Honesty boxes have been on farms for years so the machine is an extension of that. 'I think that it's a new way for people to have a direct link back to the farm where their vegetables are grown. A tray containing six free range eggs, six baking potatoes, a turnip, onions and carrots costs £5 . 'People are moving more and more towards wanting a closer link with their food. 'Farm shops are becoming popular again and the machine is a way for people in the heart of a city to get fresh vegetables.' The launch comes after statistics found that one in five primary one pupils in Dundee were overweight, obese or severely obese. It is believed that an unhealthy diet was a large factor contributing to the figures. It was also discovered that Dundee was among the top 10 worst areas in the UK for heart health, with more than 250 deaths coronary heart disease every year. The vending machine is made by German company Roesler and can be used to vend a number of items. Mr Grewar said the concept would be trialled for a further three months and could then be installed in other locations across Scotland if it proves to be popular. The original veggie vending machine is still on East Ardler farm outside Blairgowrie, Angus, Scotland . He added: 'We thought we'd try it somewhere with more footfall and the Overgate Centre were very keen. 'We're looking to put them elsewhere and are open to all suggestions.' Malcolm Angus, Overgate Centre Manager said: 'We were keen to support a local business with such an innovative idea. 'We are really happy to see how our shoppers have taken to the vegetable vending already with an encouraging start on day one.' Fresh produce: The boxes cost between £3 and £5 . Rachel Neary, marketing executive at the Overgate Centre, added: 'So far it's been really good. I walked past on Monday and could see that several of the boxes had already been bought. 'It's the only place in the centre where you can buy fresh produce, and it's local so we know exactly where it came from, even down to the specific field. 'The furthest away the food comes from is 15 miles. It's great.' Dundee resident Jill Darling said: 'I do like the idea but I was hoping it would sell individual portions of fruit. 'I think it might work out very well because there is nothing else nearby where people can buy vegetables other than Lidl. 'It's a definite start and you know you are getting good produce.'","Farmers Pete and Euan Grewer trialled dispenser at their farm in Angus .

"His heroics more than a hundred years ago during a deadly battle close to the Afghanistan border mirrored the bravery of Britain's Taliban-fighting soldiers. Now a Victoria Cross won by an army officer who only stopped fighting when he fainted - having been shot three times - has emerged for sale for £180,000. Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Watson had already been hit in the thigh trying to clear a village in British India of murderous warriors when he insisted on going back. The Victoria Cross (right) awarded to Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Watson (left) who only stopped fighting when he fainted - having been shot three times - has emerged for sale for £180,000 . Lr Col Watson led a 'few' men on a charge to remove tribesmen from the village of Bilot (pictured) in what was then British India . He was shot again in the arm, had his hand smashed by a bullet and he had to be carried from the battlefieldby his men after passing out due to blood loss. It was noted that the officer had 'in all probability saved the whole force from being wiped out' by the Pashtun enemy in what is now northern Pakistan in 1897. Despite the gravity of his condition Lt Col Watson later modestly described his injuries as nothing more than a flesh wound when he wrote home to his wife so as not to panic her. Lt Col Watson's actions received praise by a young Winston Churchill who was part of the relief force that arrived the following day. Churchill later wrote of Lt Col Watson's heroics: '...the man will go on, unshaken and unflinching after he has received a severe and painful wound.' Lt Col Watson was awarded the VC for his bravery. He went on to serve in World War One but died from illness in 1917. Despite the gravity of his condition Lt Col Watson (right) later modestly described his injuries as nothing more than a flesh wound when he wrote home to his wife Edith Welchman (left) so as not to panic her . Lt Col Watson's medals (right), including the Victoria Cross, have been passed down through the Watson family who are now selling it at auction. His wife Edith is pictured left . The medal, the highest military decoration for valour in the face of an enemy, has been passed down through the Watson family who are now selling it at auction. David Erskine-Hill, of London auctioneers Dix Noonan and Webb, said: 'The North West Frontier was so oft the scene of savage fighting and heavy casualties in days of the Empire. 'And the story behind Thomas Watson's VC epitomises the very nature of that fighting - a small hillside village, surrounded by overwhelming numbers of hostile tribesmen, and a remarkable band of British and Indian troops who held on against all the odds, until relieved. 'Watson led two hair-raising charges at the cost of multiple wounds, including a shattered hand and ruptured artery. 'No wonder Winston Churchill, who arrived with the relief force the following morning, was later moved to describe Watson's courage as 'sublime'. 'But in common with many fellow VCs, Watson remained extremely modest about his accomplishments, his charming letter to his wife, written in haste soon after those momentous events, merely referring to one or two 'grazes.' Lt Col Watson, from Louth, Lincolnshire, was commissioned in to the Royal Engineers in 1888. He married his wife Edith Welchman, who herself had previously been awarded the Royal Red Cross for her efforts in the nursing of British soldiers in India. The family's collection is set to sell for up to £180,000 when it goes up for auction . The officer fought in the First World War and was the commanding engineer of the 12th Inidian Division in Mesopotamia (Iraq) against the Ottoman Empire. A photo album belonging to the Watsons is pictured above . In July 1897 an army of 10,000 Pashtun tribesmen lay siege to the British garrison in Malakand. Months later, on the night of September 16 at the village of Bilot that was being held by the enemy, Lt Col Watson rounded up 'a few' men of the East Kent Regiment and of the Bengal Sappers. He led them in a charge to remove the tribesmen who retaliated with heavy fire. In his 1898 book, the Story of the Malakand Field Force, Churchill wrote of how the burning village was a 'shambles' when the relief party arrived the next day. The future Prime Minister wrote: 'All round lay corpses of men and mules. The bodies of five or six native soldiers were being buried in a hurriedly dug grave. 'Eighteen wounded men lay side by side in a roofless hut, their faces drawn by pain and anxiety looked ghastly in the pale light of the early morning.' Churchill's account of the action the night before stated: 'The village was too large for so small a party to clear. 'The tribesmen killed and wounded several of the soldiers and a bullet smashed Lieutenant Watson's hand. He however continued his efforts and did not cease until again shot, this time so severely as to be unable to stand. Lt Col Watson's actions received praise by a young Winston Churchill who was part of the relief force that arrived the following day. The officers 'record of services' is shown above . 'His men carried him from the village.' Four days later, while recovering from his wounds, Lt Col Watson wrote the letter to 'my own darling' wife. He wrote his getting injured: 'I got touched on the right leg, only a graze...I went back to get some Sappers...I hurried back and was pointing out where the devils were sneaking up when I got a slight flesh wound in the inside of the right arm - nothing of consequence but unfortunately almost immediately afterwards I got hit badly on the left hand.' The brave officer went on to fight in the First World War and was the commanding engineer of the 12th Inidian Division in Mesopotamia (Iraq) against the Ottoman Empire. He contracted an illness from which he died in London in June 1917 aged 50. Lt Col Watson's Victoria Cross has recently been bequeathed to three grown up children who have decided it is best to sell it now as it cannot be divided between them. The VC along with other medals and letters home is being sold on December 10.","Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Watson was handed Victoria Cross for bravery .

This was one of 13 robberies, five attempted robberies and a burglary which the serial crook committed in two weeks, mostly in the Stockport area. After his shop was raided, Doug Gill, 62, was determined that Thomas would not get away with it. The store owner was able to hand over clear CCTV footage of the crook raiding his shop to police, who arrested Thomas  after the image was published in a local newspaper.

Doug said: 'That is a good result. I was annoyed and upset that he pulled a gun on a nice young girl. She is remarkable and has dealt with it well. 'I thought I had the CCTV and if I could get it out there we could get this man brought to justice. 'We are always on guard for this sort of thing and never fully relax.' Thomas, from Cheadle Hulme, admitted one count of robbery, with the other offences, plus another three of possessing an imitation firearm, taken into consideration. He must serve eight years, with four on licence. Businesses he targeted included branches of Subway, William Hill bookmakers, the Co-op and Bargain Booze. All took place between August 16 and 31 this year, with some involving a gun or a note claiming he had a gun. Police said on the majority of occasions, the offender calmly queued up and when he has reached the till, produced a handwritten note claiming he had a gun.

"The BBC launched an investigation after a listener complained that Samantha, the imaginary scorer on long-running Radio 4 comedy show I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue, was being treated as 'a sexual object'. The programme, which has been on the air for more than 40 years, features comics including Jack Dee and Barry Cryer who regularly refer to the fictional 'lovely Samantha' - who does not actually exist. After a listener complained about two episodes in July last year which she said included 'highly sexist, offensive and harmful' references to Samantha, The BBC Trust's Editorial Standards Committee looked into the allegations before deciding not to proceed. I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue  has had a number of regular panellists including host Jack Dee (pictured left) A recently released BBC Trust report said: 'She considered that Samantha was only referred to as a sexual object and believed the male panellists used 'schoolboy sexist so-called humour', that was 'both puerile and unfunny'.' The report referred to examples of innuendo included on the show, including a description of the character as 'a lovely lady who's scored on more desks than she can remember'. In one episode, listeners were told that Samantha was going to the cinema with two men who were fans of horror films because 'she enjoys nothing better than sitting in the back row and being given the willies for 90 minutes'. The programme was defended by its producer, who said using innuendo was 'part of the programme's tradition of wordplay and punning' and was appreciated by 'the vast majority of listeners'. The programme features comics including Jack Dee (pictured) and Barry Cryer who regularly refer to the fictional character of 'lovely Samantha' She was also told: 'The 'Samantha' character is a very long running joke in the show which listeners are very familiar with.' The listener took her complaint to the BBC Trust and quoted a United Nations Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women, who in discussing UK society, had referred to a 'boys' club sexist culture' and said that the media was responsible for 'negative and over-sexualised portrayals of women'. A letter from a member of the Editorial Complaints Unit to the complainant said: 'You may be reassured to know that your complaint has prompted some lengthy and detailed discussion between senior managers at BBC Radio Comedy and the producers of the show. 'I think it is fair to say that a number of senior figures share, at least in part, your concerns about the manner in which Samantha is portrayed in the programme. 'I have discussed this with the Head of BBC Radio Comedy and she has asked me to tell you that she is currently in talks with the producer of the show about how to update the Samantha character and has said that changes will be made to the way Samantha is presented in the future.' The show's producer also told the complainant in a letter that the show would book more female panelists and feature Sven, described as the 'male equivalent of Samantha', more often. The producer added the show would make it clear that Samantha was a 'willing even enthusiastic participant in the liaisons' and stress that she was often the initiator in these relationships to avoid the suggestion that she was being taken advantage of.' It would make clear, the letter said, that 'Samantha, like Sven, has a prodigious sexual appetite'. The BBC Radio 4 programme was defended by its producer who said using innuendo was 'part of the programme's tradition of wordplay and punning' and was appreciated by 'the vast majority of listeners' The Trust's Editorial Standards Committee said it 'could understand why some listeners believed that this type of humour was outdated', but said 'the majority of listeners were familiar with the content of the show and enjoyed the wordplay associated with the innuendo'. However, the Trust also decided the appeal 'did not qualify to proceed for consideration' because it did not have a reasonable prospect of success. I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue is one of Radio 4's top-performing programmes and according to BBC research, has a higher proportion of female listeners than men. The BBC Trust's Editorial Standards Committee has five members and sets the editorial and content standards for the BBC, and oversees the editorial complaints process. A BBC spokesman said: 'We note and accept the findings of the BBC Trust.' 'Samantha has to nip off now to meet the Hairy Bikers...They'll light the candle then Samantha will blow them out in the garden.' 'Samantha has got to go off early to meet an entomologist friend who's been showing her his collection of winged insects. They've already covered his bees and wasps and tonight she's hoping to go through his flies.' 'Samantha has to nip out to the House of Lords with her constituency friend. He's looking for support for his MP who's facing expulsion, and Samantha says it's important to have a good peer if his member's likely to be out.' 'Samantha has to nip off to the National Opera where she's been giving private tuition to the singers. Having seen what she did to the baritone, the director is keen to see what she might to for a tenor.' 'Samantha's just started keeping bees and already has three dozen or so. She says she's got an expert handler coming round to give a demonstration. He'll carefully take out her 38 bees and soon have them flying round his head.' 'Samantha has to go now as she's off to meet her Italian gentleman friend who's taking her out for an ice cream. She says she likes nothing better than to spend the evening licking the nuts off a large Neapolitan.' 'Samantha tells me she has to pop out now as she does a few chores for an elderly gentleman who lives nearby. She shows him how to use the washing machine and then goes out to prune his fruit trees. Later he'll be hanging out his pyjamas as he watches her beaver away up the ladder.'

"The parents of a baby who died while she was under the care of a childcare worker have called on the industry to introduce written guidelines on sleep and rest. Indianna, five months old, was found unresponsive in her cot at the home of Tracey Cross, who provided services for the Sunshine Coast Family Day Care Scheme, on the morning of July 20, 2012. An inquest into Indianna's death, which ended on Tuesday, was told by a pathologist the baby girl had died of sudden infant death syndrome, also known as SIDS,The Courier Mail reported. Scroll down for video . Mother Emma Hicks, pictured with husband Derek, dropped off her daughter Indianna at the home of carer Tracey Cross on the morning of July 20, 2012 . The parents of the baby, Emma and Derek Hicks, said the inquest had identified issues  surrounding 'inconsistent and non-existent' safe sleeping practices, especially those in the childcare industry. 'Nothing will bring our beautiful daughter back, however it is through a medium such as this and a tragedy like this, that changes can be made to reduce the risks and of course, of this happening again to another family,' Mr Hicks said. Mr Hicks described the ordeal as 'traumatic' for the family. His wife said their daughter was a 'beautiful, pink, chubby, happy baby girl' who they 'loved very much'. Pressure from the Hicks was backed up by Department of Education and Training officials, Regulation Assessment and Service Quality executive director Catherine O'Malley saying it was 'a good idea' to put written guidelines on sleep and rest in place for the industry. It is not required under Queensland law, but she stressed if any were brought in they had to be 'non-prescriptive'. Counsel assisting the Coroner Emily Cooper noted in her final submissions that despite the fact it was not possible to find out if Indianna's death could have been avoided, she would recommend looking at introducing sleep and rest policies. It comes after a tearful apology from Tracey Cross who was responsible for Indianna at the time of her death. Ms Cross told the inquest on Monday and the five-month-old's parents she had blamed herself for Indianna's death until she found out the baby had died of SIDS months later. 'I thought I must have wrapped her wrong or suffocated her or something and I blamed myself for a very wrong time,' she said. The home daycare operator said she went into shock immediately after the incident and did not know how to break the news to Ms Hicks when she arrived to pick up Indianna and her son Lachlan. Ms Hicks, who was sitting with her husband Derek, left the Brisbane courtroom in tears as Ms Cross described the moment she realised Indianna was in trouble . 'I apologise to no end that we didn't get to Emma in time,' a sobbing Ms Cross said. 'But you've got to remember that ... by the time the ambulance took Indi ... I was beside myself. 'I knew Emma was going to turn up and I was worried about who was going to tell her. I knew I was in no position (to).' Ms Hicks, who was sitting with her husband Derek, had to leave the courtroom in tears when Ms Cross described the moment she realised Indianna was in trouble. Earlier in the two-day inquest, the grieving mother had told the court she had been reluctant to leave her daughter with Ms Cross, given Indianna had recently been to the doctor with a cold and still had a runny nose. 'I did question leaving her and she insisted that she would be fine,' Ms Hicks said. Ms Hicks also said she was upset Ms Cross started caring for other children less than a week later, and that she had smelt cigarette smoke on Ms Cross and in her home, which she was also concerned about. But in her evidence, Ms Cross rejected both points, saying she had never smoked and she returned to work only in a reduced capacity four weeks after the incident. The inquest looked at the circumstances before Indianna's death, best sleeping practices for children aged three to six months, and how similar deaths could be prevented. Emma Hicks dropped Indianna off at the home of Ms Cross, who provided services for the Sunshine Coast Family Day Care Scheme, on the morning of July 20, 2012. That afternoon, Ms Cross checked on Indianna to find her laying face down, limp and pale. Attempts to revive her on the kitchen floor were unsuccessful and she was pronounced dead at Caloundra Hospital.","Mother Emma Hicks dropped off her baby Indianna at home of carer Tracey Cross on July 20, 2012 .

"A peaceful rally over the presumed massacre of 43 missing students ended with violence and destruction in Mexico City, with protesters calling for the president to stand down. Thousands marched along Mexico City's main boulevard, chanting for Enrique Pena Nieto to resign and waving blackened flags of the country in anger over the case of the missing students. They echoed 'you are not alone' to parents of the missing who joined the rally at the Angel of Independence Monument. As night fell in Mexico City, a small group of masked protesters armed with bats hurled firebombs at banks . Protesters smashed the windows of several shops along Reforma Boulevard, which is popular with tourists . 'Pena Nieto must resign,' Clemente Rodriguez, father of missing student Cristian, told the crowd, after two leading newspapers showed the embattled president's approval rating dropping to around 40 per cent. As night fell, a small group of masked protesters armed with bats threw firebombs at banks and broke the windows of several shops along Reforma Boulevard, which is popular with tourists. Hundreds of riot police protecting the Senate used fire extinguishers to repel the protesters. Around 15 protesters were slightly injured, a Red Cross worker at the scene told AFP. Three people, including a 17-year-old, were detained over the vandalism, a city government spokesman added.

Pena Nieto, who took office on December 1, 2012, has faced a wave of protests that have ended in sporadic acts of violence since the students vanished two months ago. Thousands more protested in the southern state of Guerrero, where a drug gang has confessed to killing the teachers' college students after local police handed them over in September. A group of protesters ransacked the Guerrero state prosecutor's office in the regional capital, Chilpancingo, and set five vehicles on fire, including two police cruisers.

As Mexicans protested again, a poll published by El Universal newspaper showed just 41 per cent approve of the president's performance, while the daily Reforma found 39 per cent were satisfied. It was the worst approval rating for a president since Ernesto Zedillo in the mid-1990s, underscoring the magnitude of the crisis Pena Nieto is facing.

Riot police evade a molotov cocktail hurled by demonstrators during a protest demanding justice in the case of the 43 missing students from Ayotzinapa . Pena Nieto announced that he has sent constitutional reforms to Congress aimed at disbanding the country's notoriously corrupt municipal police forces to allow the federal government to take over gang-infiltrated towns. The president unveiled the plan last week, two months after the students were attacked by police in the city of Iguala, allegedly under the mayor's orders. The case has put a spotlight on Mexico's struggle to end corruption and impunity amid a drug war that has left 100,000 people dead or missing since 2006. Police vehicles burn after demonstrators marching to demand justice for the 43 missing students attacked the State Attorney General's offices in the state capital city of Chilpancingo . Demonstrators take part in a protest in Guadalajara city demanding justice in the case of the 43 students that went missing in Iguala, Guerrero state, last September 26 . 'What happened in Iguala marks a before and an after,' Pena Nieto said Monday during a visit to the impoverished southern state of Chiapas. 'It showed the institutional weakness to face organized crime, which today has more numbers, weapons and power than in the past,' he said. His plan, however, has drawn skepticism from human rights groups and analysts. They say it is not enough to weed out corruption and abuses across the country.

"David Cameron has been warned by Poland that he must water down his plans to curb benefits for EU migrants or they will be blocked. Rafal Trzaskowski, Poland's deputy foreign minister, insisted the rules would have to apply to Britons as well as workers from other parts of Europe. Mr Cameron used his long-awaited immigration speech last week to insist that curbs on tax credits, child benefits, jobseekers allowance and council housing will be a key demand for his talks on renegotiating Britain's EU membership. Scroll down for video . Rafal Trzaskowski, Poland's deputy foreign minister, insisted new rules on curbing access to benefits would have to apply to Britons as well as workers from other parts of Europe . Under the Prime Minister's plans, unemployed EU migrants in Britain will be banned from receiving state support, and would be deported if they do not get a job within six months of arriving. For those in work, they would be barred from claiming handouts like housing benefit or tax credits until they have being in the UK for four years. There will also be a ban on 'exporting' child benefit for children living in other EU countries. Mr Cameron admitted that his proposals would require treaty change but would need support from across the EU to push through such measures. Mr Trzaskowski said it was an 'absolute red line' for his government that there is no discrimination in the welfare system on grounds of nationality. He said the plans to stop migrants from claiming benefits for the first four years after they arrive in Britain as well as kick out those who fail to find work after six months would go against all existing laws and insisted Poland would oppose the plans as they stand. David Cameron has threatened to block any new members joining the European Union without limits on their citizens flocking to Britain for work . FOR WORKERS FROM THE EU: . No in-work benefits until they have been in Britain for four years . No social housing for four years . No child benefit or tax credits paid for children living outside the UK . FOR UNEMPLOYED EU MIGRANTS: . No support from the UK taxpayer . Deportation if they do not get a job for six months . Other measures include: . Impose restrictions on EU migrants bringing in family members from outside the EU . Longer bans on rough sleepers, beggars and fraudsters returning to the UK . Tougher rules on deporting foriegn criminals . Refusing to allow other countries to join the EU without imposing controls on the movement of their workers until their economies have reached UK levels . Mr Trzaskowski told BBC Newsnight: 'If one wants to get away with all the benefits that are enshrined in the regulation of EU and treat immigrants from EU differently, and for example only pay benefits after four years of their stay in Britain or extradite people who can't find work, that would be against all the existing laws of the EU and obviously that would be a red line for us.' 'The Polish government is quite ready to talk about abuses of existing systems, sham marriages, extraditing criminals and so forth. 'But to be truthful this is not the problem, it is marginal. When it comes to changing the rules in the EU, when it comes to social support and so forth, when it comes to undermining the existing laws, obviously we are going to react quite strongly and we are going to be against. 'But the most important thing is that David Cameron wants to talk about it and doesn't want to change policies unilaterally.' He added: 'This is an absolute red line, that there is no discrimination on grounds of nationality. If Britain were to change its policy, for example, into contributory system in which everyone has to pay in to get some money from the system we then could talk about changes if they were absolutely non-discriminatory.' Mr Cameron made clear that without agreement on allowing the UK to dramatically curtail the pull factors which make it so attractive to EU migrants, he will 'rule nothing out' – raising the prospect of backing Britain's exit from the EU if he does not get his way. In an apparent attempt to win the support of countries like Poland, he appealed to other European nations who have seen thousands of their citizens move to the UK to support limiting movement across the continent. But he warned Britain will veto any new countries joining the EU unless he gets his way on imposing limits on workers from poor countries moving in search of work.","Poland's deputy foreign minister expresses alarm at Cameron's plan .

"In the tiny Texas town of Harrold, children and their parents do not give much thought to their safety at the community's only school, because they know that some of the teachers are carrying concealed weapons. In the remote town, the nearest law enforcement office is 30 minutes away and the residents know each other and trust each other, so the school board made the momentous decision to allow teachers to arm themselves at their work around children. Desperate to avoid the deadly consequences of their own school shooting incident, Harrold Independent School District has utlized armed teachers since 2007 and in the light of the Sandy Hook Elementary massacre became convinced it was the correct decision. Armed and ready: At any one time, the teachers of Harrold Indepedent School District are carrying weapons and able to respond to a school shooter . 'Virginia Tech was a wake up call. We evisioned that happening at our school, we envisioned having no protection,' said Harrold Schools Superintendant David Thweatt to CNN. 'Casualties mount up very quickly and the only thing as we know that has stopped any of the shooters in any of the schools has been the first responders showing up.' Texas law bans guns in schools unless the school has given written authorization. Arizona and six other states have similar laws with exceptions for people who have licenses to carry concealed weapons. Harrold's school board voted unanimously in 2007 to allow employees to carry weapons. After obtaining a state concealed-weapons permit, each employee who wants to carry a weapon must be approved by the board based on his or her personality and reaction to a crisis, Thweatt said. Power: David Thweatt is the only man who knows which of the teachers are legally allowed to carry weapons at Harrold Independent School District . Unaware: While it is not sure if Craig carries a weapons - he told CNN he does not know which of his staff carry guns . The identities of the armed staff members are known only by the superintendent and not the students. 'Wilbarton county is roughly the size of Rhode Island. That is a lot of square mileage to be covered. Thirty minutes waiting for a first responder is an extremely long time when it comes to a school shooting,' said Thweatt. 'We really didn't have any choice but to come up with some plan where we could be our first responder much as we are in our homes.' 'We know who the good people are, who the bad people are and we are going to be able to assess very quickly what's going on. 'If a sheriff was to come in they don't know who the bad guys are' Teachers also must undergo training in crisis intervention and hostage situations. And they must use bullets that minimize the risk of ricochet, similar to those carried by air marshals on planes. 'We focused on accuracy in our training and hostage situations,' said Thweatt. 'After Sandy Hook, I have been contacted by I can't tell you how many school leaders, how can I do this in my community?' Decision: The Virginia Tech massacre was the tipping point for the school board in Texas to arm their teachers . 'We would rather have guns protect us than rulers and pencils.' The students are whole-heartedly behind the idea . In interviews with the Associated Press just after Sandy Hook, CaRae Reinisch, who lives in the nearby community of Elliott, said she took her children out of a larger school and enrolled them in Harrold two years ago, partly because she felt they would be safer in a building with armed teachers. 'I think it's a great idea for trained teachers to carry weapons,' Reinish said. 'But I hate that it has come to this.' The superintendent won't disclose how many of the school's 50 employees carry weapons, saying that revealing that number might jeopardize school security. The school, about 150 miles northwest of Fort Worth near the Oklahoma border, has 103 students from kindergarten through 12th grade. Most of them rarely think about who is carrying a gun. 'This is the first time in a long time that I've thought about it,' said Matt Templeton, the principal's 17-year-old son. 'And that's because of what happened' in Connecticut. Thweatt said other Texas schools allow teachers to carry weapons, but he would not reveal their locations, saying they are afraid of negative publicity. The Texas Education Agency said it had not heard of any other schools with such a policy. 'When they decided to go with the policy there were things happening in the world,' said Principal Craig Templeton. 'If a gun is fired in a school, you want a person who will go to the gunfight not away from the gunfight.' 'I have heard the argument that teachers aren't police. But I would rather be able to call a parent and say your child is fine. That (the opposite) is something that I am not prepared to live with.","Teachers in Harrold Independent School District carry concealed weapons .

"There is a South American takeover going on in Manchester. They might like the taste of a Manchester Egg, or the feel of drizzly rain so thick it soaks you through. Or perhaps Oasis are big on that side of the Atlantic. Whatever the answer, South Americans are flocking to a city in the North West of England. The Manchester derby on Sunday will bring together potentially 11 players from South America at United and City, ranging from Argentina to Brazil to Colombia. The Manchester City and United likely starting XIs for the derby with South Americans highlighted . There could well be a record set for the most amount of South Americans starting a Premier League match – currently standing at seven in the fixture between Manchester City and Tottenham last year. The record amount to feature over the course of a game is eight, when United played QPR earlier this season. Sportsmail takes a look at who they are and who is most likely to have the biggest impact on the match... Sergio Aguero (Argentina) - City . The striker has fired two blanks in his last two matches, but that has barely put a dent in his scintillating goalscoring form this season. Eleven goals in 13 appearances in all competitions, eight in his last seven, joint-top scorer in the Premier League with Diego Costa. He will be favourite to net the winner. Sergio Aguero has been in good form for Manchester City and celebrates scoring against Tottenham . Angel di Maria (Argentina) - United . Seven games into his Manchester United career and Di Maria is already proving to be the man to pull the strings from midfield for his side – as well as wading in with three goals. The £60million summer signing will be crucial to United's chances of beating their bitter rivals. Argentina star Angel di Maria (left), who has reinvigorated Manchester United, tries to beat Nemanja Matic . Radamel Falcao (Colombia) - United . We are yet to see much of the frightening finishing of the forward since he joined United, with only one goal so far. But those who have played with Falcao speak of one of the most lethal penalty area strikers. There is a reason the 28-year-old has commanded more than £100m in fees. Radamel Falcao could return from injury to play in his first Manchester derby . Fernandinho (Brazil) - City . The Brazilian has been shouldering the burden of Yaya Toure's passive displays this season. His box-to-box running has tried to create the energy to drive City forward as well as providing cover at the back. They will need him to run tirelessly, yet again, if Toure fails to perform. Brazilian midfielder Fernandinho is likely to partner Yaya Toure in midfield for City . Analysts Bloomberg Sports predict that a Man City win is the most likely outcome against Man United . Pablo Zabaleta (Argentina) - City . On his day, Zabaleta can be as dangerous as any winger from right back. He has the stamina to get up and down that flank for the entire 90 minutes and pose a real threat to United's goal, as well as proving just as difficult to beat at the back. Pablo Zabaleta (right) will be a threat for City up and down the flank . Marcos Rojo (Argentina) - United . Questions have been asked of the defender's ability since Louis van Gaal brought him in to help the club's defensive problems. He will face another huge task up against Aguero on Sunday. If he is not on top of his game, it could be an embarrassing afternoon. Marcos Rojo (left) has started the last two games at centre back for Manchester United . Rafael (Brazil) - United . The Brazilian has been preferred at right back since Van Gaal switched to playing four at the back instead of three with two wing backs. At times, he can be a real aid to United's attack, picking out team-mates with crosses. But by equal measure, he can be a liability, too. Which Rafael will turn up? Brazilian defender Rafael, challenging Eden Hazard, has been the first choice right back for Louis van Gaal . Fernando (Brazil) - City . Unlikely that he will start at the same time as Fernandinho, but if he plays, Fernando will be required to put in the same hard graft as his international counterpart. Yet to prove his worth since moving from Porto in the summer. Manchester City's Fernando, in action at West Ham, is unlikely to start on Sunday alongside Fernandinho . Martin Demichelis (Argentina) - City . Demichelis appears to be getting edged out of the team by summer signing Eliaquim Mangala but the new man's inconsistent displays for City mean the Argentine could be due to start at centre back in such an important match. Often the target for flak, Demichelis was an asset for City in their title-winning campaign last season and could yet frustrate United. Martin Demichelis could come into the City starting XI to replace Eliaquim Mangala . Willy Caballero (Argentina) - City . Extremely unlikely he will play and is instead expected to watch from the bench. The goalkeeper has only been preferred once to Joe Hart in the league, against Hull, and has conceded seven goals in his four appearances in all competitions. Goalkeeper Willy Caballero played for City during their home Capital One Cup defeat by Newcastle . Antonio Valencia (Ecuador) - United . Valencia is recovering from a hamstring injury which ruled him out of their 1-1 draw with Chelsea. But he has been back in training with United and Van Gaal often called on him at the start of the season. This game will perhaps come too early for a starting place. Valencia missed last week's game with Chelsea due to a hamstring injury - but could be fit for Sunday .","Angel di Maria, Rafael and Marcos Rojo should start for Manchester United at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday .

"People traffickers brought women to Britain on £10,000-a-year student aid packages before forcing them into prostitution, a court heard. Romanian authorities say they have uncovered a scam on British taxpayers, who unwittingly fund thugs and pimps to come here posing as students. The pimps then use the same racket to bring in women who are coerced into becoming prostitutes. Alex Mandache (circled top right), investigated over allegations he had taken girlfriend Mariana Lungu to the UK before forced her into prostitution. He is also alleged to have helped friend Andrei Ciacaru (circled bottom right) bring his prostitute girlfriend to Britain (pair are pictured with unnamed people not connected to case) The scam emerged a day after watchdogs laid bare abuses of the student loan system following an expansion in private colleges. The National Audit Office found more than £5million was paid in error to 992 EU students. Romanian builder Alex Mandache, 32, was accused by ex-girlfriend Mariana Lungu, 24, of luring her to Britain with the promise of a college place. Romanian prosecutors said: ‘She alleges that when she was there he forced her into prostitution.’ Mandache told police he had been a student at St Patrick’s College in London, but prosecutors said: ‘Given that he didn’t even manage to gain a high school-leaving certificate, it seemed extremely dubious.’ Investigators found that dozens known to police as prostitutes and thugs had become students in Britain. When asked to prove eligibility for financial aid, they simply said they would provide documents later. They then pocketed the money – and failed to produce any paperwork. Prosecutors quizzed Mandache and demanded to know what he had been doing in the UK, and were shocked when he claimed to be a student at St Patrick's College in west London . Mandache arrived in Britain in 2007 and in 2012 enrolled at St Patrick’s, where he received £10,250 a year in aid. He helped friends to enrol, charging each a £1,000 fee, the authorities said. Miss Lungu told police she had a fling with him in 2013, adding: ‘The relationship cooled, but then he offered to bring me to Britain.’ Officials say he also brought in a friend, Andrei Ciacaru, and his girlfriend, a prostitute. Ciacaru told them: ‘I paid him £1,000. He enrolled me into management or business studies – something like that. Each student received £10,000 a year.’ St Patrick’s said it could not comment for legal reasons, but added: ‘The statement that the college is in any way involved in helping any students... to apply for student support is entirely without foundation. 'All students go through a rigorous admissions process, which involves personal interviews.’ The Department for Business said it was continuing to tighten rules for private colleges.","Alex Andrei Mandache, 32, was handed £10,250-a-year to study in UK .

"International titles and adoration can go to a person's head but a Spanish soldier who was voted one of the hottest men in the world is determined to keep his boots on the ground. Despite winning the Mr Universe title recently, Ruben Lopez has vowed to continue learning and stick with his career in the army instead of seeking bigger or better things. Mr Lopez, who was born in Navas de San Juan, defeated 40 participants from all over the world to be crowned Mr Universe last September in Lima, Peru. Uniform: Ruben Lopez, who is the newly crowned Mr Universe, buttons up his shirt during the brief video . The 22 year-old joined the Spanish Army in 2011 and he was subsequently posted in the Armoured Brigade Guadarrama XII at the El Goloso military base in Madrid. Mr Lopez, was assigned to the RBA Section (telecommunications) from the Signals Company. Despite having being named the most handsome man in the world, Mr López has no intention of giving up his army profession. He has been studying for his degree in physical education and working as a model. In 2013, the military man won the Beauty of Spain contest. Duties: Mr Lopez speaks on the telephone during his daily shift in the Armoured Brigade Guadarrama XII unit . Weights: Mr Lopez does some bench pressing at the El Goloso military base in Madrid . In a brief video that provides a glimpse into his day job, Mr Lopez said he is just another person to those who know him. The soldier said: 'I am still the same and I will be. Here in my work I am still just one more soldier. I still need to make efforts day by day and keep learning and improving.' The new Mr Universe, who has worked in the fashion industry since he was 14 years old, is treated as 'just another soldier' even though he is very handsome, according to female soldier Lorena Pozas Martin. Artillery: Mr Lopez stops to allow a tank to pass him in the military barracks . Exercise: Mr Lopez does some push-ups (left) while he does some jogging (right) during his army training . She said: 'He is one more among us but we have that feeling of ""Wow, we are working with Mr Universe!"" But, I don’t know, he is just one of us.' During the video Mr Lopez can be seen doing push-ups, running with colleagues, lifting weights, and putting on his boots, shirt and beret. The soldier can also be seen drinking coffee with colleagues, putting stairs on a military vehicle, working with an antenna and watching a leopard tank passing by.","Ruben Lopez won the Mr Universe title in Lima, Peru last month .

"It’s estimated we threw away £64 million worth of food over the festive season. But Christmas isn’t the only time we are wasteful. A recent government-funded study suggests many British families unwittingly throw away the equivalent of 24 meals a month, worth £60. Here, Mandy Francis offers clever tips to stretch the contents of your fridge and larder further. Scroll down for video . RE-CRISP YOUR CRISPS . Breakfast cereals can be revitalised by a ten-second blast in the microwave . Stale crisps, breakfast cereals and crackers can be revived with a couple of quick, ten-second blasts in the microwave until they crisp up again. Alternatively, five minutes in a hot oven will also give them back some crunch. Hard loaves of bread can be zapped in the microwave, too — wrap in a slightly damp paper towel and heat for ten seconds, or until the loaf feels soft again. You can also pop stale cake slices in the microwave for 20 seconds to restore their normal texture. Dry slices of bread can be cut into small squares and baked in the oven to make croutons. Sprinkle the cubes with olive oil and season with salt and pepper or dried herbs, then place them into a hot oven and cook until they brown off and all moisture from the bread has evaporated. They are best used straight away, sprinkled on soups. Old bread slices can also be tossed in a food processor to make breadcrumbs for coating fish or meat, or you can add herbs and use the crumbs in stuffing recipes. TURN CREAM INTO BUTTER . Make the most out of your left over double cream and turn it into butter! Stuck with a large pot of double cream nearing its use-by date? Darina Allen, one of Ireland’s top cookery writers, suggests a surprisingly easy recipe for turning it into lovely, creamy, home-made butter. Beat the cream with an electric mixer for five to seven minutes until it separates into a mix of solid butterfat globules (curds) and liquid buttermilk (whey). Separate the curds from the whey over a big bowl using a sieve. Beat the curds again for a few minutes and sieve to ensure you have removed all the liquid. Cover the curds with very cold water and squeeze to get the last dregs of whey out. Drain and wash twice more with cold water before shaping into a ball or slab. Put your butter on a sheet of greaseproof paper and roll up ready for use. It can be frozen, too. SCRAPE YOUR JARS . Add olive oil to a mayonnaise jar to create a delicious creamy salad dressing . Don’t waste those last scrapings of spreads and condiments in the bottom of glass jars. Add a little olive oil, vinegar and herbs to an almost empty mayonnaise jar, replace the lid and give it a shake to create a delicious, creamy salad dressing. A few slugs of olive oil added to a smeary pesto jar will create a delicious dressing, or give you basil-flavoured oil to add to your cooking. And warm milk poured into a Nutella jar and shaken will turn chocolate spread smears into a bedtime drink. TURN FLOPPY VEG INTO STOCK . Freeze your unused, clean and chopped veg, wait until the bag is full, boil and blitz it for some delicious soup . Keep a large plastic bag in the freezer and throw in rinsed and chopped vegetable ‘leftovers’. Once the bag is full, defrost these leftovers, then add a cooked onion, garlic, water and herbs. Boil for 20 minutes and then strain to make a stock or liquidise to make a soup. Both can be used immediately or frozen in one pint portions until needed. EKE OUT CHEESE . Grate a freeze your leftover cheese to give it a longer shelf life, it tends to crumble in the freezer so use it on top of pasta or for a cheese sauce . Found more cheese than you can eat in your fridge? Grate and freeze it to extend its shelf life. Cheese tends to turn crumbly in the freezer, so use it over pasta and in cheese sauces or quiches once thawed. CREATE HERB BOUQUETS . Snip the bottom of the herb's stalks and put them in a small vase of water to extend their shelf life . Don’t put packs of fresh herbs or bunches of watercress in the fridge. Extend their life by snipping off the bottom centimetre of the stalks as soon as you get them home and placing them in a glass or small vase of fresh water — just like fresh flowers — on the kitchen counter. Change the water every couple of days and they’ll last for weeks. Alternatively, you can invest in a Prepara Savor Herb Pod (£27.80, amazon.co.uk). These are transparent plastic pods, in which you can stand your herbs or asparagus. Simply fill the base with water and shut the lid before placing in the door of your fridge. Top up the water reservoir as necessary and your herbs should stay fresh for up to three weeks. CLEVER CUBES . Ice cube trays (the ones with extra-large compartments are best) can be incredibly useful for preserving leftovers. Fill them with any of the following, then decant the loose cubes into freezer bags to use as needed. Freeze red or white wine in an ice cube tray and use them in stews or sauces for extra flavour . STORE ONIONS IN YOUR TIGHTS . Tie up onions in a pair of old tights for easy storage and to extend their lifespan . Tie onions individually into the legs of an old but clean pair of tights (tie a knot in the tights between each one), then hang them up in a cool, dry, well-ventilated spot to extend the vegetables’ lifespan. KNOW YOUR NANAS . Frozen banana pieces can be blended together with milk for a delicious milkshake . One minute your bananas are a bit too green to eat, the next time you look they’ve turned brown and unappetising. Of course, you can use overripe ones to make banana bread, but otherwise you can simply chop them up and freeze for later use. Frozen banana pieces blended with milk make a delicious milkshake, or you can just process the frozen pieces on their own to make a healthy ‘ice cream’. SALAD SECRETS . Pop a kitchen towel in with your salad to soak up excess moisture and keep it fresher for longer . Bagged salad leaves are one of our worst vices when it comes to food wastage. Pop a folded, paper kitchen towel in the bag before you reseal it; this will absorb excess moisture and keep the leftover salad fresh for longer. Keep as much of your cucumber as you can covered in its plastic cover. According to the Cucumber Growers Association, shrink-wrapped cucumber will stay fresh up to three times longer than the unwrapped version. Wrapping celery in aluminium foil and storing it in the fridge will keep it crisp for a minimum of two weeks. Foil works with celery because it preserves the vegetable’s moisture, but — because it’s not an airtight seal like cling film — allows any ethylene, the gas that causes fruit and veg to ripen and then rot, to escape.

Christmas isn't the only time of year this is an issue though .
Here Mandy Francis offers some tips for keeping food fresher for longer .
A large pot of yogurt that’s almost reached its use-by date can be frozen into cubes to be added to smoothies and sauces, or defrosted to top a fresh fruit dessert at a later date.
Crack open spare eggs, beat them with a little salt or sugar to stabilise the yolks and then freeze the raw egg mixture in an ice cube tray. Use within six months for omelettes, scrambled eggs and baking.
White or red wine can be frozen in an ice cube tray, then dropped into homemade stews or sauces for added flavour.
If you have handfuls of fresh herbs left after a recipe, chop them finely, mix with olive oil or melted butter and freeze. Your herb cubes will work perfectly in omelettes, stews and sauces."
"Royal Mail boss Moya Greene suffered a humiliating blow after a watchdog rubbished claims that Britain’s six-day-a-week postal service was under threat. Ofcom said evidence failed to support ‘pessimistic’ claims by Royal Mail that increased competition from rivals would put the national delivery service at risk. The regulator refused to restrict competitors, and instead turned the tables, announcing a review into Royal Mail’s efficiency. Shares in the firm fell 3 per cent within hours of yesterday’s announcement. It revealed it would not impose new conditions on Royal Mail's  competitors like Amazon and TNT, in a blow to the postal service. Royal Mail was dealt a fresh blow after regulator Ofcom said it would not impose new conditions on the firm's direct-delivery competitors . Business Secretary Vince Cable hit back at claims from Moya Greene, Royal Mail's chief executive, that the the universal delivery service was being threatened by rival firms taking lucrative work in big cities . It came after Vince Cable last week warned Royal Mail to stop 'scaremongering'. The Business Secretary said the firm - part-owned by the taxpayer - must stop 'whinging' about competition from rival companies 'cherry-picking' the delivery of letters and parcels in high density areas. It comes after Moya Greene, Royal Mail's chief executive, told MPs that the 'precious' universal service obligation is under threat with competitors undermining her firm's economics. Last month profits in Royal Mail slumped after Amazon shook up the parcels market by setting up its own delivery network. Royal Mail profits fell from £353 million to £279 million. The universal service obligation cost £7.2 billion a year because of the high cost of delivering post to rural and remote areas of the UK. Giving evidence to the business select committee, Ms Greene said: 'The universal service is a precious service. It its essential for most people in Britain and it has a fixed cost.' She said: 'It requires a number of internal subsidies in order to make the economics work. 'So for example, the low cost urban areas are needed - and mail that's high density and high volume mail are needed - to cross-subsidise the suburban and rural areas which are much higher cost. 'If you allow cherry-picking in urban areas you undermine the economics. It siphons off very quickly a lot of revenue. It makes the universal service uneconomic. 'Unlike many universal services in the world, we do not require or rely on government subsidy.' But Ofcom said that competition from rivals will make the postal service more efficient. Ofcom chief executive Ed Richards said today: ‘Ofcom's board has considered all the evidence in the postal market carefully over the past few months. We have concluded that there is no present risk to the financial sustainability of the universal service.’ Rivals Whistl and UK Mail deny they are cherry-picking work, or that they threaten the universal service. Business Secretary Vince Cable last week warned Royal Mail to stop 'scaremongering' over its same-price delivery obligation . Royal Mail was part privatised last year in a controversial sell-off which critics claimed saw shares bought on the cheap. Royal Mail has lost 50,000 staff in the last decade, and is shedding 2-3,000 jobs a year. Letter deliveries are falling by around 4-6 per cent a year and competitors taking business off the Royal Mail in urban areas was making the universal service 'uneconomic'. As well as competition, postal workers were delivering to more and more addresses, while the number of letters was declining. As the UK's 'universal service' provider, Royal Mail is required to provide access to competitors such as TNT for final mile deliveries. Postal regulator Ofcom is investigating a complaint from TNT over Royal Mail's decision to change conditions and increase the prices it charges to deliver post collected and pre-sorted by its competitors.","Royal Mail had claimed that its universal service was in jeopardy .
