"A leading opera star who is appearing on stage in a highly sexualised part has taken a swipe at Miley Cyrus for her provocative twerking. Danielle de Niese said her appearance in Francesco Cavalli's bawdy opera La Calisto at the Bayerische Staatsoper in Munich, Germany, is an example of opera encouraging performers to embrace their sexuality. But, when talking about the American singer's dance at the MTV Music Video Awards, the soprano said it was an example of a singer using her sexuality for the wrong reasons. Bawdy: Danielle de Niese dressed in as skimpy leotard for her appearance in Francesco Cavalli's opera La Calisto at the Bayerische Staatsoper in Munich, Germany . Controversial: Miley Cyrus and Robin Thicke perform Blurred Lines during the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards in New York . In an interview with The Times, she said: 'I have different reactions based on . the way it is presented. 'It's tough [for Cyrus] because you . have someone who's desperately trying to artistically express herself . and break free from the shell of her previous image that was curated for . her by Disney when she was Hannah Montana. 'To break free from that she's felt that she needed to really go in the other direction.' De Niese said her appearance on stage in a leopard-print leotard is different because she is portraying a wild character. Danielle de Niese (pictured) said Miley Cyrus was an example of a singer using her sexuality for the wrong reasons . Danielle de Niese in L'Incoronazione di Poppea performed at Glyndebourne Opera in East Sussex . 'When it comes to myself, I am an actor - I am somebody who uses my face and body as a canvas to make a character come to life.. But she added that she would not do a concert performance 'in a mesh leotard' because that would be 'inappropriate'. The . artist, who has performed at the Royal Opera House and Glyndebourne, told The Times she would do it . for 'artisitic integrity', but not 'for the sake of it'. She added that she admired the American singer Beyonce because she showed how sexuality can be more than provocation without being 'crass or rude'. De Niese's remarks come after Nicola Benedetti, the violinist who won awards for Best Female Artist at the Classical Brits two years running, said that she had declined requests for provocative photo shoots. She told the BBC's Desert Island Discs radio programme: 'There's not even a point in asking me.'","Danielle de Niese said her appearance in La Calisto was different .

"Karl Bestford will serve a minimum of 22 years in prison . A former slaughterman has been sentenced to life imprisonment after murdering his landlord and mutilating the body because he was asked about rent arrears. Karl Bestford, 35, stabbed to death Simon Meech at his rented flat in Bensham, Gateshead. He denied the charge but a jury at Newcastle Crown Court took two hours to deliver a guilty verdict yesterday. The court heard how Bestford had argued with his wife on July 28 about his seven months of rent arrears and debts of £11,000 after two county court judgements. Bestford had been due a visit from Mr Meech the next day to collect rent but the arrangement was changed . to 9.30pm that night. Bestford stabbed Mr Meech ten times in his living room with a kitchen knife and mutilated his body before fleeing the scene in his landlord’s car. He travelled towards Carlisle, where his wife was staying, but pulled over, rang 999 and told police: 'I’ve slaughtered him, I don’t know what to do.' He later rang police again and claimed Mr Meech had pulled a knife on him during . a row. He said he had grabbed it off him and stabbed him. He told police: 'I just saw red and I stabbed and stabbed and stabbed him.' When police got to the scene, Mr . Meech’s head was partially detached and his feet and calves had been . wrapped in a bin liner while his legs were tied together with parcel . tape. PC Sarah Curry was . among the officers who arrived at the flat. She said there was blood all over the flat, although it appeared attempts had been made to clean it up. She told the court: 'I saw a . man lying on his back on the kitchen floor. 'His lower legs from the knees down, including his feet, were covered in black bin bags which were wrapped round.' Pathologist Dr Mark Egan told Newcastle Crown Court: 'Most of the wounds to the neck occurred after the heart had stopped beating. 'There . was a clot in the blood vessels of the neck which raised the . possibility at least one of the wounds was inflicted in life. 'It would have been apparent to the person whether he was alive or dead.' Police found Mr Meech with gruesome fatal injuries when they responded to Bestford's 999 call . He added Mr Meech had suffered stab wounds to his torso and face and other knife injuries to his arm, leg and palm. The court heard Mr Meech, from Whickham, Gateshead, was a district manager for Blockbuster who had built up a portfolio of eight properties which he rented out. He had a young son to his long-term partner and was described in . court as a 'model landlord' by tenants in the other properties he rented . out. Bestford, who was working for a . distribution company at the time, was renting one of those properties on . Rayleigh Grove for £395 a month. Mr Meech had allowed debt-ridden Bestford to get away without paying his rent for seven months and was owed £2,765. Following the guilty verdict, Detective Chief Inspector Paul Young, who led the murder inquiry, said: 'This was a savage attack on a respectable member of the community who was simply going about his business. 'A dedicated team of detectives carried out a detailed investigation and this conviction means a dangerous and violent man will be off the streets for a considerable time. 'Our thoughts remain with Mr Meech’s family and friends who have shown great dignity throughout the investigation and I would like to thank them for their assistance.' Karl Bestford stabbed and mutilated his landlord Simon Meech after a discussion about his £2,765 rent arrears . Mr Meech’s family issued a statement after the trial, paying tribute to him, which said: 'Simon was an incredible man, so deeply loved by all his family and friends. 'Our loss of him in July 2012 completely devastated our lives and left us utterly heartbroken. 'We would like to thank everyone who has, and continues to support us through this horrendous time, as well as Northumbria Police who have shown incredible professionalism and compassion towards the case and our family. 'We have been left with such a painful emptiness in our lives that anyone who knew Simon would know the extent of. 'Simon’s children have been robbed of the most wonderful father - to us this is far and above the most painful and tragic part of our loss.' Sentencing Bestford to 22 years' imprisonment Mr Justice Coulson said: 'I reject completely that there was any threat of any kind from Mr Meech. 'You attempted to cut off one of his limbs. Worst of all you attempted to cut off his head. As someone who had worked in an abattoir, you must have known precisely what you were doing. 'His head was only attached to his body by the skin and the muscle at the back of his neck. Killing Mr Meech was senseless.' The judge listed a number of aggravating factors. Addressing the defendant he added: 'These included an element of planning, the use of a weapon, the fact a weapon was a large kitchen knife from your own kitchen, the suffering of Mr Meech when you stabbed him numerous times and the attempts to cover up what you had done. 'Stabbing him twice to the face and once to the back was in my view only explicable by an intention to kill your victim.' 'You will serve 22 years in prison before you are even considered for release.'","Ex slaughterman Karl Bestford, 35, murdered 'model landlord' Simon Meech .

"A Florida man was arrested Tuesday after authorities say he fatally shot a man , as well as shooting a 7-year-old boy - thankfully, the boy lived. Brandon Hawkins has a long history of problems with his girlfriend's family, but according to investigators, what finally pushed him over the edge was a sandwich from a Port St. Lucie Burger King. 'The wrong sandwich was just another stressor in an already tense situation,' Port St. Lucie Police Chief John Bolduc told reporters on Wednesday. Earlier this week Florida man Brandon Hawkins  was arrested for allegedly shooting a man because he got the wrong order at Burger King . Authorities say Hawkins' relationship with Jamie Young has been strained recently, and the issues he's had with her family has been equally problematic. About a year ago, Young's brother fired a gun at Hawkins, police say, and on Tuesday Hawkins had gone to Young's home looking for her brother. 'There's a long history in the family of gunplay,' Port St. Lucie Police Lt. Scott Beck told WPBF. About 7 p.m. on Tuesday evening, police say Hawkins went to Young's home with a plan to kill her brother and than take his own life. Things didn't go according to plan. Rather than shooting Young's brother, Hawkins ended up shooting her mother's boyfriend, 69-year-old Levy Williams, and Young's 7-year-old son, Emmanuel Morgan Jr. as he and his mother tried to run to a neighbor's house to avoid the gunfire. A disgruntled customer threatened to 'shoot everyone' in a Burger King because it sold her a stale pasty . Williams died at a local hospital, and Morgan currently is in stable condition. Young was not injured in the attack. According to detectives, Hawkins showed no remorse when he was told Williams was dead. Neighbors and other witnesses described a chaotic scene at the home. 'The first couple (of shots) sounded more like fireworks, then all of a . sudden a few minutes later, I could hear, ""Pow, pow, pow, pow,'"" said a . neighbor who preferred to remain anonymous. Hawkins remained on the loose for several hours after the shooting, causing residents in the neighborhood to fear that he could attack them next. 'When they said he was still on the loose, I said we better lock all our . doors and windows because we don't know where he's hiding,' neighbor Samori Williams told the local news station. 'He could be in anybody's backyard. It's no joke; anybody can hide.' Crime scene: Hawkins went to the home of his girlfriend (pictured) with the intention of killing her brother and then himself . Detectives tracked Hawkins down at another girlfriend's house a few miles away from the crime scene at about 1 a.m. Hawkins was booked into the St. Lucie County Jail about 5:30 a.m. on several felony charges, including first-degree murder. He's been ordered held without bail.","Brandon Hawkins killed his girlfriend's mother's boyfriend and shot her 7-year-old son .

"British police forces will be forced to hand sensitive details of criminal investigations to Brussels or risk a massive fine. In a controversial move, the European Union’s crime intelligence agency would be allowed to demand access to private police files. Europol could insist chief constables disclose evidence from criminal cases, witness statements, DNA samples, fingerprints and other data. Controversial: British police forces will be forced to hand sensitive details of criminal investigations to Brussels or risk a massive fine . The UK would not be able to block a request – even if it harmed national security or jeopardised an ongoing investigation. It raises the prospect of corrupt or incompetent police officers or officials in other countries allowing compromising information to fall into the hands of criminals. The proposal would also put huge operational strain on forces as they would be ordered to divert resources from tackling crime to information-gathering for Brussels. If the UK refused to comply, it could be hit with a £220million-a-year fine. Concerned critics warned . the move, which would cost £62million a year, was a step nearer a single . European criminal justice system. Tory . MP Dominic Raab said: ‘This plan lays bare the federalist ambition of . moving towards a single European criminal justice system, shorn of . proper national democratic control. Concerns: In a controversial move, the European Union's crime intelligence agency would be allowed to demand access to private police files . ‘If you don’t trust the Whitehall machine to look after your personal details, it will be a massive liability if it is sent to places that are rife with corruption and incompetence.’ The proposals were sneaked out by the European Commission in a 109-page document with the title European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Co-operation and Training. They would expand the powers of Europol, the agency set up by the EU in 1999 to share intelligence, crime-fighting techniques and bolster cross-border police co-operation.

"This is the dramatic moment a diver in the Bahamas had a very close encounter with a fearsome lemon shark. The 2.5metre long fish is shown baring a menacing set of teeth as it breaks the surface at Tiger Beach during sunrise. Photographer Andrew Murch captured the shots during an eventful dive when the lemon sharks suddenly appeared within millimeters of his camera. Up close and personal: The lemon shark bares its razor sharp teeth to the camera in these dramatic shots . Jaw-dropping: The lemon shark was pictured breaking the surface of the water at Tiger Beach in the Bahamas . Fearless: Photographer Andrew Murch captured these images during a dramatic dive with lemon sharks . Several of the dangerous sharks appeared fascinated by their aquatic companion and decided to take a closer look. The results are these beautiful images which couldn't paint are more intimate picture of one of the sea's most feared creatures. Andrew said: 'It’s a difficult moment to . capture because it is unusual to see sharks breaking the surface but at . Tiger Beach in the Bahamas the sharks get very excited around divers and . make very close passes.' Surprisingly, Andrew,from Victoria, Canada, has never once been bitten throughout his dangerous expeditions underwater. And he doesn’t even take precautions when underwater with the sharks. He explained: 'I didn't feel the need for chainmail or other armour but I . always wear a dark wetsuit and dark gloves just in case the sharks . mistake my hands for bait. I also try to stay calm and avoid erratic . jerky movements that might be interpreted as an animal in distress.' Almost finished: The lemon sharks appeared naturally curious of the cameraman Andrew Murch . Underwater friend: Lemon sharks have been known to attack humans but none have been fatal . 'The shark seemed wary of me but tolerated my presence. I say tolerated . because it clearly outranked me from a size perspective. I believe that . the shark thought of me as another predator; albeit a clumsy one with . strange flashing appendages.' Andrew, who runs diving adventures company Big Fish Expeditions, came so . close to the sharks on this dive he said they were touching his . equipment. 'The lemons were practically bouncing off my underwater camera, but they . showed no aggressiveness towards me during this photo shoot,' he said. 'They have never shown me any hostility. After nearly two decades of . swimming with sharks, it has become quite clear to me that they are not . interested in divers as a food source. We generally bring bait to . attract the sharks to the boat and thats the only reason they come so . close.' The lemon shark, which is found in tropical waters around the Caribbean and west Africa, derives its name from its distinctive yellow colouring. Although the species has been known to attack humans, none have been fatal and they generally survive well in captivity.","Lemon sharks measuring up to 2.5metres pictured in the Bahamas .

"Smoking prevalence among England's adult population is set to drop below 20 per cent for the first time in a century . Smoking among England's adult population is set to drop below 20 per cent for the first time in a century, it was revealed today. An ongoing survey of tobacco use is expected to show the turning point being crossed by the end of this year. The proportion of smokers in England dipped as low as 20.1 per cent in 2011, when the last yearly results from the survey were published, but never quite reached the 'psychologically significant' 20 per cent watermark. Researchers plan to publish more figures at the end of this year. Unless there is a highly unlikely U-turn in the current trend, they will show that less than a fifth of people in England now smoke. Professor Robert West, from University College London, who co-heads the Smoking Toolkit Study, said: ‘2013 is going to be, almost without doubt, the first year for a hundred years where we're solidly below 20 per cent smoking prevalence in England. It's going to be a big year. ‘We are making progress. It's slow, and we'd like it to be quicker, but things are going in the right direction.’ The Smoking Toolkit Study tracks smoking habits in adults over the age of 16 every month and publishes the results online. Researchers conduct household surveys to collect information from around 1,800 people. Currently, it shows that average smoking prevalence across England is 19.1 per cent, with a marked difference between populations at the top and the bottom of the socio-economic scale. Among those in the upper and middle A, B and C1 social brackets, only around 13 per cent smoke. But tobacco is part of the lives of more than a quarter of people classified as C2, D and E. Tobacco use is recognised as the single biggest cause of preventable disease and early death in the UK, claiming more than 102,000 lives a year. Smoking causes around 86 per cent of deaths from lung cancer, 80 per cent of deaths from bronchitis and emphysema, and 17 per cent of deaths from heart disease. In 1948, when smoking surveys began, 82 . per cent of men in the UK were smokers. Smoking prevalence fell rapidly . between the 1970s and 1990s after which it has continued a slow decline. Smoking causes around 86 per cent of deaths from lung cancer (pictured), 80 per cent of deaths from bronchitis and emphysema, and 17 per cent of deaths from heart disease . Professor West said the long term reduction in smoking prevalence showed no sign of coming to an end. ‘We don't see that happening in England,’ he said. ‘The decline now is between about 0.5 and one percentage point a year which is a pretty decent rate. There's no evidence that it's plateauing.’ He added that Government policies such as raising tobacco pricing, mass media campaigns and services to help smokers quit ‘definitely’ played a role in cutting tobacco consumption. He warned there was no room for complacency, as had been seen in France where no attempt was made to follow up a big hike in tobacco prices. Smoking rates dropped sharply for a time, but then prevalence started to rise again. ‘You definitely need to keep bearing down on it,’ Professor West added.","By the end of the year it's expected less than a fifth of Britons will smoke .

25% of people in the lower social brackets are smokers .

"Many will find these graphic pictures upsetting.

The skilled fishermen sail out on a wooden peledang, a wooden boat that can hold up to 14 men. The most agile stands on the bow armed with a . 'kefa'  - a bamboo pole with an iron-blade and knives. He then leaps from the boat, piercing the animal with the kefa before swimming back to collect another pole.

"According to Nielsen TV data through mid-January, the average age of Fox News viewers is 68-years-old. In Frank Rich's New York Magazine article, 'Stop Beating a Dead Fox' he calls Fox News a politically conservative 'retirement community' that's losing young viewers at a faster rate than it's competitors. The average viewers at MSNBC and CNN are 60, and the average is 62-64 for the broadcast networks. The average age of viewers that watch Fox News are 68-years-old and almost all of them are white . Not only are Fox News viewers old, . they're almost all white. Rich points out that only 1.1 per cent of Fox . News viewers are black. That's a far lower number than other news . networks. MSNCB has a 25 per cent black audience and CNN has 14 per cent black audience. Rich quips that conservative candidate Mitt Romney got more black voters at 2 per cent than Fox did at 1.1 per cent. Fox news has made some attempts at gaining younger viewers by hiring broadcasters such as the young, blonde, and blunt Megyn Kelley. However, Kelley failed to lure young viewers. In fact, most News networks are grasping to gain an audience from the generation that no longer hails TV as their primary news source. Most young people read the news on the web or on their smartphones as oppose to on television. Megyn also did nothing to draw a black audience, especially after she caused a raucous around Christmas when she said that both Santa Claus and Jesus were 'just white' on television in response to a piece Aisha Harris wrote for Slate.com expressing her desire to give Santa Clause a racial makeover. Fox personality Megyn Kelly caused controversy this Christmas when she said Jesus and Santa were 'just white' Fox News only has 1.1 per cent black viewers . Basically, Rich thinks Fox News caters to geriatric conservative white people and tells them exactly what they want to hear--especially politically. Rich explains that on Election day in 2012, election data (gathered by Fox News network favourite Scott Rassmusen proven to have GOP bias in 2010) was spiked in favour of Mitt Romney. Obama ended up winning the election. Even Romney's senior advisor, Eric Fehrnstrom, noted Fox's conservative favouritism.'We’d much rather go on a Fox program where we know the question is going to come up and Mitt can give his answer and it’s not going to a frenzy of questioning,' he said. Rich believes the age of Fox's conservative white viewers will continue to rise.

"Steven Gerrard took to Instagram on Sunday to deny any claims of a fallout between himself and Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers. The Liverpool captain was dropped by Rodgers for the game against Stoke at Anfield on Saturday despite it being the 16th anniversary of his debut for the club. Rodgers later claimed he wasn't aware of the landmark until he saw the commemorative match programme in the dressing room before their 1-0 win over Stoke. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Brendan Rodgers: I didn't realise it was Gerrard's 16th year . Steven Gerrard posted on his Instagram account to reveal there had been no rift with Brendan Rodgers . Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers said he had had no idea it was the 16th anniversary of Gerrard's debut . Gerrard posted a picture on Instagram of him and Rodgers smiling together with the caption: 'Just to set the record straight, media talk of a fall out between us 2 is NONSENSE. Have a nice Sunday.' The 34-year-old came on as a sub having been left out of the starting side against Stoke as Glen Johnson's 85th-minute winner gave Liverpool a much-needed win after three straight Premier League defeats. After the game on Saturday, Rodgers played down suggestions of a rift between himself and the Liverpool captain after leaving him out of the team. 'I spoke to him (Gerrard) on Friday and he didn't mention it so I felt bad when I saw about 20 pictures on the programme,' Rodgers said. 'Steven is in a part of his career when he is not going to play every minute of every game. The captain was on the pitch when the winner was scored by Glen Johnson five minutes from time .

"A woman had to be rescued by firefighters from the balcony of her fourth-floor flat after she was locked out. Fire crews and two engines were called to the incident at the Keppel Wharf development in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, and discovered the unidentified tenant was trapped outside. Passer-by Peter Alderson captured the moment the woman was rescued from the balcony while the road was closed to traffic. Operation: South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue had to extend a cherry picker up to the fourth floor of the building to help bring her down . He said: 'One of the firefighters told me that there's a fault with the locks in the building and has locked a few of its residents out in the past.' He added: 'I always have a camera with me because I work for Nikon, and I had just come out of Tesco and saw the firefighter climb over the balcony and put a harness on the woman. 'I got her to wave at me, she seemed fairly happy and ok with it all. 'There was a bit of a crowd gathering and cars were backed up as the road was blocked off.

"It is the star of New York's skyline. Now, for a cool $1 billion, it could be yours. The Empire State Building is going up for sale. No longer the world's tallest, but still the most iconic, the 102-storey skyscraper has been the subject of gushing poems, films and music since it emerged in 1931. And today, in a move that has sent the market into a frenzy, reports emerged that the Malkin family, owner of the legendary art deco tower, plans to let it go. Iconic: The 1931 art deco building was dwarfed by the World Trade Center in 1972 but remains legendary . Starting as early as this week, the multibillionaires will launch a 'roadshow' to pitch the sale to investors around the world. They hope to fetch $1 billion (£620,000,000) for the landmark and 17 other properties in what could be the second biggest public offering of real estate in American history. A breath-taking landmark and the star of King Kong, An Affair to Remember, and Sleepless in Seattle, the sale has 'sex appeal', realtor Joel Beam told Wall Street Journal. However, experts warn the building's highlight - the observatory deck - could be cast into shadow by the 104-storey One World Trade Center, set to emerge next door in 2015. The viewing point accounts for two thirds of its income. Visitors get an unrivaled view of New York . Competition: Experts warn the Empire State Building, left, will not attract the same number of visitors when the One World Trade Center, right, the world's third-tallest building, opens with dramatic views of the city . The One World Trade Center, built on the Ground Zero site of the fallen World Trade Center Towers, which were brought down in the September 11, 2001 terror attacks, officially surpassed the Empire State Building as the tallest building in New York in May. The One World Trade Center will stand at 1,776 feet to the tip of its antenna when it is completed in 2015. It will then be the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere and the third tallest building in the world. But this should not be an issue for investors, marketing analyst Michael Knott warned, as the building has an unusual amount of office space available for leasing. The Malkins won the support of their 2,800 stockholders in May to sell the building through an initial public offering (IPO), despite numerous offers from private investors. Once they have pitched to investors in major cities around the world, the family hopes to draw up a deal by the start of October through Bank of America and Goldman Sachs. Stardom: Shoedsack's 1933 thriller, King Kong. It catapulted the tower into film star status around the world . Meg Ryan's character touts the building as the most romantic place in the world in Sleepless in Seattle, 1993 . It is the spot where Deborah Kerr and Cary Grant plan to unite to live happily ever after in An Affair to Remember . It is expected to fall just shy of the biggest ever IPO - the sale of SingTel satellite unit in Singapore for $3 billion. Opened in May 1931 by President Hoover, the Empire State Building towered 200 feet over the city's tallest towers. Two years later, the skyscraper was catapulted into film star status with the release of King Kong. The film hinged on the dazzling height and glistening glamour of the building, as a screaming Fay Wray clung to the spire. This was the first of infinite tributes made to a building branded as 'the physical embodiment of the American dream'. F Scott Fitzgerald touted it as 'the most magnificent of towers' in My Lost City. Sleepless in Seattle hinges on the idea that the observatory deck is the most romantic place in the world. Meg Ryan's character in the 1993 film is enamoured with the tower on Fifth Avenue and 34th Street after seeing An Affair to Remember, starring Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr. In it, the lovers make a pact to meet at the top of the building in six months time to live happily ever after. It started as a plot of land inherited by the well-heeled Astor family who habitually demolished their mansions and replaced them with taller ones . It started as a competition between brothers. John Jacob Astor Jr and William Backhouse Astor inherited a plot each on Fifth Avenue - one cornered with 33rd street, the other with 34th. On 33rd, John erected a mansion in 1859. In 1862, his younger brother William trumped him with a bigger mansion next door - on 34th. In 1893, John's son, William Waldorf Astor, demolished their mansion and built the Waldorf Hotel. Four years later, in 1897, their family and neighbours razed their mansion to make way for the Astoria Hotel. The competition stopped there though, and in 1928, the Astoria was sold to an engineering corporation for $20 million. By 1930, a work force of 3,000 men would excavate the site and begin construction on New York's dazzling icon. Working at a rate of four-and-a-half stories a week, it seemed to leap into the air. In 1933, President Hoover pressed a gimmick button to turn on the lights of the building. Over time it has welcomed billions of visitors, sanctioned free-climbs of the tower (the first in 1937), and held Valentine's weddings (the first in 1994). It remained the tallest building in the world until 1972 when it was dwarfed by the World Trade Center. In 2002, Peter L Malkin, who already owned the 114-year lease on the tower, became the owner and manager when he bought the building.","Malkin family hope to get $1 billion through an initial public offering (IPO)

"Imagine swimming for more than seven hours straight - now imagine doing it without any arms or legs in shark and jellyfish infested waters. That's the incredible achievement of gutsy Frenchman Phillipe Croizon who had to have his lower limbs amputated when he suffered a freak 20,000 volt accident in 1994. The 43-year-old father-of-two battled against strong currents and tides to cross the 12 mile stretch of water between Oceania and Asia to complete the first stage of his mission to symbolically link the world's continents. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Delighted: Residents look on at the coastal village of Pasar Skow at Mr Croizon and his specially-adapted giant flippers which helped him to complete the tough swim . Wetsuit mishap: Croizon swum from Papua New Guinea to Indonesia in a customised wetsuit, pictured, but on the final journey, his specifically designed wetsuit for the arctic water did not fit and he was forced to wear a thin wetsuit in the icy water . After setting off from a fishing village named Wutung in Papua New Guinea he arrived at Pasar Skow in Indonesia seven hours, 35 minutes and 35 seconds later to be met by 100 villagers in tribal costumes yesterday. Back on dry land an exhausted Mr Croizon told an Agence France Presse ‘It was very, very hard. 'We took an hour and a half more than scheduled because of adverse currents. ‘I had to swim slowly because we had not reconnoitred the waters beforehand. We only received authorisation from the Indonesian authorities on Wednesday evening which left it too late.' Philippe was was joined by countryman and long distance sea swimmer Arnaud Chassery along with 29-year-old Wutung inhabitant Zet Zampa. Fan-tastic: An impressed supporter wraps his arm around the delighted 43-year-old who had avoided sharks and jellyfish in his brave effort . Making a splash: Croizon rests on the shore in the coastal village of Pasar Skow located in Indonesia after completing his swim from Oceania to Asia which took seven-and-a-half hours in May . He was also accompanied by a Zodiac dinghy on his swim and during the journey he came across both sharks and giant jellyfish. The limbless Frenchman first attracted worldwide attention after swimming across the English Channel two years ago in a time of just over 13 hours. He will embark on the second stage of his round the world challenge next month when he attempts to swim the 15 miles from Jordan’s Gulf of Aqaba in Asia to the Egyptian coast in Africa. Stage three, in July, will see him try and cross from Africa to Europe via the Straits of Gibraltar. The final stage in August will be across the freezing waters of the Bering Straits from an island in Russia to one in Alaska, U.S. No stopping him: Papuan villagers look on as Mr Croizon approaches the shore. The Frenchman lost his limbs when he suffered a 20,000 volt electric shock accident . New friends: The French swimmer is joined by scores of Papuan residents. He has now completed two stages of his mission to swim between each of the world's continents . Drinking to success: The disabled athlete takes a swig from a bottle of water after braving strong winds and currents during the swim from Papua New Guinea to Indonesia . To achieve the swims he uses specially adapted artificial legs fitted with giant flippers. The former electrical engineer lost the use of his lower limbs 18 years ago at the age of 26 when he suffered 20,000 volt electric shocks while changing a TV aerial. It is believed the first shock stopped his heart beating, while the second actually jolted it back into action and saved his life. Over a period of several months surgeons attempted to save his limbs but were eventually forced to amputate his arms and legs. A keen sportsman prior to his accident Philippe spent months in hospital followed by years of physical re-education. He has battled depression and despondency to return to the world of sporting achievement. Wheel deal: The Indonesian flag flies proudly above the chair of Mr Croizon's wheelchair.

"Counter-terrorism police are investigating the hacking of a rugby league team website which was replaced with a page featuring the message: 'I love you Isis'. The website of Rugby League team the Keighley Cougars was hacked last night and showed a black screen with the words 'Hacked By Team System DZ' at the top. A message posted on the West Yorkshire club's twitter feed said: 'Apologies, the website has been hacked. The developers are working on it. Will let you know when it's back up and running.' A screengrab of the Keighley Cougars' website after it was hacked with a pro-Isis message . The website has since been restored. Gary Fawcett, Keighley Cougars chairman, has expressed his shock at what he called the 'sinister hijacking' of club's website. The website featured text including the words 'i love you isis' and had a recording of music and singing in the background. The Chairman of Keighley Cougars has expressed his shock at what he called the 'sinister hijacking' The home ground of Keighley Cougars (pictured) who were the unlikely target of a pro-Isis hacking last night . A message on the hacked page 'to all the population and the government, especially' claimed the 'State of Islam' is expanding. Another screengrab of the hacked site. The message 'to all the population and the government, especially' claimed the 'State of Islam' is expanding . The site also featured images of fighter jets which it refers to as 'warplanes of making America', pictures of the wreckage of 'Muslim homes' and bloody images of people injured in fighting. One of the barely comprehensible messages left on the site said: 'The alliance of all the world against the State of Islam will not succeed.' Speaking to the Keighley News this morning, Mr Fawcett said: 'It's sinister what's happened and whatever organisation, wherever it is in the world should be using its own media, not hijacking other people's.' He told the paper he was most worried about youngsters and fans who follow the Cougars might be exposed to some of the horrific images that were on left on its site. 'It is a concern that children might see some of those nightmare images,' he said. He added that the website is hosted by a London company who were quickly contacted by one of the team's directors when the hacking came to light last night. A spokesman for West Yorkshire police said they had received a number of calls about the incident. 'We are aware of this incident and have now passed it to our counter-terrorism unit. 'We will work with the club in relation to this and are making enquiries.' Posting on social media, one person claimed a host server had been hacked, leading to 60 other websites featuring the same page. A resident of Keighley expressed concern over the financial details of those who have used the website. He posted: 'Are the bank details of people who have bought season tickets merchandise etc from the online shop safe?' Hackers Team System DZ came to attention in July when they hacked 200 websites and posted a series of anti-Israeli messages. A website which appears to log all of their successful hacking attempts shows they managed to hack into nearly 200 websites from across the world yesterday- and shows British websites received the brunt of their attentions. Last month they received international attention after they hacked into Canada's University of New Brunswick Student Union website using the same 'I love you Isis' header they used in this attack on the Keighley Cougars. According to the National Post the message left on the university's website said: 'The state of Islam and the list expands, God willing… this time is a time of Islam and victory and lift the injustice for Muslims and the elimination of America and the allies of the infidels will not keep silent.'","Rugby team's website was hacked last night by group Team System DZ .

"Ignorant: Adil Rashid (pictured) did not know it was illegal to have sex with a 13-year-old girl . A muslim who raped a 13-year-old girl . he groomed on Facebook has been spared a prison sentence after a judge . heard he went to an Islamic faith school where he  was taught that women . are worthless. Adil Rashid, 18, claimed he was not . aware that it was illegal for him to have sex with the girl because his . education left him ignorant of British law. Yesterday Judge Michael Stokes handed . Rashid a suspended sentence, saying: ‘Although chronologically 18, it is . quite clear from the reports that you are very naive and immature when . it comes to sexual matters.’ Earlier Nottingham Crown Court heard that . such crimes usually result in a four to seven-year prison sentence. But the judge said that because Rashid . was ‘passive’ and ‘lacking assertiveness’, sending him to jail might . cause him ‘more damage than good’. Rashid, from Birmingham, admitted he . had sex with the girl, saying he had been ‘tempted by her’ after they . met online. They initially exchanged messages on Facebook before sending . texts and chatting on the phone over a two-month period. They then met up in Nottingham, where Rashid had booked a room at a Premier Inn. The girl told police they stayed at . the hotel for two hours and had sex after Rashid went to the bathroom . and emerged wearing a condom. Rashid then returned home and went . straight to a mosque to pray. He was arrested the following week after . the girl confessed what had happened to a school friend, who informed . one of her teachers. He told police he knew the girl was 13 but said he was initially reluctant to have sex before relenting after being seduced. Encounter: Rashid and the girl had met randomly on Facebook and had also communicated by phone and text messages for two months before they met . Earlier the court heard how Rashid had . ‘little experience of women’ due to his education at an Islamic school . in the UK, which cannot be named for legal reasons. After his arrest, he told a . psychologist that he did not know having sex with a 13-year-old was . against the law. The court heard he found it was illegal only when he . was informed by a family member. In other interviews with . psychologists, Rashid claimed he had been taught in his school that . ‘women are no more worthy than a lollipop that has been dropped on the . ground’. When Judge Stokes said Rashid ‘must . have known it was illegal, unless he was going round with his eyes . shut’, defence lawyer Laban Leake said reports suggested Rashid had a . ‘degree of sexual naivety’. ‘The school he attended, it is not . going too far to say, can be described as a closed community and on this . occasion this was perpetuated by his home life. Rashid had pre-booked a family room at the Premier Hotel in Goldsmith Street, Nottingham where he took his victim . Sentenced: Rashid admitted at Nottingham Crown Court (pictured) that he had sex with a 13-year-old after she 'tempted' him . ‘It is not too far to say that he may . not have known that having sex with a 13-year-old girl was illegal.’ Judge Stokes sentenced Rashid to nine months youth custody, suspended . for two years, along with a two-year probation supervision order. Describing Rashid, the judge said: . ‘He’s had an unusual education, certainly in terms of the sexual . education provided. Comparing women to lollipops is a very curious way . of teaching young men about sex.’ But he said that Rashid knew what he was doing was wrong. ‘It was made clear to you at the . school you attended that having sexual relations with a woman before . marriage was contrary to the precepts of Islam,’ he said. Addressing Rashid, the judge said: ‘I . accept this was a case where the girl was quite willing to have sexual . activity with you. But the law is there to protect young girls, even . though they are perfectly happy to engage in sexual activity.’","Adil Rashid admitted travelling to Nottingham and having sex with the girl .

"In its heyday it hosted the elite and influential including royalty and Hollywood's A-list celebrities - but that all ended with the Rainbow Room's closure following the 2008 financial collapse. Now one of New York's best-known and much-loved high-society haunts is set to reopen in 2014, after nearly five years collecting dust. Commanding some of the city's best views, the restaurant, cabaret room and bar, on the 65th floor of 30 Rockefeller Plaza, central Manhattan, will once again open its doors to the rich and famous. Reopening:  The decadent Rainbow Room, much loved for its revolving dance floor, pictured in 1995, has been closed for five years but is now set to reopen in autumn 2014 . Memories: The Rainbow Room, located on the 65th floor of 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York. Closed in 2009 amid a landlord-tenant dispute . When it reopens in autumn of next year, it will be exactly 80 years after the venue's inaugural unveiling as a swanky supper club after the repeal of Prohibition, in 1934. In the early part of the century, the sky-high venue was legendary for hosting big bands on a revolving floor, in a magnificent room where guests could dine and dance the night away. Music greats including Louis Armstrong, Tony Bennett and Guy Lombardo once performed to star-packed audiences . Dressed to the nines, stars have included Princess Margaret and Lord Snowden, who were seen laughing with actress Patricia Neal best known for her roles in The Day The Earth Stood Still and Breakfast at Tiffany's.

Singer Barbara Streisand and her husband Elliot Gould were spotted at a celebration party for the cast of film  'Funny Girl' at the Rainbow Room in New York, 1968 . The swinging 1960s saw the lofty restaurant used as a party haunt for many Hollywood greats, including the cast of the film 'Funny Girl' in 1968, which included singer Barbra Streisand and her husband Elliot Gould. The venue was frequently used in the 1990s to host award ceremonies, particularly for films, and was frequented by world famous stars from across the world. In the 1980s, facing competition from other exclusive restaurants, including the Equitable Center and Battery Park City, the venue was closed for nearly two years from 1985 and underwent a $25million restoration and expansion to its 45,000 square feet.

A little more than a decade later, in 1998, the Rockefeller family passed operations of the restaurant over to the Italian Cipriani family, the founders of the renowned Harry's Bar in Venice. The European extensively remodelled the place and fired all union workers. Things were booming again up until the 2008 financial crash; the price of a New Year;s Eve ticket in 2007 was $160,000 per person, which included Champagne, caviar, truffles, cocktails and access to the venue throughout the night and for breakfast the next day. In October 2008, the city granted it landmark status saying its art deco-style decor 'came to epitomize New York City'.

"A Libyan navy ship docked at Benghazi port was hit during heavy fighting today between the army and Islamist fighters in Libya's second-largest city, residents said. Smoke was seen rising from the port area, to which the army had earlier moved heavy guns to attack positions of Islamist fighters. A security source said the ship was sinking but this could not immediately be confirmed. Heavy fighting broke out near the seaport of the city today as the army, backed by forces loyal to a former general, attacked Islamist groups, residents said. Street fighting: Libyan  soldiers open fire their weapons during clashes with Islamic militias in Benghazi in this October 29 photo. There are reports a Libyan navy ship docked at Benghazi port was hit during the fighting . Dozens of residents were leaving the city, heeding a call by the army to evacuate the port area where military officials say Islamists are holed up after more than two weeks of fighting. A Reuters reporter saw the army deploying tanks and artillery in Libya's second-largest city. Yesterday at least 210 people were killed in fighting in the city since troops loyal to the country's elected government launched an attempt to re-take the city from Islamist militias two weeks earlier, a medical official said. The official would not identify those killed, or say whether they included government troops. The turmoil in Benghazi started when renegade General Khalifa Hifter - a former Gadhafi army chief who joined the opposition decades before the uprising - launched a campaign against Islamist militias which were implicated in series of assassinations and attacks on journalists, activists, and security forces in the city. A Libyan military solider takes cover in the midst of the fighting. Military officials say Islamists are holed up after more than two weeks of fighting . The turmoil in Benghazi started when renegade General Khalifa Hifter - a former Gadhafi army chief who joined the opposition decades before the uprising - launched a campaign against Islamist militias . Hifter won support among large sectors of Libyans but the army units loosely allied with him were defeated and forced to leave the city by Islamist militias. Then, the internationally-recognised government, led by Abdullah al-Thinni, joined ranks with Hifter and on October 15, launched a wide offensive to retake the city. Until then, Hifter troops had largely fought from bases outside the city. On Sunday, a security official in Benghazi said government troops have entered a new neighborhood in the city. The official said the troops are carrying out a wave of arrests against Islamist militias and have arrested one of their spokesmen. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorised to brief reporters. Libya is witnessing one of the worst spasms of violence since the downfall of longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi. Powerful militias, who had fought to bring Gadhafi down, took control of the country, challenging the authority of central government.","Witnesses saw smoke rising from area of heavy fighting .

Outraged: Colin Powell's former chief of staff Lawrence Wilkerson said the Republican Party was 'full of racists' who want President Obama out of the White House because he's black . Backlash: Wilkerson, right, appeared on Ed Schultz's, left, MSNBC show to comment on a racially charged remark made by Mitt Romney's surrogate about his former boss' endorsement of Obama . The Huffington Post reported that when the host asked the general what, . if anything, Sununu's statement said about the attitudes of the GOP, . Wilkerson responded by saying: . 'My party, unfortunately, is the . bastion of those people -- not all of them, but most of them -- who are . still basing their positions on race. 'Let me just be candid: My Party is . full of racists, and the real reason a considerable portion of my party . wants President Obama out of the White house has nothing to do with the . content of his character, nothing to do with his competence as . commander-in-chief and president, and everything do with the color of . his skin, and that's despicable.' Wilkerson's harsh condemnation of the . GOP comes after Sununu said he did not believe General Powell switched . parties and endorsed Barack Obama because he likes his policies. He . said: ‘Frankly, when you take a look at Colin Powell, you have to . wonder whether that’s an endorsement based on issues or whether he’s got . a slightly different reason for preferring President Obama.’ Wilkerson also added that 'to say . that Colin Powell would endorse President Obama because of his skin . color is like saying Mother Theresa worked for profit.' The president himself dismissed Sununu's racially charged comment on Friday while appearing on Michael Smerconish's radio show. Support: Colin Powell (left) voted for Barack Obama (right) in 2008, and has announced he will do so again this year. The race for the White House has polarised voters along racial lines . Claim: John Sunumu has suggested that Colin Powell endorsed Barack Obama's presidential campaign because they are both black . 'Any suggestion that general Powell . would make such a profound statement in such an important election based . on anything but what he thought was what's going to be best for America . doesn't make much sense,’ Obama said. Asked to explain what he meant by Piers Morgan on CNN, he said: 'Well, I think when you have somebody of your own race that you’re proud of being president of the United States, I applaud Colin for standing with him.' Mr Sununu, a former governor of New Hampshire and  White House Chief of Staff under President George H. W. Bush, later backed away from his racially-charged comment on Thursday night. But it immediately sparked outrage among Democrats just hours before a new poll showed a growing black-white divide in America’s viciously polarized politics. The mixed-race Mr Obama successfully sold himself in  2008 as a 'post-racial' president who would bridge America’s historic black-white divide. But a tracking poll for the Washington Post shows the president is struggling to connect with many of the white voters who supported him four years ago. Revelation: Mr Powell, a former general, made his endorsement during an interview on CBS This Morning . While Mr Obama is still supported by the vast majority – some 80 per cent - of black and Hispanic voters, his share of whites has fallen from 43 percent in 2008 to 37 percent this year. This puts him 23 points behind Mr Romney among white voters. The survey shows that Mr Obama’s dwindling popularity since he was trounced by Mitt Romney in their first TV debate has been particularly severe among white voters in three categories - men, people without university degrees and those who describe themselves as politically uncommitted. That last section is particularly important as both sides are aware that it is America’s relatively small number of swing voters who are likely to decide the election. Attack: John McCain has criticised Mr Powell for giving his support to the Obama campaign . The survey provided additional good . news for Mr Romney, seeing him pull ahead of Mr Obama overall by 50 . percent of the national vote to 47 percent. Despite the exodus of white voters from the Democrats, the tracking poll showed that they still distrust Mr Romney. Forty eight percent of white voters said . a Romney presidency would do more to help the rich while most of them . believe Mr Obama will do more to assist the middle class. Mr Sununu's comments followed an attack on Mr Powell by former presidential candidate John McCain who said he has . 'harmed his legacy' by turning away from the Republican Party. Worry: Mr Obama's support among white voters is flagging, according to a new poll . Change: Mr Powell has criticised Mitt Romney's shifting position on many foreign policy issues . A poll by Time magazine also showed . Mr Obama doing badly among white voters in Ohio, widely seen as the . state that Mr Romney must win if he is to have a chance of taking the . White House. According to the survey, the . president is trailing the Republican by six per cent among whites in the . state even though Mr Obama rescued a US car industry that is one of . Ohio’s main sources of jobs. Compounding alarm for the Democrats, . there is growing concern that many African-Americans have lost . enthusiasm for the once-inspirational president and may not turn out on . polling day. Mr Powell served in the Vietnam War before entering public life as President Reagan's National Security Advisor. He oversaw the conduct of the Gulf War as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and was Secretary of State during the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq.

"Rob Fielding, 43, from Aylesbury, was reading in bed when a moth flew into his ear - and stayed there . A father-of-three who felt a moth fly into his ear as he lay reading in bed had it buzzing around inside his head for three days. Eventually Rob Fielding, 43, a marketing manager from Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, sought medical help - and ended up needing a 90-minute operation to remove the insect from his ear canal. He said: 'It was awful knowing the moth was flying around inside my head.  Every now and then, when I felt it move, it made me jump out of my skin.' Mr Fielding was lying in bed on 8 August when he felt the insect land on his glasses and then buzzed into his ear.  He reached up to brush it away, but accidentally pushed it into his ear canal instead. He hoped it would fly out but then endured three days of the insect buzzing in his head, making him twitch every time it moved. Finally his wife Joanne, 41, sent him to Stoke Mandeville hospital in Aylesbury for help. Mr Fielding said: 'The nurses were all very shocked when I told them what had happened. 'One of them used a light to look into my ear and all they could see was a leg wiggling around.' Mr Fielding was referred on to an ear, nose and throat specialist in Oxford, and told he needed a ten-minute procedure to remove the insect. But the operation ended up taking an hour and a half as his ear canal was prised open and the moth pulled out with a tiny pair of forceps. Mr Fielding said: 'It was my cousin's wedding and my whole family were going to be there but we had to miss it because of the moth.  I was devastated.' The surgeon had to delve two centimetres into his inner ear to reach the moth. The father of Fred, eight, Betsy, six, and Meg, four, said: 'After shoving a funnel into my ear they managed to widen the passage and get the moth out with a tiny pair of forceps. 'It was incredibly painful as it was next to my ear drum.  It felt as if I'd just come off an aeroplane and my ears had just popped.' The dead insect is now displayed on the Fieldings' mantelpiece as a souvenir of the unlikely episode. 'The kids find it absolutely hilarious and are obsessed with showing everyone our new pet,' Mr Fielding said.

"Claim: Denise Lindsay has gone to the court to find out if the word 'golliwog' is 'inherently discriminatory' A black chef claims that her white boss racially harassed her when he mentioned the word ‘golliwog’ during a conversation about the famous Robertson’s jam labels. Lawyers for Denise Lindsay, 45, claim that the word is ‘inherently discriminatory’ and has ‘racial overtones’ and should not have been used in front of their client. But her boss Mark McAleese claims that he was talking about the jam label changing and has apologised to her and said that he had no desire to ‘violate her dignity’. Her lawyers are battling to convince three top judges that the word is inherently offensive to black people and almost always discriminatory - no matter in what context it is used. Her barrister, Daniel Matovu, told the court: ‘White people don’t get called golliwogs. The word is an overtly racial comment. [The word] golliwog cannot be interpreted in any other way. ‘What the authorities make clear is that, when something is inherently discriminatory and clearly has racial overtones, there is no further debate.’ British jam manufacturers Robertson’s started using the Golly character, dressed in a yellow waistcoat and bow tie, on its jars from 1910. In the late-1920s, the company started producing popular badges featuring the character, including a golfing, cricketer and footballer version. The items became collectables. However, the cartoon disappeared from labels in 2002 after decades of controversy and jars of marmalade now feature Paddington Bear. The company has always insisted that the Golly character was withdrawn for commercial reasons rather than a reaction to the controversy surrounding the figure. Chef Denise Lindsay is suing her boss for racial harassment after he used the word 'golliwog' in a conversation about the removal of the controversial character from labels of Robertson's jam . Jars of Robertson's marmalade now feature the far less controversial Paddington Bear . Miss Lindsay was working as an assistant chef manager at the LSE’s Bloomsbury student halls in February 2009 when the comment was made by chef manager Mr McAleese. He used the word while discussing ‘the change to the label of Robertson’s jam’, the court heard. But Miss Lindsay, of Clapham, south west London, was upset and an employment tribunal later found that what Mr McAleese said amounted to ‘an isolated act of harassment’. He apologised and said that he had not uttered the word for the ‘purpose of violating her dignity’. The tribunal ruled: ‘We have concluded that, for a white manager to use the words “golliwog” and “golliwog jam” in the course of a conversation with a black Afro-Caribbean colleague is unwanted conduct.’ However, Miss Lindsay’s harassment claim was dismissed after the tribunal said it had been brought too late. Denise Lindsay's complaint relates to her time working at a London School Of Economics hall of residence in Bloomsbury . Whether that decision was justified is one of the central issues now being considered by the Appeal Court judges. Miss Lindsay’s other complaints of race discrimination were dismissed by the tribunal and, although she still has an active victimisation claim, she is asking the court to reconsider the issue. Her barrister Mr Matovu argued that the tribunal was plainly wrong to dismiss the golliwog complaint purely on grounds of delay. However, the LSE’s barrister, Shaen  Catherwood, insisted that Mr McAleese’s use of the controverisal word - spoken quietly and quickly - did not come anywhere close to racial harassment. ‘I say it is unsatisfactory that somebody should be labelled with a finding of harassment on racial grounds when the actual context in which the word was used was innocent and inoffensive,’ he told the court. Lord Justice Moore-Bick, Lord Justice Floyd and Lord Justice Christopher Clarke reserved their decision on the case until a later date.","Denise Lindsay worked at university hall of residence in London .

"The former playboy son of Muammar Gaddafi has been broadcast on Libya's state television in prison uniform apologising and begging for the nation's forgiveness. Al-Saadi Gaddafi was extradited to Libya and locked up in Tripoli earlier this month from Niger, where he had taken refuge after his father's regime crumbled in 2011. Prison authorities say the video is in response to ‘rumours’ that al-Saadi Gaddafi is being tortured in custody. Scroll down for video . Libyan state TV has aired footage showing al-Saadi Gaddafi (pictured left in 2005 and right from a prison in Tripoli), one of late dictator Muammar Gaddafi's sons, jailed in Libya apologising to the nation . These photographs show al-Saadi Gaddafi having his head shaven after he was extradited from Niger to Libya . The Libyan government is preparing to prosecute him for his alleged role in trying to suppress the uprising against Gaddafi's rule. In the video, al-Saadi is wearing blue prison uniform, sitting in what looks like an office. He says he is sorry for the ‘harm and disturbances’ - without elaborating - and adds he is being treated well in prison. Earlier this month al-Saadi . became the second son of the ousted and slain leader to be held in . custody in Libya. His brother Seif al-Islam was captured in 2011 and has . been held in a western mountain prison by a militia that is putting him . on trial, refusing to hand him over to the central government for . trial. At the time of the . revolt that brought down his father, al-Saadi headed a brigade of . special forces that was involved in the crackdown against protesters and . rebels. But he is perhaps even more notorious among Libyans for his career in football, the country's most popular sport.

"It wasn’t quite one of the gruelling 75-minute work-outs Robin van Persie has warned his Manchester United team-mates about, but Louis van Gaal was still his usual uncompromising self as Holland trained on Friday. Van Persie frightened a few in the Old Trafford dressing room this week when he described how Van Gaal would be on their backs every minute during ‘enormously intense’ training sessions. But on the evidence of the final Dutch practice before Saturday night's World Cup warm-up with Ghana, it will be some of his more unorthodox techniques that will unsettle them. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Louis van Gaal's quirky training methods . Snap happy: Louis van Gaal pretends to take a picture of some of his players in Holland training . Preparation: The Netherlands team trained at De Kuip in Rotterdam on Friday . In charge: The incoming Manchester United boss marshals his Dutch players . There was an entertaining game of head . tennis in which three groups of seven - holding hands in a circle - . must race from byline to half-way line without allowing the ball to . drop. Unfortunately, the . circle nearest to Van Gaal weren’t especially good and every time the . ball hit the ground, he would despatch them unceremoniously back to the . start with an outstretched finger and a look of disdain. During . a 40-minute small-sided game, it was imperative that Van Gaal’s team - . containing former Liverpool striker Dirk Kuyt, now at Fenerbahce, and . Newcastle United goalkeeper Tim Krul - won. A . whistle permanently resting between his lips, he pointed, prodded and . posed searching questions until they finally got their act together and . scored the decisive goals. At . one point, Feyenoord centre back Terence Kongolo turned away from his . manager, wincing with pain, and poured cold water down his shorts. The . agony wasn’t inflicted by Van Gaal - not on this occasion - but the . must-win mentality clearly stretches down to even the smallest of games. When . not snapping and snarling, Van Gaal stood aloof in one of two default . stances. The one with the arms folded and the one with the hands plunged . deep in his pockets. Something wrong? Terence Kongolo (right) looks in discomfort as he turns away . Both, . allied with a stern and unchanging expression, leave it clear that this . is a meticulous coach who sees everything and demands the highest . standards. There was . delegation for the warm-ups, to assistants Patrick Kluivert and Danny . Blind, but once Van Gaal strode up, there was no doubting who was in . charge. There was some fun, . too, but only at the very end. When Kuyt and Co finally emerged . victors, Van Gaal lined them up in celebratory pose and pretended to . take a picture of them. It . was probably more of a show for the 5,000-strong crowd - the vast . majority kitted out in oranje, naturally - who had gathered at the De . Kuip for a public training session. Van . Gaal was cheered to the echo whenever he kicked a ball and the . consensus was that he’s perhaps leaving for England too soon. But that opinion may change if Holland fail to advance beyond a tricky World Cup group containing Spain, Chile and Australia. Crowd: Holland supporters packed in to Feyenoord's home stadium De Kuip to watch the training session . United front: Robin van Persie and Van Gaal have a word during training in Rotterdam . Their . form hasn’t been great since completing qualification unbeaten with a . 2-0 win over Turkey back in October, the subsequent friendlies . comprising of draws with Japan, Colombia and Ecuador, and a defeat to . France. Van Gaal will cut . his 29-man provisional squad - reduced after Rafael van der Vaart pulled . out with a calf injury -  to 23 on Monday, so the Ghana match is a last . chance to impress. He will . reshuffle his team, with Van Persie leading a three-pronged attack . alongside Wesley Sneijder and Arjen Robben, and Swansea’s Jonathan De . Guzman in midfield. Van . Gaal has been here before and not prospered. He was in charge when . Ireland beat them to qualification for the 2002 finals and Kuyt believes . that failure is his primary motivation.

"Clemson University students can breathe a little bit easier today knowing they are no longer required to reveal intimate details of their sex life to members of the school's administration. The university, in Clemson, South Carolina,  had sent out a survey as part of a mandatory, one-hour long Title IX training course that was to be completed by students, faculty, and staff, and asked how many sexual partners an individual had been with over the past three months. Making matters worse, everyone who took the survey was required to sign in using their full name, email address and student ID. Uproar: Many at Clemson University (above) objected to a mandatory survey that required students to reveal how many sexual partners they had been with . After much uproar among members of the student body, Clemson has now decided to suspend the program. 'It’s not that I have an issue with being trained on Title IX,' one Clemson student told Campus Reform. 'I have an issue with the personal questions that are asked, and the fact that I’m told it’s anonymous, but it’s clearly linked to my name, and it’s obviously through a third party so not only is my information that I’m going to be filling out—incredibly personal information regarding my sex life that I have issues with speaking about—it’s not only going to the university, it’s going to a third party company that I don’t know.' That third party is CampusClarity, a creator of online training programs dealing with sexual assault and substance abuse prevention. No privacy: The mandatory survey, which also asked how many times an individual had had sex over the past three months, required everyone to sign in using their full name, which many felt was a violation of privacy . In addition to asking the number of sexual partners a person had been with, the survey also asked how many times an individual had sex over the past three months and how often they drank and did drugs. 'Does the university need to know if I had oral or normal sex in the last three months after I’ve been drinking alcohol or using drugs recreationally or if I used a condom during?' asked senior Roger Clinkscales. The university announced its plan to suspend the survey in an email sent last night. 'Required Title IX online training has been suspended pending elimination of certain questions that were associated with a training module provided by a third-party vendor,' it read. 'Clemson University will eliminate these questions. We apologize for any concern and inconvenience this has caused.'

"NBC has pulled the plug on its planned comedy project with Bill Cosby following claims by multiple women that he drugged and raped them. 'We can confirm that the Cosby project is no longer in development,' the network said in a statement released on Wednesday afternoon. The announcement came just hours after Netflix said it has postponed its new stand-up comedy special, Bill Cosby 77, which was due to air the day after Thanksgiving. Appearances by Cosby on shows including Late Night With David Letterman and The Queen Latifah Show have also been cancelled as accusations against the comedian mount. Scroll down for video... Accused: Bill Cosby, pictured in September, has been accused of rape by multiple women - leading NBC to cancel a proposed comedy series starring the actor . On Wednesday, sources told Variety that writers and producers working on NBC's still-untitled comedy project with the star were told on Wednesday that it is no longer going forward. The network had set a deal for the show with Cosby last summer and it was set to star him in another family setting, similar to his role in The Cosby Show. Sony Pictures TV was going to develop the script with writers Mike O'Malley and Mike Sikowitz, although a finished script was never handed over to NBC, according to Variety. The cancellation came after yet more women stepped forward to claim he had sexually assaulted them, often after providing them with alcohol. Removed: TV Land has decided ""The Cosby Show"" isn't worth the risk, so it's quietly killing the show's presence on it's website . Now the cable network TV Land has also decided any association with the funnyman isn't worth the risk. The company is quietly killing his show's presence on it's website. On Wednesday deactivated all of the ""Cosby"" links. Previously, users were able to watch video clips of his show and get information about air dates. Those same links now direct users to an error page. Meanwhile, his comedy concert series appears to still be going ahead. TMZ  is reporting that staff at the Atlantis Resort in the Bahamas had a meeting on Wednesday to decide whether or not to pull Thursday's show, which is almost sold out. He is also due to perform in Melbourne, Florida on Friday to another packed house. Again, the show is on and nobody has asked for a refund. Next Friday he is scheduled to perform in Las Vegas. There are still seats available and the show has not been cancelled and it is likely to remain that way until any formal charges are filed. Chilling: Former model Janice Dickinson claimed in an interview on Tuesday evening, pictured, how he drugged her with a pill and wine and raped her in 1982. The next day she was in a lot of pain, she said . ANDREA CONSTAND . In 2005 the former director of operations for the women's basketball team at Temple University went to authorities to reveal she was sexually molested by Cosby. Without enough evidence to indict him, Constand launched a civil suit but settled out of court. At the time, 13 other women said they would testify about assaults they had suffered at the hands of Cosby but due to the settlement, they did not appear in court. BARBARA BOWMAN . In October she told MailOnline that in the mid-1980's, when she was an aspiring actress living in Colorado, she was introduced to the comic who would help launch her career. She says she was 'drugged, raped an emotionally abused' by the man who had become a father figure to her. JOAN TARSHIS . On two occasions in Hollywood in 1969 the music publicist says Cosby gave her 'strong drinks that caused her to black out and when she awoke she was naked and he then attacked her'. LINDA JOY TRAITZ . Traitz of Hallandale Beach, Florida, claims she was just 19 when the actor drove her out to a beach in Los Angeles and tried to get her to relax by taking drugs . JANICE DICKINSON . Last night supermodel Janice Dickinson told Entertainment Tonight that Bill Cosby lured her to his home with a TV offer and then drugged and raped her in 1982. 'The last thing I remember is him taking off his robe and climbing on top of me': . TAMARA GREEN . Green told MailOnline that she was an aspiring actress in the 1970s when Cosby gave her pills and pretended to care for her while she had the flu, but instead sexually assaulted her. On Entertainment Tonight on Tuesday, former model Janice Dickinson, now 59, said that Cosby sexually assaulted her in 1982. Dickinson said it happened after a dinner they shared in Lake Tahoe, Nevada, where she said she had gone to talk about a job offer from Cosby. At the dinner she said she had red wine and a pill Cosby gave her because she had menstrual and stomach pains. 'The next morning I woke up, and I wasn't wearing my pajamas, and I remember before I passed out that I had been sexually assaulted by this man,' Dickinson told ET. She said she woke up with semen between her legs. She added that she is coming forward now though because she believes the other victims who have spoken publicly, and that it is the 'right thing to do'. As for what she would say to Cosby if she saw him, Dickinson does not mince words. 'How dare you,' she said. 'Go f*** yourself. How dare you take advantage of me. And I hope you rot.' It came after former actress Barbara Bowman revealed her alleged abuse to MailOnline, explaining that in 1985, at age 17, Cosby 'brainwashed me into viewing him as a father figure, and then assaulted me multiple times'. Then on Sunday, Joan Tarshis, a former publicist, said she was working as a writer for Cosby in 1969, when Cosby drugged and sexually abused her on two occasions. Linda Joy Traitz then stepped forward to claim Cosby attacked her when she was 19. Then on Wednesday, another woman, retired lawyer Tamara Green, claimed Cosby gave her pills and pretended to care for her while she had the flu, but instead sexually assaulted her in the 1970s. She was an aspiring actress at the time and Cosby promised to help her secure roles. Cosby has denied the allegations. He has never been criminally charged in any case, but in November 2006, Cosby settled a civil lawsuit with Andrea Constand, a former Temple University employee who claimed he had drugged and sexually assaulted her in his Philadelphia-area mansion two years earlier.

Following the accusations, on Tuesday, Netflix said it would not be airing its show as planned. 'At this time we are postponing the launch of the new stand-up comedy special Bill Cosby 77,' the video streaming service said in a statement.

"The 23-year-old Maryland man who climbed over the White House fence Wednesday night has been charged with felonies for assaulting two police dogs and making threats, the Secret Service said Thursday. Dominic Adesanya of Bel Air, Maryland, is in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service for previous outstanding warrants, Secret Service spokesman Brian Leary said. Adesanya has also been charged with four misdemeanor counts of resisting arrest and unlawful entry. The Los Angeles Times reports that Adesanya had tried to access the White House before when he jumped a security barrier on July 27. Jumper: Dominic Adesanya of Bel Air, Maryland jumped the White House fence Wednesday and was quickly appended by Secret Service officers . The 23-year-old has since been charged with assault, resisting arrest, and unlawful entry . An agent said Adesanya told him it 'was easy and that the next fence to the south grounds of the White House would not be a problem as well.' He was released two days later after a mental evaluation found him 'incompetent' to stand for trial, but the next day, he was again taken into custody as he tried to enter the Treasury Department. He got into a scuffle with three police officers before being detained. He was released, but missed a trial scheduled for September 9, and a warrant was issued for his arrest. On Wednesday, video showed the moment Adesanya jumped the White House fence just after 7:15pm and stood on the North Lawn, gesturing and lifting his shirt, until he was taken down by K-9 units and the Secret Service. On the lawn, Adesanya kicked a Secret Service K-9 unit that ran at him before another dog wrestled him to the ground and he was taken into custody. Agent John Grimsley, in an affidavit filed Thursday, said that Adesanya told him he 'was going to keep coming back until he saw President Obama.' 'Dogs got him,' a spokesperson for the Secret Service told Reuters after the incident. The White House was put on lockdown for a little over an hour but was not evacuated. The Secret Services dogs, named Hurricane and Jordan, were taken to a veterinarian after the incident to be treated for minor bruising. Both have since been cleared to return to work. Adesanya's last post to Instagram on Tuesday showed an I Voted sticker captioned 'Voted for this B #ImpeachObama.' Other photos show him in action for Stevenson University in track and field, or showing off his physique in shirtless selfies. Speaking with ABC 2, Adesanya's father said his son had been arrested at the White House before and that he wanted to speak to the president about how people were out to get him. He also seemed to have an obsession with the Rothschild family, in particular Nathaniel Philip Rothschild, the British-born Swiss financier. On a LinkedIn page with zero connections, in place of a job title, he describes himself as an 'American Slave' and rants about the Rothschild banking family. Heroes: The two dogs, Hurricane and Jordan, were taken to the vet after suffering bruises but quickly returned to their security detail . Lockdown: The grounds of the White House were placed on lockdown after the jumper scaled the fence and ran onto the lawn . 'Still waiting for Nathaniel Philip Rothschild and his father; Nathaniel Charles Jacob Rothschild-4th Baron Rothschild to let me go,' his profile states. After his previous arrest, Adesanya claimed the banking family that he said 'owned the Federal Reserve Bank' was targeting him, and he said he wanted cameras that had been placed in his home removed, according to a court document. At the time, he was ordered to get outpatient mental health screening and return to court September 9. Adesanya was reported to be unarmed at the time of his arrest and was taken to the hospital. The incident comes a time when tensions and security concerns are high. Earlier Wednesday, a Canadian soldier was gunned down at the National War Memorial in Ottawa before gunman Michael Zehaf-Bibeauinto was shot and killed by the sergeant at arms. Jumper: Adesanya showed off his physique on Instagram and was a track runner for Stevenson, though according to his father he does not attend the school at this time . Struggle: The White House fence jumper kicked a service dog that ran at him and then struggled with another on the lawn before being brought down (brightened to show detail) Subdued: The man punched a USSS K-9 unit as it tried to knock him to the ground and was transported to the hospital, though it was not clear what the injuries were (brightened to show detail) Adesanya is the seventh person who has made it over the fence this year. The incident came about a month after a previous White House fence jumper carrying a knife sprinted across the same lawn, ran past armed uniformed agents and entered the mansion before he was felled in the ceremonial East Room and taken into custody. That embarrassing September 19 incident preceded the disclosure of other serious Secret Service breaches in security for Obama and ultimately led to Julia Pierson's resignation as director of the agency after 18 months on the job. After Pierson resigned, an agent who once led Obama's protective detail came out of retirement to lead the Secret Service until Obama names a new director, pending the completion of internal and independent reviews of agency practices. This week, a federal judge delayed the arraignment of Omar Gonzalez, the man charged in September's fence-jumping incident, because of questions about his mental fitness to stand trial. Gonzalez has been indicted on several charges, including carrying a knife into the White House and assaulting two Secret Service officers.","Dominic Adesanya, 23, of Bel Air, Maryland, was taken into Secret Service custody and charged with assault, resisting arrest and unlawful entry .

"The man who jumped over the White House fence this month got further into the building than security officials let on, it has emerged. Senior sources reveal Omar Gonzalez, 42, made it all the way to the East Room of the first floor as he tore past five rings of security on September 19 wielding a knife. He allegedly ran freely across the 70-yard front lawn, through the North Portico hall past a guard, and into the East Room, which is next to the staircase leading to the family's living quarters - 168 feet into the executive mansion. Eventually, he was subdued in the Green Room by a plainclothes guard. Scroll down for video . Revealed: Omar Gonzalez is said to have made it all the way to the East Room of the White House . Route: Gonzalez allegedly made it 168 feet into the building, through the North Portico hall to the East Room . The East Room of the White House is an 80-foot-long hall used for formal events including bill signings, press conferences, receptions and ceremonies. A Secret Service official who spoke on condition of anonymity told the Washington Post an alarm box near the front entrance of the White House had been muted. 'The Secret Service has no comment on that at this time due to the ongoing investigation,' Brian Leary, a spokesman for the agency, said of the Post story. A White House spokesman declined comment. The revelations come a day after a report revealed the Secret Service was unaware for four days that a man had fired a high-powered rifle at the White House in 2011 in a 'fumbled' response that left the Obamas furious. Officers allegedly performed a string of security lapses after Oscar Ramiro Ortega-Hernandez shot at least seven bullets at the executive mansion in Washington from his car. At the time, President Barack Obama, his wife Michelle and their older daughter Malia were not at home, but their younger daughter Sasha and Mrs Obama's mother, Marian Robinson, were inside. East Room: The 80-foot-long hall is used for formal occasions such as the signing of bills and receptions . Dash: A video of the incident shows Gonzalez running towards the White House after getting past plainclothes security guards outside the fence. SWAT teams and an attack dog failed to stop him on the lawn . Security breach: Senior sources said he made it past five rings of security before he was subdued by a sixth . Tomorrow, Secret Service director Julia Pierson will be forced to respond to both incidents at a hearing with the Government Reform Committee. Gonzalez, a homeless Iraq veteran, was charged with unlawfully entering a restricted building or grounds while carrying a deadly or dangerous weapon. Security officials say he did not express any wish to harm the president instead claiming he just wanted to tell him that the 'atmosphere was collapsing'. Still, his successful attempt on the White House raises serious security questions. He is the first person believed to have jumped the fence and made it into the building. A prosecutor said in court last week that officers found more than 800 rounds of ammunition, two hatchets and a machete in Gonzalez's car. Troubled: In an undated photograph, Gonzalez poses with his former wife Samantha before an overseas deployment. She explained she split up with him due to his deteriorating mental state . Serving his country: Gonzalez, pictured with then-sister-in-law Nancy Hoover and her husband, served three tours in Iraq before suffering injuries in an IED blast. He has been homeless for the last three months . Gonzalez, who completed three tours of Iraq, had been arrested in July with a sniper rifle and a map on which the executive mansion was marked, the prosecutor said. The alarm box near the entrance, designed to alert guards to an intruder, had been muted at what officers believe was the request of the usher's office, the Post said, citing the Secret Service official. The officer posted inside the door appeared to be delayed in learning the intruder was about to come through, the Post said. Officers are trained to lock the front door immediately if they learn of an intruder on the grounds.","Omar Gonzalez 'scaled the fence outside the White House, dashed across the lawn and entered the executive mansion with a knife on September 19'

"Like any professional secret service agent, Jordan seems to have bounced straight back after sustaining some injuries on the job. The brave Belgian Malnois was one of two K-9's that took down White House intruder Dominic Adesanya, 23, who scaled the north fence and sprinted across the lawn on Wednesday night in a bid to reach the executive mansion, where President Obama and the first family were at the time. Jordan and fellow dog Hurricane, who can both sprint 25 miles per hour and have a bite that applies hundreds of pounds of pressure per square inch, quickly took down the Maryland man, who suffers from mental problems and was arrested two months earlier for another White House security breach. Adesanya tried to fight off the police dogs, kicking Jordan in the snout and slamming Hurricane to the ground before punching him repeatedly. Scroll down for video .

Rest: The Belgian Malnois chills out on the lawn outside the White Fence on Friday . Job well done: Jordan, left, and Hurricane, right, have returned to work after stopping a White House intruder on Wednesday. The dogs were treated for minor bruises after the intruder kicked and punched them . They were treated for minor bruises, but have now headed back to work, the Secret Service said. On Friday, a dog believed to be Hurricane was seen back on the job outside the White House. The K-9 eagerly answered orders from a minder and appeared to be injury-free. On Thursday, White House press secretary Josh Earnest praised the agents' response, saying, 'Yesterday's incident underscores the professionalism of the Secret Service.' As the agency shared photos of the dogs on Twitter, it revealed that Jordan, a five-year-old black and tan Belgian Malinois, 'enjoys walks around White House'. Stopped: Dominic Adesanya, who has a history of mental illness, remains in police custody . Hurricane, a six-year-old black Belgian Malinois, 'enjoys playing with his Kong toy', the Twitter feed said. The agency noted both are 'ready to work'. Adesanya, from Bel Air, Maryland, is in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service and has been charged with felony assault on a police officer for hurting the dogs. He is being held without bond. He was unarmed when he tried to reach the White House. After his arrest, his father revealed that Adesanya had the paranoid belief he was being watched by cameras and had previously been arrested at the executive mansion. He was arrested on July 27 and ordered to undergo mental health screening. Court records show he told an officer that he wanted cameras that had been placed in his home removed. The document also says he told an officer that the security barrier he jumped over 'was easy and that the next fence to the south grounds of the White House would not be a problem as well.' After the arrest he was ordered to get outpatient mental health screening . He was apprehended again on July 30 after he refused to leave the Treasury building,  next to the White House, and swung his fists at officers. Cruel: Video footage captured Adesanya kicking one of the dogs and punching another on the lawn . Dogs have been working for the Secret Service since 1975. The agency trains Belgian Malinois, like Hurricane and Jordan. While the breed is known for its gentle nature, the dogs can also run 30 miles and have a 270-degree field of vision, making them effective at hunting down targets. They resemble small German shepherds and their short hair allows them to work well in the heat. One was used in the team that cornered Osama bin Laden in 2011. Secret Service dogs must complete 20 weeks of training with handlers before they can report for duty. They complete eight hours a week of refresher training once they're on the job. On average, they work until they are about 10. This means that Hurricane, who's six, and Jordan, who's five, have a few more years of work left in them yet. He was supposed to return to court  but didn't show up and warrants for his arrest were issued. His father, Victor Adesanya, said in a telephone interview that his son has been experiencing mental health problems for over a year, but he refused the help the family tried to get for him. Victor Adesanya said his son was diagnosed with paranoia and schizophrenia and 'complained about cameras everywhere.' He said at one point his son took down a mirror in the bathroom and cut into the wall, trying to find a camera. He also looked for them in the family's attic. He said his son was not trying to hurt the president. 'He's not violent. He's not a criminal. He's not a murderer. He's just someone that's just mentally disturbed,' he said. The incident came about a month after a previous White House fence jumper, Omar Gonzalez, sprinted across the same lawn carrying a knife, ran past armed uniformed agents and entered the mansion before being felled in the ceremonial East Room and taken into custody. This week a federal judge delayed his arraignment because of questions about his mental fitness. Friends and family said the veteran was suffering from PTSD due to service abroad. Security: A member of the U.S. Secret Service stands guard in front of the North Lawn of the White House in Washington on Thursday, a day after Adesanya jumped over the fence and tried to reach the mansion . The embarrassing  incident preceded the disclosure of other serious Secret Service breaches in security for Obama and ultimately led to Julia Pierson's resignation as director of the agency after 18 months on the job. Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, who has been leading congressional investigations into the Secret Service, commended the swift response Wednesday night. But he said more needed to be known about Dominic Adesanya, including whether he was doing anything suspicious immediately before the incident that should have led to his detection. Chaffetz also suggested changes might be needed to 'maximize the pain of going over the fence.' 'It seems a little too easy to get over,' he said.","Secret Service dogs Hurricane and Jordan stopped Dominic Adesanya, 23, from reaching the executive mansion after he hopped over the fence on Wednesday night .

Omar J. Gonzalez, 42, appeared in federal court on Monday to face charges of unlawfully entering restricted grounds while carrying a weapon. He could get 10 years in prison if convicted. As he appeared in court, Virginia authorities also revealed he had been arrested last July and charged with possession of a sawed-off shot gun and eluding police. During the proceedings on  Assistant U.S. Attorney David Mudd said Gonzalez, who has been homeless for three months following a decade in the army, was a danger to the president. But relatives have insisted that Gonzalez, from Copperas Cove, Texas, suffers from post traumatic stress disorder after serving three tours in Iraq. He retired after losing part of his foot in an IED blast. A Security Service Uniformed Division patrol car is seen in front of the White House .

A member of the Security Service Uniformed Division keeps watch from Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House. A homeless US army veteran  jumped a fence on September 19 and ran into the White House with a knife. The man had more than 800 rounds of ammunition in his car . Jerry Murphy, whose mother was married to Gonzalez, said relatives always knew Gonzalez owned a small arsenal of weapons but said they doubted he intended to hurt Obama. 'I know he's got heavy artillery, you know? He's got all kinds of weapons and he was trained to use them,' Murphy said. 'I believe if he wanted to make a scene or cause problems, he very well could have. But it's clear that he didn't.' Gonzalez was arrested Friday inside the Presidential residence with a knife in his pants after making it over the fence and running across the lawn, the Secret Service said. According to agents who arrested him, Gonzalez said that he was desperate to see the President to warn him about 'the atmosphere collapsing'. President Obama and his daughters had left for Camp David via helicopter just minutes before Gonzalez allegedly rushed the northern entrance. According to a criminal complaint obtained  authorities found 'several assault rifles' in a vehicle when he was arrested after speeding and eluding state police in Virginia in July. After nearly crashing, Gonzalez was eventually pulled over. Virginia State Police said that he had a map of D.C. with a circle drawn around the White House when he was arrested. They also allegedly found 11 different weapons in his car. Then on August 25, he was stopped while walking along the fence of the White House. In that incident, authorities found he had a hatchet in his waist band. He allowed cops to search his car, but they found no further weapons or ammo and he was not arrested. The Army said Gonzalez enlisted in July 1997 and was assigned to the 10th Cavalry Regiment, 2nd Brigade, 4th Infantry Division, at Fort Hood, Texas. At the time, he listed his home as Puerto Rico. Heightened security: Uniformed Secret Service officers walk along the fence on the North side of the White House in Washington after the intruder scaled the fence, jumped over and ran towards the mansion . He was discharged in September 2003 after completing his service obligation. Gonzalez enlisted a second time, in July 2005, and served until his retirement in late 2012. Gonzalez served in Iraq from October 2006 to January 2008. Samantha Bell, Gonzalez's ex-wife, said that after his second tour in Iraq, Gonzalez began carrying a .45 on his hip at all times. He would also kept three or four rifles and shotguns behind the doors in their home, said Bell, who remarried and now lives in southern Indiana. She claims she split up with him in 2010 because of his worsening mental condition . Bell described how Gonzalez kept the blinds drawn and would repeatedly go downstairs during the night to make sure the doors were locked and the oven was off. She said she once woke up in the middle of the night to find Gonzalez standing at the foot of the bed and staring at her. She said he told her he was simply watching her sleep. 'It was really odd and I didn't know how to take that,' she said. 'I just couldn't deal with it. I didn't want to deal with it, I couldn't — that's the whole reason I left. He was so paranoid he was starting to make me paranoid. 'Omar is a good guy, he's just got some issues that he needs help with. I think this is a cry out for help, what he's done. He really does need help. I just hope he can get it.' Second arrest: Kevin Carr, 19, was taken in by officers on Saturday after allegedly driving a car up to a screening point outside the White House and then refusing to leave when he was asked . In the wake of his attempt on the White House, the Secret Service announced new, tougher security. The agency was criticized for not apprehending Gonzalez sooner, and admitted their performance was 'not acceptable,' leading to new measures being put in place. In a statement, Secret Service officials said: 'The challenge of securing the White House complex from security threats is ever present. 'Although last night the officers showed tremendous restraint and discipline in dealing with this subject, the location of Gonzalez's arrest is not acceptable. 'In addition to the criminal investigation of Gonzalez by the Secret Service's Washington Field Office, Director Julia Pierson immediately ordered the Secret Service's Office of Professional Responsibility to conduct a comprehensive after action review of the incident.' The statement continued: 'In the interim, Director Pierson has ordered the immediate enhancement of officer patrols and surveillance capabilities along the Pennsylvania Avenue fence line around the White House complex. These measures went into effect last night.' In court: Gonzalez appeared at a federal court proceeding at this courthouse in Washington D.C. on Monday . President Obama has backed the agency. A White House spokesman said: 'The president has full confidence in the Secret Service and is grateful to the men and women who day in and day out protect himself, his family and the White House.' However, press secretary Josh Earnest stressed that providing security to The White House was a 'complicated business' because of the number of tourists that visit on a daily basis. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson also encouraged the public 'not second-guess the judgment of security officers who had only seconds to act.' He insisted in a statement issued today that the public should wait 'until all the facts are in' before passing judgement on the security services. Barriers:  The Secret Service announced that 'officer patrols and surveillance capabilities' would be enhanced in the wake of the two attempts by intruders to reach the White House . Increased security: The measures came into affect along the Pennsylvania Avenue fence line around the White House complex on Monday  night . The two-block stretch of Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House's north gates has been closed to vehicle traffic since May 1995. President Bill Clinton ordered its immediate closure in an effort to prevent a potential car- or truck-bomb attack. Even so, there have been a number of recent breaches that have caused the Secret Service and Capitol Police to step. Last September a man was arrested and accused of throwing firecrackers over the fence on the north lawn. A few weeks later a Connecticut woman sparked a police chase through downtown Washington after ramming a security checkpoint. Miriam Carey, 34, was shot and killed after the bizarre incident. Another man was apprehended on September 11 before the anniversary commemorations after he jumped the White House fence . He was charged last week in local court for unlawful entry, according to the Secret Service and is set to appear in court in October.

"A beauty stylist who caught a virus whilst pregnant has made an emotional plea to other expectant mothers to watch out for symptoms of the disease. Simone Richardson, 25, lost her daughter Coco when she was just two-days-old after contracting 'slapped cheek syndrome.' The infection, caused by parvovirus B19, gets its nickname because sufferers have a rash or reddening to the face. Our daughter: Simone with her partner Oliver Espley and a picture of Coco, who died after Simone contracted 'slapped-cheek syndrome' Ms Richardson has now released pictures of her badly swollen child battling for life in hospital to make other women more aware of the condition. The mother from Rhyl, North Wales,  developed the symptoms of the virus at . 20 weeks. She was initially told by her midwife she was having a 'rough . pregnancy.' She said: 'I kept throwing up and my skin would . go really red. In the middle of the night I would be hanging my head out . of the window because I was so hot and couldn’t catch my breath and I . would feel really dizzy. 'I had a sharp pain in my tummy and I . had not been measured on my stomach and people were saying that I was . massive and looked ready to drop. The following week my legs blew up.' She was later referred to Liverpool Women’s Hospital when she . said her unborn baby was not moving. 'I was given two blood transfusions in . my womb and sent home after five days but then within two days my waters . broke when I got up in the morning,' the mother said. Comforting: Coco with parents Simone and Oliver. Sadly the baby girl died at just two-days-old. Her parents switched off life-support after they were told she had a one per cent chance of survival . This family collect of Coco in her incubator shows how the virus caused her to swell up . Coco was born prematurely at 28 weeks by emergency C-section and taken straight to the Special Care Baby Unit. Simone said: 'I could tell Oli was . terrified. I could see it in his face. I remember lying there completely . out of it and he was shouting at me to stay awake. Simone pregnant with Coco before she discovered she had contracted the Parvovirus . 'It wasn’t just the baby that he may . have lost - it was me too. I didn’t get to see her at all because they . were stitching me up. 'She went to the special care and after that they told me that it was the Parvovirus. 'When I finally got to see Coco she was . like a baby Budda - she had no neck and she was so swollen from the . fluid. They had put her in an incubator which helped to deflate the . water from her.' The couple decided to get her christened . when she was one day old, but the next day the couple were advised to . turn off her life support machine. Today Simone who lives with partner Oliver Espley, 30, a hairdresser said: 'Oli and I were devastated. We just . wanted her to be healthy and happy but she looked like she was suffering . so badly, and that’s the most awful thing for a mum to see in their . child. 'Doctors said that she only had a one per cent chance of survival. It was just the machines that were keeping her alive. 'In the end I felt relief for Coco but it . was so hard to watch her slip away. I didn’t realise till that moment . the machine was switched off that she had been in so much pain. 'I felt instant love when I saw her but . holding her was the most awful and amazing feeling at the same time. On . the one hand she was in my arms and finally looked happy after two days . of pain, but on the other I lost my beautiful baby daughter. 'I was so upset reliving that day over . and over in my head, but I feel as if I need to put my energy into . something and warn other parents to be vigilant about the virus. Slapped cheek syndrome is a type of viral infection that is most . common in children, although it can affect anyone of any age.  It is . caused by a virus called parvovirus B19 and the most . common symptom is the appearance of a distinctive bright red rash on the . cheeks. Other symptoms can include painful joints and swollen limbs. Pregnant women who have not had the infection before have an increased . risk of a miscarriage. In one in three cases the mother passes the virus . on to the unborn child, which can then cause severe anaemia. This in turn can cause heart failure and an abnormal collection of fluid inside the baby’s tissues. Due to this risk, mothers with the virus are given regular ultrasound . scans so that the health of the baby can be carefully assessed. If . they do show signs of severe anaemia, they may be treated with a . blood transfusion.The risk of miscarriage is highest in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy, at around 1 in 10, but then drops sharply as the pregnancy . progresses. 'I would urge pregnant women who have the symptoms to get themselves checked out straight away before it’s too late - if I’d have known, I would have gone a lot sooner.' Parvovirus B19 is a common childhood . viral illness with about half of all adults infected when they were . children. They may may develop a rash, joint pain or swelling and other symptoms can include headaches, a mild fever or sore throat. Devastated: Simone and Oliver with daughter Coco's memory box .

However, Parvovirus B19 infection in a . pregnant women can cause the unborn baby to have severe anaemia and the . woman may have a miscarriage. Ms Richardson said: 'Because I’d never had Parvovirus in childhood, my body didn’t have the antibodies to fight it off and protect the baby and she became anaemic, her kidneys stopped working and her heart had also swelled. 'I still don’t know how or where I contracted Parvovirus but people can have it and not even know.

"These are the two men accused of breaching White House security less than 24 hours apart: an Iraq veteran who allegedly jumped the fence carrying a knife, and a teenager who drove up to the gates and refused to leave. Omar Gonzalez, 42, was arrested Friday inside the Presidential residence with a knife in his pants after making it over the fence and running across the lawn, the Secret Service said. And on Saturday afternoon Kevin Carr, 19, was taken in by officers after allegedly driving a car up to a screening point then refusing to leave when he was asked. White House pair: Omar Gonzalez, a 42-year-old Iraq veteran (left) and Kevin Carr, a 19-year-old college student (right) were both arrested after trying to get into the White House within 24 hours of one another . 'Intelligent, reasonable': Friends told MailOnline they had no idea why Carr would have got himself arrested . Both men are expected to appear in court Monday. It has since emerged that Gonzalez, from Copperas Cove, Texas, is an Army veteran who served three tours of duty in Iraq, lost part of his foot in an IED blast, and suffers from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. According to agents who arrested him, Gonzalez said that he was desperate to see the President to warn him about 'the atmosphere collapsing'. And MailOnline can revealed that Carr, from Shamong, New Jersey, is a college student, whose arrest has bewildered friends and family. The two attempts to gain entry to the White House prompted the Secret Service to increase security by stepping up patrols around the building. It has been suggested they could set up security checkpoints around the building for the public. President Obama and his family were not inside the White House when either incident took place. Obama and two of his daughters had left for Camp David via helicopter just minutes before Gonzalez allegedly rushed the northern entrance. Easy as pie: An intruder (left) simply hopped the White House fence and somehow made it all the way to the Executive Mansion before the Secret Service was able to stop him. A security guard (right) watched incredulously as the man ran in from the street to President Obama's home . The Secret Service said that Carr had first approached the White House on foot Saturday afternoon, and left when he was told to. But, agents claim, he later returned in a white, four-door sedan and drove to a security checkpoint, which he refused to leave. Bomb teams were sent to investigate the vehicle while Carr was arrested. Tonight friends of Carr described him as an 'intelligent' and 'reasonable' young man who was on vacation in Washington D.C. - and had no reason to attempt to get inside the White House. One told MailOnline: 'I've know Kevin for three or four years and he is one of the smartest, most reasonable people we know and we are all sure this incident is a misunderstanding.' Arrested: Kevin Carr, 19 of New Jersey, was arrested after he allegedly refused to leave a restricted area near the White House.

Carr . has been charged with unauthorized access, among other crimes, the . Philadelphia Inquirer reported. Gonzalez has been charged with . unlawfully entering a restricted building while carrying a 'deadly or . dangerous weapon'. Weapon? Gonzalez was allegedly carrying this model of blade - the three-and-a-half-inch Spyderco VG-10 folding knife . A . former stepson of Gonzalez has said that he is never without his knife - . a three-and-half-inch folding blade. Jerry Murphy added that if Gonzalez had wanted to bring more dangerous weapons, he could have. At . a hearing late Saturday afternoon in D.C.

'This . is someone who has provided service to his country and shown commitment . in his life,' said the lawyer, Margarita O'Donnell, as she tried . unsuccessfully to get Gonzalez released. The . Army said Gonzalez enlisted in July 1997 and was assigned to the 10th . Cavalry Regiment, 2nd Brigade, 4th Infantry Division, at Fort Hood, . Texas. At the time, he listed his home as Puerto Rico.

Gonzalez enlisted a second time, in July 2005, and served . until his retirement in late 2012. During this period, he was assigned to the 1st Squadron, 14th Cavalry Regiment, at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington state, and the 4th Squadron, 9th Cavalry Regiment, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division at Ford Hood, Texas. Gonzalez served in Iraq from October 2006 to January 2008. An unidentified family member said: 'His job was running patrols in Baghdad when his Humvee was hit.' He added, 'A portion of his foot was amputated - and the evidence is the limp you see in the video of him running across the White House lawn.' A police affidavit, seen by ABC News, said Gonzalez had a Spyderco VG-10 black folding knife in the front pocket of his pants when he was arrested. In the wake of his attempt on the White House, the Secret Service announced new, tougher security. Uniformed Secret Service officers walk Saturday along the fence that an intruder hopped to get into the White House a day earlier . Uniformed Secret Service officers do a security sweep along the lawn on the North side of the White House on Saturday . The agency was criticized for not apprehending Gonzalez sooner, and admitted their performance was 'not acceptable,' leading to new measures being put in place. President Obama and his family were not in the White House at the time, but had left just moments before by helicopter. In a statement, Secret Service officials said: 'The challenge of securing the White House . complex from security threats is ever present. 'Although last night the . officers showed tremendous restraint and discipline in dealing with this . subject, the location of Gonzalez’s arrest is not acceptable. Guns at the ready: An armed Secret Service guard stands in front of a fence with an automatic rifle . Response: Flashing lights could be seen gathered in front of the South Portico of the building Friday . 'In . addition to the criminal investigation of Gonzalez by the Secret .

The . statement continued: 'In the interim, Director Pierson has ordered the . immediate enhancement of officer patrols and surveillance capabilities . along the Pennsylvania Avenue fence line around the White House complex. These measures went into effect last night.' President Obama has backed the agency. A White House spokesman said: 'The president has full confidence in the Secret Service and is grateful to the men and women who day in and day out protect himself, his family and the White House.' The spokesman did not directly address the issue of the second intruder. Evacuation: A Secret Service guard gives directions during the White House evacuation . For . the Secret Service, the breaches were a devastating episode that prompted . fresh questions about the storied agency and its ability to protect the . president. The . Republican Party's Jason Chaffetz, who chairs the House of . Representatives' subpanel on national security oversight, called it . 'totally unacceptable' but said the incident was just one of a string of . security failings on the Secret Service's watch. 'Unfortunately, . they are failing to do their job,' Chaffetz said. 'These are good men . and women, but the Secret Service leadership has a lot of questions to . answer.' 'Was the door open?' he added incredulously. Leaving: Members of the media were herded out of the White House after the intruder approached . Flying away: Obama, his daughter Sasha (second left) and an unidentified friend (left) were pictured heading to the Presidential retreat at Camp David . Experts say Friday's breach was the first time in recent memory that an intruder actually made it inside the White House after hopping the fence. The attempts, however, have been many: . Sept. 11: A 'Pokemon' nut wearing a bright-yellow Pikachu hat was caught walking down the North Lawn seconds after jumping. His motives remain unclear. Aug. 7: A presidential address on Iraq was postponed — and the whole place put on lockdown — after a toddler squeezed through the fence on Pennsylvania Avenue, making it onto the lawn. June 2013: Joseph Reel, of Ohio, crashed a driverless Jeep into the fence to create a distraction so he could enter and spray paint the White House. He was sentenced to 3 years behind bars. November 2009: Three people crashed a state dinner for Indian Premier Manmohan Singh. They somehow made it past several security checkpoints and even met President Obama. 2001-2009: Six people jumped the fence — but were all caught almost immediately after landing on the grass. One of them, Brian Patterson, was on his third attempt when he was caught in April 2006 . Although . it is not uncommon for people to make it over the White House fence, . they're typically stopped almost immediately and rarely get very far. Video . from the scene showed the Friday intruder, Gonzalez, sprinting across the lawn as Secret . Service agents shouted at nearby pedestrians to clear the area. 'This situation was a little different than other incidents we have at the White House,' Donovan said. 'This . incident . is the most shocking example yet of how dangerously lax the Secret . Service has become, failing at its most basic job — to protect the . president and first family in the White House,' said Washington insider . Ronald Kessler, who's written several books on the Secret Service. He added to MailOnline: 'Because of corner cutting and an ingrained cultural attitude by . management of ""we make do with less,"" the Secret Service is not . protecting the White House with adequate agents and uniformed officers . and is not keeping up to date with the latest devices for detecting . intruders and weapons of mass destruction' Kessler . — who revealed the embarrassing scandal about Secret Service agents . hiring prostitutes in Colombia — said it's 'arrogance' that the White . House doesn't even have a front door lock. 'If . the intruder were carrying chemical, biological or radiological weapons . and President Obama and his family had been in, we would have had a . dead president as well as a dead first family,' said Kessler, who . authored 'The First Family Detail: Secret Service Agents Reveal the .

"The director of the U.S. Secret Service offered an apology on Tuesday for security lapses that allowed a knife-wielding intruder to get into the White House through an unlocked door, down a hallway and into the East Room. 'It is clear that our security plan was not executed properly,' Secret Service Director Julia Pierson told lawmakers. 'I take full responsibility; what happened is unacceptable and it will never happen again.' But Congressman Stephen Lynch, a Massachusetts Democrat, excoriated Pierson for her agents lax attention as Gonzales gave himself 'half of a White House tour' while he ran. Omar Gonzalez, a 42-year-old military veteran, got past five rings of security on September 19 after jumping a fence on the White House's outer perimeter. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS .

Dash: A video of the incident shows Gonzalez running towards the White House after getting past plainclothes security guards outside the fence. SWAT teams and an attack dog failed to stop him on the lawn . Route: Gonzalez allegedly made it 168 feet into the building, through the North Portico hall to the East Room . He was only tackled, The Washington Post reported Tuesday, because an off-duty agent happened to be in the White House, leaving for the night. 'To talk about somebody traversing the White House foyer, the full length of the East Room, down to the Green Room – to the American public that would be half of a White House tour,' Lynch barked during a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing. 'That's what that would be.' President Obama appointed Julia Pierson the first female director of the U.S. Secret Service in April 2013 at a time when agents were attracting barbs for patronizing prostitutes during a security 'advance' visit to Colombia. The agents were forced to resign, and Obama was pressured to hire a woman to remake the agency's public image. Only about 10 per cent of the 3,500 Secret Service agents are female. Pierson studied criminal justice at the University of Central Florida and served for three years with the Orlando Police Department; she was among the first female officers assigned to a beat on that force. She served on the Presidential Protective Detail for President George H.W. Bush, and was put in charge of overseeing protective details for presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. Moving her up the chain of command made sense in 2013: Pierson was already serving as chief of staff to then-director Mark Sullivan. Her working life started in a less-serious way, however. As a teenager, she worked at nearby Disney World as a parking lot attendant – and even did a stint in the theme park as a costumed character in parades. 'That isn't just getting inside the portico. That's half of a White House tour, to the American public.' Pierson provided a moment-by-moment account of what happened. 'As Mr. Gonzales entered the door, he knocked back the officer that was standing at the doorway,' she said. 'The officer did engage Mr. Gonzales; they crossed the east entrance hall together, made the left turn down the cross-hall and stepped momentarily into the East Room.' 'Another officer rendered aid,' she concluded, 'and he was placed on the ground, on the carpet, in handcuffs on the cross-hall just outside the green room.' Pierson later said Gonzales had 'a folding knife in his front pants pocket' when he was apprehended. Committee chairman Darrell Issa, a California Republican, was outraged at the lack of basic security at a doorway commonly used by tourists, given the size of the agency's budget. '$800 million a year, millions of dollars or more during your tenure, each year, than the president's request,' Issa said, his voice rising near shouting level. 'And that door was unlocked with no one standing at it when Mr. Gonzales came through?' Pierson conceded that 'the front door at the time did not have an automatic locking mechanism,' adding that 'it required an individual to hand-lock the door.' She underscored the rarity of a White House fence-jumper getting more than a few feet inside the perimeter. 'The Secret Service has apprehended 16 individuals who have jumped the fence over the last five years, including six this year alone,' she said. 'In fact, on September 11, 2014, a week prior to the events that are the subject of today’s hearing, officers apprehended an individual seconds after he scaled the fence and ran onto the grounds.' Issa said Tuesday in an opening statement that questions remain about what happened. 'How could Mr. Gonzalez scale the fence and why didn’t officers immediately apprehend him?' he asked. 'How was he able to sprint 70 yards, almost an entire football field, without being intercepted by guards inside the fence line?' 'Why didn’t security dogs stop him in his tracks? What about the SWAT team? Why was no guard stationed at the front door of the White House? And why was the door left unlocked?' Pierson, the first female Secret Service director, was appointed by President Obama as an antidote to prostitution scandals that plagued the agency's iconic personnel . After the horse has bolted: Secret Service members in a very public display of protection today on the roof of the White Hous . Utah Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz claimed during Tuesday's hearing that an internal Secret Service report found '1,000 security breaches and vulnerabilities.' It's not clear how serious those 'vulnerabilities' are. 'You really have to question if security is their number one objective,' Chaffetz told the hearing room. 'They want to be politically correct.' He insisted that the services's internal culture has changed for the worse since the 9/11 terror attacks in 2001. After the federal government recovered from the attacks, a dedicated Department of Homeland Security was added to the presidential cabinet – and it was given control of the Secret Service. Previously, the Treasury Department ran the service, because its original purpose was to root out banknote counterfeiters. Also after 9/11, Secret Service Director became a position that required U.S. Senate confirmation. 'It seems to me,' Chaffetz said, that the change made that job 'much more of a political appointee as opposed to a director who is a career servant person.' The East Room of the White House is an 80-foot-long hall used for formal events including bill signings, press conferences, receptions and ceremonies. A Secret Service official who spoke on condition of anonymity told the Washington Post an alarm box near the front entrance of the White House had been muted.

Omar Gonzalez made it all the way into the East Room of the White House before Secret Service agents subdued him . Troubled: In an undated photograph, Gonzalez poses with his former wife Samantha before an overseas deployment. She explained she split up with him due to his deteriorating mental state . Separately, a report revealed this month that the Secret Service was unaware for four days that a man had fired a high-powered rifle at the White House in 2011. Officers allegedly fell down on the job after Oscar Ramiro Ortega-Hernandez shot at least seven bullets at the executive mansion on Pennsylvania Avenue from a parked car. At the time, President Barack Obama, his wife Michelle and their older daughter Malia were not at home, but their younger daughter Sasha and Mrs Obama's mother, Marian Robinson, were inside. Gonzalez, a homeless Iraq veteran, was charged with unlawfully entering a restricted building or grounds while carrying a deadly or dangerous weapon. He reportedly expressed no desire to hurt the president or the first family, claiming that he wanted to tell Obama the 'atmosphere was collapsing.' A federal prosecutor told a judge last week that officers found more than 800 rounds of ammunition, two hatchets and a machete in Gonzalez's car. The prosecutor said Gonzalez was also arrested in July with a sniper rifle and a map with the White House clearly marked.","Democratic congressman: Intruder got 'half of a White House tour' while running from Secret Service .

"Around 1.3million families face losing their homes after taking out mortgages which they have little or no hope of repaying, a major report reveals today. Many householders on ‘interest-only’ deals have failed to make provision for paying back the capital, the Financial Conduct Authority concludes. When their mortgages expire, they could be forced to sell their family homes or borrow money from friends or family to make up the shortfall. Others face extending their mortgages well into their 70s. Homeowners with an interest-only mortgage could be forced to sell their property or borrow money to pay back the capital . Asked how they planned to repay the capital, some admitted their only hope was that they will have died before their bank asks for its money back. The FCA believes the mortgage timebomb will hit 40,000 people a year between 2017 and 2032, many of whom will be over the age of 65 when their loan matures. It said its report was a ‘wake-up call’ for the 2.6million householders with interest-only mortgages, which allow them to pay off only the interest. At the end of the term, they are supposed to have amassed enough in savings or equity to pay off the capital. However, the FCA found that the average amount owed on interest-only loans is £72,000, with many owing more than double that. The FCA report warns that a shocking 48 per cent of such borrowers either have no way of repaying the loan, or will fall woefully short of the amount they need. Around 260,000 have no strategy at all for repaying the debt. Many said they planned to ‘downsize’ to a smaller home, while others were pinning their hopes on inheriting a lump sum from a relative. Heartbreak: Colin and Mandy Mee have an interest-only mortgage and are worried they will be forced to sell their home in Darlington . Colin and Mandy Mee have no idea how they will pay off their £119,000 mortgage in 2028. Mr Mee took out the interest-only loan on a three-bedroom semi-detached home in Darlington in 2005. He was attracted by the £466-a-month payments with a 4.7 per cent interest rate. The couple planned to switch to a repayment loan but Mr Mee was made redundant last year. The couple now play in a Fifties-style wedding band called the Mee Kats, with 50-year-old Mrs Mee on the double-bass. A repayment mortgage would raise their monthly payments to £675, which they could no longer afford. Their house is now worth £150,000 and they are considering selling it before the capital is due. Mr Mee said: ‘I keep saying to Mandy that when we need to retire we are going to be forced to sell up if we haven’t paid off the mortgage by then. That would be heart-breaking because I love everything about this place. In a worst-case scenario, we can take the equity and rent. ‘What would really scare me is if our bank tried to push us back on to a repayment loan tomorrow because there is absolutely no way we could afford it.’ In addition, many borrowers are already in dire financial straits, with one in ten having ‘in excess of £25,000 of unsecured borrowing’, including credit card bills, overdrafts and payday loans. The report said 65,000 householders believe they were mis-sold the mortgages and claim they had no idea they would be expected to repay the original loan. Over the next 12 months, homeowners whose loans are due to mature within the next seven years are to be sent a formal letter to warn them about the problem. Interest-only mortgages were sold by many banks and building societies until 2009, with some people allowed to borrow more than seven times their salary. Interest-only mortgages have almost disappeared from the mortgage market, with lenders such as Nationwide refusing to sell them to new customers . The FCA made it clear that borrowers – not their banks – must take responsibility for the loans that they took out. Martin Wheatley, chief executive, said: ‘My advice to borrowers is to not bury your head in the sand. Take action now.’ The Council of Mortgage Lenders echoed the FCA, saying: ‘The responsibility for repaying the mortgage lies with the customer.’ Richard Lloyd, executive director of consumer watchdog Which?, said: ‘Lenders should recognise their responsibility, communicate clearly with their customers and explain all the options available to help them. It is essential that customers trapped on their current mortgage are treated fairly, and lenders must show forbearance to people who are struggling.’ Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, said interest-only mortgages had helped many people to buy their first home, but added: ‘It is not suitable for everyone. In retrospect, perhaps at the height of the market, interest-only mortgages were dished out rather too freely.’ Interest-only mortgages have almost disappeared from the mortgage market, with lenders such as Nationwide and the Co-op refusing to sell them to new customers. By Simon Lambert, of  Mail Online's This is Money . The report suggests bright young things are trapped by big mortgages, says Simon Lambert . The interest-only timebomb ticking away for borrowers has been laid bare again. We have long warned about this issue and have even built our own wake-up alarm calculator (below) to help people understand it. It's . important to note that not all interest-only mortgages are bad. Used . sensibly they can be an efficient and flexible way to borrow. But . the new Financial Conduct Authority report identifies in its great . detail a band of borrowers we have warned about – dubbed the Bright . Futures. These are young professionals with good career prospects who borrowed big to get on the property ladder in the late boom years. There is a disproportionate number of them in London and the South, . where house prices are highest - many of them also carry large amounts . of personal unsecured debt on credit cards and loans. A shift to a repayment loan would mean . severe cutbacks to their spending - and hamper their chance of saving, . especially for retirement. As . someone in my mid-30s, I know plenty of them - they are my peers in . good jobs who cannot really afford their sizeable mortgages. They bought properties before the 2007 peak and were encouraged by lenders and brokers to go for broke. In . fact, when my wife and I bought our first flat in 2006 we were openly . invited to borrow more and buy a more expensive home by going . interest-only. We turned that offer down, but many didn't. The . FCA report quite rightly identifies that this chunk of borrowers have . the time and the earnings potential to switch to a repayment mortgage . and get the debt cleared. The . only problem is that while that may be true over the next two decades . or so, it doesn't mean they can afford to stump up the extra £500 a . month they may need to switch to a repayment loan now. And . with lenders having called time on interest-only loans that means they . can't move or remortgage, putting their own crunch moment a lot closer . than they think. This calculator shows borrowers with no plan to repay an interest-only loan, or whose investments have fallen short, how much extra you may have to find if your lender forced you on to a repayment mortgage. Enter the amount still owed on your mortgage to find out how much a move to a repayment mortgage could cost you.","May have to borrow money from family or friends to make up shortfall .

"A photographer has used his seven-year-old daughter's Lego to recreate the works of street artist Banksy. Jeff Friesen has recreated many of the mysterious street artist's iconic works from the plastic bricks. The 42-year-old from Halifax, Canada, used his daughter June's Lego to complete the project he calls Bricksy. Friesen has recreated many of the street artist's iconic works like Peel Ficton which Friesen calls Banana Pulp .

He said: 'A lot of time is spent looking for Lego parts, as my daughter has access to the same brick collection, which are technically hers. 'It is challenging to make gritty street scenes in clean, modernist Lego bricks, though there is a fun irony to it. I also wanted to do more than a straightforward recreation of Banksy's work, not always successfully. 'For example, in The Mother of Anarchy the scene is zoomed out from Banksy's original and includes the surrounding trashed buildings and riot police.'

"In a claim reportedly worth $1.62 billion, Brisbane-born dance choreographer Wade Robson alleges he was extensively molested, raped and even called 'son' by Michael Jackson. Mr Robson, 31, met Jackson as a five-year-old and claims the dead singer sexually abused him from age seven to 14. He alleges the molestation took place at the late singer's Santa Barbara County ranch and other locations in the from 1990 until 1997 although Jackson's estate lawyers have called the accusations outrageous and pathetic, reported Radar Online. Choreographer Wade Robson, pictured left, alleges Michael Jackson, pictured right, molested him. The deceased singer faced various molestation allegations and charges throughout his career . The claims, including that Mr Robson posed naked during sex acts, were revealed in a 111-page document filed against the singer's estate, MJJ productions, in the Los Angeles Superior Court, reported News.com.au. The documents state the late singer told Mr Robson if anyone found out about the sexual acts, both their careers would be over and that they would go to jail. Allegations also include Jackson inviting Mr Robson and his family to stay at his ranch in February, 1990. Its also alleged Jackson’s company helped Mr Robson apply for a U.S. work visa and employed his mother Joy in 1991. Mr Robson met Jackson as a five-year-old and said alleges he was sexually abused from seven to 14 . Mr Robson accuses Jackson of first molesting him at the Neverland Ranch, while his sister slept in a separate bed just metres away. The estate has asked to court to reject the claims on the basis that Mr Robson waited too long to file and because Jackson is the only other person with knowledge about the accusations and has been dead for more than five years. The claims come after years of supporting the U.S. singer through child abuse allegations. In 2005, Mr Robson even testified in court that Jackson had never sexually abused him and this helped the singer beat charges of molestation in California. The Australian said the birth of his son, Jackson's death and therapy that followed two breakdowns triggered his understanding that he had been molested. Jackson's estate has rubbished the claims and has asked the court to reject them .","Choreographer Wade Robson alleges Michael Jackson molested him .

"A British trawler suspected of illegally dredging scallops was ordered into a French port today and her captain threatened with prison. In the latest round of a maritime dispute between the two nations, the Van Dijck was forced to berth at Ouistreham, Normandy. She was suspected of dredging at least 17 tons of scallops in French territorial waters. Conflict: A British fishing trawler (not pictured) suspected of illegally dredging scallops was ordered into a French port today and her crew threatened with prison.This picture shows French and British boats during the first clash last year . The haul was thrown back in the sea after the French Navy carried out an on-board inspection  12 nautical miles from the coast. Gary Smith, the Van Dijck’s skipper, faces charges of violating French . territorial waters while switching off his monitoring system in an . effort to avoid arrest. The two crimes carry a maximum sentence of one year in prison and fines . of £80,000. Rude: . French fisherman seen offering rude hand gestures and burning England . rugby shirts during a dispute over scallop fishing areas . Mr Smith insists that he had to turn . off his so-called transponder to stop other vessels following him into . French waters after he miscalculated his position. But he now has to pay 50,000 euros (£40,740) bail to get back to the UK before a French court hearing on May 15 in Caen. The Royal Navy was deployed to protect British fishermen during the Cod Wars with Iceland in  the 1970s. In 1972, Iceland had declared an Exclusive Economic Zone beyond its own territorial waters while announcing plans to reduce over-fishing. This led to the Icelandic Coastguard cutting the nets of British trawlers that fished in the area. The UK retaliated by deploying Royal Navy warships to protect British fishing crews. There followed a number of stand-offs between UK and Icelandic vessels, which included them ramming each other. The lengthy dispute finally  ended in 1976 when Iceland threatened to close a vital Nato base in retaliation for the deployment  of the Navy. The British Government conceded that UK vessels would no longer fish within the disputed 200- nautical-mile limit. The Van Dijck is now under guard in . Ouistreham, which is Caen’s port, with French prosecutor Bruno Albisetti . confirming that Mr Smith claims he  ‘miscalculated his position by . failing to take into account low tide’. The owner of the Van Dijck tonight said the ship's incursion was a mistake. Andrew McCloud added: 'My skipper strayed into French territory. The limit is 12 miles and she was about 11.6 miles.' In October, the Van Dijck was one of five British trawlers attacked by Gallic fishermen brandishing iron bars, flares and rocks. A force made up of some 40 French boats steamed into them while they were trying to collect scallops off the port of Le Havre. The British insisted they had been . fishing legally in international waters, while the French say they were . encroaching into their own waters, while also ruining efforts to . preserve stocks. Mr Smith and his crew then vowed not . to be ‘intimated’ by threats of a  250-boat French armada blocking their . passage through the English Channel. Today Richard Brouzes, head of the Lower Normandy fisherman’s organisation, OPBN, appealed for calm. Mr Brouzes said: ‘If this boat was . stopped then perhaps it had entered the 12-mile zone where the numbers . of scallops are perhaps higher. It’s tempting, but error is human, and . it’s happened before that French boats have strayed into British . waters.’ Pointing to the fact that the scallop . population is around 50 per cent higher than normal this year, Mr . Brouzes said: ‘There are enough scallops for everyone. Our fisherman . have other worries.’ But, as the Scallop Wars escalate, . the French and British are due to hold talks over fishing rights later . this year after a French fishing industry representative blocked a deal . in September. In a separate hearing on Wednesday, . the Caen prosecutor called for a year fishing ban on a Scottish trawler, . the Mattanja, and a fine of 20,000 euros (£16,300 ) for identical . offences in September. A verdict is due on January 16. Frustration: Angry French protestors have called on EU authorities to impose a temporary ban . on fishing for scallops claiming that overfishing had reduced sizes of . shellfish and catches . Anger: French trawlers confront the larger British trawler, in the centre of the picture,  during the standoff . The Van Dijck is registered in Brixham, Devon, and owned by Englishman Andrew McLeod. In October Mr McLeod said the Royal Navy should be used to protect fishermen from further attacks by the French. Mr McLeod said: 'Protection from the Royal Navy is something we've been asking for for some time.' He said the British had been in negotiations with the French over access to the rich scallop beds 15 miles off the coast of Caen. The Van Dijck’s crew painted Union Jack on the boat’s side, and pledged to resist efforts by the French to intimidate them.

"Paris Saint-Germain striker Edinson Cavani is set to reject advances from Manchester United after the club's failure to qualify for next season's Champions League, according to reports. The 27-year-old has been linked with a move to Old Trafford, but French publication L'Equipe states United's absence in Europe means the forward would prefer to stay in Paris. The paper also claims that Cavani was . unhappy with his position in the PSG team, but following talks with the . club, he has decided to remain at the Parc des Princes. Not interested: L'Equipe reports that Edinson Cavani will stay at PSG despite Manchester United's interest . All smiles: Edinson Cavani joined PSG for £55million on a five-year-deal from Napoli in July 2013 . The Uruguay forward netted 22 goals in 39 appearances to help the club achieve a league and cup double - despite often playing out wide to allow talisman Zlatan Ibrahimovic the lone role up front. Cavani joined the Parisian outfit on a five-year-deal for £55million from Italian outfit Napoli in July 2013. Prior to the move, the striker scored 78 goals in three seasons in Naples to make him one of the world's the most coveted forwards. The capture of Cavani would have bolstered United's striking department which already boasts Robin van Persie, Wayne Rooney, Javier Hernandez and Danny Welbeck. He will have the chance to put himself in the shop window during the World Cup and Premier League clubs will have an especially keen eye on him when he faces England on June 19.

"A spurned lover has been convicted of assaulting her partner - by biting his penis during a row. Sinead Walker, 40, had gone to her ex-partner Vincent Rennoldson’s flat in Bath, Somerset, to apologise for an earlier argument during which she had assaulted him. But when Mr Rennoldson, 42, asked her to leave, she became abusive and lashed out at him, at which point he dialled 999. While he was on the phone, the mother-of-one - who had consumed an entire bottle of wine - pulled down his boxer shorts, grabbed his penis, tried to tear it off - and then bit it. Scroll down for video . When Vincent Rennoldson's ex-partner attacked him, he called the police - who heard his screams as his jilted lover tried to bite his penis off . Mr Rennoldson was assaulted by his ex-girlfriend, Sinead Walker, 40 (right). The mother . of one had drunk an entire bottle of wine before visiting him at his . flat to apologise for a previous row but she then turned violent . Walker claimed that the wound was the result of vigorous love-making but . Mr Rennoldson's spine-chilling screams were overheard by an emergency . operator during the attack. She was found guilty of assault on Monday after her ex-partner told a court his genitalia had been left permanently scarred. The . father-of-three, speaking after the case, said: 'It was horrific - she . came around to say sorry and ended up trying to bite my penis off. 'She was on her knees, got it in her hands and just started biting. I just screamed - the pain was excruciating. 'There was a lot of blood and it was painful for weeks afterwards. I now have a three-inch scar on the bottom of my willy. Vincent Rennoldson, pictured at his flat in Bath, Somerset . 'It has affected me - I was watching . Jaws the other night but had to turn over. If you hit or kick someone . that’s one thing - but biting them down there is another thing. 'It could have been worse - she could have bitten it off. At least it still works.' Bath . Magistrates' Court was told that trouble between the pair, who had been . dating for ten months, first flared on December 14 last year. Jill . MacNamara, prosecuting, said Walker had downed several pints of cider . before flying into a rage and snarling: 'What’s your f***ing problem?'. Walker then punched and kicked her partner after he refused to let her leave his flat until police arrived. Mr Rennoldson could be heard saying 'she’s giving me a kicking' on a frantic 999 call played to the court. Two . weeks later, on December 28, Walker - on bail accused of the first . assault - returned to his flat with friends to apologise over drinks. But the jobless mother, who was drunk, again began directing abuse at her former partner, at around 5pm. She then lashed out with her fists when he asked her and a friend to get out. Mr . Rennoldson, choking back the tears, described how she then pulled down . his boxer shorts and bit his penis while he was on the phone to the . police. He told the court: 'She pushed me against the wall in the hallway and pulled my boxer shorts down. 'She grabbed my penis and tried to pull it off. She was on the floor - then she bit it. 'I have now got a scar on it - I will show anybody. She tried to bite my penis off.' Walker left the flat shortly afterwards, but was later arrested. Pictures of bruises and scratches to his upper arms, neck and elbow from the attack - as well as the genital injury - were shown to magistrates. The former shop fitter’s screams - as Walker bit down on him - were also played to the court from his 999 call. Ms MacNamara said: 'You can hear him . under attack. That is the best version of events he can give to what . happened - what he was saying at the time.' The attack, in Bath (above), has left him with a three-inch scar . Walker, from Bath, denied two counts of common assault over the December 14 and December 28 attacks. She claimed she caused some of the injuries to Mr Rennoldson in self-defence, while trying to fight her way out of the flat. But she insisted she had not bitten his penis. Erinna Foley-Fisher, defending, said: 'The defendant has done her best to account for his injuries - saying they could have happened during sexual intercourse.' But magistrates took less than an hour to find her guilty on both counts of assault. Gail Bragg, chair of the bench, said: 'We find Mr Rennoldson’s injuries are consistent with the 999 calls and the photographs. 'We do not accept Ms Walker’s claims that it was self-defence.' Walker, who has no previous convictions, was released on bail before sentencing at the same court on May 8, on the condition she did not contact her former partner. She did not comment on leaving court.","Vincent Rennoldson, 42, now has 3-inch scar where she bit him while he was on phone to police .

"Rev Al Sharpton was in an oversharing mood Wednesday when he denied fathering the troubled teenage son of a prominent City Hall official who had worked for him in the past. Sharpton made the unprompted remarks during a press conference about his tax debt troubles. A report published by the New York Times suggested that the 60-year-old Mr Sharpton and his non-profit businesses owed as much as $4.5mllion to the Internal Revenue Service in unpaid state and federal taxes. The kid is not my son: Unprompted, Rev Al Sharpton (left) denied Wednesday fathering the troubled teenage son of City Hall official Rachael Noerdlinger (right) It wasn't him: Ms Noerdlinger stated that her son, Khari (pictured), was born in 1996, more than two years before she first met Rev Sharpton . After blasting the Times' front-page piece about his financial foibles as 'misleading' because it failed to emphasize that much of that figure stems from penalties and back taxes that are steadily being paid down as part of settlement, Sharpton unexpectedly brought up Rachel Noerdlinger. Noerdlinger, 44, the chief of staff to Mayor Bill de Blasio's wife, announced Tuesday that she would be taking time off following the Friday night arrest of her 17-year-old son, Khari, on a trespassing charge. The civil rights activist and MSNBC host, who is married with two children, told the assembled reporters that he has reached out to Ms Noerdlinger, his former press secretary, to talk to her about her son. 'I’m concerned, I watched him grow up,’ Sharpton said, according to the New York Post. ‘Ironically, about eight months ago, a reporter was running around trying to prove that I was Khari’s father. You remember that. High-ranking: Rachel Noerdlinger, 44, is the chief of staff to the New York Mayor's First Lady Chirlane McCray. Pictured: Noerdlinger and her 17-year-old son Khari . Off topic: Sharpton made the comments about Noerdlinger, his former employee, while addressing his alleged IRS troubles concerning $4.5million in liens . ‘We’ve been through all of this before. I’ve gone from you know being too close to politicians, to being too close to entertainers and people’s father that I’m not.’ After Sharpton's news conference at the National Action Network headquarters, Ms Noerdlinger sent the New York Daily News an email saying that she first met Rev Sharpton only in January 1999. 'Khari Noerdlinger was born on December 20, 1996,' she noted. On Monday, Ms Noerdlinger, a single mother, announced she would be taking a leave of absence after Khari was arrested for allegedly trespassing in a building which is known as a drug hot spot in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan. He was apprehended with three friends, two of whom were in possession of small amounts of marijuana, law enforcement sources said. The indefinite leave from her $170,000-a-year job is unpaid, according to a City Hall source, reports the New York Post.  It wasn't immediately clear when, or if, Noerdlinger would return. 'Today I am announcing that I have decided to take a leave of absence to spend more time with my son,' Noerdlinger said in a statement. Dangerous liaison: Rachel Noerdlinger (center), chief of staff of the first lady of New York City, has been living with convicted killer Hassaun McFarlan (right) since 2010 . 'These past two months have been extremely difficult for both of us, and his arrest on Friday heightens the need for me to devote my full attention to Khari, my number one priority.' She added that her son 'has been subjected to attacks' which she said had nothing to do with 'public interest, and everything to do with derailing this administration. In response to her statement, Rebecca Katz, a special adviser to Mayor de Blasio said: 'The Mayor and first lady thank Rachel for her service.' 'She has been a great asset to the administration and the people of New York City over the past year, and everyone wishes her all the best during her leave.' Khari, who made headlines recently after he posted explicit messages about cops and women on his Twitter page, was taken to court on Saturday - a day after his mother's 44th birthday. 'While he is still a teen, he is entering into adulthood, and he must take responsibility for his actions,' Noerdlinger said in a statement. 'This issue is now a family matter that we will address privately at home.' Noerdlinger has been in a serious relationship with ex-convict Hassaun McFarlan, 36, since 2010. Friends in high places: Noerdlinger (center) pictured with her current boss, Mayor Bill de Blasio (left), and her former employer, Rev Al Sharpton (right) Last month, he sparked a controversy after reportedly leaving explicit comments on a hip-hop blog touting his love for violent sex. McFarlan's criminal history includes drug-trafficking and driving offenses, and in September he was linked to distasteful and explicit posts on a music blog, in which he allegedly solicited women to talk about violent sex with him. The comments, posted on the Hip Hop News 24-7 blog, asked female users whether they are 'turned on when a man plays rough with you'. the New York Post reported. Another post complained about the sexual abilities of black women. It said: 'Trying to find the right black woman with a mean [sex act] game is like trying to find a black woman with good credit.' The words were posted in 2011 under the pseudonym 'stop end frisk'. They have since been deleted but can be seen in search engine data for old versions of the pages. Noerdlinger has denounced the comments - which she acknowledged as coming from her boyfriend - describing them as 'reprehensible'. The chief of staff joined Mayor de Blasio's team in January as an aide to Chirlene McCray, and has attended high-level NYPD meetings. This has raised some eyebrows given her live-in partner's attitude towards police, whom he has described as 'pigs'. His criminal past, dredged up recently by DNAInfo, goes back to his first arrest at age 15 for shooting to death an older boy in a dispute over a goose-down jacket in Harlem. Most recently, he got in trouble with the law last year when he nearly ran over a New Jersey state police officer while driving his girlfriend's Mercedes-Benz, according to court records obtained by the news site. Two of McFarlan's five arrests on charges ranging from driving on a suspended license to drug trafficking took place while he was dating Rachel Noerdlinger. The 43-year-old chief of staff got her start as a publicist representing attorney Johnnie Cochran and prominent civil rights leader Rev Al Sharpton, who later hired her as a public relations adviser for his organization the National Action Network. All the while, Noerdlinger's live-in boyfriend has been raving against police officers on social media. In one post, which has since been removed along with McFarlan's Facebook account, he reportedly wrote: 'I cant come outside without the pigs f***ing with me in the hood.' When asked whether the bombshell revelations could result in her dismissal, de Blasio's spokeswoman Rebecca Katz said: 'Rachel's not going anywhere.' Single mom: The 44-year-old chief of staff, pictured here in November 2013 - around the time of her boyfriend's latest arrest  - is a single mother of one . Katz, however, pointed out that 'no one at city Hall condones criminal behavior or disparagement of the NYPD, including Rachel.' The spokeswoman went on to say that Ms Noerdlinger, a single mother of one, was 'a strong and independent woman' whose core values and believes are in line with the de Blasio administration. Patrolmen's Benevolent Association President Pat Lynch, however, expressed concern regarding Noerdlinger's access to sensitive police information and called into question the aide's judgement. 'It raises serious questions about her judgment and character and the quality of the counsel she provides to City Hall,' he told the Post. 'She should not be in that position.' Attorney Jeffrey Lichtman, who represents Hassaun McFarlan and Rachel Noerdlinger, hit out at her critics saying that she performs her duties as a chief of staff without any input from her boyfriend. 'To her credit, she's a loyal woman and a strong woman and she would not put her career ahead of people she cares about,' said Lichtman. When approached over the comments, McFarlan refused to respond.","Rev Sharpton made the unprompted remarks about Rachel Noerdlinger's son, Khari, at a news conference about his tax troubles Wednesday .

An Egyptian doctor and the father of a 13-year-old female genital mutilation victim have gone on trial after the youngster died during the barbaric procedure. Soheir al-Bata'a suffered an allergic reaction to penicillin following the illegal operation in the Nile Delta medical clinic  in June 2013.

According . to Human Rights group Equality Now, Dr Fadl made several attempts to . block the investigation, even paying the family more than £5,000 to drop . the case.

"Former Everton manager Joe Royle believes Manchester United must appoint a director of football to help new manager Louis van Gaal get the club back on track. United endured a disastrous season under David Moyes after the retirement of Sir Alex Ferguson at the end of the 2012-13 season, culminating in the Scot being sacked just 10 months into his six-year deal at Old Trafford. Moyes and executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward consistently struggled to land their top transfer targets, with only £27.5million flop Marouane Fellaini arriving at the club last summer. Struggles: Manchester United's chief executive vice chairman Ed Woodward (left) has endured a difficult time at Old Trafford .

Juan Mata was signed for a club record fee in January, but Royle is adamant that the appointment of a director of football is vital step forward for United. Royle, who is involved in a new Master's degree in Sporting Directorship at Manchester Metropolitan University, said: 'Football, and sport in general, has never . been more exciting with a global audience transforming the financial . infrastructure of so many businesses but to manage that growth they have . to change and change quickly. 'Football has seen perhaps the biggest growth and one man cannot run the club in the way Sir Alex did.

As a result there is a need to make sure these well-equipped organisations run smoothly and efficiently in high performance, high pressure environments.

Sportsmail revealed in October last year that the Frenchman is keen on a return to England's top-flight, having been without a permanent club role since leaving Anfield in 2012. Comolli spent seven seasons as a European scout for Arsenal between 1996 and 2003, helping to find young talent across the continent. He recommended the signing of Gael Clichy from French club Cannes prior to his departure. After a brief period as technical director of Saint-Etienne, Comolli became director of football at Spurs in 2005 and was charged with overseeing the club's scouting and transfer policy. He returned to France with Saint-Etienne in 2008 to become the club's sporting director, before moving to Liverpool as director of football strategy in November 2010. Although some of Comolli's signings at both clubs were unsuccessful, the 41-year-old can take credit for Liverpool's acquisition of Luis Suarez and Tottenham bringing Gareth Bale and Luka Modric to White Hart Lane.

Para-cycling is among eight sports competing for a maximum of seven remaining places left on the programme for the Games. A statement from the IPC said: 'The UCI only submitted its application late last week. As a result there was insufficient time for it to be assessed in time.

"This is the horrifying moment a man found a dead mouse inside a sausage he had used to make himself a sandwich. Anatol Voronkov, 28, had already munched his way through half the 'high quality meat product' when he spotted something dark lurking inside. He realised it was a mouse or young rat and then showed his wife who was physically sick. Scroll down for video . Anatol Voronkov, 28, from Russia found a mouse inside sausage meat he had used to make a sandwich . 'I thought it was a pepper, but then I realised it was the foot of a rodent. And worse, I then found the foot was attached to the rest of the animal in the middle of the sausage,' said Mr Voronkov. 'I felt really sick but the only good thing was that I was the only one who ate it, and my wife and kids hadn't touched it. And although I felt sick, when I showed my wife she really was sick.' He complained to the environmental health officials and said the factory which made the product should be closed down. 'I didn't want compensation, I want an inspection at the factory and I think it should be closed down if it's standards are as poor as I suspect,' said Mr Voronkov. Mr Voronkov has called for an inspection of the Russian factory which made the product and believes it should be closed down if standards are not being met . 'I bought the sausage from a good store because they promise a high-quality meat product.' The discovery has put him off sausages for life and his wife is now becoming a vegetarian.

"Axed: Columnist Dick Metcalf was canned from Guns & Ammo for promoting gun controls in his December column . The editor of Guns & Ammo magazine apologized to readers and resigned shortly after the writer of a column advocating gun control was fired this week. Dick Metcalf, a well-known television host and gun writer, was canned after penning a column in favour of gun control in the magazine’s December issue. The outrage then prompted editor Jim Bequette to issue an apology and resign. In the apology, Mr Bequette said he hoped the column ‘would generate a healthy exchange of ideas on gun rights,’ but then said he was wrong and asked for forgiveness. Mr Metcalfe, widely visible in the gun community, has written about guns and hosted gun-oriented television shows for decades, but that did not save him from reader backlash. Especially, as the Washington Times noted, when the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence posted the column to its site saying ; the editor (sic) of Guns & Ammo makes an argument for gun regulation.’ ‘I firmly believe that all U.S. citizens have a right to keep and bear arms,’ Mr Metcalf wrote, ‘but I do not believe they have a right to use them irresponsibly.’ The offending column did not say that people should be barred from owning guns. It argued that gun owners should be required to pass a certification similar to owning a car. Not just a columnist: Mr Metcalf also hosted several television programs produced by the magazine's parent company . ‘[Government has] an equal right to enact regulatory laws requiring them to undergo adequate training and preparation for the responsibility of bearing arms,’ Mr Metcalf continued. Mr Metcalf then cites the example set this month by Illinois, which recently enacted a concealed carry weapons regulation that allows for the issuance of a permit after 16 hours of training are completed, which he argued hardly constitutes infringement. Reader backlash was fierce, and action was swift. Writing that he owes every reader an apology, Mr Bequette said the magazine’s ‘commitment to the Second Amendment is unwavering.’ The former editor said Mr Metcalf had been let go and that he made a mistake publishing the column, which he thought would spur healthy debate. Lock shot: Mr Metcalf's aim is usually dead center, but his last column missed the mark with readers . Calling the decision a ‘miscalculation,’ Mr Bequette also announced that plans in place for a new editor to assume control of the magazine in January would be implemented immediately. The pro-gun control column has been removed from the magazine’s site, but is archived on various other webpages. Comments to the apology were mostly negative, with many people saying they had cancelled their subscriptions. Some defended publishing the column, but were shouted down by several antagonistic comments.","Columnist Dick Metcalf has written gun reviews for decades .

Chelsea announced that she was pregnant with her investment banker husband Marc Mezvinsky in April. Last month she quit her $26,000-a-minute reporting job at NBC to focus on her baby. She had been working sporadically at the network since 2011 after winning a reported $600,000-a-year contract to report on stories featuring people or organizations doing public-spirited work. The network confirmed her exit on last month. She was initially hired to do stories for Brian Williams' 'Rock Center' news magazine but that program was canceled. Her work occasionally appeared on NBC's Nightly News. Actresses Eva Longoria (left) and Uma Thurman (right) also attended the event to show their support .

"He is best known for wrapping the Reichstag in fabric and lining California highways with yellow umbrellas - but Christo's latest, almost inconceivable project will dwarf them both. The artist will spend £212m building the 'Mastaba', the world's largest permanent sculpture, from over 400,000 multi-coloured oil barrels in the middle of the desert near Abu Dhabi. The flat-topped pyramid will be 492ft high, just taller than the Great Pyramid of Giza and three times the height of Nelson's Column. Scroll down for video . Artwork: The proposed 'Mastaba', a 490ft tall sculpture constructed from oil barrels and conceived by Christo to be built in the middle of the Abu Dhabi desert . Grand designs: Christo, who is best known for wrapping buildings and bridges in fabric, with a sketch of his latest creation . It is intended to be a landmark for Abu Dhabi - despite being 100 miles from the city itself - in the same way the pyramids are for Egypt and the Eiffel Tower is to Paris, with two million visitors expected annually. Christo and his late wife Jeanne-Claude first envisaged the project 30 years ago, after being inspired by the colourful sands of the desert but its completion has been delayed by various conflicts in the region. The Mastaba chimes with Abu Dhabi's latest ambition to turn itself into a centre of art and culture. The emirate's rulers have approved a site near Liwa oasis, in the south-east of the United Arab Emirates close to the border with Oman. The region is home to some of the highest sand dunes in the middle-east and the yellow and red colours in the sand have inspired the design. Christo said: 'When the sun rises, the vertical wall will become almost full of gold.' Stack: The Mastaba will be made of 410,000 multi-coloured oil barrels, though Christo insists it is not a commentary on the region's oil wealth . Long-held dream: The first sketches of the 490ft flat-topped pyramid structure were drawn up 30 years ago, but conflicts in the region have stalled its construction . Design on the dunes: Christo during a scale model test at the proposed sight neat the Liwa Oasis, 100 miles from Abu Dhabi city in the south-east of the United Arab Emirates . The Bulgarian-born artist, 74, is collaborating with Sheikh Hamdan bin Zayed al-Nayhan, the crown prince’s elder brother, with the royal family ‘very excited to realise the project.’ Although Christo hasn’t said whether the ruling family have contributed financially towards it, he said it had mainly been financed ‘independently’ and through sales of his work. He denied that choosing oil barrels to build the structure was a comment on the region’s chief source of wealth and stressed that his idea was not born out of economic or political events, just ‘joy and beauty.’ Location: The Mastaba will be situated here, with the yellow and red colours of the sands said to have inspired Christo in his design . Plans: The Mastaba is slightly taller than the Great Pyramid of Gaza in Egypt. Christo and the project's backers hope it will attract two million visitors a year . Flat-topped pyramid: Another design sketch as the Mastaba takes shape . Site: The Mastaba will be constructed in the south-east of the country, 100 miles from Abu Dhabi and close to the border with Oman . It has been inspired by Islamic architecture, with Christo saying: ‘When Louis XIV was building that kitschy castle Versailles, the greatest architecture in the Middle East had incredible simplicity… and play with colours.’ Construction of the Mastaba will take 30 months, with hundreds of people involved. A German company has been commissioned to supply the coloured barrels. A nearby ‘art campus’ will include an exhibition on the project, as well as housing a luxury hotel and restaurant. Christo, born Christo Javacheff, is best known for wrapping everyday items including bottles and chairs in sheets or tarpaulin. Scouting locations: Christo and his wife Jeanne-Claude, who died in 2009, look at possible locations for the sculpture on a visit to the UAE in 2007 . Long time coming: Christo and Jeanne-Claude scouting for possible sites in February 1982 . He famously wrapped the Reichstag, the German government building in Berlin, and the Pont-Neuf Bridge in Paris in fabric. His ‘Umbrellas’ project, between 1984 and 1991, involved setting up 3,000 umbrellas along highways in Japan and the United States. Surrounded Islands, 1983 . A two week installation in Biscayne Bay, Miami to surround 11 islands with 1.98m square feet of pink floating plastic. The luminous pink colour of the fabric proved a great hit with everyone who could see it from the surrounding islands, beaches and causeways. In total, 430 workers fitted the 11km of plastic and 120 monitors watched it day and night. Pretty in pink: The 1983 Surrounding Islands project in Miami involved 11km of pink plastic sheeting . Pont Neuf, Paris (1985)After nine years of negotiations with the then mayor of Paris, Jacques Chirac, Christo received permission to 'wrap' one of the most picturesque bridges in the French capital. It needed 130,000 square feet of sand-coloured fabric to cover and took just under a month to complete. Three million people came to have a look in the ensuing two weeks. The Umbrellas, Japan and California (1984-1991) The plans was to line highways in California and Japan with yellow and blue umbrellas respectively at the same time. Two thousand workers were brought in during September 1991 to install the umbrellas into their reinforced metal bases at a cost of £16m. By September 7, 1991, there were 1,340 blue umbrellas in Ibaraki, Japan and 1,760 yellow umbrellas at the Tejon Ranch in southern California. Three million people saw the six-metre high installations and became a huge tourist attraction. On October 26, 1991, one of the umbrellas broke loose in high winds, killing one woman and injuring several others. The installation was immediately closed. Cloaked: Christo's most famous work, covering the Reichstag in Berlin in white fabric in 1995 . The Reichstag, Berlin (1995)His best known project, Christo and wife Jeanne-Claude wrapped the German parliament building in fabric in the summer of 1995, attracting five million visitors. They sought the support of the President of the Parliament, Rita Sussmuth, and all 662 delegates of the Bundestag by writing and phoning them. They received permission following a 70-minute debate in the parliament on February 25, 1995.

"Police were accused last night of behaving like ‘thugs with weapons’ after firing a 50,000-volt Taser into the back of a blind man. An officer mistook stroke victim Colin Farmer’s white stick for a samurai sword and discharged the stun gun – leaving the retired architect writhing in agony on the ground. No disciplinary action is  being taken against the officer. The extraordinary blunder is the latest illustration of the soaring number of controversial incidents with the weapons, which can be fatal. 'Terrified': Blind pensioner Colin Farmer, 61, was set upon in Chorley, Lancashire after a police officer mistook his cane for a samurai sword . Mr Farmer, 61, said yesterday he ‘thought he was being killed’ by the stun gun before being handcuffed as he lay face down on the ground. He added that the officer who discharged the device should be ‘sacked, charged and locked up’. Former home secretary David Blunkett, who is himself blind, said last night: ‘I am as stunned as Colin Farmer must have been by the Taser itself. After the Paralympics I genuinely hoped we’d made some progress.’ 'Trapped in a nightmare': Mr Farmer said he feared he would suffer another stroke when he was hit with the Taser in Chorley, Lancashire (file photo) Kevin Lonergan, of the Galloway’s Society for the Blind charity, said: ‘I know Colin personally and he wouldn’t hurt a fly. How could you mistake a white walking stick for a samurai sword? I am shocked and disappointed at the police.’ Last year in the UK, Tasers were fired by police into suspects at least 1,081 times, compared with 744 in 2010 – a 45 per cent rise. In June the Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, wrote to the Prime Minister to demand that every front-line officer have access to a Taser. There are currently 12,000 Tasers on our streets but under the Federation plans that number would be increased to 36,000. Mr Farmer’s ordeal began at 5.45pm last Friday when he was walking down an alleyway to meet friends at a pub in Chorley, Lancashire. Officers had received reports of a man roaming around a town centre armed with a large sword. Minutes later, they swooped on Mr Farmer, wrongly assuming he was the swordsman. The unnamed officer claimed he shouted for Mr Farmer to stop but when he carried on walking, opened fire only to realise his mistake. Innocent: Blind Mr Farmer was walking along Peter Street to meet his friends in a pub when the officer swooped . The real thing: A samurai sword of the type that Mr Farmer's stick was mistaken for by a police officer . Mr Farmer, who is now pursuing legal . action against Lancashire Constabulary, was taken to hospital before . being released. Police later arrested a 27-year old man believed to be . the real offender but he was released without charge after no weapon was . found. Mr Farmer, who has five sons and two . grandchildren, said: ‘I was slowly making my way down the street when I . heard this man shouting. I had no idea it was directed at me and I just . kept thinking, “I’ve got to get out of here” because I thought they were . hooligans trying to mug me. I was terrified. Worried: Mr Farmer, a retired company director, thought he was being attacked by hooligans when he was hit with the weapon by the officer . ‘But suddenly I felt a huge force on . my back and this electric shock went right through my body. I thought I . was being killed. My muscles just went and I dropped my walking stick . and collapsed on to the floor. I thought I was having another stroke. ‘It was like being hit by lightning. I dropped to the floor with my cane and I was shouting all the time, “I’m blind! I’m blind!” After Mr Farmer fell to the floor face down, the police officer knelt on his back before handcuffing him. Mr Farmer said: ‘I told him he was . hurting me but he wasn’t listening. He used such force when he put the . handcuffs on that he broke a small bracelet which was a family heirloom . belonging to my grandfather. ‘He was not an officer of the law; he was an absolute thug with a licence to carry a dangerous weapon.’ Mr Farmer was left blind following a stroke in 2008 which left him partially paralysed down one side. He suffered a second stroke following a brain haemorrhage in March this year. He said a second officer admitted there had been a case of mistaken identity and apologised. But he added: ‘It was obvious that I was blind and did not pose a threat to anyone. I walk at a snail’s pace and they could have asked me to stop but this officer was on a mission to use that gun no matter what.’ A police officer holding a Taser stun gun during a training exercise (file photo) Chief Superintendent Stuart Williams, . of Lancashire Constabulary, said the incident had been referred to the . IPCC and the officer who fired the Taser had not been suspended. Tasers were introduced to give officers an option between firearms and other weapons such as batons and CS gas . They have been discharged in more than 6,200 confrontations across England and Wales since they were introduced in 2004 . Police . use a U.S. manufactured £500 X26 model which fires a 50,000-volt charge . into the victim via two barbs attached to thin metal wires . It has a range of 21ft and causes muscles to twitch uncontrollably . He added: ‘We deeply regret what has . happened. We have clearly put this man through a traumatic experience . and we are extremely sorry. ‘We have launched an urgent investigation to understand what lessons can be learned.’ The use of Tasers by the Lancashire force has risen by 80 per cent in a year. Last year they were fired 73 times. In the past, critics including Amnesty International have said Tasers, which were introduced in the UK in 2004, should be used only by highly trained officers where there is a threat to life or of serious injury. Tasers, which are described as a ‘less-lethal’ alternative to firearms, cause temporary paralysis by firing a 50,000-volt charge into the victim via two barbs attached to thin metal wires which have a 21ft range. Solicitor Sophie Khan, who has represented several people injured by stun guns, said: ‘This officer was obviously trigger-happy as he shot a blind man in the back. This highlights once again that we have too many officers who are not properly trained to use these weapons and are harming innocent individuals with them. Something needs to change urgently.","Retired company director Colin Farmer, 61, was shot as he walked to meet friends in Chorley, Lancashire .

"The carcass of a beaked whale has been found on a Cornish beach – only the second time the species has been recorded in the UK. The Blainville’s whale, usually found in temperate and tropical waters, was discovered stranded on Kenneggy Beach, near Praa Sands. A member of the public reported it to the Cornwall Wildlife Trust as a porpoise, but experts confirmed it as a rare Blainville’s beaked whale. Scroll down for video . Marine Stranding Network undated handout photo of one of their volunteers with a dead Blainville's whale that was found on Kenneggy Beach, near Praa Sands, Cornwall .

Niki Clear, received photographs of the animal, measuring 3.8m (12ft . 5in) long, she recognised it as an elusive Blainville. Cetacean . experts Colin MacLeod at Aberdeen University and Richard C. Sabin from . The Natural History Museum later confirmed its identity. The 3.8 meter long whale was reported to the Cornwall Wildlife Trust Marine Strandings Network as a porpoise, but when the Network's data officer received photos of the animal she was suspicious that it was in fact a whale only recorded twice in the whole of the UK . Abby Crosby, . Marine Conservation Officer for Cornwall Wildlife Trust, said: 'We're . very pleased that people took the trouble to report this animal to us, . as by recording the carcasses of these creatures marine biologists can . gather information about the species to help towards their conservation. 'This carcass was in a poor condition with advanced decomposition, . so we would suggest that the public do not touch any dead marine animals . they find, as they can carry diseases that humans can catch. 'It was . a sad end for this amazing whale. However by examining these strandings . it at least gives us a chance to investigate these animals properly and . learn more about them.

Blainville's, like . most beaked whales, are mostly found off-shore in waters 200m (656ft) to 1,000m (3,280ft) along continental shelves.

"Victim: Henry Miller, 19, died after taking 'Yage' in a remote part of Colombia . The body of a British teenager on a gap year has been found dumped on a remote road in the Colombian jungle after taking the hallucinogenic drug Yage. Henry Miller, 19, who was due to go to university in September, had travelled to a remote rainforest area in the long-troubled South American country and taken the substance, which induces vivid hallucinations and supposedly spiritual experiences. His family, who live in a £450,000 Victorian terraced house in Bristol, released a photo of him today while trying to come to terms with his death. Elizabeth and David, and brother Freddie, said . today Henry had reacted to the plant infusion after the hostel he was . staying at recommended he drink it. In . a statement they said: 'In the last 48 hours we received the . exceptionally sad news that our son Henry has died whilst travelling in . Colombia. 'We are being informed of the circumstances through the Foreign Office. 'We understand that he took part in a local tribal ritual recommended by the hostel that he was staying at. 'The ritual involves a drink made from local plant infusions. We are awaiting further information from the Foreign Office but it is likely that a reaction to this drink was the cause. 'Henry was an adventurous person who travelled extensively. He was polite, popular with a great sense of humour and was very much loved by his family and his many friends. 'We hope we can all be given the time and space to come to terms with what has happened and to grieve for our son and brother.' A Twitter user also paid tribute to the student. She posted: 'So sad. RIP Henry you amazing guy.' Many of his friends changed their profile pictures on Facebook to one of them with Henry. It is thought he attended North Bristol Post 16 Centre . and had accepted a place at the University of Brighton to study at the school . of English Literature, Language, Linguistics & Media. After trying the drug for the first time, the student decided to stay at the hostel to take it again and collapsed on the second occasion. Hours later Henry's body was dumped on a remote dirt track. Scroll down for video . Tributes: Henry's family described him as 'popular' and 'polite' 'Popular': The student from Bristol was due to go to university in September after his travels . Education: He attended the North Bristol Post Centre and is believed to have accepted a place at the University of Brighton . Destination: The drug is found in the Andes in Southern Colombia . Colombian . police are now investigating the death, and the people who supplied . Henry with Yage, which was said by one local to kill a couple of people . every year. Henry, . from Bristol, had been travelling round South America for some months, . but only recently arrived in the remote town of Mocoa in the Putumayo . region. Around a week ago he booked in to the Casa del Rio hostel there. The hostel continues to list the taking of the potentially lethal hallucinogen on its 'things to do' web page, saying: 'experience Yagé, Indian tradition taking a medicinal plant which purifies and can make you hallucinate'. However the owners maintain that they did not encourage Henry to take the drug. Ayahuasca, or Yage, contains Dimethyltryptamine, or DMT. It is a plant-based mixture that can also be smoked to give users a hallucinatory 'journey' more extreme than that of LSD, ketamine or magic mushrooms. Adam Winstock, founder of the Global Drugs Survey, claims it has 'a larger proportion of new users' compared to other powerful drugs. According to the 2012 study, conducted between November and December last year, DMT offers an 'extreme hallucinatory experience' and users cite a 'bad trip' as a potential risk. The . majority of users rated the effect of DMT as stronger than ketamine, . magic mushrooms and LSD . They added that the reaction was a 'journey' rather than a trip because the experience stands . apart from anything else. The young Briton, who appears to have been travelling alone but had made friends on his travels, first drank the drug on Sunday without suffering apparent harm, then took it again on Tuesday. Henry travelled a short distance from his hostel to take the drug on the land of a shaman named as Guillemo Mavisoy Mutumbajoy from the Kamentsa tribe, among a small group of other tourists from around the world. There was one local report that Henry fell unconscious at around 3am on Wednesday morning, and that attempts were made to revive him with a nettle ointment said to be an antidote to Yage. One source was reported as telling a local Colombian news site: 'A couple of people die every year from taking Yage. I can't say very much as there is a police investigation. 'Henry was a very decent polite young man who looked more like a student than a hippy. He was not the sort of person you would expect that would take Yage.' The source added that Miller, who was travelling alone but had met others on his south American journey, may have been talked into taking the potentially lethal herbal cocktail. He revealed that Miller took part in the drug taking ritual twice while he was in Mocoa, with just one day between sessions, and 'was planning to travel on but changed his mind to go and take it again'. The process is said to take around 24 hours, and involves a number of processes which require the user to dress in white. Investigators from the Colombian Attorney General's Office removed the body to Mocoa to establish the cause of death. A UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesperson said: 'We are aware of the death of a British national on 23 April in Colombia. We are providing consular assistance to the family at this difficult time.'

"A Bradford housewife has claimed she spent five years as a child being raised by monkeys in the Colombian jungle. Marina Chapman said she was kidnapped for ransom in the 1950s when she was just five years old and abandoned in the jungle, with her captors believed to have botched the abduction. For five years, she lived a Tarzan-style existence with a colony of Capuchin monkeys - learning to catch prey, including birds and rabbits, with nothing but her bare hands. Her daughter Vanessa James told The Sunday Times: 'She obviously learnt to fend for herself and only once got very ill when she ate some poisonous berries.' Chapman's life in the jungle was said to have ended when she was discovered by hunters and sold to a brothel in the northern city of Cucuta, where she was regularly beaten. She escaped and was taken in by a Colombian family as a teenager, choosing the name Marina Luz. When Chapman was in her twenties, she travelled to the UK with her neighbours - who worked in the textile trade - and remained in the country after meeting her future husband John Chapman. The couple have two children and live in Yorkshire. Chapman, who says she never cries, only told her husband, a former church organist and bacteriologist, about her bizarre claims after they were married. Furry friend: The Capuchin monkey (stock image) variety which Chapman lived with for five years . King of swingers: Miles O'Keefe and Bo Derek in the 1981 film, Tarzan The Ape Man . James added: 'When we wanted food, we had to make noises for it. All my school friends loved Mum as she was so unusual. She was childlike, too, in many ways. 'I got bedtime stories about the jungle, as did my sisters. We didn't think it odd - it was just Mum telling her life. So in a way it was nothing special having a mother like that.' James is helping her mother write a book - The Girl With No Name, which is due to be published in April - about her experiences, while Blink Films is planning to make a television documentary about her childhood. Monkeys are known for accepting humans into the fold, according to experts on feral children. Ugandan orphan, John Ssebunya, lived for more than a year with monkeys at the age of four and adapted well to life with humans after he was rescued more than 20 years ago.

This diagram details the different features of the SeaOrbiter vessel. It has a platform lift for divers on the left-hand side, while stern thrusters power the ship. Bunks for the crew as well as the VIP cabin and Captain's room are on the right-hand side. The retractable keel weighs 180 tonnes . French architect Jacques Rougerie designed the incredible structure. A countdown on the SeaOrbiter site claims construction will start in 201 days, which would make the start 31 May 2014. The project will cost $52.7 million and has support from Nasa and the European Space Agency because the conditions on the SeaOrbiter are similar to those found in space. The 1,000 tonne vessel is 170ft tall but almost two thirds of this will be underwater, . Between 18 and 22 marine biologists will live on the hybrid boat laboratory. It will be the only vessel allowing 24-hour exploration. Between 18 and 22 marine biologists will be able to live on board the vessel at any one time because it has living quarters and kitchens. The laboratory part of the 1,000-tonne ship will sit below the surface to make the SeaOrbiter buoyant, but to also give a direct line of sight and access into the ocean to depths of up to 6,000 metres. According to Rougerie, the SeaOrbiter will additionally feature a ‘fish-collection system for studies of the pelagic ecosystem, plankton biodiversity, and fish stocks.’ Architect Rougerie developed the concept of the ocean lab around 12 years ago. He built his first underwater house on 4 August 1977. In 1981 he launched the Hippocampe, a scientific base suspended in mid-water that slept two people. The Hippocampe was capable of diving to depths of around 12 metres and could stay underwater for between seven and 15 days at a time. Called SeaOrbiter, the 1,000-tonne floating aquatic lab, pictured, was designed by French architect Jacques Rougerie. Construction on the ship is due to start in May 2014.

The French-designed ship will be able to explore depths of around 6,000 metres. Between 18 and 22 marine biologists will live on board at any one time because it has living quarters and kitchens . This is how the SeaOrbiter is expected to look from the ocean floor. The laboratory part of the ship, pictured, will sit below the surface to make the SeaOrbiter buoyant, but to also give a direct line of sight and access into the ocean . It is also environmentally friendly and sustainable because it is powered using solar, wind and wave energy. Although the SeaOrbiter has been designed to drift with ocean currents, the European Defense and Space systems (EADS) is also said to be developing a biofuel that could be used as a secondary power source. Previously Rougerie told Inhabitat that the SeaOrbiter: ‘would become an essential tool in exploring the world’s oceans and an useful base to study the link between global warming and the oceans, which absorb about a quarter of all carbon emissions.’ The SeaOrbiter vessel, pictured, will be powered by wind, wave and solar energy.

"A Muslim father has removed his six-year-old daughter from school in protest at her teacher who confiscated her Islamic necklace. Muhammed Tariq, 34, said his daughter Saniya was upset after a teacher took away her religious locket because she was swinging it around in class. The Year 2 pupil was told to take off her taweez - a chain containing verses from the Koran - after she was caught playing with it at Nottingham Academy last Monday. Muhammed Tariq has taken Saniya, six, out of school after her sacred taweez was confiscated by teachers . As a result, Britain’s biggest school have now made a U-turn on their uniform policy, which dictates pupils can only wear one plain pair of metal studs, and say she can now wear the jewellery in class. However, Mr Tariq has still pulled his daughter out of lessons for over a week after he branded the teacher’s actions an 'insult to Islam.' He is now demanding that she be placed in a different class away from the teacher who banned her 'sacred' locket. Yesterday Mr Tariq said: 'My daughter was really upset about it when she came home - she was in floods of tears. 'This is very sacred to her and to our religion. It should not be taken off Muslims and it is something she holds very dear indeed. 'To have it taken off her for the entire day and be shouted at by her teacher like that is an insult to our religion. Nottingham Academy has since changed its jewellery policy and said the child can wear the necklace . The row began when a teacher confiscated Saniya's taweez - a chain containing verses from the Koran . 'She said she had only been itching her neck and had got the taweez out to scratch her neck. 'But the teacher thought she was playing with it and swinging it about. 'The whole thing really upset her and I don’t think she is happy in the class any more. 'I think it will be better if she moves to a different class so I have taken her out of school until we can get this issue resolved. The academy has now agreed that Saniya can wear the item on religious grounds - except in PE and swimming. Saniya, who lives with her parents in Bakersfield, Nottinghamshire, said: 'I wear it every day. 'My taweez means a lot to me and I think she should have asked my parents before making me take it off.' Saniya said she was very upset when the teacher took away her taweez . Headteacher Steve Jones said: 'After speaking to Mr Tariq about his daughter, we decided Saniya could keep her necklace on in school, under her polo shirt, apart from the PE and swimming lessons. 'We would always consider exemptions on the basis of religious principles. 'Indeed, in Saniya’s case, we were able to reach a compromise with Mr Tariq.' Yesterday other parents gathered at the school gates gave mixed opinions on the incident. One mum, whose son goes to the school, but did not wish to be named, accused the head of caving in and bending the rules. She said: 'It is ridiculous that they felt threatened enough to change the rules like this. 'If it was a lad with a Christian cross and he was messing with it then I am almost certain the rules wouldn’t have been bent to let him wear it. 'At the end of the day if the girl is messing with the chain and it is distracting her or others from working then that’s why the rules are there.' Another father said: 'I agree it was wrong as it does mean that much to them as a religion. 'However, they have said she can wear it in class now - so surely that should be the problem resolved.' Nottingham Academy is the largest school in the UK and can cater for up to 3,600 pupils aged between three and 19-years-old. The academy is split over three sites in Nottingham and is sponsored by the Greenwood Dale Foundation Trust (GDFT) - which is now the sponsor of 21 Academies.","Muhammed Tariq said Saniya was upset after necklace was taken away .

"Tragic: Ramana Gadiraju, 50, pictured, and his female passenger Shubhada Kulkarni, 49, both of Lower Gwynedd, died when they hit a double decker tour boat . A Pennsylvania couple who were on vacation in Florida have been killed in a horrifying accident after their jet-ski slammed into a tour boat. Ramana Gadiraju, 50, and his female passenger Shubhada Kulkarni, 49, both of Lower Gwynedd, died when they hit a double decker tour boat taking tourists on a dolphin sightseeing cruise at around 6:10 p.m. Saturday. The couple have a son at college. Witnesses told officials the victims were racing with another jet ski which narrowly avoided hitting the tour boat. Some suggested the two jet-skis were involved in a game of 'chicken' though authorities have not confirmed this. The captain of the boat said he cut his engine after spotting the jet-skis, but could not avoid a collision. The 10-foot water scooter was traveling south in the Clearwater channel while the 59-foot tour boat was traveling north, authorities said, and the jet-ski struck the 'dead center front' of the boat. The captain retrieved the victims from the water and attempted CPR, but they were later pronounced dead by paramedics. None of the 70 to 80 passengers aboard the tour boat, run by Tropics Boat Tours, were injured. The accident took place near the Clearwater Memorial Causeway bridge in Clearwater. Accident: A couple in Florida died yesterday after their jet-ski collided with a tourist boat and authorities believe a game of chicken with another jet-skier caused the accident . Many of the tourists on board the boat were left shaken after the accident. Tour boat owner Trisha Rodriguez was in tears as she left the boat. 'Our thoughts and our prayers are with the family affected by this tragic accident,' she said. 'This has never happened to us before. It's a tragedy.' On its Facebook page on Sunday, the tour company said it 'extends ...heartfelt thoughts and prayers to all the family members, passengers and crew affected by the tragic accident that occurred yesterday.' Rodriguez said all the Tropics Boat Tours cruises on Sunday were canceled out of respect to the deceased. Tragic: The jet-skiers collided with a dolphin sightseeing tour boat in Clearwater, Florida . Wildlife commission spokesman Baryl Martin said authorities were continuing their investigation. 'There's no determination of fault until the investigation is complete,' he told the Tampa Bay Times. Martin added the incident should remind everyone of the hazards of personal watercraft. It is the second fatal accident this month involving a water scooter in the area. Katie Yale, 15, of Seminole died after a Labor Day collision between the inner tube she was riding on Lake Seminole and a personal watercraft. And in March last year Victor Vazquez, 40, of Indian Rocks Beach died after the personal watercraft he was riding struck a channel marker in the Intracoastal Waterway in Indian Rocks Beach. Vazquez was a passenger. The driver, Robert Turnbull, 35, of Indian Rocks Beach, was intoxicated, authorities said, and was charged with boating under the influence, manslaughter and vessel homicide.","Ramana Gadiraju, 50, and his female passenger Shubhada Kulkarni, 49, both of Lower Gwynedd, Pennsylvania died when they hit a tour boat .

"A girl's childhood dream of becoming a pro-fish-ional mermaid is going swimmingly - after completing fish school. Andrea Liguori, 19, attended mermaid school as a child where she learned to swim using a prosthetic tail and how to perform stunning tricks. The underwater obsessive became hooked on the legendary aquatic creatures after watching a performance of The Little Mermaid aged just three. Andrea Liguori, 19, from Florida got hooked on the legendary aquatic creatures after watching a performance of The Little Mermaid aged just three . Andrea Ligouri, pictured left in a mermaid costume aged 5, attended mermaid school as a child where she learned to swim using a prosthetic tail and how to perform stunning tricks . She would beg her parents to drive her from their Hernando Beach home in Florida, USA, to the tiny city of Weeki Wachee - where professional female divers have performed as mermaids since 1947. Weeki Wachee - dubbed 'The Only City of Live Mermaids' - is one of the smallest cities in the US with a population of nine but would regularly draw up to one million tourists per year at its peak in the 1960s. Andrea and her family visited the park so often that she was able to learn every routine by heart. After turning eight she was finally old enough to experience life as a mermaid and began attending mermaid school at Weeki Wachee. Andrea is now fulfilling her dream of being a professional mermaid at Weeki Wachee - dubbed 'The Only City of Live Mermaids' She said: 'I'd wanted to be a mermaid from the first time I saw the show at Weeki Wachee - they looked so graceful and magical. 'Mermaid school was an experience of a lifetime. I got to wear a tail, swim in the spring and meet the mermaids - it was everything I expected and more.' Andrea enjoyed the experience so much that she attended the school multiple times over the next few years until a position opened up to become a full time mermaid - the chance to fulfill her dream. After a successful interview and trial show the brunette beauty was offered the job ahead of around 50 other applicants - and now performs for tourists from all over the world.

"A British trawler captain has been fined . £22,000 and banned from fishing for a year after being found guilty in a French court of . switching-off his ship's locater beacon and illegally poaching scallops off the Normandy coast. Andrew Nicholson, 51, from Dumfries in Scotland was stopped by the French Navy in . September and ordered to return 14 tons of . scallops to the sea which he had collected from the Bay of the Seine . near Le Havre. His dredger Mattanja, which is owned by . TN trawlers based in Annan,Scotland, was . escorted to Ouistreham . on the Normandy coast and a judge ordered the owners to pay a massive . £120,000 bail before it was allowed to sail out of the port. A British trawler captain (not pictured) has been fined . £22,000 and banned from fishing for a year after being found guilty of . switching-off his ship's identification beacon and illegally poaching . French scallops . The court in Caen heard that an . inspection of the Mattanja's instruments found that the transponder which records the exact positions of a . vessel over a given period of time had been switched off. In court the Mattanja was referred to as an 'invisible ghost vessel' on the day in question. Nicholson was charged by the French prosecutor of poaching shellfish inside the French 12 mile limit. He was . fined £18,000 and ordered to . pay another £4,000 to the Norman fishermens' association. The victory in one their own courts . yesterday has raised fear that militant fishermen on the French side of . the Channel desperate to protect their stocks of the lucrative shellfish . delicacy may well launch another direct attack on individual British . trawlers fishing just outside sea limits. In October they launched a flotilla of . boats and terrorised the crew of a UK trawler , hurling rocks and iron . bars at them and accusing them of poaching in their waters . Rude: . French fisherman seen offering rude hand gestures and burning England . rugby shirts during a dispute over scallop fishing areas . The skipper of one UK trawler called for protection by the Royal Navy after a violent clash with the French. The Van Dijck is registered in Brixham, Devon, and owned by Englishman Andrew McLeod. In October Mr McLeod said the Royal . Navy should be used to protect fishermen from further attacks by the . French.Mr McLeod said: 'Protection from the Royal Navy is something . we've been asking for for some time.' The Royal Navy was deployed to protect British fishermen during the Cod Wars with Iceland in  the 1970s. In 1972, Iceland had declared an Exclusive Economic Zone beyond its own territorial waters while announcing plans to reduce over-fishing. This led to the Icelandic Coastguard cutting the nets of British trawlers that fished in the area. The UK retaliated by deploying Royal Navy warships to protect British fishing crews. There followed a number of stand-offs between UK and Icelandic vessels, which included them ramming each other. The lengthy dispute finally  ended in 1976 when Iceland threatened to close a vital Nato base in retaliation for the deployment  of the Navy. The British Government conceded that UK vessels would no longer fish within the disputed 200- nautical-mile limit. He . said the British had been in negotiations with the French over access . to the rich scallop beds 15 miles off the coast of Caen. The Van Dijck’s crew painted Union Jack on the boat’s side, and pledged to resist efforts by the French to intimidate them. The judge's guilty verdict on Mr Nicholson today was welcomed by the Normandy fisherman's association. President Paul Francoise said that the . case of the Mattanja had been a blatant case of deliberate poaching. 'He knew perfectly well that he was fishing inside the twelve mile . territorial limit and he tried to escape notice by switching off his . transponder', he said. His association asked the judge to . impose a 26 thousand euro indemnity but only four thousand euros were . awarded as 'material loss' by the French fishing industry had not been . proved, only 'moral prejudice'. Mr Francoise claims that EU . regulations which allow British trawlers to fish for scallops in larger . quantities and for longer periods off the French coast give them an . unfair advantage over their French counterparts. 'Even if the British stay outside the . French limits they are still pillaging the stocks which our fishermen . have taken pains to build up over the years and which they are forced to . see disappearing over the Channel to UK processing factories. 'What really angers us is to see . French scallops caught by the Brits in French waters and then taken to . the UK to be processed and then returned to French supermarkets in . plastic bags to be sold in France'. Frustration: Angry French protestors have called on EU authorities to impose a temporary ban . on fishing for scallops claiming that overfishing had reduced sizes of . shellfish and catches . Anger: French trawlers confront the larger British trawler, in the centre of the picture,  during the standoff . Mr Francoise admitted that part of the . French problem is that local fishermen have failed to set up local . factories and modernise their industry, preferring to sell scallops in . their natural state to housewives at markets. In the case of another UK scallop . dredger arrested this month in the same sea area Mr Francoise said his . association would be demanding 'much compensation as the skipper may . well have just made a mistake' over his position due to a miscalculation . . The Van Dijck, which was victim of a . violent attack by Norman trawlermen in October, was hauled into . Ouistreham by the French Navy earlier this month after being ordered to . return seventeen tons of scallops to the sea. Tension: The French trawlers confronted the British following a dispute over fishing for scallops. This image shows a British trawler with catch of scallops .

"No one expected this. Less than a week after he lifted the World Cup trophy in Rio de Janeiro, Germany captain Phillipp Lahm has retired from international football. Yes, there had been the odd report prior to the World Cup. Lahm himself had admitted in February that he would not rule it out as a possibility. But it didn’t seem like a real consideration. Few believed him. Many still didn’t believe it as Bild reported the story on Friday morning. It wouldn’t have been the first time that the newspaper’s anonymous sources had been mistaken. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Germany captain Lahm retires from international football . Out with a bang: Philipp Lahm (centre) has retired from international football after winning the World Cup . Champions!  Lahm with the trophy in Rio (left) and at Germany's victory parade in Berlin (right) But by mid morning, Lahm’s agent had confirmed the rumour. The Bayern player was stepping down from international duties with immediate effect. 'It is the right time for me to go,' said Lahm. With 30 years and 113 caps, Lahm is certainly not leaving in his prime. His departure will nonetheless be a hammer blow for Germany. Throughout the tournament in Brazil, he proved himself not only to be one of the most tactically intelligent and diverse players on the planet, but also a worthy leader. He had to fight for that accolade, with many questioning his strength and leadership qualities along the way. Others saw him as a little too arrogant. When he officially inherited the captaincy from Michael Ballack in 2010, many were unhappy with the manner in which he did so. Since then, though, Lahm has proved time and again that he is the perfect leader for this team. He was quiet but confident, leading his team by example, whether playing at left back, right back or in central midfield. Captain fantastic: Lahm played in midfield and at right back as Germany won the World Cup . Winner: Mario Gotze grabbed the only goal of the World Cup final in extra time against Argentina . He has been greeted with overwhelming praise, with compliments from Lukas Podolski, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and even Chancellor Angela Merkel. 'I would like to articulate my huge respect for Philipp Lahm and what he was done for our national team,' said Merkel. His critics will no doubt see the same old arrogance in his decision to step down now, just days after his finest hour. Bild claimed that Lahm was 'quitting while he is ahead', while TZ mused that he is a 'perfectionist'. But this decision was not a spontaneous act of vanity. The decision was allegedly made in the autumn of last year, and he informed coach Joachim Low of his plan the morning after the World Cup Final. Wolfgang Niersbach, president of the German FA, said that 'it was clear within minutes of speaking to Phillipp that there was no way I was going to talk him out of it'. Like his football, Lahm's decision was considered and confident. Where it all began: Lahm made his debut for Germany in a 2-1 win over Croatia in 2004 . Dejected: Lahm was part of the Germany side that lost to Spain in the Euro 2008 final . There are also footballing reasons to step down. The move into midfield is something which has seen less success for Germany than it has for Bayern Munich. At 30, he can no longer make the marauding runs up and down the right that he used to. For the national team, though, he is still more of a right back than a midfielder. Lahm is leaving the national team as world champions, with no shortage of defensive talent that can be raised to replace him over the next two years. He is also leaving them with a captain. Bastian Schweinsteiger has shown, not least in the World Cup Final, that he can lead this German side as much as anyone, and is almost certain to take over the armband. As Lahm himself said, ""I am leaving this team in complete harmony"". Lahm, meanwhile, will continue to play for Bayern at least until his contract runs out in 2018. Pep Guardiola rates him as the finest player he has ever coached, and will certainly not allow him to let up before then. Germany will survive without Lahm but he will leave a gap. As a leader and a footballer, Lahm was without doubt one of Germany’s finest captains. Playing on: Lahm will continue to play for his club side, German champions Bayern Munich .","Phillipp Lahm has retired from international football .

"Up to 15,000 immigrants are sneaking into Britain a year through Calais, the French town’s deputy mayor has claimed. Philippe Mignonet, who is also the port’s immigration chief, went public with the estimate because he said Calais was becoming a ‘magnet for illegal immigrants', with hundreds of foreigners sleeping rough there before stowing away aboard lorries and ferries. ‘According to our estimations, depending on the night, between 10, 20, even 40 are getting through,’ he said. The official's criticism of Britain came just days after French Interior Minister Manuel Valls called on the UK to change its immigration policy because of the pressure that Calais was under. Straight-talking: Calais deputy mayor Philippe Mignonet says the border should be taken to the UK so France doesn't have to deal with it . UK immigration officers checking vehicles headed for Britain via Calais - the port's mayor says the UK isn't doing enough to halt the tide of illegal immigrants . Crossing: Asylum seekers and migrants from around the world camp next to the Calais container port . Calais' mayor, Philippe Mignonet, accused 'hypocritical' Britain of talking tough on immigration but failing to act . Mr Mignonet said: ‘The ease with . which illegal immigrants can work on the black market in Britain, . coupled with the fact that migrants’ family members can more easily join . them, means that Britain is a magnet for illegal immigrants.’ It is far harder for newcomers to . claim benefits or get jobs in France, where the socialist government . regularly deports migrants, and destroys their illegal encampments. The UK Border Force shares . responsibility with the French for patrolling Calais, but Mr Mignonet . says the main controls should be transferred to the south coast of . England to deal with what is principally ‘a British problem’. He told the Daily Telegraph: ‘The quickest, most radical . and easiest solution would be simply to shift the border from Calais to . Dover and Folkestone and then the problem wouldn’t be handled in France . but Britain.’ Mr Mignonet attacked ‘hypocritical’ Britain for talking tough on immigration, but then allowing hundreds of . thousands to stay, and said if this continued, France . would just ‘let them through’. He said Britain needed to do more to halt the tide of migrants heading there through Calais, and said Britain had a 'hypocritical' attitude, talking tough but doing little to actively discourage illegal immigrants. The deputy mayor also said that hundreds tried to slip through the border every night, with several of them evading border staff successfully, despite officers' best attempts. Pressure: The former dockers social club in Place de Norvege, Calais, France, has been turned into accommodation for migrants . Slipping through: M. Mignonet said that despite border officers' efforts, thousands got through each year . Stream of immigrants: Calais has been a bottleneck for would-be illegal immigrants to the UK for years . He said: ‘The quickest, most radical . and easiest solution would be simply to shift the border from Calais to . Dover and Folkstone. and then the problem wouldn’t be handled in France . but Britain.’ On Friday, Interior Minister Mr Valls said he sympathised with Calais’ plight. He criticised the ‘impasse’ in communication between British border authorities and their French counterparts in the English Channel port, and invited the Home Secretary, Theresa May, to visit the area to see the pressure on French border guards. The comments came days after French Interior Minister Manuel Valls (pictured) called on Britain to change its immigration policy because of the pressure the port is under . Speaking at the port, Mr Valls said: ‘We need full and complete cooperation between all parties. ‘We will also, no doubt, need to flesh out and renegotiate certain agreements, in order to reinforce France’s cooperation with Britain and Europe.’ ‘Our British friends must realise the burden, the weight, which is on France.’ The Home Office said the UK already has staff in France who are tasked with aiding their French colleagues in the battle to stop immigrants travelling illegally. The Sangatte camp, which was previously used to accommodate immigrants attempting to head to Britain, was closed in 2002 after riots. Under a deal set up concerning the camp’s operation, Britain pays a contribution towards the policing of the migrant problem in Calais. But the closure of Sangatte failed to stop migrants coming to Calais. According to French news wire service AFP up to 500 undocumented migrants currently live in semi-permanent camps in the port town. Last week the House of Commons public . accounts committee blamed staff shortages in the Border Force for . failures in checking lorries for stowaways. In turn, the Force insists that it is stopping thousands of people every year from illegally entering Britain from France. Calais became the focal point of cross-Channel immigration in the early 2000s when thousands of migrants used the Red Cross refugee camp at nearby Sangatte as a staging post on the journey to Britain. It was finally shut down in 2002 by the then Interior Minister, Nicolas Sarkozy, but there have been rumours that a similar facility is being built. This has been firmly denied by Calais mayor Natacha Bouchart who insists that a health centre is solely being offered to migrants sleeping rough in freezing winter temperatures. Victory: Sustained by the thought of a better life in Britain, migrants live in ramshackle camps around the port . Ms Bouchart has blamed Britain's benefits culture for attracting so many migrants to Calais, from where they hope to hitch a ride on lorry, bus, car or ferry. These migrants live on the outskirts of the town, thousands of them squashed sleeping in ramshackle camps where tents are patched up with bin-liners and people swarm for the hot food provided by volunteers each evening. Sustained only by the thought of the benefits and freedom they hope to be given in Britain, they come from Syria, Iraq, Palestine, Afghanistan and Somalia, among many other foreign countries, and fill their water bottles from taps and queue at food vans for hours. Waiting: Asylum seekers and migrants from countries include Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq and Pakistan head to Calais . The 'plague' of makeshift camps, as Ms Bouchart described it, is 'tarnishing the town's image', and keeps around 300 French volunteers busy round the clock handing out food, clothing and other essentials needed by the poverty-stricken refugees. The charity SALAM, which staffs the camps, says that the migrants are mostly young men who hope to make it across the Channel and claim asylum in Britain. Sometimes the camps are destroyed - in 2009 Sarkozy ordered the closure of the notorious Jungle camp - but the desperate migrants simply set up somewhere else.","Claims made by town's deputy mayor Phillipe Mignonet .

"Scroll down for video . A portable fertility test enabling men to test the quality of their sperm from the privacy of their own homes has been invented by scientists. Researchers in the US say their easy-to-use kit could be available to consumers as early as next year, meaning men focussed on their fertility issues would no longer have to endure frequent trips to the doctor to test their sperm. Greg Sommer and Ulrich Schaff, who founded a startup company to develop their device, say the tests can give a result within minutes. Scientists say they have invented a portable fertility test enabling men to test the quality of their sperm from the privacy of their own homes, without enduring frequent trips to a doctor . They are now working on a mobile app so that men can use their phones to study to results of the test, and learn how to discuss them with doctors. 'It allows men to test and track their fertility from the comfort and privacy of their own homes,' Mr Sommer told the Albuquerque Journal. 'It's a portable, easy-to-use diagnostic system with the accuracy of a clinical lab test.' The scientists came up with their idea while working at Sandia National Laboratories in California, where they created a device that quickly detects toxins or other biological threats in emergency first responders. Mr Sommer, who with his partner is now looking to market the device to consumers through a partnership with an established medical company, said that fertility solutions have traditionally been more focused on women . The pair then licensed the technology from Sandia, which formed the basis for their device, and in 2012, they founded Sandstone Diagnostics Inc., to develop the fertility-test kit, which they called TrakFertility.

"A patient has had to be cut free from his hospital bed in China and forcibly removed by police after chaining himself down and refusing to leave. A court in Beijing ordered that the man, aged 55 and only known by his surname Chen, had to be removed from the hospital after living there for more than three years. But when police turned up to at the hospital yesterday afternoon, they discovered that he had chained himself to the bed railings. Mr Chen is carried out of the Beijing Jingmei Group Hospital after being ordered to leave after spending more than three years there . Mr Chen, aged 55, had refused to leave the hospital and struggled with police officers that had come to take him home . Officers were then forced to cut the locks and remove a visibly distressed Mr Chen, who was still dressed in his hospital-issue pyjamas, and struggling with police. Mr Chen was first admitted to the Beijing Jingmei Group Hospital in August 2011 to receive treatment for injuries sustained in a road traffic accident. After being treated, he went home after a month but two months later returned complaining of pains in his left leg. Again doctors treated him after he was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis and three months later said he was ready to go home. Officers were also forced to cut Mr Chen free after he used padlocks to chain himself to his bed after the hospital won a court order . The 55-year-old was still wearing his hospital issue pyjamas and looked visibly upset after being removed from the facility . But Mr Chen refused, saying he was in so much pain that he was unable to straighten out his legs. He said it was the hospital's responsibility to take care of him and refused to leave, even missing his son's wedding. The hospital stopped providing him with treatment in July 2012, after he was unable to pay any of his medical bills. Mr Chen's family argue with police officers and court officials who came to remove him from the hospital to enforce a court order . He refused to leave his hospital bed saying he had pains in his left leg but the hospital stopped providing any treatment to him in July 2012 . The hospital were granted the order to remove Mr Chen after tests showed he was healthy. He disputed this and used the locks to chain himself to his bed . They were then granted a court ordered earlier in the week to have Mr Chen forcibly removed from his hospital bed. It came after tests were carried out that showed he was healthy, even though he disputed this. It is thought that he was taken back to his home in the Mentougou district of Beijing.","Man, known as Mr Chen, first went to the Beijing hospital in August 2011 .

"The BBC and BT Sport were quite the bosom buddies over the weekend. Not only did they begin to share the load in covering the BDO World Darts Championship from Lakeside. They also teamed up to deliver a wealth of live FA Cup third-round action. From Salford to Stratford, it was cuddles all around. Robbie Savage (left) commentates from the gantry position during the FA Cup match at Dover . Sunday was the big day for their coverage, delivering three games in a row. This was teed off on Saturday evening, at peak time no less, on BBC1 as the Pointless set was turfed over to delivered an FA Cup celebrity special. Now I'm not sure if host Alexander Armstrong was necessarily engrossed by the idea? Strikes me as more of a rugger man? But his 'pointless friend' Richard Osman certainly was. Wearing a Motty-style sheepskin and Fulham scarf, he was revelling in the opportunity to mix it with the likes of Trevor Sinclair, Jermaine Jenas and Mark Chapman. Although he saved his best for Robbie Savage, who he gave as good a kicking as the former Welsh midfielder had ever dished out on the field of play. But Robbie was clearly up for the challenge. Alan Shearer, Jimmy Bullard and Gary Lineker in the studio for Arsenal's match at the Emirates . And when he identified Alfred Hitchcock as a famous West Ham fan, the blonde bombshell jumped around the set like he'd just scored the winner at Wembley. Gary Lineker, however, may not have been so chuffed. Even though he did get to read out a question from the Match of The Day set, he was surely just a little miffed when the likes of Dumbo, Spock and Van Gogh were answers in the category 'famous ears', but he wasn't? If Gary was disappointed, he wasn't letting it show when we next saw him at the Emirates to oversee the rematch of last year's Cup final between Arsenal and Hull City. Now earlier in the day, Jake Humphrey was boots on the ground, not afraid to get a little touchline on his loafers for BT's coverage of Manchester United's trip to Yeovil. This tactile approach is very much the house style, and it certainly helped underline the nature of Goliath's trip to David's back yard. The Emirates, though, is no Huish Park and Gary was warmly ensconced in a studio up in the stands with his guests Alan Shearer and Jimmy Bullard. Now I'm sure Gary and Al wouldn't have minded a bit of fresh air. But I don't think Jimmy would have been quite so keen. He came dressed as if he had just walked out of Stringfellows...in about 1989! The BT team of Jake Humphrey, ex-Yeovil player Adam Virgo, Owen Hargreaves and Steve McManaman . With his long hair gelled back, and sporting a black tuxedo jacket with a black silk shirt unbuttoned to reveal a silver necklace, I think it is safe to say that Jimmy has decided to make up for all that lost time he'd spent wearing a sweaty vest and shorts in the jungle. Like some kind of old football pros version of Zoolander, it would appear Robbie might have himself a rival on the pundit catwalk. Come Monday night, and I must confess to being somewhat surprised to see the Match of the Day team, once again, doing their thing from inside a studio at the ground. The 1988 Cup final rematch felt like the dream tie of the round. And the old Kingsmeadow stadium looked the ideal setting for Gary to go and get some grass on his Guccis? But perhaps it has just been decided by the powers-that-be that pitchside is just a bit too BT and ITV? Instead, it was down to Mark Chapman to get in amongst it. Accompanied by the panto-style cheers, boos, oohs and aahs of a group of watching Wimbledon fans, Chappers was in the club bar to bring us the fourth round. And some may say that's the first time those words have ever appeared alongside each other! Angel di Maria scores Manchester United's second goal against Yeovil Town . This was an intimate, down-to-earth, grass roots reminder of what is meant by the magic of the Cup. As indeed was a superb game of knockout football under the lights. In which a certain Steven Gerrard was the fundamental difference. A fact that wasn't wasted on Alan Shearer who chose the occasion to basically lay into Liverpool with as much venom as Osman had on Savage, on Saturday night. 'His head has not been turned by the lure of the MLS', snarled Shearer before the game. 'If they wanted him badly enough, they'd have kept him'. He then went on to hijack the post match analysis from a rather startled-looking Dave Beasant, to once again point out that the club had let their long-serving captain down. Anyone else get the feeling that Shearer reckons Liverpool's decision-making about Gerrard's future was pointless?

"Texas Gov. Rick Perry said Monday morning that it's a mistake to classify a recent beheading murder in Moore, Oklahoma as a case of workplace violence, since the alleged perpetrator was a radical Muslim who reportedly shouted Islamist slogans as he wielded his blade. 'At some point in time,' Perry said on the Fox News Channel, 'I think the [Obama] administration does have to address this as what it appears to many people that it is: an act of violence that is associated with terrorism.' But according to The Washington Post, the FBI has stuck the 'workplace violence' label on the case of Alton Nolen, a 30-year-old recent Muslim convert who police say decapitated one coworker and stabbed another shortly after he was fired from his job at a food processing plant. Texas Gov. Rick Perry said Monday that the Oklahoma beheading was a case that looked more like terrorism than 'workplace violence' Alton Nolen, the beheading suspect, is a recent Muslim convert with a long rap sheet who had already served at least two years in prison . Oklahoma beheading suspect Alton Nolen (right) calls himself 'Jah'Keem Yisrael' on his Facebook page; Army Maj. Nidal Hasan (left) was sentenced to death for killing 13 on a military base. Both cases are classified as 'workplace violence' His dismissal reportedly followed an argument among employees over whether strict followers of Islam are correct in calling for the stoning deaths of women who commit certain offenses. 'I think Americans aren't confused about this what this is,' Perry told the 'Fox and Friends' program. 'This is a clear case of an individual going in and doing something that doesn't meet their definition of workplace violence.' 'So you know,' Perry said, 'I think any rational thinking American is going to look at this and go, ""This is more than just normal workplace violence"".' The federal government still classifies the 2009 Fort Hood shooting in Texas as workplace violence as well. Critics have slammed authorities in Oklahoma for treating the beheading as 'workplace violence' rather than an act of terrorism. The Facebook page of suspect Alton Nolen has anti-American rants under the name 'Jah'Keem Israel' and he has also posted photos of Osama Bin Laden. It also shows a man with a quote: 'I will instill terror into the hearts of the unbelievers: smile ye above their necks and smite all their fingertips off them.' Police, however, are still classifying it as a 'workplace violence' incident. Colin Clarke, a Rand Corporation terrorism expert, told Fox & Friends Weekend on Saturday that the beheading was an act of terrorism and should be characterized that way. 'Calling it workplace violence is counterproductive,' he said. Chad Sweet, CEO of the Chertoff Group and a former Homeland Security Chief of Staff and CIA official, said: 'You'll see this change very shortly.' 'The only thing that is causing a pause, I think, is the fact that the triggering event was the termination of his employment.' Army Maj. Nidal Hasan, a psychiatrist who had the words 'Soldier of Allah' added to his official military business cards, killed 13 and injured 32 when he opened fire on his fellow servicemen and women. Last month Hasan wrote from his jail cell to the self-declared 'caliph' of ISIS, the terrorist Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham, asking to be granted citizenship. In 2013 he told a judge that he planned to defend himself at trial by arguing that he was acting 'in defense of others' with his killings. Asked who he was defending, Hasan told a judge it was the leadership of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, the Taliban and its leader Mullah Omar – since the Fort Hood troops were expected to deploy to Afghanistan soon after Hasan went on his murder spree. Hasan was convicted on 13 premeditated murder charges and 32 counts of attempted premeditated murder, and sentenced to death. Survivors of his attack have been denied Purple Heart Medals and other combat benefits because the government refuses to reclassify the shootings as terror-related. Nolen has served  prison sentences before, with concurrent two-year stays for marijuana possession, assaulting a highway patrol trooper,and cocaine possession. He was released years early following the recalculation of his sentence for good behavior behind bars. His mother released a Facebook video on Saturday in which she apologized to her son's victims but cautioned that  'there are two sides to every story.' Flags and crosses honored those killed and wounded in the 2009 'workplace violence' rampage of Maj. Hasan, whose business card read 'Soldier of Allah' Texas Gov. Rick Perry said Monday that the Oklahoma beheading was a case that looked more like terrorism than 'workplace violence' Emotional: Employees and friends waited for word about loved ones as police investigated the beheading on Thursday . 'My heart is just so heavy right now,' Joyce Nolen said in the video. 'That's not my son.' It emerged Monday that Mr. Nolen's beheading victim, 54-year-old Colleen Hufford, was a grandmother who had lost her home in a tornado. He was shot during his rampage  by a sheriff's deputy who also owned the food processing plant where he worked. But he regained consciousness by Saturday and law enforcement officers weer able to question him. Police Sgt. Jeremy Lewis said Nolen will be charged Monday with first-degree murder, and with assault and battery with a deadly weapon. He may also face federal charges.","Texas governor blasted the Obama administration for refusing to call beheading attack 'what it appears to many people that it is: an act of violence that is associated with terrorism'

"President Barack Obama told Americans on Tuesday that 2014 should be the year to finally close the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay as the United States winds down its military role in Afghanistan and shifts away from a ‘permanent war footing.’ In his annual State of the Union address, Mr Obama renewed his old vow - dating back to the start of his presidency five years ago - to shut the internationally condemned jail at the U.S. Naval Base in Cuba, and he called on Congress for further action to help him do so. ‘This needs to be the year Congress lifts the remaining restrictions on detainee transfers and we close the prison at Guantanamo Bay,’ he said. ‘Because we counter terrorism not just through intelligence and military action, but by remaining true to our constitutional ideals and setting an example for the rest of the world.’ Scroll down for video . I did it: U.S. President Barack Obama winks up at first lady Michelle Obama as he arrives to deliver his State of the Union speech . Barack Obama delivered his State of the Union address before a joint session of Congress, on Capitol Hill in Washington DC, on Tuesday . While seeking to add a sense of urgency to the issue, Mr Obama stopped short of offering any new prescriptions on how he intends to empty Guantanamo of its remaining 155 prisoners. They were rounded up overseas after the September 11, 2001, attacks and have been held without trial ever since. After U.S. lawmakers made it easier late last year to transfer Guantanamo inmates to their home countries, Mr Obama is now in a better position to gradually reduce the detainee population. But signaling that major obstacles remain, he said Congress needed to give him further flexibility. The effort to close Guantanamo is a critical part of the President's broader drive to roll back some of controversial aspects of the global fight against Islamist militants as he presses ahead with plans to formally end the long, unpopular war in Afghanistan by the end of the year. ‘Even as we actively and aggressively pursue terrorist networks,’ Mr Obama said, ‘America must move off a permanent war footing.’ In a speech that focused mostly on domestic issues, Mr Obama reminded Americans that he had already imposed ‘prudent limits’ on deadly U.S. drone strikes against Al Qaeda and its allies - a campaign that has drawn criticism for civilian casualties in countries such as Pakistan, Afghanistan and Yemen. ‘We will not be safer if people abroad believe we strike within their countries without regard for the consequence,’ he said. Detainees sit in a holding area watched by military police at Camp X-Ray inside Naval Base Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, during processing . Police escort a detainee to his cell at Guantanamo Bay, a detention facility Obama has vowed to shut down . He also reasserted the pledge he made earlier this month to reform U.S. surveillance activities. The move was triggered by former spy agency contractor Edward Snowden's revelations of the government's vast collection of phone data, including eavesdropping on some allied foreign leaders. Reaction from human rights groups was initially muted. ‘President Obama's legacy is at stake and his time is slipping away,’ said Zeke Johnson, director of Amnesty International USA's Security and Human Rights Program. ‘We've heard this before and now is the time for action, to finally transfer the 77 Guantanamo detainees cleared to leave, reveal the names of people killed by drones, end mass surveillance and end the constant state of war,’ he said. Opened by President George W. Bush in 2002, Guantanamo became a symbol of the excesses of his administration's ‘war on terror’ interrogation and detention practices. Even he expressed a desire to close the camp near the end of his presidency. While seeking to turn the page on the Bush era, Mr Obama failed to meet his promise to shut the prison within a year of taking office in early 2009. Though he recommitted several times to his pledge, he was reluctant to set a new time frame for achieving it. Obama stopped short in his speech of offering any new prescriptions on how he intends to empty Guantanamo of its remaining 155 prisoners . Long a subject of international criticism but low on the list of the American public's concerns, Guantanamo was thrust back in the spotlight last year by a hunger strike and the military's decision to force-feed prisoners to keep them alive. Mr Obama's renewed promise followed congressional passage in December of a broader defense spending bill that loosened some restrictions on his ability to send more of the detainees home. Despite that, he still faces limits on his room to maneuver. Lawmakers refused to budge on a ban on bringing Guantanamo prisoners to the U.S. mainland. On top of that, complications remain with Yemen, where U.S. officials fear released prisoners might join up with an active al Qaeda branch. Yemen's government also has yet to build a long-promised detention center for any prisoners sent home. About half of Guantanamo's remaining detainees have been cleared for transfer or release since 2009, but most were blocked from going home because of congressional restrictions. Still, nearly four dozen prisoners are considered too dangerous to release. And Obama can also expect continued pressure from some lawmakers, including Republican critics, who want to keep Guantanamo open. Despite that, the administration has shown signs of a more active transfer policy in recent months. It sent two detainees back to Sudan, two to Saudi Arabia and two to Algeria, and it sent the three remaining ethnic Uighur Chinese inmates to Slovakia. Mr Obama also used his speech to reassure a war-weary American public that the U.S. military was on track to withdraw from Afghanistan after more than a decade of war there. ‘We will complete our mission there by the end of this year, and America's longest war will finally be over,’ he said. He also sent a thinly veiled warning to Afghan President Hamid Karzai, who is locked in a test of wills with Washington over efforts to reach a long-term security pact that would enable a small contingent of U.S. forces to remain in the country beyond 2014. The White House has warned that it will resort to a ‘zero option,’ pulling out all U.S. forces at the end of the year unless he signs a security deal soon.","President pledged to shut Guantanamo Bay prison five years ago .

As well as voters in the deprived region of having to agree to pay 'special taxes' to fund the project since its inception back in 2005, the promise of 700 flights a year by 2015, with two flights out a day, has failed to materialise. New Mexico's hope that it would be spearheading a new technological age remains a distant dream, despite Branson's latest newscast. According to Reuters, a grand total of ten jobs have so far actually been created on the site for local residents. That’s 0.33 per cent of the number that was originally promised.

"A 19-year old girl's family discovered her unconscious in her bedroom next to a pool of her own vomit. Shayla Ream was rushed to a local Eugene, Oregon hospital on December 13 after she most-likely inhaled the household product called Dust-Off to get high. Doctors agree with the girl's family that the Dust-Off is the most probable cause of death. Despite her grandfather's efforts to give her CPR before the paramedics arrived, the girl was in critical condition and died in the hospital the next morning. Shayla Ream made the mistakes over 2 million teenagers do each year by deciding to inhale Dust Off . Dust Off cuts off oxygen to the brain and just trying it once could be a fatal choice . She is survived by her mother Tina Osborne, her stepfather Doug Osborne, her sister cassandra Ream, and her grandparents Margaret and Billy Ream  and Bonnie and Bob Osborne. Shayla's sister Cassandra has spoken out about her sister's death in the hopes that other people won't make the same fatal mistake her sister made. She spoke to a KVAL News reporter at services at lane Memorial Funeral Home on Friday and said,'I wouldn’t want this to happen to anybody else,' Cassandra said. 'I really care about other people and for their sake and I know that my sister would care about them.' Her sister described how the compressed gas her sister inhaled killed her in only a few minutes. 'It coated her lungs as she huffed the inhalant called Dust-Off,' Cassandra said. 'When that happened it left no more oxygen to her brain, which shut off all of her organs. And it only happened in a matter of minutes.' Shayla's sister Cassandra is speaking out against the drug that took her sister's life . Unfortunately, inhalants like Dust-Off have become a popular drug of choice for teenagers because they are sold over the counter at most convenient stores. The use of inhalants for recreational purposes is called huffing and is more prevalent among the youth than people may think. According to information from inhalant.org, over 2.6 million children between the ages of 12 and 17 use inhalants each year. Huffing is a popular drug among teenagers and is most likely the first drug they will try . Inhalants tend to be one of the first drugs tried by children and a shocking 59 per cent of children are aware of huffing each year. Huffing is the fourth most abused substance after alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana. Statistics about huffing related deaths are inaccurate because the deaths are often attributed to other causes. Shayla's sister Cassandra believes huffing is what kept her sister from fulfilling her dreams. 'She was in her first semester of LCC, and then she was trying to become a wedding planner,' Cassandra said to Kval.com. 'She was starting to become somebody.

'My son was raised up believing in God. That's what he believes,' she said. 'That's not my son. There is two sides to every story and we are only hearing one.' 'His family, our hearts bleed right now because what they saying Alton has done,' she said. 'I want to apologize to both families — because this is not Alton.'

'Killer': The suspect  reportedly beheaded Colleen Hufford, 54, and stabbed Traci Johnson, 43, before he was shot and wounded by off-duty sheriff's deputy and firm CEO Mark Vaughan. Above, Nolen reads the Koran . Hufford, who had been married for 25 years, had lost her family home in the Moore tornado. Her neighbours described her as 'quick to smile' and said her husband picked her up from the food processing plant every night and he was outside when he found out she had been killed. Today it was revealed that Nolen had served less than two years of a six-year prison sentence for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, reports News OK. According to records he went to prison March 10, 2011, to start a two-year sentence for marijuana possession and another two-year sentence for assaulting a highway patrol trooper, the website reported. He began his six-year sentence for cocaine possession April 26, 2011, records show - due to plea agreements with prosecutors, he was allowed to serve the three prison sentences at the same time. He was released on March 22, 2013, records show. 'Our intent was to incarcerate him much longer than a year and 11 months,' Oklahoma County District Attorney David Prater said Friday. 'This case perfectly illustrates the problem with the Department of Corrections.' 'If it's not an 85 percent crime, we have no idea how long a person will actually spend in prison,' Prater said. An FBI investigation into the incident is still pending, and Deputy National Security Adviser Tony Blinken told Fox News it is not known whether the act was one of terror. On Nolen's Facebook page, listed under the name Jah’Keem Yisrael, he posted photos of Osama bin Laden and Taliban fighters, along with posts condemning a variety of aspects of American life. Posts ranged from religious iconography to stock photography to even photos of supposed UFO activity. It also included a graphic photo of a beheading. In prayer: It has emerged that Nolen (seen praying) apparently celebrated terrorism, promoted Islam and disparaged non-Muslims in a series of posts on Facebook in the months leading up to the alleged killing . At work: Meanwhile, in another, he uploaded a photo of the Joker with a message criticising the 'wicked' U.S. for not helping the people of Gaza against Israel. Above, Nolen is pictured loading food onto a shelf at work . In custody: Over a one-year period, Nolen also apparently posted images of Osama bin Laden, deadly weaponry, a poster reading 'Islam will dominate the world' and children learning how to shoot guns . Islamic convert: Other posts saw Nolen reading the Koran, donning Muslim religious clothing (pictured), praying in a mosque and seemingly performing the one-figure salute of the Islamic State terror group . Meanwhile, a spokesman for an Oklahoma City Islamic group said Saturday that Nolen was a frequent worshiper at a mosque the group maintains and that he remembers the suspect as 'a little weird.' 'He was a nice, quiet, low-key guy,' said Saad Mohammed, director of information for the Islamic Society of Greater Oklahoma City. 'He acted a little odd,' Mohammed said, though he added that Nolen's behavior never raised any 'red flags' since he began worshiping at one of the group's centers in May. He also said that Nolen attended services where sermons were delivered against beheadings like those committed by Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, militants, reports CBS News. 'In no way, shape or form did he represent Islam in this foolish act,' Mohammed said. Records show that Nolen has what appear to be religious tattoos, including one referencing Jesus and one in Arabic that means 'peace be with you.' Scene: On Friday, 911 calls revealed the panic of employees, with a caller telling the dispatcher: 'They're in the office, front office of the building. Yeah, we can hear a lot of screaming. Above, the scene at Vaughan Foods . Heroic: Mark Vaughan, pictured above, shot the suspect multiple times to put an end to his killing spree. Mr Vaughan is the former president of the company, left, and a reserve sheriff's deputy, rig . Lewis said Nolen was fired right before the attack, and that he then drove from the building that houses the company's human resources department to its main distribution center. Once inside, he attacked 54-year-old Colleen Hufford with a knife in the center's administrative office area, eventually severing her head, according to police. Nolen then repeatedly stabbed 43-year-old Traci Johnson before Mark Vaughan, a reserve sheriff's deputy and the company's chief operating officer, shot him, police said. Johnson was treated for her injuries at the University of Oklahoma Medical Center, where she was released Saturday, said Varina Shellman, clinical coordinator for the medical center. Emotional: Employees and friends wait behind a tape for word of loved ones as police investigate on Thursday . Sadness: Workers stand in silence outside Vaughan Foods as they wait to leave following the grisly attack . Overwhelmed: A worker from Vaughan Foods reacts after her colleague was beheaded during the attack . Lewis said Johnson was also interviewed Saturday. Police learned Nolen was fired for 'numerous reasons' involving 'personnel issues,' Lewis said, adding that he didn't know the specifics. Police asked the FBI to help investigate Nolen after co-workers told investigators he had recently started trying to convert several employees to Islam. Lewis said police asked the FBI to look into Nolen's background because of the nature of the attack, which followed a series of high-profile videotaped beheadings by Islamic State militants. In a statement, FBI Special Agent in Charge James E. Finch said the motive for the attack had not been determined, but that there is no reason to believe there was a threat to anyone else. 'We don't have any reason to believe there is any danger to the area,' Lewis said.","Alton Nolen, 30, allegedly killed Colleen Hufford, 54, and attacked Traci Johnson, 43, at the Vaughan Foods facility in Moore, Oklahoma .

"A former recruitment manager who stole from 250 changing room lockers over a 12-year period is back behind bars after being caught in the act again. Jeanette Fidler, nicknamed The Magpie, has stolen cash, mobile phones and jewellery from members of gyms, health centres and leisure centres across the north-west. One victim lost her engagement and wedding rings and on other occasions Fidler managed to break into five different lockers in one swoop. Looking younger: Mother-of-three Jeanette Fidler who has clocked up 250 offences over the last 12 years is pictured here in 2002 when she was addicted to heroin (left) and then again in 2011 (right) after she had come off the drug . Despite being repeatedly arrested and jailed, Fidler would get out of prison and do the same thing again. Yesterday she was locked up again after being caught rifling through a woman's handbag at a gym in Saddleworth, Greater Manchester, for bank cards last June. She later used a Visa card she took to order flowers from Interflora. Judge Bernard Lever told the 41-year-old mother-of-three that he had previously warned her she would go to jail if she was caught stealing again. 'I remember this case and I remember telling . you that if you breached the order you would be sentenced to custody,' he said. 'Yet you rifled a locker again as is your regular behaviour. Everybody . has tried with you.' Mark Fireman, mitigating, said that Fidler - who gave birth to her third child last July - no longer took drugs. He said: 'This is a woman who struggled for many years with an . addiction to class A drugs. Thief: Jeanette Fidler has clocked up 250 offences since 2000 after becoming hooked on drugs . Target: Fidler was jailed after admitting stealing from a locker at Saddleworth leisure centre . 'She . has become a mother again and she wishes to look after her child. She . has removed herself from the area where she was committing crime and she . has moved away from the people she was committing crime with. It is . worth taking a final chance.' The call centre worker, from Stalybridge, was given an Asbo in 2012 which banned her from entering gyms and swimming pools for four years. Her downfall began in 2000 after . she lost her job and became hooked on drugs while living in . Huddersfield, West Yorkshire. To pay off her debts she spent two years preying on sports centre users and taking wallets and keys. During her crime spree police mugshots emerged of Fidler looking haggard and drawn due to her years of heavy heroin abuse which contrasted with her healthy look when she was not taking the drug. Thief: Fidler has previously targeted the Village Gym in Hyde, Greater Manchester in 2012, during her 12-year crime spree . Raid: Fidler sneaked into the Waterside Hotel and Leisure Centre in Didsbury, Manchester, in June 2012 and broke into five lockers and took £205 . The court heard yesterday that after being released early from prison on . licence following a previous jail term, she sneaked into the Waterside Hotel and . Leisure Centre in Didsbury, Manchester, in June 2012 and broke into five lockers and took £205. Two days later she targeted the changing rooms at the Village Gym in Hyde, stealing four mobile phones worth . £1,900 plus £285 in cash and a debit card. When she was given her Asbo in November 2012, she was spared jail because she had managed to kick her heroin addiction. At the time, Judge Lever told her: 'You have committed more of these . offences than I've had hot dinners. 'You have been a . one-person crimewave going round these leisure centres and rifling . people's property. 'Why on earth should people have to put up with this? My natural inclination would be to jail you for a very long time.'","Jeanette Fidler jailed for a year after being caught stealing from a gym .

"A five-year-old boy who was quarantined with a 103F fever after a family trip to west Africa has tested negative for Ebola. The child was reportedly vomiting with bloodshot eyes when emergency medical workers wearing protective Hazmat suits rushed him from his Bronx home to rushed to New York's Bellevue Hospital on Sunday night at 9pm. The little boy was pictured being stretchered out of his home, completely wrapped in protective clothing while his mother followed covering her face with a mask. The boy has been quarantined with his mother at Bellevue, New York's designated Ebola care center. Her health is being monitored and she is exhibiting no symptoms. Scroll down for video . Negative: A five-year-old boy who developed Ebola-like symptoms after returning home from Guinea, West Africa has tested negative for the virus. He was pictured on Sunday night being stretchered out of his Bronx home in New York by Hazmat-suited emergency responders while completely wrapped in protective clothing . FDNY workers remove their protective biohazard clothing at Bellevue Hospital on Sunday after a five-year-old boy was transported to the medical facility with suspected Ebola symptoms . An FDNY worker in a Hazmat suit at Bellevue Hospital on Sunday after transporting a boy with Ebola-like symptoms who had returned with his family from a trip to Guinea . The five-year-old had returned from a family trip to Guinea on Saturday night on a Moroccan Airlines flight which landed at JFK. He was screened but did not have a fever when he entered the U.S., CDC director Dr Tom Frieden said on Monday. A team of 'disease detectives' were tracing the boy's contacts on Monday in case he tested positive for the virus. Four members of the child's family have been quarantined inside their apartment at 172nd Street, law enforcement officials said, but told EMTs that they did not have contact with anyone infected with Ebola while in Guinea. Those under quarantine at the Bronx apartment are believed to be the boy's father, 52, a 15-year-old sister and two brothers, aged 13 and two years old, the Daily News reported. A New York City Health department official hands out information on the Ebola virus to people riding on a school bus near a Bronx apartment building where a 5-year-old boy who arrived from Guinea was taken to Bellevue Hospital on Sunday . Police stand guard outside an apartment building at 172nd Street on Monday in the Bronx where a five-year-old boy was rushed to hospital on Monday after developing Ebola-like symptoms the day after returning from Guinea in West Africa . The building was being guarded by police today as community outreach workers handed out leaflets with information about Ebola. The boy's preliminary test results were expected later today, hospital officials said on Monday. Commissioner of the NYC Health Department, Dr Mary Bassett, said: 'He has no clear exposure to Ebola but his exposure history is unclear.' Neighbors in the six-story building appeared not to have been informed about a resident with Ebola-like symptoms. One neighbor told the New York Post: 'He looked out of it. I hope he’ll be OK. They’re a nice, hardworking family... I heard he was playing with the neighbor’s kids and she sent them to school today.' Guinea is one of the three countries, along with Liberia and Sierra Leone, at the center of the current Ebola outbreak in West Africa. It has since grown into the largest ever outbreak of the disease killing some 5,000 people in the region. The boy was rushed to Bellevue from his home in the Bronx after developing a 103F and vomiting, emergency workers said . New York's first confirmed Ebola patient, Dr Craig Spencer, is currently being treated in an isolation ward at Bellevue Hospital after contracting the virus in  Guinea. He was in a serious but stable condition on Monday, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said. The hospital said that he was 'awake, communicating, and in good spirits' but has entered the next stage of his illness. He is receiving antiviral therapy as well as plasma therapy after getting a plasma transfusion from Ebola survivor, aid worker Nancy Writebol. Mrs Writebol, 59, recovered from Ebola after contracting the virus during missionary work in Liberia in July. Dr Spencer, 33, was admitted to the hospital on Thursday - just six days after returning from Guinea where he he was helping to fight the outbreak with the Doctors Without Borders organisation. His fiancée, 30-year-old Morgan Dixon, who was initially being quarantined at Bellevue has been allowed to go home under quarantine. It was reported this weekend that Bellevue hospital staff caring for Dr Spencer were being denied service at local restaurants and had their children treated differently. Tests: A five-year-old boy is being treated at New York's Bellevue Hospital after showing possible Ebola symptoms after returning from a  trip to Guinea in West Africa . Trip: The youngster returned from a family trip to Guinea (pictured) on Saturday. The country is at the centre of the current Ebola outbreak with the first cases reported in south east Gueckedou region in March . Mayor Bill de Blasio held an afternoon press conference in which he called such treatment 'absolutely unacceptable', and said there would be consequences for  individuals' found disrespecting nurses or other medical personnel. Dr Craig Spencer returned to New York from Guinea on October 17, and was admitted to hospital six days later with symptoms of the deadly virus . Mayor de Blasio and his wife Chiraline McCray visited the isolation ward at Bellevue where Dr Spencer is being treated and said the volunteering health care workers they encountered there were 'calm, cool, collected and purposeful'. However, he was shocked to hear reports about how some of these doctors and nurses were being denied food and treated differently when strangers learned they worked at the hospital. Mayor de Blasio did not specify what kind of punishment could be handed out. The mayor described the Bellevue workers treating Dr Craig Spencer as the 'the first responders in this crisis' and like 'the Marines of our health care system'. The mayor also addressed a nurse who was being monitored this weekend in New Jersey, under new rules in both New Jersey and New York requiring health care workers returning from West Africa to submit to a 21-day quarantine. Nurse Kaci Hickox talked to CNN about her 'inhumane' containment at the airport, saying she is confined in a tent with limited contact to the outside world, no flushable toilet, TV or reading material. 'Unacceptable': New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio held a press conference on Sunday to address reports that Bellevue health care workers were being mistreated for working at the hospital where the city's first Ebola patient is being cared for . Mayor de Blasio appeared to hit out at New Jersey officials, by calling the conditions of Ms Hickox's quarantine 'inappropriate'. 'The problem here is that this hero coming back from the front, having done the right thing, was treated with disrespect and was treated as if she had done something wrong when she hadn't,' Mayor de Blasio said. 'We owe her better than that.' However, the mayor added that he respects the right of other governments to make their own decisions in how to handle this outbreak. 'Inhumane': Mayor De Blasio also spoke about Nurse Kaci Hickox, who is currently under quarantine in New Jersey. The nurse spoke to CNN, calling her quarantine 'inhumane' for having no access to a flushable toilet, TV or reading material.

"Ryanair has announced it will begin to allocate seats from next year - but it will still cost almost £5 if you want to choose it yourself. The budget airline, which has been criticised for treating passengers ‘like the enemy’, says it has listened to customers who dislike the scramble to get on board. From February travellers can pay five . euros - £4.23 - to choose their seat while the rest will be allocated in . the 24 hours prior to departure. The airline's shares have dropped more than 11 per cent after it issued today a second profit warning in as many months after forecasting they would be . hammered by downward pressure on fares. Take a seat - for £5: Ryanair today announced it would allocate seats from February, but you can choose in advance if you pay . Finances: Ryanair, run by Michael O'Leary, today issued a second profit warning in as many months after forecasting they would be hammered by downward pressure on fares . The . low-cost airline expects average fares to drop by nine per cent in the . three months to Christmas and possibly decline by a further 10 per cent . in the first three months of next year. Change of tune: The airline, which has developed a reputation for poor service and high fees, also announced last month a change in other rules to keep customers on side . Ryanair . said its surplus for the year to March 31 may dip to as low as 500million euros - £423.3 million - from the 569million euros - £486.9million - achieved last year. For . the period to September 30 - a period when airlines make most of their . money - Ryanair recorded profits growth of one per cent to 602million euros - £509.7million. The airline was among the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100 this morning following the warning, down nearly 12 per cent at 5.40p. Average . fares fell by two per cent in the half year, although revenues from areas . such as the roll out of reserved seating, priority boarding and higher . credit debit card fees grew by 22 per cent to 713million euros - £603.7 . million. Boss Michael O'Leary, who has been at the airline for 19 years, is also believed to be considering leaving the company. Last month he was bombarded on Twitter after agreeing to host a question-and-answer session from customers. The boss posted a picture of himself on the social networking site dressed as a leprechaun before fielding tweets. He was using the stunt as part of a drive to improve the public image of the airline, which was recently voted worst of 100 biggest brands by Which? readers. One Twitter user, Matt Trilby asked him: 'Does anyone in your organisation have any experience of running an airline?' Andy McGeady joked: 'How much will Michael charge per reply? And are you charging me to send this tweet?' It forced him to announce that Ryanair would introduce ‘family-friendly’ deals and discounts as it tries to win back passengers put off by its ‘mistakes’ and reputation for poor customer service. The airline’s flamboyant boss apologised for his airline’s ‘over-abrupt culture’ and pledged to stop 'p****** off' customers. Having fun: Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary poses in a leprechaun hat and beard as he fields questions on Twitter last month, but later got a hammering off customers . Anger: Some Twitter users took the opportunity to vent their frustrations about the company . He said strict hand-luggage restrictions would be relaxed to allow ‘small ladies’ handbags’ and airport shopping to be carried onto the plane in addition to the stated allowance. Mr O’Leary also pledged not to overly penalise passengers who make a ‘genuine mistake’ – such as forgetting to bring their boarding card, which often results in a £70 charge to reprint them. He said that Ryanair was ‘evolving’ and becoming more ‘sophisticated’. He added: ‘In the past we have said, “That’s the policy – go to hell”. That culture needs  to evolve.’ Ryanair customers took to Twitter to broadly welcome the airline's decision to allocate seats but most said it should have been done sooner. Here are a selection of opinions from Twitter: .","From February you can pay for a seat or wait to be allocated one for free .
Came as airline today announced second profits warning in two months .
Expects to make about £420m profit - up to £60m less than forecast .

This is compounded by the fact that . the sex-ratio in China has remained abnormally askew for nearly three . decades following China's launch of its one-child policy. China has traditionally been a patriarchal society and medical advances have also allowed more parents to choose to have a boy. Dozens of posters hang in the park revealing details about the single children including height, age, income, education and whether they own a car or an apartment . This shift means that by 2020, the country will have . approximately 24 million unmarried men who cannot find wives, according to recent studies.

"A Brisbane man is living the life of the future after having a microchip implanted under his skin so he can control electronic devices with just a wave of a hand. Ben Slater had a radio-frequency identification microchip - which has similar measurements to a grain of rice - injected into his left hand through a syringe two weeks ago at a Melbourne tattoo parlour. The advertising director's move comes as technology enthusiasts eagerly await the unveiling of the iPhone 6 in two days time. Scroll down for video . Ben Slater has had a microchip inserted into his hand to allow him to open doors and switch on lights with the wave of his hand . Mr Slater said he did it because he had always been fascinated with the future of technology . He hopes the new generation of Apple's smart phone will have the capability to read the microchip implanted in the webbing between his thumb and forefinger. The new addition to his body means Mr Slater can swing his front door open, switch on his lights and store personal information with the flick of his hand. 'The most obvious thing the chip allows me to do is store my contact information on it, so that I can just touch a phone with NFC and pass my information to their phone. That is a great party trick,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'But it can also trigger an action on my phone to turn the house lights off, open a secure door which is set to recognise the chip or I could - and probably will - set up my car ignition to be linked to the chip for keyless entry and start up.' Mr Slater told Daily Mail Australia he made the decision to implant the microchip because he had always been interested in the future of technology. 'I wanted to get the chip implanted to generate discussion,' he said. 'It intrigues me that we live in an age where this type of activity is even possible, especially for some seeming random guy in Australia to arrange to have done.' It was inserted in a Melbourne tattoo parlour with a syringe containing the chip . Mr Slater said the procedure to implant the microchip was painful, but over quickly. 'I just needed to be really careful when it was healing over the course of the two weeks later so that I didn't move it - otherwise it could have travelled in my hand,' he said. The microchip implant may still be new to Australian shores, but it has become a growing trend in the United States after it was introduced in 2004 when the nation's Food and Drug Administration gave the green light for its use to carry information about people's medical conditions, according to The Sydney Morning Herald. The iPhone 6 is expected to be the largest phone Apple has produced, with a 5.5-inch screen. It is believed the handset is so large that it will come with a special 'one-handed' mode to make it easier for people to use it. Anticipation over the phone is so high that people in the U.S. started lining up outside Apple stores two weeks ago to be one of the first to get a slice of the action. In the U.S., the chip is used to store the medical information of people with illness . Mr Slater hopes the new generation iPhone 6 - which will be launched on September 6 - will have the capability to read the chip .","Advertising director Ben Slater had the microchip inserted two weeks ago .

"Scientists believe they have discovered why modern humans develop brain disorders like autism, schizophrenia and Alzheimer's but our near-identical Neanderthal cousins did not. They say that while present-day humans and our extinct Neanderthal relatives are 99.84 per cent genetically identical, there are important differences. They discovered the cellular equivalent of ‘on/off’ switches that determine whether DNA is activated or not. Scientists believe they have discovered why modern humans can develop autism while Neanderthals did not . Hundreds of Neanderthals' genes were turned ‘off’ while the identical genes in today's humans are turned ‘on’. The international team of researchers, who reported their findings in industry journal Science, also discovered hundreds of other genes were turned ‘on’ in Neanderthals, but are ‘off’ in people living today. Among these genes are those that control the shape of limbs and the function of the brain - traits where modern humans and Neanderthals differ most. And the genes related to autism, as well as to schizophrenia and Alzheimer’s disease, were more likely to be ‘off’ in Neanderthals than in modern humans. The discovery also underlines the power of the ‘on/off’ patterns. Together, they add up to what is called the human epigenome, to distinguish it from the human genome. The genome is the sequence of three . billion molecules that constitute all of a person's DNA, while the . epigenome is which parts of that DNA are turned ‘on’ or ‘off’ - even as the . molecular sequence remains unchanged. Some DNA that was switched 'off' in Neanderthals is switched 'on' in modern humans and vice versa . The epigenome exerts such powerful effects that it is often called the ‘second genetic code’. In an interview Liram Carmel, of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, who led the study, speculated that any given gene might ‘do many things in the brain’. When dozens of brain-related genes became more active in today's humans, that produced the harmful side effect of neurological illnesses. But the main effect might have been the astonishing leap in brain development that most distinguishes modern Homo sapiens from our extinct cousins. The ‘on/off’ switches could also explain the anatomical differences between archaic and present-day humans, including Neanderthals' shorter legs and arms, bow-leggedness, large hands and fingers, and curved arm bones. One caveat about the research is that one person's epigenome can vary markedly from another's due to diet, environment and other factors. It is therefore impossible to know whether the ‘on/off’ patterns found in Neanderthal genes are typical of the species overall or peculiar to the individual studied.","Modern humans and Neanderthals are 99.84% genetically identical .
But there is an 'on/off' switch that determines if particular DNA is activated .
Many genes that were 'on' in Neanderthals are 'off' in modern humans .
Others that were 'off' in Neanderthals and 'on' in modern man .

"Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul was walloped on Thursday by a series of media reports that concluded he was wrong to claim fellow GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona unwittingly met with ISIS terrorists when he held a secret 2013 meeting with rebel leaders in Syria. 'Here’s the problem,' Paul told The Daily Beast on Tuesday. 'He [McCain] did meet with ISIS, and had his picture taken, and didn't know it was happening at the time.' Paul contends that the Obama administration's effort to 'train and equip' moderate Syrian rebels against ISIS, the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham, is foolhardy because the U.S. could wind up arming radical jihadis if alliances shift in the future. The McCain photos, he said, show 'the quandary of determining who are the moderates and who aren’t. ... The objective evidence is that the ones doing most of the fighting and most of the battles among the rebels in Syria are the radical Islamists.' On the Senate floor Wednesday, Paul doubled down. 'We don't even know who is in charge of the Free Syrian Army,' he said  'They voted out one guy, and in another, and he didn't even know they were voting. There are estimates that half of the Free Syrian Army has defected to al Qaeda and ISIS.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Sen. John McCain (center) met with anti-Assad Syrian rebels in May 2013, sparking rumors that some fighters shown with him in photos later joined forces with ISIS . Sen. Rand Paul claimed Tuesday that McCain 'did meet with ISIS, and had his picture taken, and didn't know it was happening at the time' McCain has long been an advocate of arming rebel groups, arguing even before ISIS became a regional menace that they should have U.S. support to fight dictator Bashar al-Assad. The Daily Beast immediately shredded Paul's claim, and a Washington Post fact-checker quickly followed suit. Paul's office did not respond to a request for comment from MailOnline. Central to the flap is the loyalty of the Northern Storm Brigade, a group aligned with the Free Syrian Army (FSA), a force that the Obama administration considers anti-ISIS. Congress passed legislation on Thursday authorizing funds to train and equip FSA fighters and other moderate rebel groups. Paul's claim has only the thinnest of evidence to support it. It was sparked by a liberal veterans' advocacy group, VoteVets.org, which claimed McCain 'paused for some photos' while in Syria, 'including some with ISIS militants.' The claim emerged on August 19, 2014, the day ISIS released the first of its three grisly beheading videos showing the death of American photojournalist James Foley. President Barack Obama addressed the nation Thursday night after Congress approved funding for an effort to train and arm Syrian rebel groups, a move that Rand Paul says will have unintended consequences as alliances in the Middle East shift in the future . UNCONFIRMED: Online reports claimed in August 2013 that ISIS and the Northern Storm Brigade collaborated to capture an airport from forces loyal to dictator Bashar al-Assad . A single report from the Aleppo News Network served as the basis for claims that both ISIS and the Northern Storm brigade were involved in the capture of the airport . McCain's now-famous meeting took place in May 2013 after he slipped across the Turkish border into northern Syria, meeting with rebel leaders for about an hour. Photos showed him in the company of Northern Storm leaders, who buttressed his security detail during the trip. Three months later the Northern Storm Brigade seized an airport at the Syrian town of Mengh, completing a battle that had raged for a half-year. Twitter accounts at the time, based on reporting from the Aleppo News Network, claimed ISIS militants fought alongside them. But that has never been established. By October, the two groups were publicly at each other's throats. But adding to the confusion – and buttressing Paul's case – a month later the Free Syrian Army admitted to the Lebanon's Daily Star that it had joined forces with ISIS to attack Assad's forces in the Qalamoun region of Syria. 'We are collaborating with the Islamic State and the Nusra Front by attacking the Syrian Army’s gatherings,' one FSA commander told the newspaper. 'We have reached a point where we have to collaborate with anyone against unfairness and injustice,' said another. McCain snuck into Syria from Turkey in May 2013, assisted by a rebel group called the Northern Storm Brigade -- which had an on-again, off-again relationship much later with the ISIS terror army . Mouaz Moustafa, executive director of the Syrian Emergency Task Force, a U.S.-based group that helped arrange McCain's 2013 Syria excursion but didn't choose the meeting participants, told The New York Times last week that at present, ISIS is the Northern Storm's sworn enemy. The first issue of ISIS's glossy color magazine, Moustafa told the Times, included copies of the photos including McCain and the Northern Storm fighters along with an exhortation to 'cut all these people’s heads off.' Shortly after the meeting, McCain spokesman Brian Rogers said that the photos were part of McCain's customary good will. 'A number of the Syrians who greeted Senator McCain upon his arrival in Syria asked to take pictures with him, and as always, the Senator complied,' he said. As the two senators' feud deepened this week, McCain set his case back a step by misspeaking during a Fox News Channel interview, chastizing Paul for never having visited Syria himself. 'Has Rand Paul ever been to Syria?' he asked. 'Has he ever met with ISIS? Has he ever met with any of these people?'","McCain snuck into Syria in May 2013 to meet with Free Syrian Army (FSA) rebels and encourage them in their fight against dictator Bashar al-Assad .

"The US ambassador to the United Nations has slammed the level of international support for countries hit by Ebola - claiming the response needs to go to 'a wholly different scale'. Samantha Power, a member of President Barack Obama's . cabinet, left Washington on Saturday bound for Guinea, Liberia . and Sierra Leone. Beginning her tour of the west African countries she stated today that too many leaders were praising the efforts of others while doing little themselves. Scroll down for video . Samantha Power, a member of President Barack Obama'scabinet, left Washington on Saturday bound for Guinea, Liberiaand Sierra Leone . Speaking to NBC she said: 'You have countries at the United Nations where I work every day who are signing on to resolutions and praising the good work that the United States and the United Kingdom and others are doing. 'But they themselves haven't taken the responsibility yet to send docs, to send beds, to send the reasonable amount of money.' Last week, she claimed   the international community 'isn't just losing the race to Ebola - we are getting lapped'. But today she added that the 'mere fact of going as a member of the president's cabinet [shows] that we shouldn't be afraid'. Her message was clear: 'We need to be part of the solution and not run away from something, because it'll come to us if we don't deal with it at its source.' She also stressed how health workers should be 'praised as heroes' and not stigmatized when they return home. More than 10,000 people have been infected with the deadly disease and nearly 5,000 have died in West Africa. Pictured here, health workers in Sierra Leone despite of a a victim of the epidemic . Her comments come as three US states mandated widely-criticised quarantine laws for health workers returning from the Ebola-stricken region. Obama has resisted Republican calls for a . travel ban to affected countries on advice from health officials who say such a . measure would be counter-productive. Along with New York and New Jersey, Illinois has now imposed quarantines for anyone arriving with a risk of having contracted Ebola in West Africa. But the first person isolated under the . new rules called her treatment a 'frenzy of disorganization.' Kaci Hickox, a nurse returning from Sierra Leone, arrived at . Newark airport on Friday and was questioned by protective-gear . clad officials amid what she said was a mis-diagnosis of fever, . followed by a transfer to a hospital isolation tent. Samantha Power meets with Guinea President Alpha Conde (R) in the country's capital Conakry yesterday . Hickox said she feared for what lies ahead for other U.S. health workers trying to help combat the epidemic that has . killed thousands in West Africa. 'Will they be made to feel like criminals and prisoners?' she wrote in an article published on Saturday by The Dallas . Morning News on its website. 'I am scared that, like me, they will arrive and see a . frenzy of disorganization, fear and, most frightening, . quarantine,' wrote Hickox, of charity Doctors Without Borders. More than 10,000 people have contracted the Ebola virus, with 4,922 deaths, according to the World Health Organization's most recent figures. All but 27 of the cases have occurred inside Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. New York and New Jersey imposed 21-day quarantines after a . New York City doctor was diagnosed with the disease on Thursday, . days after returning home from working with patients in Guinea. The doctor's case and the fact he was out and about in the . city in the period before his symptoms emerged set off renewed . worries in the United States about the spread of the disease. The ambassador sanitizes her hands and has her temperature taken at the Guinea headquarters for the United Nations Ebola response mission yesterday . Illinois will now also require a mandatory quarantine of . anyone who has had direct contact with Ebola patients in those . countries. The quarantines imposed by the three states exceed . current U.S. government guidelines, although the Obama . administration is discussing similar measures. Ebola, spread through direct contact with bodily fluids from . an infected person, is not transmitted by people who are not . showing symptoms. Hickox's account of her treatment echoed concerns of critics . of the mandatory quarantines who say they could discourage . Americans from going to help control the epidemic. Health workers carry the body of an Ebola virus victim in the Waterloo district of Freetown last week . Ebola has killed almost half of more than 10,000 people . diagnosed with the disease - predominantly in Liberia, Sierra . Leone and Guinea - although the true toll is far higher, . according to the World Health Organization. Doctors Without Borders has criticized Hickox's treatment. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, asked by reporters about the . nurse's complaints, said his first obligation was the safety of . the people of New Jersey. 'Inconvenience that could occur from having folks that are . symptomatic and ill out amongst the public is a much, much . greater concern of mine,' he said.","Samantha Power left Washington Saturday for tour of Ebola-hit west Africa .

"Barack Obama could become the latest in a short list of impeached U.S. presidents, according to Sen. Jim Inhofe and Daily Beast columnist Michael Tomasky . The specter of impeachment proceedings against President Barack Obama over an alleged Benghazi cover-up has been raised for the first time, with a conservative senator and a liberal political columnist both hinting that 'the ""I"" word' could be in play. Oklahoma Republican Sen. Jim Inhofe said Thursday on the Rusty Humphries radio show that what he called the 'greatest cover-up in American history' could soon enter impeachment territory. 'People may be starting to use the ""I""-word before too long,” Inhofe said. 'The I-word meaning impeachment?' Humphries, the host, asked. 'Yeah,' Inhofe replied. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . The Hill first reported on Inhofe's comments, which came less than a day before Newsweek columnist Michael Tomasky followed suit. During Friday's airing of the MSNBC program Now, Tomasky responded to the suggestion that Republicans' political knives are out for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in advance of the 2016 presidential election - by saying that the episode could reach into the Oval Office and snare its current occupant. Benghazi hearings, he said, could point to 'that word that starts with ""I.""' 'It becomes a potential impeachment issue,' Tomasky said, 'as long as the Republicans are in control of the House.' An Obama impeachment? Inhofe (L) and Tomasky (R) are suggesting that it could come over the fast-growing Benghazi scandal . The impeachment of a sitting president is rare, and would originate with charges brought in the Republican-dominated House of Representatives. The Senate, however, votes on whether to convict an impeached president. That body is currently controlled by Democrats, and the status of its majority is likely to be a hotly contested issue in the 2014 mid-term election. President Bill Clinton's impeachment was stopped in a Democratic-controlled senate, which refused to convict him on charges that he lied, while under oath, about his affair with a White House intern. The Hill noted that Fox News Channel host and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee has predicted that Obama 'will not serve out his full term' because of Benghazi-related accusations. ABC News uncovered 12 versions of the infamous Benghazi talking points, suggesting that the Obama administration was more involved with editing them than it has admitted . 'This is not good for the White House right now,' said MSNBC host Luke Russert (C). Buzzfeed's Ben Smith (R) agreed that it doesn't look good, and Michael Tomasky of The Daily Beast (second from R) raised 'the ""I"" word' ABC News revealed Friday that a set of public talking points on the Sept. 11, 2012 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya was edited 12 times, and ultimately presented a false reading of the terror attack. State Department personnel had a hand in proposing those revisions, emails leaked to ABC show, despite the White House's insistence that its political appointees had no 'substantive' role in changing the official Benghazi story. Ultimately UN Ambassador Susan Rice, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and President Obama all referred publicly to the terror attack as the result of a spontaneous protest sparked by an anti-Islam YouTube video. 'Here's what happened,' Obama told David Letterman on his CBS nighttime talk show on Sept. 18. 'You had a video that was released by somebody who lives here, sort of a shadowy character who made an extremely offensive video directed at Mohammed and Islam, making fun of the Prophet Mohammed,' the president said. 'And so this caused great offense in much of the Muslim world. But what also happened, extremists and terrorists used this as an excuse to attack a variety of our embassies, including the one - the consulate in Libya.' That story turned out to be false. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland's emails show that the agency, then headed by Hillary Clinton, had a direct hand in altering the official story on the Benghazi terror attack . Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton testified before Congress that it didn't matter whether the Benghazi assault was a terrorist attack or the result of a protest. 'What difference, at this point, does it make?' she asked . A White House press briefing scheduled for 12:30 p.m. Friday was rescheduled for 1:45 after Press Secretary Jay Carney opted instead to hold a private, off-the-record briefing with 14 journalists. The briefing was later rescheduled again, for 3:15 p.m. President Obama was scheduled to deliver remarks about the Affordable Health Care Act in the East Room of the White House at 2:40 p.m. The briefing, when it occurs, is likely to see an explosion of new questions about Benghazi, but it will be delayed enough to push the resulting news into what journalists call the 'Friday black hole' - the final hours before the weekend when Americans least pay attention to current events.","Sen.

ISIS took the Iraqi cities of Mosul, in Nineveh, and Tikrit in June and has announced an Islamic Caliphate in areas it controls in Iraq and Syria. The news of the police force comes as France launched four airstrikes on northern Iraq killing dozen of ISIS fighters. At the same time car bombs, some of them claimed by Islamic State,  in the majority Kurdish city of Kirkuk in the north killed eight people, security sources said. French President Francois Hollande said fighter jets 'entirely destroyed' the complex in what were France's first airstrikes in Iraq after he agreed to bolster Baghdad's offensive against the insurgency. An Iraq military spokesman said four French airstrikes hit the town of Zumar, killing dozens of extremist fighters. Car bombs, some of them claimed by Islamic State, have been a near daily occurrence in the capital of Iraq Baghdad and elsewhere in the country . President Hollande also added Rafale jets hit 'a logistics depot of the terrorists' near the city of Mosul, which has been held by Islamic State for more than three months. It promised more operations in coming days. The French military action, which follows U.S. air strikes in northern Iraq and near the capital Baghdad, appeared to win qualified endorsement from Iraq's top Shi'ite leader Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani. In a Friday sermon, delivered by one of his aides, the elderly cleric acknowledged Iraq needed foreign help but said Iraq must not become subservient to outside powers. 'Even if Iraq is in need of help from its brothers and friends in fighting black terrorism, maintaining the sovereignty and independence of its decisions is of the highest importance,' Mr Sistani's spokesman Sheikh Abdul Mehdi Karbala'i said.

"Jenson Button’s 15-year Formula One career will end at the final race of the season in Abu Dhabi on November 23. Sportsmail understands that McLaren will bring in double world champion Fernando Alonso to replace the Briton with an announcement imminent. Button, 34, has waited for months in the hope that his rookie team-mate Kevin Magnussen would be the one to make way if Alonso signed but McLaren principal Eric Boullier believes that 22-year-old Magnussen will complement Alonso better than Button. VIDEO Scroll down for Behind the scenes at McLaren through the eyes of Jenson Button . McLaren's Jenson Button is set to wave farewell to Formula One at the end of the current season . Englishman Button won his first race at the Hungarian Grand Prix in 2006 at his 113th attempt . Button won the world title with Brawn in 2009 . An insider said: ‘Eric thinks the drivers must fit together rather than having two No 1 drivers. That is bad news for Jenson.’ Button, who flew into Sao Paulo, Brazil on Wednesday for this weekend’s penultimate race of the season, has said he does not want to move to a lesser team to prolong a career that has yielded 15 victories. He has raced in 264 grands prix, more than any contemporary. Button’s first victory came at the 113th attempt, in Hungary in 2006, and he won the world title with Brawn in 2009 before moving to McLaren. There, he embellished his reputation as a formidable talent, particularly in the wet. He briefly considered whether to stop racing at the start of this season after the death of his father John. He has since worn a pink helmet to recall the colour of the shirt John wore on race days. Button may now follow his friend Mark Webber, the former Red Bull driver, into sports cars and the Le Mans-style World Endurance Championship. Button’s manager Richard Goddard said recently: ‘Jenson is too good to sit at the back of the grid, so if McLaren haven’t got a seat for him, he would look elsewhere.’ Somerset-born Button, aged 34, finished seventh at the US Grand Prix in Austin last weekend .

McLaren opened preliminary talks with Alonso, generally considered the sport’s most complete driver, a year ago and revived their interest when it became apparent that Sebastian Vettel was about to replace the Spaniard at Ferrari. With the other leading teams, Red Bull and Mercedes, having their driver line-ups settled, Alonso had little choice but to plump for McLaren despite the rancorous year he spent there in 2007. He initially sought a one-year deal to give himself an escape route but Boullier insisted on Alonso signing a two-year contract with an option on a third, and that has now been agreed.

"Victim: A court heard that Fico Dougan (pictured) was murdered with a kitchen knife after the defendant said rap music 'made him want to stab somebody' A teenager murdered an acquaintance with a kitchen knife in front of a toddler after saying that rap music made him 'want to stab somebody', a court heard. The 16-year-old, who can not be named for legal reasons, is accused of launching an unprovoked attack on Fico Dougan, 17. The fatal stab wound was inflicted with such force that it entered through his chest, passed through a chest bone and emerged from his back, the Old Bailey heard yesterday. Fico died of a stab wound to the heart soon after the attack on September 25 last year, which took place in front of a two-year-year girl at a house in Croydon, south London, the court was told. The accused teenager's defence barrister argues the killing was triggered by post-traumatic stress disorder following the death of his much-loved brother. Martin Hicks, prosecuting, told the court that the alleged murderer and Fico knew each other but 'there was no known hostility'. The pair had both been at the house of a 19-year-old woman on the afternoon of the killing, and she, the defendant, and Fico's girlfriend Montana Riley were watching television with the woman's two-year-old sister. Mr Hicks said: 'The defendant was listening to music on his headphones. He was heard to say words to the effect of, ""When I listen to rap music I want to stab somebody"".’ Soon after, Fico tapped at the window and was let into the house by Miss Riley and joined the group watching TV, the jury was told. Fewer than ten minutes later, the defendant rose from his seat and walking to the kitchen with what Miss Riley described as 'a vague stare'. Mr Hicks told the court: 'He burst back into the room and he was holding a kitchen knife. Without any warning and with no good reason he proceeded to attack Fico.' The court heard the defendant remained completely silent as he tried to stab Fico at least six times while Miss Riley frantically attempted to stop him. Tragedy: Fico died of a stab wound to the heart soon after the attack in Croydon, south London, on September 25 last year. The defendant had been listening to rap music before Fico died . He fled the house and boarded a bus to his home, where he allegedly tried to set his clothing alight. In footage of a police interview shown to the court, Miss Riley said she had never known the defendant to be violent. She told detectives the teenager had been listening to music on his mobile phone in the hours before the attack. She told them: 'He said, ""When I listen to depressing songs I feel depressed, when I listen to love songs I feel sexually frustrated, and when I listen to rap music I want to stab up someone’s face"". 'He started clenching his fist. I thought it was weird but you don’t think he actually would. He did not look serious.' Family: Tragic Fico with his sister Effeh. Paramedics had battled to save his life but he died in hospital . Miss Riley also recalled her attempts to save Fico’s life. She said: 'He came out of nowhere and leapt over [the 19-year-old woman] to get to Fico. He was just stabbing Fico constantly. I tried to get between them and stop him. 'He looked like he was trying to stab his face so I had my hands over his face and his heart. 'I was trying to talk to Fico and to see if he was breathing but he wasn’t responding. His eyes had rolled back.' Tributes: Flowers and tributes left outside the home where 17-year-old Fico was stabbed . Paramedics battled to save Fico’s life, but he died in hospital. The defendant denies murder. His defence lawyer, David Nathan, will argue for a lesser conviction of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility due to post-traumatic stress disorder. Mr Nathan told the court the defendant’s brother, with whom he was 'very close', had died in the weeks before Fico’s death. The court heard he had drunk a bottle of vodka the night before the killing, leaving him so drunk he threw up. The trial continues.

"China has been accused by the Philippines of reclaiming land on a reef in disputed islands to build an airstrip just days after Washington described Beijing's actions in the region as 'provocative'. If confirmed, the airstrip would be the first built by China on any of the eight reefs and islands it occupies in the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea. It would also mark a significant escalation in tensions involving several nations in the area. China claims almost the entire South China Sea, an area rich in energy deposits and an important passageway traversed each year by $5trillion worth of ship-borne goods. Scroll down for video . Outrage: Vietnamese and Filipino protesters outside the Chinese Consulate at the financial district of Makati city to protest the recent moves by China to construct an oil rig in disputed waters in the South China Sea . Location: If confirmed, the airstrip would be the first built by China on any of the eight reefs and islands it occupies in the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea . Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have claims on the area. Philippine . Foreign ministry spokesman Charles Jose told Reuters that China had . been moving earth and materials to Johnson South Reef, known by the . Chinese as Chigua, in recent weeks. He . said China was reclaiming land in violation of the Declaration on the . Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, an informal code of conduct . for the region. 'They're about to build an airstrip,' Jose said. He said evidence of the Chinese activity on the reef had been shown in aerial photographs taken by the Philippine Navy.

The Philippines and Taiwan already have airstrips in the area. The . ministry had already lodged a protest with the Chinese and raised the . issue behind closed doors at last weekend's summit of the Association of . South East Asian Nations in Myanmar, Jose said. Tensions in the South China Sea were already high after China moved a large oil rig into an area also claimed by Vietnam. Beijing and Hanoi each accused the other of ramming its ships near the disputed Paracel Islands. It . came as Vietnam's prime minister sent a text message to millions of . citizens urging them to act in defense of the country's sovereignty . following China's deployment of the oil rig, but said that 'bad . elements' shouldn't be allowed to engage in violence. The . message, sent late Thursday and Friday to subscribers via major . state-owned cellphone operators, didn't directly condemn the riots that . have broken out this week following China's decision to deploy the rig . off the coast of central Vietnam on May 1.

'The . prime minister requests and calls on every Vietnamese to boost their . patriotism to defend the fatherland's sacred sovereignty with actions in . line with the law,' the text message said. 'Bad elements should not be allowed to instigate extremist actions that harm the interests and image of the country.' There were no reports of any new violence or protests on Friday. Firefighters stand across from the main entrance of Tan Than Industries as the Taiwanese bicycle factory burns, in Di An Town, Binh Duong province, Vietnam . Protesters stand on the corner of a street in Binh Duong province, near Song Than 2 Industrial Park in Vietnam . Vietnam's authoritarian leaders typically clamp down on public protests of any sort, but have allowed them this time. Preventing people from demonstrating would have given fuel to domestic critics of the government who already accuse it of being soft on Beijing. The government is also able to use the nationalist sentiment of its people to amplify its protests to Beijing. But violence that harms foreign investment and risks spinning out of control is unlikely to fit into this strategy, and the government will attempt to ensure that it doesn't break out again, most analysts say. China and Vietnam have tussled for years over competing territorial claims, as have the Philippines and China. But Beijing's desire for oil and gas, and its growing economic and military might, have seen it take an increasingly assertive stance to its claims in the sea, triggering increased tensions and incidents between it and claimant states. The anti-China violence on the streets is only inflaming the relationship further. China said its foreign minister, Wang Yi, called Vietnamese Foreign Minister Pham Binh Minh on Thursday and expressed Beijing's 'strong condemnation and stern protest' over the violence against Chinese and other foreign nationals and businesses. The U.S. doesn't take a side in the disputes, but shares many of the concerns of Vietnam and the Philippines about China. On Tuesday, Kerry said during a phone call with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi that China's introduction of the oil rig and numerous government vessels into the area disputed with Vietnam was 'provocative', a State Department spokeswoman confirmed.","Philippine foreign ministry claims Beijing is building airstrip on disputed reef .

"A Republican candidate running for office in Minnesota is being sued for sawing his neighbor's garage in half. Roger Weber, of Nashwauk, Minnesota, claims he used a power saw to hack through through the building as a reaction to a family feud over land - saying the garage encroached onto his property. He faces a civil trial, and the loss of $40,000, from Mark Besemann, who bought the Nashwauk property in 2013, and shortly found that his garage had been split in two. Hacked in two: Roger Weber, a Republican candidate for the Minnesota House of Representatives, claimed this garage encroaches on his land - then sawed it in half . Trashed: Mark Besemann, who bought a house, and the garage with it, unwittingly stepped into a family feud over where dividing lines should be drawn on the estate of the late Robert Weber . The dispute over the property stretches back to Weber's father, whose will divided his 40-acre estate into two, according to the Duluth News Tribune. Weber - who is running for a seat in the Minnesota House of Representatives - says that he hacked the garage in two because it crossed into his portion of the property. 'My land': Roger Weber, pictured, hopes to be elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives for the GOP - but insists the feud is nothing to do with that . Robert Weber, who died in 2012, used to own the entire estate and all the property - but gave the 39 empty acres to his son in 1978, according to court documents. This left him with one acre of land, a house and the now-split garage. When he died it passed to his daughter, Ann Anderson, who now lives in Arizona. She sold the property to Besemann in April 2013 - but Weber thought it was still hers. He had previously threatened to tear down anything on his side of the dividing line - and when Besemann came to inspect his new purchase he found the structure in ruins. He said: 'It was a pretty rough way to greet your new neighbor... Apparently the property line problem, that the garage might be partially on his acres, wasn’t a problem when his dad lived there. But after I bought it, it became a problem.' There are also reports the septic system in the house has been tampered with, making the house impossible to rent out. Weber has said that Besemann 'knew what he was getting into' when he bought the house - and later batted away questions, saying it is a 'private' matter which has nothing to do with his ambitions for public office. Besemann filed the initial suit in September 2013. He is seeking $20,000 in damages to the garage and another $20,000 punitive damages. The case was to be heard this week in Itasca County District Court, but has been delayed until December 15. Aftermath: The garage is pictured in two piece above shortly after Weber took a power saw to it . Boundaries: Weber has since set up a fence around the disputed land with 'no trespassing' sings on it .","Roger Weber took a power saw to neighbor's garage in Nashwauk, MN .

"Fighting back: Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski has accused Britain of stigmatising Poles who send child benefit home . Poland's foreign minister has lambasted David Cameron for saying European migrants should be banned from sending their child benefits back home. Radoslaw Sikorski accused the Prime Minister of ‘stigmatising’ Poles by singling out the nation’s migrant workers in comments about his proposals to reform EU welfare rules. Mr Sikorski said: ‘If Britain gets our taxpayers, shouldn’t it also pay their benefits? Why should Polish taxpayers subsidise British taxpayers’ children?’ Mr Cameron had said it was ‘wrong’ child benefit is paid to support workers’ families who remain in their home countries. Under EU rules, child benefit has to . be paid to European nationals who are working in Britain and paying . National Insurance – even if their families are based abroad. There are around 24,000 families claiming for 40,000 children, with two-thirds of the children based in Poland. Speaking to BBC1's Andrew Marr show, Mr Cameron said: ‘I don’t think that is right and that is something I want to change.’ He warned stopping the export of benefits across the EU would ‘take time’ because a deal would need to be struck with other member states or wait for the new treaty he hopes to negotiate if he is still Prime Minister after the next election. He said: ‘There are other European countries who like me think it’s wrong that someone from Poland who comes here, who works hard - and I am absolutely all in favour of that - but I don’t think we should be paying child benefit to their family back at home in Poland. Scroll down for video . Attack: Mr Sikorski used Twitter to hit back at David Cameron's idea . ‘Now, to change that, you’ve either . got to change it with other European countries at the moment, or . potentially change it through the treaty change that I’ll be putting in . place before the referendum we will hold on Britain’s membership of the . EU by the end of 2017.’ But today Mr Sikorski hit back, . writing on Twitter: 'If Britain gets our taxpayers, shouldn't it also . pay their benefits? Why should Polish taxpayers subsidise British . taxpayers' children?’ He . added: ‘UK social security rules apply to all resident EU citizens. No . need to stigmatise Poles. What about British children abroad?’ Mr . Cameron made clear that stopping migrant workers in the UK from . claiming child benefit for their offspring back home would be a key . demand of his plans to renegotiate a fresh deal with the EU before . staging an in-out referendum by 2017. Cameron revealed stopping migrant workers in the UK from claiming child benefit for their offspring back home would be a key demand of his plans to renegotiate a fresh deal with the EU . Child benefit is paid at £20.30 a week for the first child and £13.40 for every other child. Since . last year families in the UK with one person earning more than £50,000 . have had their child benefit cut, and removed altogether if one earner . has a salary of more than £60,000. Mr Cameron said that tackling immigration from Europe would also be a key demand of renegotiation talks. ‘My . job is to put in place proper controls so people can’t come here to . claim benefits; to put in proper controls to investigate that people . aren’t being paid less than the minimum wage; to make sure we deal with . illegal immigrants; to make sure if people can’t sustain themselves, . they are removed from our country. All those steps we’ll be taking.’ He said he wanted to change Britain’s relationship with the EU before putting it to a vote in an in-out referendum. He refused to say if he would campaign . to leave the EU if he failed to secure enough concessions, insisting . his renegotiation was ‘doable’. ‘We . need flexibility, we need more competitiveness, we need less costs . added to our small business, we need to fix all these things.’","Cameron said it is wrong European workers in UK can send benefits home .

"The Labour candidate in the crucial Eastleigh by-election said he wished Margaret Thatcher had been murdered in the IRA attack on Brighton’s Grand Hotel. Left-winger John O’Farrell felt  a ‘surge of excitement’ when he heard of the attempted assassination in 1984 and was ‘disappointed’ the terrorists failed. He asked himself repeatedly: ‘Why did she have to leave the bathroom two minutes earlier?’ The bathroom of Lady Thatcher’s suite was wrecked in the explosion. She had been in it shortly before the bomb went off. Laughs: Labour leader Ed Miliband (left) has been told by former Tory chairman Lord Tebbit to disown left-winger John O'Farrell (right) for his comments that he wished Margaret Thatcher had been murdered in an IRA attack . The comments made by Mr O’Farrell, a comedian who wrote gags for Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, appear in his book about his support for Labour, entitled Things Can Only Get Better. Former Tory chairman Lord Tebbit, who was badly injured  in the blast and whose wife, Margaret, was crippled for life, last night called on Labour leader Ed Miliband to disown  Mr O’Farrell, an ‘incontinently voiced moral reprobate’. Writing about Lady Thatcher, Mr O’Farrell said: ‘I would invent all sorts of elaborate scenarios whereby she would cease to be Prime Minister of Britain. Some involved a sombre deputation from the 1922 Committee  [of Tory MPs] and others involved me popping up with a machine-gun at the Conservative Party Conference. ‘In October 1984, when the Brighton . bomb went off,  I felt a surge of excitement at the nearness of her . demise and yet disappointment that such a chance had been missed. 'This . was me – the pacifist, anti-capital punishment, anti-IRA liberal – . wishing that they had got her. “Why did she have to leave the bathroom . two minutes earlier?”  I asked myself over  and over again.’ 'Disappointed': Mr O'Farrell felt a 'surge of excitement' when he heard of the assassination attempt on Lady Thatcher (pictured left at a church service after the attack) at Brighton's Grand Hotel (right) In the same book, published in 1998,  Mr O’Farrell made a similarly provocative statement on calls for Lady Thatcher to be given a state funeral. ‘It would be far more appropriate to allow competitive bids from private companies to run the funeral arrangements: “And we now go over live to Westminster, where .  .  . we see the coffin respectfully borne on the shoulders of six part-time burger-flippers .  .  . before the private cremation when the body will be flame-grilled with gherkins and a slice of cheese.” Now that’s a funeral I would turn out for.’ Five people died in the bomb attack, including Tory MP Sir Anthony Berry and Roberta Wakeham, wife of Tory Cabinet Minister Lord Wakeham. Lord Tebbit told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Ed Miliband should repudiate this incontinently voiced moral reprobate who  tries to excuse murder as a weapon against those who won democratic elections time after time against the rag-bag remnants of a once great  Labour Party.’ Mr O’Farrell also  said he wished Lady Thatcher had lost the Falklands War in 1982,  in which 255 British servicemen died.  ‘I settle on the uncomfortable and convoluted position of wanting Great Britain  to lose the war for the good of Great Britain.  I was against the war, against people’s reaction to the war, even against the outcome of the war.’ A Labour Party spokesman said: ‘John made these comments many years ago and of course does not condone  or wish harm on anyone.’","Writer John O'Farrell made comments in his book about his Labour support .

"The West End is the world’s most expensive place in which to rent office space, research shows. Rising demand saw London overtake Hong Kong last year to become the priciest city once again – and the West End is the dearest place there. Average London rents are now more than double those on New York’s 5th Avenue and the business districts of Paris and Sydney, according to the study. Rising demand has seen London overtake Hong Kong as the most expensive place to rent office space . ‘As a truly global city, London’s appeal continues unabated,’ said Digby Flower, head of London markets at property broker Cushman & Wakefield, which carried out the research. ‘Equally importantly we expect rents to grow further as we get into recovery mode [following recession].’ It is the first time since the financial crash in 2008 that London has regained the global crown. The report said: ‘London has consistently been a sought after location for multinational occupiers deriving from a wide range of business sectors. The West End submarket of London is the most expensive part of the city and is home to many technology, media, advertising and hedge fund companies’. Rents increased sharply towards the end of the year, it added, helping London to leapfrog Hong Kong. Soaring demand from technology companies helped prices rise 2 per cent over the year. Average London rents are double those of the business district of Paris, left, and New York's 5th Avenue, right . It now costs an average of £170 per square foot of office space, including rent, service charges and property taxes. This is 43 per cent more expensive than Hong Kong, which was hampered last year by a slowdown in global banking. Office space there costs an average of £119 per square foot. Brazil’s Rio de Janeiro comes third with an average price of £107 in its Zona Sul (South Zone) area. New York is eighth, charging £84 in Midtown Manhattan. Rents across the UK were more subdued. The second most expensive place in Britain was the Square Mile, at £55, while Manchester was third at £28.50 a square foot.","Rising demands saw London overtake Hong Kong as priciest city .

"Prince Charles has secretly lobbied the Health Secretary to back discredited homeopathic medicines. The Prince and Jeremy Hunt – both strong supporters of alternative therapies – held a meeting at Clarence House last week. Homeopathy and alternative medicines were on the agenda, according to well-placed sources. The NHS already spends millions each year on alternative medicines, at a time when it is restricting life-saving drugs for those with cancer. The Prince, who has long been accused of meddling in Government policy, has found a fellow supporter in homeopathy in Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt (left) - and they met last week to discuss it . Charles is understood to be unhappy that government plans to set up a register of practitioners of herbal and Chinese medicine – designed to give them an element of respectability – have stalled. But a Labour MP accused the Prince of promoting ‘voodoo medicine’ and both the British Medical Association and the Commons science and technology committee say the NHS should stop funding homeopathic treatments because of a lack of evidence they work. The BMA has described homeopathy as ‘witchcraft’, and two weeks ago the Advertising Standards Authority said homeopaths were putting people’s lives at risk by discouraging them from seeking medical treatment. Despite this, Mr Hunt has been outspoken in his support for homeopathy. In 2007 he signed a Commons motion welcoming the ‘positive contribution made to the health of the nation by the NHS homeopathic hospitals’. He has also defended it in a letter to a constituent. The Prince has long been accused of meddling in Government policy. The Prince of Wales with some homeopathic remedies in Poundbury, Dorset in 2004 . It emerged in 2009 that he had written to eight Whitehall departments in three years. Just this month, the High Court blocked Freedom of Information requests for the letters to be published. Labour MP Paul Flynn said that by promoting ‘voodoo medicine’, Charles was putting himself in a ‘very dangerous position’ because as monarch he will have to be impartial. ‘The head of state, which he will soon be, has to remain above controversy. The only serious job of a head of state is to be above policy,’ Mr Flynn said. ‘If he wishes to lobby ministers, he . should stand for Parliament or join a lobbying firm, but he should not . be using his position as heir to the throne to do it. The ASA's assessment of treatments and claims made by the Society of Homeopaths suggested practitioners were offering false hope . ‘There is a danger here for the future of the monarchy, and we have already been denied access to 27 letters he has sent to ministers because they might affect his position as king. ‘If there is any doubt over his suitability to be king, we should know about it. ‘What is worrying is that homeopathy is a completely unscientific form of medicine – it’s voodoo medicine. The pills contain not a single atom of medicine. The Health Secretary should be concentrating on science-based medicine that actually works.’ In 2010, the then Labour Health Minister Mike O’Brien confirmed that Prince Charles had brought up homeopathy in meetings with Andy Burnham, who was then Health Secretary. Of Charles’s meeting with Mr Hunt, Clarence House said: ‘As confirmed in the court circular, the Prince of Wales received the Secretary of State for Health last week. ‘The Prince meets Government ministers from time to time in his role as heir to the throne as well as Privy Counsellor and this was one of those meetings. There was no specific agenda and a wide range of topics were discussed.’ The Department of Health would not confirm what was discussed. But on the issue of the register of herbal medicines, a spokesman said: ‘The regulation of herbalists and traditional Chinese medicine practitioners has been a matter of debate for over ten years. ‘In February 2011 we announced our intention to regulate these practitioners, and since that time we have been working through the issues involved. ‘As a result of the complexity of the outstanding issues, a working group is being established to consider matters relating to patient protection when using unlicensed manufactured herbal products, increasing the use of herbal product licensing to minimise risk to consumers, and to consider how best to ensure these products do not cause harm to consumers. The Society of Homeopaths' website said evidence existed to show homeopathy can treat a wide range of ailments . ‘We must make sure that whatever approach is taken addresses any potential risks to consumers as well as the needs of practitioners.’ Earlier this month, advertising watchdogs ruled that practitioners of homeopathy were putting patients at risk by discouraging them from seeking essential medical treatment. The ASA’s assessment of treatments and claims made by the Society of Homeopaths suggested practitioners were offering false hope and may be causing real harm. The Society’s website said evidence existed to show homeopathy can treat a wide range of ailments. But the ASA tested a series of statements and found there was insufficient evidence to support the claimed benefits. It said several conditions – including bronchitis, osteoarthritis and vertigo – required medical supervision and patients should not rely on homeopathy. Evidence supplied by the Society to support its claims was not strong enough and ‘misleading’. The ASA warned the society to stop making claims that are not supported by good evidence. Society chairman Diane Goodwin insisted that evidence did exist for the benefits of homeopathy, but that the society was prepared to change the way it marketed treatments.","Pair - both supporters of alternative therapies - met last week .

"John Robert Reeves, 25, had expressed his feelings on blogs since 2004 . Memorial service held for brother and sister who were shot dead . A Navy pilot who killed himself and three others had been posting troubled messages online for years, saying he would 'unintentionally screw people over'. John Robert Reeves, 25, reportedly committed suicide by shooting himself in the head after murdering three . others with him - fellow Navy pilot David Reis, 25, his sister Karen . Reis, 24, and Matthew Saturley, 31. The four dead were found in Coronado, . California, after authorities responded to a report of gunfire around 2am last Sunday. Deeply troubled: John Robert Reeves allegedly killed three people in California before turning the gun on himself. He had been posting distressed messages online since 2004 . Reeves had taken part in online discussion groups since 2004, according to 10News.com, posting comments such as: 'I might come across as a nice guy, but I unintentionally screw people over on a regular basis.' The . motive for the shooting has not been revealed but authorities suggested . it could have been motivated by jealousy. Results from an autopsy were . not yet available to see if drugs or alcohol might have been involved. Speaking about Reeves, clinical psychologist Dr. Michael Mantell told the station: 'There is a man who is hurting, who is in emotional turmoil. There's a storm brewing in him.' Hundreds of people gathered at a ceremony on Friday to remember the brother and sister who were killed. David Reis was remembered by friends, family and others at a high school as an avid hiker and Navy pilot with a promising career, according to The  Bakersfield Californian newspaper. Karen Reis was said to be a great role model and volleyball coach who hoped to become an occupational therapist. At the end of the service, hundreds of coloured balloons were released into the sky. Confirmed dead: Tom Reis said on Monday that his son David, left, and daughter Karen, right, were confirmed as victims by the Navy . Reeves and David Reis were both . training as F/A-18 fighter pilots assigned to the Marine Fighter Attack . Training Squadron 101 of the Third Marine Aircraft Wing at nearby . Miramar Air Station. Officials . say they do not know the motive for the killing, but are investigating . the possibility that Reeves had romantic feelings for, or a relationship . with, Ms Reis. 'We are looking into all aspects, including the possibility there was . some type of relationship between Karen Reis and John Reeves but that . has not been confirmed yet,' said sheriff's captain Duncan Fraser. Mr Fraser cautioned that investigators might never determine the motive . because there were no eyewitnesses to the shooting.

He said the suggestion that Reeves was jealous of the attention being paid to Ms Reis by Mr Saturley was only speculation. Retired Naval pilot Steve Diamond said the case was shocking because it involved such high achievers. Mr Diamond said: 'The . first thing that most people think of even within the Navy community is . how could such an enormously tragic thing happen involving people who . are the cream of the crop, highly trained, highly educated, national . assets basically.' It . takes years of training to get one's wings as a Navy pilot, and . fighter-jet pilots are considered to be among the top in that group.

"The father and step-mother of a 13-year-old boy held captive inside a false wall appeared in court this morning to answer charges of child cruelty. Gregory Jean, 37, and Samantha Joy Davis, 42, are both charged with the false imprisonment and cruelty against his son at their home in Jonesboro, a suburb of Atlanta, Georgia. The  boy went missing four years ago, when he went to visit his father in Georgia. He was found this weekend after downloaded a texting app on his phone to reach out to his mother in Florida, writing that he had been beaten by his father. Davis is accused of striking the youngster with a stick causing him physical harm and imprisoning him in a hidden section of a garage at the family home. Jean Senior is accused of cruelty towards his son - that is parental neglect by failing to  protect his son from physical violence and imprisoning the boy in an attic section of the garage. Scroll down for video . Captors: Father Gregory Jean, 37 (left), and stepmother Samantha Joy Davis, 42 (right), appeared in court Sunday morning on charges of false imprisonment, obstruction and cruelty to a child after Jean's son was found hidden behind a linen closet at their home. Three other minors were also arrested at the house where the  boy was found . Reunited: This  13-year-old  boy is pictured being reunited with his Florida-based mother after he was found imprisoned behind a false wall in the linen closet of his father's Georgia home four years after going missing . Davis spoke only to answer her name and appeared downcast as she sat in court in green county jail clothes. Jean Senior appeared more forthright and told the court he was originally from Haiti but was now a U.S. citizen. He works for TV cable company Comcast, he told the court. He was wearing the Clayton County jail regulation orange fatigues. Judge Richard Brown refused both suspects bail and they were remanded to Clayton County Jail until their next appearance on December 9th. First appearance: Jean (left) and David (right) take the stand in Clayton County, Georgia court on Sunday. They were remanded . Neighbors in the Atlanta, Georgia suburb where a 13-year-old was found living behind a linen closet on Saturday, have spoken out to say they saw the boy often and never knew he was being held against his will. Jean's neighbor's in the Atlanta suburb of  Jonesboro were shocked to hear that the boy was a prisoner. They say they often saw him outside the house, sometimes doing yard work. 'It was a shock to all of us. They were really nice people, very open they said come over anytime you want,' neighbor Julie Pizarro, who lives across the street told WXIA. 'The young man didn't seem under any distress. I guess you never know what's behind closed doors.' 'Gosh, it was right under our nose,' neighbor Akono Ekundayo said. 'We could have done something.' The boy was reported missing to child welfare authorities in 2010 after he went to visit his father and he refused to return him to his mother, according to WSB-TV. However, his mother never contacted the police, potentially because she is an immigrant and was unfamiliar with the system, it is said. But after receiving her son's text this weekend, she immediately called 911. Following her call, officers arrived at Jean's home at 2am on Saturday. They reportedly questioned the house's uncooperative occupants for several minutes before locating the victim in a linen closet in the garage. The boy repeatedly thanked officers for rescuing him, according to reports. In heart-wrenching scenes on Saturday morning, the victim was pictured clinging on to his weeping mother, who had traveled to Georgia, as another female relative sobbed uncontrollably nearby in an emotional reunion. Sargent Joanne Southerland, of Clayton County Police Department, told the news station: 'We came here to the home and were able to get inside and talk to the people inside. 'After several minutes of denying that the child was here and that there was ever any assault or anything like that, we were able to find him in the linen closet.' Arrests: The boy went missing in 2010, when he went to see his father and never returned. His mother allegedly never informed police since she is an immigrant and unfamiliar with the system. Above, the house where he was held captive . No clue: Neighbors in the Jonesboro neighborhood said they often saw the boy outside the house, and never thought he was being held prisoner . Investigation: CID officers are pictured arriving at the house on Saturday morning. An investigation is ongoing . Officer Daniel Day added: 'I just couldn't believe it. We found him, we saw him. To say it was a great feeling is an understatement. He just couldn't thank us enough, he was overjoyed we had found him.' Police have now requested a search warrant for the property. A spokesman said they still have a lot of unanswered questions, including how the boy was imprisoned for so long without intervention. The boy, whose legal custody is believed to lie with his mother, is expected to remain under the protection of the Division of Family and Children Services for the next couple of days. An investigation is ongoing. Proud: Police Chief Greg Porter (left) said: 'The police department did an excellent job coming out here and responding to the 911 emergency call.'

"Authorities say a University of Richmond student shot and killed late Wednesday night appears to have been the target of a mysterious homicide plot, despite being described as a friendly teen with straight-A grades. Brendan Tevlin, 19, of Livingston, New Jersey, was home for the summer after his freshman year of college when police discovered his body riddled with bullets in the seat of a Jeep Liberty in the parking lot of an apartment building. West Orange police found him in the area - around six miles from his family home - after responding to a report of shots fired. Earlier in the night, the 'model' student texted his mother to say he was traveling home from a friend's house. Tributes: Friends and family say Tevlin was active in sports and charity work and described him as an outgoing teen with no enemies . Mystery: Police discovered the crime scene after responding to a report of shots fired late Wednesday . 'At this juncture of the investigation it does not appear to be random,' Anthony Ambrose,  the chief of . detectives for the Essex County Prosecutor’s Office, told The Star-Ledger. Ambrose's homicide and major crimes task force is investigating. He could not comment on potential motives or identify potential suspects as the investigation is ongoing. No arrests have been made. An unidentified friend told NJ.com the Jeep Tevlin was found in belonged to a family member. Before his death, Tevlin had been at a friend's house playing video games and texted his mother to say he was coming home. 'We’re literally just reeling in this tragedy,' the friend told the website. She added that the family had been interviewed by detectives but were still at a loss for a possible motive. Friendly guy: Brendan Tevlin, seen here with two unidentified friends, was a well-liked student who friends say avoided controversial issues . Killed: The body of Brendan Tevlin, 19, was found shot multiple times late Wednesday in a Jeep . 'This is so out of character. He was literally a good kid. No enemies — he always avoided controversy,' she said. 'The world lost a terrific kid.' The oldest of four children, family and friends described him as a kind person with a sociable personality. 'People need to know what kind of person he was,' said Christian Breslin, who played on the lacrosse team with Tevlin at Seton Hall. 'This kid, . there was nothing bad about him. He was one of the nicest people I’ve . ever known.' The prep school's head, Monsignor Michael Kelly, said the entire school was grieving. 'Brendan was a wonderful young man, friend of everyone, liked by . all,' he wrote in a news release. 'Our community is praying for the . family and his grandparents, who were very close to Brendan and to Seton . Hall Prep.' Crime scene: Police have yet to make an arrest in the case but say it appears to have been a planned shooting at the apartment complex in West Orange, New Jersey . During his four years at the school he also volunteered for Knights of Setonia, a community service group. Ed Ayers, school president of the University of Richmond, said he had planned a business major and was active in sports. Dozens expressed their grief on Twitter after hearing the news. 'You were a great friend and brother to many,' wrote one user. Another wrote: 'Brendan Tevlin was everything that was right in this world, and the . monster that took his life is everything that’s wrong with it. RIP.'

"Less than 24 hours after he was officially named, so-called ‘cybersquatters’ are already trying to cash in on HRH Prince George of Cambridge. More than 178 ‘domain names’ connected to the new royal baby were seized by opportunists within hours of the announcement by Kensington Palace on Wednesday evening. In simplistic terms, a domain name is the name for a website and it is what users will type into an internet search engine to get to your website. Announcement: Opportunistic 'cybersquatters' waited on tenterhooks for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge (pictured) to reveal their baby's name . According to names.co.uk, one of the UK’s top domain name registrars, the first was by a Portuguese domain-name broker who registered the web address GeorgeAlexanderLouis.com moments after Prince William and Kate revealed the name of their new-born son.

'Cybersquatters sometimes offer to sell the domain to the person or company who owns a trademark at an inflated price.’ Business: The commercial reaction to the Royal baby has been far-reaching.

"A Hazmat team rushed on to a plane from Philadelphia in the Dominican Republic after a man sneezed and yelled: 'I have Ebola!' The American passenger, who does not have Ebola, was detained by four officers and taken to the airport's medical center in Punta Cana as he declared: 'I ain't from Africa'. The remaining 255 people were forced to stay on board for two hours until he was cleared, despite airline staff insisting they believed it was a poor-taste joke. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Warning: A flight attendant warned passengers an 'idiot' had provoked them to call a Hazmat team on board . Fears: Passengers on the US Airways flight from Philadelphia covered their faces as the officers investigated . Detained: This is the man that sneezed and yelled 'I have Ebola!' as the four-hour flight neared Punta Cana . The incident on Wednesday came as the White House agreed to step up medical screening at hospitals across the nation after the first man diagnosed of Ebola in the US died. Clad in blue protective overalls, four officers boarded the plane as passengers sat near the man covered their faces. The man had reportedly been sneezing and coughing through the four-hour US Airways flight - an early sign of the often fatal disease. A video taken by one of the passengers in the middle of the Boeing 777 shows passengers standing up ready to leave before a flight attendant on a speakerphone tells everyone to sit down. Emergency measures: Security has been stepped up on American airlines after Thomas Eric Duncan brought Ebola to Dallas, Texas, from Liberia. He has since died and 10 people in touch with him are being monitored . Taking no chances: Officials conceded that the incident seemed to be a hoax but they couldn't take a chance . Questions: The 'unbalanced' man made the 'poor-taste joke' for attention, officials deduced in an interview . Lengthy: The four Hazmat officers are videoed carefully ascertaining which passenger made the joke . Ordered: He is then ordered out of his seat and taken for further questions and medical tests . She then started by explaining that 'after 30 years in the business' she is sure 'this man is an idiot'. However, a team would be boarding the plane that 'looks scarier than it is'. People filming the incident on their phones shouted 'boo!' at the unnamed passenger as he was forced to stand and remove his luggage from the overhead compartment before being escorted off the plane. He then underwent intensive medical checks and interviews with airport officials to determine that he had been joking. 'I ain't from Africa': The unnamed man is booed by his fellow passengers as he is escorted off the plane . Hoax: His passport shows no signs of being in or near Africa, and the closest he came was a trip to Europe . Waiting: His fellow passengers were forced to wait on board for two hours until he was cleared . 'It was a false alarm set off by the passenger who is slightly unbalanced,' Alberto Smith, director of operations at Punta Cana Airport, told Acento.com.do. He did not elaborate on what he meant by 'unbalanced'. He added that the passenger 'did it for attention', and explained: 'His passport does not show any recent trips to Africa. The closest he came to the continent was in 2012 when he visited Europe.' Measures: Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic now follows CDC guidelines in a bid to ward off the disease . Walter Zemialkowski, director of terminals and maintenance at the airport, said the passenger is believed to have the flu. Ten people, including seven healthcare workers and three family members, are considered at high risk for Ebola after they were exposed to Thomas Eric Duncan - the first US Ebola victim to be diagnosed in the country and die - after he became contagious. Another 38 more are being monitors by the CDC for possible risk of the disease.","Man sneezed, yelled 'I have Ebola!' on US flight to Dominican Republic .

"Whether its champagne, a private island or a Gary Barlow impersonator, sisters Tiffany Wright, 34, and Amanda Brown, 44, know how to make the perfect first date happen. The sisters, both from London, set up their The One Romance planning business two months ago and say it all came about following a dinner party conversation. Since then, they have put together everything from romantic picnics to beaches strewn with loving messages in a bottle for their clients. Tiffany (right) set up The One Romance with her sister Amanda (left) and says that the pair are very close . ‘It all started a few years ago when Amanda and I were at a dinner party in Chelsea one evening with some friends,' explains Tiffany. ‘The following day was the first wedding anniversary of the couple who were hosting the evening and at the end of the dinner the host stood up and said he wanted to give his wife her anniversary present – and whipped out a pair of keys. ‘Everyone around the table presumed he had bought her a car and dashed to the window to look outside. But what did we see? A sit on lawn-mower! 'It was at that moment we realised that some people really do just need a bit of help when it comes to romance.’ ‘After the 'lawnmower incident', everyone around the table started chatting about the most unromantic things their husbands had done and Amanda and I found ourselves giving suggestions. ‘At the end of the party, we had 22 business cards in our hands from husbands who wanted our help. Tiffany and Amanda enjoy a glass of champagne, Tiffany says they will often entertain clients in high end places such as Soho House . 'We now have the business cards framed, with our logo above, hanging in our office. It reminds us of how it all started.’ The sisters combined their experience of proposal planning (Tiffany) and production (Amanda) to set up the business, which has gone from strength-to-strength. 'When people plan something romantic they are often nervous, so seeing a smiling face is always important to them,' explains Tiffany. 'You also have to be incredibly creative. One of our guarantees is that we will never arrange the same romantic experience twice. ‘In terms of our roles, I would say I am the ‘creative’ one. I come up with all of the ideas but sometimes I can get a bit carried away and Amanda has rein me in. 'She’s more organised than me so she makes sure everything goes off without a hitch!' Her favourite moments are many, although one - a first wedding anniversary surprise - stands out. 'We recently planned a gorgeous first wedding anniversary surprise for one couple,' she smiles. 'They came from London but used to visit Devon quite a lot so on their  anniversary they headed to the coast for a romantic weekend. ‘On the Saturday afternoon, the husband suggested they go for a walk along the beach. There his wife kept stumbling across bottles in the sand with messages in them. 'Each message was a love note and in the last bottle there was a map to a personalised picnic we had set up for them. ‘Around the picnic were reasons he loved her and promises he wanted to make to her. The food was the same food that had been served at their wedding – that was a big challenge! Tiffany and Amanda helped one client leave love notes in bottles down a beach in Devon for his wife . Tiffany said that sourcing the food for their picnic - what they had eaten at their wedding - was a bit of a challenge! ‘While they were having their picnic, Amanda and I were back at their house unveiling his anniversary gift to her - a huge marble table top, engraved with the signatures of all the guests who had been at their wedding. His wife was totally speechless when she saw it.’ Successes like that, says Tiffany, are all the result of planning. ‘We always try and meet with clients face to face as we feel that’s important,' she explains. 'We will usually meet somewhere glamorous like Soho House or Claridges. Although we’re happy to travel outside of London if that’s where they’re based. ‘We try to find out as much as we can about their partner - from their likes and dislikes, to the type of person they are - sometimes we even ask for their Facebook and Twitter accounts so we can check them out for ourselves! Gorgeous love notes are just one of the things Tiffany and Amanda help their clients set up . ‘Once we have found out as much as we can, we then go away and come up with two personalised ideas. 'When we give the ideas back to the guy (complete with mood boards so he can really envisage what its about) it’s up to him if he wants to plan it himself or if we wants us to do it. 'If we end up planning the whole experience then we still work with him throughout to make sure it is perfect for his partner. ‘Most of our client's partners want to meet us after the event and in some cases we have become lifelong friends,' she continues. 'Just because a guy hires romance planners, it doesn’t mean he hasn’t put any effort in. In fact, we really force our men to contribute as much as possible. 'He needs to know his girlfriend really well if we are to plan something perfect for her - that way he gets to take loads of credit too.’ When Piers decided that he wanted more from his 18 year friendship with his pal Bella, he called on Tiffany and Amanda to organise what can only be described as the most over the top date ever. Not only did he hire a Bentley to pick her up from her home in London to take her to the coast, he hired out an entire island for her and organised performances from a Gary Barlow impersonator (he's Bella's favourite performer) and a burlesque dancer. Piers hired out Spitbank Fort for his date with Bella as she had always wanted to be stranded on an island with her perfect man . Luckily Piers and Bella's date went well and they are now a very happy couple . At the end of his date he even revealed that he would soon be not only taking her to dinner at Claridges, one of London's finest restaurants, but he'd booked the pair of them a trip to Paris. According to Tiffany all of his (and their!) hard work paid off and the couple are now happily together. In fact Bella described the first date as having been, 'out of this world.'","Sisters Tiffany Wright and Amanda Brown set up The One Romance .

"Teen lovers dubbed 'Romeo and Juliet' have been banned from seeing each other and must wear electronic monitors on their ankles after they ran away from home.

The star-crossed lovers from Clare ran away on August 26 after their parents expressed concern about their six-month romance. They were found safe on Sunday - two weeks later - near Chicago. Neither of the teens spoke during a court hearing on Monday but their families appealed for privacy after the appearance. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

We do want to thank everybody, but we would appreciate the . privacy.' Chuck Foreman, . whose non-profit missing children search organization had been helping . in the hunt for the teens, told The Huffington Post that the couple were . found by a Good Samaritan who spotted their broken-down Ford Explorer. 'In the area they were found in, for being young kids, it was a very dangerous area. They are very fortunate,' Foreman said. It's not clear if the teens will face any criminal charges. They are scheduled to appear in court again next month. The missing Michigan teenagers were discovered safe in Chicago on Sunday with Braxton's mother's 2005 SUV. Star-crossed: Jayden, right, and  Braxton, were found safe on Sunday near Chicago . The . two young lovers were spotted at a gas station near to Wrigley Firled . and an anonymous caller informed the Chicago police who arrived to find . the teens in the back of the vehicle in a parking lot adjacent to the . station. Sgt. Tim Edeling of the Chicago police department told ABC News that the SUV battery was dead and the pair had run out of gas. Private . investigator, Michael Cook, said that the young teenagers had been . living in the car for nearly two weeks after they fled with only $80 . between them. Police did not issue an Amber Alert as they believed Wood and Thomas had runaway together. Sgt. Edeling said the teens told him they had been 'going to the local Starbucks and enjoying our lakefront'. However . Chicago police are trying to gather more information on how the two . managed to financially support themselves since they left Clare. They also want to know what they were were doing in Chicago.

You don't know what to do, where to go or who to call' Inside . the SUV, police discovered suitcases belonging to the two, indicating . that Wood and Thomas had indeed planned their escape. The Isabella County Sheriff's Department . said Jayden and Braxton were last seen on Monday, August 26, in Clare, Michigan. Braxton took his mother's Ford Explorer. Then . for two weeks, neither family heard anything from them. Both sets of . parents said the young couple's relationship had grown too serious too . soon. They were said to . have been very upset at the news they would be going to different . Michigan high schools, which they would have started this week. Jayden's mother also revealed that she told her daughter she no longer supported the six-month relationship. Kelly Drinkwine said before the kids were found: 'It's like they fell off the face of the earth. No one can find them. 'She wrote a message for me in lipstick on the mirror saying, ""I love you so much, stay happy and beautiful."" Scared: Jayden's mother Kelly Drinkwine, pictured, said: 'It's like they fell off the face of the earth. No one can find them. They are two babies trying to take on the world. There are mean, horrible people out there' Broke: The teens only had approximately $80, a video game console, a coin collection and other items that could be sold for cash . 'They . are two babies trying to take on the world. There are mean, horrible . people out there. Just come home, baby. Just come home.' She said their six-month relationship was too serious and Jayden said she could not live without Braxton. 'That's when I felt I had to bring my daughter back to reality. The day . she left I told her I no longer supported their relationship.' Brandon's father Ed Wood told  WZZM13: 'It's like a nightmare. You don't know what to do, where to go or who to call.' Braxton's mother, Sarah Kiley, said: 'They can't live on their own. They are 13 and 14 years old. They didn't want to do anything but be with each other. It was pretty intense for a 14-year-old. Kiley added to ABC: 'We . looked around the house and realized Braxton was missing and we still . didn't comprehend it because Braxton hasn't had driver's training. He is . a young 14, so no drivers' experience whatsoever.' Missing: The missing posters circulated around the area for the teens who were missing for two weeks . She said she became concerned when the two of them started alienating friends so they could spend all their time together. 'They . didn't want to hang out with friends. Their focus was each other and . that's pretty intense for 14-year-olds,' Kiley said, adding that her son . did not take the news they were going to different high schools very . well. 'Braxton told us he was heartbroken. We thought that they had cooled and were not seeing each other anymore,' she said. Their parents believe they only had approximately $80, a video game console, a coin collection and other items that could be sold for cash. West Michigan private eye Mike Cook was part of the team trying to find the teenagers. 'Trying to find these two has been a little bit more difficult than any of us would have thought,' he said before they were finally discovered. 'They are 13 and 14-years-old, boyfriend and girlfriend. It's our impression they have not made contact with anyone. He warned that the teens may start 'doing things you don't want to see kids do to make money'.","Jayden Thomas, 13, and Braxton Wood, 14, found living in SUV near the lake front of Chicago on Sunday morning .

The London Mayor will take advantage of Mr Cameron’s latest foreign trip – three days in India –  to join the Eastleigh by-election campaign in a bid to revive the flagging Tory vote in the UK. Rebel Conservative MPs plan to reopen the question of Mr Cameron’s leadership if, as many Tories privately fear, they do badly in Eastleigh, where disgraced former Lib Dem Cabinet Minister Chris Huhne was forced to resign. 'Masterplan': Boris Johnson's hopes to become Tory leader were reveal last night as he prepared to use the Eastleigh by-election this week to upstage globetrotting David Cameron . The latest episode in the lifelong . rivalry between Mr Cameron and Mr Johnson came as The Mail on Sunday . learned that the London Mayor’s camp have devised a new plan for him to . take  control of the Tory Party. Under their proposal, if Mr Cameron loses the General Election, due in 2015, and resigns, Mr Johnson will allow a ‘caretaker’ leader – possibly Home Secretary Theresa May, chairman Grant Shapps or Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt – to take control and clear up the aftermath of the election defeat. Mr Johnson hopes to return to the Commons in 2017, ask the ‘caretaker’ to step down and lead the Tories to victory in 2020. Rebel Conservative MPs plan to question leadership if they do badly in Eastleigh, where disgraced former MP Chris Huhne was forced to resign . Mr Johnson’s allies say he has ruled . out plans to return to the Commons before 2015 on the grounds that he . would be accused of undermining  Mr Cameron. ‘He . is terrified of falling into the Heseltine trap,’ said a prominent . Johnson supporter, a reference to Michael Heseltine, whose ambition  to . succeed Margaret Thatcher was destroyed by claims that he had betrayed . her. Lord Heseltine’s plan to force her out succeeded in 1990, but the Tory crown was snatched from his grasp by John Major, who lacked Heseltine’s charisma, but who had stayed loyal  to Maggie. Mr Johnson’s allies say the only circumstances whereby he would return to Parliament before 2015 would be ‘if we [the Tories] are so far behind in the polls that even Cameron begged him to come back to save them’. Mr Johnson’s army of Tory fans are hoping Conservatives will turn out in force as he visits Eastleigh on Wednesday to boost his ambition to take over the party. Mr Cameron will be 5,000 miles away in India, trying to drum up trade with the UK. When Mr Johnson visited India last year, he was mobbed in the street by enthusiastic locals and made front-page news in the UK. If Mr Cameron fails to make a similar impact, while Mr Johnson is mobbed in leafy Eastleigh, comparisons are bound to be drawn between the appeal of the two. Tory whips have told No  10 that rebel MPs are planning new attacks on  Mr Cameron if the party loses in Eastleigh. ‘With Lib Dem support at a pathetic nine per cent nationally,  if we cannot win Eastleigh – where Labour is non-existent – we are not going to win a General Election,’ said one MP. Indian impact: When Mr Johnson visited India last year, he was mobbed in the street by enthusiastic locals and made front page news in the UK . The Mail on Sunday disclosed last month how Windsor Tory MP Adam Afriyie, backed by up to 20 Conservative MPs, is planning his own leadership campaign. Undeterred by widespread derision, allies of ambitious Mr Afriyie are said to have drawn up a ‘Matrix’ which lists all Tory MPs and how  to persuade them to join an anti-Cameron coup. One MP who claims to have seen the ‘Matrix’ said: ‘It lists every  Tory MP with a grudge against  Cameron, whether they have been sacked or overlooked by him, and any other grievance.’ Other sources claim that rebel Tories are making separate plans for a ‘post-Cameron’ leadership  contest by drawing up a list of 250 MPs who would be left if the party is badly beaten in 2015. They are using the list to calculate which of the current potential leadership candidates would have most support from a defeated Tory ‘rump’. Mr Johnson was unavailable for comment last night. Tony Blair famously heralded the era of ‘cool Britannia’ with a cocktail party for Britpop stars. A few years later, Gordon Brown let slip that he had a penchant for achingly trendy bands Arctic Monkeys and Coldplay. Now David Cameron has gone one better by allying himself with Britain’s biggest boy band, One Direction, and securing a guest appearance in their latest video. Looking somewhat overwhelmed – and a little older than the average ‘1D’ fan – the Prime Minister posed on the steps of No 10 with the members of the group – Niall Horan, Zayn Malik, Harry Styles, Louis Tomlinson and Liam Payne – to publicise their charity single One Way Or Another (Teenage Kicks). The clip featuring Mr Cameron will form part of the video for the song, a hybrid of 1978 tracks by Blondie and The Undertones, which is the official single for this year’s Comic Relief campaign. While it is believed to be the first time a serving Prime Minister has appeared in a pop video, Mr Cameron has shown his interest in contemporary music before. Last October, London Mayor Boris Johnson told the Tory Party conference he had danced to Korean rapper Psy’s single Gangnam Style with Mr Cameron.

"The Beatles famously sung about a psychedelic fantasy Yellow Submarine in the 1960s. With the potential to be slightly more dangerous, but just as colourful, the Iranian Navy has been showcasing the latest addition to its fleet - a brilliant bright turquoise blue submarine.

But it's hard to believe that the enemy won't see this one coming with the colour making it stand out like a sore thumb against the water's surface. The Navy was showing off the eye-catching creation, which is around the size of a frigate, on Iran state television yesterday. Navy officials, rather conservatively dressed in plain dark uniforms compared to their dazzling ship, watched as the Sina-7, equipped with anti-ship missiles, was launched at Bandar Abbas, near the strategic Strait of Hormuz. Two new Iranian-built Ghadir subs and two repaired hovercraft were also delivered to the Navy.

Iran has sought to upgrade its air defense and naval capabilities, saying any possible future attacks on it would come from the air and sea. The country now claims to be 'self sufficient' in terms of supplying equipment to meet its military needs.

"A shocking video has emerged which appears to show the racially motivated bullying of a three-year-old white girl by her five-year-old black neighbors. Two clips uploaded to Facebook and entitled 'When white people pi** black people off', show a heartbreaking scene - a little Minneapolis girl trying to play with another group of girls who are encouraged to hit, push and verbally abuse the toddler at the encouragement of an older boy off camera. Outraged viewers quickly seized upon the videos as evidence of racism and unleashed a torrent of threatening calls at the parents of the bullying children - who had no idea the incident had been filmed, let alone posted online and rushed to apologize to the equally clueless parents of the victim. Scroll Down for Video . Bullied: The three-year-old toddler has her own hands used to hit herself in this grab from the video shot by the other girls 12-year-old brother . In the video's, which have been watched with horror by over 250,000 people, a little girl is seen sitting on a plastic bike as two older girls yell, 'you ugly' at her. Identified as Mackenzie Peterson, the toddler, who is sitting on her small tricycle  is seemingly spat at by one of the girls, who has been indentified as being a neighbor and five-years-old. Another girl grabs Mackenzie's hand and begins to hit her with it. 'Why you hitting yourself? Why you hitting yourself', the older boy filming, identified as the 12-year-old brother of the girls, asks. Watch Video Here: . Shocking: Little Mackenzie Peterson is treated mercilessly by the other girls who throw the toy she selflessly offered them away onto the ground (right) Beginning to cry loudly, the bullies leave the toddler in the middle of the street in her tricycle and another clip shows the girl off her trike and still attempting to play as one of the girls says 'hit her hard and slap her head like this.' In a wrenching scene, little Mackenzie attempts to share a toy with one of the older girls, but the older boy interrupts and tells her to 'throw it on the ground' - which she does, causing the girl to cry and run to pick it up. United in Disgust: 'Eddie' - the father of the bullying children and Shawn Peterson, the father of three-year-old Mackenzie, the victim, are dealing with the problem themselves and deny that there is anything more going on . But as the three-year-old bends down to pick the toy up the other girls rush over to hit her. Initially, the video was traced to a Facebook page for someone named Ray Wright, but that page has now been taken down and since revealed to be a fake account set up by the 12-year-old boy. While the video mentions the race of all the parties involved, at no point is any racial language used by the bullies towards the little girl. However, the problems began when the video began to spread virally across the Internet, leading to the parents of both children being identified. Upset: Eddie said that he has no idea where his children learned to behave in that manner and he says the appropriate punishment has been taken against them for their actions . Shocked and angered people began to make threatening calls to the father of the 12-year-old and younger girls, who has been identified by the MailOnline as 'Eddie' to protect his identity. Viewing the video for himself, Eddie walked across to his neighbor Shawn Peterson to explain and apologize for his children bullying his daughter, which he had no idea about. 'I wasn't happy with the video, obviously,' said Mackenzie's father, Shawn Peterson, to MyFoxTwinCities. 'I am disgusted with it.' Explaining that the first he heard that hundreds of thousands of people had seen his daughter being bullied on the Internet was when Eddie told him, Shawn said that he trusted his neighbor to do the right thing. 'He's taking care of it. Trust me,' Shawn told FOX 9. 'He's a good father and everything like that, so I'm not worried about what he's doing over there.' Refuting claims online from outraged viewers that his children were racially bullying Mackenzie Peterson, Eddie said that is not what his children are brought up to think. 'I honestly don't know where it comes from. We don't teach that in our household,' Eddie, the father of the girls involved, said. 'We're not racist, none of that.' Eddie and Shawn said that their children usually play together and added that the incident had been blown out of all proportion. Under Control: Shawn Peterson sits on the stoop of his Minneapolis home with his daughter Mackenzie and says that he is satisfied his neighbor, 'Eddie' has disciplined his children for bullying his . 'She's not that way. You can see she's -- they're -- clearly getting coached through the whole situation,' said Eddie about his five-year-old girl. 'When I saw it, I was disgusted with the video -- very disgusted.' Eddie said that his 12-year-old son was being disciplined for his role in the affair, with his Internet and television privileges being taken away. And while both father's have said that the matter is in hand, police did confirm they stopped by to check on the situation, but left satisfied there was no larger issue.","Three-year-old girl on tricycle is videoed while two other slightly older girls hit and verbally abuse her .

"Guardian newspaper editor Alan Rusbridger, whose decision to publish Snowden's stolen files has been criticised . In Whitehall, the publication of the documents stolen by Edward Snowden is considered to have done more damage to the security services than any other event in history. Feted as a hero by The Guardian, Snowden said he wanted to start a public debate on the widespread use of eavesdropping techniques by GCHQ and his former employer, the US National Security Agency (NSA). But security officials are adamant there was no public interest in publishing top-secret information which details the precise methods used by agents to track terrorist plots. They argue that – by pointing out which internet service providers, phone companies and other technology firms can be effectively monitored by GCHQ – fanatics were signposted to the places they should avoid when communicating. GCHQ, in Cheltenham, is the organisation which gathers intelligence for both MI5 and MI6 – if it is compromised, so is the entire security apparatus of the country. One Government official said that, in effect, The Guardian had helped to produce a ‘handbook’ for terrorists. The internet is now rich with websites, based on the newspaper’s revelations, that explain the best way to communicate, while avoiding detection. Whitehall insiders are scornful of the idea that The Guardian and Snowden – who is now holed up in Russia, after a whistle-stop visit to the Chinese territory of Hong Kong – needed to start a debate on State surveillance. They point out that, for years, controversy has raged over (so far unsuccessful) attempts to give the security services and police more powers to spy on emails and internet visits, via the so-called snoopers’ charter. GCHQ Headquarters. Thousands of classified documents about the NSA and GCHQ were published by The Guardian . Exile: Edward Snowden during a press conference he gave in Sheremetyevo airport, Moscow. He has sought sanctuary in Russia . There is also anger at the depiction of . Snowden as a ‘whistle-blower’ by The Guardian. He downloaded files . indiscriminately, not knowing what they contained. But what most disturbs security officials is the knowledge that there are thousands more documents still in the possession of The Guardian, which – despite being warned of the grave threat to national security – continues to publish Snowden’s material. Former NSA employee Edward Snowden. Some of the information was so sensitive that British agents had to be moved for their own safety . It is also highly likely that China and Russia hold the information, given Snowden’s attempts to seek sanctuary there. In August, Oliver Robbins, deputy national security adviser at the Cabinet Office, warned the lives of British agents may have been put at risk by Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald and his partner David Miranda. Mr Miranda was stopped by police at Heathrow airport on his way from Germany to the couple’s home in Brazil. It later emerged that his flights had been paid for by The Guardian, and he was transporting nine hard disks and memory sticks, including secret files leaked by Snowden. Some of the information – there were at least 58,000 documents in his possession – was so sensitive that British agents had to be moved for their own safety. Mr Robbins said the material was likely to contain details of secret techniques used to prevent terror attacks, personal data about agents at home and abroad and ‘other intelligence activities vital to UK national security’. At the time, Alan Rusbridger, the editor of The Guardian, branded the claims ‘unsubstantiated and inaccurate’. He said the newspaper had ‘held back a great deal’ of information from Snowden that might be harmful to Britain if it saw the light of day.","Security officials say there was no public interest in Guardian's expose .

"David Cameron is to hold a secret Chequers summit on Thursday with his new Australian election chief to plan a crackdown on immigration and welfare scroungers to revive Tory support. Lynton Crosby, credited with making Boris Johnson London Mayor, is to join a small group that will take charge of Conservative strategy up to the Election, due in 2015. Dubbed the ‘Fab Four’, the group is made up of Mr Cameron, George Osborne, Crosby and No 10 chief-of-staff Ed Llewellyn. Secret summit: David Cameron (right) is to hold a Chequers summit on Thursday with his new Australian election chief to plan a crackdown on immigration and welfare as Lynton Crosby (left) is to join the small group that will take charge of Conservative strategy up to the Election, due in 2015 . The promotion of Crosby, together with his inclusion at this week’s meeting at the Prime Minister’s official country residence, effectively makes him the third most powerful member of the Government. He will tell fellow members of the ‘Fab Four’ that curbing immigration and abuse of state handouts is key to winning the Election. But his elevation has alarmed Tory . enemies of Crosby, 55, dubbed the ‘Wizard of Oz’ for his success in . winning election campaigns in the UK and Australia. They claim  his . reputation for focusing on immigration and welfare could wreck attempts . to shed the Tories’ ‘Nasty Party’ image. Dubbed 'fab four': The group is made up of Cameron, Crosby, George Osborne (right) and No 10 chief-of-staff Ed Llewellyn (left) When The Mail on Sunday revealed his appointment in November, officials said Crosby would work from the London office of his polling firm CTF, not Conservative HQ. But a well-placed source said: ‘It is all a pretence. Lynton is in and out of Cameron’s office all the time and never off the phone to Osborne. The entire party is now in the hands of four men – Cameron, Osborne, Crosby and Llewellyn.’ Other Tory Cabinet Ministers have been kept in the dark about the ‘Fab  Four’ gathering  at Chequers. Crosby, who is being paid £200,000 a year for four or five days work per month, is renowned for his blunt macho style. He raised the hackles of  Mr Cameron’s senior female advisers by telling them  ‘there is no such thing as the women’s vote’. ‘We have spent nearly ten years trying . to attract modern women to the party, now Crosby tells us there is no . such thing as the women’s vote,’ said one. ‘It is an insult.’ Outspoken: Mr Crosby's elevation has alarmed Tory enemies of his. They claim his reputation for focusing on immigration and welfare could wreck attempts to shed the Tories' 'Nasty Party' image . Crosby has already clashed with Tory billionaire Lord Ashcroft, former Tory chairman, who warned  Mr Cameron not to appoint him. Ashcroft criticised Crosby after The Mail on Sunday reported that Crosby advised Mr Johnson to focus on traditional Tory voters and not waste time chasing after ‘f****** Muslims’. Crosby did not deny making  such a remark but insisted he was not ‘racist’. His return has also reduced the prospects of a Downing Street comeback for Steve Hilton, the shaven-headed Tory guru who devised the ‘Big Society’ crusade. ‘Lynton thinks that is all  airy-fairy nonsense and has no  time for Steve,’ said one insider.","The group includes David Cameron, George Osborne, Lynton Crosby and No 10 chief-of-staff Ed Llewellyn .

"Families will be forced to pay tax on jewellery and other heirlooms under controversial new plans drawn up by the Liberal Democrats. Under the scheme, tax inspectors would get unprecedented new powers to go into homes and value rings, necklaces, paintings, furniture and other family treasures. Householders would be forced to pay a new ‘wealth’ levy on the assets – with the threat of fines for those who refused to let snoops value their possessions. A policy document seen by The Mail on Sunday spells out how the taxman ‘may have to visit homes to test values of jewellery, paintings, etc’. Controversial: Lib Dem plans to tax all assets including jewellery formed part of a policy document commissioned by the party's Federal Policy Committee, which includes Nick Clegg - pictured at home with wife Miriam . Last night, Liberal Democrat MP Tessa Munt said that the jewellery tax was ‘an interesting idea’. Another plan to extend the proposed mansion tax to include those with ‘buy to let’ and holiday homes is also being considered by Nick Clegg’s party. Both the Lib Dems and Labour are already committed to introducing a mansion tax on individual properties worth over £2 million. However, the document reveals the Deputy Prime Minister’s party is now looking to go much further and levy the tax if anyone’s total property holdings are worth more than £2 million. That would mean those who had invested in buy-to-let flats or a holiday home could be caught by the tax, even if none of those properties was worth over £2 million on their own. Last night, both the jewellery and mansion tax moves were condemned by the Lib Dems’ Conservative Coalition partners as ‘the politics of envy at their worst’. The plans come in a policy document drawn up by party tax experts – including Ms Munt and key Clegg ally David Laws – as groundwork for the Lib Dems’ next General Election manifesto. Commissioned by the party’s Federal Policy Committee, which includes Mr Clegg and other senior Lib Dems, the report makes clear the party’s determination to force the better-off to pay more tax. It lists, among a catalogue of proposals, a new ‘net wealth tax’ on personal assets, which would require taxpayers ‘to self-assess their net worth’ – which could then be checked by inspectors. Plot: Under the scheme, tax inspectors would get unprecedented powers to go into homes and value rings, necklaces, paintings, furniture and other family treasures . The . report says: ‘HM Revenue and Customs, in policing the system, may have . to visit homes to test whether asset values of jewellery, paintings etc, . were correct.’ HMRC last . night confirmed that they currently had no routine powers to enter . people’s homes, with tax inspectors needing a court order for that level . of access. The document, to . be discussed at next month’s Lib Dem conference, gives no details on . what the rates would be for the wealth tax. A . similar scheme is already in place in France, with the levy paid on all . ‘global assets’ including cars, jewellery and investments – with French . tax inspectors having the right to enter homes. After his election last . year, new Socialist president Francois Hollande more than doubled the . main wealth tax rate from 0.25 per cent to 0.55 per cent for anyone with . a ‘global fortune’ of between £690,000 and £1.1 million. The Lib Dem blueprint also set out plans to expand the scope of the proposed mansion tax to cover an entire property portfolio, as an alternative to the ‘jewellery’ tax. The document said: ‘If successfully designed, this would ensure taxpayers with multiple properties would be liable for the mansion tax on the cumulative value of their holding above £2 million.’ One senior party member last night said the so-called ‘mansion tax-plus’ would be hugely popular among party activists in their South-West of England heartland, where people resent well-off outsiders buying up second homes and putting up property prices for local residents. But tax experts forecast that the change would end up bringing many more people into the mansion tax net. Mike Warburton, tax director at accountants Grant Thornton, said: ‘A hell of a lot more people would be caught by a cumulative mansion tax.’ He also condemned the proposal to extend the mansion tax as a ‘double taxation’ on owners of buy-to-let properties, who already pay tax on the rent they receive. Revealed: How the Mail on Sunday broke plans to target the wealthy last year. Tories have warned that a Frenchstyle 'jewellery' tax would end up driving wealth out of the country . In . a further move, the Lib Dems are also looking to boost the income from . inheritance tax by changing the current gift exemption rules. Currently, . any items given away in the seven years before death are subject to . inheritance tax but the party wants to extend that to 15 years. Separately, . Labour confirmed that it would force a vote in the Commons to bring in a . mansion tax and appealed to Lib Dem MPs to join them in forcing the . measure through against Conservative  opposition. Last night, the Lib Dem tax agenda met with a scathing response from the Tories who warned that a Frenchstyle ‘jewellery’ tax would end up driving wealth out of the country. And the revised mansion tax scheme was condemned as a ‘direct attack’ on people investing for their retirement. Tory MP Charlie Elphicke said: ‘This is the politics of envy at its worst. Not content with taxing people’s homes, the Liberal Democrats want to send tax inspectors to root through possessions – from your car to your jewellery. This is invasive, it’s punitive and it’s anti-aspiration– and people won’t stand for it.’ A Lib Dem spokesman last night said the tax ideas would be discussed by the party, but insisted they were not yet approved policy. He said: ‘This consultation is part of the process of asking for ideas on how to ensure a fairer tax system. ‘It is up to Lib Dem party members as to whether these eventually become party policy.’ Privately, one party insider said the Lib Dems would be ‘mad’ to go with the French-style wealth tax. Last night, an opinion poll showed Labour maintained a five point lead over the Tories during the past month. The ComRes survey put Labour on 36 per cent, Tories 31, UKIP 14 and Lib Dems down three points on just eight.","Families will be forced to pay tax on heirlooms under Lib Dem scheme .

"A Russian news website published a photograph today that it claims is the first to show US intelligence leaker Edward Snowden since he emerged from a Moscow airport in August. In the blurry image published by Life News, a casually dressed man sporting a goatee with sunglasses perched on his head is pictured pushing a supermarket trolley full of groceries across a road. A car with partly legible Russian plates and a crossing sign identify the scene as in Russia. Doing the chores: A Russian website has published a picture which it claims shows CIA leaker Edward Snowden pushing a shopping trolley in Moscow in the first public image since he was granted asylum . 'The photograph was taken in Moscow,' said Life News, which is known for its close ties to the Kremlin and security services. There has been no reported sighting of Snowden since he walked out of Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport on August 1 after obtaining temporary asylum in Russia despite protests from Washington. The 30-year-old former CIA contractor is wanted by the United States after revealing details of massive surveillance by the National Security Agency to the media. Snowden's Russian lawyer Anatoly Kucherena has said he is living in a secret location in fear of being tracked down by US law enforcers. Life News published video extracts from an interview with Kremlin-friendly Kucherena, who refused to confirm that Snowden is living in Moscow. 'Let's take as a starting point that on the photograph that came into your possession you can't see the region or anything, only numbers (on a car number plate),' he said. AFP correspondant Maria Antonova tweeted this screen grab from Russian TV station Rossiya 24 showing what they report is the back of Edward Snowden's head as he leaves the Moscow airport . Wanted man: Snowden with Sarah Harrison of WikiLeaks (left) and an unidentified woman during a press conference he gave in Sheremetyevo airport as he sought asylum in Russia . The photograph, if genuine, also does not show the bodyguards who Kucherena says accompany Snowden. It was not clear when the photograph was taken, however it is likely to be several weeks old as it is now autumn in Russia and the picture shows trees covered with green leaves. Life News, which is the online wing of popular tabloid Tvoi Den, wrote on a Russian social networking page that it paid 100,000 rubles (about $3,000) for the photograph submitted via its website. Kucherena last month told Itogi weekly magazine that Snowden manages to walk around in disguise. 'He would walk past you and you wouldn't recognise him,' he told Itogi. 'It's a question of clothes and small alterations to his appearance... He really does walk freely around on the streets.' Official: Snowden's new refugee documents granted by Russia as seen during a news conference on August 1 . Life News pointed out that the man resembling Snowden did not seem to be economising on his supermarket shop, with a trolley containing at least half a dozen bags - despite claims by Kucherena that the American is running out of money. 'As you can see the former special services employee has picked up a full trolley of food according to American tradition. That clearly cost more than one thousand rubles,' it wrote. Kucherena told the website that '(Snowden) is living in quite a poor way as he has practically no money'. The photograph appears to show Snowden breaking Russian law by jaywalking, Life News added, an offence for which he could be fined. Life News, known for eye-catching scoops, in August published photographs showing Snowden walking out of Sheremetyevo airport with a huge grin on his face. None of the journalists keeping watch at the airport spotted him at the time and it was not clear how the website obtained the photographs.","Image shows man with a goatee pushing shopping trolley across road .

"A jury in Washington state convicted this afternoon a 21-year-old man of murdering a 16-year-old developmentally disabled girl in 2010. Tyler Savage was found guilty of first-degree murder in the death of Kimberly Daily, a Special Olympian who had the mental capacity of an 11-year-old. Savage's  defense team has claimed that Daily's death was the result of a tragic accident during consensual sex. But Pierce County prosecutors were able to convince the jury that the defendant strangled the teen to death in August 2010 to cover up her rape. When he is sentenced January 17, the 21-year-old convicted killer will face life in prison without parole. The members of the jury panel delivered the guilty verdict after less than 24 hours of deliberation, The News Tribune reported. Upon learning his fate, a clean-cut Tyler Savage remained impassive. During the trial, the defendant testified that on August 17, 2010, Daily met with him near her home and had intercourse with him willingly, and that her death resulted from a sex game gone awry involving strangulation suggested by the girl. Pierce County Prosecutor Mark Lindquist insisted in his closing arguments Monday that Savage premeditated the girl's death. ‘This was a rape. This was a murder. That's what we pointed out to the jury. That's what the jury found,’ Lindquist said after the verdict was delivered. Kimberly's father, Cecil Daily, embraced relatives and friends who were in the courtroom Tuesday upon hearing the guilty verdict. Resting place: Daily was found dead in blackberry bushes near her home with her shirt and bra tied around her neck . Confession: Savage, then 18 years old, told detectives that her led Daily to an isolated area and choked her when she attempted to leave because he thought it was 'lame' Daily died August 17, 2010. Savage, then 18 years old, was the last person to see her alive, but he initially denied knowing what happened to her. Tyler eventually led police to her body dumped in blackberry bushes 12 blocks away from the girl’s home and confessed to killing her. In a taped interview, Savage told detectives he and Daily had arranged to meet on Facebook, but as they were sitting and talking, the girl decided to leave. Thinking it was ‘lame,’ the 18-year-old told police that he choked Daily, and then tied a bra and T-shirt around her neck, KIRO-TV reported. ‘She died and I threw her in the sticker bushes kind of afraid of what I did,’ Savage said in the interview. Afterwards, the teen went to a neighbor’s house to play Dungeons & Dragons online in order to ‘forget’ what happened, according to court documents cited by KOMO News at the time. Not so innocent: The defense claimed that Daily had sex with Savage willingly and asked him to choke her . Closure: Kimberly's father, Cecil Daily (center) was in the courtroom when the verdict was delivered . However, Savage changed his story at the start of his trial, claiming that the death was an accident in an unsuccessful bid to get the charge against him downgraded from first-degree murder to second-degree manslaughter. Earlier this year, Washington Governor Jay Inslee signed Kimmie's Law, named after the late Miss Daily, which requires police to enter vulnerable people suffering from developmental disabilities into a state database within six hours of being missing.","Tyler Savage will spend the rest of his life in prison for the death of Kimberly Daily in August 2010 .

"The City of London has postponed its plan to issue the St Paul's anti-capitalist protesters with legal notices requiring them to leave their tent city. The City of London Corporation confirmed it had suspended legal action against demonstrators until the morning, when the situation will be reviewed. A spokesman said: 'We have not handed them (the protesters) a letter this afternoon.' Earlier a spokesman for St Paul's said the cathedral was not taking joint action with the City of London Corporation. Men (and women) at work: Protesters on the steps of St Paul's unfurled a banner on the steps of St Paul's Cathedral painting their action as essential improvements . Reprieve: Protesters were due to be served with legal notices today by the City of London Corporation, but it is now scheduled to happen in the morning . 'Members of Chapter met yesterday following the resignation of the Dean and are due to meet with the Bishop of London today,' the spokesman said. 'The Chapter have not yet sought an injunction, nor are they serving notices on the protesters today. 'They are committed to a peaceful resolution at all costs.' There were fears today that a split among senior Church of England figures on how to deal with the protest could lead to the camp remaining on the steps of St Paul's during next year's Olympic Games and the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations. Concerns that legal action could lead to violent evictions has led to the Church's liberal wing - led by Archbishop Rowan Williams - to oppose moves to support the City of London Corporation's plans. The split could mean that some protesters would be moved from the City's land but could be allowed to remain in the shadow of St Paul's indefinitely. Authorities were given a possible foretaste of any eviction they may be forced to carry out in the early hours of this morning when police arrested 12 protesters outside Parliament Square. They were among a group of up to 200 demonstrators who are opposed plans to criminalise the act of squatting homes and other building. A protester lies before three policemen in Parliament Square during the demonstration against plans to criminalise squatting . Last night the Archbishop of Canterbury broke his silence on the protesters camped outside St Paul's Cathedral, saying he sympathised with the 'urgent larger issues' they raised. In a sign of the panic within the Church of England high command since the arrival of the activists, Dr Rowan Williams intervened yesterday after the dean of the cathedral became the third member of staff to resign. Indicating his support for the anti-capitalists' aims, the Archbishop said: 'The urgent larger issues raised by the protesters at St Paul's remain very much on the table. Archbishop: Dr Rowan Williams has kept his counsel since the protest began but, after the resignation of Dean of St Paul's Cathedral, Graeme Knowles, he has spoken and backed the demonstrators . 'We need – as a Church and as society as a whole – to work to make sure that they are properly addressed.' The Archbishop's intervention was sparked by the resignation yesterday of the Dean of St Paul's, the Right Reverend Graeme Knowles. The dean caused controversy when he closed the historic building's doors last month for the first time since the Second World War, citing 'health and safety concerns' over the tents. The cathedral reopened last week but the dean said yesterday his position had become 'untenable' amid the ongoing row. The Archbishop's endorsement of the right of the protesters to campaign showed just how confused the Church of England remains in its response to the encampment on its doorstep. His remarks came as the Bishop of London, Richard Chartres, confirmed yesterday that legal efforts to persuade the activists to leave have begun. Stepping down: The Dean of St Paul's, the Rt Rev Graeme Knowles, pictured yesterday speaking to demonstrators camped outside the Cathedral, has resigned . 'Untenable': Rt Rev Knowles became the second of the cathedral's senior clergy to resign in less than a week . Trouble brewing: The Bishop of London (centre) and a protestor in the tea tent yesterday . The bishop stressed that cathedral officials did not want a violent eviction. The . dean's departure followed Canon Chancellor of St Paul's, Giles Fraser – . who had told police to leave the activists alone after their arrival on . October 15 – and part-time chaplain Fraser Dyer. The Occupy London protesters were showing no signs of leaving despite the cathedral's requests. Dr Williams said the dean's departure was 'very sad news'. He . added: 'The events of the last couple of weeks have shown very clearly . how decisions made in good faith by good people under unusual pressure . can have utterly unforeseen and unwelcome consequences, and the clergy . of St Paul's deserve our understanding. Graeme Knowles will be much . missed.' 'Move beyond slogans': The Bishop of London has criticised demonstrators' methods . An unlikely crowd: A demonstrator directs questions to Rt Rev Knowles (second from right), and the Bishop of London, Richard Chartres (right) at the weekend . Crowd: The bishop and dean addressed a crowd of hundreds by the steps of St Paul's . Yesterday a . significant protester splinter group refused even to support the . cathedral's requests for drink, drugs and loud music to be banned from . the protest camp. They . appeared largely bemused by the resignation of the dean – which he had . to yesterday submit to the Queen, since his job is a crown appointment. Their . reluctance to leave was indicated by placards saying 'Hell no we won't . go' and 'Jesus did not quit – he drove the money lenders from the . temple'. The Government is considering whether the law needs to be tightened to deal with protests such as that being held outside St Paul's Cathedral. Justice minister Nick Herbert said everyone had a right to 'make their views known'. But he insisted it was not right to 'disrupt the life of the community' by setting up encampments. 'Everybody agrees there should be a right of peaceful protest in our country,' Mr Herbert told the BBC's Politics Show. 'People have an entitlement to make their view known. It's fundamental to our democracy and the coalition is committed to protect that. 'But we saw - for instance in Parliament Square, where there was a permanent encampment which had gone on for years there and was very disruptive to the enjoyment of Parliament Square by others. 'You cannot protest peacefully at Parliament Square because it is closed off to others. We are taking action to deal with that. 'And if necessary we will take action to deal with other invasions of private property that involved permanent encampments.' He went on: 'We want to protect peaceful protest. We do not think that it's right to disrupt the life of the community, and trespass, and permanently to set up and live somewhere - just as travellers do - which invades private property.' In a statement Mr . Knowles, the dean for four years, said: 'Since the arrival of the . protesters' camp outside the cathedral, we have all been put under a . great deal of strain and have faced what would appear to be some . insurmountable issues. 'It . has become increasingly clear to me that, as criticism of the cathedral . has mounted in the press, media and in public opinion, my position as . dean of St Paul's was becoming untenable. 'In . order to give the opportunity for a fresh approach to the complex and . vital questions facing St Paul's, I have thought it best to stand down . as dean, to allow new leadership to be exercised.' St . Paul's spokesman the Right Reverend Michael Colclough said: 'We are . committed to doing all we can to find a way ahead that ensures the main . message of the protest is not only heard but properly attended to, and . in such a way that people in the local community, as well as our own . team, can do their work peacefully for the good of everyone.' The . Bishop of London explained that due to the 'great mystery' of the . Church of England's organisation, the cathedral made its own decisions . without control from him. But he said St Paul's officials had asked him . to help out in the protesters' row. He . went on: 'There are many diverse voices in the camp outside St Paul's, . but among them, serious issues are being articulated which the cathedral . has always sought to address.' The . bishop stressed that all in the church wanted a peaceful resolution, . but added said that any responsible organisation had to investigate its . legal powers. Outside, the . camp still numbers about 200 tents – but barely 50 protesters attended a . meeting yesterday afternoon to decide tactics. About . a quarter of those present indicated that they were reluctant to accept . basic requests from the cathedral for drink and drugs to be barred from . the site and the camp to be kept tidy. In . a statement, the group, whose official name is Occupy London Stock . Exchange, said: 'The management of St Paul's Cathedral is obviously . deeply divided over the position they have taken in response to our . cause – but our cause has never been directed at the staff of the . cathedral.' The real issue was 'challenging the unsustainable financial system that punishes the many and privileges the few', it added.","Split at top of the Church could lead to protesters remaining during London Olympics and Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations .

"Electrical problems found at the National Security Agency's $1.7 billion data center could delay the new facility's long-awaited opening this fall in Utah, the Army Corps of Engineers said yesterday. The data center is filled with super-powered computers designed to store massive amounts of information gathered secretly from phone calls and emails. The Army Corps of Engineers said it discovered the problem during tests ahead of the fall opening of the facility located south of Salt Lake City, on a National Guard base. Construction: Here is an aerial view of the NSA's Utah Data Center in Bluffdale, Utah . Electrical failures are complicating the opening of the National Security Agency's largest data storage center . The Corps, which is in charge of construction, says experts are working to correct it. An NSA spokeswoman acknowledges the problem and says the failures are being mitigated. The problems were first reported by the Wall Street Journal. The NSA is currently building a facility that will make it more than seven times the size of the Pentagon, making the secretive compounds the biggest in the country. In addition to building a $1.7 billion data center in Utah, crews also started construction on a computing center that is expected to cost $792million near Baltimore. Together, the two facilities total 228 acres, much of which is dedicated to the collection of emails and phone calls that it was recently revealed the NSA stores without an individual knowledge. Information overload: A report in July showed the NSA is doing a lot more than spying on Americans with terrorist connections, perhaps with the help of its $1.7 billion Utah Data Center . More convenient: As opposed to the remote Salt Lake facility, there is also a 28-acre facility owned by the NSA that in outside of Baltimore, Maryland . Much attention has been paid to the secretive practices of the NSA since consultant Edward Snowden leaked classified documents proving that the intelligence agency had free reign to the electronic footprint of people, both in and out of the country, who used certain phone carriers. NSA official Harvey Davis told Defense One that the Utah facility is 'only brick and mortar' but they need the space because 'it's required to be big' as a result of their growing surveillance. 'I think we're crossing into content,' he told the site. Mike Baker, a former cover field operations officer for the CIA, told Fox News that the paranoia surrounding the billion dollar project was understandable yet exaggerated, adding that the main problem was the size of the data collection warehouse. More:The Utah Data Center, near Bluffdale, was rumored to be one of the sites where personal data extracted by the NSA was stored . Storage: An aerial photograph shows the center . 'The fact that they’re building a new data center isn’t news,' Baker told Fox News. 'They’ve got several other [similar] facilities. The size of this is what is creating the stir.' Once built, the million square foot centre will be more than five times the size of the US Capitol, and will use an estimated $40m of electricity every year, according to one estimate. NSA public information officer Vanee' Vines added: 'Many allegations have been made about the planned activities of the Utah Data Center . 'What it will be is a state-of-the-art facility designed to support the Intelligence Community’s efforts to further strengthen and protect the nation. NSA is the executive agent for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and will be the lead agency at the center.' Mystery: A close-up section of NSA's Utah Data Center is shown in Bluffdale in July . Powerhouse: These images were released last year as it emerged the government is secretly collecting the telephone records of millions of Verizon customers, as well as data from companies including Facebook and Google . The Utah Data Center which is being constructed on Camp Williams on the Salt Lake-Utah County line was scheduled to be completed in October - but officials have been tight-lipped about what will be stored there. The spy center is being built at an estimated cost of $1.7 billion, and is expected to employ 100 to 200 permanent employees after its completion. The plans note they must all be U.S. citizens. In light of the nature of the site they are building, many will have to have a higher degree of security clearance than an average construction worker. Despite the boom for the local economy, the American Civil Liberties Union of Utah has expressed their fears over what will be stored at the center. Stash: The government has been tight-lipped about what will be stored in the center's four 'data halls' Plans: Sketches released by Army engineers show the massive center, which is believed to cost $1.7 billion . 'We're mining data, we're gathering data and it's all done secretly,' ACLU of Utah director Karen McCreary told Fox13. 'We don't even know what's going on.' 'When the NSA facility in Utah was announced, local officials praised it for the jobs it would bring,' Libertas director Connor Boyack added. 'As Americans are now learning, those jobs entail harvesting the data generated by innocent Americans not suspected of any crime, in contradiction to the Fourth Amendment.'","Government was scheduled to complete its data storing facility in Utah in October .

"Workers who diligently save into a pension are under attack from ‘corrosive’ plans sneaked out by the Liberal Democrats, experts warned. Nick Clegg’s party is calling for the total amount that can be saved into a pension pot without incurring punitive taxes to be slashed by a third from £1.5million to £1million. Experts warned yesterday the latest tax grab will hurt many middle-class workers. Tax grab: Nick Clegg's party sneaked out plans to raid the pension pots of diligent savers . A 65-year-old man with a £1million pension pot can buy an annual income for life of around £27,500 a year. This calculation assumes the annuity is inflation-proofed, and his spouse will continue to get half of the amount if he dies first. Insult: Experts said changes would be an attack on financial security of the elderly . The major policy review, commissioned by the Lib Dem leadership, is also calling for the annual amount that can be saved into a pension to be cut from £50,000 to £30,000. The Chancellor has already revealed the allowances will be reduced to £1.25million over a lifetime and £40,000 a year in April 2014 – but the Lib Dems want to go even further. Tom McPhail, head of pensions research at the financial advisers Hargreaves Lansdown, said constant tinkering with pension policy is ‘corrosive’. ‘It reinforces the sense that you can’t trust the Government with your pension because one day they will come along and change the rules,’ he said. ‘The Lib Dem proposals seem to have lost touch with reality. Liberal Democrat ministers will be expected to vote against their cherished mansion tax policy in any Commons vote on the issue, Downing Street said yesterday. Labour is attempting to split the Coalition by forcing a vote on the principle of imposing a swingeing tax on homes worth more than £2million. Business Secretary Vince Cable indicated on Sunday that Lib Dem ministers might vote for the motion – potentially inflicting an embarrassing defeat on the Government. But Downing Street yesterday indicated that all ministers would be expected to support Government policy, which is against the tax. A source said: ‘Lib Dem support for a mansion tax is well known, but this is just a political stunt by Labour and they know it.’ ‘Telling savers that the maximum pension they can aspire to in their mid-sixties is £27,500 a year before they start suffering a hefty tax charge is an insult to anyone who aspires to build financial security for themselves and their spouse. ‘The constant cutting of pension allowances leads to the not unreasonable conclusion that politicians can’t be trusted.’ In recent years, the amount that can be saved into a pension has been under attack from a government that has repeatedly cut the key thresholds. For example, it was possible to save a total of £255,000 a year with a lifetime allowance of £1.8million in 2010. Malcolm McLean, a consultant at the pension firm Barnett Waddingham, said ‘this is not just about rich people’, adding: ‘All the changes are confusing and unsettling when people need a period of stability.’ Mr McLean said victims would include widows or widowers who want to put a large amount into their pension immediately after the death of their spouse. Workers who have been made redundant and want to put their payoff into a pension pot would also be hit. The ideas are laid out in a paper to be discussed at the Lib Dems’ spring conference in Brighton next month, but it is not yet party policy. Joanne Segars, of the National Association of Pension Funds, said: ‘We need stability so people can trust pensions and get on with saving for their old age.’","Lib Dem leadership is also calling for the annual amount that can be saved into a pension to be cut from £50,000 to £30,000 .

"First came the internet spoofs, followed by a Christmas card featuring Ellen Degeneres and Portia de Rossi. Now supermarket ASDA have become the latest to produce a version of Kim Kardashian's infamous 'Break the Internet' shoot - and are using it to sell £10 champagne. The supermarket has recreated photographer Jean Goude’s image using a Kim lookalike who poses with a champagne coupe resting on her bottom, a spray of drink arching over her head and into the glass. Scroll down for video . Which one is which? Asda have copied John Goude's now famous photograph of Kim Kardashian in a bid to promote their Christmas Champagne offer . The advert reads, ‘DON’T BREAK THE BUDGET, PIERRE DARCYS’ - a reference to the store's budget champagne. ASDA's new Kim spoof is the latest in a series, all of which have flooded the internet since Kim's Paper magazine cover was revealed last week. Kim has been transformed into a centaur, a Simpsons character and has even had googly eyes superimposed onto her bottom. Other memes have compared Kim’s shapely derriere to anything from a glazed crispy crème donut, to a pair of peaches and perhaps, least flatteringly, a potato. But the photographs - one of which shows Kim standing front on completely naked -  have not received an entirely positive reaction. Indeed, such was the furore that Paper magazine editor, Micky Boardman, was forced to come to Kim's defense over the weekend. He denied claims that her bottom in particular had been digitally enhanced and insisted that every part of it was the real deal. 'The body is Kim’s body,’ he said. ‘Yes the image is retouched as all photos on the covers of magazines are retouched. 'If you know Jean-Paul’s work, you know he creates magic like the splash of the champagne over the head with pasting images together. As for the butt we didn’t pad it or make it bigger. It’s all her.’ Amusing: Kim was turned into a Simpsons character by Alexsandro Palombo . Kim happily posed for photographer Jean-Paul Gaude, however, the photographs have become the subject of many memes, spoofs and parodies . Kim has also spoken out about the images, saying 'I'm never one to preach, but I felt really positive and really good about myself. 'I like the photos, I did it for me, I hope other people like them.' She also revealed that the champagne glass pose wasn't as easy as it looked. 'My back hurt for about a week after that shoot...[photographer Jean-Paule Goude] has an art of posing you and it was definitely not comfortable.'","ASDA has recreated Jean Goude's photograph using a model .

"A newly discovered member of the Megaloptera family has been found that could be the largest aquatic insect in the world. It was found on a mountain in Chengdu, Sichuan province in China. The mysterious specimen of which little is known has a wingspan of 8.3 inches (21 centimetres). No thanks: This photo from the Insect Museum of West China shows the largest aquatic insect ever found, discovered recently in a mountain of Chengdu. When they are larvae they spend a lot of time out of sight in the water, only leaving when they pupate and they become adults. They can be found in or near lakes and ponds . The family of Megaloptera includes about 300 species of fishflies, dobsonflies and alderflies. The name Megaloptera describes that insects have large (megal) wings (ptera) compared to their bodies . This insect, of the order Megaloptera, has a wingspan of a whopping 8.3 inches (21 centimeters), making it the largest aquatic insect in the world . And this latest find is no exception, dwarfing other such insects of the order. According to Scientific American members of the Megaloptera family are not well known. When they are larvae they spend a lot of time out of sight in the water, only leaving when they pupate and they become adults. They can be found in or near a variety of wet environments including ponds, lakes and swamps. The huge mandibles at the front of the insect, meanwhile, are not used for eating but rather to attract females and hold them in place during mating. The species is also known for its ferocious bite, which can break human skin. Megaloptera insects typically live for only a few days as adults, so many will spend there few days of adulthood mating, producing new larvae to grow underwater. With a wingspan 8.3 inches (21 centimetres), this species breaks the previous record holder for largest aquatic insect, the South American helicopter damselfly, which has a wingspan of 7.5 inches (19 centimetres). The insect was found on a mountain near Chengdu, Sichuan province in China (shown) The huge mandibles at the front of the insect, shown, are not used for eating but rather to attract females and hold them in place during mating. The females of the species are also known for their ferocious bite, which can break human skin. Megaloptera insects typically live for only a few days as adults . A scientist discovered a new species of wasp less than a millimetre long living in a tree in his son’s school playground. Dr Andrew Polaszek, an insect expert at London’s Natural History Museum, found the wasp inside whiteflies on a maple tree. He said: ‘I noticed some of the whiteflies looked slightly different to the others so I took them to the laboratory. When I saw the wasp inside I knew it looked different to anything I’d seen before.’ Dr Polaszek, 54, made the discovery five years ago at Sevenoaks Primary School in Kent, where his son Timothy was a pupil. But rigorous tests to establish the wasp as a new species – named Encarsia harrisoni – have only just been completed. The wasp, which Dr Polaszek named after fellow Sevenoaks scientist Dr David Harrison, is a parasitoid, meaning it lays its eggs inside other insects.","The largest aquatic insect in the world has been found in Chengdu, China .

"Provacative idea: Vince Cable says that Lib Dem ministers may join forces with Labour in a Commons vote calling for a mansion tax . Liberal Democrat ministers may join forces with Labour in a Commons vote calling for a £2million mansion tax, Vince Cable revealed yesterday. The Business Secretary’s provocative suggestion – which could split the Coalition – came as it emerged that the Lib Dems are considering widening the scope of their mansion tax proposals to include second homes and buy-to-let properties. This would mean that voters would be taxed on property portfolios worth above £2million and could dramatically widen the number of households liable to the annual 1 per cent levy. The policy is seen as being helpful for the Lib Dems in the South West of England where the party is traditionally strong and which has a high number of second homes. According to the 2011 Census, 1.57million people living in England and Wales have a second address in another local authority area. Mr Cable, seen as a likely broker of a future Lib-Lab pact, suggested his party’s MPs would be happy to ditch their loyalty to the Coalition to vote for their cherished policy. A form of mansion tax was adopted last week by Ed Miliband as a way of funding Labour’s sudden commitment to reintroducing the 10p tax band for the lower paid. But Mr Cable said it was ‘a policy whose time has come’ and welcomed indications that the Labour leader had ‘seen sense’ on the issue. Mr Miliband has said he will stage a Commons vote on the tax in the coming weeks in an attempt to split the Coalition and increase pressure for it to be brought in. If Lib Dem MPs vote with Labour the Government could suffer a rare, and highly embarrassing, Commons defeat. It would not automatically result in the introduction of the new tax, but would damage already tense relations between the Coalition partners. Policy: A form of mansion tax was adopted last week by Ed Miliband as a way of funding Labour¿s sudden commitment to reintroducing the 10p tax band for the lower paid . Mr Cable said his party’s support would depend on Mr Miliband being ‘sensible’ about the idea and not playing ‘political games’ by dragging in wider issues, such as Labour’s new plan to partly reintroduce the 10p tax rate using the proceeds of the mansion tax. Asked if the Lib Dems would support Labour in a Commons vote, Mr Cable told Sky News: ‘It depends entirely how they phrase it. If it is purely a statement of support for the principle of a mansion tax I’m sure my colleagues would want to support it.’ Lib Dem proposals for a mansion tax would place an annual 1 per cent levy on homes worth more than £2million. Owners would pay the tax on the value of their home above £2million. Now, a policy paper prepared for the party leadership suggests it could be extended to cover total property holdings, potentially dragging in many families with second homes. Last week, Labour said 70,000 families could be hit by a levy on properties worth £2million or more. But if it was extended to cover those with buy-to-let investments and second homes it could hit many more voters. Mr Cable played down suggestions that the tax would be extended, saying the priority was to get it introduced. David Cameron has vetoed repeated Lib Dem calls to impose a mansion tax, warning that it would be unfair on people who happen to live in wealthy areas.","Vince Cable suggested Lib Dems would be happy to ditch loyalty to coalition .

"The humble fish finger celebrates its 60th anniversary next year and once accounted for 10 per cent of all the fish eaten in Britain. But new statistics show that Britain could be falling out of love with the traditional teatime snack, with sales falling by more than two per cent this year. While the breadcrumbed treat is struggling, fresh fish is doing better, with sales increasing, even while fresh meat sales, fresh poultry and game sales fell. Britain is losing its taste for fish fingers after nearly 60 years as one of the nation's best loved teatime treats . Figures show that sales of all fish fingers, including own label and big name brands, fell by 2.2% . Price rises, shoppers choosing healthier, fresh alternatives and simply getting tired of the frozen favourite are all being blamed for the decline of the fish finger. Big brands like Birds Eye, the original inventor of the snack, saw sales fall by up to seven per cent according to trade journal The Grocer. Figures show sales of all fish fingers, including own label and big name brands, fell by 2.2 per cent to 28.7 million kilos in the 12 months to the end of August. The breaded fishy favourite is losing ground to fresh fish from the chiller cabinet - which saw sales rise to 0.3 per cent in volume, during the same period that fresh meat sales were down two per cent, and fresh poultry and game fell 2.3 per cent. And sales of  'ambient' fish like tuna, salmon and crabmeat which can go in the cupboard and last much longer have risen 4.6 per cent in value and 2.1 per cent to 88 million kg a year in volume, the report said. Dinenrtime staple: Analysts say that diners are falling out of love with the treat as a snack in a sandwich . According to analysts, diners are falling out of love with the treat whether it is as a snack in a sandwich or served in the traditional way with chips and peas. Part of this may be to do with habits - families are less likely to all sit round the table and eat together - or health reasons with alternative foods chosen for protein for instance. But experts say a lack of innovation and marketing has also contributed to the decline of the dinnertime staple. No longer popular: Big brands like Birds Eye, the original inventor of the fish finger, saw sales fall by up to seven per cent. Fish fingers were first produced by Birds Eye in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, in 1955 . It added: 'It's enough to drive poor of Captain Birdseye to drink. Sales of frozen fish have continued on their downward trajectory this year.' Birds Eye senior brand manager Andrew Foster told The Grocer shoppers were seeking 'delicious guilt-free meal options' rather than products coated in batter or breadcrumbs. Yvonne Adam of rivals Young's Seafood said: 'Consumers are looking for the best fish, made delicious, which is easy to cook, with health benefits and value for money promotions.' The first fish fingers were produced by Birds Eye at their factory in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, in 1955 and launched to British consumers on September 26 in the same year. They had originally been patented by the company's founder Clarence Birdseye in 1927 but it took years to create a commercial version. Even though they were designed to be frozen, when they first when on sale, only one in five homes had a freezer so they had to be eaten almost immediately as if fresh.","Fish fingers used to account for 10% of all fish eaten in Britain .

"England goalkeeper Joe Hart is expected to be recalled by Manchester City on Sunday for the opening game of their Premier League title defence, but is still waiting for a new contract offer from the champions with less than two years left on his current deal. City boss Manuel Pellegrini has moved quickly to reassure 27-year-old Hart about his position even though he was left out of last weekend’s Community Shield clash with Arsenal. After City’s 3-0 defeat at Wembley with Willy Caballero in goal, Pellegrini is leaning towards starting with the tried and tested Hart for their first league match at Newcastle United. Number one: Joe Hart is expected to start in goal for Manchester City against Newcastle on Sunday . Tough battle: Hart will have to fight off competition from new Man City team-mate Willy Caballero . Hart has been City’s regular goalkeeper in both their Premier League titles in the last three seasons but his longer-term future is less certain. Although City mentioned the possibility of a new contract offer at the end of last season, nothing has been discussed since, with the club prioritising the signatures of Vincent Kompany, Sergio Aguero and David Silva on long-term teals. Striker Edin Dzeko is expected to follow suit shortly. Hart’s current contract runs until 2016 and City will have to consider their options before the end of the year as the player’s transfer value will start to decrease the nearer it gets to the end of the term. He would probably cost around £30million in the current transfer market. Decision maker: Manuel Pellegrini will decide who will start in goal for Manchester City in their league opener . Hart, who signed for City from Shrewsbury before they were under Abu Dhabi ownership, is happy on and off the pitch in Manchester but will be glad to given the nod by Pellegrini to start the league season. He joined City’s pre-season tour of the United States late after playing for England at the World Cup but put in an impressive 45-minute performance against Liverpool in Yankee Stadium. Hart is regarded as one of the most commanding goalkeepers in Europe but Pellegrini decided to sign £6million Caballero from his former club Malaga because he is a fan of the Argentine’s kicking ability. Caballero is renowned as a good “keeper sweeper” but strayed from his line too often in the defeat against Arsenal. City probable team: Hart - Sagna, Kompany, Nastasic, Kolarov - Silva, Fernando, Toure, Nasri - Dzeko, Jovetic .","The England goalkeeper is expected to start for City against Newcastle .

"Construction has begun on a luxury five-star hotel being built INSIDE a 100-metre deep, water-filled abandoned quarry in China at the base of the Tianmenshan Mountain. The £345million cave hotel in the Songjiang District has been designed by British-based firm Atkins and will have 380 rooms over 19 storeys - two of which will be underwater. The rest of the InterContinental Shimao hotel will be built into the mountainous landscape and guests will be able to do watersports on the lake and use the nearby cliffs for rock-climbing and bungee jumping. It is expected to take around three years to build and guests could be staying in the resort by 2015 - with rooms likely to cost around £200 a night.

"The U.S. Air Force is considered one of the most feared military bodies in the world. But one pilot training unit has adopted an unusually child-like symbol – My Little Pony. Pilots at Oklahoma's Vance Air Force Base have worn a pony inspired patch since April. A class at Vance Air Force base have chosen an unusual patch inspired by My Little Pony . Every class at the flying school chooses a patch, normally using symbols representing courage, such as cougars, scorpions or even skulls. The patch was designed as a joke but has been adopted by the class . But, unusually, Class 14-05 decided to go for something a little more pink, reported The Daily Dot. First Lieutenant Tom Barger told News on 6: ‘During a slideshow presentation, while previewing the different patch options, the student presenter threw the “My Little Pilot” patch design into the mix as an ironic joke. ‘That patch made it all the way through the approval process and is even more ironic since the class never really wanted it in the first place.’ The patch is inspired by My Little Pony cartoon Friendship is Magic. It says in pink stylised writing: ‘My Little Pilot, Flying is magic’. It is thought to be a reference the growing ‘Brony’ community online, a group of grown men who enjoy watching the children’s cartoon. Patches at Vance are unofficial and are worn only during pilot training. He added to Escapist magazine: ‘[The class] thought it was so off-the-wall that it was hilarious. ‘They have embraced the irony and humour of the patch and in so doing have fostered closer ties with each other.’ The usually tough persona of the US Air Force has been changed as the class embraced the comedy patch .","Pilots at Oklahoma's Vance Air Force Base wear a My Little Pony patch .

"A fly-by by a Virgin passenger jet sparked a security scare at Saturday's AFL Grand Final, even prompting Foreign Minister Julie Bishop's bodyguard to 'reach for his gun'. The PR stunt backfired just before the first bounce when the A330 flew low just above the Melbourne Cricket Ground as the showpiece game was about to get underway. Fans tweeted their shock and Collingwood president and TV host Eddie McGuire told how the AFP assigned to Ms Bishop feared the venue was under attack. A low-flying Virgin A330 Airbus shot over the Melbourne Cricket Ground in the pre-game entertainment . Julie Bishop watches the stunt unfold before her eyes at the MCG. Collingwood president Eddie McGuire claimed he saw an Australian Federal Police Officer reach for his gun when the aircraft flew over the MCG. McGuire told Fox Footy, 'I was sitting about 10 metres away from the foreign defence minister Julie Bishop and can I tell you, when the Virgin plane flew over the top of the MCG, I looked around and the secret service bloke from the federal police reached for the gun because no one had told him,' reported the Daily Telegraph. 'This bloke, he went for the gun. I’m serious, mate. I don’t know what he was going to do with it, pop it out of the sky,' he said. The low-altitude A330 Airbus caused an uproar on social media, with many AFL fan's taking to tweeting about the stunt instead of the game. One Twitter user said, 'Hey @AFL and @VirginAustralia - really appreciated the plane flying 20m over my house after weeks of political scaremongering... #AFLGF'. Football fans have taken to Twitter, expressing their outrage over the stunt . Some Twitter uses drew attention to the inappropriate timing of the stunt . Another commented, 'omg @ virgin airlines flying a plane close to the ground for a promotional stunt at the afl grand final during a high terrorism alert'. The stunt come after weeks of heightened tension within Australia, with Prime Minister Tony Abbott announcing an increase in the terror alert to 'high' for the nation. Following 'terror raids' on homes of suspected terrorists, some in the community have questioned the appropriateness of the timing for such a stunt. A Virgin Australia spokesperson said:  'Virgin Australia is the official airline of the AFL and as a show of support for the game we operate a special flight over the MCG on Grand Final day each year.' The flight was apparently operated in strict accordance with Civil Aviation Safety Authority requirements, and flown by three senior pilots with no passengers aboard the plane. Some football fans come out and called for followers to calm down, poking fun at those who were scared by the stunt. 'Those Melbourne football fans are a bunch of cowardly pants-wetters, aren’t they?' Virgin, the official airline partner of the AFL, gave warning of the pre-game entertainment. The airline posted on their Facebook page at midday, 'Are you in Melbourne today? Look up in the sky just after 2pm for our MCG flyover.' One Facebook user backed up the decision, commenting on the post, 'Great display ...don't listen to the drama queens trying to drum up sensationalism in relation to the aircraft flying low over the MCG and causing fear.' Another said, 'Inappropriate? You're kidding. This is Australia, this is how we do things.' Football fanatics at the game and local residents have spoken out against the incident, a pre-organised stunt planned for pre-match entertainment.","Low-altitude A330 airbus frightens fans at AFL grand final .

"Family of an 18-year-old shot from behind and killed by an off-duty St. Louis police officer in October have publicly named the shooter despite authorities withholding the information pending a 'threat assessment.' VonDerrit Myers Jr. was killed by Jason H. Flanery, the teens relatives revealed Wednesday. His name had been inadvertently included with materials delivered to Myers' funeral home. Their lawyer also revealed what he said are Flanery's racially tinged social media posts that indicate a bias against minorities. Scroll down for video . Named: St. Louis cop Jason Flanery was the off-duty officer who fatally shot an 18-year-old in October . Killed: Vonderrit Myers (pictured with his mother) was shot 8 times by the off-duty St Louis police officer as racial tensions in the area were high over events in nearby Ferguson . Attorney Jermaine Wooten noted that Flanery posted his opposition to Obama and belief that the First Lady 'looks drunk, high, and dumb as hell' in a photo--evidence the officer has 'a biased view of African-Americans' said Wooten. There were also criticisms of homosexuals, Flanery said. According to St. Louis Today, Flanery's lawyer, who did not identify Flanery as his client in the case, said: . 'The political views of the officer that was involved in this doesn't change any of the facts that happened.' Included among them, is the fact that Myers was shot eight times, including six times from behind, said a forensic pathologist who performed an independent autopsy. Dr. Cyril Wecht, who has investigated the deaths of John F. Kennedy, Elvis Presley and JonBenet Ramsey, conducted the autopsy at the request of Vonderrit Myers Jr.'s family and outlined the findings during a news conference at the funeral home that will handle Myers' burial. Attorney Jermaine Wooten noted that Flanery posted his opposition to Obama and belief that the First Lady 'looks drunk, high, and dumb as hell' in a photo--evidence the officer has 'a biased view of African-Americans' said Wooten . 'The political views of the officer that was involved in this doesn't change any of the facts that happened.' said the attorney representing the cop in the case, who did not identify Flanery as his client . The family's attorneys said the autopsy suggests Myers was running away from the officer. Myers' parents attended the autopsy announcement but did not comment. 'The evidence shows that the story we've been given by the Police Department does not match up,' one of the attorneys, Jerryl Christmas, said. 'There's no evidence that there was a gun battle going on.' Wecht said it's likely that Myers was initially shot six times in the back of both legs. He said another shot hit the side of the left leg, shattering his femur. The fatal wound was to the side of Myers' face, Wecht said. Police have said Myers shot first at the officer. They released details of lab tests by the Missouri State Highway Patrol that showed gunshot residue on Myers' hand, waistband and shirt. Police union leaders said the finding dispelled claims by Myers' family that he didn't fire at the officer, whose name hasn't been released. The officer's attorney, Brian Millikan, said the results from the independent autopsy support the police account as well. 'It's absolutely consistent with what the officer told the investigators from early on,' said Millikan, a former St. Louis police officer. 'There were no shots fired when (Myers) was running away. That's simply not true.' Police Chief Sam Dotson has said Myers fired three shots before his gun jammed. Millikan said Myers was shot in the back of the legs while lying on his side with a gun in his hand. 'He was propped up on his left elbow, and his legs were facing out at the policeman as he went down, but he was still holding the gun and pointing it at the policeman,' the lawyer said. The incident spurred a round of protests similar to ones in nearby Ferguson after the fatal police shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown. Both Brown and Myers were black. The officers who shot them are white. A grand jury is expected to decide by mid-November whether criminal charges will be filed against Darren Wilson, the Ferguson officer who killed the unarmed Brown. The officer in the Myers shooting is on administrative leave. Police have said Myers shot first at the officer. They released details of lab tests by the Missouri State Highway Patrol that showed gunshot residue on Myers' hand, waistband and shirt. Police union leaders said the finding dispelled claims by Myers' family that he didn't fire at the officer, whose name hasn't been released . He was on patrol as a private security guard, but wearing his police uniform and carrying his department-issued gun when the shooting occurred on Oct. 8. Dotson has said the officer became suspicious when Myers and the men with him started to run. A chase ensued and the officer and Myers got into a physical confrontation. After Myers pulled away, Dotson said, he went up a hill and started shooting at the officer. Police investigators attended Wecht's news conference and served him with a subpoena to turn over his autopsy report to a grand jury reviewing the case. A police spokeswoman in response to the autopsy said any information and evidence that comes up will be included in the investigation, which local and federal prosecutors will review. A preliminary autopsy by St. Louis Medical Examiner Dr. Michael Graham found that Myers was shot six to seven times in the lower extremities, with the fatal shot entering the right cheek. The final autopsy report hasn't been released. The family's attorneys said the autopsy suggests Myers was running away from the officer. Myers' parents attended the autopsy announcement but did not comment.","Jason Flanery shot and killed VonDerrit Myers Jr. in St. Louis in October just as racial tensions in nearby Ferguson remained high .

"The European Union is being defrauded of more than £4billion a year – 12 times official estimates – a damning parliamentary report claims. Agriculture subsidies, payments for projects in the poorest countries, bribery, corruption and cigarette smuggling are major reasons for the massive losses, said a House of Lords committee. In its latest budget report, the European Commission said that £348million a year was going missing, but members of the Lords’ justice, institutions and consumer protection EU sub-committee said this was an unrealistic estimate. A House of Lords committee has warned fraud against the European Union is likely to be more than £4 billion - 12 times higher than official estimates . It said the areas most susceptible to fraud were the EU's cohesion fund - £176 million - and agriculture - £66 million- which goes to the poorest countries. These included the former Soviet bloc as well as Spain, Portugal, Greece and Cyprus. Cohesion funds were often spent on projects to do with the environment and transport in member states where pay is around 90 per cent or less than the EU average. From bribery and corruption to cigarette smuggling, member states - who administer 80 per cent of the EU's funds - were also failing in their duty to report suspected fraud. The EU has claimed that just £348 million - or 404 million euros - was missing from its budget thanks to fraud. However the real size of EU budget losses annually is likely to be around £4.3 billion - five billion euros - 'or even more', according to The Fight Against Fraud On The EU's Finances published by the Lords' Justice, Institutions and Consumer Protection EU Sub-Committee. Peers also condemned the Treasury for their lack of help with the inquiry after their officials cancelled their appearance before the committee at the last minute, claiming fraud against the EU was outside their scope. Officials have failed to give a realistic assessment of how much money is lost due to fraud from the EU budget every year, the committee has said . The committee said the UK government was not doing enough and called on ministers to set up a single department to combat fraud. A tangled web of EU agencies also led to 'weaknesses' in Europe's anti-fraud system. Committee chairman Lord Bowness said: 'Money is tight for everyone, right across the European Union. It is extremely worrying that so much money is disappearing from the EU's budget without anyone really having a handle on where and why it is happening and - most importantly - who is responsible.' He added: 'That we have no control over how other member states organise their affairs is a given, but what we can - and are failing - to do, is to monitor what is happening on our own doorstep.' The committee was 'alarmed' by the lack of Government engagement or 'seemingly', interest in, a huge problem of EU budget fraud in the UK. Philip Bradbourn, a Conservative MEP, said: 'The hard-hitting report reinforces what Conservative MEPs have been highlighting for a long, long time, that fraud and misuse of money is simply not taken seriously enough within the EU.' Marta Andreason, a Conservative MEP, who recently defected from Ukip, told the committee 'all of the [EU's funding] programmes are vulnerable' to fraud. She said 'criminal elements' were able to 'game the system'. In a separate move yesterday, Tory MEPs refused to rubber stamp the EU's annual accounts in what they described as a 'depressing' ritual. The EU's auditors have found that the overall error rate in the accounts has risen for the third year in a row to 3.9 per cent - despite the European Commission claiming that the situation was 'stable'. Mr Bradbourn said: 'If the commission thinks that this is a stable situation we have part of the explanation for that rising error rate: complacency is breeding contempt for the public purse. 'If what I say sounds familiar it is because we are in a depressingly familiar situation yet again this year. European taxpayers' money continues to be wasted and the European Parliament is still being asked to grant discharge to accounts which have been condemned by the Court of Auditors.' Peers also condemned the Treasury for their lack of help with the inquiry after their officials cancelled their appearance before the committee at the last minute, claiming fraud against the EU was outside their scope . A European Commission spokesman said: ‘The Commission welcomes the report as a positive contribution to further stepping up the fight against fraud on the EU budget. It supports most of the report's recommendations and hopes they will be taken up by UK authorities.The Commission operates a zero-tolerance policy to fraud, and has taken many measures to tighten its stance against it. In the last two years alone, the Commission has put forward over a dozen proposals / initiatives to improve the fight against fraud in EU funds. The Commission is constantly calling on Member States to take their responsibilities more seriously in protecting the EU budget.’","Officials 'failed to give realistic assessment of how much money lost'

"Snails may be considered a French delicacy, but it was in fact Spanish cavemen who discovered the cuisine 10,000 years before their northern neighbours. Hundreds of burnt snail shells were found alongside tools near what were believed to be ancient fireplaces in caves along a cliff in Spain. The find suggests roasted snails were a particular favourite of Palaeolithic humans living in the area between 31,000 and 26,900 years ago. Archaeologists recently found an ancient fireplace (left) and (right) snail burnt shells in a rock shelter in Spain. The find, dating to 30,000 years ago, suggests humans ate snails during the Paleolithic period . The discovery, made at the Cova de la Barriada site on Spain’s Costa Blanca, means our ancestors may have been more discerning eaters than previously believed. Snails were widespread in the Late Pleistocene and Holocene, but it is still unknown when and how they were incorporated into human diets. The delicacy is rich in protein, fat (mainly 'healthy' polyunsaturated fatty acid), iron, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, copper, zinc, vitamins A, B6, B12, K and folate. The researchers behind the new study, published in the journal Plos One, found snail shell remains from 30,000 years ago at the Spanish site near Benidorm. Javier Fernandez-Lopez de Pablo, of Institut Catala de Paleoecologia Humana i Evolucio Social, and colleagues investigated patterns of land snail selection. Scientists found groupings of complete shells from a large land snail species at three areas of the site. The discovery, made at the Cova de la Barriada site on Spain's Costa Blanca, means our ancestors may have been more discerning eaters than previously believed . You might think of Neanderthals as lumbering cavemen who feasted on slaughtered beasts, but new research suggests they preferred far more refined cuisine. Scientists in this latest study believe Neanderthals may have eaten sea slugs, but there isn't much evidence that modern humans ate land-based snails until 20,000 years ago. A separate study of ancient fossilised poo left behind by Neanderthals reveals they also had a diet which featured vegetables and nuts. The 50,000-year-old samples from Spain are the oldest known Neanderthal faecal matter and  suggest cavemen knew the importance of a varied diet. They also looked at where the snail shells were scattered at the site, the shells’ decay, fossilisation process, composition, and age at death by measuring the shell size. They found groupings of complete shells from a large land snail species at three areas of the site, corresponding to different time points 30,000 years ago. Dr Fernandez-Lopez de Pablo said: ‘The adult snails were close to prehistoric human-constructed structures that may have been used to cook the snails, along with stone tools, and other animal remains that were likely roasted in ambers of pine and juniper at 375C.’ The researchers believe that these results point to previously undiscovered patterns of invertebrate use and may highlight a broadening of the human diet in the Upper Paleolithic in the Mediterranean basin. Dr Fernandez-Lopez de Pablo added: ‘In neighbouring Mediterranean areas, eating land snails didn’t appear until about 10,000 years later, which may make these newly found snail shells the oldest known evidence that ancient human populations used them as a food resource in Europe around 30,000 years ago.’ Snails may be considered a French delicacy today, but it was in fact Spanish cavemen who discovered the cuisine 10,000 years before their northern neighbours .","Ancient burnt snail shells were found alongside tools in a Spanish Cave .
The snails may have been eaten by humans 31,000 to 26,900 years ago .
This is around 10,000 years before they were used as food in France .
The discovery suggests Palaeolithic humans had a far more varied diet ."
"Mr Starr has lodged a case and is prepared to sue Karin Ward following her allegation of child abuse . Freddie Starr is suing the woman who accused him of molesting her when she was 14 in a BBC dressing room. The 70-year-old has launched a claim against Karin Ward for 'slander and malicious falsehood'. Ms Ward said that Mr Starr groped her when she appeared on a Jimmy Savile show in 1974. Mr Starr is seeking ‘substantial damages’ as his reputation has been ‘tarnished’. The comedian, who spoke from his home in Warwickshire, lodged the claim at London’s High Court. He told the Sunday Mirror: 'I will not rest until my good name has been cleared by the police and all of those who have publicly defamed me have been taken to court.’ It is thought that he could win damages worth tens of thousands of pounds if successful. Sources close to him have said that Mr Starr feels his reputation has been ruined by the allegations and that his career is now over. They added that it has devastated him financially as he has been unable to find work. Ms Ward, 55, alleged on ITV news in October that he groped her following an appearance on variety show Clunk Click.

"A pub landlady is recovering after being bitten by Britain's most venomous spider, leaving a swollen sore on her arm. Glenda Roots was bitten on her arm and as she slept in a chair. A regular at her pub, The Somerhill, in Tonbridge, Kent posted a picture of the angry red wound on Twitter. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Painful: Glenda Roots was bitten on her arm by what is believed to be a false widow spider . The false widow spider is being blamed for the swollen bite and a hospital is now investigating. David Roots, Glenda's husband, said she was treated at hospital but was now 'doing fine'. She was given antibiotic pills, injected with antibiotics and given a sling for her arm, but the hospital couldn't be sure it was a false widow bite. He said: 'It was serious. The blister that came up on her arm was unbelievable.' Chloe Harding (right) also from Tonbridge posted this image (left) on Twitter which she says is a false widow . He said the poison had also seeped through her body and inflamed another bite on her leg from a 'gnat'. Chloe . Harding, 24, who is also from Tonbridge, also took to Twitter to share a . picture of what she believes to be a false widow spider in her house. She discovered a bright red bite just below her knee and now her landlord is investigating whether there could be a nest in the house. Chloe said: 'I woke up Thursday morning with a bite on my leg which I assumed was a mosquito, but it was large, swollen and made my leg ache all day. 'I spotted a spider - quite unique - by my bed, but didn't think much of it. I went away for the weekend and when I came back on Sunday the same looking spider was now in the kitchen. 'I took a closer look and noticed the skull-like markings on its back and knew it was a false widow. 'I trapped it and left it and by the morning it was dead. Then last night I found a slightly larger false widow climb in my bedroom window. 'My landlord has said he will investigate to see if there is a nest and remove it.' False widow spiders are distinctive for their shiny, black flesh, bulbous bodies, thick legs and skull-like patterns . False widow spiders are distinctive for their shiny, black flesh, bulbous bodies, thick legs and skull-like patterns. Millions of false widows, Britain's most venomous spider, have been found across the UK and the population is believed to be growing. The species has a brown bulbous abdomen with cream markings that look like a skull. They have long legs and can reach about 15mm in size. Also known as steatoda nobilis, the spider is frequently confused for the black widow, which has deadly venom. The false widow was first spotted in the UK in Torquay, Devon, in 1879, and it is understood that it may have made its way to these shores from Madeira or the Canary Islands in a shipment of bananas. The Natural History Museum says that warmer summers mean the spider is spreading northwards through the UK, having been found mainly in southern England.","Glenda Roots was bitten on her arm and as she slept in a chair .

"Dehydration is defined as a shortage of water in the body ¿ but the European Food Standards Authority decided the statement could not be allowed . It may not come as a surprise to many but bottled water can keep you cool and healthy. But it was only today that European authorities made the ruling, which should allow companies to make such claims on their products. It follows a bizarre ruling by the European Commission last week that drinking water does not ease dehydration. The controversial decision - after three years of discussion - led to much head-scratching at advertising companies. Now the European Food Standards Authority have added to the general confusion by approving two claims that bottled water can help keep you both cool and healthy. The EFSA said there was enough evidence to prove water can regulate the body's temperature and help it carry out normal 'physical and cognitive functions.' It is expected that the European Commission will allow companies to make both claims on packaging in the future. What they cannot do is say that it is prevents dehydration - and they face a possible two year jail sentence if they do so. This decision results from an attempt by two German academics to test EU advertising rules which set down when companies can claim their products reduce the risk of disease. The academics asked for a ruling on a convoluted statement which, in short, claimed that water could reduce dehydration. Dehydration is defined as a shortage of water in the body – but the European Food Standards Authority decided the statement could not be allowed. The ruling, announced after a conference of 21 EU-appointed scientists in Parma and which means that bottled water companies cannot claim their product stops people’s bodies drying out, was given final approval last week by European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso. In response Tory MEP Roger Helmer, said: ‘This is stupidity writ large. The euro is burning, the EU is falling apart and yet here they are worrying about the obvious qualities of water. If ever there were an episode which demonstrates the folly of the great European project, then this is it.’ Under British law, advertisers who make health claims that breach EU law can be prosecuted and face two years in jail. The decision was being hailed as the daftest Brussels edict since the EU sent down laws on how bendy bananas should be. UKIP MEP Paul Nuttall said: ‘I had to read this four or five times before I  believed it. Careful consideration: European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso gave final approval to the 21 scientists' ruling this week . ‘It is a perfect example of what Brussels does best. Spend three years, with 20 separate pieces of correspondence before summoning 21 professors to Parma, where they decide with great solemnity that drinking water cannot be sold as a  way to combat dehydration.’ He added: ‘Then they make this judgment law and make it clear that if  anybody dares sell water claiming that it is effective against dehydration they  could get into serious legal bother. ‘This makes the bendy banana law look positively sane.’ The statement on which the eminent EU experts ruled claimed that ‘regular consumption of significant amounts of water can reduce the risk of development of dehydration and of concomitant decrease of performance.’ However the Parma gathering ruled: ‘The panel considers that the proposed claim does not comply with the requirements for a disease risk reduction claim.’ It declared that shortage of water in the body was just a symptom of  dehydration. Dr Andreas Hahn and Dr Moritz Hagenmeyer of the Institute for Food Science and Human Nutrition at Hanover Leibniz University said they were unhappy but  not surprised. ‘We fear there is something wrong in the state of Europe,’ Professor Hahn said. He added that the academics had been trying to test the working of EU food and advertising rules. ‘It was free of charge, there was no apparent red tape attached and it gave  food business operators, whom we regularly advise, a chance to advertise their products in a new way,’ he added. ‘We thought we should give it a try and see  what would happen. ‘But over almost four years, it became clear that the procedure was anything but straightforward. Any company depending on the claim would long have gone  out of business. What is our reaction to the outcome? Let us put it this way: We are neither surprised nor delighted.’ He said: ‘The European Commission is wrong; it should have authorised the  claim. That should be more than clear to anyone who has consumed water in the past, and who has not?’",UKIP MEP Paul Nuttall: ‘I had to read this four or five times before I believed it. This makes the bendy banana law look positively sane’
"Tragic: Anne-Marie Ellement claimed she was branded a liar after saying she was raped by two colleagues . A probe has been launched into bullying claims made by a woman soldier who hanged herself after saying two colleagues raped her. Tragic Anne-Marie Ellement was found dead at Bulford Barracks near Salisbury, Wiltshire, on October 9 last year, shortly after returning from sick leave. New details have emerged about the way the 30-year-old corporal was allegedly bullied by other soldiers after making a rape complaint. She said she was accused of setting up the Royal Military Police pair and was called a 'bitch'. And the role social networking sites may have played in her death will also now be examined, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) today told MailOnline. Newly released details of emails sent by Anne-Marie to friends lay bare her anguish after colleagues accused her of crying rape. Anne-Marie, originally from Bournemouth, was the alleged victim of a drunken sex attack by . two serving soldiers in her unit when they were posted together to Germany. Because the . military policewoman had been drinking and could not . recall the events of the night - except, she said, knowing she had not consented . to sex - the two men were never charged. As a result, Anne-Marie claimed she was branded a liar and accused of making up the allegation. In one email obtained by The Times, Anne-Marie told a friend: 'i was raped by two guys i work with, when i was drunk. 'They admitted to stuff i couldn't even remember, i came back out of my face with nothing on but my cardigan, no jeans nothing, as i had run away.' But when she aired her belief about being raped, she said she was given the cold shoulder by workmates. In another email she wrote: 'Cant wait to get out of here. 'But its true, you know who ur friends are, cos hardly anyone is talking to me. 'Like id make up something this bad destroying my career, and losing all my friends.' The soldier found out soon afterwards that her rape complaint had been dismissed by the Special Investigations Branch, which is part of the Royal Military Police. The Service Prosecuting Authority examined the evidence that had been gathered by the military police - known as the Red Caps - but no further action was taken. Anne-Marie wrote: 'Ive had pretty much a total meltdown here, and the fact ive got f*** all friends here is hell. i feel like ive lost so much.' A Red Cap who spoke to The Times said she overheard a man describing Anne-Marie as a 'bitch' who had ruined his friend's life by 'crying rape'. Inconsolable: Anne-Marie 'never recovered' from her experience of allegedly being raped . Alexandra Barritt, Anne-Marie's mother, claimed the authorities brushed her daughter's claims under the carpet. She told the newspaper: 'Anne-Marie told me how upset she was. 'She was a strong girl but they broke her in the end.' Sharon Hendry, Anne-Marie's sister, said she was a 'shadow of her former self' when she found out the two soldiers accused of rape would not be charged. 'In my opinion Anne-Marie never recovered. 'No one believed her and her friends in the Army had turned on her, thinking she was making it up.' In a statement released today, the MoD said the circumstances surrounding Anne-Marie's death have also investigated by Wiltshire Police and Her . Majesty’s Coroner. The MoD said before Anne-Marie killed herself, she 'received extensive . support from the Army, which continued up until her death'. They added: 'Our thoughts are . with the family of Corporal Ellement at this difficult time. 'All allegations, no matter what their nature, are investigated. 'The Army has a zero tolerance policy to bullying and harassment of its personnel and takes these matters extremely seriously.' An inquest in Salisbury heard Anne-Marie was struggling to cope with working an 80-hour week when she was found hanged. She told friends and family that she was called in on duty on her weekends off and even when she was signed off on sick leave with stress. And she said she was belittled and slated by colleagues for her work, with one even writing criticisms on the social networking site Facebook. She also learned on Facebook that an ex-boyfriend had started seeing someone else. The MoD told MailOnline that the role social networking sites may have played in her death would now be investigated. 'The circumstances surrounding Corporal . Ellement’s death were [also] investigated by Wiltshire Police and Her Majesty’s . Coroner and the inappropriate use of social media was not highlighted . as a significant contributory factor. 'However, in light of the . allegations that have emerged... the Royal Military Police . are examining whether the actions of its personnel were appropriate and . in accordance with wider Army values and standards.' The attack left the young woman a shadow of her former self, her family said. January 2006 Anne-Marie Ellement signs up with the Army. She was 25 . January 2010 Prosecutors reject her claim two colleagues raped her . February/March 2010 Anne-Marie is posted to Bulford Barracks in Wiltshire . October 6, 2011 She has a family meal to mark her 30th birthday . October 9 Anne-Marie kills herself . March 2012 An inquest records a verdict that Anne-Marie took her own life . 'Anne-Marie knew right from wrong and would never try to destroy another person’s career,' said her sister Sharon Hardy. 'She . tried so hard for years to accomplish her dream of joining the Army . that there is no way she would jeopardise her career by lying about two . soldiers in her unit. 'In . my opinion Anne-Marie never recovered from being raped. I do not believe . she was given any follow up support or counselling from her unit . either. 'I think what . caused her the most upset was the fact two men had taken advantage of . her whilst she was intoxicated and no one believed her. Her friends in . the Army had turned on her because they thought she was making it up.' After discovering her body, police found scrawled in lipstick on her bedroom mirror the words 'I’m sorry'. The inquest heard that . Anne-Marie had always wanted to be in the Army and joined the Royal . Military Police in 2006. She served in both . Northern Ireland and Germany before being posted to Bulford Camp after . making an allegation of rape against two male colleagues. While with 158 Provost Company she was described as a 'competent' investigator who was finding her role . as shift commander a 'challenge'. Before . her death, Anne-Maire learned that her ex-boyfriend and . fellow serviceman Robert Neal had started seeing someone else. On . the afternoon of her death she exchanged texts with him in which she . expressed feeling angry, upset and let down by him. Friends described . seeing her sitting on the fire escape appearing teary eyed. In the early evening she was found hanging. She was taken to hospital where she was declared dead shortly after arrival. A post-mortem examination gave the case of death as hanging. In . recording his verdict, Ian Singleton, Assistant Deputy Coroner for . Wiltshire and Swindon, said: 'Anne-Marie had a difficult time in the Army . including an allegation that she was the victim of rape. 'She . was signed off work with stress on September 19 and complained to her . senior officer she felt that she could do nothing right and was not . receiving the credit for the work and long hours she put in.' He recorded a verdict that Anne-Marie took her own life.","Details in newly released emails show despair of military policewoman .

"U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has called on the international community to form a coalition to stop the 'cancer of ISIS from spreading' in an opinion piece for The New York Times. Kerry described the Islamic group, which has become notorious for beheadings and terror campaigns in the Middle East a ‘unifying threat to a broad array of countries’ and he wants to confront it. His article comes just days after President Obama faced a backlash over comments he made suggesting that he ‘did not have a strategy’ to deal with the threat of ISIS in Syria. Scroll down for videos . Coalition: U.S. Secretary of state John Kerry has called ISIS, 'a cancer that must be stamped out,' in an opinion piece written for The New York Times . ISIS, also known as The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria has forcibly and violently grabbed territory across northern Iraq over the summer. The Obama administration is said to be considering its next move and may consider expanding U.S. airstrikes. U.S. airstrikes against ISIS fighters have already slowed their advance. However, Kerry now appears to be keen to get the international community more involved. Fanatics: Islamic State fighters parade . with group's black flags. A UN human rights report says the militant . group conducts a regular Friday ritual of executions, amputations and . lashings in areas it controls . ISIS: A fighter of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) holds an ISIL flag the group has become notorious for beheadings and terror campaigns . Airstrikes: 'Airstrikes alone won't defeat this enemy. A much fuller response is demanded from the world,' Kerry wrote . He said that any further action would require the aid of America’s international allies. Kerry . wrote: ‘With a united response led by the United States and the . broadest possible coalition of nations, the cancer of ISIS will not be . allowed to spread to other countries. ‘The world can confront this scourge, and ultimately defeat it. ISIS is odious, but not omnipotent.’ ‘Airstrikes alone won't defeat this enemy. A much fuller response is demanded from the world,’ Kerry wrote. In an accompanying piece written for The New York Times by Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham, both want President Obama to take military action to stamp out the terror group’s growing threat. The senators urged the President to act immediately. They warned him against ‘Doing too little to combat ISIS’ which they see as a problem. And wrote: ‘Doing less is certainly not the answer now.’ Military force: Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham, want President Obama to use military action to stamp out the terror . group’s growing threat . McCain and Graham suggested that the next move must include a squeezing of ISIS financing. They are also calling for the Iraqi government to include Iraqi Sunnis, rather than pushing them toward terrorist groups. ‘Ultimately, ISIS is a military force, and it must be confronted militarily,’ the senators wrote. But the Government has yet to decide what measures it will take. Senators Mccain and Graham used the piece to criticise the President’s airstrikes saying that ‘they have been tactical and reactive half-measures.’ They wrote: ‘Continuing to confront ISIS in Iraq, but not in Syria, would be fighting with one hand tied behind our back. We need a military plan to defeat ISIS, wherever it is.’ However, the Secretary of State has echoed the remarks made by the President and Press Secretary Josh Earnest who have both called for an international coalition to fight ISIS. International intervention: Barack Obama this week claimed that an international coalition of willing partners would help root out ISIS once and for all .

"At least 39 people were killed on Sunday when an Iran-140 Sepahan Air passenger plane crashed after take-off from Tehran's Mehrabad airport on a flight to Tabas in northeast Iran, state media reported. Initial reports said that all of the 48 passengers and crew had been killed, but state media later reported that some passengers had been injured and transferred to hospital. Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) said that eight or nine had survived and quoted a doctor as saying that one of the injured had regained consciousness. Iranian security forces next to the wreckage of the plane as they secure the scene of the crash . Iranian rescue personnel inspect the site of a passenger plane crash near the capital Tehran, Iran . Bodies of victims of the passenger plane crash near the capital Tehran, Iran, side-by-side . Iran's airlines have been plagued by crashes, which Iranian politicians blame on international sanctions that block the airlines from replacing their ageing fleets. About 14 crashes involving Iranian planes were reported in the decade to January 2011. President Hassan Rouhani ordered a halt to all flights of the Iran-140 pending full investigation, IRNA said. The pilot detected technical issues four minutes after takeoff and tried to return to the airport, state television said, but the twin-engine turboprop crashed on a road at 9.18 am local time. One eyewitness said the plane crashed into a wall. State television said 37 people died instantly, two died on the way to hospital and nine others were undergoing medical treatment.

Officials and relatives of victims stand at the crash site of a passenger airplane in Tehran . The aircraft, an Iran-140 used for short domestic flights, crashed near Mehrabad airport, west of Tehran . The Civil Aviation Authority said the passengers included two infants and three children under the age of 12, IRNA reported. Mashallah Shakibi, 63, a former member of parliament from Tabas was among the fatalities, according to reports from the Iranian state news channel IRINN. One survivor said he was saved by falling through a hole in the plane's body created by a blast. 'The force of the blast threw us out of the plane,' Mohammad Abedzadeh was quoted as saying on IRINN's website. 'Seconds later, I saw the entire plane in flames,' he said through tears. A photograph on IRNA's website showed a huge plume of black smoke billowing over traffic standing at a road intersection. A photograph from the Iranian Student News Agency showed a charred tail fin lying on the ground. The plane that crashed - an Iran-140 - is a locally assembled version of the Antonov-140. Its safety record has come into question in the past. In December 2002, an Iran-140 test flight crashed, killing at least 46 people, including engineers who had helped design it. The government said human error caused the crash, but many expressed worries about the aircraft. More than a dozen large airlines and several fledgling carriers operate in Iran. The state carrier, Iran Air, has a fleet of about 40 planes including nine Boeing 747 jets, some of which were built before the Islamic Revolution in 1979. The safety record for the carriers has led to most Iranian flights being prevented from landing in the EU. Mehrabad is located in a western suburb of Tehran and mainly functions as a domestic airport, although it also serves some international routes.

Many of the Boeing aircraft in Iran Air's fleet were bought before the country's 1979 Islamic Revolution . The plane's black box was found according to IRNA reports. Authorities are investigating the cause of the crash. For years, planes have been kept in service through parts imported on the black market, cannibalised from other planes or reproduced locally, aviation sources say. Iran's four largest carriers - Iran Air, Iran Aseman Airlines, Mahan Air and Iran Air Tours - all have average fleet ages above 22 years, Iranian media have reported. They serve a market of 76 million people. U.S. companies Boeing Co and General Electric Co have said they are seeking to export parts to Iran under the agreement for sanctions relief. The chief of Iran Air said the airline will need at least 100 passenger jets once sanctions against the country are lifted.

"Tragic: Leila Fowler was found stabbed to death in her own home in Valley Springs, California, last month . A rural California community was on lockdown Monday, two days after a mysterious intruder stabbed an 8-year-old girl to death at home before being spotted by her 12-year-old brother. Leila Fowler was found stabbed to death in the family home in Valley Springs, California on Saturday. According to police, the boy . encountered the intruder who immediately fled leaving the bloody . evidence of his crime for the terrified child to find. He called 911 and she was later pronounced dead at hospital. Residents in Calveras County have . been ordered to lock their doors as deputies search for the suspected . killer, who is described as a white or Hispanic male with long gray . hair. He is believed to be at least six feet tall and was last seen wearing a black long-sleeved shirt and blue pants. A neighbor said he spotted the suspect fleeing shortly after the 911 call. Police officers from neighboring areas have been called in to help as authorities hunt down the suspect. With the suspect still on the loose, some of the kids in this enclave nestled in the Sierra Nevada foothills were hunkering down after school at James Barci's ranch. 'Nobody is staying alone,' said Barci, a truck driver and parent volunteer at Jenny Lind Elementary School, where victim Fowler was a popular third-grader. 'I told my work I'm not coming in, and I'm just going to have all of my kids' friends at the house until this is over.' The apparently random attack has the tightknit community on edge. Parents such as Barci spontaneously showed up Monday at the school of 500 students to give hugs or tie purple and pink ribbons - Leila's favorite colors - to trees on campus. Scroll down for video .

Later Monday, authorities identified the girl's parents while also saying a witness saw a person running from the family home that had a similar description of a man who fled from the home when the girl's brother confronted him. In a hastily called news conference, Calaveras County sheriff's Capt. Jim Macedo identified the father of Leila Fowler as Barney Fowler and the mother as Krystal Walters. The names of the parents hadn't previously been released. As Macedo spoke, Fowler and Walters - both solemn and declining to speak, and with Walters near tears at times - stood in the background. Macedo said Leila's parents wanted to convey their requests that their privacy be respected, but also that a memorial fund had been set up for their daughter. A vigil is also planned for Tuesday night. No suspects have been named, but officials said a second witness saw someone with a description similar to one provided by Leila's brother of a man who ran from the home when the boy confronted him. Investigators have also checked registered sex offenders in the area and parolees.

'I drew the line at that. We've always had one gun loaded in the house at all times, but now we have four.' The . sheriff's office has released little information about the killing . other than a vague description of a man with long gray hair. Calaveras County Deputy Coroner Steve Moore said the girl died from multiple stab wounds. The . Fowler family's hillside street is blocked off as a crime scene, since . nobody knows for sure how the intruder arrived or where he went. Violent . crime is so rare in the community of 7,400 people that even law . enforcement officers have to stop and think when asked about the last . time there was a stranger killing in the area.

Part . of the school-guided grieving process included classrooms taking turns . writing notes to Leila and hanging them on the fence at the entrance to . the school. They came in somber groups and attached their notes one by . one. 'Dear Leila: You were a fun person and very smart. I enjoyed being around you every minute,' one girl wrote.

"Russia came close to nuclear disaster when a blaze engulfed a sub carrying atomic weapons - despite official assurances that it was not armed, it was reported today. Russian officials said at the time that all nuclear weapons aboard the Yekaterinburg nuclear submarine had been unloaded well before a fire engulfed the 550ft-long vessel and there had been no risk of a radiation leak. But the respected Vlast weekly magazine quoted several sources in the Russian navy as saying that throughout the fire on December 29 the submarine was carrying 16 R-29 intercontinental ballistic missiles, each armed with four nuclear warheads. Scroll down for video . Massive blaze: The fire aboard the Russian nuclear submarine was eventually extinguished . Smouldering: It remains unclear whether the crew members were trapped by the flames or ordered to remain behind in the sub . 'Russia, for a day, was on the brink . of the biggest catastrophe since the time of Chernobyl,' Vlast reported. The 1986 disaster in modern-day Ukraine is regarded as the world's . worst nuclear accident. Neither the Russian Defence Ministry . nor the office of Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, who has . responsibility for military matters, would immediately comment on the . report. A spokesman for the navy could not be contacted. A Defence Ministry spokesman insisted there was never any danger of the fire spreading inside . President Dmitry Medvedev gave assurances that there was no radiation leak and that the vessel's nuclear-tipped missiles were not on board . The huge fire which engulfed the . Yekaterinburg nuclear submarine is the latest catastrophe to afflict . Russian submarines in recent years. In November 2008 20 Russians choked to death on poisonous gas on board the Nerpa nuclear submarine. The . men suffocated when faulty firefighting equipment went off by mistake . while the new craft was carrying out underwater tests in the Sea of . Japan. In August 2003, two member of a 10-man crew on a Russian K-159 sub died when the vessel sank in the Barents Sea. The . submarine's nuclear reactor was shut down at the time the vessel sank . about three nautical miles north west of Kildin Island. But by far the worst Russian sub disaster in recent memory happened on the Kursk (pictured above) in August 2000. An explosion during exercises sent the nuclear sub to the bottom of the Barents Sea, killing all 118 men on board. Russia refused offers of help from Britain and the United States and a Russian rescue attempt failed . The fire started when welding sparks . ignited wooden scaffolding around the 18,200-tonne submarine at the . Roslyakovo docks, 900 miles north of Moscow and one of the main . shipyards used by Russia's northern fleet. The rubber covering of the submarine . then caught fire, sending flames and black smoke 30ft above the stricken . vessel. Firemen battled the blaze for a day and a night before . partially sinking the submarine to douse the flames, according to media . reports. Vlast reported that immediately after . the fire the Yekaterinburg sailed to the navy's weapons store, an . unusual trip for a damaged submarine supposedly carrying no weapons and . casting doubt on assurances that it was not armed. 'K-84 was in dock with rockets and . torpedoes on board,' the magazine said, adding that apart from the . nuclear weapons the submarine was carrying torpedoes and mines as well . as its two nuclear reactors. The magazine said that if one of the . torpedoes had exploded it could have threatened the nuclear missiles, . leading to an extremely dangerous nuclear accident. Media reports of what happened at the . time of the fire were contradictory and foreign journalists were unable . to gain access to the high security zone. Russia's worst post-Soviet submarine . disaster was in August 2000 when the nuclear submarine Kursk sank in the . Barents Sea killing all 118 crewmen aboard.

"Two friends have died after one was shot dead in a struggle over a handgun and the other then turned the gun on himself. Witnesses report one man was trying to disarm another in the incident that occurred early on Sunday morning in Willowbrook, Los Angeles, California.

"It's one of the home cook's fiddliest chores. Attempting to deseed a pepper as the little pips ping across work tops and onto the floor is a messy job - and just one rogue seed can leave a bitter taste in the mouth. But now the chore could be a thing of the past as the world's first seedless pepper has gone on sale. Marks & Spencer is to be the first retailer to sell the pepper, which has been created as the result of a 15 year project with Melrow salads and seed house Syngenta. Groundbreaking: Grown in Southern Spain, Israel and the Netherlands, the new seedless Angello¿ baby pepper is a completely new variety that is extra sweet and extra crunchy . Convenient: The pepper has been naturally bred to have no seeds at all . The natural breeding programme - not a trace of GM here - resulted in a completely seed-free fruit that, in a happy coincidence, also has a sweeter taste than any other pepper currently on the market. The trademarked Angello pepper is not only seedless, but also contains a 25 per cent higher level of brix (commonly used to measure sweetness in fruit and vegetables) than ordinary peppers. The combination makes the Angello ideal not only for cooking, but for snacking, picnics and children's lunchboxes. Seed-free and sweet: The new peppers were 15 years in the making and are said to be perfect for snacking and lunchboxes . Zeina Orfali, M&S peppers expert, comments: 'We know that seeds in . peppers can be a real pain for our customers who want to enjoy them . straight from the pack or cook speedy suppers with them, so we decided . to develop the first seedless pepper so our customers can enjoy this . delicious vegetable on the go – no need to deseed.' The store's grower, Bernard Sparkes, said it was a pleasure to work with M&S on such special projects. 'It’s really exciting to introduce an . amazing new variety of vegetable to the high street,' he said. 'Not only does it . save time, but it tastes delicious, better than any other pepper on the . high street. 'We hope M&S customers enjoy the pepper as much as we . have developing it.' Luciano Fioramonti, Syngenta Business Manager added: 'We hope that we’ll . be able to convert people who don’t normally like peppers with our . delicious Angello™, it’s the ultimate healthy convenience food!' Grown in Southern Spain, Israel and the Netherlands, the new sweet . seedless Angello™ baby pepper is a completely new variety of pepper, . that is extra sweet and extra crunchy.

"Scientists have met to discuss the possibility of bringing back 24 animals back from extinction. But a real life Jurassic Park is not an option, it is said, because dinosaur DNA is just too old. The so called 'de-extinction' of a number of species was discussed at a TEDx conference in Washington DC sponsored by National Geographic. The Dodo evolved without any natural predators, but it was forced into extinction by humans who killed them all for food. It is one of 24 creatures  recently discussed during a TEDx conference on bringing animals back from extinction - also known as 'de-extinction' Another animal considered for 'de-extinction' at the TEDx conference was the Quagga - a species of plains Zebra that once lived in South Africa. The last wild one was shot in 1870 and the last in captivity died in 1883 . They included the dodo bird, the Carolina Parakeet, last seen in 1904 in Florida, and the Quagga, a plains zebra which once lived in South Africa. The last wild one . was shot in 1870 and the last in captivity died in 1883, the Journal reports. The teams chose the animals using a number of criteria, and discussed the ethics of bringing them back to life. They discussed whether the species . were desirable, if they held an important ecological function or if they were beloved by humans. They also discussed if they were practical choices, and if there would be access . to tissue with good quality DNA samples or germ cells in order to reproduce the species. They also considered whether they are actually able to be reintroduced into the world and what the reasons for extinction were in the first place. This month’s National Geographic explains how de-extinction works - by taking old DNA samples and reassembling them into a full genome. This is then injected into embryonic cells which have had their own DNA taken out, and a suitable living surrogate is found to give birth. The docile, flightless moa stood 12ft high. They died out because of over hunting by the Maori . The Woolly Mammoth, related to the elephant, lived on Wrangel Island in the Arctic Ocean until 4,000 years ago. Scientists are hoping to use well-preserved DNA from a frozen woolly mammoth carcass to bring the species back from the dead . According to the Washington Post, ten years ago, a team of scientists from France and Spain brought back an extinct wild goat – but it only lived for 10 minutes. De-extinction does however raise a number of ethical and logistical questions, including how scientists can get a usable DNA sample from an extinct animal, and also whether they should. The Ivory Billed Woodpecker was last seen in the southeastern United states, but there hasn't been a confirmed sighting of the bird since the 1940s . The Thylacine, or Tasmanian Tiger, is the only marsupial to make the list. It lived in Australia, Tasmania and New Guinea until the 1960s . But dinosaur DNA has long ago degraded, so researchers say they are fairly sure that a real life Jurassic Park will never happen . In the hit 1993 film, Richard Attenborough hires scientists who use dinosaur DNA taken from a mosquito preserved in amber to clone the animals and create a theme park. The resulting chaos showed that man and dinosaur should not co-exist. Last year a controversial Australian billionaire was believed to be drawing up secret plans for a real life Jurassic Park. Mining magnate Clive Palmer, who has already embarked on a project to rebuild the Titanic, was rumoured to be working with the team who created Dolly the sheep. It was said the park would be based at Palmer's super resort in Coolum. But the research has shown the dinosaurs may have to stay on the big screen - as their DNA is just too old to be able to use for de-extinction. The cost of de-extinction varies by species but it is believed could run into hundreds of thousands of dollars. It comes after scientists used cloning technology to attempt to bring back a frog from extinction by implanting a 'dead' cell nucleus into a fresh egg from another frog species. The resulting embryos lived for just a few days. But the groundbreaking research by the Lazarus Project has brought the 'de-extinction' of creatures like woolly mammoths to the forefront of scientific discussion. In repeated experiments over five years, the researchers used a laboratory technique known as somatic cell nuclear transfer. Using a method similar to that imagined in the blockbuster Jurassic Park, they took fresh eggs from the distantly related Great Barred Frog, deactivated their nuclei and replaced them with genes from the extinct frog. Some of the eggs spontaneously began to divide and grow to early embryo stage – a tiny ball of many living cells from a creature extinct for 30 years. Although none of the embryos survived beyond a few days, genetic tests confirmed that the dividing cells contain the genetic material from the extinct frog.","Species include dodo, the Carolina Parakeet, and the Quagga, a plains zebra .

"Nasa experts have found evidence that large-scale asteroids have struck Earth three to ten times more often over the past decade than previously thought. The evidence, which will presented by three former Nasa employees, including two astronauts, will reveal the full extent of the explosions which they claim have shaken countries across the world. At the event, experts will announce that the only thing 'preventing a city-killer size asteroid is blind luck'. Scroll down for video . This map shows the locations where asteroids have hit the planet from 3.5 million years ago until 2013 . An artists impression of an asteroid colliding with earth. Next week, Nasa astronauts will reveal the full extent of the explosions which have shaken countries across the world . The presentation, due to be held the . same day as Earth Day, which reminds people of the importance of . protecting the environment, will reveal the findings of the nuclear weapons warning network. Asteroids are sometimes referred to as small planets and there are believed to millions in the solar system. They are solid and formed of rock-like material, thought to have been left over from the time the planets were first formed. The group says that since 2001 it has detected 26 explosions, which it claims are down to asteroids hitting the planet. The only reason, the group claims, that the explosions have not been in the public eye is because they have taken place in remote locations. Phys.org revealed that the group, named B612 Foundation, will present its findings at Seattle's Museum of Flight. The Chelyabinsk meteorite contrail was seen in the sky above the Russian city. The meteor injured hundreds of people . The meteorite left a 20-foot hole in a frozen lake where it fell outside the city of Chelyabinsk in Russia . A recent press release from the foundation's CEO, Ed Lu, a physicist who worked for Nasa until 2007, states: 'This network has detected 26 multi-kiloton explosions since 2001, all of which are due to asteroid impacts. 'It shows that asteroid impacts are NOT rare—but actually three to 10 times more common than we previously thought. 'The fact that none of these asteroid impacts shown in the video was detected in advance is proof that the only thing preventing a catastrophe from a 'city-killer' sized asteroid is blind luck. The goal of the B612 Sentinel mission is to find and track asteroids decades before they hit Earth, allowing us to easily deflect them.' An illustration of an asteroid heading towards Earth. One asteroid, believed to have hit Earth 3.26 billion years ago, was 36 miles wide, which scientists said was six times bigger than the blast which wiped out dinosaurs . Mr Lu will present the findings with Space Shuttle astronaut Tom Jones and Apollo 8 astronaut Bill Anders. Most of the recorded asteroid impacts happened millions of years ago. One asteroid, believed to have hit Earth 3.26 billion years ago, was 36 miles wide, which scientists said was six times bigger than the blast which wiped out dinosaurs. Researchers said that the impact of the asteroid would have boiled oceans, burned the sky, and caused the planet to shake for 30 minutes. More recently, in February 2013, an asteorid, believed to have been 19-metres wide and weighing 100,000 tonnes, hit the province of Chelyabisk in Russia injuring hundreds of people. The asteroid was the biggest to have hit Earth in 100 years. In February 2014, a 270 metre asteroid, the size of three football pitches, also sped past the earth.

"In a tense standoff with an increasingly impatient White House press corps, President Obama's chief spokesman refused to answer a yes-or-no question about whether the president still has 'confidence' in Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki. During a press briefing on May 19, Jay Carney stated flatly that 'the president has confidence in Secretary Shinseki.' But on Thursday he dodged a point-blank dare to repeat that endorsement. And he calmly offered a contradictory set of guidelines about actions the VA and the White House should take in response to the brewing veterans' health care scandal. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . YES OR NO? White House press secretary Jay Carney ducked and dodged questions about VA Secretary Eric Shinseki's job security, refusing to repeat assurances from ten days ago about President Obama's confidence in the decorated war hero . Hot seat: Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki presides over a VA system whose medical centers have let dozens of veterans die while they waited to see doctors for the first time . 'This is very important,' Carney said just minutes into his briefing on Thursday. 'The VA should not and must not wait for the current investigation of VA operations to conclude before taking steps to improve care.' But moments later he told reporters that President Obama will wait before taking action. 'The . president identified last week that he expected a preliminary report . from Secretary Shinseki's internal audit very soon,' instructed Carney. 'And once he receives . that he'll be able to evaluate those findings along with what we're . seen in the interim report from the inspector general, and then assess . where we are at that time.' Realistically, that could come by the end of the weekend, though – giving Obama 'a whole lot more facts,' Carney said, about the agency's internal corruption. 'We'll be very interested in the results,' Carney assured reporters. On Wednesday the VA's inspector general released its own separate preliminary report showing that veterans in Phoenix, Arizona waited an average of 115 days for a first medical appointment, and that 1,700 of them were left off of waiting lists and denied care entirely. About 40 veterans died while waiting to see doctors. Toward the end of an hour-long rhetorical kabuki dance on Thursday, an ABC News reporter asked Carney 'a very simple yes-or-no question: Does the president have confidence in Secretary Shinseki?' Carney dissembled and drew from a briefing book full of talking points. 'The . president believes that – and is confident that Gen. Shinseki has served . his nation admirably, heroically as a soldier, as a general, and that . he has accomplished some very important things as secretary of veterans . affairs,' he said. 'And I listed them, but they include extending education . benefits, reducing veterans' homelessness, and reducing the backlog for . disability claims while expanding vastly the number of veterans who can . make a claim.' Glutton for punishment: Carney (L) seen exiting Marine One with National Security Adviser Susan Rice (R), is Obama's dedicated spear-catcher -- and has been fielding tough questions as the VA scandal deepens . Tensions: Congressional Republicans verbally flayed a trio of VA officials Thursday night in a rare evening hearing on Capitol Hill. 'Veterans died!' the House VA Committee's chairman barked at one. 'Get us the answers!' 'FIRE HIM!': Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain has led a parade of four dozen members of Congress who are demanding Shinseki's ouster . 'But does the president right now have confidence in Secretary Shinseki?' the reporter parried. 'Yes or no? It's a very simple yes-or-no question.' Carney said he wouldn't 'improve on' Obama's words from a May 21 briefing, dismissing questions as 'wordplay.' Obama, however, was never asked directly whether Shinseki's job was safe. Carney began his regular briefing more than an hour after its originally scheduled starting time. Despite the VA scandal hanging in the air, he opened up with a soliloquy about nutrition. Support for the secretary has eroded on Capitol Hill, with nearly 50 members of Congress calling for his ouster. Many are Democrats facing tough re-election battles in states where Republicans dominate the electorate.","White House press secretary balks at 'simple yes-or-no question'

But in the same breath, he said Obama will wait until two separate investigations are over before deciding what to do .

"A pretty pot plant might make a clinical work space feel more personal, but new research has revealed that office plants do so much more as they can help staff be more creative and productive, which could ultimately result in promotion. At work, humble houseplants have been proven to aid concentration, increase productivity and boost staff wellbeing by 47 per cent, according to a study undertaken at this year’s Chelsea Flower Show. The results showed that allowing staff to make design decisions in a workspace enhanced with office plants can increase creativity by 45 per cent and boost productivity by 38 per cent. The results from the study show that allowing staff to make design decisions in a workspace enhanced with office plants, can increase creativity by 45 per cent and boost productivity by 38 per cent . The study, designed by the Identity Realisation research group at the University of Exeter, in association with Indoor Garden Design, compared people’s effective output across different types of business space. A total of 350 visitors to the horticultural show were asked to measure their creativity, happiness and productivity in four differently designed work environments in a series of 90 experiments. The researchers believe their findings demonstrate that plants are not unnecessary elements of business environments and add weight to other studies, which indicate plants increase psychological comfort and business performance. Previous studies have shown plants improve health, happiness and productivity . Psychologist Dr Craig Knight from the University of Exeter said: ‘We have previously shown that designing your own workspace improves health, happiness and productivity. ‘It was time to go a step further and see whether the principle can also be applied to creativity and indeed whether the very act of designing the workspace can be used effectively. ‘Results at the show demonstrated how creativity can be increased by 45 per cent through improving the psychological well-being and design of a working environment. ‘The results from the Chelsea Flower Show experiment indicate that plants, in a well-designed and personalised office environment can boost business effectiveness through improved staff productivity and creativity. ‘This gives company managers a real incentive to share control of office space with their staff and create meaningful, less didactic and more grown up space.’ Plants have previously been proven to have positive effects in hospitals, where patients with pot plants close by said they experienced less pain, anxiety and tiredness, while houses with plant-filled rooms contain between 50 and 60 per cent fewer bacteria than other rooms without plants. Monique Kemperman from The Joy of Plants, said: ‘Scientific studies have demonstrated that we can see a marked improvement in air quality alone, just by dotting a few common houseplants around a room. The organisation wants to encourage everyone in the UK to add a houseplant to their home and office and claims it will make a ‘significant’ impact to people’s quality of life on a daily basis. At work: Houseplants are proven to aid concentration, productivity and reduce sick days, according to the TNO Quality of Life study. In schools:  Having plants in a classroom can boost the learning potential for students, according to the Royal College of Agriculture. In hospitals: Hospital patients with plants in their room have less pain, anxiety, and fatigue, take significantly less pain medication, have lower blood pressure and heart rates, and are happier with their recovery rooms than patients without plants, researchers from Kansas State University said. In homes:  Plant-filled rooms contain 50-60 per cent fewer airborne moulds and bacteria than rooms without plants.  They literally suck out chemicals in the air that could be linked to colds, breathing problems and even cancer, according to the Stennis Space Centre. To the environment: Nasa said houseplants can remove up to 87 per cent of air toxins in 24 hours.

"A couple whose £1,000 holiday to Tenerife was ruined by building work have been awarded a full refund by Thomson - after originally been offered a £30 holiday voucher. Jordan Pedelty and Dee Kimmings, from Slaithwaite, West Yorkshire, say they were woken at 7am every morning by drilling and banging at the Columbus Aparthotel, Playa de las Americas, Tenerife. When booking the week-long holiday with Thomson, the couple say they were not warned about any building works taking place at the resort during their break. Scroll down for video . Jordan Pedelty and Dee Kimmings have now been awarded a full refund for their ruined Tenerife holiday . After MailOnline Travel reported yesterday on the holiday company's paltry offer to compensate a holiday from hell, the travel company has agreed to a full refund. 'It's unbelievable really, I'm just so pleased we have finally got the money back,' a Mr Pedelty said.. 'They have said they will transfer the full amount, and we have 28 days to accept the offer, which we will. 'It's the right thing in the end; we had already booked another holiday for the six-week (school) holidays in the summer, so this will really help with that.' Mr Pedelty's anger grew when he found other holidaymakers had received a discount due to the work . Mr Pedelty snapped the builders in action at the Columbus Aparthotel, Playa de las Americas . Mr Pedelty added: 'There was banging and drilling, it was just a nightmare. If you've had a night out you don't want to be woken at 7am. 'We couldn't even go to the pool because it was too noisy. 'What made it worse was when we were chatting to other holidaymakers they, they all said they were told about the building work and had got a reduced price because of it. 'That just made us feel even worse.' Other guests at the Columbus Aparthotel were warned in advance of the building works . Builders were snapped by Mr Pedelty as he tried to relax by the pool with his partner . Around 30-40 rooms at the Columbus Aparthotel were being worked on, according to Mr Pedelty . Mr Pedelty estimates that 30-40 rooms were being renovated during their trip - and he took photographs of the work being carried out and also took footage which captures the noise. After contacting Thomson to complain about the noise that disrupted their stay, Mr Pedelty claims they were originally offered £30 in holiday vouchers. A gesture from the Thomson shop in the Kingsgate Centre in Huddersfield topped this up to £130 in total, and then an offer of £300 was made. A spokesperson told MailOnline Travel: 'Thomson is sorry to hear that Mr Pedelty was unhappy with his holiday accommodation in Tenerife. 'Unfortunately, due to a system error, notification of the building work was not sent to Mr Pedelty prior to departure. However, every effort was made to position him in a room as far away from any disruption as possible. We are in contact with Mr Pedelty directly to resolve his complaint. 'We would like to reassure customers that this hotel remains a popular choice with guests.' .","Jordan Pedelty and Dee Kimmings say holiday was ruined from the start .

"The tail end of an Atlantic tropical storm called Bertha is heading towards the UK and could hit Britain with heavy rain and winds at the start of next week. Bertha was today close to the Bahamas and is predicted to develop into a hurricane later this evening. Forecasters believe the storm will head north staying offshore from the east coast of the U.S. before swinging out and across the Atlantic. Today Bertha was close to the Bahamas and is predicted to develop into a hurricane later this evening . At the moment the storm looks like it will head in the direction of the UK and continental Europe. If the storm continues the way it is going, it likely Britain will experience a summer storm from the start of next week including heavy rain and strong winds. 'One certainty is that as the storm heads north away from the very warm seas which drive its power, it will lose strength and become what's known as an extra-tropical storm – so we won't be seeing a 'hurricane in Europe', but there is a chance we could see a fairly active summer storm. 'The development of extra tropical storms can present complexities for meteorologists, and Bertha is a good example of that. Families enjoy the warm weather at Sunny Sands Beach, in Folkestone, Kent today . 'In the case of Bertha each of the models we use gives a very different picture of what the storm will do. 'This ranges from Bertha heading towards France as a weak feature which will completely miss the UK, to it arriving as a fairly active summer storm. 'In terms of timing, there's also a spread of possibilities – but it looks likely that the earliest Bertha would affect the UK would be on Sunday or into the start of next week.' According to the Met Office, today and tomorrow will be sunny but heavy rain will hit the UK on Wednesday . The Met Office will be keeping an eye on the storm and will be offering advice on what Bertha is likely to do over the coming days. Nicola Maxey, a spokesman at the Met Office, said that the storms would not be on the same scale experienced across the UK last October when Britain was battered by St Jude's Storm with winds of up to 90mph. Meanwhile, today and tomorrow is set to remain sunny with temperatures in their mid-20s. Prince Harry attended a First World War memorial service where balloons with poppies were let into the sky . According to the Met Office most parts of the UK will enjoy some good sunny spells today but scattered showers are likely to develop in the afternoon, perhaps heavy and thundery in places, especially over Kent. It will be feeling warm in the sunshine with a maximum temperature of about 24C. Tomorrow will also be sunny at first but cloud tending to increase by the afternoon. It will be dry for most of the day but a few showers are likely later with a maximum temperature of 24C. However, most parts of the UK will experience showers on Wednesday with heavy rain in the south of England. The band of rain should pass quickly with sunshine appearing again on Thursday. Experts say this pattern was probably caused by ice crystals forming round an aeroplane . Experts at the Met Office have said this is a holepunch or fallstreak cloud. It forms when part of the cloud layer forms ice crystals which are large enough to fall. Aircraft punching through this cloud layer can cause air to expand and cool as it passes over the aircraft wings or propeller. This change in temperature can be enough to make the supercooled droplets to freeze and fall from the cloud layer in this distinctive pattern.

"A near collision between a passenger plane and an unregistered drone at Perth Airport has left investigators baffled, it emerged today. The Australian Transport and Safety Bureau released a statement confirming that they were unable to identify the operator of the craft nor any details about the object. The incident happened on March 19 and involved a Skippers Aviation De Havilland DHC-8 which was at 3,800 ft above sea level and preparing to land when the crew spotted a bright strobe light directly in the plane's path. The pilot of a Skippers Aviation De Havilland DHC-8 plane was forced to swerve when an unidentified object believed to be a drone, was spotted directly in front of the plane on March 19 . The plane was flying at 3,800 ft above sea level towards Perth at the time of the incident, despite regulations requiring drones to fly  below 400 feet . The pilot swerved, missing the object by about 20 metres horizontally and 100 feet vertically, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau said in a report released on Monday. Crew believed that the light was attached to an unmanned aerial vehicle and the pilot described it as cylindrical in shape and grey in colour. As the airspace below 3,500 feet was military restricted airspace, the ATSB also spoke to the Australian Defence Force who confirmed it was not operating drones and was not aware of any operations at the time of the incident, which happened at 9.13am. The incident was followed by another three days later when the Westpac rescue chopper, carrying five crew, took off from Newcastle's John Hunter Hospital. A white light was spotted coming from a drone hovering 1,000 feet above Hunter stadium where a football match was underway. The incident has come during a time of increasing complaints about the poorly regulated drones, which can be easily bought online . The unmanned craft began to move directly toward the helicopter, requiring the pilot to take evasive action. The ATSB could not find the operators of the drone. 'These people might just be having some fun ... but they are breaking the rules,' investigations manager Neville McMartin said. Regulations set by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, state that unmanned aerial vehicles must operate below 400 feet and at least 5 kilometres away from any airport. The incidents have come at a time when authorities are noticing an increase in incidents involving unmanned aircraft. ASA said the majority of complaints about drones relate to 'first person view' aircraft, which have a fixed video and are controlled by a person on the ground watching a live feed. The ATSB received its first report about an unmanned craft in October 2012 when operators lost control of an airship which drifted into the exclusion zone of Moorabbin Airport. In September 2013 a drone conducting aerial photography in regional Victoria came close to colliding with an agricultural plane. 'You can buy these things online and have them delivered to your home,'Mr McMartin said. 'These reports are a sign of things to come. There are a whole lot of issues we have to work through.' Commercial drone operators are required to be licensed by CASA.","The pilot of the plane was forced to swerve to avoid the object when crew noticed it directly in the aircraft's path .

"Andrew Smith is facing jail over having sick cartoon pictures of Bart Simpson having sex with his sister and mother . A pro-incest campaigner is facing jail over sick cartoon pictures of Bart Simpson having sex with his sister Lisa and mother Marge. Andrew Smith, 55, from Kendal, in Cumbria, claimed the images were research for a book he was planning to write about why he thinks incest should be made legal. Other images showed Bart having sex with his teacher Mrs Krabappel as well as his best friend Millhouse having sex with his mother. In a statement to Carlisle Crown Court, Smith said he wanted to promote ‘the enjoyment of sex and loving relationships within families. He added: 'I want it to be accepted that sexual relationships between brother and sister, father and daughter and mother and son should be decriminalised.' Smith, who is a full-time carer for his 87-year-old mother, was found guilty of nine counts of possessing prohibited images of children as young as eight, after 36 sketches, drawings, cartoons and computer-generated images, many showing sexual relationships between children and older relatives, were found on disks at his home. He said: 'I was researching the legitimacy of incest and downloaded the images to show that from an artist’s point-of-view incest is love, a wonderful, expressive thing. 'I’m not trying to promote inbreeding or the production of incestuously-conceived children but solely the enjoyment of sex and loving relationships within families. 'I want it to be accepted that sexual relationships between brother and sister, father and daughter and mother and son should be decriminalised.' Smith told the jury he had downloaded the images to ‘enhance’ the book. The pictures included sex scenes between relatives including characters from cartoons such as The Simpsons and King of the Hill. All of the images were cartoons, sketches, drawings or CGIs. None were actual photographs. Smith also told the court his ‘campaign’ included lowering the age of consent for sex to 12 for boys and that a relationship between a 65-year-old man and his 12-year-old granddaughter would be acceptable ‘as long as she wanted it’. He said: 'Homosexuals became legal, lesbians became legal, so now there’s only incest left and I want that to follow.' Roger Baldwin, defending Smith, said: 'He did not download these items with a view to sexual titillation or arousal or anything like that. 'He does not wish to have any sexual activities with any child. 'He was hoping to use these images to form part of this publication, this book, or whatever he was going to produce when he had the time to do it.' The pictures included sex scenes between relatives from cartoons such as The Simpsons . Smith denied using the images for sexual gratification or having a sexual interest in ‘pre-pubescent’ children, saying: 'I hate them. I’d machine gun them all.' However, Tim Evans, prosecuting, questioned why Smith had still not made a start on his book more than a decade after first beginning his ‘research’. He said: 'There’s nothing proper and sensible and indeed certainly not legal about pornographic images of children, whether they be real photos or simulations as these are. 'He takes the view that children can be sexualised, that children can have relationships with adults very, very much their senior and in particular that they can have sexual relationships with their parents, almost irrespective of what the age gap is.' The images were seized from his home in February last year. The images were 'filthy, obscene and very disturbing' Recorder Simon Medland QC . The jury returned a unanimous guilty verdict after less than 40 minutes. Recorder Simon Medland QC branded the images ‘filthy, obscene and very disturbing’ telling Smith he should ‘expect imprisonment’. Smith told the court he lost his virginity at the age of 12 to a 15-year-old girl and said that was why he thought the age of consent should be lowered. He said: 'A child should be able to have sex with any age. They’re not children if they have a full erection.' adding: 'I’m trying to change English law. It’s ridiculous.' Smith has a previous conviction from 1975 when he was 17 and he was prosecuted for criminal damage. In his police interview after he was arrested he accepted responsibility for the images but refused to accept any of them are illegal. He also told police he thought the law was ‘ridiculous censorship’. Smith pleaded not guilty to all nine charges and specifically requested a jury trial so he could bring his campaign to court. He said he found some of the cartoon images ‘funny’ adding: 'If I walked into the pub and showed that to my mates they’d laugh their heads off.' According to Smith his interest in changing the law happened after a gay friend of his was beaten at school. Smith says he went away and read the Buggery Act of 1533 which said anyone who was homosexual should be hanged. His statement read out in court said: 'I was researching the legitimacy of incest and downloaded the images to show that from an artist’s point-of-view incest is love - a wonderful, expressive thing. 'I’m not trying to promote inbreeding or the production of incestuously-conceived children but solely the enjoyment of sex and loving relationships within families. 'I want it to be accepted that sexual relationships between brother and sister, father and daughter and mother and son should be decriminalised.' Smith, who was convicted on nine counts of possessing prohibited images, will be sentenced on August 29 at Carlisle Crown Court.","Andrew Smith from Cumbria, claimed the images formed part of research .

"A former top secret Second World War and Cold War naval communications base in Wales, used to transmit orders for the sinking of the Bismarck and General Belgrano warships, has been sold to four local investors for regeneration. Mystery surrounded Criggion station near Welshpool when it was established in 1943, with speculation over its use only ending when its towers were demolished in 2003. Built during the Second World War, the remote communications hub was rumoured to have been used to keep the Admiralty in contact with Royal Navy ships around the world and to have ordered the sinking of the pride of the German Navy, the Bismarck. Scroll down for video . Criggion station, near Welshpool in Wales, was built during the Second World War and used to beam out messages to Royal Navy ships . Orders to sink the Argentine ship The General Belgrano were carried through Criggion, as were orders to sink the Bismarck in 1941 . These pictures show the building today, after it was abandoned at the end of the 1990s and left to rot . Now the desolate site, once a prime target for a Russian nuclear strike, is earmarked for regeneration. The site comprises of 11.68 acres of land and four separate buildings. The site was available for purchase as a whole or as separate lots. Commenting on the sale, Mark Kelly from commercial real estate agents Telereal Trillium said: 'The community showed a strong interest in the site and we are very pleased that the sale has been completed by four local investors. 'We are confident that the regeneration of the lots will bring life back to the area and will directly benefit the immediate community. 'We are committed to bringing the site back into use so that it can once again make a meaningful contribution to the local area. Bid submissions were received from a number of parties, including members of the local community.' Full details of the sale have not been disclosed, but it has been considered for a variety of uses, including a design studio, industrial storage, conversion to residential buildings and a war museum. A water gauge left unused for many years sits rusted, broken and bent on the walls of Criggion station . Pictured left, old radio transmitting equipment which has been left behind at Criggion station. To the right, three radio masts (like that pictured) which stood at the site were demolished in 2003 . Powys county councillor Graham Brown and members of the local community previously expressed a bid to revamp the old buildings and turn them into a war-related national museum of international importance. He said: 'You would not believe what went on in these buildings that were linked up to Hawaii and Colorado in the USA. 'Orders to sink the Bismark during World War II came from Criggion and it is believed that Margaret Thatcher's direct order to sink the Argentine ship, the General Belgrano, during the Falklands War was transmitted through Criggion. 'The buildings have been left to decay over the past decade but we want to turn them into a museum exhibition which could have both historical and educational value. 'The project has the potential to bring in tourists and could lead to a major economic regeneration of the area.' An undated photo of people working inside Criggion station during its heyday in the Second World War and Cold War . Pictured is Rodney's Pillar, located at the top of the Breidden, which looks down upon the old Criggion building . The centre was built during the Second World War amid fears the Germans could bomb the UK's main communications post at Rugby, Warwickshire. While Criggion was still being tested, a fire knocked out the centre at Rugby, making the Welsh station Britain's foremost naval communications post, sending out orders to our huge fleet of submarines and battleships. The station was used in ordering the sinking of German battleship Scharnhorst in 1943, seen as huge psychological blow for the German high command and the nation as a whole. But it was after the Second World War that the station was at its busiest. It became the top-secret hub of Cold War communications and 160 people worked at the site during the tense 1960s, as messages were beamed across the Atlantic during the Cuban Missile Crisis. As the centre of communications with missile-launching submarines, it was feared the site would be one of the first Russian targets in the event of nuclear war and it soon saw protests by nuclear disarmament campaigners and activists. The centre remained key to Britain's naval communication right up until the end of the 1990s, but its three 700ft-high radio masts and three 600ft-high towers were demolished in 2003.

"A new book of photographs has given a haunting insight into the lives of people who were held in institutions that used to be called 'lunatic asylums' in Britain. Photographer Mark Davis spent more than six years travelling to abandoned former psychiatric hospitals, where patients were treated for a range of mental health problems. His book, Asylum, captures the remains of 17 buildings, including West Riding Pauper Lunatic Asylum, Staffordshire County Asylum, North Wales County Pauper Asylum and West Park Mental Hospital in Epsom, Surrey.

Abandoned: Photographer Mark Davis spent more than six years travelling to former psychiatric hospitals including Lanark District Pauper Asylum at Hartwood Hospital . Deserted: The ballroom at West Riding Pauper Lunatic Asylum at High Royds Hospital in West Yorkshire has been abandoned since its last use several years ago . Mr Davis said: 'These buildings and its patients were often hidden from the public. It is important for us to remember these asylums in order for us to ensure we do not make the same mistakes.' His work on the asylums was sparked by an interest in justice, which caused him to look deeper into the lives of the patients who were usually condemned to spend their entire lives in the institutions. 'What is most shocking about these places is the fact the people actually seemed quite normal,' said Mr Davis. Distressed state: Faded green sheets that would have provided privacy for the patients in their hospital beds at West Park Hospital .

Distressed: An abandoned and dishevelled corridor at West Riding Pauper Lunatic Asylum at High Royds Hospital in Menston, West Yorkshire . 'You only hear of the most grotesque of cases but many people committed to asylums were in there suffering from illnesses such as depression due to loss of a husband, or even their job. 'To make these situations even more harrowing to hear is that once a person entered one of the asylums, it was very likely they would not come out even when cured.' According to Mr Davis, many of the patients were detained if they had useful skills and given roles such as a seamstress or a builder because they would carry out such tasks for free. Dumped: Blankets and other debris from the hospital litter the floor of this room at what was once the North Wales County Pauper Lunatic Asylum .

Abandoned: A painting of a teddy bear and an old wheelchair are a reminder of the people who once lived within the walls of West Park Hospital, Surrey . Place of confinement: West Riding Pauper Lunatic Asylum at High Royds Hospital, Menston, West Yorkshire . Mr Davis began his journey around asylums in 2008 along with other photographers but later discovered going in alone helped him to transcend the atmosphere of each building. He said: 'You would be surprised how easy it is to gain access to certain abandoned asylums. Many had the front door left swinging in the wind for anyone to enter. 'The one that struck me the most was Barrow Gurney Mental Hospital in Bristol. It is surrounded by a creepy woods near these abandoned villas and is the closest thing to being in a horror movie.'

Rotting away: A flooded recreation area where patients would have once gathered to chat at West Park Mental Hospital in Surrey . In 1914, there were 102  registered 'lunatic' asylums across Britain with many of the Victorian structures being beautifully designed. According to the book: 'County asylums were built at a rapid rate to cater for society's intolerance to behaviour and the increasing human wreckage associated with the newly industrialised society.' To some, being committed to an asylum was worse than going to prison with asylums' only having 30 to 50 per cent discharge rate.

Parked up: An abandoned bike left in a room at Cheshire County Pauper Lunatic Asylum . However, some asylums were that well designed that patients found the facilities were of a better standard than their current living conditions. Mr Davis added: 'Many of the patients at these asylums came from poor backgrounds, so when they arrived in such places as West Riding Pauper Lunatic Asylum, who really went to town with the design and mosaics, they were humbled by being there and would do as they were told just to stay.'

"It's been more than ten years since Concorde made its final transatlantic flight. But there's a new generation of supersonic passenger aircraft beginning to emerge, boasting speeds at least twice as fast as current commercial planes. While these planes will first appear in the private and business jet market, catering only to the super rich with gargantuan price tags and first class service, supersonic may eventually reach regular holidaymakers. Scroll down for video . Super-fast: The N+2 jet designed by Lockheed Martin aims to cut the time from New York to LA by half . One such jet, the N+2, designed by US global aerospace Lockheed Martin, is intended for commercial airlines, and aims to cut the travel time from New York to Los Angeles by half - from five hours to just 2.5. The aircraft would accommodate 80 passengers and have a tri-jet configuration in which one engine is on top of the aircraft and the other two are under each wing to reduce sonic boom. 'To achieve revolutionary reductions in supersonic transportation airport noise, a totally new kind of propulsion system is being developed,' said Michael Buonanno, Lockheed Martin manager of the NASA N+2 program. Supersonic: The Aerion AS2  jet will use proprietary supersonic laminar flow technology,  flying at 1,217mph . 'We are also exploring new techniques for low noise jet exhaust, integrated fan noise suppression, airframe noise suppression and computer customized airport noise abatement.' Meanwhile, in Reno, Airbus is teaming up with US-based Aerospace firm Aerion to create a supersonic jet that can fly from London to New York in three hours and from Los Angeles to Tokyo in six. The Aerion AS2 business jet will fly at 1,217mph, using proprietary supersonic laminar flow technology -  almost as fast as Concorde, which flew at 1,350mph. Engineers from Airbus' Defence and Space Division will work with Aerion at its base in Nevada. The cost of the AS2 is thought to be more than $100million - over £60million - and Aerion hopes test flights will begin by 2019. The cost of the AS2 is thought to be more than $100m (£60m) - and test flights will begin by 2019 . The jet, which will fly between major global cities, will be made mostly from carbon fibre composite material. Design features include wings which reduce overall drag by 20 per cent, allowing for lower fuel consumption and longer range and a luxurious 30-foot-long cabin will seat up to 12 passengers. Aerion chairman Robert M Bass, said in a statement: 'This is a major step forward for Aerion. It puts us solidly on track toward our objective of certifying the world's first supersonic business jet in 2021.' After 27 years of service, British Airways retired the Airbus' Concorde airliner - which travelled at more than twice the speed of sound -  in October 2003, signalling the end of the supersonic passenger jet. Interior: A 30-foot-long cabin will seat up to 12 passengers in business-style comfort . Aerospace company Lockheed Martin is behind the ambitious N+2 design. Plane aims to fly from New York to LA in 2.5 hours - half the current five-hour time. The aircraft would accommodate 80 passengers and have a tri-jet configuration. Designer aim to reduce noise caused by sonic boom. Airbus is teaming up with Aerospace firm Aerion to create a supersonic jet. The Aerion AS2 business jet will fly at 1,217mph - 133mph slower than Concorde. Test flights will begin in 2019 for the$100m (£60m) jet. Airbus' Defence and Space Division will work with Aerion at its base in Nevada. Modern commercial long-haul jets typically cruise at speeds between 480mph and 560mph . The plan is to certify the  plane in 2021 with first delivery in 2022. Flight testing would begin in roughly 2019. Aerion officials knew it would take a well-established original equipment manufacturer to complete the project, he said. 'We couldn't be more delighted with the choice of Airbus,' Barents said. 'We think that their footprint around the world is clearly going to help us as we develop the airplane.' Flight testing could begin on the supersonic jet as early as 2019 with it becoming available in 2021 . Billionaire Bass has been open about his personal mission to offer the first business jet to fly faster than the speed of sound, a project begun in 2002. Aerion, Chief Executive Officer Doug Nichols, told CNN: 'The collaboration with Airbus was an essential piece in order to bring the expertise of a premier aircraft development concern into the fold.' The US forbids civilian planes from  the sound barrier - about 750mph per hour - while flying overland due to noisy sonic booms, but the AS2 model will fly at subsonic speeds until it reaches the ocean, when it will speed up. Over Europe it can fly at supersonic speeds without detection.","N+2 jet design is intended for commercial airliners - not just business jets .
New generation of supersonic planes will fly more than 1,200mph .

"President Barack Obama brushed off complaints levied by the GOP that his immigration actions are illegal in an ABC News interview that aired today, saying that the U.S. has 'limited resources' and it only makes sense for the government to prioritize the removal of 'felons, criminals and recent arrivals' over longtime residents and families. 'Everybody knows, including Republicans, that we're not going to deport 11 million people,' Obama told George Stephanopolous during a Friday interview for his Sunday morning program This Week. 'The reason that we have to do prosecutorial discretion in immigration is that we know that we are not even close to being able to deal with the folks who have been here a long time,' he said. In the extended interview Obama and Stephanopolous also discussed the grand jury investigation into Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson and the 2016 presidential race. President Barack Obama told ABC News host George Stephanopolous in an interview that aired today that his main piece of advice to residents of Ferguson would be to 'keep protests peaceful' after the grand jury announces its decision in the case against police officer Darren Wilson . When it comes to Ferguson, the president encouraged the Missouri town's residents to 'keep protests peaceful.' 'This is a country that allows everybody to express their views, but using any event as an excuse for violence is contrary to rule of law and contrary to who we are,' Obama said. The president declined to say whether or not he was worried about outbursts of violence if Wilson is not indicted on criminal charges for shooting and killing local teen Michael Brown, however he noted that protests over the summer showed that there's a 'possibility of even overwhelmingly peaceful crowds being overrun by a few thugs.' He also indicated that he may pay Ferguson a visit, depending on the outcome of the court case, which could be decided as soon as Monday, and the town's response to it. 'In the end what I have confidence in is that if we do a better job of training our law enforcement to be sensitive to the concerns of minority communities, then over time trust can be built in part because minority communities typically are subject to more crime,' he stated. 'They need law enforcement more than anybody. 'And there are a lot of communities in my hometown of Chicago, for example, who actually want to see more police in, but they want to make sure that the police are trained so they can distinguish between a gangbanger and a kid who just happens to be wearing a hoodie but otherwise is a good kid and not doing anything wrong.' Overall, Obama said he believed race relations were improving in America, however. 'In a democracy progress is incremental and it goes in stutter steps and sometimes there's some back-sliding, but the overall trajectory I think is positive,' he concluded. Prodded by Stephanopolous to endorse a successor, namely Democratic frontrunner and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Obama said he didn't want to 'jump the gun.' He did call Clinton a 'friend,' however, and attested that she did an 'outstanding' job at State. Whoever the Democratic nominee ends up being, Obama said it's in his interest 'do everything I can obviously to make sure that whoever the nominee is is successful.' If Clinton runs, she would be a 'formidable candidate,' though, he said. 'I think she'd be a great president.' 'She's not going to agree with me on everything,' he acknowledged, and 'one of the benefits of running for president is you can stake out your own positions and have a clean slate, a fresh start.' Pointing out that after six years he has 'some dings,' Obama told Stephanopolous, 'I think the American people, you know, they're going to want that new car smell. 'They want to drive something off the lot that doesn't have as much mileage as me.' Speaking about immigration, Obama said it only makes sense for the government to prioritize the removal of 'felons, criminals and recent arrivals' over children and families who have been in the U.S. for a long time . Speaking about immigration, Obama again called on the House of Representatives to pass a comprehensive immigration bill that would provide a pathway to citizenship for millions of immigrants residing in America illegally. 'Ultimately Congress has a responsibility to deal with these issues, and there are some things that I can't do on my own,' Obama said. To Republicans complaining that he shouldn't have acted unilaterally, including House Speaker John Boehner, Obama said his response is this: 'Go ahead and pass legislation.' 'In the meantime, what we've got to make sure of is, number one, that our borders are secure and, number two, it's gonna to allow us to focus on the people that we really want out, number three, what it allows us to do is to say to folks who have been here for awhile, register...you're going to submit to a criminal background check, and you're going to pay taxes.' He also chided Republicans for threatening to stop working with him on a host of other issues over his immigration mandate. 'What the American people expect is that if we disagree on one thing, then we disagree on that thing and then we work on everything else,' he argued. House Republicans need to stop holding other legislative fixes 'hostage' over 'one disagreement,' he said, referencing the government shutdown last year over Obamacare funding. Obama formally announced his plans to delay deportations for as many as 5 million illegal immigrants during a presidential address on Thursday evening from the White House. The next day he traveled to Del Sol High School in Las Vegas, Nevada, to celebrate with his supporters. On the way there, he issued two memorandums to the Department of Homeland Security affiliated with his immigration orders. But the president's actions were met with less enthusiasm than he likely expected from some advocates of comprehensive immigration reform who think his executive actions didn't go far enough. While they protect individuals who were were brought to the U.S. as children from deportation as well as the parents of American-born children, his directive will not keep the parents of illegal immigrant children from being sent back to their home countries. President Barack Obama waves to the crowd as he leaves the auditorium at Del Sol High School, in Las Vegas, Nevada, on Friday after his speech on immigration. Roughly 1,600 activists gathered there to thank Obama for deferring deportations for 5 million illegal immigrants . During Friday's speech two young men from Arizona called out the president for not expanding his deferred deportation program to cover the parents of so-called DREAMers, as well. 'Why did you leave my mom behind?' CBS News says they shouted at him. In his response the president assured him that 'this is a just a first step,' and 'it’s not the only step.' 'We’re still going to have to do more work,' he said, explaining that Congress still needs to pass a bill making 'permanent' his changes to the immigration process so that they are not undone by the next president. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said Sunday that Obama practically did give every illegal immigrant residing in America amnesty because the memo he sent DHS 'says they are not to enforce immigration laws other than for violent criminals' and a few other discrete categories. 'The president is instructing the executive branch [to] no longer enforce the immigration laws,' Cruz, a probable Republican candidate for president in 2016, told Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace. 'It is a stunning and sad display of a president declining to honor his constitutional obligation to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.' Cruz said what Obama did last week is 'a wholesale refusal to follow our immigration laws,' and he's 'essentially he's gotten in the job of counterfeiting immigration papers, because there's no legal authority to do what he's doing.' Leading Democrat Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, came out in favor of former boss' actions over the weekend during an appearance at the New York Historical Society. 'I think the president took an historic step and I support it,' she said, according to the Associated Press.","Obama made the remarks during an interview with This Week host George Stephanopolous that was broadcast Sunday .

"The main worry for Nigeria over the past week has not been how on earth they're going to deal with Lionel Messi and Co in Group F, but that Kenneth Omeruo might succumb to a knee injury. A collective sigh of relief was breathed all round when the 20-year-old Chelsea youngster was confirmed fit to start for the Super Eagles in their World Cup bow against Iran. Although set to win just his 18th cap for Nigeria on Monday evening, Omeruo’s assured performances at in the middle of defence have seen him emerge as a crucial element to their plans. In action: Chelseea youngster Kenneth Omeruo was key for Nigeria's defence at the World Cup . Eyes on the ball: Omeruo in training for Nigeria ahead of his summer World Cup campaign . On to big things? Omeruo training for parent club Chelsea against Fernando Torres and Ashley Cole . Only ten days after his international debut last year, Omeruo made his name by performing admirably in every match in Nigeria’s acclaimed run to winning the African Nations Cup. Since then, he’s been a mainstay in the side, helped immeasurably by his loan spell at Middlesbrough last season, able to operate at centre-half or right-back. Far from being forgotten about while in the north east, parent club Chelsea awarded him a new contract last month to keep him at Stamford Bridge until 2018. Plucked from Standard Liege by the Blues in January 2012, Omeruo had to wait until two years – via a loan spell at Dutch side ADO Den Haag – for his debut in English football. Boro used manager Aitor Karanka’s Real Madrid connection with Jose Mourinho to secure the services of Omeruo on loan until the end of the season. Once the Nigerian got his chance, he became a regular fixture for the mid-table side, often featuring alongside fellow Chelsea loanee Nathaniel Chalobah. Reach for the stars: Omeruo will have to face Lionel Messi when Nigeria meet Argentina . Honing his craft: Kenneth Omeruo in action for Middlesbrough, when he stared on loan last season . His uncomplicated style, strength and a level composure belying his lack of experience make him a solid presence at the back, particularly when dealing with the rigours of Championship forwards. These qualities are underpinned by a great pace, leading many to think he has what it takes to step up to a higher level. The World Cup will test that on the biggest stage imaginable. With the Iran clash the least troubling of the opening matches, few expect Nigeria to reach the last-16 at the expense of Bosnia or Argentina. In players like Edin Dzeko and Miralem Pjanic, Omeruo will face the biggest test of his career on Saturday, at least until Wednesday week, when he’ll be tasked with keeping the world’s best attacking talent at bay. On the sidelines: Jose Mourinho will have a keen eye on Omeruo's performances at the World Cup . Even if Nigeria don’t make it through, Omeruo’s performances will be watched carefully by club boss Jose Mourinho. With Tomas Kalas – so assured in his Premier League debut at Anfield – joining the hordes of Chelsea players on loan by signing up with Bundesliga new boys Cologne, there is a place at centre-half available in Chelsea’s squad for next season. If Omeruo continues his rise in Brazil, Mourinho will find his designs on the spot hard to ignore.","Kenneth Omeruo kicks off his World Cup campaign against Iran .

"Savers will go back to storing cash under the mattress if the taxman wins the power to seize money from bank accounts, experts warned last night. They said HMRC’s record of blunders meant it could not be trusted as ‘judge, jury and executioner’ over people’s money. Officials want to be able to take funds directly from the current accounts, joint accounts or ISAs of those owing it money. Scroll down for video . Under new debt recovery powers, officials want to be able to take money directly from the current accounts, joint accounts or ISAs of those who owe money to HMRC . But this ‘could lead to customers thinking their money is not safe and cashing out their savings, leading to a return to cash under the mattress’, says the Building Societies Association. The Institute of Chartered Accountants said HMRC would inevitably make errors that could have damaging consequences. The Law Society, the Federation of Small Businesses and human rights group Liberty have written jointly to the Chancellor urging him to abandon the plans. Around 17,000 people a year would have money seized under the debt recovery powers, all without the need for HMRC to go to court. Official documents reveal it expects to receive £375million from the scheme between 2015 and 2019. It says it will ensure its targets always have at least £5,000 left over after any raid on their accounts. But it is feared worried savers might opt to keep their cash at home, exposing themselves to theft. They would miss out on interest on their money and, in extreme cases, simply forget where they left it. Previous articles: The Mail from May 9, pictured left, and The Mail from May 17, pictured right . It is also likely that tax dodgers – who are the real target for HMRC – might move their money offshore. In its response to a consultation on the scheme, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales said the rules would be side-stepped by the unscrupulous and any mistakes would erode public trust. It warned: ‘Those who intend to avoid paying tax can – once they know that direct recovery of debts is an option – easily side-step it by taking their funds out of their UK bank accounts. ‘HMRC does not explain how it would counteract this simple and obvious strategy. But experts say HMRC, pictured above, cannot be 'judge, jury and executioner’ over people’s money . ‘Introducing the direct recovery of debts could in fact encourage such people to move their funds offshore. ‘The publicity given to any case where the direct recovery of debts is used inappropriately would have a damaging effect on public confidence in the tax system. ‘In the UK, voluntary compliance and trust in the tax system are crucial to the way the system operates. ‘The cost of trust being eroded will far outweigh the sums the direct recovery of debts is expected to yield.’ An online petition on the Government’s website calling for the proposals to be withdrawn has attracted more than 1,800 signatures. Patrick Stevens of the Chartered Institute of Taxation said it was a ‘dangerously bad idea’. ‘HMRC has been known to make mistakes,’ he added. Pressure groups have urged George Osborne to abandon plans which allow HMRC to take funds straight from the accounts of those owing money . ‘The people who are most likely to be hit by this are vulnerable people who are not able to deal with HMRC so well. Other people who are not so vulnerable will just make sure that they do not have enough money in bank accounts that HMRC can get their hands on. ‘We honestly do think it is a bad idea. We are not accusing them of making mistakes all the time – but this is just dangerous.’ In May, David Gauke, the Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, said he recognised there were ‘concerns about the impact of this change on vulnerable members of society’. But he added: ‘We must ensure that there are strong safeguards in place so that this is only targeted at the truly non-compliant.’ Anybody who has money removed from their account will have been contacted a minimum of four times before it is seized. An HMRC spokesman said: ‘A very small number of the country’s many millions of taxpayers refuse to pay what they owe despite being well able to. ‘This is simply unfair to the vast majority. ‘The Direct Recovery of Debt proposals contain numerous safeguards – the average debt is £5,800 and most of the 17,000 taxpayers potentially affected have around £20,000 in cash available to them. ‘Direct Recovery of Debt will level the playing field firmly but fairly.'","HMRC would take funds direct from accounts or ISAs of those owing money .

Sir Alex Ferguson has expressed his happiness at seeing old rival Arsene Wenger win the FA Cup last season - but doubts that the Arsenal manager will surpass his 26-and-a-half-year reign. Wenger is currently the longest-serving manager in the Premier League, having been in charge of the Gunners for 18 years. And Ferguson admitted he was happy for the Frenchman when Arsenal ended a nine-year trophy drought in May with a 3-2 victory against Hull City in the FA Cup final at Wembley. In a new updated version of My Autobiography, Ferguson wrote: 'The model I represented has passed into history. You won’t see anyone manage one club for 26 years. I must say, though, that Arsene Wenger’s reign at Arsenal deserves a special mention. Arsene Wenger (right) lifts the trophy after Arsenal beat Hull City 3-2 in the FA Cup final earlier this year .

'Everyone was happy for him winning the FA Cup. I was hoping Steve Bruce would win it for Hull because he was one of my players; but you also had to have a special feeling for Arsene, given the pressure he was under for not winning a trophy for nine years.' Wenger would have to remain in charge at the Emirates until April 2023 to surpass Ferguson's United reign - something the former Old Trafford boss thinks is unlikely. Ferguson wrote: 'Who is to say that Arsene will not beat my record? I have my doubts, but he’s having a good crack at it.' Ferguson and Wenger had a long-lasting rivalry of more than 16 years, with one of the most famous moments being the 'Pizzagate' incident in 2004. The incident happened when United ended Arsenal's 49-match unbeaten Premier League run. Ferguson had a slice of pizza thrown at him after arguments in the tunnel between players and staff from the two teams. He later admitted he did not know who had thrown it. The animosity led to a Metropolitan Police commander urging the two bosses to end their feud the following year. The rift was eventually healed in 2009 when Wenger invited the United staff into his office at a Champions League semi-final at the Emirates.

"It was once described as a 'building of world significance' and was seen as such a striking example of modern architecture that it was given the highest possible protection for buildings in Scotland. In its 1960s heyday the entire hierarchy of the Scottish Catholic Church attended a ceremony to mark the laying of the foundation stone at St Peter's Seminary near Cardross in Argyll before it was to become a key centre for the training of Roman Catholic priests. But 50 years on the seminary is a ghost of its former grandeur, abandoned and desolate with the once decadent walls covered with graffiti and its distinctive corridors and halls littered with rubbish and overgrown weeds. Scroll down for video . St Peters Seminary in Argyll was once voted Scotland's best building and regarded as of world architectural significance after it was built in the 1960s, but 50 years on the site has been abandoned and left littered with graffiti on most of the walls and rubbish throughout its corridors . St Peter's Seminary was so highly regarded that it was listed category A, the highest level of protection for a building of architectural interest . Trainee priests are no longer seen on the staircases and in rooms of St Peters. Today the abandoned seminary is mostly occupied by the homeless, alcoholics and drug addicts. Winding staircases have been partially destroyed, doorways and walls left to rot and crumble, and discarded stone and litter is all over the floors of the vast site. Most of the woodwork and glass has now disappeared but evidence of the distinctive architecture remains. Now its only visitors are urban explorers, desperate to reinvigorate a building that was once seen as so important in brutalist architecture. The building was officially opened in 1964 after it was built to replace the Roman Catholic seminary previously housed in Bearsden in Glasgow, which was destroyed by a fire in 1946. In 1964 Archbishop Scanlan laid the foundation stone at St Peters, before the entire hierarchy of the Scottish Catholic church. Urban explorers have captured the destruction of the building, with corridors littered with discarded stone and walls left to rot and crumble . The building in Argyll in Scotland has been praised for its modernist design and was afforded the highest protection as a Category A building . Graffiti now covers many walls at St Peters but there are attempts being made to restore it to its former glory and appreciate the architecture . It had a capacity of 100 students but was never full as the number of students joining the priesthood started to decline in the 1960s. The building has been praised for its modernist design by Andy MacMillan and Isi Metzstein of architecture firm Gillespie, Kidd and Coia in the early 1960s. And it was later described as a modern 'building of world significance' becoming one of only 42 post-war buildings in Scotland to be listed at Category A, the highest level of protection for a building of 'special architectural or historic interest'. After it was opened the seminary became part of St Peter's College and was used as a training ground for young priests. It closed in 1980 and was briefly used as a drug rehabilitation centre until it was shut down in 1987. Since then it has been unused, despite attempts to reinvigorate it and try to turn it into something resembling its former glory. The site of St Peter's Seminary in Argyll is surrounded by trees and close to Kilmahew House, which was targeted by arsonists in 1995 . A shot of the building when it was still in use reveals the brutalist architecture which led it to be classed as of world architectural significance . The building was used as training ground for Scottish Catholic priests. Pictured standing outside the seminary are (left to right) Monsignor McMahon, Bishop Thompson of Motherwell, Archbishop James Scanlan, Auxilliary Bishop Winning, Bishop McGill of Argyll and the Isles . It has been occupied by the homeless and luckily escaped an arson attack at nearby Kilmahew House in 1995. But despite being abandoned and on the cusp of ruin, the building has still retained its lure for lovers of architecture. Urban explorers have constantly visited the site during the almost 30 years it has sat abandoned. In 2005 it was voted Scotland's best modern building by the readers of Prospect Magazine. One explorer, who didn't wish to be named, said: 'It's such an incredible structure and it seems mad that it's just been lying empty for all this time. 'Just by walking around, you can tell that it was once this grand building. It's fascinating to see what has happened to the place over the years. Andy MacMillan and Isi Metzstein, who have both since died, designed St Peter's seminary in Argyll which is due to be redeveloped . Mould and weeds cover the walls of St Peter's in Scotland, making it a shadow of its former glory as a thriving part of St Peter's College . The site has been abandoned for almost 30 years after a brief spell when it was used as a drug rehabilitation centre until 1989 when it closed . St Peter's Seminary in Argyll still attracts urban explorers wowed by its architecture and was voted Scotland's best modern building in 2005 . 'I really hope that someone can salvage this after it being dormant for so long.' There have been several attempts to reinvigorate life into the building with the most recent effort being by Glasgow based public arts project NVA. They appear to be the most likely group to restore the the seminary to something resembling its former glory, having raised £5 million so far for a project promising to turn it into a 'vibrant arts landscape'. However this will never be seen by the designers of the building who have died since it was constructed.","St Peter's Seminary in Argyll was opened in 1964 and became a key training college for Roman Catholic priests .

"Created: . 10:52 EST, 27 July 2014 . Talented: Martin Finn, 23, is wowing audiences across the UK with his singing voice . An autistic man whose condition is so severe he has never spoken a full sentence is reducing audiences to tears with his impressive singing voice. Martin Finn, 23, from Atherton near Wigan, in Lancashire, has to be cared for around the clock by his parents John and Norma. Despite not being able to string more than three words together, Martin is pitch-perfect and is now performing in concerts around the UK. One of his favourite tunes to sing is Ronan Keating's When You Say Nothing At All. Martin's father John, 64, a retired builder, told Sheron Boyle of theSunday People: 'The gap between his disability and his ability makes him one in a million but that is how we have always seen him. 'He can do nothing himself and will always be a toddler trapped in man's body. 'But music is his life and it has given him life.' Mr Finn was diagnosed when he was three years old and went to a special needs school until the age of 14. He then was transferred to Landgate School, in Wigan, which is for children with special needs. It was there that his talent for singing was first spotted. According to his father, Martin listens to a lyric about five or six times before he can sing it back in tune. He has even begun reading books on music despite never being able to read at school. Martin's parents have bought him more than 1,000 CDs, DVDs and videos and he has sung in front of audiences of up to 1,000 people. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Emotional: Martin took part in BBC3's Autistic Superstars which showcased his incredible voice . Before a concert, his mother Norma writes down the songs that he should sing and then reads him the list. They can only give him a couple of minutes' notice before a performance because otherwise he becomes agitated. But a huge crowd did not put Martin off performing on BBC3's Autistic Superstars in 2010 where he sang Sweet Disposition by The Temper Trap. His parents believe Martin is autistic savant - a person with a mental disabiity but has an exceptional skill. The movie Rain Man exposed millions of people to autism as well as the autistic savant phenomenon. In the movie, Raymond, portrayed by Dustin Hoffman, displayed a great memory for baseball statistics, memorised parts of the telephone book, and counted cards in Las Vegas. Martin's parents are now hoping someone in the music industry can help him make a CD and DVD which could help to raise funds to care for the singer after they have gone.","Martin Finn, 23, is from Atherton near Wigan, in Lancashire .

"The largest warship ever built in the UK has been successfully floated on the water for the first time. The 65,000-tonne Royal Navy aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth was floated out of the docks at Rosyth shipyard, where she was assembled, into the waters of the Forth of Firth in Scotland. The carrier was formally named by the Queen earlier this month in a ceremony at the Rosyth Dockyard in Fife, where she was assembled and fitted out. Scroll down for video . Afloat for the first time: The HMS Queen Elizabeth was put out on the waters for the first time today, two weeks after it was named by the Queen . Proud... and expensive: The ship is the largest craft that the Navy has ever constructed, and won't be fully operational until the end of the decade . Floating: The ship was steered out of the docks in a three-hour operation and berthed at a nearby jetty - the first time it has travelled afloat since its assembly . In an operation that started earlier this week, the dry dock was flooded for the first time to allow the vessel to float. It was then manoeuvred out of the dock in a three-hour operation this morning, and berthed at a nearby jetty. Teams will now continue to fit out the ship and prepare the vessel for sea trials in 2016, and it will be fully operational by 2020. However, there are continuing doubts over the military's ability to fill out the plane with its full contingent of F-35 Lightning fighter jets. The Queen Elizabeth is equipped to carry 36 of the planes, but so far only three of the 48 ordered from the U.S. manufacturers have arrived. For the naming ceremony a fortnight ago a dummy version made from aluminium and fibreglass was displayed on top of the craft because no real ones were available to make the journey. The Government has ordered 48 of the planes in total, and plans to buy more, but it is unclear when the deliveries will finally be made. One day: This computer-generated image shows how the specially-modified Lightning jets will one day take off and land from the carrier - but for now the jets are suffering setbacks . Ritual: Two weeks ago the Queen attended a naming ceremony at the Rosyth docks near Fife, where she christened the ship with a bottle of whisky . Procession: Dignitaries and military commanders attended the launch, which was punctuated by a flyover the the Red Arrows . The model also suffered a setback this month when U.S. authorities grounded the model after an engine fire. Part of the engine tore through the top of the plane and set alight during an aborted landing at a Florida airbase, causing the whole fleet to be grounded. The ship and a second vessel, the under-construction HMS Prince of Wales, are the largest warships ever built for the Royal Navy. Together they are known as Queen Elizabeth Class aircraft carriers and are being built by the Aircraft Carrier Alliance (ACA), a partnership of BAE Systems, Babcock, Thales and the Ministry of Defence. The vacated dock will be used for the final assembly of HMS Prince of Wales, which will begin in September. Those behind the project, which costs an estimated £6.2 billion overall, say the QE Class will be the centrepiece of Britain's naval capability. Each 65,000-tonne aircraft carrier will provide the armed forces with a four-acre military operating base, which can be deployed worldwide, operating the F-35 Lightning II and a number of types of helicopter. They will be versatile enough to be used across the full spectrum of military activity, from war fighting to providing humanitarian aid and disaster relief. At 72,000 tons and 932 feet long, the HMS Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier is taller than Nelson’s Column and considerably wider than the M25 at its widest point. She generates enough energy to power Swindon, she can produce 500 tons of fresh water a day - and travel 500 miles a day, too. Above all, she will be able to deliver 36 F-35 Lightning strike fighters and 1,000 troops from the largest piece of British sovereign territory afloat. Her sister ship, the Prince of Wales, is already in production, though it has still not been decided whether she will be operational, mothballed or sold. Each ship, which has a life expectancy of around 50 years, will be fitted out with more than three million metres of cable and it will have enough power to light up a small town. This week, the Defence Secretary, Philip Hammond, described the project as a feat of engineering to match the London Olympics. You could say much the same about the price - more than £6 billion for the pair. And that does not include the planes. Each 65,000-tonne aircraft carrier will provide the armed forces with a four-acre military operating base, which can be deployed worldwide, operating the F-35 Lightning II and a number of types of helicopter. At full capacity, the carrier will be able to launch an aircraft every 30 seconds. They will be versatile enough to be used across the full spectrum of military activity, from war fighting to providing humanitarian aid and disaster relief. HMS Queen Elizabeth will have 679 permanent crew and capacity for 1,600 crew members when fully operational. The ship features a new style of 'twin island' command points - one at the front for steering and one at the back for aircraft direction. Thanks to the cutting-edge technology on board, commanders on the bridge will be able to see 250 miles away. The carrier's range is said to be 10,000 nautical miles and the ship is fitted with a long range 3D radar that is capable of tracking more than 1,000 targets at once or spotting a tennis ball travelling at 2,000 miles per hour.","HMS Queen Elizabeth was floated out of the Rosyth Docks into the Forth of Firth for the first time today .

"These eerie pictures show the demise of an abandoned Grade II listed home, once lovingly cared for by a local historian. Situated in the leafy, affluent suburb of Moseley, Birmingham it was once a stunning example of a quintessentially English detached house. It has now been repossessed after its current owners were declared bankrupt, after they left it to decay for at least eight years. Scroll down for video . The front of the Grade II listed home, in Moseley, Birmingham, which has been left abandoned for eight years after its owners went bankrupt . The view from the back of the abandoned property shows the lawn growing out of control and trees and vines climbing up the side of the house . The gardens in the Birmingham property remain overgrown and don't appear to have been maintained at all during the eight years the home has been deserted . The loft inside the home was left almost completely bare. A local history group is growing 'increasingly concerned' about the state of the abandoned property . The fireplace inside the historic stately English home, which was first built in 1916 and once lovingly cared for by a local historian . Couches and mould-covered walls have been left to rot. The building has now been repossessed and remains unsecured after its owners left it about eight years ago . The house tells the story of the changes in English society that have been felt particularly in the West Midlands. The exterior of the house still looks much the same as when it was completed for Albert Gosling, a butcher, in 1916. It maintains features such as the cupola on top of the garage, which allowed exhaust fumes to escape. Inside, many of the original wooden panels and stained glass windows remain. The kitchen has a distinct 1970s kitsch feel, whilst the living room has a picture of Mecca hanging. Fiona Adams, 67, Secretary of the Moseley History Society said: 'It was the home of Fred and Olive Price - the Moseley Local History Group had many meetings there. 'We’ve been increasingly concerned about the state of this charming Arts and Crafts house that Fred lovingly maintained.' Despite the fact the property has been ignored for a number of years, parts of the interior and living room appear to remain in relatively good condition . However, other parts of the home are in need of major repairs. Here the floor of the living room can be seen with holes while a spider has made a room its nest . A court order stuck on the property's window states the home has been repossessed, however the property still remains unsecured . The home is abandoned but little appears to have been done to clean up, with used teacups and cutlery left lying throughout the kitchen . Both the kitchen and one of the sitting rooms need major repairs, with building materials and mould visibly staining the walls . A large Sony television, along with newspapers and photos of Diana remain intact. Much of the house's exterior also remains as it was when it was completed in 1916 . Still in the house were used teacups, a large Sony television, photographs of Lady Diana, newspapers, made beds and family photographs showing Fred Price. Javid Sattar, who was the last owner of the house, is believed to be the President of the World Council of Muslim Youth. A business card stating Mr Sattar's job title and contact details was found in the home. There was also a photograph of Mecca, the Muslim holy site in Saudi Arabia, and a copy of a book issued during the Pakistan National Defence College's 2002 visit to the United Kingdom. A letter from a law firm has been put up in the house notifying Mr Sattar that it is now in their possession. However, the building hasn’t been secured. The house has slipped a long way from it’s former glory giving concern to neighbours who blame the decay for burglaries on their own properties, saying that it has enabled thieves to gain access through the abandoned house’s garden. These photographs show the former owner of the house, Fred Price (right with glasses), hosting a social gathering inside the Grade II listed family home . A copy of the Daily Mail from June 1, 2006, is left lying in the house - giving an indication of just how long the property has been left to decay . A large Sony television, with a thick gathering of dust on it, has been left in the living room. It was once the home of Fred and Olive Price, two local history enthusiasts . The home's dining area remains a mess, with clothes, rubbish, bowls and cutlery left scattered across the floor and dining table . These pictures show Fred Price, who once owned and cared for the historic property, prior to its latest owner abandoning it eight years ago . A photo of Mecca was left hanging on the living room wall inside the property. A business card found at the address states the former owner was the president of the World Council of Muslim Youth . A picture of Lady Diana remains the living room, while on the right is a book commemorating a Pakistan National Defence College visit to the United Kingdom.

"Kevin Mitchell came into the Last Chance Saloon, otherwise known as the O2 Arena, with all guns blazing. By so doing he resurrected himself from the Boot Hill of boxing into a genuine world title contender, once again. The dazzling exhibition of high-class and deeply hurtful fisticuffs with which he reduced Mexico’s Daniel Estrada to pulp inside eight rounds establishes this talented but hitherto wayward Londoner as the mandatory challenger to WBC lightweight champion Jorge Linares. Kevin Mitchell put Daniel Estrada through eight rounds of hell on Saturday night as he proved far more powerful . Mitchell put on a masterclass in the capital as Estrada took all sorts of punishment up to and including the eighth and final round . Mitchell had an easy Saturday night's work against Estrada as he won with an eighth-round stoppage . Mitchell  celebrates his victory over Mexico's Estrada after their the WBC Silver lightweight title fight at O2 Arena . So easy a Saturday night’s work was this for the 30-year-old Mitchell that it was evident the hard work had gone into the preparation for this fight for the WBC silver belt. Mitchell has admitted that he squandered his two previous world title challenges – against Michael Katsidis and Ricky Burns – on booze and junk food. Given this third opportunity to reach for the stars, he cleaned up his act, thanked his new girlfriend for helping him stay on the straight and narrow and has now proved that he is living the Spartan life of a top ring professional. Just in time, it really does seem all that talent is no to be ultimately wasted. There is talk of Linares being allowed a voluntary defence in April. But the defining day of Mitchell’s career should come this summer. The cavernous O2 Arena was reasonably well populated for a non-world title night and Mitchell came in to roaring London support. Estrada was accompanied to the ring by his better known countryman Juan Manuel Marquez but the Mexican legend, in attendance more for moral and inspirational support rather than active involvement took a seat a couple of rows back from the corner. Mitchell was much the more aggressive from the first bell and despite his opponent’s extra height and long reach he connected on a surprisingly hesitant Mexican with quick sharp lefts to head and body. The  02 Arena was reasonably well populated for a non-world title night as Mitchell (right) punished Estrada . Mitchell was much the more aggressive from the first bell at the O2 Arena in London as he breezed beyond Estrada . Having sworn that he is now dedicated to boxing, Mitchell was not only keener but quicker. Although Estrada did begin to find the range with his range left jab, he walked onto the crisp right hand which put him down early in the second. Mitchell poured on the punishment in the third. Yet despite taking a whole variety of spiteful blows the ponderous Mexican somehow staggered and reeled through to the bell – and through more rounds of pure hell. That gave Mitchell the chance to impress with lightning combinations coupled with clever innovation as he weaved into close quarters. By the midway point at the end of the sixth round Estrada was already in need of knock-out. But Mitchell was the only man looking likely to end the evening inside the 02’s requested curfew of an 11.30 pm finish. So slow was Estrada that he rarely landed a punch. The end looked nigh as Mitchell landed at will in the seventh but again the bell prolonged the beating. But only for another minute and 12 seconds. Ian-John Lewis could have stopped it considerably sooner, should have called a halt as Mitchell came out bombing at the start of the eights, finally came to the gallant Estrada’s rescue as another onslaught climaxed in a left hook which left him tottering and defenceless. Estrada barely landed a punch as he lost against a determined-looking Mitchell on Saturday night .

"The number of requests to hold illegal immigrants in jail ahead of deportation has dramatically reduced over the past two years, a new report claims. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) requests for 'detainers' - which are used to hold someone in prison while it organizes deportation proceedings - have dropped by 9,000 requests per month since 2012. The Syracuse University report has been released just as President Barack Obama plans changes to the immigration system that would give up to five million migrants the right to remain in the U.S. Scroll down for video . A Border Patrol vehicle monitors the international border with Mexico in Arizona. New data shows requests to hold migrants ahead of deportation have reduced dramatically in the past few years . Released Wednesday, the report showed California and Texas registered the biggest reduction in 'detainer' requests across the financial years of 2012, 2013 and up to March this year. Requests in California declined 55 per cent, and Texas 28 per cent. The overall decline of 39 per cent translates to more than 100,000 fewer requests a year across the entire U.S. Meanwhile, House Speaker John Boehner has refused to rule out a government shutdown as a means to block President Barack Obama from halting deportations for millions of illegal immigrants. 'All options are on the table,' Boehner said during a press conference yesterday, noting that Republicans in the House were still discussing their next move. He said: 'Our goal here is to stop the president from violating his own oath of office and violating the Constitution. It's not to shut down the government.' As Boehner walked away, a reporter tried to get him to state on the record that he would not allow a government shut down, but the GOP leader did not respond. Yesterday Fox News reported that Obama would implement a 10-point plan to change the immigration system as early as next Friday, leading to a renewed effort among House Republicans to use an upcoming spending debate to force Obama's hand. Speaker of the House John Boehner refused to rule out a government shutdown, telling reporters that 'all options are on the table' to stop President Barack Obama's immigration reform . President Obama, pictured speaking today during his visit to Myanmar, will reportedly announce his immigration plans as early as next Friday . Fox said that a source close to the White House confirmed that Obama is looking to expand his deferred action program that allows children of illegal immigrants to stay in the U.S. indefinitely to include any one who came to the U.S. as a child. The sweeping order would also allow parents of both citizen children and illegal immigrant children to remain in the U.S. That portion of the directive alone could save as many as 4.5 million immigrants with U.S. born children from being removed from the country, Fox estimated. And the section extending the president's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals could protect another 300,000. Instead of requiring that illegal immigrants applying for residency under the provision be under the age of 31 and provide proof that they arrived  before July of 2007, anyone who came to the country before January 1, 2010, when they were under the age of 16 would be eligible for DACA. A half-million immigrants and their spouses could apply for citizenship through a State Department visa program for high-tech jobs. The president would likely direct ICE to focus on deporting criminals over other illegals, as well. Obama was reportedly briefed on a draft of the plans on his way to Asia. The White House has yet to give its final seal of approval, however, the source told Fox News. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest today told reporters traveling with the president in Asia that Obama still hasn't made up his mind and would not make an announcement on immigration until after he returns to Washington, D.C. this weekend. Moises Herrera, his wife Mirna, and newborn son, David are pictured together last week. They are among the millions of illegal immigrants that could be spared from deportation as a result of Obama's pending actions . While Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has promised there will not be another government shut down, that doesn't mean that anti-amnesty zealots in his caucus, who have said they will use all procedural means available to stop Obama, won't give it another try. Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, who will likely ascend to chairman of the budget committee when Republicans become the majority party next year, has said he wants to use the budget process to bar spending on any immigration reforms ordered up by Obama without the consent of Congress.","Since 2012, requests for 'detainers' have plummeted by 9,000 per month .

"This creepy footage shows a decaying mall overwhelmed by mold and rampant plantlife - just six months after it closed its doors. It shows the Jamestown Mall in St Louis, Missouri, which closed for good in July 2014 after being declared 'blighted' by local authorities. An unidentified explorer made his way inside the complex, and finds his way through old stores, into the bowels of the building and through decaying sales displays from its heyday. Scroll down for video . Creepy: The Jamestown Mall in St Louis, Missouri, is now overgrown and dark . Close-up: An explorer made his way inside the complex and posted torchlit footage of what he found . Decay Lauder: Product displays from inside one of the mall's stores were surrounded by broken glass . Moldering: This once-purple cinema carpet is now covered in green growths . And while much of the building seems to be untouched, the man, whose path was lit only by a head torch, found a bed and pillow inside, suggesting at least on person has made the mall their home. While the last stores in the complex stayed open into last year, according to Fox 2 St Louis, by that time many had already been closed for years. Many areas visited in the footage seemed to show their age - a movie theater, which had mold growing from the carpets, was displaying posters for movies from the summer of 2008. Other seemingly out-of-place features were a room full of developed film photographs, and stacks of 90s-style cathode ray televisions in a back room. Clues? It is unclear how long all the parts of the mall were closed for - but these cinema posters show movies from 2008 . Old-school: Among the finds inside the store was a stash of 90-style cathode ray television sets . Not quite empty? The explorer even found a mattress and pillow inside the mall - suggesting it hasn't been completely vacated . The footage, uploaded to Youtube in December, passes through shops and corridors, which have received remarkably little vandalism, which usually strikes abandoned places soon after they are closed down. The explorer, who is not identified, warns anybody watching that they could be arrested and charged for trespass in the eerie complex. He also wrote that the power and alarm systems in the mall are still functional - although at least one alarmed door he pushed in the course of the video did not appear to respond. The unknown posters appears to be part of the urban exploration community - explorers who often dodge authorities to investigate abandoned places, and show off their footage and photographs online.

"Designed by acclaimed Iraqi-British architect Zaha Hadid and inspired by Siem Reap's Angkor Wat Temple, the new Sleuk Rith Institute in Phnom Penh aims to honour the scars of Cambodia's past while educating and promoting reconciliation to the next generation. Construction of the unique five wooden structures, ranging from three to eight storeys, will begin next year on the site of a former Khmer Rouge re-education centre, and they will house the Documentation Centre of Cambodia, along with a graduate school, auditorium and museum with changing works. Human rights activist Youk Chhang, executive director of the Documentation Centre which was founded with Yale University, provided  a brief that included the explicit request that the building veer away from the stereotypes usually associated with genocide memorials. The new Sleuk Rith Institute in Phnom Penh, designed by acclaimed Iraqi-British architect Zaha Hadid, has been granted building approval . 'Cambodia will never escape its history, but it does not need to be enslaved by it,' he says. 'Post-conflict societies have to move on. 'Memorial architecture has tended to reflect the evil and misfortune of the historical period it represents [but] in this sense the architecture's legacy is dark, sombre, and firmly oriented in the past.' Nearly two million people - 21 per cent of the country's population - died at the hands of the Communist Khmer Rouge regime led by Pol Pot between 1975 and 1979. Rather than just a museum, the Sleuk Rith Institute incorporates the library for Southeast Asia's biggest collection of genocide-related material, a graduate school focusing on genocide, human rights and conflict studies, a research centre and archives, and a media centre and auditorium to be used by the entire community. The plans, which have received final approval from the government, also include a 730,000-square foot memorial park with sports fields, orchards and vegetable gardens, and forest with traditional sculptures, all to be used by the wider community. The five wooden buildings in the complex will be separate at the ground level but will intertwine as they rise, becoming one cohesive unit . 'We were keen to create a forward-looking institution that deviates from the distress-invoking, quasi-industrial harshness of most existing genocide memorial models,' Chhang said. 'This is not to criticise or denigrate such models but, instead, to emphasise that in light of Cambodia's rich cultural and religious traditions, we must move in a different and more positively-oriented direction.' 'The best memorials are not objects we visit once, contemplate, and file away. The best memorials evoke reflection and commemoration, but are also living, dynamic public places that engage with all generations within the community.' The memorial will include the Documentation Centre of Cambodia, along with a graduate school, auditorium and museum . The structures themselves will be separate at ground level but will intertwine as they rise upwards, inspired by the connecting levels of the Angkor Wat temple in Siem Reap. Sleuk Rith translates as 'The power of the leaves', an homage to the dried leaves used to record history. The existing research institute, which will move into part of the new development, is home to more than one million documents that recount the atrocities of the Khmer Rouge. Chhang himself was a survivor of the horrific period of the Killing Fields after being a prisoner of the Khmer Rouge, who ruled from 1975-79, when he was just 15. The Angkor Wat Temple in Siem Reap, Cambodia, which provided inspiration for the new Sleuk Rith Institute . Hadid, a controversial choice for the soon-to-be iconic project given she's not from the region, said she hoped that the institute and its memorial park would transform the community. She said: 'Our hope is that the Sleuk Rith Institute and its memorial park can have a truly transformative effect, bringing new life and a bright future to a site that holds traces of the great tragedies of the past ... An inviting place where reflection, interaction and connectivity are not only its spatial expression, but also embedded within its covenant to the people of Cambodia.'","Sleuk Rith Institute in Phnom Penh to include five buildings that are separate at ground level but intertwine upwards .

This means that if your friend has the app, they could see the keys you press, including corrections and everything you choose not to send. Scroll down for video . The free Android app (pictured) shows users what their friends are typing in real time. The words, and any corrections, appear in the message window before they are sent, meaning users can interject mid-conversation, or plan a reply. An iOS app is 'coming soon' The Californian firm behind the free Android app claim it is ‘a first of its kind true real-time communications app’ that more closely mimics the way people to chat in person. For example, it lets people interject or comment in real-time, without having to wait for the other person to hit send. And, if the recipient already knows a story that the sender is typing, they can tell them so they don’t waste time finishing the text. Elsewhere, the app also means people can have conversations without ever hitting send, making them secure because no data is ever transferred and stored on a network. On the web, sites can determine that a post is being typed by tracking code in the HTML form element of the post. This form element is made up of HTML code that controls the boxes  users type in to. Each time characters are entered into one of these boxes, the app can track the changes in the HTML code. Facebook uses this technology, for example, but the social network has stressed it can’t see the exact keys pressed, and it doesn’t monitor keystrokes. This means the code doesn’t reveal what is being typed. However, Facebook can track when characters and words are typed, how many are typed, and if the typed characters are deleted or abandoned.

Beam's boss Alec Gordon told MailOnline the app does not monitor any messages that are being sent by the users. Only messages that ever go up in database are those that cannot be currently delivered, thus waiting for the client device to reconnect, and then it's delivered and wiped.

"David Beckham was involved in a car accident this morning after picking up his son Brooklyn from Arsenal’s training ground. Beckham, 39, had been at the training centre at London Colney, Hertfordshire, watching his eldest son Brooklyn, 15, play for the club’s under-16 side against Brighton. Although the former England captain and his son walked away from the accident unhurt, Beckham's original car was unable to be used. Scroll down for video .

Former England international David Beckham and sons Brooklyn  (left), Cruz  (centre) and Romeo (right) Arsenal staff ushered onlookers away from the scene and Beckham was driven away in another car. Both were said to be shaken following the accident. One Brighton youngster, Archie Davies, tweeted: ‘Just seen David Beckham looks like he got in a car crash and hurt his shoulder.’ The teenager then added: ‘Star struck by seeing David Beckham tbh.’ And team-mate Thomas Cadman thought the whole episode was utterly surreal, tweeting: ‘Weird to play against Brooklyn Beckham earlier. Even weirder to be currently stuck behind David Beckham as he has crashed his car.' Sources told The Telegraph the accident was 'quite a heavy prang but thankfully everyone walked away uninjured' and that the other car involved had been travelling at 'quite a speed'. Beckham had been driving an Audi RS6 which was left damaged on the driver's side in the accident. However, its airbags had deployed, the paper reported. Brighton footballer Archie Davies tweeted that it appeared as though Beckham was injured. He later tweeted he was 'star struck' at seeing the former England international . Thomas Cadman, another Brighton player, was stuck behind the Beckhams when the accident occurred .

He was allegedly in his black Range Rover Sport with what looked like his son Brooklyn, then aged 14, in the front passenger seat when the collision occurred on the afternoon of October 25. Police were seen leaving his home, then interviewing witnesses nearby for more information about the accident.

"The families of many police officers in Ferguson, Missouri, are in hiding or running from town amid death and assault threats. One police wife told KTVI that she's received threats over the phone and she's been paranoid for her and her young daughter's safety ever since. 'Did they follow me here?' she told the station.

Our streets!' and 'Killer cops have got to go!' Officers in helmets and shields were deployed after a commander told protesters not to block traffic. Brief scuffles broke out and at least one woman and a man were handcuffed and taken away. Police did not confirm an official tally. The Chicago Tribune reported at least six were arrested. The August 9 killing of Brown triggered weeks of sometimes violent protests demanding Wilson be indicted. Tensions continued on Thursday and required police in riot gear to keep the peace (pictured) Demonstrators face police officers as they stand outside the Ferguson police station . Wilson's camp has said he feels 'confident' he won't be charged by the grand jury and is working with city officials to negotiate his resignation from the Ferguson Police Department. Jeff Roorda, business manager for the St. Louis Police Officers' Association, said he met Thursday with Ferguson officer Darren Wilson, who has remained secluded from the public eye since the shooting. 'It's fair to say that neither he nor his defense team expect an indictment,' Roorda said. Meanwhile, Wilson may announce as early as Friday his plans to resign from the force, as a way of protecting fellow officers and easing pressures in the wake of the shooting. Making a plea: Michael Brown Sr. (left) has urged protesters remain calm and be non-violent as Ferguson prepares for a grand jury decision in the death of his son . The victim's father, Michael Brown Sr., has released a public service announcement appealing for calm and non-violence among those who might protest, saying that 'hurting others is not the answer.' He also takes a moment to thank many of the protesters for 'lifting [their] voices to end racial profiling and police intimidation.' 'No matter what the grand jury decides, I do not want my son’s death to be in vain,' Brown said. 'I want it to lead to incredible change, positive change, change that makes the St. Louis region better for everyone.","Spouses and children of cops in Ferguson, Missouri, have received assault and death threats after the shooting of Michael Brown .

"In a potentially devastating blow for Roger Goodell, a law enforcement official claims he sent a video of Ray Rice punching his then-fiancee to an NFL executive five months ago - completely contradicting the commissioners claim that no one at the NFL had seen it before Monday. The person played The Associated Press a 12-second voicemail received from from an NFL office number on April 9 confirming the video arrived. A female voice expresses thanks for the video and says: 'You're right. It's terrible.' And in a sign the NFL is descending into full damage limitation mode, Goodell announced former FBI director Robert S. Mueller III will conduct a probe into how the league pursued and handled evidence as it investigated claims against Rice. Scroll Down for Video (Warning Graphic Content) Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice punches his fiancee, Janay Palmer, in an elevator at the Revel casino in Atlantic City, N.J.  A law enforcement official says he sent a video of Ray Rice punching his then-fiancee to an NFL executive three months ago, while league officers have insisted they didn't see the violent images until this week . NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said in a statement that the investigation will be overseen by owners John Mara of the New York Giants and Art Rooney of the Pittsburgh Steelers. Goodell said that Mueller will have access to all NFL records and will have full cooperation from league personnel. The law enforcement official, speaking to the AP on condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigation, says he had no further communication with any NFL employee and can't confirm anyone watched the video. The person said he was unauthorized to release the video but shared it unsolicited, because he wanted the NFL to have it before deciding on Rice's punishment. The NFL has repeatedly said it asked for but could not obtain the video of the Baltimore Ravens running back hitting Janay Palmer - who is now his wife - at an Atlantic City casino in February. The league says it has no record of the video, and no one in the league office had seen it until it was released by TMZ Monday. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell pauses during a new conference in Atlanta. A law enforcement official says he sent a video of Ray Rice punching his then-fiancee to an NFL employee three months ago . Smiles: Ray Rice receives flowers at his home in Baltimore. The disgraced NFL star accepted a large bouquet on his front doorstep on Tuesday evening along with his wife, Janay. When asked about the voicemail Wednesday, NFL officials repeated their assertion that no league official had seen the video before Monday. Investigation: Former FBI Director Robert Mueller has been appointed by the NFL to investigate their response to the Ray Rice affair . 'We have no knowledge of this,' NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said Wednesday. 'We are not aware of anyone in our office who possessed or saw the video before it was made public on Monday. We will look into it.' Despite the huge financial and legal resources at the NFL's disposal, Goodell has repeatedly said the first time he saw the video was on Monday morning and has tried to shift the blame to law enforcement, claiming they denied him access to the footage. Goodell, who was supposed to attend an award ceremony for Panthers owner Jerry Richardson in Charlotte Wednesday night, did not attend the event and instead changed his plans and headed back to New York. The law enforcement official said he sent a DVD copy of the security camera video to an NFL office and included his contact information. He asked the AP not to release the name of the NFL executive for fear that the information would identify the law enforcement official as the source. Goodell initially suspended Rice for two games following the February incident, but the Ravens released Rice on Monday and the NFL suspended him indefinitely after TMZ released the video. Goodell told CBS on Tuesday that 'no one in the NFL, to my knowledge' had seen a new video of what happened on the elevator until it was posted online. 'We assumed that there was a video. We asked for video. But we were never granted that opportunity,' Goodell said. Ray Rice holds hands with his wife, Janay Palmer, as they arrive at Atlantic County Criminal Courthouse in Mays Landing in May . In a memo to the NFL's 32 teams on Wednesday, Goodell said that the league asked law enforcement for the video, but not the casino. 'In the context of a criminal investigation, information obtained outside of law enforcement that has not been tested by prosecutors or by the court system is not necessarily a reliable basis for imposing league discipline,' he wrote. A video shown to the AP on Monday is slightly longer than the TMZ version, and includes some audio. Rice and Janay Palmer - now Janay Rice - can be heard shouting obscenities at each other, and she appears to spit at Rice right before he throws a brutal punch. After she collapses, he drags her out of the elevator and is met by some hotel staff. One of them can be heard saying, 'She's drunk, right?' And then, 'No cops.' Rice had been charged with felony aggravated assault in the case, but in May he was accepted into a pretrial intervention program that allowed him to avoid jail time and could lead to the charge being purged from his record. A prominent New Jersey lawmaker has called for that decision to be reviewed. Hours after portions of the video were made public by TMZ, Goodell suspended Rice indefinitely and Baltimore terminated his contract. He had originally been suspended for two games, and team officials had praised him for his apologies and actions after his arrest for aggravated assault. Goodell and team officials said they were taking more severe action because of the violence in the video. Pressure mounted from outside the NFL even before the law enforcement official's account was published. Twelve Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee sent Goodell a letter calling for greater transparency from the NFL, and Republican Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada said Goodell had not acted swiftly enough to punish Rice. 'By waiting to act until (the video) was made public you effectively condoned the action of the perpetrator himself,' Heller wrote in a letter to Goodell. 'I cannot and will not tolerate that position by anybody, let alone the National Football League.' Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said after the law enforcement official's account that the news suggested a 'burgeoning, insurmountable credibility gap' in Goodell's statements. 'If these reports are true, Commissioner Goodell must go, for the good of the NFL and its fans,' Blumenthal said in a statement.","Law enforcement official claims they sent NFL copy of Rice elevator video .

"Radio DJ Sara Cox shortly after giving birth to her daughter Lola, right, now 9, who she refuses to let watch Come Dine With Me as it's too raunchy . Former Radio 1 ladette Sara Cox has blasted modern media for being too crude, branding Channel 4 programme Come Dine With Me 'raunchy' and rap music 'sexist.' The 39-year-old mother of three, known for her days of hard partying in the 1990s has criticised US rapper Pitbull saying his sexist lyrics 'make her soul weep.' She said: 'Someone like [rapper] Pitbull on Radio 1 . makes my soul weep with the way he sings about women - I just couldn't . bear playing that.' She then turned on Radio 1 for playing tracks that feature 'sexist' lyrics which are rife in hip hop music and modern pop music. Pitbull, whose real name is Armando Perez burst onto the music scene in . 2009 with the hit song 'I Know You Want Me (Calle Ocho)' from his . fourth album Rebelution. He has sold over five million albums, with . number one hits in more than 15 countries. The artist has had an extraordinary amount of commercial success but often comes under fire for his depiction of women in his videos and  songs. The Latin artist's lyrics and videos often ooze with references to scantily clad women and sex. His . lyrics in his song 'Timber', which reached number one last year, . include: 'I have ‘em like Miley Cyrus, clothes off/twerking in their . bras and thongs… face down, booty up.' Her criticism of Pitbull comes on the . heels of growing concern over the explicit sexual content in pop music and the use of half-naked women in videos . like Robin Thicke's hit Blurred lines. However a BBC spokesman told Mail Online: 'Each track is considered for the playlist based on its musical merit and whether it is right for our young audience, with decisions made on a case-by-case basis.’ He added that there are currently no Pitbull songs on the Radio 1 playlist. Back in the day: Sara Cox pictured when she was a TV presenter on Channel 4 show 'Born Sloppy' The ultimate ladette 'Sara Cox' was born in Bolton, Greater Manchester. The lively outspoken broadcaster has never steered away from controversy and once said live on air in 2000 that the Queen Mother 'smelt of wee'. She is probably best known for presenting the Radio 1 Breakfast Show between 2000 and 2003. She now hosts 'Sounds of the 80s' on BBC Radio 2. However, she was also well known for presenting Top of the Pops, The Girlie Show on Channel 4,  Born Sloppy and The Big Breakfast, following in the footsteps of her friend Zoë Ball. She was known as being a poster child for the  1990s ladette culture along with Ball. Cox transferred to radio in 1999 when she joined Radio 1. In 2001, she married DJ Jon Carter; they split in December 2005. Last year, Cox tweeted a picture to announce she had just been married to long-term boyfriend, Ben Cyzer. She has three children. In the early 1990s Cox, was a presenter on Channel 4's edgy . The Girlie Show and was frequently pictured out clubbing . with a glass of drink in her hand. Bolton-born Cox, now based in Willesden, north London, previously faced criticism for her involvement in ladette culture. But her life is very different today. She admits in an interview with the Radio Times: 'I used to watch Come Dine With Me with my daughter, Lola, who's nine. But . she says she can't anymore because they've always got 'strippers on' or . someone with their cleavage out, adding 'it's a shame because it used . to have a real innocence to it.' Cox made her name on her brash and sometimes offensive . behaviour. She controversially said that the Queen Mother 'smelt of wee' on air but said she had settled down by the time she began to host the . Radio 1 breakfast show during the late nineties. However, despite her party girl image, she explained that she never used to pretend that she was 'the youth' when she was at Radio 1. 'People knew that I'd gone to bed at 9.30 the night before, having prepared a casserole,' she said. The retired wild child also admitted that she still dreamt of acting and wanted to write. She . added: 'I wouldn't mind if Martin Freeman was to demand me in his next . project, but actually I need to get round to some writing. When you're . doing the school run and walking the dog it's pretty tricky to find time . to become a world famous writer and Oscar-winning actress.' Pitbull, whose real name is Armando Perez, is an American rapper and Latin Grammy winning artist from Miami, Florida. He has released seven albums and one EP. He burst onto the music scene in 2009 with the hit song 'I Know You Want Me (Calle Ocho)” from his fourth album Rebelution. The artist has sold well over five million albums, with number one hits in more than 15 countries. But his songs, as well as the accompanying music videos, often prompt controversy. Pitbull’s song 'Timber', which reached number one last year, includes the lyrics: 'I have ‘em like Miley Cyrus, clothes off/twerking in their bras and thongs… face down, booty up.' He also sings: 'She say she won’t, but I bet she will.' Other songs include the lines 'I like that when you fight back' and 'Shake that s*** b****/And be off in the club with a hard-a** d***.'In his song Give Me Everything, he raps 'Tonight I want all of you tonight, Give me everything tonight. For all we know we might not get tomorrow Let's do it tonight.' His video for the song 'I’m a Freak 'with Enrique Iglesias has also been criticised for its objectification of women. The popular rapper can often be seen hitting the stage with fellow Latin artist Jennifer Lopez.","Cox, was a presenter on Channel 4's edgy .

"The mother of conjoined twins born with one body and two heads has described how her 11-day old daughters are already showing 'very separate' personalities. 'You have to see it to believe it,' Renee Young told Woman's Day, 'sometimes Faith will cry and wake Hope up, who then looks sideways as if to say, ""Thanks for that"". 'We are blessed we've got this far. I just find them adorable.' The girls' father, Simon Howie, said he was amazed at the progress the girls have made in hospital since their birth on May 8. 'Each time I come means they've reached another milestone and pulled through another day,' he said. The babies, Faith and Hope, were christened at Westmead Children's Hospital after their miraculous birth on May 8. 'I think they're beautiful and Simon thinks they're beautiful, so really, that's all that matters,' Ms Young told A Current Affair. Scroll down for video . Two girls in one body: Renee Young with her daughters Faith and Hope who were born in a Sydney hospital on May 8 . Faith and Hope were born with a rare condition called diprosopus, which means they share the same body and organs but have separate brains and two faces . Proud mother: Faith and Hope are now in a stable condition and breathing without support, after initial doubts . They continue to defy medical odds and Ms Young and Mr Howie have maintained a bedside vigil for their daughters who were born with identical faces and two brains. Despite doctors initially telling the couple to terminate the pregnancy, they have been told the girls have a strong chance if they survive the next five weeks. The girls were born with a rare condition called diprosopus, which means they share the same body and vital organs but have their own faces and brains which are connected by only one brain stem. 'Even though there is only one body, we call them our twins. To us, they are our girls and we love them,' Mr Howie told Woman's Day. 'We have no idea how long they will be in hospital. We just want to bring them home, happy and healthy to make our family a little bit bigger and a bit more chaotic.' Hope and Faith's have their own brains which are connected by only one brain stem . 'I think they're beautiful and Simon thinks they're beautiful so really that's all that matters,' their mother said. As the parents of seven other children, Renee and her husband Simon Howie never considered terminating while the girls grew healthy . The condition is so rare that only 35 cases have ever been recorded and none have survived. Due to the complex nature of Faith and Hope's condition, doctors are unsure about what to expect and they are being forced to make their prognoses day by day. Mr Howie confirmed that specialists were called in to decipher a range of problems and assess the twins in great depth, from the functioning of their lungs and blood vessels to decisions about how best to proceed with feeding. But despite all the forewarned medial problems likely to come their way, Ms Young and Mr Howie are happy their girls are alive and well. 'I think they're beautiful and Simon thinks they're beautiful so really that's all that matters,' Ms Young told A Current Affair. Mr Howie said: 'I sort of don't believe in terminating the baby if it's healthy and growing fine and everything is going to plan' Their mother Renee gave birth to the girls via an emergency caesarean . Their condition is so rare that only 35 cases have ever been recorded and none have survived . From as early as 28 weeks into Ms Young’s pregnancy, specialists were concerned about grave developmental issues. One of the biggest predicted survival risks from their doctor Greg Kesby was that the babies would be unable to breathe on their own. The couple, who are parents to seven other children, were also told early on in the pregnancy not to keep the child ‘because it would be looked upon by the public as a freak’. They defied the doctors because Ms Young had never terminated a pregnancy and because they had a family 'that gives us a lot of support'. At first, things looked to be taking a turn for the worst as Ms Young unexpectedly went into labour at only 32 weeks on May 8, and was forced to have an emergency caesarean. The couple refused to terminate their unborn twins despite being warned by doctors of the medical and social problems the girls were likely to suffer . Channel 9 were given the honour of choosing the middle names of the newborns, picking Daisy for Faith and Alice for Hope . The twin girls were not breathing in the first few moments after their birth, leaving their parents in a state of great anxiety . The girls have defied all odds and are currently in a stable condition and breathing without any assistance. Although the couple were aware from the early stages of pregnancy that their children would have great developmental problems, they said that while they continued to grow healthily, they couldn’t come to terms with letting their unborn twins go. 'We sort of looked at it as; it'd be the same as being a child with autism or Down syndrome. I sort of don't believe in terminating the baby if it's healthy and growing fine and everything is going to plan,' Mr Howie said. The proud parents of the small survivors have braced themselves for a difficult path ahead and refuse to say goodbye prematurely. 'I would say, if I only get two days with the baby, I only get two days with the baby - at least I have some time with it,' Ms Young said.

"Christie Brinkley's ex-husband Peter Cook has lashed out at the supermodel this week in an explosive court document countering claims he owes her child support. The 58-year-old former Sports Illustrated cover girl quietly filed a motion to resolve claims Mr Cook owes $32,000 in expenses for their two children, including school tuition and summer camp fees. But Mr Cook reignited their bitter custody dispute, claiming in a 91-page document at Suffolk County Supreme Court in New York that she in fact owes him money - calling her a 'narcissistic egomaniac'. Happier times: Christie Brinkley and Peter Cook, pictured together in 2006, reached a divorce settlement in 2008 after months of very public court disputes . Glamorous: Model Christie Brinkley pictured at a fashion show last month in New York .

'is jealous of my success'. Neither party has yet commented. Ms . Brinkley met Mr Cook in 1998 and had her third child, Sailor, with him. Mr Cook legally adopted her son with ex-husband Richard Taubman, Jack. She also has a daughter, Alexa Ray, . with first husband, singer Billy Joel. Ms Brinkley appeared in the video for his 1983 hit Uptown Girl but their marriage only lasted for nine years.

"A series of images have emerged which show the destruction of almost a dozen ancient shrines and Shia mosques in Isis-controlled territory in western Iraq. The photographs, which show the destruction in Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, and the town of Tal Afar, were posted on a website which frequently carries official statements from the Islamic State extremist group. Some of the photos show bulldozers plowing through walls, while others show buildings being demolished by explosives in a cloud of smoke and rubble. Scroll down for video . Wave of terror: Images emerged yesterday showing almost a dozen ancient shrines and Shia mosques being destroyed in the Iraqi city of Mosul. Sir Richard said the conflict is largely 'Muslim on Muslim' The images were posted on a website which carries official statements from the Islamic State extremist group . Some of the photos show buildings being demolished by explosives in a cloud of smoke and rubble. Pictured is the Shia Saad bin Aqeel Husseiniya shrine in Tal Afar, Iraq . A Twitter feed attributed to Isis, which reportedly carried the images, described the buildings as pagan 'temples' Residents from both Mosul and Tal Afar confirmed the destruction of the sites, Associated Press has reported. Sunni extremists consider Shia Muslims heretics, and the veneration of saints apostasy. A Twitter feed attributed to Isis, which reportedly carried the images, described the buildings as pagan 'temples', according to The Times. 'We feel very sad for the demolition of these shrines, which we inherited from our fathers and grandfathers,' Ahmed, a 51-year-old Mosul resident, said, the Times of India reported. He added: 'They are landmarks in the city.' Security agencies in Iraq, meanwhile, were yesterday working to verify the authenticity of a video that purportedly shows the leader of Islamic State delivering a sermon at the Great Mosque in Mosul.

A resident in the city was reported as saying, 'We feel very sad for the demolition of these shrines, which we inherited from our fathers and grandfathers' The video said to show Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was reportedly filmed on Friday. It was posted on at least two websites known to be used by the organization and bore the logo of its media arm. The sermon in Mosul would be the first public appearance for al-Baghdadi, a shadowy figure who has emerged as perhaps the preeminent figure in the international jihadi community. Al-Baghdadi, who has a $10 million U.S. bounty on his head, took over the group four years ago and has since transformed it from an al-Qaida affiliate focused on Iraq into an independent transnational force that controls a huge stretch of land straddling the Syria-Iraq border. Among the pictures to have emerged is this image of the Shia Jawad Husseiniya mosque in Tal Afar, Iraq . The mosque is destroyed in a cloud of dust and rubble following an explosion . Probe: Security agencies in Iraq were yesterday working to verify a video of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (pictured), the leader of Islamic State, purportedly delivering a sermon at the Great Mosque in Mosul . Iraqi military spokesman Lt. Gen. Qassim al-Moussawi told reporters on Sunday that the country's security services are still analyzing the 21-minute video to verify whether the speaker is indeed al-Baghdadi, and that the government will 'announce the details once they are available.' The purported appearance in Mosul, a city of some 2 million that the militants seized last month, came five days after al-Baghdadi's group declared the establishment of an Islamic state, or caliphate, in the territories it has seized in Iraq and Syria. The group proclaimed al-Baghdadi the leader of its state and demanded that all Muslims pledge allegiance to him.","Images show at least 10 ancient shrines and Shia mosques being destroyed .

"A disagreement between Republican lawmakers over a proposed strategy to block President Barack Obama's coming immigration mandate took a nasty turn on Thursday as a battle between two powerful factions of the GOP spilled into the press. On one side of the ring are conservative lawmakers, including Rep. Matt Salmon of Arizona and Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, who want to insert language into future spending legislation that bars immigration agencies from using their funding to issue the roughly 5 million new work permits the president is expected to authorize tomorrow. At the other end are moderates, like House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers, who don't want to disrupt the budget process or risk another government shutdown. If Congress does not pass a new bill disbursing federal funds before Dec. 12, the government will undergo a partial shutdown, with other essential services and staff remaining in place until a new resolution is adopted. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Leading the charge: Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, right, who is set to become chairman of the upper chamber's budget committee next Congress, is a key proponent of a conservative strategy to block the president's immigration order through a federal spending bill.  House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers, left, is trying to smack him down . Salmon and 62 other House Republicans sent a letter to Rogers and ranking member on the appropriations committee Nita Lowey last week to urge them to use the upcoming spending legislation 'to prohibit the use of funds by the administration for the implementation of current or future executive actions that would create additional work permits and green cards outside of the scope prescribed by Congress.' Obama's intended actions 'would be in direct violation of U.S. law,' they wrote, and Congress should use its 'power of the purse' to stop him 'from implementing policies that are contrary to our laws and the desire of the American people.' Signed by vocal Tea Partiers such as Thomas Massie of Kentucky, Louie Gohmert of Texas, Tim Huelskamp of Kansas, Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, and Steve King of Iowa, the letter echos a similar strategy proposed by Sessions in the Senate. Sessions, who will likely ascend to chairman of the Senate's budget committee in the next Congress, has argued that tying the Department of Homeland Security's funding to the president's immigration order is the best way to keep the president from following through with his plan. 'Congress appropriates the money,' Sessions told reporters last week. 'That's a clear constitutional power. 'If Congress disapproves of the president providing ID cards for people who've been in the country illegally, then it should not appropriate money to fund it.' Sessions favors the approach outlined by his colleagues in the House. But in the event the Senate's current Democratic leadership turns it down, he prefers a short-term continuing resolution to fully fund the government through early next year. At that point, Republicans who won seats in the midterm elections will have already been sworn in, padding the GOP's numbers in both chambers, and the Senate in particular. Republicans currently hold just 45 seats in the Senate. That number will swell to 53 - potentially 54 depending on the outcome of a Dec. 6 run-off election in Louisiana - making the GOP the majority party. At that point Republicans would only be a few Democratic votes shy of a filibuster-proof coalition that could pass long-term legislation funding every aspect of the government  but those operations sanctioned DHS. Funding for DHS would be contingent on Obama agreeing to counteract his immigration order by signing the spending bill expressly restricting government money from going toward new green cards and work permits. The game plan sets up a scenario in which a shutdown could occur early next year if Senate Democrats refuse to go along with the GOP's scheme or Obama withholds his signature from the legislation. Establishment members of the Republican caucus worry that's exactly what will happen if they go down this path and would like to see immigration untangled from the budget process. While they are in complete agreement that Obama is overstepping his constitutional authority needs to be reigned in, many of them do not believe the spending debate is the proper avenue to air those grievances. A shutdown may not have the intended result and could backfire on the GOP the way it did last year when Congress allowed the government to close for the first half of October. Polling afterward showed that the vast majority of Americans blamed Republicans for the mishap. A conservative Senate aide involved in developing the strategy told MailOnline that if Republicans took the two-prong approach to passing the budget, a shutdown would be highly unlikely. As long as the president signed the overarching legislation that funds every department but DHS, those agencies would stay up and running through the agreed upon date. Only DHS would technically shut down if Obama vetoed the second bill. And in all actuality, the aide said, much of its operations would continue given that many are deemed ‘essential.' That includes the divisions that handle border patrol, as well as customs and enforcement.

Attempting to put the spending fight to bed, Rogers and other legislators on the appropriations committee issued a statement shooting down tea partiers' strategy, claiming that the legislative branch doesn't have the jurisdiction to cut off funding for the government bureaucracy that would be tasked with carrying out the president's executive order. 'The primary agency for implementing the president’s new immigration executive order is the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). This agency is entirely self-funded through the fees it collects on various immigration applications,' a statement sent out by the committee said. 'Congress does not appropriate funds for any of its operations, including the issuance of immigration status or work permits, with the exception of the ‘E-Verify’ program,' it explained. 'Therefore, the appropriations process cannot be used to “defund” the agency. 'The agency has the ability to continue to collect and use fees to continue current operations, and to expand operations as under a new executive order, without needing legislative approval by the Appropriations Committee or the Congress, even under a continuing resolution or a government shutdown.' According to Salmon, Rogers also tried to tell conservatives that if they passed a bill now funding the government, they could always take back the money later if they didn't like how the president was using it. 'Chairman Rogers just got up and said if we pass an omnibus and then the president does this executive amnesty, he said we can rescind it...and we don't need the president,' Salmon told Breitbart News on Tuesday. 'That's what he just told me. I've never heard that before,' he stated. A GOP congressional aide who spoke to MailOnline that 'rescission' is also bogus and is not possible. The aide also said Rogers claim that Congress doesn't have the authority to regulate Citizenship and Immigration Services 'absurd and patently false.' By their logic, the President could do virtually anything it wants if the actions are funded by fees, and Congress would be powerless to stop him,' the aide said. 'There is simply no way that is the case. What’s really going on here is there are some who want their corporate-backed spending bill so badly they’d even resort to making ridiculous claims like this.' This afternoon Sen. Sessions also sent a statement to reporters explaining that House appropriators were off base. 'On its face, the suggestion that the White House can implement any unlawful and unconstitutional act so long as it pays for it with assessed fees is just plain wrong,' he said. 'The USCIS union president has already warned that the agency lacks the resources to properly screen applicants now—and he stressed just last month that the President’s executive amnesty would make the situation ""exponentially worse—and more dangerous,"" ' Sessions argued. Continuing, he said, 'the American people’s Congress has the power and every right to deny funding for unworthy activities. It is a routine and constitutional application of congressional power. 'There is no question that Congress has the power to block this expenditure and no doubt that it can be done.' The real question here, he said, is 'whether or not Democratic Senators will finally stand up to the President' by passing a resolution that would effectively block his amnesty measures.","Obama is expect to issue roughly 5 million illegal immigrants work permits .

"Hundreds of Palestinians desperate to escape Israel's bombardments in Gaza have been queuing to cross into Egypt.

The Israeli Defense Ministry said it is helping anxious Israelis leave homes close to the war zone in what is effectively the government's first large-scale voluntary evacuation effort in the nearly eight weeks of fighting. Palestinian health officials say 2,119 people, most of them civilians including more than 400 children, have been killed in Gaza since July 8, when Israel launched an offensive with the declared aim of ending rocket fire into its territory. Sixty-four Israeli soldiers and four civilians in Israel have been killed. Smoke and sand are seen following what witnesses said was an Israeli air strike in Gaza on Monday .

Gazans said they had received messages on their phones for several days, with a new recording on Monday ending with the words: 'To Hamas leaders and to the residents of Gaza: The battle is open and you have been warned.' Qais Abu Leila, a senior Palestinian official involved in Egyptian-mediated talks to reach a truce in seven weeks of fighting, said Cairo had proposed an indefinite ceasefire. Cairo's latest initiative calls for the immediate opening of Gaza's crossings with Israel and Egypt to aid reconstruction efforts in the battered coastal strip to be followed by talks on a longer-term easing of the blockade. 'Egyptian efforts are continuing. The ball is in the Israeli court, and they have not responded to this proposal 36 hours after it was referred to them,' Abu Leila told Reuters. Two Palestinians walk between destroyed buildings hit three weeks ago by Israeli military strikes in the northern Gaza Strip city of Beit Hanun . Hamas has said it will not stop fighting until the Israeli-Egyptian blockade on the enclave of 1.8 million people is lifted. Both Israel and Egypt view Hamas as a security threat and are demanding guarantees that weapons will not enter the economically-crippled territory. Israel recalled its negotiators from Cairo on Tuesday after a ceasefire collapsed. In Gaza City on Sunday, an Israeli strike on a car killed Mohammed al-Ghoul, described by the Israeli military as a Hamas official responsible for 'terror fund transactions'. U.S. dollars were found in the wrecked vehicle, witnesses said. Israel later bombed and destroyed Ghoul's house. He was targeted three days after Israel assassinated three top Hamas commanders in the southern Gaza Strip. Israel has said Hamas bears responsibility for civilian casualties because it operates among non-combatants. The group, it said, uses schools and mosques to store weapons and as launching sites for cross-border rocket attacks. Meanwhile, Tehran will 'accelerate' arming Palestinians in retaliation for Israel deploying a spy drone over Iran, which was shot down, a military commander said on Monday.

Iran, which does not recognise the existence of Israel, has confirmed it supplied Palestinian fighters from Hamas and the Islamic Jihad with the technology for the rockets being fired relentlessly into Israel from Gaza since July 8. 'We will accelerate the arming of the West Bank and we reserve the right to give any response,' said General Amir-Ali Hajizadeh, commander of aerial forces of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards, in a statement on their official website sepahnews.com. Last month, Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei urged the Islamic world to arm Palestinians to allow them to counter what he called Israel's 'genocide' in Gaza. He also said Israel was acting like a 'rabid dog' and 'a wild wolf', causing a human catastrophe that must be resisted. Hajizadeh said at a news conference broadcast on television that the unmanned aircraft shot down was a 'Hermes' stealth drone that 'can evade radar'. 'Pieces of the drone have been recovered intact and are being analysed,' he said, adding that it had a range of 800 kilometres (500 miles). 'It was spotted by our surveillance system and shot down by a Revolutionary Guards surface-to-air missile,' Hajizadeh said. According to Hajizadeh, the drone was equipped with two cameras capable of taking high-quality images. Footage of the recovered drone pieces was aired on Iranian television.","Nearly 500,000 Gazans have been displaced as a result of Israel's attacks, which have destroyed thousands of homes .

"Emily Cressey should not even be here. Her tiny, birdlike body should still be safely encased in her mother’s womb, 36 weeks into the gestation process, 18-inches long and gaining the weight she needs to thrive. Instead, she is officially three months old, weighs just 4lb 8oz,  and is alive only thanks to a supermarket sandwich bag that replicated the warmth and safety of her  mother’s body. Weighing little more than 1lb and born 16 weeks before her due date, Emily is one of Britain’s youngest surviving premature babies. Claire Cressey cuddles her daughter Emily who was born 16 week premature. Born that early, babies are deemed 'on the edge of life', and less than half survive . Pictured this week clinging to her mother’s finger, Emily’s battle for life touched the hearts of anyone who saw it. And now The Mail on Sunday can reveal the incredible technique that doctors used to save Emily’s fragile life – and her mother’s own devastating account of watching her daughter struggle to survive. Her fight for life has astounded medics at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh who delivered her. The instant Emily was born, doctors delicately placed her inside a resealable plastic bag, identical to those sold in supermarkets. It was an ingenious measure. ‘The bag acts as a micro environment,’ explains consultant paediatrician Dr Andrew Gallagher. ‘At this age she was too tiny for an incubator, which is designed for full-term babies.’ This week her exhausted but exhilarated parents, Claire Cressey and Alan Coultas, were given the news that on June 16, the day she was due to be born, little Emily will finally be allowed home. Cradling her daughter, Claire, 34, said yesterday: ‘It’s been an emotional journey. Our world has been turned upside-down and what should have been every new parent’s happiest moment became our worst nightmare, delivering our beautiful daughter at 24 weeks.’ Latest UK statistics show that babies born at 24 weeks have between a 42-46 per cent survival rate. They are highly susceptible to losing body heat, so hospitals are putting them into sandwich bags to stave off death from hypothermia. Ms Cressey, a former care assistant who lives in Coldstream in the Scottish Borders, added: ‘Emily’s finally out of the woods. 'It’s such a relief after everything we’ve been through. My little lady is on a roll now and there’s no stopping her.’ Here, in her own words, Claire, who has three older daughters, Caitlin, eight, Millie, four, and Brooke, 17 months, with long-term partner Alan, 47, describes the traumatic moments leading up to Emily’s birth on February 27 and the desperate battle to save her life. To this day, I will never know why I went into labour early, throwing us into a nightmare. Our much-wanted fourth child was supposed to arrive on June 16 but, instead, she had other plans. My waters broke without warning on Sunday, February 23, sending me into a state of panic. I was aware that babies born before 24 weeks, and so still within the legal abortion stage, are labelled on the ‘edge of life’, as their lungs and other vital organs are not developed enough. As a result, not all hospitals are keen to intervene. I remember counting in fear, wondering what would happen if the baby was born that day. I now understand the despair that some parents must go through when their baby is born at 23 weeks or earlier and is allowed to die. It was with relief I counted she was exactly 24 weeks that day and at least my baby would be given a fighting chance, whatever was about to happen. A day earlier, and it might have been different. In the end, it would be another four days before Emily arrived on Thursday, February 27 – the day before my birthday. I’d been given a series of steroid injections on the day my waters broke, in an attempt to help accelerate the baby’s lung development. But with no sign of contractions starting, I was allowed to return home to rest. It was a horrible waiting game, but when my contractions finally came, everything happened terrifyingly quickly. We’d known that Emily was in the breech position, and by the time we reached the hospital 50 miles away one of her feet was sticking out. Incredibly, they delivered Emily one-and-a-half minutes after we arrived in the labour suite. To all intents and purposes, it was a ‘normal’ birth, except my baby was coming far too early. But there she was, my little Emily Grace, weighing just 1lb 3oz, and our lives would never be the  same again. 'She was put into a sandwich bag straight away. It's like a little insulation jacket that helps them maintain body temperature because they lack the body fat to stay warm' To my surprise, she was put into a sandwich bag straight away. It was just like any one you would get in  a supermarket. But it apparently simulates the protective environment they’ve just come out of. It’s like a little insulation jacket that helps them maintain body temperature because they lack the body fat to stay warm. I didn’t have time to see her or touch her before she was taken away to the neonatal intensive care unit. I was sick with worry, not knowing if she would live or die. It would be an hour before I saw my daughter for the first time – and instead of that feeling of instant, overwhelming love, I felt panic and horror that she was so small. Surrounded by tubes and on a ventilator, I prayed she would be OK. But it was impossible for anyone to know what would happen next. The medical staff didn’t give us a prognosis and we didn’t dare ask the question, ‘How long will she live?’ I saw her for 20 minutes before I was taken back to the maternity ward and put into a side room. I could hear the happy sounds of other mums with their babies all around me. It was horrendous. The next day I managed to see Emily around lunchtime. Seeing her lying there was every mother’s worst nightmare. Her skin was transparent, her eyes were fused shut and her little hands and feet were still webbed. We couldn’t touch her and spent hours sitting by her incubator. As she made it through the first 24 hours, then the first week, we began to allow ourselves to think that she might pull through. By two weeks, Emily had already needed two blood transfusions. Still nervous, we decided to have her baptised, in case the worst happened. It was a beautiful service, carried out at the side of her incubator. And still Emily fought on. As the days passed, everyone kept saying to us, ‘That’s her through the danger point.’ But that’s not always the case with premature babies. It’s not unusual for their little bodies to become tired at three weeks and they die. I was allowed home but I slept beside the phone with my clothes on, in case the call came to say she was deteriorating. Emily would be one month old before I could finally hold her – a moment which coincided with Mothering Sunday and proved the perfect present. 'We are incredibly proud and in love with her. Her strength and determination are nothing short of amazing' She’d finally opened her eyes and I was getting to hold her for the first time. I enjoyed the wonderful moment I never thought I would see. It was an absolutely amazing feeling. By six weeks, Emily still remained in an incubator but her weight was up to 2lb 5oz and she could be dressed for the first time. I could see small but significant changes as her tiny hands and feet developed properly. Her condition continued to improve so much that, by nine weeks, Emily was finally transferred to Borders General Hospital, just half an hour from our home. But we were brought down to earth with a bump again soon afterwards and reminded how long the road ahead of us is when Emily’s consultant told us she has a heart murmur that will require surgery at some point in the future. The reality of being born at  24 weeks is starting to kick in. The worry of long-term effects and wondering what the future holds for Emily is frightening. But, ten days ago, in another first, I was able to bottle-feed Emily and, last weekend, give her a bath. Those were beautiful moments most mothers take for granted, but after fighting for so long to keep her alive, it was a very precious time for me. Slowly, the equipment has disappeared from my daughter’s room and she is now in a cot, rather than an incubator. It’s very scary seeing it go and will take a bit of getting used to. We are incredibly proud and in love with her. Her strength and determination are nothing short of amazing. She has fought amazingly hard to stay with us.","Emily Cressey was born at just 24 weeks old, weighing little over 1lb .

"Promising: Star rugby player Chris Mapletoft died before receiving his A-Level results . A talented sixth form rugby player has become the latest young person to die after taking a banned fat burning diet pill. Chris Mapletoft, 18, died at home after swallowing DNP, a chemical sold online which is being used as a dangerous quick-fix slimming aid. Although banned for human consumption, the toxic substance itself is not illegal because it is used as a chemical pesticide. Chris had just completed his A-levels at the £15,000-a-year Hampton School in West London and was planning on studying a business degree at university. The bright pupil was also a star of the independent school’s first XV rugby team, winning a player of the tournament trophy last year. His death is the latest in a series of tragedies in the UK blamed on the substance. Earlier this year the Mail reported how medical student Sarah Houston, 23, died after secretly taking DNP along with a prescribed anti-depressant. Those who have overdosed on DNP have likened it to ‘cooking from the inside’, because it can cause the body to overheat. Chris died at home in Twickenham on June 18. At the time, it was believed he may have died from meningitis, but an inquest last week was told the cause of death was the chemical, known as 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP). The coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death. Police are trying to find out where he bought the pills and warned of the risks of DNP. A . spokesman said: ‘Dinitrophenol has no legitimate use as a medicine or . food supplement, and is not safe for human consumption in any form. Gifted: Chris with the 1st XV rugby team at Hampton School, a leading independent boys school in West London. The teenager won player of the tournament last year. His parents did not know he was taking DNP . Tragic: Sarmad Alladin, 18, died in January after taking the drug. Sarah Houston, 23, was found dead last year . A charity has warned of the risks of buying untested drugs and ‘miracle cures’ over the internet after patients told how their health was damaged by bogus medicines. While chatrooms and online forums offer valuable support to sufferers of chronic illnesses, they can also carry advertising and misleading stories, according to Sense About Science. Those taken in by online promotions, who range from dieters to cancer patients, said the consequences can be devastating. Some patients said they were ‘sold false hope’ and ended up aggravating their condition, and even stopped taking their original medication. The report offers advice on how to spot claims about ‘miracle cures’, bogus quick-fixes and untested treatments. Spokesman Tracey Brown said: ‘If a claim about a treatment sounds too good to be true, it probably is. 'We can all make steps towards a culture change on unproven treatments.’ 'It . is a poison which interferes with the normal way the body gets energy . from fat. This can lead, as in this case, to death from overheating.’ Chris’s headteacher Kevin Knibbs said: ‘He was a sportsman but he was also a very serious academic too. Most importantly of all, he was a fantastic guy, much loved and greatly respected here by all of us.’ DNP, . which is popular with bodybuilders, has been linked to 62 deaths . worldwide and has caused three in Britain in the past year. University . of Leeds student Miss Houston died last September. She had been . suffering from bulimia, for which she was seeing a psychiatrist. The night before she died, she took two cold showers to try to cool down after feeling unwell. In February, 18-year-old student  Sarmad Alladin died hours after praising DNP on Facebook. DNP . was originally launched as a slimming aid in the 1930s but was banned . shortly afterwards due to its side-effects. Last month the Food . Standards Agency issued a warning over the availability of the chemical . as a ‘fat-burning substance’. Chris’s family were not available for comment yesterday. DNP is sold as a weight loss aid, but has been described as 'extremely dangerous to human health' by doctors. It is sold mostly over the internet under a number of different names but contains 2, 4-Dinitrophenol. It is marketed mainly to bodybuilders as a weight loss aid as it is thought to dramatically boost metabolism. The manufactured drug is yellow and odourless and was previously used as a herbicide and fungicide. It was launched as a slimming aid in the U.S. in the 1930s but then banned in 1938, due to the severe side-effects. Depending on the amount consumed, signs of acute poisoning could include nausea, vomiting, restlessness, flushed skin, sweating, dizziness, headaches, rapid respiration and irregular heart-beat, possibly leading to coma and death.","Doctors thought Chris Maplecroft had contracted meningitis .

"Afghanistan's cosmopolitan new first lady has backed France's controversial ban on the niqab, comparing the full veil to 'blinders' as she prepares to campaign for more respect for women in her conservative adopted homeland. Rula Ghani shocked Afghan observers earlier this year when she appeared with her husband during the country's presidential campaign, a rare example of a political wife sharing the spotlight. Now the Lebanese-American of Christian heritage is set to carve out a role for herself as the patriarchal and deeply Muslim nation's first high-profile first lady. Afghanistan's cosmopolitan new first lady, Rula Ghani (pictured), has backed France's controversial ban on the niqab . Wearing the full veil in public was banned by French law in 2011 . In an interview with AFP at the presidential palace, Ghani, who speaks five languages, reminisced about her time as a student at the prestigious Sciences Po university in Paris which she attended during the late 1960s. Wearing a vintage Hermes scarf over her hair, she recalled in fluent French that 'all the young women at Sciences Po had their headscarves which they would wear as they stepped out of school'. 'When issues began to arise around the veil and hijab in France, I was a little shocked, people seem to not have a very long memory.' Wearing the full veil in public was banned by French law in 2011, igniting a fierce debate over the value of religious freedom against social cohesion. Ghani said she supported the ban. 'Regarding the French law against the niqab and burqa which prevent women from being able to move freely and see, because the niqab is a bit like blinders, I am in full agreement with the government of France,' Ghani told AFP. The banning of the rull veil in France ignited a fierce debate over the value of religious freedom against social cohesion . It is a typically forthright view from a woman of strong opinions who has already taken a far more prominent role than her predecessor, Zeenat Karzai, who was practically invisible during the 13-year rule of her husband Hamid Karzai. Karzai came to power after a US-led coalition toppled the hardline Taliban government that banned women from leaving their homes without male guardians. Ghani admits she is still trying to define her role, but hopes that by the end of her husband's five-year term, 'men in Afghanistan will be more inclined to recognise whatever role their wives take'. 'In one word, more respect,' she said. Her husband is already leading by example, praising his wife's work with internally displaced people, women and children during his September 29 inauguration speech. By the standards of most women in Afghanistan, who are confined to domestic family roles, Ghani has had an extremely liberated, globe-trotting life. Highly educated, with degrees from leading universities in France, Lebanon - where she met her future husband - and the United States, she spent three years in Kabul with her in-laws during the 1970s while her husband worked as a lecturer. They left for the United States, where he was to pursue his PhD at Columbia University, and could only watch helplessly as their country was invaded by the Soviet Union. Ghani says she benefits from her diverse background, despite being attacked by political rivals during the campaign for being a Christian. 'There are two ways of dealing with it - one is to cling on to one identity alone and the other is to embrace all of them, to try to take advantage of all of them,' she said. Ghani returned to Kabul in 2002 when her husband, then a successful World Bank economist, returned home as the country's finance minister. Though immersed in the affairs of her adopted country, she is a self-professed Francophile who recalls vividly her time in Paris during the student uprising of 1968. 'I found it very refreshing to see people decide that there are certain things they wanted and some things they did not want. It showed some independence of mind,' she said. Her time at the university, together with two years working as a journalist for Agence France-Presse in Beirut, trained her to 'think in a very logical way' she says. At AFP her role involved monitoring Arab radio and press every morning for news related to the political upheavals of the early 1970s. 'It was great training for a journalist, because it taught you to be quick but at the same time you had to be accurate,' she said. Now aged 66, Ghani hailed the work of brave activists and female politicians for breaking new ground for women in Afghanistan despite discrimination and violence. Given the hostility of opponents during the campaign, observers believe Ghani will be forced to strike a delicate balance in her new role - a fact she seems keenly aware of. 'I am kind of finding my way,' she said. 'Listening and trying to understand what is happening in Afghanistan.'","Rula Ghani said the niqab and burqa prevent women from moving freely .

"Aziza Kibibi was only eight-years-old when her father - an MTV award-winning music video director -  started raping her. By 10, Aswad Ayinde's lessons teaching his daughter 'how to be a woman' turned violent and his regular raping produced five children out of incest in a perverse attempt to create a 'pure' bloodline. Ayinde, who is also known as Charles McGill and won fame after directing The Fugees' 'Killing Me Softly' video, was sentenced to 50 years in prison on July 26, finally ending Kibibi's nightmare. The incredibly brave woman, who is now 35, married and running a promising baking business, spoke out about the traumatic childhood this week for the first time. Nightmare: The Pennsylvania case appears to mirror the story of New Jersey woman Aziza Kibibi, pictured, whose father raped her from the age of eight, getting her pregnant five times . Kibibi told NJ.com her childhood started off relatively normal. She lived with her mother and father on the third-floor of an apartment in Paterson, New Jersey, with her Jamaican immigrant grandparents living below. Locked up: Her father, Aswad Ayinde, now faces a combined 90 years in prison for the sexual abuses he committed against two of his daughters . Kibibi was home-schooled but still allowed to play with the neighborhood children. When her family grew to include eight children they moved into a bigger apartment in the same building. It was when Kibibi started to mature that her father started giving her unwanted attention. 'He told me I was special. Initially, it was to teach me to be a woman,' she said. 'By the time he started having intercourse with me, he was getting more and more violent. When I would start fighting him, he would hit me. It was more about threats.' Her father began to change, and became more controlling over the family. He moved them out of their grandparent's apartment to another house in Paterson before relocating to Eatontown in Southern New Jersey. The children were only allowed to watch a small amount of TV, and nothing that depicted traditional family life. Modern medicine was outlawed in the house, and he actually told his wife that his relations with Kibibi were to treat her eczema. Kibibi wasn't the only one Ayinde was having sex with. He had a mistress - a Manhattan lawyer whom he had another two children with - and was also abusing one of Kibibi's sisters. He called himself a polygamist and a prophet. His family was allowed to pray to god but could only do so through him. 'He said the world was going to end, and it was just going to be him and his offspring and that he was chosen,' his ex-wife, Beverly Ayinde testified at a 2010 pre-trial hearing. She said he was attempting to create a 'pure' bloodline by procreating with his daughters. When Kibibi's first child was born without defects, Ayinde took it as proof and continued to rape the girl to get her pregnant. Damaging: Kibibi gave birth to five children by her father, and many of them inherited a rare genetic disorder due to inbreeding . Award winner: Ayinde, who is also known as Charles McGill, won fame after directing the video for 'Killing Me Softly' by The Fugees, pictured . But the following children would not be . so lucky. Two further daughters born from her father would be diagnosed . with phenylketonuria (PKU) a condition that prevents the body from . breaking down amino acids. PKU can cause brain damage and seizures. Dr. Anna Haroutunian, a PKU specialist who has treated Kibibi's children, said they definitely got the condition because of inbreeding. PKU is a recessive gene, so both parents must have the gene in order for it to pass along to the child. The gene only appears at a rate of 1 in 4,000 world wide and is must lower for African-Americans. Likely Kibibi's paternal grandfather had the gene. Better now: Since escaping her father, Kibibi has gotten her GED, married and started her own baking business . Over the years, Kibibi became obsessed with escaping. She would sleep just because her dreams were better than real life. 'I'd dream about running away. I'd dream about getting all my brothers and sisters — one of my sisters was a baby, and I was taking care of her — I'd dream about growing breasts and getting milk and running away with them somewhere,' she said. When she was older and one of her sons fell sick, she finally got the courage to take him to the hospital since Ayinde was out of town on a business trip. But she didn't know how to interact with the doctors and a social worker stepped in, alerting the Department of Youth a Family Services. When Ayinde returned from his business trip he was enraged, and threatened to forcibly remove his son from the hospital. Child services stepped in before he could do that and placed them in separate homes. After that Kibibi, her mother and her sisters moved away from Ayinde as she attempted to get her children back. Her performance in state-mandated courses and counseling impressed the government officials and eventually her children were returned to her. 'She has been an exceptional mother,' Haroutunian said. 'She was so attentive and patient, it's remarkable. For a young girl - with all she's had - she has been just wonderful.' Having to fight to get her children back also empowered Kibibi, and translated to her life after abuse. She now lives in East Orange, New Jersey with her husband. Defects: When Kibibi's first child was born without defects, Ayinde took it as a sign that he was creating a 'pure' bloodline .

"The pilot who landed a passenger plane without wheels after a technical failure has spoken of his 'huge relief' at bringing the aircraft down without injury or loss of life to his 231 passengers. There has been an international outpouring of praise for Captain Tadeusz Wrona, 54, since the incredible footage of his soft landing at Warsaw airport emerged. Capt. Wrona, a father-of-two, gently placed the LOT airlines plane from Newark, New Jersey, on its belly after a technical error disabled the landing gear. Hero's welcome: Captain Tadeusz Wrona (right) and his co-pilot Jerzy Szwarc (left) pictured at a press conference in Warsaw earlier today . In uniform: Wrona has been hailed as a national hero in Poland and has been promised a state honour by the president. Right, Wrona pictured with a glider - some observers say it was his skills landing the delicate gliders that helped him to such a smooth end with the LOT flight . But at a press conference in Warsaw the pilot played down his role. 'We tried to put the plane down as gently as we could and we were successful,' said Wrona, wearing a dark blue pilot's uniform with golden insignia. 'When I stopped on the runway, I still was not sure that everyone was safe because smoke and some burning from friction appeared on the ground. 'I felt huge relief when the head flight attendant reported that the plane was empty.' Wrona appeared slightly uncomfortable with the accolades heaped upon him and said it was an 'exaggeration' to call him a hero. He even said he keeps playing the landing over and over again in his mind, wondering if he might have executed it better. Relief: Passengers from the Boeing 767 were confronted with a media scrum as they disembarked the plane following an horrendous ordeal . Upset: Some traumatised passengers did not want to speak to reporters as they tried to leave the airport but, right, others relived their ordeal for the news crews . Broken but unbowed: The Boeing 767 still sits on the tarmac at Warsaw airport having stood up to the impact of the emergency landing . 'I am absolutely sure that each of us . (pilots) would have done it the same way, and that the result would . have been the same,' said Wrona, one of LOT's most experienced pilots . who had been flying Boeings for 20 years. 'I've flown this plane maybe five hundred times and the landing gear always worked. This time it didn't. 'The awareness that we'll be forced . to make an emergency landing only dawned on me three or four minutes . before we touched down. Earlier we were trying to open the landing gear . again and again. 'I was just thinking we must not allow ourselves to make a mistake and not to make contact with the ground too hard. But while Wrona has played down his role, others have been happy to hail him as a hero. Polish President Bronislaw Kwasniewski has said he will bestow a state decoration on Wrona for his feat. In the U.S, video of Wrona's landing . immediately evoked memories of the 'miracle on the Hudson,' when Captain . Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger landed a crippled U.S. Airways jet in New . York's Hudson River in 2009 and saved 155 lives. Sullenberger is among those who has . praised Wrona, telling the NY Daily News that Wrona's accomplishment . 'required great piloting skills'. Several Facebook pages sprang up to express admiration, with some calling him Wrona a 'superhero.' Drama: Flames and sparks burst from the aircraft as it slides along the ground without any means of braking . Rescue: Fire engines spray fire retardant foam on the LOT Polish airlines plane after it comes to a standstill. Astonishingly none of the  230 people on board was injured . Knock-on effect: Passengers sit next to their luggage as flights were cancelled at Warsaw airport because of the incident with the Boeing 767 . One Facebook page carried the motto . 'Fly like an eagle and land like a crow', playing on the fact that the . word 'wrona' is Polish for crow. As passengers thanked Wrona for his . calm under pressure through the media, more snippets are emerging from . people inside the plane, revealing the sense of foreboding that . pervaded. 'I started to cry, and the men around me were also crying,' said one passenger, Krystyna Dabrowska, 62. 'I thought that was the end of me.' However, the testimony of others . reveals that Wrona's landing was so smooth some pasengers did not even . realise there was a problem with the landing gear. One man told CNN: 'The pilot landed . perfectly. We were sure we landed on wheels. We were clapping our hands . but it turned out there were no wheels.' A female passenger told the same . channel: 'We all thought we had landed with no problem. But I was . sitting near the wings and I saw the parks and smoke.' Wrona himself joked that he heard one passenger in the back complain about feeling a bump on landing. Miraculous: Passengers escaped down the plane's emergency chutes after the landing at Warsaw. No one was injured . Safe landing: The Boeing 767 came down on foam sprayed on the tarmac in an attempt to dampen any fires that broke out . Some have attributed Wrona's skill in landing the plane so gently to his his years of experience as a glider pilot. Andrzej Majchrzak, head of Wrona's . glider club in the southwestern city of Leszno, said that glider pilots . are specially trained to make delicate landings. He said: 'The pilot's skills are of . enormous importance... It takes a very delicate approach to make a . careful touchdown and avoid damaging the glider, which is a very . delicate machine. Majchrzak descibed Wrona, a club . member since 2001, as a 'responsible pilot, not one who would take risks . that could end in tragedy.' Wrona discovered there was a problem about half an hour after leaving Newark, revealed LOT president Marcin Pirog. As Captain Tadeusz Wrona approached the runway in the full knowledge that his aircraft had no usable landing gear his dialogue with the air traffic control tower betrayed no hint of worry, as a recording released to the media has shown. Tower: 'Flight 16 you have permission to land. Wind calm, four knots.' Wrona: 'We have permission to land. Thank you.' Tower: 'Flight 16, report landing strip in sight.' Wrona: 'Strip in sight.' Tower: 'Good luck.' The pilot only told passengers four . hours into the flight - at 1:40 pm Polish time - that the plane faced . technical problems. An hour later he alerted the crew and passengers . they were about to land. Two F-16s dispatched by the Polish Air Force quickly confirmed the landing gear was not coming down. Seeing no other alternative, Wrona . circled the airport for an hour and dumped whatever fuel was left in the . tanks in preparation for the emergency landing. One passenger said that exiting the plane amid such commotion was more frightening than the ordeal inside the cabin. 'Looking back at the plane smoking . and 50 fire trucks surrounding it spraying foam puts it in perspective . how close a call it really was,' Greg Cohen, 42, a boxing promoter from . Manhattan told the NY Daily News. The State Commission for Examining Air Accidents has opened an investigation into the reason for of the malfunction. Polish national carrier LOT said the . plane suffered 'a central hydraulic system failure,' indicating that the . hydraulics used to extend the landing gear, or undercarriage, failed. The failure of an entire . undercarriage was unprecedented for a Boeing 767 and highly unusual . overall, according to aviation data and experts. Wrona himself said he had no fears about flying the very same plane again. 'I will pilot it again with pleasure because it is one of the newest planes in the LOT fleet,' Wrona said. 'I hope it can be repaired. These are very well-made planes.' The stranded plane is currently lying . on the junction between two runways and Boeing specialists from the U.S . have flown out to advise on how best to move the stricken plane. The airport has been closed since the drama took place and postponed flights are backing up. 'Maybe it would have been better for . the company if the slide on the belly ended 300 meters further down the . runway,' Wrona joked. 'But Boeing manuals don't say how far the plane can slide on its belly.'","Captain Tadeusz Wrona, 54, saved the lives of 231 passengers .

"Twenty years since the first item was sold online, 95 per cent of British people are now buying goods via internet retailers. On August 11, 1994, the Sting album 'Ten Summoner’s Tales' became the first online purchase for £7.74 and since then, people have taken to online shopping in their millions. Last year, more than £91 billion was spent online and that figure is expected to surpass £100 billion this year. Scroll down for video . More than 25 per cent of British people surveyed in the research conducted by UK retailer Shop Direct said they shopped online while in bed (stock image used) According to new research conducted by UK retailer Shop Direct, one in four British people now shop online at least once a week. The rising number of people using tablets has also played a part, with one in five of the 1,000 surveyed saying they used their device to shop and one in ten using a smartphone. Such is the enthusiasm for digital shopping, more than 25 per cent said they shop online in bed, while one in 20 said part of their morning commute involves some virtual window shopping. On August 11, 1994, the Sting album 'Ten Summoner’s Tales' became the first online purchase for £7.74 and since then, people have taken to online shopping in their millions . Interestingly, the most commonly purchased online item are books, which make up 64 per cent of online buys. This was followed by clothes and accessories with 59.6 per cent, music and entertainment with 55.7 per cent, electronics 54.3 per cent and holiday and travel 50.3 per cent. The rise of online shopping has also been quite rapid, as on average most Brits did not start to use the web for shopping until 2005 and only 12 per cent doing so before the turn of the century. Fiona Ellis Chadwick, senior lecturer in retail management at The Open University Business School, said: 'The early days of online shopping were very basic and the customer experience wasn't fantastic. 'Few Brits had a computer and those that did had very slow internet access, which would take a long time to load an image let alone order a product. 'The customer experience has drastically changed since 1994. British people have increasingly turned away from the high street and bought more items online. This year, online purchases are expected to surpass £100 billion . 'In the early days of online shopping, we would go to the high street and look through various shops and choose from what was on offer.

December 2008: MFI, the furniture retailer, was one of the first major firms to go out of business at the start of the downturn, as retail sales began to fall following a sharp rise in unemployment. January 2009: Woolworths shut its 800 stores, bringing home to many the scale of the UK's economic collapse as the country entered recession for the first time. February 2009: Zavvi stopped trading around Christmas - and refused to honour its gift cards, leading to widespread customer anger. December 2009: Borders was another entertainment behemoth to go under as sale of CDs and DVDs were squeezed by digital downloads and online retailers. October 2012: JJB Sports closed all but 20 of its stores, which were taken over and re-branded by Sports Direct - which saw 550 employees losing their jobs. December 2012: Comet shut down just before Christmas, leaving nearly 7,000 staff out of work and forcing the taxpayer to pick up a £50million tab related to its bankruptcy, which was blamed on soaring energy prices and a reduction in the number of home buyers. January 2013: Jessops was closed by administrator PwC earlier this month after years of struggling with online competition as customers turned away from traditional photography. January 2013: HMV, which has 239 shops and 4,500 staff, announced that it was calling in administrators. The company came under fire for not honouring gift vouchers which they had been selling all over Christmas. November 2013: Video and DVD chain Blockbuster entered administration. The store had 264 stores and a 2,000-strong workforce. December 2013: Osborne's, one of the UK's oldest retailers established in 1830, went into administration early in December. There are 20 stores, three stores have already been closed, and 140 staff have been affected. 2014: Tie Rack, the necktie, scarf and accessories fashion retailer, is to close its 44 high-street stores and continue as an online retailer. In the 1980s there were 450 stores and along with Sock Shop, Principles and Laura Ashley. March 2014: Albemarle & Bond, one of the largest pawnbrokers in the UK, went into administration towards the end of March. There are 188 shops and 1,000 employees.

'But more important for her was to really go out there and give other people the courage that you can still do so much, even if you have such a major setback.

"A teenage professional footballer attacked two nightclub bouncers while shouting racist abuse and claiming he was a 'gipsy fighter' during a night out to mark his birthday, a court heard. Crewe Alexandra winger Ryan Colclough, 19, was in the Liquid nightclub in Hanley, Staffordshire, when he was alleged to have racially abused bouncer Mo Khan and threatened to kill him. Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court was told Colclough was then thrown out of the club, but the trouble continued outside, with Colclough claiming to be a 'gipsy fighter' and punching another doorman. Footballer: Crewe Alexandra winger Ryan Colclough, 19, (left) is accused of attacking two bouncers at the Liquid nightclub in Hanley, Staffordshire, (right) while shouting racist abuse and claiming he was a 'gipsy fighter' during a night out to mark his birthday . The winger denies assault occasioning actual bodily harm, racially aggravated assault by beating, and racially aggravated intentional harassment, alarm or distress. Stuart Clarkson, prosecuting, said Liquid door supervisor Mr Khan was alerted to Colclough’s behaviour inside the venue at 2am on December 27 last year. 'Mr Khan simply wanted a word about what may or may not have happened,' he said. In action: Colclough, (left) from Stanfield, Staffordshire, is playing in his second season with League One club Crewe Alexandra, and has scored two goals this year . Nightspot: The court heard Colclough punched one bouncer, Mo Khan, and was then thrown out of the club, only to  punch another doorman, Stuart Mann, above his eyebrow . Denial: Colclough claims he acted in self-defence, saying he says he was the victim, and the door staff were the aggressors . 'The defendant did not want to speak to him. 'Mr Khan tapped him on the arm and asked if he could speak to him. The defendant shrugged away. 'He was not going to be spoken to about anything, as far as Mr Khan was concerned. 'Another door staff member attended and Mr Khan took hold of Colclough’s arm. 'The effect was Colclough punched Mr Khan to his temple and then delivered a second blow to the right side of his jaw. 'There was a struggle and both men fell to the floor. As this was going on, the defendant was shouting racial abuse at Mr Khan.' The court heard Colclough was then thrown out of the club where he then punched another doorman, Stuart Mann, above his eyebrow. Mr Khan told the court: 'I tapped him on the arm to get his attention. I got his attention, but with a blow to the side of my head, on the right temple. 'Once I got him to the floor the racial abuse started. He said, ""Wait until I get you, I am going to kill you, you dirty scumbag"". 'Outside, he started being aggressive to me and Stuart. He claimed to be a gipsy fighter. He said, ""You scumbag, go back to your own country"". 'He managed to punch Stuart above the eyebrow.' Colclough, from Stanfield, Staffordshire, claims he acted in self-defence. He says he was the victim, and the door staff were the aggressors. The footballer is playing in his second season with League One club Crewe Alexandra, and has scored two goals this year.

"The body of an animal lover was gnawed and eaten by her own cats after she died at home alone, a court heard. The decomposing corpse of Janet Veal, 56, was discovered on the kitchen floor of her isolated house in Ringwood, Hampshire, on April 4. Neighbours had raised the alarm having not seen her for some time and noticing that her letterbox was overflowing, Southampton Coroner's Court was told. Isolated: Mrs Veal's body was found at her home at the end of a farm track off Crow Arch Lane in Ringwood, Hampshire . Police were forced to use a ladder to enter the semi-detached property, which is at the end of a 100-yard farm track, through an unsecured upstairs window. Inside they found 'a distressing scene'. There were a number of dead animals - including a cat and a dog - in the kitchen and living room, but others had survived. It is believed the hungry animals had begun to eat their owner after being left without food for months. PC Dave Ivey said the house had clearly not been aired for numerous weeks and he could . not see the floor for all the rubbish. The court heard that Mrs Veal was something of a recluse and had become estranged from her husband. Recording a death from natural causes, coroner Keith Wiseman said: 'These animals had been, the officer thought, confined in these two rooms downstairs for what may well have been a period of many weeks, stretching quite possibly into several months.' Evidence: Southampton Coroner's Court heard how police officers discovered the 'distressing scene' on April 4 . He added: 'This too was a distressing experience because it was clear that certain parts of Mrs Veal’s body were missing and had, the officer formed the view, effectively been gnawed and eaten away by the animals. 'One can only imagine the difficulty with the scene the officer was having to deal with.' Mr Wiseman concluded Mrs Veal had been eaten by her cats after she died as her body lay in the kitchen for weeks. She had suffered from various chest conditions in the past, it was heard. Mr Wiseman said: 'Exactly what happened to render Mrs Veal unable to assist herself or get any kind of help is unclear.

"Researchers have developed a method to activate electronic implants in the body and eliminate bacterial infections using a wireless signal. When triggered by remote technology, the gadget delivers heat to infected tissue. And it could lead to technologies that enable drugs and treatment to be delivered to patients at the press of a button. US researchers have developed a device to treat infections wirelessly. An electronic implant (illustrated) was activated by a wireless signal. It used a heater to treat tissue that had been infected with staph. And one researcher said it could be a precursor to drugs being delivered via Wi-Fi activation in the future . The technology was developed by researchers at Tufts University in Massachusetts and the University of Illinois. Mice were given electronic implants that, when a signal was sent, heated up to treat tissue that was infected with staphylococcus, or staph, which can cause minor skin abscesses or life-threatening infections of the blood. Tissues collected from the mice 24 hours after treatment showed no sign of the infection, while the device dissolved in 15 days, proving it can not only treat infections but also be disposed of easily. The research, which also eliminated E. coli bacteria, was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The researchers at Tufts University School of Engineering demonstrated for the first time a dissolving electronic implant, made of silk and magnesium. It was used to eliminate bacterial infection in mice by delivering heat to infected tissue when triggered by a remote wireless signal. The devices then harmlessly dissolved. In vitro studies also showed the devices could kill bacteria by releasing antibiotics. This is an important step forward for future development of on-demand medical devices that can be turned on remotely to perform a therapeutic function, such as managing post-surgical infection, and then degrade in the body. Each device, made of silk and magnesium, harmlessly dissolved in the animals after the tests. The heating device in the implants has a resistor and power-receiving coil made of magnesium, and the magnesium is wrapped in 'packet' of silk, keeping it safe and controlling its dissolution time. The ability of the device to dissolve is important, as it means such implants would not need to be removed. Implantable medical devices normally use non-degradable materials that have limited operational lifetimes and must eventually be removed or replaced. But these new wireless therapy devices can handle the surgical process, and can then dissolve in minutes or weeks, depending on the time needed. 'This is an important demonstration step forward for the development of on-demand medical devices that can be turned on remotely to perform a therapeutic function in a patient and then safely disappear after their use, requiring no retrieval,' said senior author Fiorenzo Omenetto, professor of biomedical engineering at Tufts School of Engineering. 'These wireless strategies could help manage post-surgical infection, for example, or pave the way for eventual Wi-Fi drug delivery.'

"Halfway through his term, French President Francois Hollande used a rare prime-time TV appearance Thursday to double down on his pledge not to run again if he makes no headway cutting France's stubbornly high unemployment. It was only the embattled president's second prime-time TV interview since he came to office in May 2012. Polls this week showed his popularity falling to new lows, around 12 per cent. EU Commission forecasts this week make grim reading for Hollande. France's unemployment is forecast to stay above 10 percent through 2016, compared to 9.8 per cent when Hollande came to office. Last April, when Hollande first made the pledge, unemployment was about 10.1 per cent . SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Fitted for a noose?: Hollande has promised not to run for re-election if the French jobs picture doesn't improve – and the clock is ticking . Hollande, the most unpopular French president in history, faced economic questions from four citizen panelists on Thursday . Hollande used the interview to defend his record but was hard-pressed by a panel of four regular citizens chosen by the TV channel that organized the broadcast event. One member of the panel, small business owner Karine Charbonnier, was particularly combative and took the president to task for not doing enough to help ease businesses' burden. Hollande admitted it was a 'mistake' when he promised in 2012 that the unemployment rate would decrease by the end of 2013. And he said his priority is to boost France's growth through a total of 40 billion of tax cuts for companies and a goal of cutting 50 billion euros in state spending by 2017, including 21 billion next year. 'From next year, there will be no new tax', he said. Hollande is exactly half-way through his five-year term and won't run again if unemployment doesn't improve . Hollande also promised to allow shops to open on Sunday in cities with many tourists. In a twist the TV organizers of the interview launched a Twitter hashtag, #DirectPR, to elicit questions from people following the program online. Much of the online commentary under that hashtag was harshly critical of Hollande's performance. A tweet by French daily Le Monde journalist Thomas Wieder that said 'In the newsroom we are hesitating between describing this as ""a shipwreck"" or ""a slaughter""' was retweeted nearly 300 times.","France's 10 per cent unemployment has given Hollande a 10 per cent job approval rating .

"A drunk British man who was arrested on a Cuba-bound Thomas Cook flight after threatening cabin crew and passengers was on his honeymoon, it has emerged. The man, named as Mohammed Khelya, from Blackburn, Lancashire,  threatened to kill cabin crew members and passengers. He was so unruly that he forced the plane to divert to Bermuda and was escorted off it by police - with his wife continuing on to Cuba without him. Khelya had been drinking from a bottle of duty-free vodka before quarreling with his wife when he was taken in handcuffs to the rear of the aircraft and forced its unscheduled landing, prosecutors said. Wed alert: A drunk British man who was arrested (pictured) on a Cuba-bound  flight after threatening to kill cabin crew and passengers was on his honeymoon . Diversion: The man, named as Mohammed Khelya, from Blackburn, Lancashire, became so unruly that he forced the plane to change course and land at Bermuda . Appearing on Tuesday at a court in Hamilton, Bermuda's . capital, a contrite Khelya pleaded guilty to being drunk on the . aircraft and to threatening flight staff. 'I don't know how I'm going to forgive myself,' he said in . court. 'I don't know how she's going to forgive me,' he added, . referring to his wife. Khelya, 22, and his wife were among 311 passengers on board . a Thomas Cook flight, which set out from Manchester . International Airport. Several hours into the flight, after his wife changed seats . to get away from him, Khelya appealed unsuccessfully to a crew . member to see her. 'I'm going to kill you and I'm going to kill everyone . after,' Khelya told a crew member, using an expletive, according . to prosecutors. When asked to stop drinking, he replied: 'So what if I f*****g am?' As flight attendants moved a handcuffed Khelya to the back . of the plane, he spat at other passengers, compelling crew . members to use blankets to protect them, prosecutors said. He further panicked passengers by taking pictures of the inside of the cabin despite being told it was against flight regulations. Diverted to the L.F. Wade International Airport, the flight . was greeted by police officers, who escorted Khelya off the . plane. On Tuesday, Magistrate Khamisi Tokunbo fined Khelya $2,000 (£1275) for being drunk on the aircraft and another $1,000 (£650)for his . abusive behavior towards flight staff. If Khelya fails to pay . the fines, he faces four months in a Bermuda jail. An attorney for Khelya could not immediately be reached for . comment. Newly weds: The man was on board a plane operated by Thomas Cook (file photo) The Thomas Cook flight left Manchester at 10.30am on Monday and was forced to stop in Bermuda at about 6pm. Video footage, taken from http://bernews.com, shows the man dressed in a white T-shirt and appearing to cover his face as he is led off the plane by three police officers. A Thomas Cook spokesman said yesterday: 'Thomas Cook Airlines can confirm that flight TCX244 from Manchester to Holguin, Cuba, diverted to Bermuda and a customer was removed from the aircraft and detained by local police. 'We operate a zero-tolerance policy towards any behaviour on board our aircraft that affects the safety and welfare of our customers and crew.

"A heady mix of infatuation and attraction, the unmistakable flutter  in your stomach and the realisation you are in love. Your appetite wanes as you anxiously look forward to seeing the object of your affections, and your mind wanders, their presence occupying your every thought. But a surge in your libido and a rise in testosterone levels in the body can leave you more prone to suffering an outbreak of unsightly spots, scientists say. A new psychological study of couples  identified the five stages of love - butterflies, building, assimilation, honesty and stability. Scroll down for video . A new study by dating website eHarmony has identified the five stages of love - butterflies, building, assimilation, honesty and stability . Those taking part were asked to complete a psychological test to determine their true feelings. The findings, collated by dating website eHarmony, were grouped into five stages. Participants were asked questions about their behaviour and lifestyle, in order to uncover the impact love has on a person's health at each stage. Psychologist Dr Linda Papadopoulos, who assisted with the study, told MailOnline the aim was to establish if there are distinct stages of love, how people feel and what happens to them physiologically. She said: 'It's fascinating to note that this one core emotion can be broken down into such distinct stages. 'What's more, each stage may be relived and recaptured as couples grow into a relationship, and face different life challenges together.' Psychologist Dr Linda Papadopoulous said the different stages of love impact on our health, causing weight loss, a lack of sleep and raised stress levels . STAGE ONE: BUTTERFLIES . And the findings suggest of the 33 million Britons currently in a relationship, two per cent - or 588,000 people - were found to be enjoying stage one. Marked by intense infatuation and sexual attraction, symptoms noted by couples included weight loss (30 per cent) and a lack of productivity (39 per cent). Biologically, it's reported that during this early stage of dating, both men and women create more of the sex hormones testosterone and oestrogen. As a result more than half - 56 per cent - noted an increase in their libido. Dr Papadopoulos told MailOnline: 'First comes butterflies - we have all felt it, it's visceral - you just feel it. 'Butterflies is a great way to describe it, the time when you can't stop having sex. 'We found people almost forget to eat, there is a sense people are full on love. 'Productivity is not great at this stage, as people's minds constantly wander. 'And interestingly, people tend to get pimples in the early stages of a relationship. 'This is because increases in testosterone cause a rise in sebum, which can block pores and cause a breakout.' STAGE TWO: BUILDING . As the initial attraction gives way to learning more about one another, the honeymoon stage subsides and a couple begin to build their relationship. eHarmony's study estimated around three per cent of Britons in relationship are currently at stage two. The body releases neurochemicals called monoamines, which speed up heart rate, trigger rushes of intense pleasure and replicate the effects of Class A drugs. The biological effect culminates in a feeling of 'happy anxiety', where people can think of little else than their blossoming relationship. Forty-four per cent of the study participants noted a lack of sleep while 29 per cent reported a their attention span had been adversely affected. 'Love changes, it moves slightly further to the point where you are building your relationship, getting you know your partner,' Dr Papadopoulos said. 'You may find your attention span is really awful, and you're not able to focus. 'It can also be difficult sleeping, you're literally kept awake thinking about the other person. And there is a sense of happy anxiety, where you feel drunk on love.' STAGE THREE: ASSIMILATION . Having established whether the other person is 'right', stage three forces a couple to question whether the 'relationship' itself is right. Questions over the future of the union and forming boundaries in the relationship can lead to a rise in stress levels, reported by 27 per cent of those taking part in the study. Stage one increases libido, while stage two releases chemicals that replicate the effects of Class A drugs. Love can also impact weight loss, stress levels and sleep patterns . Dr Papadopolous said: 'The third stage is when it becomes more serious, you start thinking ""this is more serious than I thought"", and ""I know you but where are you at in your life, do we want the same things"", and ""can we figure this out"". 'You begin to see that you assimilate that person into your life.' STAGE FOUR: HONESTY . She said this combined with stage four, where people open up showing the 'real you' sees the first real rise in stress levels and anxiety. 'This stage deals with the concept behind how we all put on our best faces, through social media we edit our lives as well as our pictures to make it appear as though everything is fine,' she said. Opening up completely triggered feelings of doubt and increased vulnerability in 15 per cent of participants. Dr Papadopolous said: 'Interestingly stages three and four see an increase in stress levels. 'Up until now it has been wonderful, feelings of happiness and being content. 'But the more serious the relationship becomes, the more people worry, ""is it what I think it is""?' 'Vulnerability and stress can manifest itself in various ways, causing unease and obsessiveness around the relationship.' STAGE FIVE: STABILITY . But if a couple can weather the emotional rollercoaster of the first four stages, the fifth and final stage, stability, brings with it increased levels of trust and intimacy. eHarmony found 50 per cent of respondents had reached this stage, and 23 per cent reported feeling happier as a result. Biologically, vasopressin - a powerful hormone released by men and women during orgasm - strengthens feelings of attachment. The fifth stage, stability, brings with it increased levels of trust and intimacy after weathering the emotional rollercoaster of a relationship . Meanwhile oxytocin - released during childbirth - deepens feelings of attachment. 'This is where we see a real level of contentness,' Dr Papadopolous told MailOnline. 'We found the body releases wonderful hormones which helps couples bond. We noted a real sense of attachment, and a sense of ""you have got my back and I've got yours"". Jemima Wade, spokesperson for eHarmony.co.uk, said: 'Here at eHarmony, we're responsible for tens of thousands of relationships and millions of ""butterfly"" moments every year as a result of getting to know both the heads and hearts of our members.' 'While love doesn't have a rule book, our unique compatibility system matches members on the 29 key personality dimensions needed for a successful relationship including emotional temperament, core values and social skills – giving singles the best possible matches and better dates.'","eHarmony study identified the stages as butterflies, building, assimilation, honesty and stability .

"Airports have been advised to impose tougher restrictions on alcohol sales in the departure lounge after new figures revealed the number of 'disruptive' incidents on flights has tripled over the last three years. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said 114 cases of 'disruptive passengers' were recorded last year, including bomb threats, assaults on cabin crew, smoking in the toilets and trying to gain entry to the cockpit. The figure for 2014 compared with 85 instances in 2013, 47 in 2012 and 39 in 2011, on British planes. Scroll down for video . Last year a hen party was involved in a fight on board a Ryanair flight to Barcelona . The Civil Aviation Authority said 114 cases of 'disruptive passengers' were recorded on British planes last year, prompting officials to encourage airports to impose tougher restrictions on alcohol sales (file picture) But despite the sharp rise in recent years, the problem is not as acute as it was in the late 1990s, the CAA said. Alcohol has been cited as a factor in the stark increase, with passengers consuming large amounts in departure lounges while waiting to board their flight. Of the cases recorded by the aviation watchdog, 34 related to assaults on either cabin crew or passengers, while 18 involved smoking in the plane's toilet. The CAA revealed that in one incident a passenger had 'attempted to vacate the aircraft' during a flight in August last year. In another flight, which departed London's Heathrow Airport on December 3, a passenger was caught 'interfering with the aircraft heating systems' during take-off. March 25 on a flight to Palma in Majorca a passenger stood up during the landing and assaulted another passenger. On a June 16 flight a fight broke out on board, with the crew assaulted and police having to meet the plane on arrival. A male passenger on a July 17 flight removed all his clothes and tried to open an aircraft door. He refused to don his clothes and was placed in a blanket away from other passengers. On a December 9 flight a passenger consuming his own alcohol became abusive, attempted to light a cigarette and had to be restrained by four crew members using cuffs and straps. He remained loud, offensive and threatening until the plane landed. On an April 16 flight about to leave Cancun in Mexico a passenger, who had been drinking, and a companion were ordered off the plane by the captain after becoming abusive and ripping a tray table from the seat. Ground crew had to be used to get the pair off. On October 19 a passenger pushed her way on board and flatly refused to comply with any of a cabin crew or captain’s instructions and physically assaulted them both. Police escorted her from the plane. On a January 21 flight two passengers threw hot coffee at each other after engaging in an argument over seating space. The two were separated and treated for burns. Police met the plane. A February 2 flight involved a passenger physically assaulting a cabin crew member when asked to stop drinking and trying to light a pipe during the descent into land. The passenger was restrained by crew and two passengers with authorities meeting the plane. One industry insider told The Times that many of the incidents were linked to 'long-haul stag parties', with groups drinking heavily before travelling to destinations such as Las Vegas, Marbella in Spain and Ibiza. Nathan Stower, chief executive of the British Air Transport Association, told the newspaper: 'Airlines set tough rules around the consumption of alcohol and can refuse to carry someone who is drunk to prevent disruptive behaviour and ensure the safety and security of their passengers and crew. 'Pubs, bars and restaurants in the UK and overseas must play their part.' A CAA spokesman added: 'The number of incidents last year did rise but we have also seen an increase in the number of flights. Cabin crew are getting better trained to deal with incidents and could be reporting more of them.' 'There is no excuse for rude or aggressive conduct by passengers towards cabin crew or fellow passengers on board aircraft. It is actually a specific criminal offence to be drunk on board an aircraft, and also to refuse to comply with instructions from the captain. 'We support UK airlines' efforts to deal with disruptive passengers to ensure the safety of all those on board, and welcome criminal prosecutions where appropriate.' Last week, a Ryanair flight to Dublin had to be diverted to Denmark after a 'drunk' man stripped semi-naked and allegedly started throwing punches. The flight was on its way to Ireland from Riga in Latvia February 10 when the man removed his shirt and began flexing his muscles at the plane's rear. The plane was forced to make the unscheduled landing at Aarhus Airport in Tirstrup, Denmark, and the man was arrested. Last month, two passengers were also arrested after allegedly fighting while on a holiday jet as it prepared to take off from Glasgow to the Canary Islands. The men, both aged in their fifties, were arrested on board the Thomson flight bound for Fuerteventura as it prepared to leave Scotland. The flight was delayed by about one-hour-and-a-half as police boarded the plane to remove the passengers and unload their bags. A Ryanair flight was diverted to Denmark last week after a man, who was reportedly drunk, removed his shirt . A police spokesman said the man did not resist arrest after he was 'subdued and tied up' by other passengers . A woman claiming to be a teacher was also arrested last month after allegedly becoming drunk and slapping the backsides of cabin crew on an easyJet flight. The 23-year-old and her partner were said to have become abusive while on the delayed flight from Faro, Portugal, to Southend, Essex, on January 3. Naomi Campbell, 44 . Supermodel Naomi Campbell was banned from flying with British Airways after a violent outburst on a plane. The 44-year-old was arrested at Heathrow's Terminal 5 in 2008 after clashing with BA staff over a missing bag. After rowing with cabin staff on the London-Los Angeles flight, she assaulted a police officer who came on board in an attempt to defuse the argument. Campbell later pleaded guilty to assaulting two police officers and was sentenced to 200 hours of community service and fined £2,300. According to other passengers the woman repeatedly said she was a schoolteacher while slapping the backsides of cabin crew as they passed, swearing loudly and abusing staff. The pair were arrested for endangering the lives of fellow passengers after they were removed from the plane, which had been delayed for seven hours by technical problems. The CAA said the 114 incidents recorded last year were a relatively small amount compared to the two million flights which depart UK airports each year. And flight crews in the US dealing with an increasing number of 'air rage' incidents have called for bigger fines for unruly passengers. The Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) deals with around 150 air rage incidents complaints every year and over the past 20 years has had to take action against more than 4,000 passengers. The organisation released a statement saying that repercussions for passengers who engage in unruly behavior can be substantial, but unions disagree about whether the current system of fines actually works. Although substantial fines are often levied against passengers who become violent or disrupt flights, more often than not fines are settled for far less than the original demand, or left unpaid altogether, an investigation by USA Today and NBC News has revealed. A drunk passenger who became violent on board a flight in 2012 was fined $15,000 (£9,900) but paid nothing due to 'financial hardship', research showed. The same year a disruptive passenger fined $5,000 (£3,200) ended up settling with the FAA for $200 (£130) One woman appears to have her head pushed into the overhead lockers as a brawl broke out over a row concerning a crying child on a Chinese flight from to Chongqing to Hong Kong just before Christmas . The report showed that between 2009 and 2013, the FAA fined passengers around £1million, but settled for less than half that amount due to pleas of poor mental health, substance abuse or financial hardship. It emerged this week that passengers who misbehave on commercial flights in China could soon find themselves grounded. The Civil Aviation Administration of China said it was considering steps to blacklist offending passengers but said no firm decision had been made on the proposed 'no fly list'. It also revealed that disruptive passengers could face prosecution if they cause disruption or breach the proposed blacklist restrictions. Photos posted on the Weibo social-networking website show a flight attendant covering her face after she was scolded by a passenger throwing hot noodles . China has for some time experienced problems with disruptive passengers, many losing their tempers, with others claiming not to be aware of the rules of air travel. A brawl involving three women erupted on a Chinese flight from to Chongqing to Hong Kong just before Christmas when two of them complained to a mum that her baby was making too much noise. The women, all believed to be Chinese, were warned that the pilot would be forced to turn back and make an emergency landing if they didn't stop fighting. And only a few days before a female passenger, from China, attacked the flight attendant with a cup of noodles in a violent row that began when she found out that she wouldn't be sitting next to her boyfriend on a charter flight from Bangkok to Nanjing, China.","114 cases of 'disruptive passengers' recorded on British planes last year .

"Manchester City's most famous fan has admitted that the blue half of Manchester may never be as big a club as their city rivals. Former Oasis frontman Noel Gallagher also said that City shouldn't be expanding their stadium, as they can't even fill its current capacity. Speaking before Sunday's Manchester derby, Gallagher told Gary Neville that City had changed for the better, but will never be able to rival United as a brand. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail's PL Preview: Manchester City vs Manchester United . Noel Gallagher in conversation with Manchester United legend Gary Neville before Sunday's derby . Large sections of the Etihad stadium appeared empty during the Champions League clash with Roma . Gallagher says that City should not be expanding their stadium while they can't fill its current capacity . 'When you started it went from a big club to a mega brand,' Gallagher said to Neville on Sky Sports. 'I don't think City can ever get that.' 'I'm not sure it's a good idea to boost that stadium to 60,000.Because, really, if we were going to get that there'd be 10,000 locked out the stadium every week. When you look at the games and go to the games, there are empty seats.' However, the City fan also hit out at United supporters over their perceived hypocrisy about spending power. Gallagher hit out at the hypocrisy of United spending big on the likes of Angel di Maria and Luke Shaw . 'It's the hypocrisy I hate,' continued Gallagher. 'They've been slagging City off for years and as soon as the big bad wolf's out the door, it's raining tenners!' City have been successful in the fixture in recent times, winning five of the last six Premier League meetings. And with his team finishing a massive 22 points clear of United last season, it is perhaps justified that Gallagher said he would only want David de Gea at his club out of Louis van Gaal's squad. The former Oasis frontman admitted that his beloved City would never be as big a brand as Manchester United . Gallagher did admit that he would take David de Gea (left) for City if he could, but as a No 2 to Joe Hart (right) 'I'd take the goalie, straight away,' Gallagher conceded, before joking: 'He could carry Joe [Hart's] kit around, he's a good No 2. Gallagher also couldn't resist goading Neville about City's first Premier League win over their rivals, when the United defender was at fault for a Shaun Goater goal. The musician described it as one of his favourite derby memories, before adding that 'It was a special moment'. 'We all knew you were getting the hair-dryer the moment you got in that dressing room.'

"A planned two-day strike by Lufthansa pilots is threatening to create more chaos for holidaymakers and business travellers. German pilots’ union VC is calling a strike for Monday and Tuesday after talks broke down over retirement benefits. It is the ninth time this year that Lufthansa pilots have staged a walkout. Grounded: Lufthansa pilots are staging a two-day walkout after talks broke down over retirement benefits . The VC union said the Germany-wide strike would last from midday on Monday to 11:59pm on Tuesday for short- and medium-haul flights, as well as from early morning to late evening on Tuesday for long-haul flights. Pilots flying for Lufthansa Cargo will also strike on Tuesday. Flights operated by budget arm Germanwings are not affected. Cologne-based Lufthansa has not said how many flights are expected to be cancelled during the strike. A similar walkout in October affected more than 200,000 travellers as the carrier was forced to cancel hundreds of flights, including dozens between destinations in the UK and Germany. Misery: A strike in October forced Lufthansa to cancel hundreds of flights . Lufthansa and its pilots are at odds over proposed changes to an early retirement scheme that was developed decades ago. The airline said the latest strike is completely disproportionate and called for an immediate resumption of talks. It said it made concessions in recent talks, including a five per cent pay rise, but reiterated that it would not accept a demand that new pilots, as well as those already with the company, should be able to retire at 55. This is the ninth time this year that Lufthansa pilots have gone on strike . The ongoing dispute has been costly for Lufthansa. Eight previous walkouts by staff this year wiped more than £125m off the carrier's operating profit, adding to pressure from a stuttering global economy and increased competition. Lufthansa plans to use other pilots from within the group who are not on expensive collective labour agreements to staff tourist routes, where the brand, which usually focuses on business travellers, is trying to reduce costs. Passenger transport in Germany has also been disrupted by train drivers' strikes this year.","German pilots' union is calling a strike for Monday and Tuesday .

"Claims: Zacarias Moussaoui, who is serving a life sentence for terror charges, has said Saudi Arabia financed the 9/11 attacks . A jihadist serving life in prison on terror charges brought in the wake of 9/11 has claimed the Saudi Arabian royal family helped finance the plot. Zacarias Moussaoui, 46, says an unnamed Saudi Prince paid for flying lessons for him and the 19 terrorists who hijacked planes in the September 11 attacks in the run-up to the atrocities. The incredible claims were made in documents filed to a federal court in Oklahoma, in which Moussaoui says a prince 'was assisting me in my Islamic terrorist activities... and was doing so knowingly for Osama bin Laden'. He also said that bin Laden provided assistance from Saudi leaders in planning the attacks, and that he was involved in a plot to shoot down Air Force One with President Bill Clinton on board. The Saudi government has flatly denied any involvement in 9/11. Moussaoui's own credibility is also suspect - as even Osama bin Laden has denied he had anything to do with his terrorist plots. Lawyers for the Federal government have taken him seriously enough to interview him over the claims at the maximum security Colorado prison where he is serving a life sentence without parole. They say he had 'relevant' material to contribute. However, officials in Oklahoma have said Moussaoui's requests to be allowed to speak in open court and to be assigned government lawyers will probably be denied, as his claims have nothing to do with any existing cases. 'Even if he somehow got to the point where he could testify, there would be a credibility issue,' said Carl Tobias, a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law. 'Would his testimony be valuable? That's doubtful.' Court battles: Moussaoui cut a bizarre figure in his three-year-long trial on terror charges. Above, a court sketch shows him celebrating as he is sentenced to life in a maximum security prison . The offers are also clouded by his record of changing his account of his involvement in the Sept. 11 plot and his erratic behavior in court. In court papers filed in Manhattan in September, lawyers for Saudi Arabia said flatly: 'The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia had no role in the attacks of September 11, 2001.' They also noted that the United States 'has said often and vigorously that Saudi Arabia is an important ally in the fight against terrorism.' Even so, his attempts to cooperate in the civil cases stand in contrast to the defiant attitudes of other al-Qaida defendants who have endured after years of confinement without volunteering information except for claims they were tortured. Moussaoui, who is 46 and refers to himself in writing as 'Slave of Allah,' was first arrested on immigration charges in August 2001 after employees of a Minnesota flight school became alarmed that he wanted to learn to fly a Boeing 747 - even though he had no pilot's license. Atrocity: According to Moussaoui, an unnamed Saudi prince supported him, and the 19 hijackers who flew planes into buildings on September 11, 2001, while they were training to fly . 'Nothing to do with me': A 2006 video message, above, purportedly from Osama Bin Laden, featured a voice saying Moussaoui was nothing to do with 9/11 . He was in custody on September 11, 2001, and pleaded guilty in April 2005 to conspiring with the hijackers to kill Americans. During his three-year legal fight, Moussaoui repeatedly insulted the judge and tried to fire his lawyers. At one point he was facing the death penalty, which jurors decided against. During the hearing he spontaneously declared that  he had planned to pilot a plane into the White House on September 11. A psychologist called by his lawyers testified that  Moussaoui had paranoid schizophrenia. Moussaoui mocked the testimony, shouting as he left courtroom, 'Crazy or not crazy? That is the question.' In 2006 a recording emerged online of Osama bin Laden distancing himself from Moussaoui. He said: 'He had no connection at all with September 11. I am the one in charge of the 19 brothers, and I never assigned brother Zacarias to be with them in that mission.' Response: The Saudi Arabian government said it had nothing whatsoever to do with the September 11 attacks . Last month, lawyers in a federal lawsuit against Saudi Arabia were permitted to interview Moussaoui in prison. What was said can't be shared publicly until the U.S. government finishes sifting through the transcript to ensure it contains no secret messages that could pose a threat to Americans. Jerry S. Goldman, a lawyer who interviewed him, said: 'I will say that we believe it was relevant and material to our case.' Moussaoui also wrote to the clerk in federal court in Brooklyn in September, saying he had seen a report on Fox News about another suit accusing the Jordan-based Arab Bank of helping finance suicide bombings in Israel. He said he was willing to testify, but the plaintiffs never took it seriously. The communication wasn't relevant to the Arab Bank case and 'don't make clear what his motives are,' said one lawyer, Gary Osen. 'I don't know his state of mind at all.' At Supermax - known as the 'Alcatraz of the Rockies' - Moussaoui is subject to restrictions requiring screening of any attempt to communicate with the outside world. However, there are exceptions for court filings.","Zacarias Moussaoui, 46, filed court documents claiming Saudis funded 9/11 .

"These may look like scenes from a movie set in ancient Rome, but this is actually the Kirkpinar oil wrestling championships in modern-day Turkey. Wearing only leather trousers and smeared with olive oil, these athletes about to competing in the oldest sports competition in the world. The first competition took place near Erdine in 1362, when it was the capital of the Ottoman Empire, with most of the competitors being soldiers. Thousands of fighters gather every year in Erdine, Turkey, to take part in the annual Kirpinar oil wrestling festival which has been taking place since 1362 . Around 1,000 fighters, both boys and men, take part in the competition over three days in 12 categories ranked by height rather than weight . Bouts used to last for days before being decided, but are now limited to 40 minutes with 15 minutes of overtime if a winner is still to be decided . In Kirkpinar a fight is won when one competitor lifts another above his head, or pins the other man to the floor, or when one of the wrestlers collapses . Today both boys and men of any nationality are allowed to take part in the annual competition, and are trained in the art of oil wrestling by a master - much like martial artists in Asia. The fighters - or Pehlivan as they are known - as supposed to uphold the best of Turkish values, symbolising generosity, honesty, respectfulness and adherence to traditions and customs. While oil wrestling existed as far back as the ancient Egyptians, Kirkpinar is the oldest sanctioned competition still to be running - and holds the Guinness World Record for the longest running sporting event. Kirkpinar wrestlers, or Pehlivan as they are known, train for years for the event under a master - similar to martial artists in Asia . Fighters are allowed to keep the golden belt permanently only if they win three events in a row, which is rare. The last time it happened was 16 years ago . Matches happen simultaneously in a giant grass arena outside of Erdine, the Sarayiçi Stadium, where the competition has been held for centuries . Both boys and men are allowed to compete for the event's prize, the golden belt, which they then get to keep until the following year . The festival begins as the golden belt, . the prize for the winner, is paraded through the town to the Selimiye . Mosque where prayers are said before it is taken to Mens Field for the . competition. Thousands of wrestlers, or Pehlivan, don traditional kispet trousers, made of either water buffalo or cow leather, before the master of ceremonies announces their names and talents, all in verse. The men then compete in 12 different categories, classed by height rather than by weight, across three days in order to be named Chief Pehlivan. Before each bout the men smear themselves with olive oil with hundreds of barrels of the slippery liquid being used during the festivities . The men compete nude except for a traditional kispet trousers - leather garments that used to be made from water buffalo but these days they are more commonly made from cow leather . Each of the wrestlers are introduced by the master of ceremonies who recites their names and abilities in verse before the competition begins . Kirkpinar, first fought in 1362, holds the record for the longest running sports competition in the world (pictured, a fighter washes himself down after a bout) Matches are held simultaneously on the . open grassy field of Sarayiçi Stadium. The islet of Sarayiçi, which . translates to 'Inner Palace,' used to be the Sultan's summer palace and . was once the private hunting reserve of the Ottoman sultans. A bout is decided when a fighter either . manages to pin another man to the ground, or manages to lift them up . over their shoulders, or when one of the fighters collapses. While fights could previously go on for days until a winner was decided, there is now a 40-minute time limit, with a winner determined by 15 minutes of overtime if there is no clear victor in that time. Around 1,000 fighters of all ages, nationalities and builds take part in the competition to be named Chief Pehlivan . Boys to men: A group of young oil wrestlers watch their fellow competitors fight from behind a wire fence in Turkey . Getting clean: Some of the youngest competitors take a shower to wash off the olive oil poured over them during wrestling matches in Turkey . Man's game: Fighters are allowed to join the wrestling at a young age, with categories ranked on height. They are then trained by a master to improve their wrestling skills . The winner . is awarded the golden belt which they get to keep until the following . year when it is passed over to the next champion. A . wrestler who manages to retain the title can keep the belt permanently, . with another one made for the following year, but this is extremely . rare. The last fighter to keep a belt was Ahmet Tasci, who won his final . competition 16 years ago.

"From being forced to dress in skimpy clothing to putting up with inappropriate behavior, a new report has lifted the lid on the 'rampant sexual harassment' of the American restaurant industry. A staggering 90 per cent of female restaurant workers say they have been sexually harassed by customers, co-workers and management in the workplace, according to the published document. This includes being sexually teased, pressured to date, inappropriately touched, shown sexually suggestive photos and receiving letters, calls or texts of a sexual nature. Shocking: A new report has lifted the lid on the rampant sexual harassment of the U.S. restaurant industry. Above, 60 per cent of female workers reported that  harassment was an uncomfortable aspect of  life . It also includes being ordered by restaurant bosses to flirt with guests, expose body parts or dress in a particular manner, such as 'wearing tighter clothing or make-up to look more sexy'. Researchers found tipped employees put up with the unwanted behavior because they depend on customers' tips to boost their minimum wage of $2.13 per hour. This wage, which is more than $5 lower than the federal minimum of $7.25 an hour, has remained unchanged since 1991. The 'endemic' sexual harassment of restaurant workers was unveiled by Restaurant Opportunities Center (ROC) United, which interviewed employees from across 36 states. According to the 34-page document, named 'The Glass Floor: Sexual Harassment in the Restaurant Industry', women make up two-thirds (66 per cent) of all tipped restaurant employees. Alarmingly, 60 per cent of female workers reported that sexual harassment, such as groping, was an uncomfortable - and regular - aspect of working life. Figures: Half of female restaruant workers claimed they had experienced 'scary or unwanted' behavior in the workplace, with one third experiencing harassment from customers (pictured) on at least a weekly basis . 'Uncomfortable': Forms of sexual harassment in restaurants include being sexually teased, pressurized to date, inappropriately touched and receiving calls or texts of a sexual nature, the report said (file picture) Half claimed they had experienced 'scary or unwanted' behavior from customers, colleagues and their bosses, with one third experiencing harassment from customers on at least a weekly basis. 'Since women restaurant workers living off tips are forced to rely on customers for their income rather than their employer, these workers must often tolerate inappropriate behavior from customers, co-workers, and management,' the report said. 'This dynamic contributes to the restaurant industry's status as the single largest source of sexual harassment claims in the U.S.' Male restaurant workers also reported high levels of sexual harassment in the workplace, with more than 50 per cent admitting receiving sexual comments, remarks or teasing. Contrast: These figures show differences in customer behavior, experienced by male and female workers . Nearly 40 per cent said they had received inappropriate comments about their sexual orientation, while 55 percent claimed customers had sexually harassed them. The shocking figures may account for why around 37 percent of all sexual harassment claims filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission stem from the restaurant industry. Saru Jayaraman, co-director and co-founder of the non-profit restaurant worker's group, RA, told USA Today: 'We need to eliminate the sub-minimum wage for tipped workers in the United States.' She added that tipped workers are wrongly being 'forced to dress and act in certain ways that make them vulnerable to customer, co-worker and manager harassment.' Management behavior: These figures,  relating to management behavior, reveal that 20 per cent of  female workers have been told to alter their appearance beyond the restaurant's dress code by those above them . A 'sexier' look: Researchers found tipped employees put up with the unwanted behavior because they depend on customers' tips to boost their minimum wage of $2.13 per hour. Above, a scantily-clad RollerGirl waitress takes orders in a beer garden in Minnesota (left), while a waitress stands at a Red Bull tent in 2004 (right) The report, compiled in cooperation with nearly a dozen women's and workers' rights groups, comes as low-wage restaurant workers increasingly push for better pay and improved rights. The National Restaurant Association (NRA) dismissed the report, saying that it 'takes charges of sexual harassment very seriously' and 'no individual is making $2.13 an hour'. It told CBC MoneyWatch: 'The assertion from ROC that the tipped wage somehow increases sexual harassment by customers is another effort to confuse the reality of the tipped wage in the industry. 'We take pride in the fact that more women own, operate and manage restaurants than virtually any other industry.'","90% of female restaurant workers say they have been sexually harassed .

"A Republican congressman known as a pit bull in Washington said Thursday that he doesn't support the idea of impeachment proceedings against President Obama  because winning that fight would elevate the vice president to the Oval Office. 'Have you met Joe Biden?' South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy asked during a Fox News Channel interview. Impeachment talk has swirled around Washington since the president announced that an executive order overhauling America's immigration system is imminent. But some in the GOP see Biden as Obama's hedge against removal from office, since much of his public exposure has come in conjunction with a series of embarrassing gaffes. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . 'Have you met Joe Biden?' – South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy created a memorable one-liner on Thursday by explaining why Republicans can't impeach President Barack Obama . Just Joe being Joe: Vice President Biden has a reputation as a one-man gaffe machine, making some Republicans see him as 'Obama's insurance policy' against impeachment . A senior aide to a House Republican told MailOnline on Friday that 'Avoiding the ""I"" word' is a case of 'better the devil you know than the devil you don't.' 'Only in this case, we're pretty sure we know both devils. And Biden – he's two floppy shoes short of a complete clown outfit. Let's be honest: He's Obama's insurance policy.' Impeachment is a process that begins in the House of Representatives with a list of charges that must fit what the U.S. Constitution calls 'high crimes and misdemeanors' – with 'high' referring to the level of the president's office, not the seriousness of the offenses. A supermajority of two-thirds of U.S. senators are required to convict America's chief executive after a trial. President Bill Clinton survived an impeachment after Senate Democrats remained unanimous in acquitting him. Richard Nixon resigned his office as a groundswell of support formed in Congress for impeachment proceedings following the Watergate scandal. Obama appears safe, even with Republicans holding 54 or 55 of the upper chamber's 100 seats next year. And besides, there's the Biden factor. In a speech this year, this vice president told a gathering of African leaders that Africa was a country, not a continent. It brought back memories of a 2008 photo-op outside Biden's home where he told journalists that he had just returned from 'a successful dump,' which turned out to be a trip to a nearby landfill. In 2010 he had a diplomatic face-palm moment by consoling Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen on the loss of his mother – who was very much alive. In 2012 he made the sign of the cross while on stage to address a group of more than 1,600 Jewish rabbis. Reporters guffawed later that year when he tried to capture the spirit of President Theodore Roosevelt's famous 'Speak softly' philosophy, by noting that 'the president has a big stick. I promise you.' During a campaign speech during his first vice presidential run, he criticized then-GOP candidate Sen. John McCain for what he called a 'last-minute economic plan' that did 'nothing to tackle the number-one job facing the middle class.' 'It happens to be, as Barack says, a three-letter word: jobs. J-O-B-S, jobs.' Gowdy, a former criminal prosecutor, chairs the special House committee looking into the 2012 terror attacks in Benghazi, Libya. He is also chairman of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security . He hinted Thursday on Fox News that because Biden would be a global laughingstock, the idea of trying to kick Obama out of office is far out on Capitol Hill's fringes. 'Nobody's discussing impeachment except pundits and commentators,' he said. 'First of all, impeachment is a punishment. It's not a remedy. Second of all, the only people who want us to talk about impeachment are the president's allies.' Fox host Bill O'Reilly had asked whether Obama's threatened immigration executive order would be reason enough for the GOP to try to remove him from office . Biden, seen Friday at the Inter-American Development Bank in Washington, DC, has made no secret of his leaning toward a 2016 presidential run . Fox host Bill O'Reilly had challenged him, citing an analysis by former New Jersey Superior Court Judge Andrew Napolitano, who is now a Fox News analyst. An Obama-initiated move to give legal status to millions of illegal immigrants, O'Reilly said, paraphrasing Napolitano, 'is an impeachable situation because it does go against Congress making the laws, because the president is making a new law.' 'And the new law says that if you have children who are American citizens even though you yourself are an illegal undocumented person, you can stay in this country. That supersedes the old law. Napolitano claims it’s unconstitutional and impeachable.' With that bait dangling, a few Republicans have broached the subject, including Texas Rep. Joe Barton. 'Impeachment is indicting in the House and that’s a possibility,' Barton said Monday on Newsmax TV. 'But you still have to convict in the Senate and that takes a two-thirds vote. 'But impeachment would be a consideration. Yes sir.' Gowdy, however, said he can resist the same bait. 'I'm not going to take it because I've met Joe Biden,' he explained. 'That's not the answer. ... He could be the new president!'","Trey Gowdy said his party can't impeach the president over his threatened immigration overhaul – but only because Biden would become president .

"Sales of leading brands of extra virgin olive oil have plummeted in the wake of a hefty hike in prices, a new report showed yesterday. For the average price of branded olive oil has shot up 16.4 per cent to £5.19 a litre over the course of the past year and the increase has taken its toll on sales to supermarket shoppers, according to the latest research. While overall sales of extra virgin olive oil have risen 4.7 per cent in volume and 12.5 per cent in value, branded volumes have slumped 11.7 per cent and the 2.8 per cent rise in value is almost entirely attributable to price inflation, data from market analysts Kantar Worldpanel shows. Among the . best-selling olive oil brands, the worst hit in the last year was Napolina followed by Don Mario and then Filippo Berio (pictured) Trade magazine The Grocer said yesterday: ‘There is a limit to how much Brits will pay for quality and it seems some of Britain's biggest extra virgin olive oil brands have hit it. The report says that, own label products, on the other hand, have kept a lid on inflation. The upshot is that the difference between own label and brands has widened from 19.1 per cent to 28.7 per cent and own-label sales have soared 25.8 per cent in value on volumes up 22.8 per cent. Among the best-selling olive oil brands, the worst hit in the last year was Napolina with volume sales down 31.9 per cent followed by Don Mario which was down 28.9 per cent and Filippo Berio down 7.1 per cent. The Grocer said that reduced deal activity from the brands has not helped but they have lost out to other premium oil brands, notably rapeseed. The report says that extra virgin olive oil brands are still reeling from the after-effects of prolonged drought in Spain which decimated the country's 2012/13 olive harvest, slashing production from 1.6 million tonnes in the previous season to just 616,300 tonnes. Factory gate prices surged by more than 40 per cent in some cases as supplies were squeezed, said Walter Zanre, managing director of Filippo Berio UK. ‘People were scrambling around for oil towards the end of the season and the accessibility of raw materials was very tight,’ he told the magazine. Mr Zanre says he sees no imminent end to the sky-high prices despite the recent Spanish harvest being up 150 per cent on last year's to an estimated 1.5 million tonnes. He says there is no reason for prices to fall and the industry needs another good year to make up for the shortfall. The report says that although cost hikes affect brands and own label alike, until now only the brands have passed on the increases and this has resulted in a significant price discrepancy between branded and own label. The Grocer said: ‘With raw material costs likely to stay high, how long suppliers will be able to keep a lid on own label extra virgin olive oil costs – up just 2½ per cent in the past year – is now in question. And if the difference between own label and branded prices begins to narrow again, brands could claw back some of the lost share over the coming year.’","Overall sales of extra virgin olive oil .

"Football Association chairman Greg Dyke will push for trials of video replays to help referees this week when the game's law-makers meet in Belfast. The International FA Board (IFAB) will hear details of a trial by the Dutch FA (KNVB) where a video assistant watches a match on television and liaises with the referee via a headset. The KNVB wants permission to trial the system live in Holland's main cup competition and officials were presenting their findings to the FA on Wednesday. Dyke is expected to give his support at the meeting of IFAB, which is made up of FIFA and the four home nations. FA Chairman Greg Dyke (left) poses with England manager Roy Hodgson and the FA Cup trophy . Dyke told Press Association Sport: 'I believe we will look back in 20 years' time and say, ""Wasn't it quaint that we didn't use the available technology to help referees"". 'I think the referees themselves are now up for trying it out somewhere. Slowly and gradually it needs to be done, as you could disrupt the game completely if you are not careful. 'The Dutch also say they have something which can tell you offsides instantly which could be useful. 'I hope it will be agreed that we can have a big trial of it somewhere - but we won't put forward the Premier League.' FIFA president Sepp Blatter announced a U-turn on video replays last year when suggesting each manager should be allowed two 'challenges' on controversial decisions, but that idea has received little support. Referee Martin Atkinson sending Nemanja Matic off during Chelsea's 1-1 draw with Burnley on Saturday . Scottish FA chief executive Stewart Regan was shown a presentation by the Dutch FA on Tuesday and said he was encouraged the system used existing technology and potentially did not interfere with the flow of the game in the way that the video referee can do in rugby. Regan said: 'We would want to avoid referees relying on it for every incident and potentially slowing the game down and stopping it, we are very keen to keep the game at the same tempo. 'We remain open-minded. The Dutch would like to go live with a test and we will discuss this at the IFAB.' The KNVB said findings to date suggested an average of two or three crucial incidents per game are suitable for video referral, with decisions typically possible in a time-frame of five to 20 seconds. Southampton were denied a penalty on Sunday despite Liverpool's Joe Allen seemingly fouling Filip Djuricic . KNVB spokesman Koen Adriaanse told Press Association Sport: 'We are supporters of technology to assist referees in the decision-making process and our first experiences are positive. We believe that a video assistant can support a referee in order to make more correct decisions. 'It is only for us in decisive situations - penalties, fouls before goals, red cards - and it is not only there to show wrong decisions, but also to support the referee in decisions that are right.' A survey this week saw overwhelming public support for video replays to be used in Premier League football. The Usurv poll of 1,000 people for the Press Association found 73 per cent in favour and 27 per cent against.","FA chairman Greg Dyke will push for trials of video replays for referees .

"Prosecutors have detained the head of the South Korean company that owns the ferry that sank killing 300 people last month over an allegation of cargo overloading. Authorities believe improper stowage and overloading of cargo are one possible reason why the Sewol ferry sank on April 16. Four employees at the ferry's owner Chonghaejin Marine Co who handled cargo on the vessel, have already been arrested.

Kim Han-sik, president of Chonghaejin, was detained ahead of his possible formal arrest on allegations that he was aware that the ferry exceeded its cargo limit but did not do anything before it started its trip, according to senior prosecutor Yang Jung-jin. Mr Yang said prosecutors are investigating Kim's actions before deciding if they will request a court to issue a warrant to formally arrest him.

The news comes as the first picture has been released of a civilian diver, who died while trying to recover bodies trapped in the wreckage of the Sewol. Lee Kwang-wook died in hospital on Tuesday after becoming unconscious following searches off the southern coast of South Korea, where the Sewol sank. Some task force team officials say the 53-year-old diver was pulled to the surface by fellow divers after losing communication. Searches for bodies have been hampered by strong currents and floating debris inside the ship. Yesterday, the South Korean Prime Minister called for underwater searches to be completed by the weekend.

Chung Hong-won told a cabinet council meeting that workers must ‘resolve to finish searches’ by Saturday as tidal currents are forecast to be weak until then. The lengthy, difficult underwater search for bodies off South Korea's southern coast has deepened the anguish of families of missing people, who have been camping out at a nearby port waiting for the news of their loved ones. Many South Koreans have been highly critical of the government's handling of the rescue effort, and the regulatory failures that may have allowed the disaster to happen. On Wednesday, the government announced it miscounted the number of survivors, the latest in a series of errors that have eroded the nation's confidence in its leaders. Coastguard chief Kim Suk-kyoon said 172 people survived the sinking of the ferry Sewol - not 174, as the government had been saying since April 18. The slow searches have deepened the anguish of families of missing people, who have been camping out at a nearby port waiting for the news . Mr Kim said one of the survivors was accidentally listed twice, and he blamed the other mistake on an inaccurate report by a passenger. He added there are two more missing passengers than authorities previously knew about. Both are Chinese nationals. That change raises the number of people feared dead to 304. More than 80% of them are students from a single high school near Seoul who were on a trip to southern Jeju island. There is evidence not only that the ship was overloaded with cargo, but that the agency responsible for ensuring passenger safety had incorrect information about how much the ship could safely carry.","Kim Han-sik detained by prosecutors over allegation he knew cargo was overloaded .
