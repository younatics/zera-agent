Uganda’s president yesterday described gay people as ‘unnatural’ and ‘disgusting’ after signing a controversial bill that punishes homosexual sex with up to life in prison. Yoweri Museveni said the bill, which goes into effect immediately, was needed because the West is promoting homosexuality in Africa. It is a measure likely to send Uganda's beleaguered gay community further underground as the police try to implement it amid fevered anti-homosexual sentiment across the country. Scroll down for video . Controversial: Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni signs the anti-gay legislation in Kampala, Uganda . Arms raised: Ugandan pupils from different schools take part in an event organised by Christians to celebrate the signing of a new anti-gay bill that sets high penalties for homosexual sex . He told CNN: 'They're disgusting. What sort of people are they? I never knew what they were doing. ‘I've . been told recently that what they do is terrible. Disgusting. But I was . ready to ignore that if there was proof that that's how he is born, . abnormal. But now the proof is not there.' Scientists . had written a report which found there is no proven genetic basis for . homosexuality, Mr Museveni said, citing it as a reason for signing the . bill. He added: ‘I was . regarding it as an inborn problem. Genetic distortion - that was my . argument. But now our scientists have knocked this one out.’ Celebration: Supporters hold banners after Mr Museveni signed the anti-gay law, defying protests from rights groups, criticism from Western donors and a US warning that it will complicate relations . Anger: Gay and lesbian people and others supporting their cause wear masks as they stage a rare protest, against Uganda's increasingly stance against homosexuality, outside the Uganda High Commission in Nairobi . Mr Museveni may have defied Western . pressure to shelve the bill, four years and many versions after it was . introduced, but his move pleased many Ugandans who repeatedly urged him . to sign it. 'They're disgusting. What sort of people are they? I never knew what they were doing. I've been told recently that what they do is terrible. Disgusting' Yoweri Museveni, Ugandan President . Nigeria's . president similarly signed an anti-gay bill into law just over a month . ago, sparking increased violence against gays who already were . persecuted in mob attacks. Some watchdog groups warn a similar . backlash of violence may occur in Uganda - where support is now likely . to be galvanized for Mr Museveni ahead of presidential elections. ‘Experience . from other jurisdictions with similarly draconian laws, such as Nigeria . or Russia, indicates that their implementation is often followed by a . surge in violence against individuals thought to be lesbian, gay, . bisexual or transgender,’ an International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights . Commission spokesman said. CNN interview: Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni described gay people as 'unnatural' and 'disgusting' President Yoweri Museveni's bill is popular in Uganda, a country where homosexuality is already illegal . ‘The Ugandan government has not indicated any plans to counter such violence or to investigate potential allegations of abuse.’ The Ugandan law calls for first-time offenders to be sentenced to 14 years in jail. It . sets life imprisonment as the maximum penalty for ‘aggravated . homosexuality,’ defined as repeated gay sex between consenting adults . and acts involving a minor, a disabled person or where one partner is . infected with HIV. Uganda's new anti-gay law has been condemned around the world. In . Washington, White House press secretary Jay Carney called the law . ‘abhorrent,’ urged its repeal and said the White House is reviewing its . relationship with Uganda. 'The president is making this decision because he has never met an openly gay person. That disappoints me' Pepe Julian Onziema, Ugandan gay activist . United . Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay warned that the . law would institutionalise discrimination and could encourage harassment . and violence against gays.

Museveni accused ‘arrogant and careless Western groups’ of trying to . recruit Ugandan children into homosexuality, but he did not name these . purported groups. Mr .

"By . Alice Smellie . PUBLISHED: . 10:45 EST, 25 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 12:07 EST, 25 February 2014 . Clutching my tiny two week old son to my somewhat frazzled body I let my mother into a secret. ‘To be honest, he hasn't left the house yet,’ I whispered, revealing that two week old Archie was as cosseted as a young prince. Not only was I exhausted, but I was terrified of venturing outside in case we forgot some vital piece of equipment. What if I found myself in an embarrassing explosive nappy changing emergency? What if he got hungry and I had nowhere and nothing to feed him? The reality, to put this into perspective, was that we lived in Central London, never further than 100 metres from a supermarket and I was breast feeding so frankly, all would be fine. Plus we had a top of the range Bugaboo pushchair for for safe and easy travel. Scroll down for video . Simon Cowell (right) and girlfriend Lauren Silverman (left) took their newborn son Eric onto the beach just ten days after his birth . Alice Smellie points out that the beach  is extremely unhygienic as seen when Simon Cowell's dog licked baby Eric's face (pictured). Any crisis could be resolved by leaping into a black cab and hot-footing it back to Fulham. But no modern day high tech equipment would have ever made me want to hit the beach two weeks post birth. I can't think of anything worse. I could barely get ready for bed, never mind anything else. Mum of three Alice Smellie says she can imagine nothing worse than going on a beach holiday two weeks after giving birth . So, as you can imagine, I was astonished to see young Eric Cowell’s launch into society taking place on a balmy beach just ten days after his birth. I would rather have travelled on the first manned flight to Mars than take a newborn to a sand-infested boiling hot beach. Let me tell you about tiny babies and beaches. Firstly - and I realise that this is obvious, but it appears that Eric’s parents may have forgotten - beaches are full of that irritating stuff known as sand. Get that into a nappy and you are potentially looking at nappy rash and therefore an unhappy and wide-awake baby who requires a nappy change. It goes without saying that changing a nappy on a beach is inevitably going to involve, yes you guessed it, more sand. We all know it gets everyhwhere so you can forget any thoughts of cleaning that baby's bum properly because wipes are sand magnets. The slightest breeze - and by this I mean the sort of breeze that might lightly flutter the hem of Lauren’s kaftan - will have sand sticking to the baby wipe, and thus to the bottom of young Cowell. Alice Smellie points out the huge impracticality of having to carry at least ten sterilised bottles to the beach . Alice Smellie says that most normal mothers wouldn't be able to carry all the equipment needed for the beach . Next, there is the kit. Breast . feeding or not, new babies need approximately twelve suitcases of . baggage - nappies changes of clothes, toys (no new parent, myself . included, has even acknowledged that the two day old is not going to . appreciate teddy bears, even if they come from Harrods). So it isn’t . surprising that Simon and Lauren need what looks like five or six nannies. 'It goes without saying that changing a . nappy on a beach is inevitably going to involve some sort of sand/baby . wipe interaction. Baby wipes have their uses, but they also act as sand . magnets' As Lauren Silverman appears not to be breast-feeding, she will need about ten sterilised bottles. Minimum. And should one touch anything a bit dirty (e.g. a dog's tongue!) it will be totally redundant. Finally, but most importantly, there is the Florida sun, which is presumably both hot and powerful. Although the newborn has mostly been photographed under an assortment of white billowing tents, it seems extraordinary that they wouldn’t just keep him inside and away from any risk of over-heating or sunstroke. Lauren Silverman avoids giving her baby dreaded sunstroke by sheltering in a large white tent . We didn’t take baby Archie to a beach until he was eight months old. I remember the special sun-tent, the twenty sorts of hypo-allergenic sun cream, the baby food spilling in the bottom of the Cath Kidston rucksack and the hissed and irritable mewling which accompanies all normal babies in transit. I can't help thinking, looking at all the photos that Lauren Silverman isn't always enjoying herself at the beach with her baby. She looks - as a friend of mine has pointed out - a bit cross. I think this might be like calling Cowell a ‘bit rich.’ In a couple of the pictures her lips look pursed as though she wants to tell someone to just leave her alone. Simon Cowell was seen with an entourage of young female fans on baby Eric's first outing to the beach . Alice Smellie says that most new mothers don't want to be seen in public for a while after birth - especially if their partners are surrounded by young female fans eager to flirt . Most new mothers don’t want to be seen in public for at least a week. Frankly, I think she must have the patience of a saint to be trekking on hot sand clutching a days old baby in on-trend beachwear. One is at this point - to be delicate about the situation - recovering physically from the trauma of giving birth. So a short kaftan is beyond impractical. Generally, even if you have maintained your pre-pregnancy figure as amazingly as Silverman, you feel a bit fat. A baby has just emerged from your tummy and it inevitably takes at least a few weeks to lose the extra pounds. Alice says that recently giving birth and a short kaftan don't go hand in hand . So the last thing you want is to be seen half-naked (by everybody in the developed world), especially as your partner is being heavily flirted with by any number of toned hotties with good plastic surgery and small bikinis. Most women during that first week get a bit weepy as the body undergoes extreme hormonal changes. Again - taking the infant onto a beach with fifty staff and close friends is the last thing you feel like doing. You want to be slumped in a chair with day-time telly, comfy pyjamas and your husband and relatives dancing close attendance. (This is what I did with every one of my three babies). Most mothers might burst into tears, shove the baby at Cowell screaming, ‘he’s your responsibility too,’ and storm off back to the five star hotel. And most fathers would probably take it on the chin. I watch with interest…..","Writer Alice Smellie was shocked to see Lauren Silverman and baby Eric  on the beach .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 12:00 EST, 25 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 21:55 EST, 25 February 2014 . A day after arguing for deep budget cuts to America's military, the Obama administration has told the Defense Department to prepare for a 100 per cent withdrawal from Afghanistan. Obama has made clear his desire to draw down troops from the war-torn nation by year's end, but Tuesday marked the first time a scenario has been discussed publicly that would completely void Afghanistan of U.S. personnel who have been vital in fighting Taliban militias. 'President Obama has asked the Pentagon to ensure that it has adequate plans in place to accomplish an orderly withdrawal by the end of the year should the United States not keep any troops in Afghanistan after 2014,' the White House said Tuesday morning. That message was part of a phone call between Obama and Afghan leader Hamid Karzai on Tuesday, during which the U.S. president reportedly pressured him to accept the terms of a Bilateral Security Agreement (BSA) that has been pending for months. The Obama administration has made the agreement, drafted in November, a requirement if it is to leave a counter-terrorism force in Karzai's country after the larger U.S. pullout is complete. Scroll Down for Video . Barack Obama may be playing a game of chicken with Hamid Karzai, designed to force the Afghan leader's hand before he passes off power later this year . Taliban insurgents continue to rain destruction on Afghanistan's cities and villages, continuing the West's quest to deploy just the right amount of muscle in response . Sad sack? Pentagon chief Chuck Hagel had to tell reporters on Monday that U.S. military strength would be pared back to ts levels in 1940 . Karzai has been putting off the decision to sign the BSA, saying that it should be left for his successor. Elections will be held in April to choose the next president. But that process could drag on for months since Afghanistan's presidential election process is a two-stage system that may not be complete until July or August. A Defense Department source told MailOnline that existing Pentagon plans call for as many as 10,000 troops to remain behind, split between training forces and special operators equipped to raid Taliban strongholds. But those plans are fluid. And since so many NATO allies in Afghanistan depend on U.S. troops for logistical support and just-in-time war materiel, those world powers are finding it hard to plan without a clear nod from the Americans. And Obama's decision is already limiting the choices of a NATO panel of defense ministers meeting this week in Brussels, Belgium. The NATO group is weighing how many troops to place in Afghanistan next year, and the political tug-of-war between Washington and Kabul promises to wreak havoc with those plans. If Karzai's successor isn't in place until the end of the summer, the Pentagon source cautioned, NATO will find itself in a time crunch with just months or weeks left to finalize deployment decisions. Afghan President Hamid Karzai wants to pass the decision about an American security agreement to his successor, but that may leave a US-dependent NATO with too little time to plan its 2015 deployments . U.S. troops are a common sight -- for now -- in Kabul, where at least one person was killed and four others were wounded during a bombing . Most . of the major-party contenders for the Afghan presidency have spoken in . favor of the U.S. agreement, but NATO generals and the Pentagon don't . want to premise billions of dollars in logistical moves on the uncertain . outcome of a Middle Eastern election. 'We will leave open the possibility of concluding a BSA with Afghanistan later this year,' the White House said Tuesday. Ouch: Former Vice President Dick Cheney said Tuesday that President Obama would rather spend federal dollars on food stamps than on a strong military . 'However, . the longer we go without a BSA, the more challenging it will be to plan . and execute any U.S. mission. Furthermore, the longer we go without a . BSA, the more likely it will be that any post-2014 U.S. mission will be . smaller in scale and ambition.' Karzai has been cantankerous and his commitments have become more elusive as the U.S. has withdrawn platoon after platoon. But the Pentagon knows that he can't run for the top post again. His war of words with Obama may be a case of one lame duck speaking to another – the worst circumstance for Obama's latest move if it's just an Oval Office bluff. The Defense Department, however, insists that the president may actually order a complete withdrawal after the NATO meeting in Belgium, where Secretary of State Chuck Hagel will represent U.S. interests. 'Without question, the issues surrounding the future of the Afghan mission will certainly be discussed in Brussels, to include the challenges of retrograde and force posture faced by all Allies,' Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told The Guardian. 'We long said that we would like a BSA as soon as possible.

Dozens of Royal fans turned up at an Asda after hearing the future King was opening the store - only to find a baker named Prince Charles cutting the ribbon instead. Eager shoppers gathered outside the supermarket in Arnold, Nottingham, yesterday after rumours circulated of a Royal visitor. But they were disappointed when the guest of honour turned out to be a 55-year-old Asda worker named Prince Charles. Regal name: Baker Prince Charles who cut the ribbon for an Asda store in Nottingham. Royalists who turned up were expecting the future king . Prince Charles, whose middle name is Rafael, got to cut the ribbon to unveil the new-look store as he has worked for the company for 25 years. But onlookers who were expecting to see the heir to the throne said they felt duped. Pensioner Gladys Mortimer, 78, said: 'We thought it would be a bit odd if he opened a supermarket but we thought it could be real so came down to take a look. 'It's a shame really and I feel sorry for him that his parents gave him that name - it's a bit cruel and I bet he's had a bit of stick over the years. 'It was a bit of an anti-climax though.' Two princes: The 55-year-old Asda worker  cut the ribbon at the official ceremony to celebrate the refurbished store in Arnold, Nottingham.

Royalist Don Barton, 80, added: 'Everybody had been saying he was coming - but it turns out it was just a cheap stunt to get them some publicity. 'I've travelled 10 miles to be here and I feel duped.' Prince Charles wore a grey suit over his white bakery overalls and even had a gold crown on his head. Speaking after the ceremony, the dad-of-five said being named after the successor to the throne meant people always put the phone down on him. He joked: 'It was an honour to open the store, I enjoyed it and it has made my day. 'When I phone people up and I say my name is Prince Charles they say 'yeah you are joking' and they put the phone down. The father-of-five is a long-serving member of staff and was honoured by his colleagues . 'I try again and they say okay and put the phone down again. 'When I go to the bank or anywhere else I have to show my driving licence or my passport all the time. 'I would love to meet the real Prince Charles and tell him how much trouble his name has caused me but in a funny way.'

'I would love to meet the real Prince Charles and tell him how much trouble his name has caused me but in a funny way' Store manager Rebecca Portess today said she chose the bakery worker to cut the ribbon because he was the longest serving member of staff.

'Once we realised people had picked up on his name, we thought we would have a bit of fun with it and got a crown.'","Prince Rafael Charles, 55, opened a supermarket in Nottingham yesterday .

A 19-year-old who brutally beat up a 70-year-old man in Portland, Oregon while high on drugs refused to apologize to the victim today as he was sentenced to five years in prison. Daniel Dorson, then 18, smashed his skateboard over Larry Allen's head when the senior citizen asked him and a group of street youth to move away from the Portland Outdoor Store, where he has worked for the past 30 years. Public defender Chris Howard made a deal with prosecutor Chris Mascal, agreeing that if Dorson plead guilty to attempted second-degree assault, he would get a five-year sentence with the possibility of early release. Not sorry: Daniel Dorson, 19, refused to apologize for beating a 70-year-old man as he was sentenced to five years in prison in connection to the July attack today . Beaten and bruised: Larry Allen had to take three weeks off work following the attack, which left him with a huge gash on his head, several scratches and cuts on his arm and lasting health problems . This was a preferable sentence to the mandatory five-year and 10-month sentence Dorson would have received if convicted of second-degree assault. But the plea deal was almost pulled when Dorson refused to apologize to Allen in court today. 'What I'm guilty of is defending my own. That's it. That's all I have to say. I was defending my own,' Dorson said. That wasn't good enough for Mascal. 'I'm not satisfied by the so-called apology,' Mascal told the judge. 'I think it falls short...I think (the victim) is owed a little bit more.' The judge then cleared the court so Howard could speak to his client, but by the time the break was over Dorson still refused to apologize. In the end, Mascal decided to go through with the plea deal anyway 'for the good of the case'. After the hearing, Allen spoke with reporters about seeing his attacker again. 'I recognized him as soon as he walked down the hallway. Kind of nervous being in the same room,' Allen said. 'Just apologize for hitting an old man. There was no need for it.' Allen went out to spray the sidewalks on July 15 when he encountered Dorson with a pack of street youth. Just trying to do his job: Allen was trying to spray the sidewalks outside the Portland Outdoor Store, where he has worked for 30 years, on July 15 when a pack of street youth refused move . He asked the group to move so he could clean the walkway, but when they refused they got into an argument. Dorson says that Allen pushed his girlfriend, which Allen denies. He also claims he was high on drugs and hadn't slept for a few days. Either way, Dorson took his skate board and bashed it over Allen's head, causing the senior citizen to gush blood. A co-worker said Allen passed out for approximately 20 seconds. He also sustained several scratches and cuts on his arm. Allen had to take three weeks off work following the attack and says he's still dealing with the after effects. 'I am not breathing quite as well as I was,' Allen said. 'I'm getting weaker.' Allen spoke with reporters after Tuesday's hearing, saying he was confused why Dorson wouldn't just say sorry . By the time police arrived on the scene the pack of kids were gone. It wasn't until three months later that authorities tracked Dorson down to northern California where he was arrested for second-degree assault. Initially, Dorson claimed he didn't know anything about the attack but then changed his story to say someone else carried it out. Eventually he admitted being the perpetrator, but said he was just trying to protect his girlfriend. During his court appearances, more details emerged about Dorson's childhood and how he ended up on the street. His public defender said he was put in the foster care system as an infant but eventually taken in by his grandmother when he was three. Home life turned bad when a man moved in with them when Dorson was 7, and the drug user beat him up with hangers and brooms. Eventually his grandmother put him back in the foster care system when he was 11, and he became a runaway at 14. That's around the time he found a group of street youth who 'accepted him for who he was'. Allen is back working five days a week at the outdoor store, but says he doesn't spray the sidewalks anymore.","Daniel Dorson, 19, smashed a skateboard over 70-year-old Larry Allen's head during an argument in July .

Wearing make-up to feel more confident and attractive is common practice for Western women. And although they live in a world far removed from urban life, it's the same for women of the Karo tribe in Ethiopia. Using white chalk and red ochre, the women create intricate circle, spiral and cross-hatched designs in order to look more beautiful and stand out of the crowd. What's more, it's not just the women who use this technique in a bid to be more visually appealing to the opposite sex. The men also paint their faces and bodies to boost their sex appeal. Insight: Photographer Vicente Pamparo visited the tribe to capture their way of life on the river bank . Body art: Men, women and children from the Karo in Ethiopia paint their faces and bodies with white chalk . Face mask: The markings are an important part of festivities and ceremonies within the tribe . Sex appeal: For the men, the body paint is meant to make them look more attractive and courageous . Now the beauty of their painted markings has been revealed in a set of incredible photos by American snapper and economics student Vicente Pamparo, who sought out the tribe, who live on the east banks of Ethiopia's Omo River, to capture the splendour of their tribal make-up. Speaking to MailOnline, he explained: 'The Karo is a highly aesthetic group of . people. Their styles are often symbolic of important festivities or as a . means of attracting the opposite sex. 'Their hair is usually mixed with red . ochre and cut in a bowl-like fashion. Walking around the tribe area, . you can't help but notice women lathering goat hide with animal fat to . add to their wardrobe.' But the tribesmen don't just decorate themselves with white markings to attract women. They also do it for a number of other reasons, including to look more intimating to those from rival tribes in the region and as a means of enhancing their status. Vicente explains: 'The Karo men cover their body and face . with white chalk mixed with fat to celebrate important festivities, show . off during guest visits, conflict between other clans or for purely . aesthetic reasons.' Pride: The men carry weapons to guard their cattle from wild animals and other tribes and also to enhance their status . Welcoming: Vicente found the tribe to be welcoming and generous during his stay . Image conscious: The Karo people decorate their face and bodies to celebrate important festivities and for purely aesthetic reasons. They also do piercings and self-inflicted scars as a means of enhancing their appearance . As well as decorating themselves in the white markings, the men will also inflict lacerations and cuts on themselves to produce scars and markings. These are highly esteemed because they represent courageous acts. 'Scarification, whether natural or self-inflicted, symbolises courage or an appeal to the opposite sex,' he added. 'Children will also wear body paint when taking part in festivities and as a means of identifying themselves as part of the clan.' The Karo tribe is made up of about 1,000 people who survive on agriculture and fishing. Their diet consists of maize, sorghum and beans they grow themselves plus they fish from the river and raise goats and cattle. Most of the men carry weapons which Vicente said is necessary to protect . their cattle from other tribes and wild animals. But he added: 'It also symbolises their pride, as . weapons allows for the protection of not only the individuals but also . their tribe.' Primative living: The tribe of about 1,000 people survive on agriculture and fishing and raise their own goats . Despite their intimidating, ghostly appearance thanks to their guns and war paint, Vicente said the tribe were 'pleasant and friendly' when he visited last November to learn about them and their way of life. He said: 'I managed to receive permission to set up a tent within the tribe area and the Karo's hospitality was unwavering. I was invited to drink coffee with several of the families, fished with some of the men, guarded the farms against baboons. I also drank some ""akele"" which is an alcoholic beverage enjoyed during celebrations. Their token of friendship was remarkable.'

Egypt's military-backed government has stepped down today in a shock move just eight months after seizing power. Interim prime minister Hazem el-Beblawi announced the resignation of his Cabinet this morning, paving the way for the nation's military chief to leave his defense minister's post to run for president. El-Beblawi's military-backed government was sworn in on July 16, less than two weeks after Field Marsh Abdel-Fettah el-Sissi, the defense minister, ousted Islamist President Mohammed Morsi after a year in office. Egyptian interim Prime Minister Hazem el-Beblawi announced the resignation of his Cabinet today . The government's resignation, . announced by el-Beblawi in a live TV broadcast, came amid a host of . strikes, including one by public transport workers and garbage . collectors. An acute shortage of cooking gas has also been making front page news the past few days. It was not immediately clear whether el-Beblawi will stay at the helm of a new government or will step aside for a new prime minister. El-Beblawi has often been derided in the media for his perceived indecisiveness and inability to introduce effective remedies to the country's economic woes. He has also been criticized for the security forces' inability to prevent high-profile terror attacks blamed on militants sympathetic with Morsi and his Muslim Brotherhood. The outgoing prime minister acknowledged the difficult conditions in which his Cabinet functioned, but suggested that Egypt was in a better place now that it was when he first took office.

'The Cabinet has over the past six or . seven months shouldered a very difficult and delicate responsibility and . I believe that, in most cases, it achieved good results,' el-Beblawi . said. The goal, he added, was to take Egypt out of a 'narrow tunnel' brought about by security, political and economic pressures. Commenting on the flurry of strikes, . the outgoing prime minister cautioned Egyptians that this was not the . time for making demands.

House Speaker John Boehner already has the right tan for Florida's beaches, but he insists he's not headed south to retire any time soon. The Ohio Republican laughed off the idea on Wednesday when a scrum of reporters cornered him in the speaker's lobby hear the House floor, chuckling 'Ha, ha, ha.' Minutes later, he told The Washington Post that rumors suggesting he's readying his political swansong are 'absolutely not true.' Speculation in Washington has run rampant since news broke a week ago that Boehner and his wife had purchased an $835,000 luxury condominium in the posh Florida community of Marco Island. 'Ha, ha, ha': Boehner laughed off the idea that he won't be back as speaker next year, disappointing some tea partiers who would rather see one of their own in charge . Marco Island, Florida is a luxury community with water as far as the eye can see -- and real estate prices that rival Manhattan . Fancy a swim? The Tampico has you covered, even though the beach is just a few steps away . He plunked down $185,000 as a down payment and took out a $650,000 mortgage for the rest, according to public records. But his Ohio fundraisers are still racking up record numbers, a Boehner campaign aide told MailOnline, and he's planning to campaign as hard has ever – much to the dismay of some conservatives who see him as too soft. Nationally, the speaker raked in $54 million for Republicans last year, which he distributed to incumbents, insurgent challengers, state parties and political committees at the state and national level. He filed for reelection in Ohio's Eighth Congressional District on December 9. The aide said that phone banks, neighborhood canvassing and other volunteer efforts have been underway for several weeks. And this month Boehner's campaign held a telephone town hall meeting for voters in his district, who first sent him to Congress in 1990. His Capitol Hill spokesman Michael Steel has also tried to downplay the significance of the condo purchase. Sun and surf: Marco Island is a rich man's playground, a far cry from Boehner's image as a Midwest-bred everyman . Boehner and his wife finalized the deed to their fourth-floor digs at The Tampico on February 11 . Paradise: Boehner's vacation property is ringed with palm trees, and his condo includes a personal whirlpool bath . 'This area of Florida has been the Boehners' family vacation spot for many years, and rather than continue to put money into vacation rentals year after year, they decided to buy a condo,' he said in a statement. 'Their home is in West Chester, Ohio, and will continue to be.' The always-tan Boehner is known for his teary emotional moments but had only chuckles when the subject of his retirement came up . Boehner, 64, has become more of a polarizing figure than most observers expected him to be when he took the speaker's gavel in 2011. He has tussled with tea partiers and other conservatives in his caucus over Obamacare, federal budget items, immigration, and last year's ill-fated partial government shutdown. But the perennially orange-hued Ohioan appears to be in Washington for the long haul, occupying a basement apartment in the District that he rents – in you-can't-make-this-up fashion – from a tanning lobbyist. The pricey Florida condo now in the Boehner family is in a 14-story building surrounded by beachfront property. The 2,093-square-foot home includes three bedrooms, three bathrooms and an open-floor plan whose balcony offers uninterrupted views of evening sunsets, according to Realty Today. It also features a master suite with a large walk-in shower and a whirlpool tub. One Marco Island realtor's website describes kitchens in the building, called The Tampico, as 'smartly equipped with Poggenpohl cabinetry, Corian countertops and full General Electric Monogram Series appliance package, sure to delight the chef in the family.' The location itself includes some condos with price tags as high as $2.2 million, they add, and rises 'over the sugar-white shores of the Gulf of Mexico, offering spectacular gulf and island views from gracious terraces.'","Boehner's expensive Marco lsland, Florida digs will be a vacation home, his aides insist .

A nine-year-old girl has shunned endless hours of watching TV and playing children’s computer games to read an amazing 364 books - in just seven months. Faith Jackson is such a bookworm she prefers a daily intake of Secret Seven and Famous Five to TV’s Four O’Clock Club and Bear Behaving Badly. The youngster has been hailed a real-life 'Matilda' after the book-loving Crunchem Hall schoolgirl created by author Roald Dahl. Faith Jackson, a nine year old girl from Knutsford, Cheshire, is a real-life Matilda who just loves to read, just like the Roald Dahl character . And she has been rewarded with a certificate of achievement from award-winning author Cressida Cowell who penned That Rabbit Belongs to Emily Brown and How to Train Your Dragon. Recent figures show that, unlike, Faith, today’s youngster spends more time during their childhood watching TV than they spend at school. According to scientists, by the age of seven, a child will have spent a full year glued to screens, with the average 10-year-old having five TVs readily available to watch at home. But Faith’s mother Lauren, 35, a housewife from Ashley, Cheshire, said: 'Faith says reading is just as stimulating as TV or computer games, more so even, as you have to use your own imagination rather than letting the screen conjure it all up for you. 'I don’t think it’s particularly bad, or inherently wrong, for children to be sat in front of the television, or playing on computers - but I do think it’s a shame that for many children these forms of entertainment have entirely taken the place of reading. Her reading has even caught the eye of acclaimed author Cressida Cowell and she has her own review section in the local library . Faith initially found reading a struggle but fell in love with it when she was seven after being encouraged to read more by her family and teachers . 'Personally I don’t think there’s anything wrong with watching television, and films - but only as long as you keep a pretty close eye on the subject matter of what your children are viewing. 'My only real ""rule"" on the TV revolves around the fact that we have always had only one television in the house. 'So, whatever programme is on has to be suitable for whoever is in the house at the time, and there has to be a group decision to play on the Wii computer games. 'But I always take the time out to help Faith by listening to her read. I think more parents should share a bedtime story with their children in the hopes that they will develop a passion for reading as much as my daughter has.' Faith with her letter from Cressida Cowell, one of her favourite authors whose books she devours . Faith initially found books a struggle but fell in love with reading when she was seven after being encouraged to read more by her family and teachers at Mobberley Church of England Primary School. She started with short stories which were moderately easy to read but now, only two years on, takes on more challenging Enid Blyton books and novels penned by Cressida Cowell - which can run to 400 pages. Faith began to keep track of her reading at the suggestion of her mother. As well as Enid Blyton, she reads The Hardy Boys adventures created by Edward Stratemeyer, the Harry Potter series, plus books by Tracy Beaker author Jaqueline Wilson. After classes she scours her local library at Knutsford looking for the latest new titles. Staff have even give her a section of the library to herself to quietly read and have created a display board showing her book recommendations for other youngsters. Faith has been hailed a real-life Matilda after the book loving Crunchem Hall schoolgirl created by author Roald Dahl and played by Mara Wilson . Faith began to keep track of her reading at the suggestion of her mother and loves Enid Blyton and The Hardy Boys adventures . She has also written a guest review on Enid Blyton for the American blogsite: 'This Kid Reviews Books.'

Mrs Jackson said: 'I am thrilled Faith has found something that she takes such pleasure in, that makes her feel positive about her own ability and of course, helps her at school too' 'I initially read all the Harry Potters to her - it took nearly a year to read all seven aloud and she has read a few of the earlier ones to herself too. 'She’s read a lot of Roald Dahl and particularly likes Charlie and the Chocolate Factory - although I’m not sure Faith is like Matilda because until she was seven Faith could hardly read at all.' She added: 'It is wonderful to see Faith's excitement with every new book she opens. I’m proud in everything that she does. 'The only minor point of contention over her reading is that she doesn’t seem to have much time judgement. Often my husband and I will head for bed at around 11 or midnight and she’ll still have her nose in a book. 'We have to ask her to stop reading and switch off the light because she just doesn’t want to stop - it seems like she has escaped into her own little world.' Faith said: 'I mostly like the kind of books with animals or magic or adventures in them. If they have all three of those things then it’s even better. 'When I first started, I wasn’t actually trying to read that many books, my mummy just thought that it would be a good idea to keep track of every book I had read. 'But my life is not all about books. I do four hours of gymnastics every week, do karate classes, play netball and I’m learning to play the drums. 'I also like climbing, and riding my bike, rollerblading - and watching the odd bit of television. But for me, reading is the most fun thing to do. Faith Jackson loves sports as well as reading and has just started to learn kickboxing . 'My bedroom looks like it’s built out of books,' she said. 'I have three packed bookcases and piles of books wobbling everywhere so yes, I’m running out of room! 'It’s just too hard to choose a favourite book but if I had to I would probably like The Hardy Boys series the best though. Reading can help your education, your imagination - and it’s just so much fun.' Author Cressida Cowell said: 'Reading for pleasure is one of the key factors in a child’s later educational success, and as a nation we need to get our children reading for the joy of it, and talking excitedly to their friends about books, just as Faith is doing.'","Faith Jackson from Cheshire spends hours a day reading .

Newly-released court documents have revealed that an FBI source had a meeting with former al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in 1993. The meeting between the informant that the FBI worked with and the now-dead terror chief produced such specific intel for the FBI that they were able to thwart an attack against a British cruise liner and another in Los Angeles. The previously-unknown meeting came to light because Bassem Yousssef, a disgruntled FBI agent, filed a discrimination lawsuit against the agency, and during the court hearing, one of his bosses told of the agent's successes at the bureau. The Washington Times reported that former FBI official Edward Curran testified on Mr Youssef's behalf in the 2010 discrimination case. Mr Curran told the court how Mr Youssef was able to cultivate a source who was closely-tied to another al Qaeda leader, Omar Abdel-Rahman, commonly known as the 'blind Sheik' who was responsible for the 1993 attack on the World Trade Center. The source, who was described as being 'very in tight, close' with the al Qaeda leadership, was reportedly in regular contact with the FBI when he met personally with bin Laden at some point in 1993. As a result of that meeting, the FBI was given enough information to stop planned attacks on a Masonic lodge in Los Angeles and helped reveal two previously-secret terror cells in California. Working back-channels: The revelations came as a part of a discrimination suit filed by FBI agent Bassem Youssef (pictured) who is the one who cultivated the source that got in direct contact with Osama bin Laden . 'It was the only source I know in the bureau where we had a source right in Al Qaeda, directly involved,' said Mr Curran, who headed the FBI's office in Los Angeles at the time. The Washington Times revealed no further details about the British cruise liner that was reportedly suggested as a potential target. The news of the FBI's source meeting with bin Laden on more than one occassion in 1993 and 1994 will make waves because it comes in direct contrast to previous testimony that was used as the 'accepted' timeline of events leading up to the September 11 attacks. The 9/11 Commission Report described the FBI's intelligence on bin Laden at the time as being 'at best cloudy' and made no mention of a source who had direct contact with the terrorist. Leader: The source was close with 'blind Sheik' Omar Abdel-Rahman, the al Qaeda official who was reportedly behind the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center . It is unclear why the courtroom revelations- which were initially made in 2010- were not unearthed until now but the former head of the 9/11 Commission argues that the source was not directly related to the plot against the World Trade Center. 'Both the commission and the U.S. government compiled a fair amount of evidence about the activities of the set of groups later best known as al Qaeda during [the early-1990s], when the group was settling into Sudan. We did not delve as deeply in this period because it was so distant from the plotting that led directly to the 9/11 attack,' Philip Zelikow, the 9/11 Commission's executive director, told The Washington Times. The discrimination case came after Mr Youssef filed a suit against the bureau saying that he was sidelined after September 11 because his colleagues thought he was an Arab Muslim. Those assumptions were incorrect, as the highly decorated agent is actually Coptic Christian.","An al Qaeda insider reportedly met with Osama bin Laden more than once in 1993 and 1994, as newly-released court transcripts reveal .

Gary Melius, 69, is being guarded by police in hospital after an alleged botched hit on the castle owner on Monday . Oheka Castle owner Gary Melius, who was shot through the eye in an apparent assassination attempt, once had debts of $6million, court records revealed. The political power broker, 69, is in a stable condition after being shot in an alleged botched hit by a masked gunman outside his Long Island castle on Monday. Melius is said to deeply fear for his life and those of his family. He is being protected under police guard in his hospital room. Police have no suspect and no motive in the point-blank shooting of Melius, a multimillionaire hotelier. However the high-rolling lifestyle of the political mover and shaker might offer some clues. According to court records, Melius has a history of million-dollar debts - including owing $100,000 for unspecified reasons at Donald Trump's Taj Mahal Casino Hotel in Atlantic City, New Jersey in 1993. The Key Bank, the Bank of New York . and Dime Savings also sued Melius for close to $6million, according to filings. The IRS was also after the businessman - suing Melius for almost $200,000 in taxes in the early Nineties. Friends of  Melius have warned the masked gunman to turn himself in. 'We . are going to find the guy who did this,' best friend Darren Aquino told . MailOnline on Tuesday. 'This is not a sane man (the gunman). What kind of normal . person would do that?

Discovery: Gary Melius was found shot by his daughter Kelly Melius  (pictured) who rushed him to . hospital herself . Last year, Melius was part of a controversy that resulted in the ouster of then-Nassau County Police Commissioner Thomas Dale over the arrest of a witness in an election lawsuit. The district attorney found that Dale had instructed officers to arrest a 29-year-old Roosevelt man, who had testified in an unrelated case that he had been paid to collect signatures for a third-party candidate. Melius, a supporter of the third-party candidate, then contacted Dale seeking to have the young man investigated. The young man was arrested on an outstanding warrant while riding a county bus on October 5th. An investigation by the Nassau County district attorney found no evidence of criminal wrongdoing but raised questions about the ethics of Dale's actions, leading to his resignation. Melius was 'alert and conscious and cracking jokes' before going into surgery', said Sgt. John O'Sullivan. His close friend, former U.S. Senator Alfonse D'Amato rushed to his bedside, later tweeting: 'Friends, thank you for your kind words. Please keep my dear friend Gary Melius in your prayers.' D'Amato was waiting to meet Melius for a meal at a local steakhouse when he was informed of his friends shooting. 'It was not a robbery,' Mr D'Amato said after leaving Melius' bedside according to Newsday. 'It was an attempt at assassination. He was at the Castle, outside. Nobody put a gun to him or said, 'We want your money.' They just shot him. The guy had a mask on.' Shot: Multi-millionaire Gary Melius was shot in front of Oheka Castle in New York's Long Island .

George Zimmerman has been investigated by police over allegations that he sent an 'inappropriate still shot photo from an intimate home video' of his girlfriend and sent it to her 11 year-old daughter . George Zimmerman has been investigated by police over allegations that he sent an ‘inappropriate still shot photo from an intimate home video’ of his girlfriend and sent it to her 11-year-old daughter. The incident dates back to the domestic dispute between Zimmerman and girlfriend Samantha Scheibe at their Florida home last November. When Scheibe meet with the Seminole Sheriff’s Office in Sanford on November 19, 2013 to discuss the domestic violence incident ‘Scheibe also stated that George Zimmerman had sent [her] 11 year old daughter an inappropriate still shot photo from an intimate home video,’ states the police report seen by RadarOnline. Scheibe told police that ‘some time ago’ she had made a video that was ‘sexual in nature.’ She said that Zimmerman had found the video on her cell phone and sent it to his own. According to Scheibe, he also took a still photograph from the video - depicting her lying on a bed - which he then forwarded to her daughter’s cell phone along with the message, ‘Ask mommie what this is’. Investigators met with Scheibe’s daughter to view the photograph, but determined that it ‘did not show anything pornographic at all’ and ‘only depicted Samantha Scheibe’s upper body and a headboard in the background.’ Back together: Zimmerman and girlfriend Samantha Scheibe, center,  got back together shortly after November's altercation and were pictured smiling when they picked up his guns only weeks later . Zimmerman was subsequently charged with felony aggravated assault in connection with the original domestic incident with Scheibe. She eventually dropped the charges, telling police she had ‘misspoken’ in her statements to police. The same police report revealed that Zimmerman has a formidable one-man arsenal - including an AR-15 assault-style rifle, a shotgun and three handguns. According to the police report, the handguns were fully loaded when cops arrived on the scene, and Scheibe said he brandished his shotgun when she started moving belongings out of the home that the two shared. The report showed Zimmerman owns a semi-automatic AR-15, a Keltec 12-gauge shotgun, a Walther .380 handgun, a Taurus 9mm handgun, a Glock 19 handgun, more than 100 rounds of ammunition and countless gun holsters and bags. Samantha . Scheibe told police that she had shot a video on her phone which was 'sexual in nature' which . Zimmerman then forwarded to his phone and even sent an image to her daughter, 11 . Authorities seized the gun collection after Scheibe called 911 last November telling the dispatcher that her infamous boyfriend was pointing a gun at her and had smashed a glass coffee table when she said she was leaving him. Zimmerman ‘grabbed the shotgun out of the case,’ she told police, according to the report. ‘George Zimmerman then pointed the shotgun at her and asked, ‘Do you really want to do that?’ Then she said she was calling 911, the report said. He ‘struck a glass top table in the living room using the butt of the shotgun, causing it to shatter,’ according to the report. Zimmerman then slung the shotgun ‘over his shoulder… pushed her out of the house and locked the door behind her,’ the report said. Police arrested the unstable former neighborhood watchman and charged him with aggravated assault, domestic violence and battery. Authorities issued a restraining order against Zimmerman after Schiebe further accused him of choking her during a subsequent interview with investigators, but she later dropped all charges and claimed she had been ‘intimidated’ by police. 'Visibly . shaken': Scheibe, pictured, was with Zimmerman when he had a showdown with his wife Shellie over their . divorce last September . A friend of Scheibe’s told MailOnline at the time that loved ones feared for her safety. ‘We . would all talk about where the relationship was going, and we knew it . would end badly,’ the woman said. ‘He is just a time bomb waiting to go . off.' Those sentiments were also echoed last year by both his estranged wife Shellie Zimmerman, who also called him a 'monster,' and Sanford Police Chief Steve Bracknell. Bracknell famously agreed with a local’s comparison of the risk posed by Zimmerman to Sandy Hook shooter Adam Lanza. The smiling couple was the picture of happiness when seen a few weeks later leaving a local police department after picking up the guns. The crux of his defense for shooting the unarmed Trayvon Martin, 17, was that he couldn’t defend himself against the teen. He also said he also forced to flee a Miami Beach after people accosted him and a $10,000 bounty was placed on his head. Heavy firepower: A simple attachment to the AR-15 owned by Zimmerman (similar to the one at left) allows it to legally fire 900 rounds per minute, and the shotgun is powerful enough to take down a fully grown deer . Concealed carry: Zimmerman also owns two pistols like the Glock 19 (left) and the Taurus 9mm (right) above, both can easily be carried by the owner in a manner that others can't see .","During November's domestic dispute, Samantha Scheibe told police that Zimmerman had sent the 'inappropriate' video to her daughter, 11 .

Shock: Robitaille, pictured today, said when Myers made the claim in 1976, he brushed it off as lies . The Zodiac Killer had claimed through a series of cryptic letters - which were signed with the zodiac sign and sent to local newspapers - that he was responsible for 37 deaths in the San Francisco Bay area, but police have pinned just five on him. In December 1968, he forced two teenagers in Benicia out of their car before shooting them. In July 1969, a couple was shot while parked in Vallejo, although the male victim survived. Then in September 1969, a masked man stabbed two people at Lake Berryessa in Napa County, again killing one of them, and in October of that year,  a San Francisco cab driver was shot dead. Speaking to ABC7, Kenney said that Myers had claimed he had targeted young couples because his girlfriend had broken up with him, but that the taxi driver had been killed simply for drug money. Kenney added that the zodiac sign on the . letters wasn't actually a zodiac sign at all, but a Celtic cross because . Myers was obsessed with Celtic culture. Did he do it?

Kenney also worked at Terry's restaurant in Vallejo, where he met another victim, Darlene Ferrin. He said that there was another connection - a military-style boot print found at one crime scene. Myers could have had access to such boots while working at . Victory Military Surplus in Vallejo. After the murders, Myers was arrested on other charges, including disorderly conduct, theft and possession of stolen property. To stay out of trouble, he joined the Army.

A Florida congressional hopeful has revealed how fatally striking a pedestrian with his car when he was 16 'still weighs heavy on my heart'. David Jolly, a Republican battling to represent Florida's 13th Congressional District, questioned why stories about the 1989 crash had resurfaced so shortly ahead of the March 11 election. He was found not to be at fault for the death of 30-year-old Blair Ropes, who was struck on June 9, 1989 as he walked along the side of a busy road in Tampa after his motorcycle broke down. 'It was a human tragedy that occurred when I was a young man,' Jolly, 41, told WTSP when they first asked him about the accident. Speaking out: David Jolly, who is in a race for a special election in Florida, fatally hit a 30-year-old man with his car in 1989, but was not deemed to be at fault. He has said it took him a long time to find peace . 'It took several years for me to get . to a place of peace, but not something anybody would ever get over. I'll be honest, for several years it challenged my faith. I questioned how such things could happen, but tragedy occurs.' In a statement, he added: 'This was a tragic accident where a . man lost his life and a family lost a loved one. It continues to weigh heavy on my heart after 25 . years and we owe the family our deepest sympathies every day.' WTSP-TV in St Petersburg first reported about the crash on Monday and an anonymous note was sent to the Tampa Bay Times about the 25-year-old incident. 'The facts of this accident have been public record for years,' Jolly added. 'It is disrespectful and hurtful to the surviving family that someone would now dig this tragedy up to use for political gain. 'Out of respect for the family and friends who lost a loved one, I will have no further comment.' A 16-year-old Jolly was driving his father's car from a Tampa mall to Dade City, where he lived, with a female passenger at 9.30pm on the night of the crash. Scene: The crash occurred on what is now Bruce B Downs Boulevard in Tampa. A man was walking along the road after his motorcycle broke down when Jolly, who was heading home from the mall, hit him .

Ropes, who was wearing black and walking with the flow of the traffic, was struck by Jolly's right front bumper. The troopers' report noted that there was no sidewalk along the road. Ropes was thrown 147 feet and was pronounced dead on the scene. The report said that Jolly did not . stop and instead drove to a nearby convenience store to call emergency . workers. He then returned to the scene and told troopers he had not seen Ropes. Vendl told troopers at the . time that she was not hurt, but several weeks later she said she had been struck . and had an injured elbow. Troopers wrote in their report that Ropes was at fault in the crash because he was not facing oncoming traffic as he walked, a violation of Florida law. Jolly did not face any charges.

A San Diego family in mourning in suing Petco after they say their 10-year-old boy died from rat-bite fever he contracted from a pet purchased from the retailer. Aidan Pankey died just hours after coming down with flu-like symptoms two weeks after buying a mate for his pet rat at the Carmel Mountain Petco. San Diego County medical examiners would later rule his death was caused by streptobacillus moniliformis, or rat-bite fever, and now his family wants unspecificed damages from the national chain for failing to prevent his tragic death. Scroll down for video... Rat-bit fever: 10-year-old Aidan Pankey died last June from bacteria his family says was transmitted from a pet rat . Attorney John Gomez told The Associated Press on Tuesday that his firm filed the lawsuit Monday in San Diego County for the suffering endured by the Pankey family after Aidan died June 12. ‘He was a bright, energetic, friendly, happy kid who actually had a prior rat, who was a female, and he had this idea in his young head of having his female rat get married,’ Gomez said. Aidan's grandmother Sharon Pankey took the boy to the Carmel Mountain Petco location to buy him a second rat after seeing how happy the first one made him. 'He'd pop her on his shoulder and that little rat would hang on,' Sharon Pankey told ABC News. 'It was like she was saying all right! Let's go dad.' Loving pet owner: The San Diego boy loved his pet rat Oreo (pictured) and bought a male rat at Petco in May in hopes the two would mate . Sudden: Aidan and his grandmother purchased the male at Carmel Mountain, California's Petco location. two weeks later, Aidan would be dead . Streptobacillus moniliformis . Rat bite fever is a bacterial infection caused by either Streptobacillus moniliformis or Spirillum minus, both are found in the mouths of rodents. Symptoms include chills, fever, joint pain, redness, swelling, rash and swollen glands. With treatment, which consists of a 7-14 round of antibiotics, prognosis is good. Untreated, the death rate is as high as 25 percent. Rat-bite fever may also be known as Streptobacillary fever, Streptobacillosis, Haverhill fever, Epidemic arthritic erythema, Spirillary fever, or Sodoku. She said Aidan wanted to breed his female rat oreo. 'He said, ""you know Grammy when Oreo has babies I'm going to be grandpa and you're going to be a great-grandma,""' Sharon said. But that opportunity would never come. Over the course of one summer day, Aidan went from energetic young boy to death. 'I put him to bed after a day at the doctor’s office and the next thing I knew it just was too late,' Sharon said.  'I went into his room and he couldn’t speak. He was unstable on his feet. I got him down to my room and he collapsed on the floor. I called 911 because it was scaring me that his breathing was shallow and he seemed to be losing his ability to function.' 'We didn’t know what he died from at first,' she said. 'When I took him to doctor he said he had the flu, but you don’t die from flu in less than 48 hours.' It wasn't until Christmas that the family learned the true cause of Aidan's death. But they'd already begun to fall apart. Dead in a day: 'I put him to bed after a day at the doctor¿s office and the next thing I knew it just was too late,' Aidan's grandmother Sharon Pankey said.  'I went into his room and he couldn¿t speak. He was unstable on his feet.' 'He was my family,' said Aidan's distraught father Andrew Pankey. 'I'm probably down 30 to 35 pounds since then. I don't even get hungry. I just go until I pass out.' Who's at fault? The family is suing Petco for unspecified damages in a suit that claims that were negligent in preventing Aidan's death . 'He was my family,' Aidan's father Andrew Pankey told ABC 15. 'I'm probably down 30 to 35 pounds since then. I don't even get hungry. I just go until I pass out.' According to ABC15, the Carmel Mountain Petco sources its rodents from Barney's Pet Supply, a large wholesaler in Chino, California. The retailer in a statement expressed its condolences. ‘We are deeply saddened by the Pankey family's tragic loss,’ Petco said in a statement. ‘The health and safety of people and pets is always a top priority, and we take the family's concerns very seriously.’ Petco insisted in a statement that it uses the most rigorous safety standards in the industry. But the family is concerned that's not enough. 'It's a means to ensure this doesn't happen again,' Gomez said of the lawsuit. 'Apparently there was some breakdown in procedures. They want tighter controls.' ¿We are deeply saddened by the Pankey family's tragic loss,¿ Petco said in a statement. ¿The health and safety of people and pets is always a top priority, and we take the family's concerns very seriously.¿ .

A man who claims to have captured and killed Bigfoot after luring it with pork ribs has begun a tour across the south, showing off its corpse. Rick Dyer, who describes himself as 'best Bigfoot tracker in the world', claims to have shot the beast near San Antonio in Texas in September 2012. Despite releasing various photographs supposedly showing the dead Bigfoot, there is a great deal of skepticism over their authenticity. Mr Dyer, who is a used car salesman, was previously involved in a Bigfoot hoax in 2008 when a 'corpse' he put on public display turned out to be a rubber suit. Scroll down for video... Believe it or not: Here lies Bigfoot who was killed by used car salesman, Rick Dyer in 2012. He is now on tour with the corpse. Dyer is the same person who staged a Bigfoot hoax in 2008 but this time he swears he is not lying . On display: Rick Dyer released this new image, supposedly showing the Bigfoot he killed lying dead on the floor of his tent. He is now taking the corpse on a cross-country tour . Is he for real? Rick Dyer calls himself a 'Master Tracker' but also knows there are people out there who are going to dispute his claim, and he doesn't care . Raking it in: Dyer is on a nationwide tour showing off his supposed Bigfoot corpse for $20 per person . The display is now in Houston and drew about 800 people to Trader's Village in northwest Harris County on Sunday. 'We got here a day early and we just wanted to show as many people as possible,' said Mr Dyer. 'Bigfoot is not the Tooth Fairy. Bigfoot is real.' People of all ages shelled out money to enter his trailer to look into the 9-foot case that holds the specimen Dyer calls Hank. The body of the creature can be viewed under a glass coffin adorned with camouflaged baseball hats. 'I'm not convinced,' said Mario Lopez, after taking a look with his wife Julia and their three children. 'I believe the Roger Patterson footage is authentic because you can see the muscles and everything on there, but this one was kind of different. But he did mention that after the autopsy the body kind of changes,' he said to the Houston Chronicle. Roger Patterson is the man who filmed one of the most famous 'sightings' back in 1967. Patterson died in 1972, and the man who wore the gorilla suit in the film even admitted it was a hoax, . Wendy Hernandez was so convinced that she bought a shirt and had Dyer sign it. 'It's amazing when you go inside, you feel different,' she said. 'I had never seen anything like this before, only on the Discovery Channel.' Body of the beast: Rick Dyer claims that this is a photo of legendary creature Bigfoot, which he shot near San Antonio 18 months ago . Mr Dyer claims that he lured the 800 pound beast by nailing pork ribs he had bought from Walmart to a tree in San Antonio, Texas in September 2012. He initially released a grainy close up photograph supposedly showing the creature's face, but has now released a second photograph of it lying dead on the floor of his tent. Speaking about inevitable doubts over the authenticity of his supposed kill, 36-year-old Dyer said he didn't regret his 2008 hoax, as it put him in contact with people who now fund his full-time Bigfoot operations ever since. He claims that without the previous publicity stunt, he would never have been able to 'really capture' a Bigfoot. 'I have 13 months with it,' Dyer said last month. 'Then it will probably go into a museum as the first Bigfoot ever killed.' On the Bigfoot trail: Rick Dyer says he managed to lure the beast in by nailing some pork ribs that he bought at Walmart to a tree. While the creature was eating, Mr Dyer allegedly shot it . Speaking of the moment he killed the beast, he . said: 'I nailed... pork ribs from the Walmart down the street to the . side of the tree, and lo and behold, he came and started eating the pork . ribs off the tree.' Mr . Dyer claims to have filmed the creature as he was enjoying his last meal . before going to get his gun and 'with tears in my eyes' shot it . dead. The excitement surrounding Mr Dyer's claims is tempered somewhat by the fact that he was involved in a Bigfoot hoax back in 2008. Back then, as now, he claimed he had the body of Bigfoot. But The National Geographic reported that, once the frozen body began to thaw, the body turned out to be nothing more than a rubber ape suit. This time Mr Dyer is adamant that his Bigfoot is 'for real'. He said: 'From DNA tests to 3D optical scans to body scans. It is the real deal. It's Bigfoot and Bigfoot's here, and I shot it and now I'm proving it to the world.' Video by Rick Dyer . Committed hunter: Mr Dyer is a self-proclaimed 'real' Bigfoot tracker, although he is a used car salesman in his spare time . 'There was a hoax in 2008,' he said. 'It didn’t start out as a hoax and that’s what people don’t understand. This is about redeeming myself. I don’t want to go down as a hoaxer. I . want to go down as the best Bigfoot tracker in the world.' However, Mr Dyer has yet to produce the results of the DNA tests and optical scans.

End of story: Convicted killer Michael Taylor . is shown in this Missouri Department of Corrections photo released just . hours before he was executed by lethal injection . A man convicted of abducting, raping and killing a Kansas City teenager in 1989 was put to death tonight using a lethal drug after last-minute appeals Tuesday failed to stay Missouri's fourth execution in as many months. Michael Taylor, 47, of Kansas City, was executed at 12.01am Wednesday. The U.S. Supreme Court late on Tuesday denied an 11th-hour flurry of petitions filed on Taylor's behalf after the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied Taylor's request for a rehearing and Gov. Jay Nixon denied a clemency request. In a statement from the Missouri Department of Public Safety, spokesperson Mike O'Connell said that Taylor was executed at the Eastern Reception, Diagnostic and Correctional Center in Bonnee Terre. He was pronounced dead at 12.10am local time. Taylor offered no final statement. He took two deep breaths before closing his eyes for the last time. Taylor's attorneys have questioned Missouri's use of an unnamed compounding pharmacy to provide the pentobarbital for his execution. They have also raised concerns that the state executes men before appeals are complete, and claim Taylor's original trial attorney was so overworked that she encouraged him to plead guilty to lessen her own workload. After years of using a three-drug execution method, Missouri switched to pentobarbital as a single fatal drug late last year. State officials say there were no outward signs of distress in three recent executions that all relied on a single dose of pentobarbital. Last week, the Oklahoma-based Apothecary Shoppe agreed that it would not supply the pentobarbital for Taylor's execution. Attorney General Chris Koster's office announced in a court filing on Febuary 19 that a new provider had been found, but has refused to name the pharmacy, citing the state's execution protocol that allows for the manufacturer to remain anonymous. Scroll down for video . Brutal crime: Ann Harrison (left), 15, was awaiting a school bus in Raytown, Missouri, when she was abducted by Taylor (right) and Roderick Nunley, who raped and then stabbed her to death . Taylor's attorneys said use of the drug . without naming the compounding pharmacy could cause the inmate pain and . suffering because no one can check if the operation is legitimate and . has not been accused of any violations. 'We have no idea about the track record of this pharmacy,' Taylor's attorney, John Simon, said. Pete Edlund doesn't want to hear it. Edlund, 69 and retired from the Kansas City Police Department, led the . investigation into Ann Harrison's death. Taylor, 47, and Roderick Nunley . were convicted of abducting, raping and killing the 15-year-old girl in . Kansas City in 1989. Taylor's attorneys have questioned Missouri's use of an unnamed compounding pharmacy to provide the pentobarbital for his execution . 'Cruel and unusual punishment would be . if we killed them the same way they killed Annie Harrison,' Edlund . said. 'Get a damn rope, string them up, put them in the gas chamber. Whatever it takes.' In a phone call from death row just hours before his death, Taylor told the Kansas City Star that he had written a letter to his victim's parents expressing his 'sincerest apology and heartfelt remorse.' 'I hope that they’ll accept it,' Taylor said of the letter. Taylor was nearly executed in 2006 before a late court-ordered reprieve after revelations about problems with the state's lethal injection practices at that time. On Tuesday night, the string of terse denials, issued for the high court by Justice . Samuel Alito, presumably cleared the way for Taylor's execution to . proceed as scheduled. Ann Harrison was waiting for the school bus on the morning of March 22, 1989, when Nunley and Taylor, then in their early 20s, drove past in a car they had stolen after a night while binging on crack cocaine. One of the men jumped out of the car and grabbed Ann, forcing her into the vehicle. Both have claimed the other did it. The men drove to the home of Nunley's mother. Ann was forced into the basement and raped — DNA testing linked Taylor. Afraid she would be able to identify them, the men used kitchen knives to stab the girl repeatedly, even as Ann begged for her life and offered money if they would let her live. She died about 30 minutes later. Taylor and Nunley put her in the trunk of the stolen car, abandoned the car in a neighborhood then walked away. The body was found three days later. Edlund said the crime went unsolved for about six months. A $10,000 . reward led to a tip, and Taylor and Nunley were both arrested. Both . pleaded guilty and were sentenced to death in 1991. After their sentences were overturned, they were again sentenced to death in 1994. Nunley is also on death row, but the state has yet to schedule his execution. Linda . Taylor, Michael Taylor's mother, issued a statement with other family . members stating Taylor had great remorse for his crime. The family did . not want to see Taylor executed and Linda Taylor has said that life in . prison should have been be sufficient punishment.

Marked men: Allen Nicklasson (left) was put to death in December, followed by Herbert Smulls in January . Janel Harrison, mother of the victim, said the execution was needed justice for her daughter. 'There should be an ultimate penalty,' Harrison said. Missouri could be on pace for a record number of executions in 2014. Last week, the Missouri Supreme Court set a March 26 execution date for Jeffrey Ferguson, convicted of abducting, raping and killing a 17-year-old girl in St. Charles 25 years ago. Several other inmates on death row have also exhausted all but last-minute court appeals and could soon face execution.

Prosecutors said Knysz had stolen guns with him when Butterfield pulled over his pickup truck in Mason County, in west-central Michigan.

Slain: Trooper Paul Butterfield II was shot dead by Eric Knysz during a routine traffic stop in September . In his closing arguments, defense attorney David Glancy noted that the only witness who could place Knysz in the pickup that day was his wife, Sarah, who testified against him. Glancy said she benefited from a plea deal with prosecutors that brought her a sentence of two to five years in prison as an accessory after the fact. But jurors sided with prosecutors after deliberating for about two hours. ""Justice was served,"" Col. Kriste Kibbey Etue, state police commander, told the Ludington Daily News. Butterfield's fiancee, Jen Sielski, said the verdict doesn't bring back Butterfield but protects the public. ""At least the killer won't hurt anyone else,"" Sielski said. At the December 2013 sentencing of . Sarah Knysz for being an accessory, Mr Butterfield Sr handed her a . family photo and told her: 'I have seen your tears. I believe your tears . are not a result of sorrow for our son’s death, but because you got . caught.'

[your] child that he or she is removed totally from your family and . adopted [by a loving, stable family].' Knysz, . who was in the car at the time of the shooting had told the court it . was out of fear for her life and that of her unborn child that she . protected her husband after the shooting, M Live reported. 'There wasn’t anything that I thought I could have done that day,' she said. 'He . had a gun and he shot the trooper, and if he did that, what was he . going to do to a witness that was going to tell on him and was going to . turn him in?

In addition to her aspirations to walk on Mars, Gerardi is getting plenty of adventure here on Earth - she's spent time exploring the seclusive nation of North Korea and spent several weeks studying the extended necks of the women of the Kayan tribe in Myanmar. She's also a member of the legendary Explorers Club, a non-profit organization that devotes resources to studying the previously unknown. 'We have a whole range of space enthusiasts,' she said of the club, which includes famous interplanetary members like Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin.

Gerardi says she realizes that if her dreams of going to Mars are realized, there's a chance that she would have to forgo a future with her fiance, a 36-year-old who works in finance whom Gerardi asked to not identify by name for professional reasons.

Nightmarish: Passengers revealed gruesome details of their ordeal after enduring five days of overflowing toilets, feces-covered decks and overpowering stench . 'I did not get physically injured. I got mentally injured,' said Cripps, who suffers from Parkinson's disease and whose husband is diabetic. 'The whole experience never ends...It's over and over again.' According to CNN, U.S. District Judge Donald Graham made a sweeping ruling prior to testimony that Carnival is indeed responsible for the fire that left the cruise helpless and adrift. 'It is highly likely that Carnival was responsible for a reasonably probable causes to which the accident could have be (sic) attributed. Here, the facts of the occurrence warrant the inference of negligence,' Graham wrote. However, the judge also ruled that the passengers, per their agreements with Carnival, were not guaranteed a safe cruise and therefor the company was not in breach of contract. Nevertheless, the passengers will . continue to testify to the extent of their emotional distress and . injuries for at least another week in an attempt to convince the judge . they deserve compensation from Carnival. Those . include testimonies like the Cripps', who emphasized an extreme fear of . physical injury during the debacle--not least of all because Alton . Crisp went without his diabetes medication for days--and other . passengers' with less tangible but far more stomach-turning flirtations . with disaster. Carnival failure? The Carnival Triumph was anything but after a fire knocked out power and left 3,000 passengers without power, with very little food, and fearing for their lives in some cases . Suffering after a year: Now 31 passengers have filed a civil suit against Carnival and want compensation for the emotional trauma some of them say they relive even now, a year later . Like Fleda Key, who described having terrible diarrhea on the already feces-covered ship and the distinct lack of usable toilets. 'There was lots of urine and feces all the way up to the rim of every one,' said the 68-year-old. '(I) choked away the smell...I was fearful, downright afraid and scared.' 'I walked through water and feces and urine, no telling what else,' Key's daugher Michelle Key agreed on the stand. 'We would slip and slide through greasy, gross, slippery muck.' Like many of the passengers, the Keys said they feared they wouldn't make it home alive from the trip. Houston-based plaintiff's attorney Frank Spagnoletti said each passenger should receive anywhere from $30,000 to $1 million in compensation, depending on the severity of their injuries. 'There's documented evidence with regard to any number of plaintiffs that show that they were physically injured, and there is ample documented evidence that shows that all of the plaintiffs were injured mentally because of the way they were exposed to this,' he said in his opening statement. Miami attorney Curtis Mase, representing Carnival, said the claims of injuries are overblown. 'There are a number who I believe deserve nothing. And I will tell you this, the one or two that I can think of who have significant injuries, they're very much in the minority and there are only one or two,' Mase said. Steep: The attorney representing the plaintiffs said they're asking for between $30,000 and $1 million for each of the 31 passengers . Inhumane conditions: Passengers were reduced to going to the bathroom in biohazard bags and placing excrement outside their cabins in the hallways .","31 passengers who were stranded aboard the Carnival Triumph in February 2013 are alleging the company is responsible for their suffering .

Explosive: Kara Koriath, 44 (pictured), is facing charges of second-degree assault after igniting fireworks while driving her two teenage sons in November . A 44-year-old Missouri mother is being accused of trying to kill her two teenage sons in a revenge plot aimed at an ex-lover who refused to leave his wife for her. Kara Koriath, of St Louis County, set off fireworks inside her SUV while driving sons Andrew and Matthew Dreste, 16 and 13, the morning of November 20. The SUV caught fire, causing Koriath to lose control of the GMC Arcadia and crash - hitting a guardrail and two signs. All three survived, but prosecutors say that wasn't Koriath's intent. On Tuesday, the mother was charged with two counts of first-degree assault for the smoke inhalation and burns suffered by her two sons. According to documents filed in court, Koriath planned the attack after getting into a row with her married boyfriend the night before. Cell phone documents show she gave him an ultimatum to leave his wife, but he seemed to refuse. She then sent a series of 'good-bye texts', including the ominous: 'it will haunt you every day of your life'.

There were 'numerous packages of fireworks strategically placed and tied together with fuses and pipe cleaners throughout the vehicle' and gasoline soaked the floorboards. Koriath, at least, didn't seem to think she would survive the well-organized explosion. At her home, investigators found after-death instructions, a will left on the desk, suicide letters and a recently-purchased life-insurance policy. Initially, the mother was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of prescription pills, but the additional charges were added on Tuesday. Her bail has been set at $200,000.

The drought in California is causing farmland to die, and threatening the water supplies of rural communities, but it's been a godsend for modern gold miners. Prospectors say the drought is causing a second Gold Rush, since extremely low water levels are opening up areas never mined before. 'A lot of time you would just see a husband. Now you’re seeing the whole family out,' Kevin Hoagland, of the Gold Prospectors Association of America, told KCAL. Like 1849 all over again: Low water levels in California's historic drought are opening up areas never touched by miners and causing what prospectors are calling a second Gold Rush . Lucky strike: Beginners can expect to find anywhere between $5 and $200 worth of gold in these 'untouched' areas . The first Gold Rush began in 1848 when deposits of the precious metal were discovered in Coloma, California. That set off a mass migration, with some 300,000 people (forty-niners) from all over the U.S. and world coming to California with the hopes of striking it rich. In the first five years of the Gold Rush, an estimated 12million ounces of gold were mined - worth more than $16million today - but the rush soon fizzled out. Get rich quick: More than 300,000 people migrated to California during the Gold Rush of 1849, but the previous metal deposits mostly dried up by 1855 . With the current drought, modern prospectors say they're digging in places never touched by the forty-niners. Hoagland points out several places on Lytle Creek, just 60 miles from Los Angeles, that would have been inaccessible just a few years ago because of swift water. 'I'm 50-some odd years old and I have never had water levels in this area this low,' he said. Brief: The second Gold Rush may be over as soon as it started though. Rain is expected to his the Los Angeles area this weekend with the heaviest rainfall on Friday morning into the afternoon . More prospectors have been coming out to the creek in recent weeks with pans, slough boxes and metal detectors than is usual for the winter. Gold is currently selling for $1300 a troy ounce, and Hoagland says beginners can make anywhere between $5 and $200 a day. But this second Gold Rush may be over as soon as it started. A storm is set to hit southern California Friday and could last all weekend, with the heaviest rainfall expected Friday morning into the afternoon, according to the National Weather Service. Record drought: These satellite images show the . parched California landscape this year compared to a normal year with . plenty of foliage and snow coverage last year . Today: California's drought continues to worsen, with ten rural communities identified as having fewer than 60 days' supply of water . Parched: Water levels for many of California's . major reservoirs are well below average and dropping; concern is . mounting that California may be headed for a replay of the big drought . of the late 1980s through the early 1990s, or even worse, 1977 . This has local authorities worried about mudslides and traffic accidents with so much rain in such a short period of time. Since July, Los Angeles has received just 1.2 inches of rain, which means there's been a build-up of oil on the roads that will become slick once wet. It's also a cause for concern for residents living in hilly areas. Many residents in Glendora took off work Tuesday just to protect their homes from the expected storm. Getting ready: Residents in Glendora pictured sandbagging their homes in preparation for the storm . Cause for concern: So much rain in a short amount of time has emergency officials fearing mudslides in the area . Glendora City Manager Chris Jeffers told the Los Angeles Times that the storm is a cause for concern, comparing the weather conditions to a similar event in 1968 which led to extremely damaging mudflows. Despite the dangers, the rain will be celebrated across the state where water supplies have become dangerous low. Images released by NASA comparing a full Folsom Lake in July 2011 to last month show just how desperate the situation is. The drought is causing a serious economic consequences for the state since much of the nation's most successful farmland is going to waste because there isn't any water to keep the fields alive. Before: In 2011, the Californian dam was almost full, sitting at a capacity of 97 percent . After: The capacity of Folsom Lake last month was just 17 percent, a whopping 80 percent lower than what it was 2.5 years ago . California is under the influence of a persistent upper-level ridge of high pressure anchored off its north coast that has kept the region generally warm, dry and clear.Nearly four miles high and 2,000 miles long, is to blame for the emerging drought as the mass of high air pressure has been blocking Pacific winter storms from coming ashore and bringing much needed to bring rain to the parched West Coast.The mass of high air pressure has been blocking Pacific winter storms from coming ashore in California, pushing them into Alaska and British Columbia - it is even responsible for rain and cold weather to the East Coast.Similar high-pressure zones pop up all the time during most winters, but they usually break down, allowing rain to get through to California.The duration of its presence - 13 months - is unprecedented in modern weather records and puzzling researchers - it has been named the 'ridiculously resilient ridge.'Source: Sci-Tech Today .

DVDs, word cards and books will do little, if anything, to help teach a baby to read, according to a New York University study . DVDs, word cards and books will do little, if anything, to help teach a baby to read. This is according to a New York study which claims that products designed to create infant geniuses could be a giant scam. A seven month experiment with babies aged up to 18 months found reading and flashcards made no difference to the children, but had a massive effect on the parents. The grown-ups were convinced their children were learning to read, although there was no scientific evidence to show this was true, said the study. Researchers from New York University's School of Culture, Education and Human Development tested a range of available 'reading' products for babies. This included DVDs, books with flip pages and specially designed word and picture cards, with the intention of getting the children to read earlier. The research, reported in the Journal of Educational Psychology, took place over seven months with 117 babies aged nine to 18 months. The children were randomly given different products or no products at all. The grown-ups were convinced their children were learning to read, although there was no scientific evidence to show this was true, said the study . Those given the products were asked to use them daily and researchers paid the families regular visits to test the language development of the infants and to interview parents. The youngsters were also brought into the lab to be given reading tests while tracking their eye movements. These can show experts whether a child is actually reading and recognising words or simply looking at shapes on a page, for instance. ‘While we cannot say with full assurance that infants at this age cannot learn printed words, our results make clear they did not learn printed words from the baby media product that was tested,’ said professor Susan Neuman. ‘It's clear that parents have great confidence in the impact of these products on their children. However, our study indicates this sentiment is misplaced.’ A different study published earlier this month seems to contradict findings from New York University. The study found it reading your baby a bedtime story could yield benefits for years to come. Research shows that children who are spoken to a lot are faster at understanding words. This speedy processing helps them do better at school – and could even help them get a good job, have a happy marriage and keep on the right side of the law. Psychologist Anne Fernald said that the effects are so profound that talking to children should be treated as importantly as feeding them. And it is never too early to start. Dr Fernald of Stanford University in California said: ‘If you want your kid to do well in school, talk to them as a baby. ‘If you bring a child into the world, we take on the responsibility for feeding them, keeping them clean and keeping them safe. ‘I think we now have enough scientific evidence to add something else to that list – and that is providing learning from infancy on. ‘Long before your baby is speaking, it is absorbing information about language.’","Reading made no difference to babies but had massive effect on parents .

Steven Powell has been given a release date and is due to be let out of a Utah jail after nearly two years on March 23. Powell was convicted of 14 counts of voyeurism after taking pictures of 8 and 10 year old girls who lived next door to him. He gained notoriety for his writings about his daughter-in-law Susan, who has been missing for years and whose two sons were killed by Powell's son Josh in a fiery blaze. With his son and grandsons dead and his daughter-in-law still missing, presumed dead, 63-year-old Steven is now focusing on holding on to some parts of the past by fighting for his house in Puyallup, Washington. Scroll down for video . Next battle: Steven Powell is fighting to hold on to his home even though authorities want to sell it off to pay back his victims . Deseret News reports that the two girls who that Powell took photos of were awarded a $1.8million settlement as part of a civil suit. After that December ruling, the judge ordered the Pierce County Sheriff's Office to sell off the home since it is Powell's largest non-exempt asset. Out: Powell, seen here at an earlier court appearance, is due to be released from jail next month after serving nearly two years for his voyeurism conviction . Even though Powell didn't contest the $1.8million verdict, he has been putting up a fight to hold on to his house. The 63-year-old has been acting as his own attorney and filed legal motions declaring that he should be allowed to keep the house because it is his 'homestead'. If that were found to be true, the sheriff's office would not have the legal authority to sell the house. No final verdict has been decided but his legal work has at least postponed any lasting turn as the originally-scheduled February 7 sale was pushed back because of his filings. Different judges' takes on the situation have caused a backlog in the timeline, but Powell wrote in his latest filing that he plans to reside in the Pallyup home when he is released late next month. Anne Bremner, the attorney representing the mother of one of his victims, said that his filings are simply 'a meritless flurry of motions'. They have pushed for a ruling that would prevent Powell from filing any more motions for a year, arguing that each time he does so he is just trying to avoid paying off his debts. Steven Powell's exploits gained national attention after his son Josh killed his own two sons in 2012. Susan Powell disappeared from her home in December 2009.

Defense attorneys for a Las Vegas man charged in a 2012 machete attack on his ex-girlfriend that split her scalp and severed her hands at the wrists claim he was too inebriated to remember or know what he did. Trial began Tuesday for Armando Vergara-Martinez in the March 2012 armed assault on 53-year-old Maria Del Carmen Gomez in a North Las Vegas convenience store parking lot. Vergara-Martinez's public defender, Tegan Machnich, said her client is conceding guilt on mayhem and domestic battery with a weapon causing substantial bodily harm charges. Defendant: Armando Vergara-Martinez appears in court during his trial at the Clark County Regional Justice Center, Tuesday in Las Vegas, accused of attacking his ex-girlfriend with a machete . Savage crime: Maria Del Carmen Gomez, 53, had both her hands lopped off at the wrist and her scalp split with a machete in March 2012 . Tragic end: Six months after Miss Gomez (right) survived a surgery to reattach her hands following Vergara-Martinez's (left) attack, the woman died from uterine cancer . Those charges could get Vergara-Martinez up to 25 years in state prison. The defendant, however, has pleaded not guilty to an attempted murder count. Gomez's hands were surgically reattached, but she died almost six months later from unrelated uterine cancer. On the first day of the trial, the jury was shown graphic images from the machete attack and heard grisly details about the physical damage sustained by the victim. Addressing the jurors, prosecutor . Elana Lee Graham said that Vergara-Martinez was acting with a deliberate . intent to kill his former paramour.

Evidence: North Las Vegas crime scene analyst Patrick Fischer holds a sheath to a machete . North Las Vegas crime scene analyst Dana Marks holds an evidence package containing the weapon used in the March 2012 savage attack . His defense, however, argued that the alcohol-addled man did not know what he was doing when he lopped off Gomez's hands. ‘Armando sits here, ashamed of himself, as he should be,’ one of the defense attorneys said, according to the station Fox5. The jury also heard from Domingo Cortez, who was dating Gomez at the time of the attack. He claimed in court that his predecessor was jealous, the Las Vegas Sun reported. Mr Vergara-Martinez wept as his brother read a letter that the defendant wrote before the attack, apologizing to his parents for something bad he planned to do to Gomez. The tragedy played out March 21, 2012, outside the supermarket at 530 East Craig Road, where Miss Gomez worked. She told CBS in 2012: 'I tried to open my car. He started hitting me without saying [anything]. 'He stabbed me two, three times on my head. I felt such strong hits over there. 'He cut these three fingers and left it on the floor.' Successful operation: Doctors were able to reattach Gomez's lopped off hands . Grisly: It is believed that Gomez was using her hands to protect her head from the machete blows . Scalped: The skin on the woman's head was split, and doctors said she could have been decapitated had her attacker aimed the machete blade a few inches lower . On Tuesday, a shopper who was at the Green Valley . Grocery that day testified that she remembered hearing a . ‘ka-ching’ sound each time the machete blade made contact with Gomez’s . body.

Less than one in 10 female soldiers want a combat job, a survey of the 170,000 women serving in the U.S. Army has revealed - and for those who want to serve in battle, the vast majority agree that physical standards must not be lowered to accommodate women. With roughly one in five Army . positions considered combat-related, commanders are turning to science . to find a unisex standard to judge which soldiers physically have the . right stuff to fight wars. Testing . at Fort Stewart and other U.S. bases is breaking away from the Army's . longtime standards for physical fitness — pushups, sit-ups and two-mile . runs — to focus instead on battlefield tasks, such as dragging a wounded . comrade to safety or installing and removing the heavy barrel of the 25 . mm gun mounted on Bradley vehicles. Heavy lifting: U.S. Army Corporal Jacqueline Beachum carries a 65-pound T.O.W. missile several yards before loading it into a launcher on a Bradley fighting vehicle .

Last year, the Pentagon ordered that women must have the same opportunities to serve in combat jobs as men, with thousands of positions slated to open to both genders in 2016. Researchers also found that soldiers . of both genders are nervous about women entering combat jobs, but say . they are determined to do it fairly. The . study showed men are worried about losing their jobs to women and women . are worried they will be seen as getting jobs because of their gender . and not their qualifications.

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 19:59 EST, 25 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 02:22 EST, 26 February 2014 . The first night in the United States for a family of Japanese tourists ended with the parents being pulled from their rental car at gunpoint with their young son watching after their confusion about American traffic laws set off a high-speed pursuit in southern Utah. The pursuit began at 1 a.m. Saturday on Interstate 15 near the Utah-Arizona border when the couple's car was spotted going just 37 mph and swerving between lanes, said Lt. Brad Horne, Utah Highway Patrol's DUI unit commander. More than a dozen patrolmen were working the area in a special DUI operation, and Horne said he figured the car was being driven by a drunken driver. Horne turned on his lights and siren to pull the car over. Confused: A Japanese couple who'd just arrived to the US and were driving through southern Utah with their 7-year-old son when police tried to pull them over. The driver, a woman in her 40s, sped up thinking she was supposed to get out of the way of the police car . Instead of pulling over, the driver sped up to 75 mph and began driving erratically, he said. Her speeds fluctuated between 40 and 75 mph as she weaved across lanes and into the shoulder. Soon, there were three patrol cars in pursuit with other officers closing highway offramps and setting tire spikes miles ahead, Horne said. 'It was literally red and blue lights in every direction,' Horne said. The couple's car skidded to a stop about 7 miles north of where the pursuit began after three of the tires deflated after hitting the spikes. A patrolman bellowed commands from a loudspeaker in his patrol car, telling the couple to exit and walk backward. Both directions of I-15 were closed as officers prepared to encounter hardened criminals. Instead, a Japanese woman in her early 40s emerged. 'She would walk forward, backward, spin around â€” obviously she had no clue what we wanted her to do,' Horne said. Dramatic: The chase stretched over seven miles of Utah highway as police shut down exit ramps, laid out spike strips and barreled down the road in pursuit of the confused visitors . Still bracing for the worst, officers approached the car with guns drawn and pulled the woman and a man from the car. That's when they saw the couple's 7-year-old son in the backseat and realized the family didn't speak English. The boy was crying, and the parents appeared nervous and confused, Horne said. 'I think they were terrified,' he said. Realizing they were dealing with language and cultural barriers, and not a drunken driver or fugitive, officers changed their strategy, Horne said. One officer consoled the boy and reunited him with his parents as others worked to get a Japanese-speaking officer on the phone. They found one in northern Utah who spoke to the couple and learned they had arrived from Japan on Friday morning and rented a car to drive from California to Bryce Canyon in southern Utah. The woman said she had no idea what she was supposed to do when the patrolman put on his lights and siren, so she sped up to get out of the way. She kept apologizing for crashing the car, not realizing they ran over tire spikes, Horne said. Patrolmen took the family to a motel and wished them safe travels. Nobody was hurt and no cars damaged other than the flat tires, he said. About a dozen law enforcement officers were involved in some way. Authorities don't plan to pursue charges. Horne said the couple didn't have Japanese driver's licenses with them. Horne said he's encountered many tourists in his three decades working with the Utah Highway Patrol, but he's never seen a situation escalate like this. 'Red and blue lights are a pretty universal signal,' Horne said. 'Regardless of nationality and language, when we put lights on, people pull over and stop.'","Utah Highway Patrol says they intended to pull over the Japanese couple for going too slow when they suddenly sped up .

Also, police in Newton, just west of Boston and the Logan Airport, are looking into a report from a driver that a man pointed a green laser at him and other drivers on Tuesday night, about two hours before the planes were allegedly targeted.

The FAA pinpointed the coordinates to Forte Park in Newton, and police responded but did not find anyone. Police do not know if the incidents are related. While shining laser beams at planes won't cause any structural damage it could potentially blind pilots. No lasers have caused any plane crashes, but the number of reported incidents, similar to last night's, has drastically increased over the past several years.

In 2006, just 384 were reported but that number rose to 3,900 by 2013 (file photo) Shining a laser pointer into the cockpit of an aircraft is a felony. A few years ago, the Senate actually passed an amendment to make it a federal crime, that could serve offenders with a $250,000 fine and and put them behind bars for up to five years. Officials are so determined to crack down on the amount of laser incidents, the FBI has said it will pay $10,000 for information leading to a conviction in 11 cities, but that does not include Boston.","One flight was en-route to Boston, the other leaving and headed to Atlanta .

The case started when a girl from Clay High School in Green Cove Springs claiming to have had sex with a boy named Cody Williams on or around Halloween in 2012. The victim - who was under 12 but her age has not been disclosed - told investigators what the boy looked like and where he attended school, reported The Florida Times-Union. Two months later police arrested Cody Lee Williams of Green Cove Springs, who had a previous run-in with the law relating to marijuana. 'You've got the wrong guy!': Cody Lee Williams (left) was wrongly arrested for sexual battery. Cody Raymond Williams (right) is due to appear in court on the charge Monday. They are in the same year at the same school . He was jailed on a sexual battery charge, however the officers never showed a picture of him to the girl to verify the suspect. 'I can’t even tell you the horror of hearing those words,' Williams said. 'My heart just started beating really fast and all my insides just kind of dropped.' Sheriff Rick Beseler said his department makes between 7,000 and 8,000 arrests a year and that this was not a 'routine' problem. Deputy Sheriff Johnny Hawkins, who interviewed the victim and arrested Williams, will find out this week whether he will receive a 10-day suspension as punishment. Williams had called his mother from jail and told her be believed police had accused the wrong Cody Williams. Both teens attended the same school since seventh grade and were born the same year.

Finally, after being contacted by Williams' mother, Sheriff Williams got in touch with the victim and organized a photo line up. She said Cody Lee Williams was not the boy she had sex with. Williams case was expunged, however he had already been in jail a total of 35 days.

Casey Anthony refused to tell lawyers why she made up her story about Zanny The Nanny kidnapping her daughter Caylee and threatened to storm out of a new deposition released this week. The mother, who was cleared of killing her daughter in 2011, was facing fresh questions from attorneys for Zenaida Gonzalez, who is suing Anthony for defamation. Gonzalez says the similarity of her name to Zanny The Nanny meant that some people thought she was to blame for Caylee's disappearance. Hiding: Casey Anthony, pictured in March last year, has been seen little since she was acquitted of her daughter's murder in 2011 . But Anthony insisted to Gonzalez's lawyers that Zanny The Nanny was a real person and she had not made up the name as a code for the prescription drug Xanax. In the . contentious January 23 deposition, Anthony claimed that Zenaida . Fernandez-Gonzalez was someone she'd last seen in 2007 and who had baby-sat . Caylee just once. ‘I met her at Universal Studios in 2006… through a mutual friend,’ Anthony said, adding: ‘We were friends a little over a year.’ But she admitted that the real Zanny The Nanny did not kidnap Caylee, as she initially claimed after disappearance. Miss Gonzalez . sued in 2008 after Anthony claimed that a similarly-named nanny had . kidnapped two-year-old Caylee. Authorities ultimately determined the . nanny didn't exist and the girl was dead, although Anthony was eventually acquitted of murder in Caylee's death after a high-profile trial. Court battle: Zenaida Gonzalez argues her lawsuit should survive the bankruptcy because Anthony was 'willful and malicious' in damaging her reputation . In the contentious January 23 deposition, Anthony claimed that Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez, the nanny she claimed had kidnapped her daughter, was a real person . On July 5, 2011, the jury found Casey not guilty of first degree murder, aggravated child abuse, and aggravated manslaughter of a child, but guilty of four misdemeanor counts of providing false information to a law enforcement officer. The not guilty murder verdict was greeted with public outrage, and was both attacked and defended by media and legal commentators who complained that the jury had misunderstood the meaning of reasonable doubt. During the deposition, Anthony admitted she made . up the story about dropping her daughter Caylee off with the fictional . babysitter at the Sawgrass apartments in Orlando, Florida, the same . address as the woman suing her. And she admitted to lying to the police . about it. But when Gonzalez' lawyer Keith Mitnik pressed and asked . what happened to Caylee and whether she knew her child was alive or dead . at the time she claimed to have dropped her off with the fictional . babysitter, Anthony threatened to walk out. ‘At the advice of . counsel, I decline to answer questions about my daughter. If you ask me . again, I will walk out of this room,’ she said. A transcript of the two hour deposition was filed in federal court on Tuesday. Mitnik . expressed skepticism of Anthony's claim that the nanny was a . real person. ‘Now, is there any way in the world that you could . suggest to me that I might find this person to see if she ever existed?’ Mitnik asked Anthony. Anthony replied: ‘I don't know if you could or not, sir.’ Mitnik . reminded Anthony that Baez said at trial that she had difficulty . telling the truth: ‘Do you have a significant problem with not telling . the truth?’ Victim: Caylee Marie Anthony went missing in June 2008 and was found in a wooded area near her grandparents house six months later . ‘No, sir, I do not,’ Anthony replied. She also denied . that the nickname ‘Zanny the nanny’ was a reference to the knockout drug . Xanax, and that she had ever given drugs of any kind to her daughter. The . deposition was part of the ongoing legal wrangling surrounding Anthony's . Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Gonzalez argues her lawsuit should survive the . bankruptcy because Anthony was ‘willful and malicious’ in damaging her . reputation. At the crux of the suit are comments Anthony made to her . mother, Cindy, during a jailhouse visit. Anthony allegedly said she . hadn't ruled out Gonzalez as a suspect, information her mother relayed . to reporters. Anthony said she didn't . authorize her parents to represent her in the media: 'I had zero control . over that. I was in jail, Mr. Mitnik. I had no control over anything.' As the deposition neared its end, Anthony emphatically said she never blamed the woman suing her for Caylee's disappearance. 'That's . never been the case and that will never be the truth. So let's get that . straight right here and now. You can ask a hundred more ridiculous . questions. I'm not going to answer them,' she said.

Wearing a black sweatshirt with a peace sign and other symbols on it, Felton was seemingly upbeat as he appeared before Judge Diana Boyar, nodding affirmatively after he was ordered to stay away from his wife, Ariane Raymondo-Felton.

Free to play: Felton was ushered into a black SUV following his arraignment. Under the terms of his bond, Felton can travel to games . Felton had eight points and seven assists Monday in the Knicks' 110-108 loss to Dallas. The Knicks brought the point guard back for a second stint in New York in July 2012, opting to let Jeremy Lin leave, and Felton helped the Knicks win the Atlantic Division last year. But he has had a disappointing season, averaging 10.4 points and shooting 40 percent while missing 16 games with a series of injuries. He has been frequently criticized by fans as the Knicks have fallen to 21-36. Felton had allegedly stored an FN Herstal similar to this in his Upper West Side apartment since April . NBA spokesman Tim Frank said the league was monitoring the case. It could fine or suspend Felton, but usually waits until after the legal case has been resolved. The league did break from that policy . to suspend Gilbert Arenas for the remainder of the season after he . brought guns to the Washington Wizards' locker room during the 2009-10 . season. He was eventually sentenced to 30 days in a halfway house. Felton . is not the first pro athlete to run afoul of New York's strict gun . laws. Plaxico Burress was a New York Giants wide receiver when he was . arrested in 2008 after accidentally shooting himself in a Manhattan . nightclub. He served two years in prison. Fighter . Robert Guerrero was arrested at John F. Kennedy Airport last year after . he presented a locked gun box containing an unloaded handgun during . check-in.

Both pleaded guilty to attempted gun possession charges; . Lil Wayne spent about eight months in a city jail; Ja Rule served most . of a two-year prison sentence. Felton . is set to earn $3.8 million next season and has a player option that . would pay him $4 million in 2015-16.

'Our thoughts and prayers are with Harold’s wife, Erica, his children and grandchildren, and all those who loved him, who quote his work with abandon, and who hope that he received total consciousness,' the statement concluded.

'Harold Ramis made almost every movie which made me want to become a comedy director,' Apatow said. 'These films are the touchstones of our lives.'

In memorial: The small tribute left for Harold Ramis outside the Tribeca fire house where the 'Ghostbusters' movie was filmed . His final major directorial job: Ramis pictured on the set of 'Year One' with actors Jack Black (center) and Michael Cera (left) The beloved filmmaker was known for his over the top comedies with an uncommon touch.

Ramis' first major film was the raucous 1978 John Belushi comedy 'Animal . House,' which made the latter a household name and still inspires jokes . among college students decades later.

Ramis played the willing straight man. Shot to fame: Ramis rose to stardom as Dr Spengler in 'Ghostbusters' while alongside (left to right) Ernie Hudson, Dan Aykroyd and Bill Murray . 'I stopped being the zany... I learned that my thing was lobbing in great lines here and there, which would score big and keep me there on the stage,' Ramis told the Tribune years ago. That theme continued for the rest of his acting career, as he spent it either writing the punchlines for others, directing or playing the straight man. His first acting role came in 'Stripes,' a movie he wrote for Murray. But he shot to stardom starring as the geeky, science-obsessed Dr. Egon Spengler in both 'Ghostbusters' movies. Ramis never had more than bit parts after his run as Spengler was through, but his film writing legacy spans generations. He wrote and directed 1980's 'Caddyshack,' cementing both he and Mrray's place in Hollywood. They would make several more films together. 'In 1993 Harold Ramis called me & told me his 2 rules of directing comedy: '1. Hire Bill Murray 2. Turn on camera,' filmmaker Dan Mirvish tweeted upon hearing of Ramis' death.

'His . work is the reason why so many of us got into comedy,' 'Knocked Up' director Judd Apatow told the Tribune. 'We grew up on 'Second City TV' and 'Ghostbusters,' 'Vacation,' 'Animal House,' 'Stripes,' 'Meatballs,' he literally made every single one of our favorite movies.'

Former New York governor Eliot Spitzer has no qualms about hiding his new relationship with a much younger woman just weeks after his divorce was finalized. The disgraced Democrat was spotted with his girlfriend Lis Smith at Monday night's Knicks game and it seemed like the pair didn't pay much attention to the court. Spitzer, 54, and his former campaign manager Smith, 31, were seen kissing throughout the game against the Dallas Mavericks on Monday. Going public: Former governor Eliot Spitzer and his campaign manager-turned-girlfriend Lis Smith were spotted kissing throughout Monday night's Knicks game at Madison Square Garden . In the spirit: The Kicks ended up losing by two points, but that didn't stop the pair from celebrating . Not shying away: Though the former Governor wore a baseball cap with his suit and tie, they did not to try to hide their faces during the game as their relationship is very much public after they were outed in December . The once-covert couple have now clearly let go of any attempts to keep their private lives private as they put on a full display at Madison Square Garden. They cheered loudly and grabbed each other at different moments, going in for a kiss at more quiet points in the game. The former Governor paired his suit and tie with a Yankees hat – a cap from a different sport – perhaps as an attempt to fly under the radar. His girlfriend sported a similarly professional look, wearing a crisp white button-down, but opted against wearing her own baseball cap. This is not the first time that the . couple have made an appearance to support the home team, as they were . spotted going to a Knicks game last month and following the victory with . a drink-filled night at Brother Jimmy's, a bar across the street from . Madison Square Garden. The . timing of that night out was interesting as Spitzer had a meeting with . his lawyer to sign divorce papers the next morning, continuing the . formal process of separation from his wife Silda Wall. Together: Smith worked as Spitzer's comptroller campaign manager and they reportedly started dating after he lost- but while he was still legally married to his wife Silda . Consequences: After the news broke, she was no longer considered a candidate for the top spot as Bill de Blasio's press secretary . Their latest trip to a basketball game marked a different kind of milestone for the couple, as Ms. Smith has continued to put herself out into the public sphere but for more political reasons . After running Spitzer's failed 'comeback' campaign to become New York City's new comptroller, Smith joined Bill de Blasio's team and was widely considered to be the likely candidate for the mayor's press secretary. Just as the final staffing decision was due to be made, photos were released that showed the former governor, who resigned years ago after admitting to soliciting prostitutes, sneaking in and out of Smith's apartment in December. Now after spending almost two months under the radar, Smith is starting to actively try to restart her consulting career. She . is now working for the Democratic Governor's Association, paying close . attention to Governor Martin O'Malley of Maryland who is considered a . possible 2016 candidate should Hillary Clinton choose not to run for . president. Thrill of the game: This is the second time in as many months that Spitzer and Smith have been seen at Knicks games together . Rough call: Smith, 31, has written about how she was surprised by all of the female commentators who had a problem with her dating Spitzer, 54, who infamously had to resign from office after his trysts with prostitutes . On Sunday, Smith even made the surprising decision to pen an op-ed blasting her former boss' plans to pay for universal pre-K in New York City by taxing the city's rich. 'While de Blasio won the mayoral election in a walk, and earned his landslide with a bold platform of taxing the rich to expand pre-K, his heady victory obscured a stubborn fact: The power to decide this issue doesn’t reside in Gracie Mansion. It resides in Albany,' she wrote in the New York Daily News. Her op-ed was matched up against one written by Chirlaine McCray, Bill de Blasio's wife. 'At this point, de Blasio should stop spending political capital on a losing fight, declare victory by taking Cuomo up on his offer of a blank check, and focus on running the city,' Smith wrote. 'For those who still have their money on de Blasio in this heavyweight matchup, I suggest moving it over to Cuomo – fast.'","The former New York governor and his girlfriend Lis Smith were spotted at Madison Square Garden Monday night .

And she's even been bitten a few times but none of the snakes are venomous - and courageous Krista says it doesn't hurt. She said: 'I'm never afraid of snakes, not even a little bit. I'm crazy for them.' Krista, the eldest of three children, was first introduced to the animals by father Jamie, 33, who is a snake specialist. And she held her first when she was just two years old. Mr Guarino said: 'Snake was one of her first ever words. I knew when she was very little that they were going to be her passion. 'From an early age she wasn't like a normal kid - she wasn't afraid of snakes at all. She just wants to go up and grab them and pet them and play with them.' During the summer holidays Krista helps her father out at their local reptile house. And isn't afraid to play, train and handle any snake. She even helps to feed the alligators.

'These people are really ignorant about snakes. My daughter is never in any danger. This is what Krista loves and I don't want to deprive her of that. 'She is really smart and knows which snakes are safe and which aren't. She really understands them and handles them like a responsible adult would. I don't worry about her at all. 'It's fascinating to watch her with them - she's so comfortable with them. I sometimes can 't believe that my young daughter is so incredible with the animals.' He added: 'Unfortunately snakes have a very bad reputation and I'm trying to get it across to people that they're not as bad as they're made out to be. They're not monsters.' Krista has already set her sights on opening her own reptile zoo when she's older. And she's determined to change perceptions about the misunderstood snake.

Mark Zuckerberg and WhatsApp founder Jan Koum last night showed Korean popstar Psy how to Party - Facebook style. The party at Barcelona's Boujis restaurant, the sister restaurant of the London haunt that is a favourite of the young royals, was to celebrate signing the contract for the $19 billion sale of Whatsapp to Facebook and the 29th birthday of Zuckerberg's wife, Priscilla Chan. Also invited to the celebration was Korean, Park Jae-Sang, better know as Psy, the singer of the hit song Gangnam Style. The party at Barcelona's Boujis restaurant was to celebrate signing the contract for the $19 billion sale of Whatsapp to Facebook and the 29th birthday of Zuckerberg's wife, Priscilla Chan. Over 450 million people using the service each month . Firm has 50 employees . 70% of those people active on a given day . Messaging volume approaching the entire global telecom SMS volume . Service adds more than 1 million new registered users per day . 600m photos uploaded each day . 200m voice messages sent each day . Priscilla received a bunch of Roses and a cake from Mark for her birthday as the couple left the restaurant and got into a heavily guarded chauffeur driven people carrier. The party came just hours after Zuckerberg and Koum addressed the Mobile World Congress conference. Zuckrberg discussed long-term plans for a world in which everyone is able to get online during an on-stage interview at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain on Monday. The company's mobile footprint has only expanded with its decision to buy WhatsApp, the wildly popular smartphone messaging service, in a surprise deal announced last Wednesday. While Zuckerberg spent most of his time discussing Internet.org, the ambitious project that aims to get the world online, he couldn't skirt questions about Facebook's decision to pay a staggering $19 billion for WhatsApp. 'WhatsApp is a great company and a great fit for us,' Zuckerberg said, calling the service the ""most engaging' mobile application that has ever existed - and one that's well worth its price. With 465 million monthly members, the service is growing at a faster pace than Facebook ever has and Zuckerberg believes WhatsApp is on track to reach a billion users. It's because of that potential, and not WhatsApp's current revenue stream, that Zuckerberg thinks WhatsApp is worth more than $19 billion. In comparison, Twitter Inc. which has 241 million users, is worth roughly $32 billion, based on its stock price Monday. Even so, Facebook investors shouldn't expect a windfall from WhatsApp any time soon. Zuckerberg said the acquisition will allow the startup to focus on growing its user base - and not on making money - over the next five years or so. Mark Zuckerberg and wife Priscilla Chan leave the party is a heavily guarded car . WhatsApp co-founder Jan Koum met last night with Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and their respective girlfriends, at Boujois Restaurant in Barcelona, where Psy also attended . New billioaire Jan Koum leaves the party . That echoes earlier comments from WhatsApp CEO Jan Koum at the wireless show. Koum, who announced that WhatsApp will soon offer voice calling as it works to lure more users to its service, stressed that his company has no plans to add 'marketing' or advertising to the service and that its staff of 55 is unlikely to grow much. 'We want to operate as a startup,' Koum said. Though they've known each other for years, Zuckerberg and Koum worked out the Facebook-WhatsApp deal in the 11 days before it was announced last Wednesday. Zuckerberg said that it wasn't until the pair got aligned on the vision for Internet.org and getting everyone in the world connected that they started talking about combining their companies. Relatively unknown until now in the U.S., WhatsApp is popular in other countries, both in Europe and in emerging economies. Koum and co-founder Brian Acton, both former Yahoo engineers, started the company five years ago. Also invited to the celebration, was Korean, Park Jae-Sang, PSY singer of hit song Gangnam Style. Korean star Psy arrives at the party at Bouijis in Barcelona . Unlike Facebook, WhatsApp eschews advertising and instead charges people 99 cents a year after the first year to use the service. On the surface, Facebook and WhatsApp appear to hold divergent views on a number of matters, but Zuckerberg said the companies share a common vision in making the world more connected. Some 70 percent of world's population, or 5 billion people, are still without Internet access. And access, Zuckerberg said, is growing slower than many people in the Internet-connected world believe. When he announced Internet.org last summer, Zuckerberg noted that since the wealthiest members of the world's population are already connected to the Internet, getting the next billions online is unlikely to be profitable any time soon, if ever. Mark Zuckerberg leaving Boujis with wife Priscilla Chan - who received a cake and roses for her 29th birthday . On Monday, Zuckerberg acknowledged that he 'can't construct a model' in which Internet.org's efforts will be profitable for Facebook in the near future. 'I think we are probably going to lose money on this for quite a while,' he said, though he added that over time there will likely be some benefit to Facebook. Judging by Facebook's stock price, investors seem confident in Zuckerberg's long-term view. On Monday, Facebook's shares hit in midday trading, $71.44, their highest level ever.","Party just hours after pair addressed Mobile World Congress .

A group of Danish teenagers filmed a boy and a girl posing as a boyfriend abusing his partner to see if ‘the man on the street’ would intervene. The experiment follows on from the viral video showing a freezing boy at a Norwegian bus stop where a majority of people offered up their clothes for the shivering child. However, the Danish were not as kind as their Scandinavian neighbours when it came to a young woman being subjected to threats and violence. Scroll down for video . Social experiment: Two Danish teenagers staged domestic abuse on the streets and in the parks of Copenhagen to see if people would intervene - the results were disappointing . The four-minute video was shot around Copenhagen by local 18-year-olds Arian Kashef and Emil Behrndtz on Valentine’s Day. Mr Kashef was filmed in several locations, in a park and on busy streets, pretending to mentally and pysically abuse their friend Soraya, posing as his ’girlfriend’. Shockingly, it is not until a minute into the video that a lone man interrupts the experiment when se sees Mr Kashef grabbing and slapping his ‘partner’ on a park bench. Before this, a group of young women, stronger than Mr Kashef in numbers, are filmed walking past the ‘arguing couple', and although they look, they do nothing. In the video, Mr Kashef can be heard shouting things such as ‘You know what you've done!’, I’m going to kill you!’ and ‘Are you not listening to what I’m telling you?!’ while also being physically abusive against his pretend partner.

Exposing the truth: Arian Kashef and Emil Behrndtz, both 18, filmed the video on Valentine's Day where Mr Kashef pretended to abuse his 'girlfriend', a friend of theirs, in public . In the description on their YouTube page the pair explains: . ‘This experiment was filmed on Valentine’s Day as this day represents love between two people. ‘Unfortunately, not all live in a healthy relationship, but rather one in which they are subjected to violence. ‘We wanted to see how people here in Denmark would react to a young lady being threatened and subjected to physical violence.’ Mr Kashef who runs YouTube channel ArianPlanet with Mr Behrndtz, said a majority of people who stopped him were women. ‘A quarter of witnesses helped out, a majority of which were younger women,’ Mr Kashef told MailOnline. ‘There were also a lot of older women who said something, but did not physically confront me, which is understandable. ‘I don't think this behaviour is specific for Denmark, I think people across Western society are scared of taking responsibility. ‘Personally I think we have a responsibility to stop this, like myself and Emil Behrndtz for example, we are just two teenagers who do these videos for no financial benefit, just in hope of changing the way people think.’ Hero: A lone man intervenes in a park, and pushes the 'boyfriend' away from the girl .

'I will never make this mistake again,' he continued. 'I know it's too late to fix... but I wanted you to know how embarrassed and truly sorry myself and my crew are.'

In the complaint, Mr Iqbal said: 'The video is considered as highly controversial to its viewers as a result of its portrayal of blasphemy.

Northern Ireland Peter Robinson threatened to resign if the UK government refuses to order a judicial inquiry into the blunders . Northern Ireland's First Minister dramatically threatened to quit today din protest at the collapse of the Hyde Park bomb trial. Peter Robinson said he had been left in the dark about a catalogue of appalling blunders by police and prosecutors which saw one of the alleged bombers John Downey walk free from court. He condemned the 'despicable' way the UK government had behaved and demanded an urgent judicial inquiry into how letters were sent to scores of suspects telling them they were not wanted by police. Downey, 62, was arrested last year and was due to stand trial for the July 1982 nail bomb atrocity which killed four Household Cavalry soldiers and seven horses and injured 31 people. Another horse, Sefton, survived and became a national hero. But convicted IRA terrorist Downey was told yesterday that he would not face prosecution because of a letter – dubbed a ‘get-out-of-jail-free card’ – mistakenly sent to him saying he was not wanted by police. The letter was sent in July 2007, when Tony Blair was Prime Minister, assuring him he was not wanted for any offence despite a warrant for his arrest existing since May 29, 1983. The case has created a major stand-off between Belfast and London, with the Westminster government refusing to take the matter any further. Issuing his threat to resign, Mr Robinson said: ‘I am not prepared to be the First Minister of a government that has found itself having salient facts relevant to matters that are devolved hidden from them. ‘That is not acceptable to me. I want to have a full judicial inquiry into who knew what, when they knew it and exactly what they did know at the time. ‘I also want to ensure that the letters that have been sent out are rescinded. First Minister Peter Robinson . 'The despicable way that the government has treated the institutions in Northern Ireland shows that they don't uphold the institutions in Northern Ireland.' In the House of Commons, David Cameron condemned the 'dreadful mistake' of the letter being sent to Mr Downey. But signalled that the decision to release Downey would not be overturned. The Prime Minister told MPs: 'We should be absolutely clear - the man should never have received the letter that he received, Downey. 'It was a dreadful mistake and a mistake that we now need to have a rapid factual review to make sure that this cannot happen again. 'But, whatever happens, we have to stick to the principle that we are a country and a government under the rule of law.' Convicted IRA member:John Downey, 62, of County Donegal, walked free from court after being given a letter by the Blair government telling him he was not wanted by policy. Prime Minister David Cameron condemned the letter as a 'dreadful mistake' Explosion: A detachment of the Queen's Household Cavalry lay dead, victims of a concealed car bomb detonated in London's Hyde Park . Defence Minister Anna Soubry, a former barrister, said she could understand why Mr Robinson was 'very angry' but there was no chance of a judicial review. She told BBC Radio 4's World At One: 'He can't get a judicial review, with the best will in the world. 'You can't judicially review the decision. You can appeal it, the prosecution can appeal it. Dominic Grieve has made it clear the CPS has taken the view that these are not the right circumstances to appeal it. 'So, with great respect to Peter Robinson, who is quite right to be very angry, absolutely right to be angry, but we are in a very, very unpleasant, bad situation and, unfortunately, I cannot see any way back from where we are now.' Defence minister Anna Soubry . Later Attorney General Dominic Grieve repeatedly rejected emotional pleas to reopen the case. He told MPs: ‘John Anthony Downey was arrested on 19 May 2013 at Gatwick Airport where he was en route to Greece. ‘On his arrest he produced a letter stating that he was free to enter the jurisdiction without fear of arrest. Despite that letter he was charged by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) with four counts of murder. ‘Before he was charged my consent was sought, as the law requires, for him to face a charge of causing an explosion. I gave that consent. ‘I believed then that it was right to do so and I remain of the same view today.’ He insisted the scheme under which the letter was issued did not amount to an amnesty, adding: ‘Can I firstly make the point that it's clear from the judgment and the supporting material that the administrative scheme was not and never could be an amnesty?’ However MPs lined up to condemn what is seen as a ‘monumental’ blunder. Two of the four victims: The families of . Household Cavalry soldiers Anthony 'Denis' Daly (left) and Roy Bright . (right) said they 'never ceased in their desire to see that justice be . done' Deaths: Simon Tipper (left) and Jeffrey Young (right), the other two soldiers killed in the bombing in 1982 . Laurence Robertson, Conservative chairman of the Northern Ireland select committee, said called for the name of person who authorised the scheme to be made public and suggested it may have come from Mr Blair himself. He said: ‘Surely that must have been the prime minister of the time?’ Mr Robertson also questioned the role of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), which gave assurances to Mr Downey that he was not being pursued by any police force in the United Kingdom. Nearly 200 suspected IRA terrorists on the run have received  similar letters, effectively granting them an amnesty under a deal by Mr Blair and Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams. Families of the victims of the Hyde Park bombing said they felt ‘devastatingly let down’ by ‘catastrophic failures’ and called for a review of the ‘comfort letters’ issued to IRA suspects. In a statement, the relatives of Corporal Roy Bright, 36, Lieutenant Anthony Daly, 23, Trooper Simon Tipper and Lance Corporal Jeffrey Young, both 19, who were slain when a bomb packed with 30lbs of nails exploded as the Blues and Royals rode to the Changing of the Guard ceremony, said: ‘It is with great sadness and bitter  disappointment that we have received the full and detailed  judgment and that a trial will now not take place. ‘This news has left us all feeling devastatingly let down, even more so when the monumental blunder behind this judgment lies at the feet of the Police Service of Northern Ireland. ‘The end result is that the opportunity for the full chain of those terrible events will never be put in the public domain for justice to be seen to be done.’ Judith Jenkins, 52, the widow of L/Cpl Young, added: ‘It’s the cruellest injustice. For 32 years we have waited for justice. ‘We all had our hopes raised and this has been a total shock. It’s absolutely staggering how many blunders have happened in this case.

'Jihadist hearts are bleeding': Al Qaeda chief Ayman al-Zawahri (pictured) has called on militant rebel factions seeking to overthrow President Assad in Syria to stop fighting each other . An Al Qaeda leader has called on militant rebel factions in Syria to stop fighting each other and set up a judicial committee to sort out their differences, according to an audio recording released on Islamist websites. The small but powerful Al Qaeda-linked Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) has been caught up in clashes with other Islamist insurgents in recent weeks, often triggered by disputes over authority and territory. In a five-minute recording, Al Qaeda chief Ayman al-Zawahri said: 'Our hearts and the hearts of the (Muslim) nation, which hangs its hopes on you, have bled for the infighting that has spread between the ranks of those waging jihad for Islam. 'We call on all our brothers in all the jihadist groups... to work towards ending this sedition, which will lead to only God knows what.' The recording emerged as international peace talks on Syria looked close to collapse yesterday after a furious clash over President Assad's future. Reuters news agency was unable independently to confirm the authenticity of the recording, but the voice bore a clear resemblance to that of Zawahri. The insurgent groups fighting ISIL range from relatively secular moderates to Islamists, including the Al Qaeda-aligned Jabhat al-Nusra, in the worst rebel-on-rebel violence since Syria's conflict began in March 2011. In April, the head of ISIL, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi tried to merge ISIL with Jabhat al-Nusra, defying orders from Zawahri and causing a rift. The fighting since the start of January has killed more than 1,000 people, according to Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitors. The fissures within rebel ranks have helped President Bashar al-Assad's forces claw back territory around the northern commercial hub of Aleppo.

Disparate: The insurgent groups fighting ISIL range from relatively secular moderates to Islamists . About 130,000 people have been killed and a quarter of Syrians driven from their homes in the civil war, which began with peaceful protests against 40 years of Assad family rule and has descended into a sectarian conflict, with the opposing sides armed and funded by Sunni Arab states and Shi'ite Iran. High-level mediating has yielded little so far, but Lakhdar Brahimi, the UN mediator who is meeting separately today with each Syrian delegation, said there are signs they might be willing to bend on humanitarian aid, ceasefires and prisoner exchanges. Amid hostile exchanges at the peace talks . in Switzerland, Syria’s government ridiculed demands by opposition . leaders and their Western backers including Britain for Assad to stand . down, saying it would never happen. At another Swiss venue, the World Economic Forum in Davos, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani called today for a new election in Syria, saying his nation would respect the results.

An armoury of 13 giant pumps used to stop low-lying Holland from being overwhelmed by the North Sea has been shipped in to help stricken communities submerged on the Somerset Levels. The machinery is being used to divert water from the River Tone and River Parrett, which burst their banks and left homes and businesses under water since Christmas. Eight of the pumps were installed at Dunball and five at Beerwall, near Bridgwater, and they can shift more than seven million tons of water every day - enough to fill Wembley Stadium to the brim seven times. It came as forecasters warned that almost two weeks' rain is expected to fall in parts of Britain by the end of today. Protection: 13 pumps used to protect Holland from flooding have been brought in to help drain submerged parts of the Somerset Levels . Powerful: This machinery at Dunball, near Bridgwater in Somerset is helping shift seven million tons of water a day from rivers and fields . Teeming: The water is being moved to alleviate stress on the swollen River Tone and River Parrett, whose high levels has caused chaos and misery in the South West . Process: The 13 pumps are being used to reduce levels in the Bridgwater area of Somerset.  The eight pumps at Dunball have been pulling water out of the King Sedgemoor Drain - where it meets the River Parrett, left. The five pumps at Aller are shifting water from the Parrett into the reduced River Sowy, right . Pockets of northern England, Wales and Scotland can expect up to 40mm of rain today - with isolated patches of moorland high above sea level expected to get up to 80mm of rain during that time. The average rainfall for much of the country during February stands at just less than 100mm, meaning the overnight downpour will represent almost half that total in just a few hours. But it is not expected to compare with the sorts of rainfall which have caused havoc in parts of southern England in the last two months, where homes have been evacuated and transport networks brought to their knees as flood water surged. Met Office forecaster Krista Mitchell said a band of rain was heading over England, Wales and Scotland but would fragment by lunchtime today. 'The heaviest rainfall will be over the highest ground. People can expect 30-40mm - up to 80mm on higher ground - the average being 98mm for the month of February.' To alleviate flooding in Somerset the pumps are moving water from swollen rivers, to trenches or other waterways with much lower levels. All the pumps are designed to speed up the flow of water. The eight pumps at Dunball have been pulling water out of the King Sedgemoor Drain - where it meets the River Parrett north of Bridgwater - for around a week. This is designed to increase the capacity of both the King Sedgemoore Drain and the River Parrett. The five pumps at Aller are shifting water from the Parrett into the reduced River Sowy lowering water levels where the Parrett and River Tone meet. The Monks Leaze Clyce sluice gate - north west of Langport - has been opened gradually since Saturday. It is hoped this will divert water away from the Parrett and into the newly-reduced Rover Sowy and out to the sea. Relief: Eight of the pumps have been installed at Dunball and five are at Beerwall, near Bridgwater . Cascade of water: The pumps are moving millions of tons daily but experts believe that the Somerset floods will take several more months to dissipate . Powerful: The phenomenal pumping effort is finally reducing flooding on the drenched Somerset Levels - thanks to a helping hand from Holland . Forecast: The Met Office has said that a fortnight's rain could fall in the coming 24 hours before more sunshine and showers on Thursday . The forecaster said there would be some showers heading into the week, with strong winds, but would not compare with the conditions earlier in February. National Farmers Union president Peter Kendall called for greater priority to be put on flood defences to protect agricultural land. Flood risk: The Environment AGency has reduced the number of areas where flooding is posing a risk to life but large areas are still under water . Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme at the opening of the NFU's national conference in Birmingham, Mr Kendall said: 'We have to put lives and human safety first, but we have to put a higher priority on agricultural land as well. 'We have turned our waterways into wildlife habitats and we have stopped clearing them. For people to say that a fallen tree is a way of managing water is ludicrous. 'We have to look at the example of Holland, where dykes have been maintained, they dredge, and they protect two-thirds of their country. We have to put a higher value on it, because 58% of our very best agricultural land lies underneath a five-metre contour, and that's what's going to feed our country in the future.' He added: 'For those farmers who are under water it's been devastating, and particularly for those farmers in Somerset who've now had these back-to-back years of losing all their income, it will be devastating.' However, Mr Kendall painted a positive picture of the health of farming outside the flooded areas, saying its contribution to the UK economy had grown by 54 per cent over the past five years. 'It is not a big area of the UK that's inundated with water. Our wheat plantings will be up, because 2012 and 2013 saw poor harvests, and actually dairy prices are on the way up as well. So despite the floods, which for the farmers affected are devastating, generally the health of British agriculture is pretty positive,' said Mr Kendall. 'I know we are small - less than 1 per cent of GDP - but if you take a 54 per cent increase, that's significant and the more other parts of the economy that can grow like that, we will all be smiling. 'We believe agriculture produces the raw materials for the biggest manufacturing sector of the economy and we don't believe government really understands the food economy is to the wider economy.' Mr Rooke told the Today programme: 'We've still got a massive amount of water in Somerset that we are still pumping out in the largest pumping operation that we've ever undertaken. We've still got homes flooded from groundwater. And we are still repairing defences as fast as we can.' Aerial views of the flooded Somerset Levels, which has suffered unprecedented flooding caused by a series of relentlessly violent Atlantic storms . Asked how soon dredging will begin in Somerset, he said: 'We announced last week that we've let a contract to start dredging, the Government has provided the money, so we are keen to get going and we will be looking to do the work as soon as it's safe to do so.' Mr Rooke was questioned about whether the UK should follow the Netherlands in adopting techniques such as amphibious homes, building homes on stilts and flooding some areas of land to protect others. He replied: 'I think we will need to consider all of those. There are a few examples in the UK of homes on stilts, but they are very isolated. 'What we need to do is learn from across the world, and indeed the world learns from our experiences, particularly in terms of the flood mapping we do and the flood warning systems we have in place. 'We certainly need to be managing the environment as a whole and looking at how we can cope with these extremes of weather, and I think 2012 was a really good example where for 25 per cent of the year the Environment Agency was busy with others managing a drought and for the rest of the year it was busy, with others, managing serious flooding.' Drying out: The waters which covered Worcestershire Cricket Club's ground had finally receded today . Recovery: The pristine pitch at the New Road Stadium had been covered in flood water . Damage: Luckily for the Worcestershire CCC authorities there is still the best part of four months until the start of the season but the volume of water will have had lasting effects . Home and dry: The water has now subsided, after levels reached such heights that some of the seats were submerged . Clear up duty: Steve Gravenall, one of the ground staff, washes the floor down in the club's machine shed . Scene: Less than a fortnight ago the ground was submerged after the River Severn, which runs close to the club burst its banks . Soaked: Torrential storms and unceasing rain provided an arena better suited to hosting a sailing championships rather than county cricket games .

Convicted IRA member John Downey, 62, walked free from court after it emerged he was one of 187 terror suspects who have a letter giving immunity from prosecution . The secret deal that let suspected Hyde Park bomber John Downey walk free from court means that 187 IRA terror suspects will now be off the hook, too. Downey was just one of 200 suspected terrorists, known as 'On The Runs' or OTRs, sent a letter guaranteeing that they would not face arrest or have to stand trial if they returned to the UK. Other high-profile terrorism suspects thought likely to have similar letters include Maze Prison escapees and three IRA members wanted in connection with murders of British soldiers. Today Prime Minister David Cameron described the actions that led to the collapse of the Downey trial as a 'dreadful mistake', while Northern Ireland First Minister Peter Robinson indicated he was prepared to resign unless there was a judicial inquiry into the trial's collapse. He said: 'I have to say quite frankly that I am not prepared to be the first minister of a government that is kept in the dark on matters that are relevant to what we are doing.' Meanwhile Attorney General Dominic Grieve stood by his decision to allow the prosecution to go ahead in the first place and said the allegations faced by Downey were 'of the utmost seriousness'. The effective amnesty for the fugitives was granted in a secret deal between Tony Blair's Labour government and Sinn Fein as they worked towards a peace deal in Northern Ireland. The Old Bailey heard how Blair, the then Northern Ireland secretary Peter Mandelson, and Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams conducted secret negotiations to deal with the OTRs - an issue said to be a crucial stumbling block to the decommissioning of weapons. Under the project known as 'the administrative scheme', an estimated 200 suspected IRA fugitives were sent letters by the Police Service Northern Ireland (PSNI) assuring them they were free from potential prosecution, despite there being outstanding warrants against them. The court judgement revealed that in 2000 there were an estimated 200 On The Runs, and allowing for those who have died in the 14 years since, it suggests that possibly every IRA member on the run has a letter like Downey's, which he received in 2007. Sinn Fein politician Gerry Kelly told the Old Bailey in Downey's trial: 'It is impossible to overstate the importance of the assurances given to the 187 recipients, which included John Downey, being maintained. 'These were essential in the achievement of the series of agreements that began with the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, and were consolidated in... the commencement of the Northern Ireland Assembly in 2007', the Belfast News Letter reported. Downey, a convicted member of the IRA, was on the list of OTRs because of his suspected involvement in the 1982 Hyde Park bombing that killed four Household Cavalry soldiers and four horses and left 31 others injured. Letter of immunity? Sinn Fein general secretary Rita O'Hare, pictured with Gerry Adams, went on the run after she was arrested in connection with the murder of British soldier Frazer Paton . Terror attack: Four soldiers and seven horses were killed by the Hyde Park bomb in the summer of 1982 . He became a suspect three weeks after the attack on 20 July, when his fingerprints were found on parking tickets in the stolen car used in the bombing, but denied responsibility for the attack. Lieutenant Anthony Daly, 23, Tropper Simon Tipper, 19, Lance Corporal Jeffrey Young, 19, and Squadron Quartermaster Corporal Roy Bright, 36, all of the Blues and Royal, died in the attack as they rode from their barracks at Knightsbridge to Horse Guards Parade when a bomb packed with 30lbs of nails went off. Other IRA fugitives likely to have been sent letters reassuring them they would not be prosecuted include Kevin Barry Artt, PÃ³l Brennan, and Terrence Kirby, three of the 'H-Block four' who escaped from the notorious Maze Prison in Northern Ireland in 1983. They fled to the US, from where they have resisted extradition attempts. In September 1983 38 prisoners broke out of the notorious Maze prison in Northern Ireland - some of those who are still on the run may be in possession of a letter giving them amnesty from prosecution . Victim: Captain Robert Nairac of the Grenadier Guards, pictured in beret, was murdered by the IRA in 1977 . Sinn Fein general secretary Rita O'Hare, who was arrested in Northern Ireland in 1972 for the attempted murder of British Army officer Frazer Paton, has been on the run since fleeing when she was released on bail and is suggested as one of the highest profile people likely to have been given secret amnesty. And Patrick Maguire and Terry McCormick, wanted in connection with the murder of British Army officer Robert Nairac in May 1977, are also names believed to be on the list. Captain Nairac, 28,was abducted from a pub in Co Armagh and killed by the provisional IRA.  His body has never been found but he was awarded the George Cross posthumously in 1979. Today a Sinn Fein spokesman refused to talk about the names of those who have letters of immunity and told MailOnline it was a 'personal issue'. He said: 'It's a personal issue for those involved. I don't want to be listening to any names. I don't want to hear any names.' Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister, left, said the news about the secret amnesty revealed 'the rotten skulduggery behind the peace process', while Attorney General Dominic Grieve, right, who said he stood by his decision to prosecute Downey, was due to answer MPs questions on the collapsed trial this afternoon . It emerged today that Attorney General Dominic Grieve would answer MPs' questions after Downey's trial collapsed because of a blunder described by victims' relatives as 'monumental'. Tewkesbury Tory MP Laurence Robertson, who chairs the Northern Ireland select committee, has been granted an urgent question on the matter by Speaker John Bercow, to take place after Prime Minister's Questions this afternoon. In a written statement ahead of the Commons' proceedings, Mr Grieve said: 'Before he was charged my consent was sought, as the law requires, for him to face a charge of causing an explosion. I gave that consent. 'I believed then that it was right to do so and I remain of the same view today. 'The allegations faced by Mr Downey were of the utmost seriousness. The bombing was an attempt by the Provisional IRA to bring their terrorist campaign to London and to attack armed forces personnel who were on ceremonial duties. 'Whatever the circumstances in which the letter had been sent, and it is now clear that its assurances were wrongly given, it is right that the matter should be tested in court. 'Neither I nor the CPS were prepared to accept that the letter and the circumstances in which it had been given were such as to automatically prevent Mr Downey's prosecution.' Northern Ireland First Minister Peter Robinson said the collapse of Downey's trial yesterday was 'an outrage' After news of the letters granting immunity emerged yesterday, relatives of the four soldiers killed in the 1982 Hyde Park terror attack said in a statement: 'It is with great sadness and bitter disappointment that we have received the full and detailed judgement and that a trial will now not take place. 'This news has left us all feeling devastatingly let down, even more so when the monumental blunder behind this judgement lies at the feet of the Police Service of Northern Ireland.' Northern Ireland chief constable Matt Baggott apologised to the families, saying: 'I deeply regret these failings, which should not have happened.' Stormont First Minister Peter Robinson said yesterday's decision was 'an outrage', adding that it was 'a sad day for victims of terrorism', while TUV leader Jim Allister said it showed 'the rotten skulduggery behind the peace process'. Downey has declined to comment.","John Downey's trial collapsed because he had a letter giving him secret immunity from prosecution, despite an outstanding warrant against him .

And now scientists believe they have finally solved the mystery of why the small burrowing rodents put on such a noisy and enthusiastic show that sees them throwing their paws in the air with a squeak. Black-tailed prairies dogs use ‘jump-yip’ displays that resemble a Mexican wave to gauge how reliable their neighbours are at looking out for predators and to stop them being eaten, according to new research. Scroll down for video . Black-tailed prairies dogs use 'jump-yip' displays (pictured) that resemble a Mexican wave to gauge how reliable their neighbours are at looking out for predators and to stop them being eaten. In the display, the rodents jolt upright, throw their heads back and paws up while making a 'wee-oo' sound . In the display, the rodents jolt upright, throw their heads back and paws up while making a ‘wee-oo’ sound. Biologists at the University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, said the animals, which are native to the grasslands of North America, use the displays to work out how responsive their neighbours are to the threat of predators, such as crows, hawks and coyotes. The burrowing rodents create mounds (pictured) which they use as look-out posts. Scientists had thought that the 'jump-yip' display was an elaborate 'all clear' signal, but Professor Hare and his colleagues noticed that the animals still made the noise when there were potential predators around . Professor James Hare from the department . of biological sciences at the university, said the animals are . effectively testing the levels of vigilance of their colony and adjust . their behaviour according to how much they can rely on their neighbours’ awareness of potential predators in their environment. The displays are contagious, resulting in a ripple of 'jump-yip' movements . He also said the displays are contagious, resulting in a ripple of ‘jump-yip’ movements. ‘This fits beautifully with work on primates, including humans, which suggests that contagious displays – like yawning – provide a window into the mind of others, suggesting of course, that species probing the minds of others are aware that they are distinct from those individuals. That is to say, they are consciously aware,’ Professor Hare said. ‘Prairie dogs foraged less when individuals were less responsive to their jump-yip display, suggesting they use jump-yips to actively probe the awareness of their neighbours,’ he added. Before this study, published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B, scientists had thought that the display was an elaborate ‘all clear’ signal, to tell a colony it is safe from predators. But Professor Hare and his colleagues noticed that the animals still made the noise when there were potential predators around. Now the team’s research claims to have resolved decades of speculation as to what function these unique visual and auditory displays serve among prairie dogs. The findings suggest another way that sociality allows animals to forage effectively in the face of high predation risk, taking into account not only the number of individuals above ground within their social group, but their current state of awareness, Professor Hare explained.","Biologists at the University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, said the burrowing rodents use the 'jump-yip' display to stop them being eaten .

Not as much as you might think, depending on where you want to buy. A British real-estate site has revealed how much property you get for your million across the UK. A luxury cottage in Scotland a converted church in Manchester or a one bedroom apartment in Covent Garden - geography seems to be the key to how much luxury pad you can purchase for £1,000,000. £1 million could see you living in this property in Covent Garden, a reasonable sized flat with a kitchen nook, and a separate bathroom and bedroom. Alternately you could buy a mansion elsewhere . The living room in the Covent Garden property does boast a lot of living room space due to the smaller size of the kitchen, and has room for its own small dining table . Bit of a squeeze: The kitchen in the Covent Garden flat is a little on the small side, sacrificing the space of the kitchen for having a more open plan living room . The bathroom clearly utilises an extensive use of mirrors to give it the impression of more space. The bathroom features a small sink, bath and toilet with tiled walls . The bedroom has enough room to fit a bed and two small bedside tables, as well as a chest of drawers. The entire flat is more based around location than space . The Covent Garden flat sacrifices space for the convenience and location that the streets of London can provide . £1 million will buy you just a one bedroom apartment in the heart of . Covent Garden, Crown Court, in between Bow Street and Drury Lane. The flat comprises a combined living and dining room, separate kitchen, good size bedroom and large bathroom. Alternately, if you move to Manchester you can . purchase a unique 9 storey apartment in based in St George's Church, . Castlefield, which covers the entire square footage of the clock tower. 2500 sq ft of unique accomodation comes with a gym, sauna, and roof terrace on the top of the clock tower. The entire Gothic church and all of its new mod cons are available to buy for a small £1 million, the same price that could get you a 20 room property elsewhere . The church property: The dining room clearly shows the arches of the church design, with modern features such as glass tiled flooring and spot lighting . The converted Gothic church in Manchester is significantly more opulent than what one could afford in London . The kitchen of the church property, which features a glass tiled roof. The kitchen can be viewed from the dining room above it through the glass, and vice-versa . The bedroom of the church property seems takes design risks such as a raised and sunken bed, in order to be more appealing to the buyer . £1 million properties: The size of properties worth £1 million would appear to change depending on how far they are from cities. Smaller properties are based in or near cities, like the property in London, while larger properties can be based in the peace and quiet of the country, like the Scottish property . In Bangor, North Wales, £1million would get you this idyllic five bed, three-story, detached house in the hills. The converted Edwardian house's glass . windows boasts views over the water to Anglesey - there is a luxurious . wood burner in the living room and double doors looking out over the . water. The living room of the Bangor property, which boasts riverside views, as well as views of a bridge further down the river. The house seems like a new build and has several different mod cons that reflect this . The property also features a large garden and deck that looks out over a harbour near Anglesey . The north Wales property also features its own route to the riverside, and a small rock jetty that protrudes from the hillside . The bedroom in the north Wales property has it's own little balcony, and dwarfs other smaller properties, being almost double the size as bedrooms in flats and houses in London . The property features a few spare rooms that can be used for multiple functions. The advertiser has decided to opt for a pool table in an attempt to re-purpose it as a rec room . The north Wales property features many rooms, but most have a view of the river, or architecturally significant bridge a short way down the river . You can always tell the size of a place immediately by the size of its entrance and hallway. This one is massive, which makes it likely that so is the house . In Kinross-shire in Scotland you can snap up a 20-room state-of-the-art four bed cottage. The detached family villa with a 4-car . garage and staff flat is within easy reach of Edinburgh and has a three . acre woodland to the north of the house. A property in Kinross-shire in Scotland features 20 rooms, one of which is a classically Scottish wooden snooker room that looks over the large amount of land that comes with the property . Larch cottage in Scotland also boasts a small wooded area to the rear of the property, as well as a bird cage and several acres of land . Much of the property in Scotland is lined with wooden panelling, mixing the newer styles of fittings, such as a gym, with the older style of using wood as a wall and ceiling surface . The Scottish cottage is a newer build that attempts to capture a flair of old-style design, and has heavy emphasis on recreation and entertainment rooms . The bedroom is a much more pre-fab modern design than other bedrooms in properties worth £1 million or more. The price of some properties increases because of size, whereas other property prices increase because of location . The property also has a cinema room for those who decide that going to the cinema is too expensive after they have paid £1 million for their house . The Scottish property also has a small garage that could easily function as a guest house . The kitchen has a large island to both do cooking and eat at leisure, with large fridges and cupboards . The British real estate market rarely has buyers of £1 million or more, which is why these sorts of properties are so rare, and also tend to sell a lot slower . Alternatively you could multiply your million and buy 12 apartments in Withington, Manchester. The pair of grand Victorian semi-detached . properties are converted into one and two bed apartments and are fully . let - generating £70,000 a year. The flats, if fully occupied, could possibly generate around £70,000 a year, meaning you could earn your investment back in around 10 or 11 years . An alternative to buying a house for yourself is buying property to rent out. By buying this property in Manchester, you could turn the floors into flats and rent it out . The Manchester flats a re a lot more like an investment than a place to live, causing a potential buyer to spend a lot more money doing up the flats than they might by just buying a house for themselves . In Bristol you can become the owners of a nine bedroom manor house in the Somerset hills. Built in 1450 this beautiful manor house in a tiny village is straight out of a romance novel. The huge property has mullioned windows, four foot thick walls, numerous fireplaces, exposed beams and flagstone flooring. The Victorian property based in Somerset, just outside of Bristol, is likely marketed at someone who appreciates the tastes and styles of the Victorian era, as the house is crammed head to toe with memorabilia from Britain's era of empire . The property in Bristol, Somerset, is a lot more of a cosy affair. It features plush ornaments and wooden beams, with the expensive price being based on the age and size of the property rather than the location . The property follows a very Victorian theme, reflecting the time it was built and a buyer will likely be someone who enjoys the sort of taste that the advertising displays . With nine bedrooms and several reception rooms, the property would be perfect for entertaining guests who have similar tastes around a roaring fire on a cold winter's evening . The Somerset property is a lot more rustic, with older features including an aga a giant dining table, and flagstone floors . The property also features a large garden, with the advert displaying a manicured lawn that would probably require a lot of work to maintain . The Somerset house is situated in a cosy village that is only a short distance from Bristol, giving it the pleasures of the country with the convenience of being near the city . The bedrooms are spread across the wide property, which would make it incredibly quiet if there were a smaller amount of people living at the house .

"Tracking collar has located him in California - the state's first wolf in 80 years . By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 13:51 EST, 5 January 2012 . A gray wolf, who wandered hundreds of miles from home in search of a mate, has been captured on camera for the first time. The male wolf, nicknamed Journey, has been tracked via a collar he was fitted with last spring. Wolves usually mate in February - but there were no signs he has found one yet. The collar monitored the creature as he walked away from his pack in Oregon and into California - which has not seen a wolf in 80 years. Lone wolf: A camera set by a hunter captured the grey wolf in Butte Falls, Oregon before he was tracked to California . The black and white photograph was taken in Butte Falls, Oregon on November 14 by an automatic camera set up by a hunter tracking blacktail deer. It shows a wolf sniffing around in dense forest. It is thought to be the animal known officially as OR-7, said Robyn Schneider Brown, an Oregon state biologist. Mr Brown said the wolf in the photo appeared to be wearing a tracking collar and that GPS data showed OR-7 was in the same area of southern Oregon. The two-year-old wolf had been captured . and fitted with a collar by a biologist last spring but was not . photographed at the time. Into the wild: The gray wolf, known officiall as OR-7 but nicknamed Journey, has zig-zagged across the country to find a mate . Since OR-7 left his pack, he has walked . more than 700 miles across mountains, deserts and major highways to . southwestern Oregon and into northern California. Tracking data this week . showed the wolf appeared to be heading south, . said Mark Stopher of the California Department of Fish and Game. Mr Stopher said: 'From Google Earth, it . looks like it is habitat he can find both cover and food in. A lot of . people would like to see OR-7 become an Oregon wolf again. To me, it's a . coin toss now what he is going to do.' Tracked: Grey wolves are fitted with radio collars to monitor their movements by the State wildlife department . OR-7 left the Imnaha pack in northeastern Oregon last September, shortly before the state put a death warrant on his father and a sibling for killing cattle. He is a descendant of wolves . introduced into the Northern Rockies in the 1990s who now have a . regional population of around 1,650. A . conservation group dubbed him Journey, a name picked from a list of . entries sent by children as far away as Finland. Oregon Wild said it was . part of an effort to make the wolf too famous to kill. Steve Pedery, conservation director of Oregon Wild, said: 'Journey is the most famous wolf in the world. It is not surprising that the paparazzi finally caught up with him.' Not following the pack: The gray wolf has struck out alone in a journey that has seen him walk more than 700 miles from its home in Oregon .",Tracking collar has located him in California - the state's first wolf in 80 years .

Strictly Come Dancing could fall victim to a BBC mass cull as BBC bosses consider ending popular programmes such as Top Gear and The Apprentice.

But what the replacements will be remains uncertain as he admitted the Corporation's bosses had failed to come up with a Saturday night ratings winner for years. Scroll down for video . Strictly will, over the next five to ten years, reach the end of its natural life, and new formats need to be created . He said: 'I think there’s a series of very popular formats which over the next five to ten years will reach the end of their natural lives, such as Strictly Come Dancing, The Apprentice, Dragons’ Den, Top Gear, The One Show,' the Express reported. Williams claimed BBC Chief Danny Cohen believes that those who come up with a successful format should be awarded with a higher salary. He made the comments after last year's BBC1 dance contest suffered its lowest ratings for a final for four years. Although more than 11.5million people watched Abbey Clancy as she was crowned the champion of 2013's Strictly, figures were some way behind the performance for the finale for recent years, and proved to be the lowest since 2009.

Anthony Delaney had drunk at least 10 pints of lager at the time of the incident in Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester, but tried to claim he was putting the animal out of its misery after it had been hit by a car. The 30-year-old was filmed booting the . defenceless cat twice during a night out in September last year. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Sickening: Anthony Delaney found the injured cat lying on a street in Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester . Swing: The soldier lines up to kick the cat which had been hit by a car . Savage: The defenceless animal went flying across the floor after Delaney booted it . The horrifying pictures show him setting on the animal as if he was kicking a football. He sent the animal flying through the air and then attacked it again as it lay against a wall. His solicitor was forced to admit that the 30-year-old handled the situation 'appallingly badly'. The cat died just minutes after RSPCA inspectors arrived at the scene at around 5am on Sunday, September 22, last year. The court was told driver Charlotte Lewis-Dobson first spotted the injured animal and phoned the RSPCA before moving her car in front of the cat to protect it from other vehicles. Shockiing: Witnesses watch in horror as the cat was left for dead on the pavement after the horrifying incident . Jailed: Delaney was given an 18-month prison sentence and was banned from keeping animals for five years . She and passenger Nicole Calvert were later confronted by Delaney and his group of friends, who told them ‘you better drive away now’ after pleading with them to leave the animal alone. A statement from Ms Lewis-Dobson said: 'I can’t believe somebody could do that particularly when the cat was injured and distressed. 'It was crying out and wanted to be left alone. Its last few minutes were full of fear and pain.' Delaney was handed an 18-week jail term and banned from keeping animals for five years.

The boom of new private sector jobs and businesses in northern regions is . beginning to outpace London and the south east, a Cabinet minister . claims today. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said that under the . last government prosperity had become dangerously concentrated in . financial services in and around the capital, but the latest statistics . suggested a ‘new economy is emerging’. But he said that in Merseyside . and Lancashire, for instance, there were 48,685 new enterprises created . last year, an 11 per cent increase on the previous year and three times . the rate in London. Rather than relying on the public sector, Mr . Pickles said there was clear evidence of a ‘diverse and balanced economy . based on the innovation and entrepreneurship that lies at the heart of . what makes Britain great’. His remarks came as official figures . boosted hopes of a secure, sustained recovery, showing the economy is . becoming less reliant on consumer spending after a long-awaited surge in . business investment. The Office for National Statistics said . business investment rose by 2.4 per cent quarter on quarter in the final . three months of 2013, against expectations of 1.3 per cent. Upward . revisions to previous estimates mean it has also increased for four . quarters in a row for the first time since 2007 and has increased 8.5 . per cent compared with the previous year. Gross domestic product rose . by 0.7 per cent in the fourth quarter, the Office for National . Statistics confirmed, unrevised from an earlier estimate and in line . with forecasts - meaning the fastest rate of full year growth since the . financial crisis. Prime Minister David Cameron welcomed the figures, . saying in they provided ‘more encouraging news our long-term economic . plan is working’. Samuel Tombs, UK economist at Capital Economics, . said: ‘The second estimate of fourth-quarter GDP provides further . reassurance that the economic recovery is becoming better balanced and . is therefore sustainable.’ Deutsche Bank economist George Buckley . said: ‘This provides some hope that the recovery is gaining breadth even . if, as we expect, overall growth slows during the course of this year.’ The boom of new private sector jobs and businesses in northern regions is beginning to outpace London and the south east, a Cabinet minister claims today . Mr Pickles said that the Government’s economic plan had ‘profound goals’. ‘One . of the many tragedies of the Labour years is that the self-proclaimed . party of the many acted in the interests of just a few. Prosperity, . financial security, opportunities - these were things restricted to too . few parts of country,’ the minister said. ‘If you were from the south . east and worked in financial services, then you were OK. But if you . weren’t, then you were left behind. Changing this will take time but we . are making progress.’ New figures show that in Nottingham, Derby, . Leicester and the surrounding towns, more than 49,010 new . apprenticeships were started last year, more than in the whole of . London. ‘Young people in our former industrial heartlands getting the . chance to develop practical skills, kick start a career and of course . the chance to take home a decent pay-packet,’ Mr Pickles said. In . Birmingham, Yorkshire and Humberside the rise of private sector . employment has been higher in every year since 2010 than in the boom . years between 2000 and 2007. In Coventry, the number of young people . starting an apprenticeship has doubled, while in Liverpool, there has . been a five per cent jump in the number of private sector jobs. In . places including Stoke-on-Trent, Tyneside and Plymouth, there is now . seeing economic growth which is far outstripping the national average. Mr . Pickles claimed a new generation of enterprise zones, with significant . business tax breaks, simplified planning permission and superfast . broadband, was helping to encourage growth of the private sector in the . regions. New figures show that in Nottingham, Derby, Leicester and the surrounding towns, more than 49,010 new apprenticeships were started last year, more than in the whole of London (pictured) ‘Those conditions are attracting massive investment like . the £800 million being put into Manchester’s Airport City by a . British-Chinese joint venture, creating 16,000 jobs, or the £500 million . being invested in the Black Country by Jaguar Land Rover: one of the . great British brands spearheading the recovery,’ he said. ‘But . there is still a long way to go. The job isn’t even half done, and . nothing would be more dangerous than a return to the same old recipe of . more spending, more borrowing and more taxes that Labour offers.’ The minister added that Britain could ‘look forward to the future with confidence’. ‘In . April we’ll have the lowest rate of corporation tax in the G7, and . thousands of employers will no longer have to pay employers’ National . Insurance contributions, meaning they take more people on and provide . more families with financial security. ‘The tax threshold will . rise to £10,000 so no one will pay tax for the £10,000 they earn. In . short, they take home more with every pay cheque. ‘I know from . experience how much these changes will help. From behind the till at my . father’s corner shop in Keighley I witnessed neighbours on a council . estate working very hard for a wage and being able to keep their family . secure because of that. It wasn’t easy at times but it had a big impact . on me. ‘I’ve always believed that Government must create the . right conditions to help anyone who wants to work hard and get on in . life, to do so. It not only encourages economic growth but gives people . the opportunity to support their own families.’ A Treasury spokesman added a note of caution: ‘As the Chancellor said last week the recovery is not yet secure. ‘The . Budget next month will do more to support investment and exports, and . the biggest risk to the recovery would be abandoning the plan that’s . providing economic security for hardworking people.’","Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said a ‘new economy is emerging’

Royal Bank of Scotland was warned by the government today that it should not go ahead with paying £576million in staff bonuses while it is still recieving 'life support' from the taxpayer. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said that while the bank's survival depends on the generosity of the British public, it had to be 'restrained, sensible and responsible' in setting pay deals. The troubled bank reignited the row over pay when it revealed plans for huge bonuses, including £237million for its investment bankers, despite slumping into the red with an £8.2billion loss. Controversial: RBS revealed a staff bonus pot of £576m for 2013 (pictured is its London headquarters) The bonus pot is slightly smaller than the £679million haul for 2012, although this in part was a result of job losses from its investment . banking team. Mr Clegg said RBS 'is not a normal bank' because it is 'not able to stand on its own two feet'. He told ITV's Daybreak: 'A loss-making bank that is basically on the kind of life support system because of the generosity of British taxpayers shouldn’t be dishing out ever larger amounts of money in pay and bonuses and, you know, it needs to continue to come down. 'They are entitled to pay their staff what they want when they are standing on their own two feet, at the moment they are not. 'As long as you’re there because the British public have been generous to keep you in existence, be restrained, be sensible, be responsible in the kind of remuneration. 'I think in RBS’ case it’s different, . of course there will be bonuses but it is really important those bonuses . are as restrained and limited as possible.' The taxpayer-backed lender agreed the . bonus windfall with UK Financial Investments, the body charged with . managing government stakes in banks, according to Sky News. Deputy PM Nick Clegg . The losses of the taxpayer-backed lender, which is just over 80 per cent owned by the Government, have widened significantly from £5.3billion in 2012. It includes  £3.8billion set aside for a string of scandal-related charges and a £4.8billion hit for the creation of an internal ‘bad bank’. Chris Leslie, Labour’s shadow Treasury minister, said:  'Taxpayers will be incredulous that such large bonuses continue to be paid out at a time when huge losses are being made.

Mr McEwan, who took over from Stephen Hester at the start of October 2013, said recently that the bank and its directors were paying the price for past errors. ‘I know this team is not responsible for past mistakes but we are running the company and have to show we take accountability seriously,’ he said. ‘Fronting up to our past mistakes is very expensive, but RBS is now a stronger bank.’ He did not name Mr Goodwin, who in 2012 was stripped of the knighthood given to him by Gordon Brown. But he blamed the aggressive expansionism of the bank, one of its key characteristics under Mr Goodwin’s leadership. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said RBS was 'in a different category' from other banks because it is largely taxpayer-owned and should show restraint on pay and bonuses. Mr Clegg told ITV1's Daybreak: 'A loss-making bank that is basically on a life-support system because of the generosity of British taxpayers shouldn't be dishing out ever larger amounts of money in pay and bonuses. 'The overall amount has been coming down. It needs to continue to come down. They are entitled to pay their staff what they want when they are standing on their own two feet. At the moment they are not.'","The Royal Bank of Scotland made losses of £5.3billion in 2012 .

Lingerie boss: Michelle Mone's company have been ordered to pay £15,000 compensation to a former director . A former director of Michelle Mone’s lingerie company who left after discovering a plant pot in his office had been bugged has won his case for unfair dismissal. Scott Kilday walked out of MJM International when he found a listening device hidden within artificial flowers. The bug had been set up amid fears that Mr Kilday was planning to leave and work with Mone’s ex-husband Michael. Mr Kilday, 35, who had the £55,000 role of operations director at MJM, took the firm to an employment tribunal after discovering the lingerie tycoon had listened to recordings. Following the hearing in Glasgow last September, judges yesterday found in his favour, stating in a written judgement that MJM’s decision to plant the listening device was likely to ‘destroy or seriously damage’ Mr Kilday’s trust in his bosses. He was awarded £15,920.26 in compensation, but a breach of contract claim that he had been entitled to shares worth £25,000 was dismissed by the tribunal. Last night, Mr Kilday described the process as ‘extremely stressful’, adding: ‘I’m delighted with the result and glad that I can now put it all behind me. At the end of the day, it’s not about the money, but standing up for what’s morally correct and not being bullied into keeping quiet. ‘With the time I dedicated to MJM International, it was unfortunate that it came to this, but I can now walk away with my head held high and, more importantly, my integrity fully intact.’ The tribunal had been told how the situation at MJM became ‘difficult’ after Mone split with her husband and business partner Michael in December 2011. Mr Mone eventually left after MAS Holdings bought into the business in February last year. Mr Kilday said that around that time Mone asked him to resign as a director and he ‘sought legal advice’. He also told how Mone had been ‘a very difficult person to work with’ and that his relationship with her had latterly been ‘tense’. He then set up talks with Eliaz Poleg, chairman of the firm following the sale. But days before the meeting, Mr Kilday found the bug. ‘I had a look in the pot and saw a cable coming out, which was wrapped around artificial flowers,’ he said. Scroll down for video .

It emerged during the hearing that Mr Kilday now works for Mr Mone’s firm Pendulum Apparel. Last night, a spokesman for Ultimo Brands International said: ‘We are delighted to have won the main aspect of this case relating to the shares of £25,000.

The Co-op has hoisted the ‘for sale’ sign on its farms and chain of pharmacies as it heads towards the biggest loss in its history. The troubled mutual wants to sell 15 farms, which are used to grow some of the vegetables found in its supermarkets. It confirmed it is also in the early stages of negotiations to offload its chain of 750 pharmacies, raising fears over the futures of around 6,500 staff. The Cop-operative Group headquarters in Manchester. The troubled mutual wants to sell 15 farms, used to grow vegetables for its stores, and the chain is in talks to offload its 750 pharmacies . Both businesses were yesterday described as ‘crown jewels’ of the Co-op’s sprawling empire, which spans from funeral homes to supermarkets. The Co-op set up its first farm in Shropshire in 1896 and has had a pharmacy business since 1945. But the group has been forced to take the drastic action because of the parlous finances of its bank, which was rescued from collapse in December. This involved ceding control of the bank to institutional investors, including US hedge funds, to plug a huge black hole in its finances. The Co-op Group is expected on March 26 to announce it made a loss of more than £2billion last year, mainly driven by losses at the bank. There are fears that thousands of staff across the group could lose their jobs as the Co-op prepares to slash its costs by £500 million over the next four years. Yesterday, one of the 200 staff at Co-op Farms accused the Co-op of selling off its ‘crown jewels’ to prop up its ‘floundering businesses’. The worker, who asked not to be named, said: ‘Co-op is in a mess. I guess there will be a huge amount of redundancies across the business and I don’t expect to be in a job in six months.’ He added: ‘It is selling of the jewels in the crown to prop up the bank and the supermarket chain, both of which are floundering.’ The Co-Op Group is expected to announce next month that it made a loss of more than £2billion last year . The Co-op Bank, which has almost five million customers, had to be rescued in December after a £1.5 billion black hole was discovered in its finances. It is also fighting to salvage its reputation after the bank’s former chairman the Reverend Paul Flowers was exposed in November allegedly buying hard drugs. In total, seven investigations have been launched into the bank, including one by the City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority and another by former City minister Lord Myners. The group will reveal its plans to overhaul the business when it announces its results next month. This could include scrapping its near £1 million annual donation to the Labour Party. The Co-op’s farms are spread throughout England and Scotland, including Oadby Lodge Farm in Leicester and Delab Farm in Aberdeenshire. They are mainly arable, producing wheat and barley to make cereal, as well as vegetables. Just two per cent of the produce - including apples and potatoes - is supplied to the Co-op’s chain of supermarkets. But the farms have played a central role in the Co-op’s ‘ethical’ movement for more than 100 years. The first farm was bought in Roden, Shropshire, to grow potatoes and other crops for local co-operative society food stores. A Co-op spokesman said it was selling the farms as ‘part of the wider strategic review of all of its businesses’. He added: ‘In addition, it is exploring options for the future of the pharmacy business; this could include the sale in whole or part of the business.’","Troubled mutual to sell 15 farms used to grow vegetables for stores .

'Was a nightmare from very beginning as they double booked our room and continually lied to us about the booking. 'Our friends came all the way from England and were very disappointed as their booking was wrong also......will stay clear of this hotel and advise everyone else to!!!!' In his rebuke, which has since been removed from the website, Mr Scrivenor said he had given the couple a free bottle of wine, £15 off their Valentine’s night stay plus a free overnight stay in March as an apology for double-booking their room. Response: Mr Scrivenor hit back, accusing the guests of getting drunk, threatening other guests, damaging a wall, and failing to pay their £400 bill .

The Crags Hotel currently has an overall TripAdvisor rating of four out of five. Classic: A scene from comedy series Fawlty Towers in which Basil, played by John Cleese, bashes a car with a branch . Earlier this month the owners of another Scottish B&B accused TripAdvisor of operating ‘above the law’ after the couple lost a bitter legal wrangle over bad reviews posted on the global travel guide. Martin and Jacqui Clark went to court in an attempt to force the £3billion organisation to disclose details of the writers of two negative online posts so they can sue the authors. The Clarks, who run the nine-bedroom Tigh na Cheo guest house at Kinlochleven, Inverness-shire, maintain that both reports posted within a month of each other were fabricated and malicious. They wanted to raise an action for defamation against whoever posted the comments, claiming the poor reviews damaged their reputation and cost them business. But their legal bid stumbled at the first hurdle when a judge at the Court of Session in Edinburgh rejected a request for a disclosure order to force TripAdvisor to reveal the names, addresses and other information on the authors’ identity. In a judgment that could have far-reaching implications for other victims of bad reviews, Judge Paul Arthurson, QC, ruled Scots courts have no jurisdiction in the matter.","Alex Scrivenor hit back when guests described their stay at his B&B .

Cambridge academic Kate Stone was in a coma for a week following the harrowing attack, which took place as she was walking with friends on a New Year's holiday. Two months later, the 44-year-old has still not been able to return to work, and can only eat and drink using a tube. 'Lucky to be alive': Scientist Kate Stone has talked about the ordeal of being gored in the neck by a stag . The . attack took place outside Dr Stone's holiday home in Lochailort in the . early hours of December 30 while she was returning from a night out in . the dark. The deer was panicking after being trapped in the garden, and when it crashed into Dr Stone it gored her throat. She was airlifted from the scene to hospital in Glasgow, put in an induced coma for a week and underwent two operations on her throat. Two months later, Dr Stone - who runs a technology company in Cambridge after leaving her university job - is still recovering at her sister's home in Dundee. She said she was 'still only realising the magnitude of what's happened' as she recalled walking through the garden gate then 'a massive thud... and then a second thud'. Holiday: Dr Stone was attacked by the deer in the early hours of the morning while on holiday with friends . Trapped: The deer was stuck in the garden of Dr Stone's holiday home in the Scottish Highlands . She added: 'I shouted for my friends to come over. At first they thought I was joking, but they could tell by the way I was gurgling, rather than speaking, and my neck was all cut open - it became clear I couldn't breathe or speak properly.' In the immediate aftermath of the attack, Dr Stone felt no pain because she had gone into shock, and concentrated on staying alive while she waited for help to arrive. 'A friend told me to focus on breathing so I remained very calm and I just did one breath in, one breath out,' she said. 'And that's what I did for about 40 minutes.' Doctors told her that the stag's antler went through her trachea and oesophagus, damaging her vocal cords and fracturing her neck, before hitting her spine. 'I'm told it stopped just a few millimetres from my spinal cord,' she said. 'I'm also told that if it had been slightly to the left of the right I would have bled to death at the scene.

After leaving hospital, Dr Stone was unable to write, walk or talk properly, and still needs a tube to eat and drink. 'I'm totally lucky to be alive,' she said. 'I feel like I've gained nearly everything back, kind of from the brink of death. 'It could be a life-changing experience but it confirms how I already feel about so many things. I tell people I meet, ""Life is short and at any moment something can happen us."" 'I always thought it would be a car accident - I think a stag accident is much more my style.'

Violent: Steven Davis, 34, was jailed for 15 years for slashing his best friend with a kitchen knife . A heavy drinker has been jailed for 15 years for slashing his best friend’s throat after asking him to stand up and show him how tall he was. Steven Davis, 34, had spent a night drinking with Patrick Bentley at a flat in Preston, Lancashire, when he slashed his neck from behind with a kitchen knife. Despite stabbing his friend twice more in the torso as he tried to flee, a court ruled Davis - who had 114 previous convictions, four for violence - was not dangerous enough to receive a life sentence. Jeremy Grout-Smith, prosecuting, told Preston Crown Court the attack began when Davis asked his friend to stand up to see how tall he was. Without warning, he came up behind him and deliberately slashed his throat. When the victim tried to get out of the flat by the front door, he was stabbed twice by the defendant in the abdomen. A doctor who treated Mr Bentley said the neck wound only just missed slicing into a number of major blood vessels. Mr Bentley had been left 'very anxious and nervous around people, even close friends'. The court heard Davis, from Preston, had a life made 'chaotic' by alcohol abuse and had appeared in court 72 times, mostly for drunken behaviour. He denied trying to kill his friend - claiming he could not explain why he launched the attack - but was found guilty of attempted murder. Four of his previous convictions involved violence against a person but none of them had serious consequences, the court heard. Sharon Watson, defending, said: 'He is very sorry he has hurt his friend. Wound: The scar left on 43-year-old victim Patrick Bentley, who was stabbed twice more as he fled . Trauma: The court heard he had been left 'very anxious and nervous around people, even close friends' 'Alcohol was involved and it is plain to see that at 34 it is the chronic long-term abuse of alcohol which has wrecked his life so far. 'He simply doesn’t know that motivated him to do what he did and that extreme act of violence was completely out of character.' Recorder Anthony Russell QC told Davis: 'This was a spontaneous attempt to kill, without any provocation. 'Fortunately, others came to Mr Bentley’s aid and as a result of their actions and that of paramedics he was able to survive. 'He was fortunate because if [the throat wound] had been any deeper it would have led to catastrophic bleeding and almost certainly death. Cut: Images released by Lancashire Police showed the cut to the victim's throat was several inches long . Sentence: Preston Crown Court jailed Davis for 15 years but ruled he was not dangerous enough to receive a life sentence. He had 114 previous convictions, though only four were for violence against a person . 'I have considered whether I should impose a life sentence, but I have come to the conclusion that you don’t fit the criteria of dangerousness as defined by Parliament.' DC Mike Riley, of Lancashire Police, said: 'I am pleased with the sentence passed which reflects the seriousness of this unprovoked attack. 'The victim is very lucky to have survived. Fortunately such cases are rare but I hope it sends a message that such cases are treated exceptionally seriously by the police and the courts.'","WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT: Steven Davis, 34, had 114 convictions .

Married couples and civil partners could make a binding agreement about how their property or finances should be shared if their relationship breaks down . A so-called 'prenup' law that allows a couple to set the terms of a divorce before they get married has been put forward by the Government's law reform advisers. Under the current law, couples can make pre- and post-nuptial agreements but they are not binding and the parties cannot be certain they will be upheld. A report from the Law Commission, Matrimonial Property Needs and Agreements, includes a draft Bill which, if implemented, would bring legally-recognised 'qualifying nuptial agreements' into effect. They would enable married couples and civil partners to make a binding agreement about how their property or finances should be shared if their relationship breaks down, the Commission said. Professor Elizabeth Cooke, Law Commissioner for property, family and trust law, said: 'Pre- and post-nuptial agreements are becoming more commonplace but the courts will not always follow them and lawyers are therefore not able to give clear advice about their effect. 'Qualifying nuptial agreements would give couples autonomy and control, and make the financial outcome of separation more predictable. We have built in safeguards to ensure that they cannot be used to impose hardship on either party, nor to escape responsibility for children or to burden the state.' As part of a package of measures, the Commission has also recommended that the Family Justice Council, the non-statutory advisory body made up of representatives from the family justice system, produces guidance on financial needs. Guidance would explain the outcome a judge would aim for in determining a settlement, including achieving eventual financial independence. Ms Cooke added: 'We believe that married couples and civil partners should have the power to decide their own financial arrangements, but should not be able to contract out of their responsibilities for each other's financial needs, or for their children. Guidance would explain the outcome a judge would aim for in determining a settlement, including achieving eventual financial independence. 'The measures we are recommending would help couples understand and meet their financial responsibilities and, where appropriate, achieve financial independence.' Slater & Gordon family lawyer Amanda McAlister said: 'The Law Commission recommendations are to be welcomed for their potential to reduce conflict and costs for those who are seeking to end their marriage or civil partnership. 'But it is vital that any changes in this area must recognise that family law, and particularly divorce and separation settlements, are inherently complex - a couple with no children who is seeking to end their marriage or civil partnership after five years will have very different needs to those who have been married for 15 years with three children. 'So long as we avoid a one-size-fits-all approach to this area of the law and continue to recognise that every couple, and indeed family, is different, then I think these recommendations could potentially lead to a smoother and more cost effective separation process for many couples.' Marilyn Stowe, senior partner at Stowe Family Law, said: 'These measures are perfect. They are tempered. While the Law Commission does not recommend radical change, it has recognised what family lawyers already know. 'Because of the economic situation and the Government's demolition of family law legal aid, fewer people are able to access professional legal advice. As a result, confusion abounds and it is now necessary to provide additional information and 'simplify' the current system.' She added: 'Although the Law Commission is recommending that prenuptial agreements should become binding in law, it also proposes rigid criteria. 'For example, a prenup would only be binding once both partners' financial needs and financial responsibilities towards their children had been met. This means that an unscrupulous spouse would be unable to 'contract out' of providing for their children.'","Under current law, couples can make pre- and post-nuptial agreements but they are not binding and the parties cannot be certain they will be upheld .

"By . James Chapman . and Jason Groves . PUBLISHED: . 19:58 EST, 26 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 04:32 EST, 27 February 2014 . Plans to tear up the official definition of child poverty will be put on ice today following a Government row. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith proposed that factors such as family breakdown and debt should be included in a new measure of children’s life chances. But senior colleagues are understood to have warned that the move would leave the Government open to charges of deliberately changing the goalposts in an attempt to mask the alleged impact of its austerity policies. Clash: Lib Dem sources said plans by Iain Duncan Smith (left) to change the definition of child poverty were blocked by George Osborne (right) amid fears it would lay the Government open to claims of 'goalpost-shifting' Lib Dem sources insisted they had been prepared to back the plan – but claimed it had been blocked by Chancellor George Osborne. One well-placed source said the reform was now ‘on hold’ and there is now unlikely to be any significant changes to measuring child poverty before the next election in 2015. The current measure – 60 per cent of median earnings – was made law under Labour. The minimum wage will rise to £6.50 an hour – below the hike to £7 suggested by the Chancellor – it emerged yesterday. The Low Pay Commission instead recommended a 3 per cent increase, up 19p on the current rate of £6.31, from October. The independent advisory group held out the prospect of further above-inflation increases this year, but there appears little chance of the rate reaching £7 by 2015/16, as George Osborne hinted last month. Sources said it was unlikely the Government would overrule the commission to impose a bigger than recommended rise. A Conservative spokesman said the rise ‘would be welcome news – a real-terms increase for millions of people for the first time in over five years plus the prospect of more above-inflation increases to come’. In January, the Chancellor said he backed a dramatic increase in the £6.31 rate, delighting Tory MPs but alarming business leaders, who insisted it should not be raised by more than inflation. Mr Osborne said low-paid workers should now ‘enjoy the fruits’ of the economic recovery. But Labour accused him of ‘misleading and empty rhetoric’. In a further rebuke to the Chancellor, a source close to Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable said it was ‘unhelpful for politicians to speculate about what the minimum wage should be’, insisting it should be left to the independent expert body. David Cameron, Mr Osborne and Mr Duncan Smith have now agreed that reform would be ‘complex’ and further work would be needed to ensure any new system was ‘robust’. The Government is thought to be preparing various measures to help the poorest in society in a riposte to Church leaders, who last week criticised its welfare reforms. They are likely to include moves to reduce energy and water bills, an expansion of free school transport and boosting of credit unions. Despite a  £170billion increase in welfare spending, Labour failed to meet its aim of halving child poverty by 2010/11. In 2012, Mr Duncan Smith argued Labour’s definition of child poverty – based purely on family income – was perverse when other factors can be just as critical in determining children’s life chances. He suggested broader ways of calculating child poverty – including whether their parents are in work, educational failure, family breakdown, problem debt and poor health. The Work and Pensions Secretary says the Government’s new universal credit, which will replace all out-of-work benefits from next year, will ensure the vast majority of children will be lifted out of poverty if at least one parent works 35 hours a week at the minimum wage, or 24 hours if they are  a lone parent. Rachel Reeves, Labour’s work and pensions spokesman, said: ‘Any attempt to change the way poverty is measured won’t do anything to help the children whose lives are being damaged by the rise in poverty we are seeing under this Government.’ A Whitehall source said Mr Duncan Smith remained committed to finding a more comprehensive definition of poverty but acknowledged there was no agreement on exactly what it should include: ‘There is a lot of work going on about this and that will continue, but it has become clear that there is no simple answer.’ Instead, Mr Duncan Smith will today publish a detailed consultation on a new child poverty strategy, spelling out action on unemployment, family breakdown and drug addiction, as well as reaffirming the Government’s commitment to ending child poverty by 2020. Labour work and pensions spokesman Rachel Reeves said: 'Any attempt to change the way poverty is measured won't do anything to help the children whose lives are being damaged... under this Government'","Iain Duncan Smith planned to include factors like family breakdown or debt .

A British man has died in the French Alps after falling close to 2,000 ft while skiing off piste near Chamonix. David Tapsfield, 28, was ski touring when a snow cornice, an overhanging edge of snow on a ridge, collapsed from under him. His fall triggered a huge avalanche which swept him down the mountain. The experienced mountaineer, who had moved to France from Whitley Bay a few years ago, was described by friends as 'highly popular and very down-to-earth'. Accident: David Tapsfield, 28, was ski touring near Chamonix, when a snow cornice, an overhanging edge of snow on a ridge, collapsed from under him . Mr Tapsfield was with a Scottish friend, Lorne Cameron, from Glasgow, who survived uninjured. The tragedy happened at about 1pm on Tuesday on Mont Buet, the highest mountain peak in the Chamonix area outside of the Mont Blanc Massif. Mr Cameron frantically dug his friend out of the snow and tried to resuscitate him. He alerted the emergency services who airlifted Mr Tapsfield to hospital. But, tragically, he was pronounced dead on arrival. A Chamonix police spokesman said: 'A cornice ruptured and the person fell a very long distance - about 600 metres. 'The fall triggered the slide of a huge mass of snow or an avalanche. 'The man's friend found him under the snow and pulled him out. He gave him first aid and the man was taken by helicopter to hospital but sadly he died.' Mr Tapsfield had moved to Chamonix a few years ago to pursue his love of the mountains and set up a successful sausage-making business selling his wares to local restaurants and pubs. As a teenager David was part of the Football Development Scheme for 16 to 19-year-olds at Tyne Metropolitan College in North Tyneside. In 2005 he won a scholarship at Lafeyatte College in New Jersey, USA, one of the top six colleges in the country, to study and play the game. Location: The accident took place on Mont Buet in the French Alps, near the ski resort of Chamonix . Ian Bogie, ex-Gateshead and Stockport manager, who helped run the scheme at the college, knew David and is devastated by the news of his death. Mr Bogie, of Tynemouth, said: 'I am absolutely shocked. I can't believe this has happened to David. He was a very talented footballer and he was on our scheme.' 'He was genuinely a smashing lad and I'm so shocked.' A snow cornice is formed by wind blowing snow over a sharp terrain break, such as the crest of a mountain or along the sides of gullies, where it attaches and builds out horizontally. It is extremely dangerous to ski or hike on them or underneath them and the vulnerability of the structure poses a high risk of triggering avalanches. They are particularly dangerous during sunny weather and the area has experienced warm weather during the past week. A spokesperson from the Foreign & Commonwealth Office said: 'We are aware of the death of a British national, in Chamonix on 25th February. 'We stand ready to provide consular assistance upon request.' This is the second deadly skiing incident involving a Briton in just two days. A 23-year-old man from South London died on Monday after crashing into a snow cannon after losing control going down black piste in the Austrian Alps. The man, only identified as Alexander O, had refused to wear a crash helmet, his mother told police, and died at the scene after hitting his head on a metal pole on the snow cannon in St. Anton.","David Tapsfield, 28, was ski touring when he was killed in the French Alps .

Writing in the journal Astrobiology, the scientists describe microscopic tunnels found throughout the meteorite's interior. ‘The observed microtunnels display curved, undulating shapes consistent with bioalteration textures observed in basaltic glasses,’ wrote the scientists. They also discovered tiny blobs of carbon-rich minerals that are embedded within layers of rock, which the team claim reveals ancient weathering through biological processes. The researchers say they ‘cannot exclude the possibility that the carbon-rich regions in both sets of features’ are the product of non-biological processes.

An aristocrat attacked a businessman and a security guard at a luxury hotel while drunkenly ranting: ‘You brown people are ruining Britain.’ Baroness Marie-Claire Von Alvensleben’s rampage at the Belgravia Sheraton in London ended with her spending 15 hours in a police cell. The 60-year-old had been arrested for obstructing police who cornered her at a nearby hotel, a court heard yesterday. High spirits: Von Alvensleben with Michael Barrymore at charity event in 2000 . High life: Michael Barrymore grapples with Baroness Marie Claire Von Alvensleben at a restaurant awards ceremony (left). She can be seen at Cowes Week (right) in 2003 . Adam Sumel, a Canadian businessman, . was the first victim of her racist tirade in the bar at the Sheraton. He slapped him across the hands five times and said: ‘N****** should . not be allowed here – you brown people are ruining Britain.’ Baroness Marie-Claire von Alvensleben launched into a racist tirade against 'blacks, Arabs, Asians and Jews' Tom . Gill, prosecuting, told Hammersmith magistrates that the guard, Haliz . Hamza, then stepped in. ‘He spoke to the defendant because other guests . complained about her behaviour and she clenched both her fists and . pounded his chest repeatedly,’ he said. As Mr Hamza escorted Von Alvensleben out of the hotel, she said: ‘You have stayed here ten years, this must be India.’ The baroness carried on with a rant about ‘blacks, Arabs, Asians and Jews’. Police were called and found her at the Diplomat Hotel. ‘She . was intoxicated at the time, she was being obstructive to the officer,’ said Mr Gill. ‘She was using a mobile phone as the officer tried to . speak to her. ‘She took a . long time to get dressed and she was abusive and aggressive to the . officer as he tried to cuff her.’ Von Alvensleben told the officers she . felt her drinks were spiked and did not know she should not have mixed . alcohol with medication for depression. The . society figure, who lives in Geneva and depends on the generosity of . well-connected friends, obtained her title from a German aristocrat she . divorced a decade ago. It dates back to 1163. She . has socialised with chefs Gordon Ramsay and Ian Pengelley and, at a . restaurant awards party in 2000, was seen rolling around on the floor . with entertainer Michael Barrymore. She was also pictured at an event with her arm around Sebastian Sainsbury, the great grandson of the supermarket founder.  At another event she was seen posing with Italian chef Aldo Zilli. The baroness is also a novelist and has written a series of books entitled 'Absolutely Everything About...' but her publishing firm has failed. Jyothi Somavarapu, in mitigation, said she was penniless and was in London to collect debts from the PR company which matches buyers and sellers in the international property and art world.

Alvensleben told District Judge Jane Fudge she had returned to the . hotel two days afterwards to apologise. ‘I don’t remember assaulting . anybody,’ she claimed. ‘The police were very nasty and I retaliated.’ But . Judge Fudge said: ‘What concerns me is the foul, unpleasant and abusive . language used against other patrons of the hotel, there is no excuse . whatsoever. You did use words and you continued to use those words. ‘You’ve . got some extremely unpleasant racial abuse accompanying this and that . concerns me. What was said was extremely unpleasant and no doubt . extremely distressing for those around her that heard this.’ Von Alvensleben pleaded guilty to racially aggravated assault and obstructing a police officer. The baroness was handed six weeks of imprisonment, suspended for 12 months.

Stephen Elkins won the 2009 Worthing International Birdman contest but also claimed the £30,000 bonus for 'flying' 100 metres off the town's pier . A champion birdman was brought down to earth yesterday – losing his court claim for a £30,000 prize. Stephen Elkins won the 2009 Worthing International Birdman contest but also claimed the £30,000 bonus for ‘flying’ 100 metres off the town’s pier. However, officials said the 51-year-old managed only 99.86m in his modified glider before hitting the sea. It led to a long dispute that ended in Brighton County Court when His Honour Jonathan Simpkiss ruled that he was ‘not satisfied’ the competitor had crossed the mark. Judges conceded that the triangulation technique used to measure flights could be as much as five metres out. Mr Elkins, from Hope, Derbyshire, claimed that the margin of error meant he should have been awarded the prize. ‘What I object to is having to fly well past the 100-metre mark to be awarded a prize for flying 100 metres,’ he said. He added: 'I feel that I went the distance. When I came up in the water I was right next to the buoy.' Birdman judge Jim Brooks said the distance awarded to Mr Elkins - a hang-glider designer - was the furthest of the organisers’ calculations. He defended the triangulation technique used but conceded it was only accurate to between one and five metres. That means the actual result of Mr Elkins’ flight - in front of thousands of spectators on August 22, 2009 - will never be known. Mr Brooks said: 'It was a brilliant flight. If he had just gone a couple of metres past then it would have been a clear win. 'We judged that the buoys were being dragged back towards the pier at the time and that he fell short of the 100m mark. 'Everyone wants to see it won. It would be such a fantastic achievement and great publicity for the event.' Mr Elkins said the inaccuracy of the judges’ measurement technique meant his flight was within their tolerance and should have been deemed a winner. He said: 'If they can be up to five metres out then I have clearly flown the distance. 'I was very lucky to get things coming together on the day and the chances of that happening again are slim.' The judges used triangulation and trigonometry, developed by Greek mathematician Pythagoras, to measure the distance flown by the birdmen . Judge Simpkiss said: 'It is clearly a difficult matter to measure the distance flown by the competitors in this competition and this must be judged against the context, which is of a fun competition with some serious competitors. 'It has not yet reached the sophistication of horseracing or international athletics and no evidence has been advanced to suggest otherwise. 'Unlike the long-jump or discus, a mark is not left in the sand pit or ground which can then be measured. 'I conclude that the claimant has not satisfied me that, in accordance with the rules, he flew the required distance and has not made out his case for the Jackpot Prize. 'The judges made a decision not to award the prize. The claim is therefore dismissed.' He added: 'Even if I am wrong and there is now evidence to justify the prize being awarded the evidence did not exist until long after the end of the competition. 'It was far too late for there to have been a successful challenge by that stage.' The judgement came as a relief to organisers Worthing Town Centre Initiative, which has insurance to cover the cost of a Jackpot Prize win. Had they lost, they would have faced a huge hike in premiums, which could have threatened the running of the event. Chairman Chris Spratt said: 'The Birdman event is free to spectators and provides fantastic family fun while raising the profile of the town and raising thousands of pounds for charities. Judge Simpkiss said: 'It is clearly a difficult matter to measure the distance flown by the competitors in this competition and this must be judged against the context, which is of a fun competition with some serious competitors' 'The WTCI see themselves as guardians of business and public funds that are used for the good of Worthing and the last thing we wanted was a legal case wasting money because of a spurious claim. 'We had no option but to defend our position vigorously and we are pleased that a judge has found our actions to be credible. 'We can now get on with our objectives and championing Worthing Town Centre.' Mr Elkins said he was 'pretty devastated' by the verdict having vociferously put his claim across for nearly five years. He added: 'I am very frustrated. I do not think they understand the ramifications. 'The ruling is very peculiar and hard to understand but perhaps I am too close to the case.' Mr Elkins said costs for the case had not been awarded yet but hoped he would not have to pay both sides’ legal expenses. He added: 'I am not optimistic.' The judges used triangulation and trigonometry, developed by Greek mathematician Pythagoras, to measure the distance flown by the birdmen. Three observers measured the angle between their points and the landing spot of each contestant.One of them is on the pier below the flyers, one on the promenade at the base of the pier, and one on the promenade at the 100m mark. Knowing the distance between each of the three measuring points, they then calculate the distance flown using mathematical equations governing the angles within triangles. But the system is not perfect and with the buoys used as distance markers tethered to the seabed and therefore at the whim of the tide, it can never be 100 per cent accurate.","Stephen Elkins won the 2009 Worthing International Birdman contest .

A man who comfort ate his way to a 50st bulk following his wife's murder has lost an amazing 30st thanks to a lifesaving gastric bypass. Chuck Turner, 45, from Beaumont in Texas, had become so large, a 25lb lymphedema, a lump caused by a build-up of fluid, had appeared on his leg, putting him in danger of losing it. His vast frame also put his marriage to his second wife, Nissa, under immense strain and left him unable to play with his adopted son, Nathan. Scroll down for video . Chuck's weight began to balloon after he turned to food for comfort following the murder of his first wife . Chuck managed to shed over 400lb following his gastric bypass surgery, but the journey of his weight loss was not easy . Now, a year after having surgery, Chuck lost more than half of his body weight and, for the first time in several years, has been able to return to work. His re-entry to the jobs market is particularly significant, because at 50st, Chuck had been confined to the sofa, and suffered from a long list of medical problems. Speaking on TLC show, My 600lb Life, which was filmed before his dramatic weight loss kicked in, Chuck said: 'My weight makes things a lot harder on me, it makes it hard to breathe, it’s hard for me to stand and get around. It’s hard for me to do normal things; my weight has handicapped me. 'I hurt a lot, I have a lymphedema on my leg and right now on a scale of one to 10, the pain is a nine. At 50st and with a huge growth on his leg, Chuck's movement was restricted and his relationship with his wife and son was suffering . 'I’m tired and exhausted and I just can’t keep doing this. I’d rather be a dead man than have to live like this the rest of my life.’ Chuck's weight problems began after he began comfort eating following the tragic murder of his first wife. 'When I was a kid growing up I didn’t see myself getting really big like I am now,' he explains. 'I was a normal sized kid. I’d say it was my thirties when I started putting the weight on gradually. ‘My weight got up to 250lbs, then 280lbs and it reached about 300lbs and then my wife was murdered. It just floored me.' Wiping away tears, he added: She was a good person, my best friend. I just couldn’t take it so I turned to food. 'I shut the world out and just locked myself away and ate fast food three times a day. I wasn’t even thinking about food – I’d just blank my mind out.' Chuck's weight was so out of control he was willing to risk surgery in a bid to regain his life . ‘For a long time I lost all concept of my weight, and then I went to a scrap metal place to weigh myself. I was 698lb (50st) and I couldn’t believe it.’ Despite dealing with his wife’s murder and his escalating weight, Chuck managed to find love with his second wife, Nissa. Having struggled with her own weight, Nissa, who met Chuck when he weighed about 600lb, refused to let his excess pounds thwart their relationship. ‘He was very shy and he didn’t want to get out of the truck and introduce himself properly because of his size,' she reveals. Chuck's inability to help his wife Nissa placed a huge strain on their relationship, as she fulfilled the role of carer, rather than spouse . 'I felt like I should give him a chance because I felt all my relationships had failed because of my weight and I didn’t want to judge him for his weight.' The pair married not long after meeting and adopted a son, who they named Nathan, but Chuck’s weight impinged on his relationship with his new family. ‘He’s the best thing in the world,' says Chuck of his son. 'I’d like to go outside and play with Nathan, but I can hardly walk without getting winded. ‘The main thing that really upsets me is putting a lot of strain on my wife. I can’t do my part of all the things I’m supposed to do. And I want to provide for Nissa, to give her the life she deserves. ‘I think losing weight would make a world of difference; it would make me a better dad and a better husband. 'The thought of leaving her behind, of leaving the baby behind hurts. I’m ready to do something about this weight. I need to get it off or I’m going to die.’ Nissa added: ‘Marriage is extremely difficult when you are married to someone who weighs over 600lb. 'We don’t have any intimate relationship – our marriage is much more caregiver/patient. He eats enough to feed 20 people. Chuck, pictured awaiting his surgery in the specialist hospital with wife Nissa, had his stomach reduced to just 2.4 ounces during the procedure . ‘I just feel like a servant. Being a single mum is one thing, but being a single mum when there’s another human being there is much harder. 'Our family won’t last much longer if something doesn’t change. I want Chuck to get help. I would like for him to have a happy life and have an opportunity to live.' Sure that weight loss surgery was his only option, Chuck made the decision to travel to a hospital in Houston that specialises in performing weight loss procedures on the morbidly obese. Speaking ahead of the operation, surgeon Dr Nowzaradan said: ‘Chuck has very unhealthy eating habits and if they continue then surgery won’t be a good option for him.’ At Dr Nowzaradan’s insistence, Chuck embarked on a liquid diet to lose 35lb before going under the knife in a bid to make surgery less risky. A month after surgery Chuck lost a further 21lb, which is less than expected after such a drastic procedure . Although the surgery was a success, Chuck admits that the first few months after the operation were hard for him to handle. ‘I thought the surgery would take away the cravings, but it hasn’t been that easy. I’m eating less but I still like good food that tastes good. 'Now that the surgery is over and done with, I know what I can eat and how much I can eat. if you’ve eaten more than you’re supposed to it will really make you sick.’ Despite his struggles, a year after the operation, Chuck says he's feeling better than ever and says his dramatic weight loss has helped him rethink his life. ‘It has been really hard,' he admits. 'It is a . very scary reality. I better wake up and get serious. I always thought I . was my weight that was the issue, but the reason I put it on was . because of thing I hadn’t dealt with. 'I . know I have to come to terms with so many of my issues to get my life . in order. I don’t know why I get angry like I do. I just lash out, and . Nissa doesn’t deserve it and I feel so bad when I do. Chuck initially struggled to readjust his diet after surgery, and his recovery and lack of motivation put a great strain on his marriage . Nissa moving out of the house and threatening him with divorce was a turning point for Chuck, and he began to exercise and stick to his diet . Chuck continued to lose weight, going under the knife for a second time to remove excess skin and his lymphodema, with his dedication encouraging Nissa to give their marriage another try . 'I . realised there was a lot of pain I hadn’t dealt with and it’s been . eating away at me, creating this anger inside me and driving me to food. So . many of my issues come from not dealing with the death of my first . wife. He added: 'My whole life is changed and I feel like a new man. I’m on the road to being a better husband and father. 'Losing the weight has given me a sense of movement, freedom and confidence. Now I know I can financially provide for my family . A year ago I was a walking dead man. Weight loss surgery has saved my life. I know I have a long way to go but I also know I can do it.

Flat fashion: Victoria Beckham, known for her penchant for sky scraper heels, has been shunning her favourite footwear in favour of flats lately . Giorgio Armani championed flats at his Milan Fashion Week show, opting for classic black velvet with the occasional jolt of silver. Trussardi offered more androgynous flats, sending models down the catwalk in monochrome brogues toughened up with gold buckles and fringing. Victoria, 39, once . said she 'couldn't concentrate in flats' and 'beyond hated' ballet shoes but has had to learn to love them after being told to ditch the heels in 2011. She suffered a slipped disc following . the birth of daughter Harper Seven and was under doctor's . orders to wear comfortable shoes. Since then, other celebrities have been ditching the heels including Poppy . Delevingne and Olivia Palermo who opted to wear sensible flats at the Anya Hindmarch show this season. Low heights: Models took to the runway at the Giorgio Armani show, left, and Trussardi, right, in - shock horror - flats! Socialite . Poppy adorned her feet with a now sold-out pair of heart-print . calf-hair slippers from Burberry, which retail at £350. The shoes have a . mirrored gold heel and a red satin insole. Meanwhile, It-girl Olivia, 27, stuck to a black Aladdin-inspired pair of slippers which were covered in jewels. Always one to be ahead of the trend, Alexa Chung, who has long championed flats, was spotted out and about over London Fashion Week in comfortable footwear. The presenter has, however, swapped her much-loved ballet pumps for more on-trend New Balance trainers. Shoebusiness: Poppy Delevingne, left, . and Olivia Palermo, centre, both wore slipper shoes to the Anya Hindmarch fashion . show held at the Tate Modern on Tuesday . But can flat shoes ever be as stylish or flattering as heels? Speaking about the new trend, Alex Longmore, celebrity stylist and Hotter shoes Ambassador, said: 'I for one am so pleased to see that flat shoes are taking centre stage at all the runway shows in Milan. 'I love the wedge soled punk-esque wedge flats at Trussardi and T-bar flats at Dolce. 'I’m not surprised this trend is becoming so big, it’s been creeping in for a few past seasons now: Brogues have been big news for a while, so has the loafer having its own style revival this summer. 'Charlotte Olympia's kitten flats have been seen on every celebrity from Fearne Cotton to Beyoncé. Alexa Chung is a trailblazer for flats choosing to ditch high heels and wear the look for formal events. Queen of flats: Alexa Chung has long championed flat shoes - even wearing them to smart events . 'The high street have some great flat styles out there right now, my favourite being the black suede loafers from Hotter. 'Finally we have a trend that makes sense, every woman wants to be comfortable and look stylish at the same time. With more women leading demanding lives, gone are the days running for the bus in a pair of towering Jimmy Choo heels. 'I think here has always been a bit of a taboo about how flats can't be flattering, but with the right trouser leg length or skirt length, this can actually be an incredibly flattering shoe and make anybodys legs look longer. 'Bring on the flats I say and the sooner the better.' Urban chic: Alexa has ditched her once favoured ballet pumps to embrace the sport's luxe trend in the form of New Balance trainers . Thomas Merrigan, menswear writer at OxbloodAndWolf.Wordpress.com, said: 'It is undeniable that there is an attraction to a women in heels. Although I would say that this is often radiated by their own self confidence, which comes with wearing them. 'Flat shoes on a woman can also be attractive, especially in adapted traditionally masculine silhouettes, such as a brogue or penny loafer a la Alexa Chung.'

A teacher shed nine stone after she was asked to leave a rollercoaster ride because she was too large for the safety bar to fasten. Secondary school teacher Claire Pettigrew weighed 23st and was size 24 at the time of the humiliating episode. She said: 'I tried desperately to pull the bar over my stomach but it just wouldn’t go down any further. Claire managed to shed an astonishing 9st in just 18 months by overhauling her diet . 'My cheeks turned bright red when the ride attendant told me to leave. 'I forced a smile onto my face and told the 14- and 15-year-old pupils I was supervising I was too scared to go on the ride. They burst out laughing. 'Luckily, they didn’t hear the real reason. When I got home I was too embarrassed to even tell my husband.' Mrs Pettigrew, 27, of Glasgow, struggled with weight gain since childhood and had a habit of snacking on sweet treats despite her mother’s encouragement to eat healthily. She said: 'I’d never been a skinny girl. After school I ate sandwiches and crisps before my mum and dad got home. I was always hungry.' When Mrs Pettigrew was 18 she met her husband Martin, 32, a cleaner, at a nightclub. But as she settled comfortably into her new loving relationship her overeating went from bad to worse. Claire dropped from 23st 3lb (right) to 13st 12lb (left) by ditching her unhealthy diet of junk food . As Claire settled comfortably into her new loving relationship with husband Martin, pictured, her overeating went from bad to worse . She said: 'We got into the habit of having takeaways and meals out. Martin didn’t worry about my size and I felt comfortable enough not to focus on my weight. 'At work I’d spend breaks snacking on sweets, biscuits, crisps and thick cheese sandwiches. 'When we met I was a size 16 but when we got married three years later I was wearing size 24 clothes. 'Our wedding day was wonderful but even now when I look at the photos I feel sad that I was that big.' Claire pictured with her son Nathan who was her inspiration for sticking to her diet and losing the weight . Three years after getting married Mrs Pettigrew gave birth to her first child, Nathan, now two. She said: 'By the time I had Nathan my weight had gone up to 20st. I became increasingly self-conscious. I was convinced everyone was looking at me.' Two months after the rollercoaster incident, which occurred at the Lightwater Valley theme park in Ripon in October 2011, Mrs Pettigrew decided to turn her life around. She said: 'Nathan was nine months old and was crawling around everywhere, I was struggling to keep up with him and was really struggling to catch my breath. 'I was seriously worried that I wouldn’t be able to keep up with him when he started walking. The thought was just too much to bear.' Mrs Pettigrew joined Slimming World in January 2012. At 23st 3lb, the challenge was daunting. In her first week she lost an impressive 9lb which spurred her into action. Claire shows off the results of her weight loss, having ditched the snacking and oversized portions . She swapped unhealthy snacks of chocolate and cheese for healthier options. Before beginning her weight loss . journey, Mrs Pettigrew typically ate buttery toast with sugared coffee . for breakfast, cheese sandwiches with crisps and chocolate for lunch, . followed by a ready meal with oven chips for evening meal. She would . snack throughout the day from a family-sized bag of chocolate. Claire says she is now embarrassed about the amounts she used to eat . Today, she eats a cereal bar and coffee with sweetener for breakfast, with lean chilli or vegetables in homemade sauce for lunch, and stir fry or reduced-fat curry for dinner. She enjoys an occasional cup of lighter hot chocolate for a snack. She said: 'I stocked up on fresh fruit and veg and lean meat. Luckily the diet I followed still allowed me to have big portions of pasta in a tomato sauce, so I never felt hungry. Every time I felt like giving up, I looked at my son and reminded myself why I was doing it.' In only 18 months she shed a massive 9st, bringing her down to 13st 12lb - a healthy weight for her 5ft 11in height. She says: 'I’m ashamed I used to eat the amount I did. I would never eat all that chocolate again. 'Martin tells me how proud he is of me and I’m finally happy with the way I look. 'People used to say it was a shame I was so big because I was a pretty girl. I’m glad I will never have to hear those words again. I’m happy in my own skin and I no longer worry what people think. 'I love being able to wear figure-hugging clothes and most of all I’m proud that I can play and run around with Nathan.

First Lady Michelle Obama attempted to connect with schoolchildren across the country by rapping about healthy eating habits as she announced new rules that would limit the marketing of unhealthy foods in schools. The rules would phase out the advertising of sugary drinks and junk foods around campuses during the school day and ensure that other promotions in schools were in line with health standards that already apply to school foods. That means a scoreboard at a high school football or basketball game eventually wouldn't be allowed to advertise Coca-Cola, for example, but it could advertise Diet Coke or Dasani water, which is also owned by Coca-Cola Co. Scroll down for video... Promoting healthy eating: US First Lady Michelle Obama speaks during an announcement of proposed school wellness standards in the East Room of the White House in Washington .

Same . with the front of a vending machine. Cups, posters and menu boards . which promote foods that don't meet the standards would also be phased . out. Ninety percent of such marketing in schools is related to beverages, and many soda companies already have started to transition their sales and advertising in schools from sugary sodas and sports drinks to their own healthier products. Mrs Obama performed some lyrics to a rap song that were written by kids at a school in Virginia. The jam shows all the benefits of healthy eating, including a healthy brain. Reason to celebrate: Tuesday¿s announcement marks  the fourth anniversary of the first lady¿s Let¿s Move initiative, which seeks to combat childhood obesity by promoting healthy food choices and exercise .

'If I'm going to help my brain come to fruition, . I'm going to feed it quality nutrition. We love the cookies but they're not sufficient, . We need to eat veggies to make our bodies efficient. Roll my chicken in a wrap, don't jam it in a nugget. Get hyped for healthy snacks, fresh food, we love it!' Source: Students of Marshall High School, Virginia . The proposed rules are part of first . lady Michelle Obama's Let's Move initiative to combat child obesity, . which is celebrating its fourth anniversary this week. Mrs. Obama and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack announced the new rules at a White House event. 'The idea here is simple — our classrooms should be healthy places where kids aren't bombarded with ads for junk food,' the first lady said in a statement released before the announcement. ""Because when parents are working hard to teach their kids healthy habits at home, their work shouldn't be undone by unhealthy messages at school.' The rules also would allow more children access to free lunches and ensure that schools have wellness policies in place. The proposed rules come on the heels of USDA regulations that are now requiring foods in the school lunch line to be healthier. Rules set to go into effect next school year will make other foods around school healthier as well, including in vending machines and separate 'a la carte' lines in the lunch room. Calorie, fat, sugar and sodium limits will have to be met on almost every food and beverage sold during the school day at 100,000 schools. Concessions sold at afterschool sports games would be exempt. The healthier food rules have come under fire from conservatives who think the government shouldn't dictate what kids eat — and from some students who don't like the healthier foods. Banned: Under the proposed rules, companies would be limited in what products they could advertise on signs, vending machines, cups and menu boards on school grounds . Down the kids: First lady Michelle Obama recites a 'wrap' song written by students  about healthy eating  as she announced proposed guidelines for local school wellness policies . Aware of the backlash, the USDA is allowing schools to make some of their own decisions on what constitutes marketing and asking for comments on some options. For example, the proposal asks for comments on initiatives like Pizza Hut's 'Book It' program, which coordinates with schools to reward kids with pizza for reading. Rules for other school fundraisers, like bake sales and marketing for those events, would be left up to schools or states. Off-campus fundraisers, like an event at a local fast-food outlet that benefits a school, still would be permitted. But posters advertising the fast food may not be allowed in school hallways. An email to parents — with or without the advertising — would have to suffice. The idea is to market to the parents, not the kids. The rule also makes allowances for major infrastructure costs — that scoreboard advertising Coca-Cola, for example, wouldn't have to be immediately torn down. But the school would have to get one with a healthier message the next time it was replaced. Positive marketing only: Snapple is the exclusive beverage in city public schools as well as at parks and other public areas. For $166 million Snapple will promote New York - all over a five year period, with most money going to the schools). Only water and juices will be sold in the schools . The beverage industry — led by Coca-Cola Co., Dr. Pepper Snapple Group and PepsiCo — is on board with the move. American Beverage Association President and CEO Susan Neely said in a statement that aligning signage with the healthier drinks that will be offered in schools is the ""logical next step."" ""Mrs. Obama's efforts to continue to strengthen school wellness make sense for the well-being of our schoolchildren,"" Neely said. Although Mrs. Obama lobbied Congress to pass the school nutrition bill in 2010, most of her efforts in recent years have been focused on the private sector, building partnerships with food companies and retailers to sell healthier foods. Meeting of minds: Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, left, introduces JoAnne Hammermaster, from Vienna, Virginia., who is co-founder and president of Real Food For Kids, and her son Sam Hammermaster, before first lady Michelle Obama announced proposed guidelines for local school wellness policies . The child nutrition law also expanded feeding programs for hungry students. The rules being proposed Tuesday would increase that even further by allowing the highest-poverty schools to serve lunch and breakfast to all students for free. According to the USDA and the White House, that initiative would allow 9 million children in 22,000 schools to receive free lunches. The USDA has already tested the program, which is designed to increase participation for students and reduce paperwork and applications for schools, in 11 states. In addition, the Obama administration will announce new guidelines for school wellness policies. Schools have been required to have general wellness policies that set their own general standards for foods, physical activity and other wellness activities since 2004. But the new rules would require parents and others in the school community to be involved in those decisions.","First Lady performed a rap song written by school kids designed to promote healthy eating .

Sports brand Adidas has had to stop selling World Cup t-shirts that used sexualised stereotypes to promote host Brazil. One t-shirt on sale on the company’s website bore the slogan ’Lookin' to Score,’ featuring a woman in a bikini in front of a Rio de Janerio beach, and the word ‘Brazil’. Another said ‘I (heart) Brazil,’ where the heart was designed to resemble a woman’s behind wearing a thong bikini. Pulled: The t-shirts were removed by Adidas after being slammed by both Brazil's tourism board and the country's ministry of women's affairs for being degrading to Brazilian woman and promoting sex tourism . Adidas made the announcement just hours after Brazil's tourism board released a statement condemning the merchandise. Adidas, a World Cup sponsor and supplier of the official ball for the tournament, said in a statement the products were limited edition T-shirts available only in the United States. ‘Adidas always pays close attention to the opinion of its consumers and partners,’ the company said. ‘Therefore, it is announcing that these products will not be sold anymore.’ The T-shirts were not available on the site on Tuesday shortly after Brazilian media published images of them. The tourism board said the Brazilian government is ‘vehemently’ against anything that ‘links Brazil's image to sex appeal,’ and said officials are working hard to repress ‘sexual tourism’ during the World Cup. Taking a stand: Dilma Rousseff, Brazil's first female President, posted poignant tweets after the tourism board's statement, promising to fight sex tourism during the World Cup . Brazil's first woman President, Dilma Rousseff, tweeted that the nation will be doing its utmost to prevent sexual tourism during the football cup. ‘Brazil is happy to welcome the tourists that will arrive for the World Cup, but it is also ready to fight against sexual tourism,’ she said. She was backed up by the nation's ministry of women's affairs which accused the merchandise of being offensive to Brazilian women and exposing them to 'sexual predators'. This is all the more shocking in a country that just elected a women as its highest authority, which brought greater respect for women and zero tolerance for any form of violence against them,' a ministry statement said. ‘We want to make it very clear to our main commercial partners in tourism that Brazil does not tolerate this type of crime in its territory,’ said Flavio Dino, president of the tourism board Embratur. ‘This campaign goes against what Brazil defends. Our effort is to promote Brazil for its natural and cultural attributes. ‘An initiative like this one ignores and disrespects the message the government is trying to get across.’ ‘None of our campaigns will ever use any image or message that uses sexual connotation or promotes this criminal action,’ the board said in its statement. The World Cup is being held in Brazil from June 12 until July 13. It is the first time since 1950 the South American nation is hosting the tournament.

An elementary school teacher has come under fire for filming and taunting an autistic boy who became stuck in a chair rather than helping him. Nicole McVey reached for her cell phone when the 11-year-old boy, who has Asperger's syndrome, became caught through a chair at Oaktree Elementary School in Goodrich, Michigan last November. The footage shows that, as he struggled to free himself, McVey asked him how he became caught in the chair and whether he wanted to get Tasered. The school's principal, Michael Ellis, was also in the room at the time and can be heard chipping in. Scroll down for video . Distressed: A video recorded by a teacher shows a student with Asperger's syndrome mocking a boy, 11, who had become stuck in a chair while the head teacher chimes in. They then sent the video to other staff . When McVey tells the boy that a maintenance worker is on the way to help, Ellis says: 'It's not really an emergency in their book.' The maintenance worker then arrived to remove the . child from the chair. Patrick Greenfelder, an attorney for the boy's parents, told ABC12 that McVey then showed the video to . the class and Ellis emailed it to other staff members and some friends. 'You hear of bullying by other students . and other kids in class, I have had cases like this before, but I have . never had a case with teachers and administrators bullying,' Greenfelder . said. Hearing: The school board has voted to seek to fire McVey, while the principal has already quit . Support: Many parents at the board meeting said they think McVey is a great teacher and not a bully . It is not clear why McVey recorded the incident. Her attorney has advised her not to comment. After administrators saw the video, the Goodrich School Board voted to accept Ellis' resignation and seek to fire McVey by filing tenure charges. But the decision has upset some in the Goodrich school community, and numerous parents attended a board meeting on Monday with signs in support of McVey. 'I know she is supported by the community, the other teachers, the staff, I have learned a lot from her and I support her fully,' said Leanne Ruediger, a substitute teacher whose children attend the school. 'I believe that Nicole's intentions and motivations are always in the right place.' Another parent added: 'There's no way that Mrs McVey ever bullied any child in that class.' Scene: She is on leave from the elementary school in Oaktree Elementary in Goodrich, Michigan . They added that the word 'Taser' does not refer to a stun gun in the classroom context, but when you take two fingers and use them in a tickling motion on someone's side. The parents of the boy said they were upset by the support she was getting, and said they did not like the use of the word Taser. 'Our son did nothing wrong, but yet this seems to be another case of blaming the victim,' they added. They are considering a lawsuit. McVey is on paid administrative leave while private tenure hearings debating her future at the school take place.","Nicole McVey recorded and mocked the boy, who has Asperger's syndrome, while the principal Michael Ellis chipped in .

Mexico's most powerful drug cartel leader employed high-tech communications gadgetry and sophisticated counterespionage practices to elude an international manhunt for 13 years, according to a news agency. In the end, however, life on the run unraveled for Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman in a decidedly low-tech way. A traditional wiretap in southern Arizona pointed authorities to a cellphone being used by a top associate. Within a day, Guzman was captured in a high-rise beachfront condominium in Mazatlan, Mexico. Scroll down for video . El Chapo opens his mouth for a DNA test after his detention in Mexico City . Guzman's penchant for technology and . his efforts to stay ahead of the law were described to the Associated Press by a . senior law enforcement official with direct knowledge of Guzman's years . on the run and by a U.S. government official who was briefed on the . case. Both spoke only on condition of anonymity because they were not . authorized to discuss the situation by name. 'He didn't spare any expenses when it came to protecting himself,' the law enforcement official said. Some . of the communications equipment Guzman used was not generally available . to consumers. The sophistication of the gear and Guzman's diligence . deeply impressed investigators who were pursuing him. Among other . practices, Guzman employed countersurveillance scanners to detect . transmitters hidden in rooms or carried by people with whom he was . meeting. 'It was top-notch,' the law enforcement official said. Because . Guzman was so well protected, he managed to attend family events and . marry a local beauty queen in a well-attended bash in his home state of . Sinaloa, all while keeping his multinational, billion-dollar drug empire . thriving. El Chapo is escorted to a helicopter in handcuffs by Mexican navy marines at a navy hanger in Mexico City . U.S. and Mexican . officials spent years hunting for a weak spot in his network. The U.S. government official said the Drug Enforcement Administration and . Immigration and Customs Enforcement used traditional wiretaps to zero in . on Guzman. At times in the last year, agents were able to intercept . BlackBerry messages and other communications. Earlier . this month, authorities raided one of Guzman's suspected hideouts in . Culiacan, the capital city of Sinaloa, where Guzman operated with near . impunity. Inside, they found a cellphone belonging to his communications . chief, which helped lead to a trusted courier, the government official . said. The courier later . described for authorities a series of houses Guzman used as hideouts. At . least one other arrest pointed Guzman's pursuers to the Pacific Coast . city of Mazatlan. The most . important clue came from an ICE wiretap monitored in Nogales, Ariz. That . information directed Mexican marines to the exact condominium where . Guzman had been hiding since outrunning troops days earlier through . interconnected tunnels beneath his Culiacan hideouts. The officials would not discuss the specific methods used over the last 13 years. Computer aided: These photographs, taken from El Chapo's 1993 and 2014 detentions, show identification mapping marks that proved to Mexican authorities that the man they'd arrested was indeed the drug lord .

The . law enforcement official said Guzman wasn't holed up in the rugged . mountains of western Mexico while on the run. With the help of his own . trusted security force and the likely assistance of some Mexican . authorities, Guzman had moved freely about parts of Mexico and even . internationally. 'He moved . for the most part with impunity (in Culiacan),' the official said. 'He . traveled at will. He had private planes. He was a businessman and he . would go and meet people to discuss not just the drug trade. He was . obviously interested in the money trade, the markets. He was looking at . expanding the empire.' By . the time of his capture, Guzman's empire stretched from Canada through . Latin America, Europe, parts of Asia and Australia. He is believed to . have amassed a fortune worth billions. U.S. and Mexican authorities were close to nabbing Guzman in the past but . arrived at resorts or other locations hours or days too late, the law . enforcement official said. They were never closer than in recent weeks. Last . week, Guzman's pursuers were on his heels during raids at the stash . houses in Culiacan. The law enforcement official said Guzman was . believed to be just ahead of Mexican troops when he vanished in the . underground network below the houses before absconding to the high-rise . condo in Mazatlan, along the coast. El . Chapo appears set to remain in Mexico's highest-security prison for the . foreseeable future, as the government puts off U.S. extradition in a . move that could bolster President Enrique Pena Nieto's nationalist . credentials but also shine a spotlight on the country's woeful judicial . system. Experts say Pena . Nieto's administration and those of his predecessors have proven unable . to match headline-grabbing arrests like Guzman's with complex, long-term . investigations and prosecutions of deep-rooted criminal networks. Cases . have stalled and cartels have continued to operate. Last year, one of . Guzman's closest allies walked out of the prison where the U.S. said he . was running drugs from behind bars. The . Mexican government says there is no way Guzman will repeat the 2001 . escape that let him roam western Mexico for 13 years as he moved . billions of dollars of cocaine, methamphetamine and heroin around the . world. Authorities here say they want to be the first to interrogate Guzman, and use the information to dismantle his Sinaloa cartel. Two . federal judges ruled Tuesday that Guzman will have to stand trial on . separate drug-trafficking and organized-crime charges in Mexico. Pena . Nieto's administration said the man widely considered the world's . most-powerful drug lord until his capture Saturday will face at least . six other pending criminal cases before it even considers extraditing . him to the U.S. 'I don't . think it's going to happen anytime soon,' Attorney General Jesus Murillo . Karam said in a radio interview. 'This is the start of a full . investigation that will allow us to fully eradicate his organization. It . would be pointless to do anything else.'

U.S. prosecutors have proven far . more capable of offering captured drug lords the incentives to cooperate . with law enforcement, experts said. U.S. officials routinely use family members as tools to pressure defendants . into giving up information, granting visas to relatives of cooperative . prisoners while threatening to leave loved ones penniless by freezing . assets of drug lords who refuse to play ball. Mexican . authorities arrested Guzman, 56, along with his 20-something former . beauty-queen wife and twin toddlers, but let her go because there were . no charges pending against her. Observers called it a staggering missed . opportunity that wouldn't have occurred in the U.S. 'The . U.S. attorneys have many tools. They're pretty good at flipping people. They can offer far more things than the Mexican authorities can offer,' said Alejandro Hope, a security analyst and former official in Mexico's . domestic intelligence service.

A three-judge federal appeals court in the western state of Jalisco found that he should have been tried in state court, not federal, and vacated his sentence in a ruling widely seen by Mexican and U.S. officials as inexplicable and likely corrupt.","Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman escaped prison in 2001 and was caught again at weekend .

Former newspaper editor Kevin Lau has been rushed to hospital in critical condition after a machete attack . Police say Lau was slashed three times across the back and legs by a man wearing a crash helmet . Police are searching for two men in connection with the attack. 'One of them alighted from the motorcycle and used a chopper to attack the victim,' police spokesman Simon Kwan told reporters. 'He suffered three wounds, one in his back and two in his legs,' Mr Kwan said, adding that the back wound was deep. Police did not announce any motive for the attack and appealed to the public for information. Lau was replaced last month after criticising the Chinese government over human right's abuses . The attack has sparked a fresh wave of protests in the city as supporters of Lau hold candlelight vigils . Lau, 49, was named editor of the respected Ming Pao newspaper in 2012 but was replaced last month by a Malaysian journalist with no local experience. Lau was transferred to the parent company's electronic publishing unit.

A 26-year-old protester in Ukraine has been hailed as the man who made up ousted president Viktor Yanukovich's mind to go on the run. Film producer Volodymyr Parasiuk commandeered the microphone on Friday night in Kiev to turn the crowd against an EU-brokered deal to end the conflict between Yanukovich and opposition leaders. With former boxing champion and opposition leader Vitaly Klitschko looking on stony-faced, Parasiuk, from the western city of Lviv, made an electrifying impromptu speech denouncing the opposition for 'shaking hands with this killer'. Opposition protester Volodymyr Parasiuk addresses the crowd as opposition leader Vitaly Klitschko (looks) looks on during a rally in Kiev on Friday . Parasiuk, who learned combat skills in the army cadets, may be recorded as the man who made up Viktor Yanukovich's mind to cut and run . Parasiuk, from the western city of Lviv, made an electrifying impromptu speech denouncing the opposition for 'shaking hands with this killer' No-one was going to wait for an election later in the year, he said. Yanukovich had to get out of town by the following morning or face the consequences. To the dismay of opposition leaders, Parasiuk's emotional address - he broke down on several occasions as he remembered dead comrades among the 80 killed - touched a chord deep within the thousands on Independence Square who roared their approval. The opposition had failed to sell their achievements to the 'Maidan', the name for both the square and the protest movement. An agreement, painstakingly negotiated with EU foreign ministers over a sleepless night, was effectively dead. The writing was on the wall for Yanukovich. He flew out of Kiev by helicopter that night, Ukraine's acting interior minister said, and on Tuesday was on the run somewhere in Ukraine, being sought for 'mass murder'. 'Opposition leaders said they had agreed that there would be early elections in December. This was the Ukrainian people's last drop of patience,' Parasiuk said. Photos of those killed in recent violence are seen at a make-shift memorial in Kiev's Independence Square . Members of self defence units stand guard at the parliament building in Kiev today . 'Emotions were overflowing because we had lost a great number of people. Suddenly these politicians come and say ""Yanukovich will stay as president and there will be elections."" I have a clear position. Yanukovich is a terrorist, Terrorist Number One, for Ukraine,' Parasiuk said. That Friday night, Yanukovich set off on a zig-zag by helicopter and car across eastern and southern Ukraine, looking either for a safe haven or a flight out of the country. Some believe he may have already decided he was going to flee even before the 'Maidan' gave thumbs-down to the agreement. Ukraine's opposition, buoyed by the direct intervention of three EU ministers from Germany, Poland and France, had signed an agreement that seemed to meet many of their demands.

Anti-government protesters man the front line barricades following yesterdays clashes with police in Independence Square . Fighting broke out on Friday between deputies in Ukraine's parliament when the speaker declared a pause, delaying a debate on a possible resolution calling for President Viktor Yanukovich's powers to be reduced . It provided for early elections, a national unity government and return to a previous constitution that would take away from Yanukovich control over the appointment of the prime minister and make-up of the government, and return it to parliament. Almost immediately, the parliament, where Yanukovich's grip had been weakened by desertions by deputies from his Party of Regions, began voting many of these proposals into law. Those who saw Yanukovich sign the deal saw an unsmiling figure unhappy about what he was giving away, and aware of the risk he ran in a rapidly-unfolding drama.

Anti-government protesters man the front line barricades following Friday's clashes with police in Independence square . 'It was as if he knew more about the dire straits he was in. He did not seem as invincible and aloof as he did before. He didn't look scared but he did not look so sure,' said one witness to the signing. Either way, when opposition leaders took the deal to the Maidan for definitive approval on Friday night, it blew up in their faces - thanks to Parasiuk's emotional intervention. Klitschko and other opposition leaders had already spoken of their achievements in putting a deal together. But there was a mixed reception from the Maidan. Booing, whistling and cat-calls gave Parasiuk his cue. As . the crowds carried open coffins of victims to the stage where he and . opposition leaders stood, Parasiuk, his voice breaking, jumped to the . microphone. Asked why he took the stage, Volodymyr Parasiuk said: 'It wasn’t out of ambition and it wasn't an heroic deed. I was just boiling over. When you realise that you have to push harder. 'When a glass falls, almost reaches the ground, and then suddenly someone tries to catch it right before it actually hits? We understood that this was what the opposition was doing. 'We realised that there was only one way, and it was to deliver an ultimatum. How could we even negotiate? The mothers of the fallen needed this kind of statement. 'That night we had been listening to the speeches from the balcony of the Conservatory building, and it was clear that we had to take the stage. The guys came up to me and said, ""Volodya, you are the oldest here, you will give the speech."" 'When I was heading to the stage, I did not think about anything. They did not let us pass at first. But when there are 50 people walking, everyone will notice. Klitshchko saw us from the stage and waved us through. 'I was at Maidan, I heard and saw what people think, so I understood what had to be said. I knew that everyone had reached the boiling point, but no one could express it. This is no heroic deed. The heroes are those who gave their lives for freedom in Ukraine. It happened spontaneously. 'It was clear that we needed to quit dabbling in politics and carrying on negotiations with this  terrorist. We all believe that Yanukovych is indeed a terrorist.' 'We ordinary people are saying this to the politicians who stand behind us: 'No Yanukovich is going to be a president for a whole year',' he said to roars of support from the crowd. 'Our kinsmen have been shot and our leaders shake hands with this killer. This is shame. Tomorrow, by 10 o'clock, he has to be gone,' Parasiuk declared. Yanukovich was, in fact, gone long before that, flying out of Kiev by helicopter that Friday night to the eastern city of Kharkiv, according to acting interior minister Arsen Avakov. Diplomatic insiders say Yanukovich may already have had doubts about whether the agreement could hold. Benefiting from intelligence on the streets, he knew how the wind was blowing. Two of the three main opposition leaders - former economy minister Arseny Yatsenyuk and far-right nationalist Oleg Tyahnibok - left the stage quickly after Parasiuk's speech. Klitschko returned and apologised for shaking hands with Yanukovich. Though ousted by the fledgling new parliament, Yanukovich, appearing in the town of Kharkiv on Saturday, issued a televised statement saying he was still president. But the new authorities on Monday said he was now wanted for 'mass murder'. Some reports have him hiding in a monastery in Donetsk, though Reuters reporters on Monday saw no sign of unusual activity there. He might be in Crimea. Given Russia's Black Sea fleet has a base in Sevastopol, he might even be on a Russian ship, some people theorise. If Parasiuk had not made the intervention he did, someone else would have, one diplomat opined. Looking back on that heady Friday night, Parasiuk, who headed a 'self-defence' unit with a membership of between 40 and 130 fighters, defended his sharp criticism of Klitschko and the other opposition leaders. 'Everything that had been achieved had been by the people of the Maidan. But they had achieved nothing,' he said in an interview in a restaurant in downtown Kiev. Parasiuk, a single man with a disarming smile whose girlfriend, Iryna, sat with him, said he had participated 'actively' in clashes with police though he declined to say what weapons he had used. He defended the power of the 'Maidan' with the passion of an 18th century French revolutionary. Asked when Kiev's barricades would come down, he replied: 'If the Maidan disperses, politicians will stop being afraid. We are not going away. We will not allow a repeat of what happened in 2004,' he said. He was referring to the Orange Revolution of 2004-5 which stopped Yanukovich's first bid for the presidency but produced governments that collapsed amid in-fighting and allowed him to come to power in 2010. He spelled out a message that Ukraine's emerging leadership may have to heed carefully as it strives to make a peaceful transition to a post-Yanukovich order. The new authorities, he said, must understand that the Maidan is the real power, not the 450 parliamentary deputies. 'My declaration from the stage had one aim: to tell the opposition: 'Understand this. That if you do not fulfil our conditions then things will be as we decide, not as you decide'.' 'We simply told them: ""Lads, act decisively because if you don't, we will"",' Parasiuk said.","Volodymyr Parasiuk made electrifying speech at a rally on Friday night .

Germany's top court on Wednesday scrapped a rule that political parties need at least three per cent of the vote to enter the European Parliament, opening the door to far-right and extremist organisations winning seats in a May 25 election. The government lowered the threshold to three per cent last year from five per cent, but the Constitutional Court ruled this was unconstitutional and abolished the hurdle altogether, saying it infringed parties' right to equal opportunities. A group of small parties had asked the court to review the three per cent barrier, saying it was unfair and put off potential supporters. Five of the judges on the panel of eight agreed, arguing that each voter must have the same right to determine the composition of the European Parliament. There are fears changes to European Parliament voting in Germany could lead to extremist parties gaining seats. Pictured, neo-Nazis march through the streets of Berlin during a protest in November, 2000 . 'The three percent threshold is unconstitutional... the deep infringement it made on equal electoral rights and equal opportunities was unjustifiable,' the court said in its ruling. Lawmakers from the German Bundestag and the European Parliament had defended the hurdle arguing that without such a filter it would be harder for the chamber to function, but the judges said such fears were unfounded. The ruling has no bearing on national German elections where a five percent threshold applies, said Justice Minister Heiko Maas. He said the court had argued that since the European Parliament did not form a government, giving each party a fair chance was even more important. In a previous ruling, the court said the German lower house of parliament has an absolute need for consensus and majorities in order to legislate, whereas this was not the case to the same extent with the European Parliament. 'The point of the threshold was to avoid any fragmenting of the European Parliament. The parliament's increased importance means it needs a stable majority,' said Thomas Oppermann, head of the Social Democrats (SPD) bloc in the German parliament. Germany will elect 96 lawmakers to the European Parliament, the largest national contingent. Without the hurdle, a score of one per cent of the vote will be enough to secure a party a seat . He said the ruling left major parties with a responsibility to make sure extremists and the far-right did not win seats. Opinion polls have suggested Eurosceptical and fringe groups, including the Alternative for Germany (AfD), could perform well in many countries in the European elections and potentially disrupt the mainstream political blocs. Parties set to benefit without the hurdle include the anti-establishment Pirates, the Free Voters, who advocate Swiss-style referendums on policy issues, and the Ecological Democratic Party. 'Equal representation of every single, valid vote is the core principle of democracy,"" said Gerald Haefner, chairperson of campaign group Democracy International. The ruling means 'citizens' votes for smaller political parties will be fully respected instead of being swept under the carpet', he added. Germany will elect 96 lawmakers to the European Parliament, the largest national contingent. Without the hurdle, a score of one per cent of the vote will be enough to secure a party a seat under Germany's proportional representation system. The mainstream parties have long argued that electoral thresholds are needed to avoid political fragmentation in parliament of the kind that helped bring down the Weimar Republic and made way for the rise of Adolf Hitler. National voting systems for the European Parliament differ across the 28 member states. Most countries, including Britain, Spain, Portugal and the Netherlands, have no threshold. Eight nations have a five per cent threshold - the maximum allowed under EU law - including the Czech Republic, Poland and Romania.","Parties no longer need three per cent of vote to enter European Parliament .

A pensioner who died after his Halifax bank account was drained of £50,000 by his own grandson has had to fight a legal battle from ‘beyond the grave’ to get it back. John Bowden, 73, from Failsworth, Greater Manchester, was in hospital when he discovered Michael Howes, 25, had set up an online banking facility to secretly steal his savings over a two-year period. On his deathbed, the retired engineer urged his family to get the money back from the bank before he passed away from organ failure. John Bowden (left with his great granddaughter), 73, who died after his Halifax account was drained of £50,000 by his grandson, Michael Howes (right), has had to fight a legal battle from 'beyond the grave' to get it back . This photograph shows Mr Bowden Snr and his grandson, Michael Howes, together in 1994 . But when relatives urged the Halifax - which has the slogan ‘giving you extra’ - to refund the money into Mr Bowden’s estate due it to be withdrawn illegally, staff intially refused, saying no money was due because the account holder was now 'deceased'. The family had to fight for up to four months before the bank agreed to pay up. Jobless Howes, 25, who was taking up to £2,000 a time from his grandfather’s account to fund a lavish lifestyle, is now serving 21 months after pleading guilty to theft. But he is now set to inherit a share of his grandfather’s will because Mr Bowden was too ill to change it before his death. Today, as the Halifax apologised, Mr Bowden’s son, John Jnr, 40, from Oldham, Greater Manchester, said: ‘I can’t believe nobody at the bank picked up on the fact that a 73-year-old man had suddenly set up online banking and was spending so much money in such a short space of time. ‘No one told him something appeared to be wrong with his account until it was too late. The bank should have realised something was amiss and investigated sooner. When I first realised how much money Michael had stolen I was absolutely blown away. ‘When I went into my local Halifax with my dad’s death certificate I thought everything would be okay and that the money would be put back into my dad’s account. ‘But the bank told me that because my dad wasn’t here to make a statement they wouldn’t be able to give the money back. ‘I was shocked. It was bad enough being betrayed by a member for the family, but it seemed we were being betrayed all over again by certain people in the bank. I would have thought the bank would have investigated sooner. ‘Everyone was telling me to give up. They all said the same: ""You can’t beat the banks, you can’t beat the banks."" But I had promised my dad I would get the money back for him and there was no way that I was going to give up.’ John Bowden Jnr said: 'I can't believe nobody at the bank picked up on the fact that a 73-year-old man had suddenly set up online banking and was spending so much money in such a short space of time' The thefts emerged in July last year while Mr Bowden Snr was in an induced coma after suffering two heart attacks. His son opened two letters addressed to his father confirming overdraft amounts on his bank account. It was later discovered that Howes, who was living with Mr Bowden Snr at his home, had stolen £50,533 from the account by setting up online banking and making transfers into his own personal account. He spent the money on nights out, tattoos, gambling, designer clothes and a holiday to Turkey. Mr Bowden Snr was readmitted to hospital after complications over his heart surgery and died from organ failure the following October - a month before his grandson pleaded guilty to theft. He was jailed in December. The thefts emerged in July last year while Mr Bowden Snr (pictured here at his son's wedding last year), was in an induced coma after suffering two heart attacks . Mr Bowden Jnr, a roofer who is Howes’s uncle, said: ‘Once I had looked through the bank statements I contacted Halifax straightaway and they told me that if Michael was prosecuted and convicted we would get the money back. ‘My dad passed away on October 15, but I had to wait until Michael was jailed on the December 15 before I could do anything. But even then I visited the Oldham branch countless times and they didn’t seem to be able to help me and told me they wouldn’t pay out as my father and died. ‘I couldn’t believe it. I had done everything they had asked and now they were telling me it wasn’t going to be. I called the bank ombudsman and they told me I had to lodge an official complaint and give Halifax eight weeks to investigate. ‘For a whole week I called Halifax and wrote complaints to them on Facebook and Twitter. I was absolutely determined. The money was meant to be an inheritance for the family and we wanted to make sure that it went to the right people. ‘I wasn’t bothered about the money because it’s not for me anyway. I was just set on getting the money back because I had promised my dad that I would...‘ . This photograph shows Mr Bowden Snr at work with a friend in 2012, when he was 72 years old . ‘Eventually I received a phone call asking me to go in and they showed me the money had been put back in. I broke down into tears in the middle of the bank. ‘It had gone all the way up to the chief executive and the money was back in my dad’s account. It was such a relief but I would give it all back now to have my dad back. I don’t feel like I will ever be happy again because I have lost my dad.’ ‘I am now trying to get Michael cut out of my dad’s will. One of the last things my dad said to me was to make sure Michael got nothing. It broke his heart. Michael was the apple of my dad’s eye. My dad would have given him anything he wanted. ‘At the very end my dad was too ill to change his will and we didn’t have the money to pay for the solicitor’s fees to get it changed, but I am now doing everything in my power to make sure that Michael gets nothing.’ Mr Bowden Jnr, 40, from Oldham, Greater Manchester, with a picture of his father . The Halifax said: ‘We are extremely sorry that Mr Bowden did not receive the level of service that we aim to provide. We could and should have provided him with more support while resolving this issue. ‘In situations such as Mr Bowden’s, where an account holder has passed away, we are still able to investigate potentially fraudulent activity at the request of a recognised authority of the account, such as an executor. ‘Since Mr Bowden has been able to provide the necessary documentation of his role as the executor of his father’s estate we have been able to take the necessary steps to undertake a thorough investigation. ‘The outcome of this is that we have been able to refund the transactions that were identified as being fraudulent, which amounted to £51,583 including the associated interest and charges.’ This photograph shows Mr Bowden Snr celebrating his 60th birthday with friends and his son in 2000 .","John Bowden, from Failsworth, Greater Manchester, was in hospital when he discovered Michael Howes, 25, had been stealing from his savings .

A Ugandan newspaper has published a list of the country's 'top 200' homosexuals a day after the president enacted harsh anti-gay legislation. The Red Pepper, a Ugandan tabloid, ran the names of 200 people it claims are homosexuals, including several who have not previously come out as gay, under the headline 'EXPOSED!' The list includes prominent Ugandan gay . activists such as Pepe Julian Onziema, as well as a . popular Ugandan hip-hop star and a Catholic priest. Scroll down for video . The Red Pepper, a tabloid in Uganda, has printed the names of 200 people it accuses of being homosexuals on its front page . The list, which appears under the headline EXPOSED!, features names of people not previously identified as gay . The news comes on the day after Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni signed a bill into law which punishes 'aggravated homosexuality' with life in prison. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the bill marked 'a tragic day for Uganda and for all who care about the cause of human rights' and warned that Washington could cut aid to the East African nation. He said: 'Now that this law has been enacted, we are beginning an internal review of our relationship with the Government of Uganda to ensure that all dimensions of our engagement, including assistance programs, uphold our anti-discrimination policies and principles and reflect our values.' Few Ugandans identify themselves publicly as gay, and the tabloid's publication of alleged homosexuals recalls a similar list published in 2010. A prominent Ugandan gay activist, David Kato, was killed after the Rolling Stone newspaper - which has no affiliation with the American magazine - called for him to be hanged. In 2011 the then-editor said he had 'no regrets' over the article, as it was exposing wrongdoing. The news comes just a day after the country's president signed harsh new anti-gay legislation . Yesterday president Yoweri Musaveni called homosexuality 'disgusting' as he signed the bill into law . A Ugandan judge later condemned the . outing of homosexuals in a country where gays face severe . discrimination, saying it amounted to an invasion of privacy. Today Jacqueline Kasha, a well-known Ugandan lesbian activist who is among those listed in the Red Pepper story, tweeted: 'The media witch hunt is back.' The bill originally proposed the death penalty for 'aggravated homosexuality,' defined as repeated gay sex between consenting adults and acts involving a minor, a disabled person or where one partner is infected with HIV. The law also calls for first-time offenders to be sentenced to 14 years in jail. In signing the bill, Museveni said the measure is needed because the West is promoting homosexuality in Africa, rejecting international criticism as interference in Uganda's internal affairs. Museveni accused 'arrogant and careless Western groups' of trying to recruit Ugandan children into homosexuality. In 2010 a now-defunct Ugandan paper Rolling Stone - which has no affiliation with the Us magazine - published a similar expose . David Kato (right) was beaten to death after another article in the same paper (left) called for him to be hanged . Ugandan police spokesman Patrick Onyango said on Tuesday that no homosexuals have been arrested since Museveni signed the bill but that at least two had been taken into custody since lawmakers passed the bill last December. Onziema, the gay activist, said he had counted up to six arrests and said that more than a dozen Ugandan homosexuals had fled the country since December over safety concerns. Homosexuality has long been criminalised in Uganda under a colonial-era law that outlawed sex acts 'against the order of nature.' Some Ugandan lawyers and activists have said they will challenge the law in court as unconstitutional and impossible to implement. The Ugandan law — which came just over a month after Nigeria passed a similar measure against gays — has been condemned around the world, although it is widely popular among Ugandans. U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay warned that the law would institutionalise discrimination and could encourage harassment and violence against gays.","Red Pepper tabloid published names and some pictures of 'homosexuals'

The Queen and the Duchess of Cornwall were full of festive cheer on a charity visit today - and even brought along their own baubles. On a rare joint engagement to open the new Barnardo's headquarters at Barkingside, Essex, the monarch and her daughter-in-law hung their decorations on the charity's brightly-coloured Christmas tree to the cheers of dozens of children helped by the organisation. Specially commissioned through the Royal Collection, the  Queen's was made from red velvet with her cypher sewn on in golden thread, while Camilla's was blue velvet decoration was embroidered in silver. Rare appearance: The Queen and The Duchess of Cornwall joined forces in a rare public appearance at the official opening of the new Barnardo's headquarters in Tanners Lane Barkingside, Essex . The Queen has been patron of the charity, which helps more than 200,000 vulnerable children in the UK each year, since 1983, while Camilla was appointed its president in 2007. As one of the largest children's charities in the country, due to celebrate its 150th anniversary in 2016, it has boasted a royal patron since 1902. The Queen and the Duchess arrived together this afternoon in a chauffeur-driven Bentley. The sovereign was wearing a white, lavender and baby blue tweed coat by Stewart Parvin and a Rachel Trevor-Morgan hat, while Camilla was wearing a dove grey coat and dress by Bruce Oldfield. The choice was particularly appropriate as Mr Oldfield, a long time royal designer, is an ex Barnardo's Boy himself and is now Vice President of the charity. Patrons: The Queen has been patron of the charity, which helps more than 200,000 vulnerable children in the UK each year, since 1983, while Camilla was appointed its president in 2007 . Decorations: The duo were handed a red stocking each - with For The Queen and For The Duchess sewn onto them - as a gift from the children . Matching accessories: Pearl earrings and necklaces were the order of the day for the royal pair . He said: 'We only did the final fitting last week and delivered it to the Duchess on Friday. I was very touched she chose to wear it today. 'Barnardo's is an unbelievable organisation that supported me throughout my childhood, my schooling and even helped me, financially, to start my own business at the age of 25. 'We've been together for 63 years.' The Duchess clearly agreed when she met him, saying: 'It's a fantastic organisation, isn't it.' She and the Queen were shown round the new hi-tech headquarters, which has been built next to the original 'Girls' Village Home' created by Thomas Barnardo in 1873 to house a small group of vulnerable young women. Stylish: The sovereign was wearing a white, lavender and baby blue tweed coat by Stewart Parvin and a Rachel Trevor-Morgan hat . Although the organisation supports a wide variety of projects now, including those targeting the abuse and sexual exploitation of young children and others supporting young carers, the royals had asked for a briefing on another of its top priorities, the urgent need to recruit more adopters. Around 4,000 children are put up for adoption each year but many prospective parents are put off by the notoriously bureaucratic and inefficient system that currently operates. The situation is even worse for  children who are labelled 'hard to place', which includes youngsters from challenged backgrounds, siblings and older children. This year half of those on the Adoption Register were brothers and sisters, with just 35 per cent of adopters willing to consider more than one child. And with the average age of adoption being three years and eight months, children aged over four are suffering too. The proportion of children being adopted is one in three when the child is four, but that plummets to one in 15 when the child turns five. Race has also become an issue as a white child is three times more likely to be adopted than a black child, with the charity calling on more ethnic minority parents to come forward. Before they left, the Queen and the Duchess were given their baubles to hang on a tree in the HQ's foyer. 'They are lovely, aren't they? Are we going to put them on the tree?' The Queen asked her daughter-in-law. Tour: The duo were shown round the new hi-tech headquarters, which has been built next to the original 'Girls' Village Home' Honour: Acting Chief Executive Peter Brook described their visit as a 'huge honour' Joining in on the festivities: Queen Elizabeth II with The Duchess of Cornwall placing baubles on a Christmas tree during their visit .

Summer, seven, two sisters who are supported by the Barnardo's Basildon . Children's Centre. 'Is this for me?' The Queen asked. 'How lovely.' 'I suppose I am not allowed to peek am I,' said the Duchess. 'But aren't they gorgeous, huge fun. It even has my name on the front!' On trend: The sovereign was wearing a white, lavender and baby blue tweed coat by Stewart Parvin and a Rachel Trevor-Morgan hat . After a brief walkabout, collecting armfuls of flowers from well-wishers, the pair departed. Acting Chief Executive Peter Brook described the visit as a 'huge honour'. 'Her Majesty and the Duchess are very committed supporters of our work,' he said. 'In recent years our remit has changed enormously but the golden thread that runs through our work remains the same - and that's never to turn away a vulnerable child that needs our help.'

Downton Abbey is encouraging hosts to go back to old rules and traditions at the table, according to a new etiquette guide . Its influence could mark a move away from recent more casual dining habits, including snacking, sharing platters and takeaways. The trend has prompted electrical giant Samsung to team up with etiquette experts Debrett's to produce a posh guide to dining. It includes some rules and regulations that may come as a shock to those who like to throw together a casual, dress-down dinner party at the last minute. In Downton Abbey, the fictional Crawley family are regularly seen at grand dinner functions featuring countless courses and multiple wine glasses . Dinner party hosts are reminded that places should be set 20 inches apart, a host sits with the 'leading female guest' to his right and the hostess with the 'leading male guest' to her right. One should speak equally to those sitting on either side of them, which means switching from a guest on one side to the guest on the other in between courses. The guide also includes wine tips, including referring to red Bordeaux as claret, serving white wine chilled and always keep glasses filled so guests are not tempted to help themselves. Perhaps surprisingly, hosts are told not to make allowances for guests on diets - if they are watching the calories they can simply eat less, said Debrett's. A spokesperson for Samsung, said: 'More people are choosing to entertain friends and family at home and re-create dishes, inspired by celebrity chefs and cooking programmes.' A Debrett's etiquette advisor added: 'A well-organised host will plan every detail of a dinner party carefully, from the guest list and table arrangements to the menu and timings. 'Being a good host is hard work - it is about being aware of all of the guests all of the time, ensuring that they are well looked after and having a wonderful time.'

A mother from Connecticut is demanding an investigation take place into how her five-year-old son was picked up by another boy's great-grandfather. The mix-up was only spotted after the man's wife discovered that he had brought home the wrong child. The grandpa claimed that he had . mistakenly picked up the wrong kid because he was wearing a similar hat . and had it pulled down over his head! Now the parents of the first grader, . Everett Stone from Sterling, are demanding action by local officials and . that disciplinary action be taken against the staff at the school. Scroll down for video . Mixup: Angela and Derek Stone said their 5-year-old son was waiting for the bus at Sterling Community School on Friday when a man walked up to him and mistook the little boy for his own great-grandson and brought the boy to his house . Fuming: A great-grandfather brought the wrong boy home from a Connecticut school. Now, the boy's parents, Derek and Angela Stone are calling the administrators incompetent and demand the school take action . The grandfather picked up what he thought was his five-year-old grandson and ushered him into the car. The . duo clearly did not speak a word during the car journey, because it . wasn't until they arrived home that the error was noticed by the . eagle-eyed grandma. Angela Stone says her son refused to get out of the man's car at his home, and the man's wife noticed the mistake. He then drove the boy back to the school. 'Once the grand great-grandmother sees the boy and removes his hat, she realizes it's not her great-grandson and calls the school to say the great-grandfather has taken the wrong kid,' Stone said during an emergency Board of Education meeting held in Sterling on Tuesday night. Up until that point, the school had been unaware that little Everett was missing. Stone said her son arrived home in a state of shock and refused to talk about what had happened. 'This unbelievable and terrifying incident has placed a spotlight on the school's lack of security, particularly at bus pick-up and drop-off time,' she said. Angry: Venting her frustration, Angela Stone struggled to hold back tears as she spoke about the mix-up involving her 5-year-old son, Everett . Mixup: Mom Angela Stone pictures with her children. The five-year-old boy ended up going home with another man who was another boys' great-grandfather . Stone called school officials incompetent and says they should be disciplined. The boy's uncle, Paul Stone, told NBC News he was upset with how the school handled the incident. 'The school asked him to bring the child back,' Paul Stone explained. 'That was a totally inappropriate response. They should have, at that point, called authorities and had them go handle the child.' Her anxiety and fear turned into rage when that didn't happen. She said police and the Department of Children and Families only investigated at her request. 'Ms. Klebart and Mr. Musumeci have proven themselves incompetent leaders of our school,' said Stone. Joseph Musumeci is the principal of the Sterling Community School. Rena Klebart is the superintendent of the district. Stone told the Board of Education Tuesday night that she has no confidence in school leaders because school pickup has always been a problem. School Superintendent Rena Klebart, 63, acknowledges mistakes were made and says officials are making changes to prevent it from happening again. 'I do understand how upsetting this is,' said Sterling Superintendent. Rena Klebart. 'I understand how upset our staff is because we take our responsibility very seriously.' Klebart said the grandfather followed the school's policy by showing ID and signing out the correct student. Superintendent Rena Klebart: She says that student safety is a priority. 'We are very concerned with their safety and we want to be sure parents feel secure, students feel secure,' Klebart said . Policy: New rules have come into force that require parents to show ID and for the child to have a note stating who is picking them up at the end of the school day . Sterling School: The school has now changed its pickup policies to ensure a mixup like this is prevented from happening again . School staff members should have watched him retrieve the child, Klebart said, and that part of the incident is under investigation. 'Of course it's concerning. We are responsible for the safety of our children,' she said. 'Weâ€™ve increased the number of staff members who are on-duty during dismissal.' The superintendent met Monday with the parents of the students involved and have updated their pickup policy. Students must now have a note naming the adult picking them up. The adult must show identification prior to pickup. Ms Stone said this isn't the first time school security concerns have been brought to light. 'We all expressed that dismissal was a disaster waiting to happen,' she said. 'This past Friday, that disaster became my family's reality.'","The man picked up a 5-year-old boy from Sterling Community School and then took him home .

It might seem like blue-sky thinking, but this concept for a highrise farm may just make the utopian vision of sustainable cities a reality. Belgian architect Vincent Callebaut has designed a 132-floor ‘urban farm’ which he claim is the answer to a healthier future for the estimated six billion people who will live in cities by 2050. Imagine, he says, stepping out of your highrise apartment into a sunny, plant-lined corridor, biting into an apple grown in the orchard on the fourth floor. The vertical farm is shaped like the wings of a dragonfly and the design of Belgian architect Vincent Callebaut. He believes it is the answer to a healthier future for the six billion people who will live in cities by 2050 . You take the lift to your office, passing the rice paddy and one of the many gardens housed in the glass edifice that not only heats and cools itself, but also captures rainwater and recirculates domestic waste as plant food. This, claims Mr Callebaut, is the city of the future. He envisions a self-sufficient ‘living organism’ of avant-garde buildings which some critics have dismissed as daft or a blight on the landscape. ‘We need to invent new ways of living in the future,’ the 36-year-old designer told AFP at the Paris studio where he plies his trade. ‘The city of tomorrow will be dense, green and connected. The goal is to bring agriculture and nature back into the urban core so that by 2050...we have green, sustainable cities where humans live in balance with their environment.’ Belgian architect Vincent Callebaut (pictured) claims his ideas were initially met with criticism. 'They made fun of me,' he said. 'They said I created a piece of science fiction' The structure includes areas for meat, dairy and egg production, orchards, meadows and rice fields along with offices and flats, gardens and public recreation spaces . It is estimated that food production will have to increase by 70 percent by 2050 to meet human demand. Agriculture already consumes more than 30 percent of the world's land area -- cropland alone accounts for 10 percent. About 3.5 billion people, half the world population, live in cities today, up from 13 percent a century ago. By 2030, the urban share will swell to 60 per cent, rising further to 70 percent by 2050 when the world's occupants will number over nine billion. The world's cities occupy only two percent of land on Earth, but account for 60-80 per cent of energy consumption and about 75 percent of planet-warming carbon emissions. By 2050, about 15 billion hectares (37 billion acres) or five percent of global land, will be covered by built-up areas. Sources: United Nations, International Energy Agency, Food and Agricultural Organisation . Each building, he said, must ultimately be a ‘self-sufficient, mini-power station.’ The quest for sustainable urban living has never been more urgent as people continue flocking to cities which encroach ever more onto valuable rural land, gobbling up scarce natural resources and making a disproportionate contribution to pollution and Earth-warming carbon emissions. Enter Mr Callebaut with his project ‘Dragonfly’ - a design for a massive, twin-towered, ‘vertical farm’ on New York's Roosevelt Island. From each tower springs a large, glass-and-steel wing, so that the edifice resembles the insect after which it was named. The structure includes areas for meat, dairy and egg production, orchards, meadows and rice fields along with offices and flats, gardens and public recreation spaces. Energy is harvested from the sun and wind, and hot air is trapped between the building ‘wings’ to provide heating in winter. In summer, cooling is achieved through natural ventilation and transpiration from the abundant plant growth. Plants grow on the exterior shell to filter rain water, which is captured and mixed with liquid waste from the towers, treated organically and used as fertiliser. And at the base of the colossus is a floating market on the East River for the inhabitants to sell their organic produce. ‘They made fun of me. They said I created a piece of science fiction,’ Mr Callebaut says of his detractors. But as awareness has grown of the plight of our planet, overpopulation and climate change, his ideas have gained traction, and the Dragonfly design has been exhibited at an international fair in China. At the base is a floating market on the East River for the inhabitants to sell their organic produce . Mr Callebaut has also drafted a concept for a floating city resembling a lily pad that will house refugees forced from their homes by climate change. And he hopes to sell a design for a ‘farmscraper’ in Shenzhen, China that will include housing, offices, leisure space and food gardens. As yet, Mr Callebaut has found no buyers for these big projects. ‘With the recent economic recession, politicians and government may... have been reluctant to venture into such new, large-scale endeavours that have not been tested before,’ Emilia Plotka, a sustainability expert at the Royal Institute of Royal Architects, told AFP of Dragonfly and similar projects. But she pointed out the concept has inspired other, smaller projects. Plants grow on the exterior shell to filter rain water, which is captured and mixed with liquid waste from the towers, treated organically and used as fertiliser . ‘Instead of majestically tall bionic towers plonked in riverbeds, vertical farms have been rather more modestly integrated into existing buildings, derelict industrial sites and floating barges,’ said Ms Plotka. One example is the Pasona Urban Farm -- a nine-storey office building in Tokyo that allows employees to grow their own food in specially reserved green spaces at work. ‘Whilst the buy-in may not be as noticeable at the moment, it certainly is widespread and growing,’ said Ms Plotka of the vertical farm movement. ‘I suspect most other new vertical farms will remain hidden in disused urban spaces or existing business and domestic blocks, which is not bad at all as they will use fewer resources to be set up and enhance their surrounding environments and communities.’ Mr Callebaut with another of his designs, the Agora Tower. Designed to mimic two encircling hands, the towers are organised around a central core that allows for what the design team call a 'hyper-abundance of suspended gardens'","Highrise includes orchards, .

Fourteen million Brits will take to the roads tonight in wet and windy conditions for their annual Christmas getaway. Commuters were beset by delays as they headed out of London via the M25, and those headed north via the A1 were stopped in their tracks after a lorry caught fire outside Leeds. The disruptions come as strong winds and rain are predicted over the coming days for those headed home for the festive season. Although those using the transport network this evening were not severely disrupted by the weather, large amounts of rain and gale-force winds could hit those travelling in the coming days. Traffic leaves London on the westbound M4 on the last Friday before Christmas . Traffic on the M27 motorway near Southampton as the expected Christmas rush starts, on what is expected to be one of the busiest days of the year for travelling . Travellers wait for their trains as the expected Christmas rush starts, at King's Cross Train station in central London, on what is expected to be one of the busiest days of the year for the rail network . Forecaster at the Met Office and . motoring experts at the RAC have warned anybody using the roads for . their Christmas getaways to be careful. The worst delays of the evening are thanks to a lorry full of toilet roll caught fire as it drove northbound along the A1. Police and fire services headed to the incident, which took place near Boston Spa in West Yorkshire, north of Leeds. Debris was spilled over the carriageways as two hose reels battled to put the vehicle out. The road was closed, and the Highway Agency estimated it will not open again until midnight, causing severe delays. Earlier the agency warned of 'moderate' delays . of around 40 minutes on the clockwise M25 between junctions J29 and J1A, . which were not expected to clear until 7.30pm, while other areas of the . clockwise carriageway are also set for minor delays. Elsewhere travellers are expected to crowd . on to trains, boats and planes over Christmas making the next few days . the busiest days of the year for the Britain's transport system. However, those hoping for an easy ride could find the journey hampered by a stormy few days. Parts of western Scotland could see up to . 20in of rain, and 10 to 15in the south-west of England as the unsettled . outlook continues. The rest of the UK will also see much . the same which has led to a series of weather warnings being put in . place for later with gale force winds and more heavy rain forecast. Met Office forecaster Dan Williams warned that anyone using the roads for their Christmas getaways should be careful. He . said: 'Driving conditions won't be good, there will be strong winds . across the country today and rain. We would advise people to allow extra time for . their journeys and drive to the conditions.' He . added that over the next few days there will be a 'mix of weather . conditions' until Christmas Eve with the west of Scotland and Wales . baring the brunt of the wind and the rain, but all areas seeing patches . of sunshine and temperature above average for the month until late on Tuesday. By Christmas Day, a band of rain will move in and the temperature drop could mean snow in some areas. Mr . Williams said: 'There is a chance of seeing some sleet or snow on . Christmas Day, but it won't be heavy or widespread. There's just the . potential and you can't pinpoint where it will be.'

A sizeable chunk of the four million heading abroad for the holiday period are flying from UK airports, with the Canary Islands one of the top destinations. On the roads, the Highways Agency has either completed or suspended roadworks at a number of sites on England's motorways and major A-roads. Some works on busy routes, such as sections of the M25 and the M1, are still in place, and motoring organisations say today is likely to be extremely busy. A RAC spokesman said: 'While it is normally cold that make driving dangerous here we have rain and wind and it will certainly make things difficult. We are expecting around 14 million cars on the road today, up from 11 million on any given day. 'We are advising people to be careful, to drive at the right speed and leave enough time for their journeys.' Many travellers are heading home for the holiday break by rail. Those using trains over the festive period will have to contend with a number of engineering projects. A donkey peers over a fence in the Derbyshire Peak District at Magpie Mine near Monyash .

Among the routes affected are the Gatwick Express line from Victoria station in London to Gatwick Airport in West Sussex. A major project means that there will be no Gatwick Express services from Christmas Day to the end of New Year's Day. Travel organisation Abta said today, tomorrow and Sunday are likely to be the busiest days for those flying abroad. The most-popular destinations for sun lovers were the Canary Islands, Tunisia, Morocco and the Cape Verde Islands off western Africa. For those flying long-haul, Dubai, Mexico, Cuba and Kenya are favourite spots, while for skiers Switzerland, France, Austria and Italy are the top spots.Popular for New Year's Eve breaks are Paris, Edinburgh, Amsterdam, Rome and Dublin, Abta said. For those holidaying in the UK, London and York are popular along with the seaside resorts of Llandudno in North Wales, Torquay and Eastbourne.Abta said around 360,000 travellers would be flying from Stansted over the Christmas period, with around the same number leaving from Manchester, 175,000 from Luton and 100,000 from Glasgow and Edinburgh airports.

British Airways said just under two million people will fly with the airline between December 16 and January 5, with today being the busiest day with more than 115,000 travellers flying. Channel Tunnel high-speed rail company Eurostar said it will be carrying more than 420,000 people from December 20 to January 3 - an 11% rise on the same period 12 months ago.

VisitEngland said around 20 per cent of the adult population planned to spend at least one night away from home over the festive period, with these trips boosting the UK economy by around Â£1.9 billion. A spokesman for rail industry organisation the Rail Delivery Group said: 'As fewer passengers travel over the festive period, we can continue one of the biggest programme of improvements in the railway's history while ensuring the vast majority experience no disruption whatsoever.' A series of accidents on major road routes hampered the getaway this morning. One of the worst-hit areas was the M5 at Bristol, where an overturned van led to long tailbacks. Other roads where there were hold-ups included the M1 in West Yorkshire and in Leicestershire, the M4 in Berkshire, Wiltshire and south Wales, the M8 in Glasgow, the M25 in Essex, and the A56 at Accrington in Lancashire. Air traffic control company Nats said around 5,800 flights would be handled today - the busiest day of the festive period - and an increase on the 5,664 aircraft movements on the last Friday before Christmas last year, which was also the busiest day. Nats, which endured a major technical problem at its Hampshire headquarters causing flight disruption on Saturday December 7, said Saturdays in December had been particularly busy, with many jetting off for skiing holidays. The company said that air traffic was likely to be reduced between Christmas Eve and New Year's Day with Nats predicting around 1,400 flights on Christmas Day and around 3,900 on both Christmas Eve and Boxing Day.","Rush-hour traffic hits the Westbound M4 leaving London, the M25 and the A4 .

Police have described 26-year-old Tashawna Caldwell as being 'hysterical' when they arrived at the scene on Sunday night. Caldwell has now been charged in the death of Caiden Parker who was about to turn two on Wednesday. She is now in jail on a charge of capital murder of a child with her bond set at $1 million. The second woman was unhurt but the child had 'minor scratches' on his body after being injured in the attack. In jail: Tashawna M Caldwell, a woman who has been charged with capital murder in the stabbing death of her 2-year-old son. She's in custody in the Atascoca County Jail in Jourdanton . Confession: On Sunday, Tashawna Caldwell allegedly admitted to killing her boy, who would have celebrated his second birthday on Wednesday . Investigators are trying to determine what prompted the attack early Sunday at a home near Poteet which is 25 miles south of San Antonio. Deputies responded to a disturbance call. Sheriff  David Soward says the boy, Caiden Parker, was dead at the scene. A second woman with an older child was found in another room of the residence where the pair took cover for protection, Sheriff David Soward said. Untimely death: When police found Caldwell she was hysterical. Her son, Calden Parker, was discovered with multiple stab wounds. He died at the scene . Before his time: Little Calden Parker, 1, was to celebrate his birthday tomorrow. Police do not understand what drove the mother to stab the little boy who died on Sunday night . Where it happened: Deputies got a call for a family disturbance at 12:50 a.m. Sunday morning from the 500 block of Highland Loop Drive in Poteet near San Antonio . Soward wouldn't say what their relationship to Caldwell is, but he did confirm that the other child had minor scratches from the incident. Authorities said Caldwell made two admissions about the stabbing, both to officers who first arrived at the scene and later in an official statement. Soward would not comment on a motive for the stabbing Sunday, saying it was under investigation. Soward said the scene was one of the more difficult his investigators had encountered. 'It's very tragic. It's hard on everyone involved — even the most seasoned officers,' he said. 'It's something you don't ever forget because it's so senseless. There's not a more innocent victim than a child, and for his life to be snuffed out because of actions of his mother is just unbelievable.'","Tashawna Caldwell charged with capital murder in stabbing death of Caiden Parker .

Juan Mata has told Chelsea fans he had planned to stay at the club for the rest of his career in an emotional letter, admitting frustration at a 'complicated' six months was the main reason behind leaving the club. The Spaniard completed a £37.1million deal to join Premier League rivals Manchester United on Saturday. But he couldn't move to Old Trafford without saying goodbye to Blues fans - revealing that he had to open a new chapter for the good of his career. Mata claimed feeling like a peripheral figure under Jose Mourinho was the reason he opted for a move away.

Cheelky: The midfielder gave a nod and a wink to supporters who gathered to catch a glimpse . The 25-year-old was an integral part of Roberto Di Matteo's Champions League-winning team in 2012 but just two starts in the last eight games made up his mind - bringing an end to a turbulent time under Mourinho. Mata has won the club's player of the year award in each of the last two seasons but Mourinho sees Eden Hazard, Willian and Oscar as more suited to the way in which his teams play. The playmaker is to be officially unveiled as a United player on Monday afternoon and is expected to go straight into the squad to play Cardiff City on Tuesday. Even though departing - and having only been a Chelsea player for three years - Mata showed his classy nature in the letter, posted to his official website. '(Thanks) To Robbie and Rafa, for their unlimited . trust in me. And to Jose, for making me a stronger player, because in . difficult moments, I have learnt to remain positive and to keep working . hard. 'Lastly, I want to thank the Club, and in particular its owner, . Roman Abramovich, for trusting me and making an important investment . when signing me.

Hi everyone, As you can imagine this is a very important day in my life, and with these lines I would like to express the memories and emotions that come to me as I write. This letter is written from my heart, and first of all I would like to say that I will never forget all the affection given to me by the Chelsea fans. From the very first day until the last. With your support and affection I have grown up as a player and I have had an amazing time both on and off the pitch. I will always feel the gratitude towards you. Always. No words are enough to give back all the things I have received. There has been plenty of good moments: the FA Cup, my first trophy as a Blue; the immense happiness of winning titles for the first time in the club's history, such as that magical Champions League night in Munich and the Europa League... On the other hand, I have experienced some complicated situations from a personal point of view, mainly during the last six months. Every message I got through the social media, every nice word you have said to me on the street, and of course, your support in the stadium, has made me feel incredibly proud of the Chelsea fans; you deserve a team like the one you've got, with so many fantastic players. I won't forget the faith you put in me when I was given the player of the year award the last two seasons. I feel really proud and I will never forget those nights. Thank you so much for the way you have treated me, you have been unbelievable. I hope you understand that after going through a complicated and, for me, new situation in the last few months, I believe this is the best choice in order to carry on with my football career and to keep enjoying this sport. Before last summer, my intention was to stay here for a long time; as long as the club wanted me to, and to keep winning trophies for Chelsea FC. This is how happy I was in the club and in the city. However, as you all know, things changed after the preseason. From feeling like an important player, I started to experience some difficult situations and I felt unable to help the team to the extent that I wanted and was used to. Obviously, I fully respect the circumstances. Football is a team sport and it's not easy to play regularly in such a good squad. In sports you may win or lose, but the most important thing is to give everything. I hope you know and feel that I have always done so. In every game, in every training session, without exception. I have always tried my best for the club. I would like to emphasise the affection, admiration and respect that I've had for my former team mates since the first day. I want to thank the captains for their help and understanding at all times. They made me feel comfortable when I arrived and they have supported me throughout the difficult times this season. I thank all my former team mates for these two and a half years and I wish them the best, personally and professionally, for the future. Of course I have been closer to some of them, but the most important thing is that my years in Chelsea have left me with great friends. Friends forever, football rivalries aside. I also want to highlight the day-to-day job of every member of the Chelsea staff: medical team, kit men, staff at Cobham and Stamford Bridge, media and marketing department, Chelsea TV team... All of them are very important in making this club a great one. Thank you for your treatment and your efforts to make the life of the players easier. Furthermore, thanks to every manager I have had the pleasure to work with during my time here. They have all been a big help for my progression as a player. I have always respected their decisions, whatever they were; they made me more mature and a stronger person. You learn from everything, and certain situations make you think about other team mates who are coping with similar situations more regularly. Thank you Andre for giving me the opportunity to join Chelsea FC. Without your support, none of this would have happened. To Robbie and Rafa, for their unlimited trust in me. And to Jose, for making me a stronger player, because in difficult moments, I have learnt to remain positive and to keep working hard. Lastly, I want to thank the Club, and in particular its owner, Roman Abramovich, for trusting me and making an important investment when signing me. Also for their understanding regarding my situation over the last months. I'm very glad to have been part of the squad that made his and our dream come true: winning the Champions League on that unforgettable night in Munich. Additionally, my years in Chelsea have been profitable for the club, which I'm very pleased about. I want to make clear that the stage that now comes to an end has been extremely important for me, personally and professionally. Although many of you, like myself, never thought this moment would come, this is football and a new chapter is about to begin. I would have liked to say good bye to all of you in the stadium, or in a press conference, but it has not been possible. I'm sure, i will be able to do it in the future, because is what you deserve. Evidently, today is a day of mixed feelings, remembering the past and looking forward to the future and what it has to bring. I look forward to being happy and to enjoy what I like the most: play football. I will never forget my time in Chelsea and the affection I take with me, I will keep forever. I wish you the best.

Shattered: Kia Graves is a former actress who once had a successful career with a modeling agency but since she was raped in 2012, she hasn't worked and her socially life has been shattered . A woman who was attacked and raped in her Manhattan apartment in 2012 has come forward to detail the horrific night a teenage pizza boy allegedly assaulted her as her 7-year-old daughter slept in the bed beside her. Kia Graves, 37, reveals that her life has been utterly turned upside down since the night Cesar Lucas, 17, is charged with slipping into her apartment and having his way with her while out on a run for his father's 10th Avenue pizza restaurant. 'I have nightmares thinking that he’s getting out of jail, and I wake up all the time making sure my door is locked,' said the shell-shocked mom. Unfortunately, her door was not locked that September night. Cesar Lucas was working as a delivery . boy at Sal’s Pizza in the same Manhattan . neighborhood as the woman’s luxury apartment building. He was delivering a pizza to the next-door flat when he noticed that the door was slightly ajar and allegedly entered the apartment. Graves, a former actress turned model agency employee, had gone to bed with her daughter an hour and a half before the alleged incident. It was the last time Grave says she's had a normal night's sleep. 'I sleep with one eye open, basically,' she told the New York Daily News. 'I have panic attacks and I wake up in sweats.' Graves no longer works and lives each day crippled by her memories of the attack. 'I don’t know what to do,' she said. 'I’m just seeing my doctor and hoping for the best.' In addition to her professional life, Graves said her social life has been left in shambles. 'I . used to go out sometimes after work,' she told the Daily News. 'We used . to have parties or go out. I used to date. I wasn’t a social butterfly, . but I had a normal social life, definitely.' Charged: Pizza delivery boy Cesar Lucas, who was 16 at the time, has pleaded not guilty to rape in court but confessed to 'sexual intercorse' with the 35-year-old in a handwritten note released by police . Graves still lives in the apartment where she was raped--a building in which she grew up and where her mother also lives to this day--and her deepest fear is that her attacker, who knows where she lives, will somehow come to find her. 'I’m scared that my rapist will get out of jail and he knows where I live,' she said. 'There’s constant fear and anxiety.' And as much as she fears it, she may have to face her attacker in court. Lucas . returns to court Tuesday, his 18th birthday, and is charges with rape, . sex abuse, burglary and of endangering the welfare of Graves' then . 7-year-old child. Lucas . pleaded not guilty to rape and burglary even as police released a . handwritten letter, signed by the teen on the night of the alleged rape. Meanwhile, Graves is suing the night doorman who was there the evening of the attack and was subsequently fired. She's also suing Sal's Pizza, her condo building and management company. The accused described ‘a type of disea’ which made him enter the victim’s flat after midnight on September 29, 2012. He sexually assaulted the woman, who was sleeping in her bed with her daughter, police said. Disturbing: The then 16-year-old was on a delivery for his father's restaurant Sal's Pizza on Manhattan's West Side. He'd been charged with breaking into apartments before . On the stand: Cesar was delivering pizza to a neighbour Graves' luxury condo complex in Manhattan when he attacked her as she slept next to her seven-year-old daughter . ‘I screamed,’ the Graves told the Daily News at the time. ‘It took him about 30 seconds. I said, “Get off of me,” and I pushed him. He said “I’m sorry,” and ran out,’ she said. Lucas . was picked up by police at Sal's Pizza a short time later and charged . with rape and burglary. He allegedly told police he was 'feeling horny'. ‘Cesar . got type of disea in a way he never had felted before,’ the poorly . written note reads. ‘I unrap her from all the coushing she had on top of . her. She also started to feel horny, you can say,’ Continuing . to refer to himself in the third person, Lucas Cesar then describes the . sexual assault, claiming he had sexual intercourse with her for two . minutes before leaving the apartment – but not before rummaging through . her daughter’s purse and stealing $20, according to the New York Post. The 16-year-old also claims the woman was ‘completely drunk’ ‘I really was pretty scare because she was drunk and I kind ah took advantage of her.’ Appearing . at Manhattan Supreme Court today, Lucas Cesar kept his head down and . stared at the table in front of him until he was asked to plea. He briefly lifted his head to speak the words ‘Not guilty’. Upon his arrest, Cesar Lucas initially denied raping the woman, but admitted he had broken into the flat . ‘What's going on? Why are you arresting me? I've been arrested before for the same thing. I broke into an apartment. It's still pending. I have to go to court,’ he said according to police statements released to the New York Post. Lucas was referring to his arrest in August for breaking into a 39-year-old woman's apartment while making a delivery and stealing her wallet. He was charged with burglary, criminal possession of stolen credit cards and theft of service, to which he has pleaded not guilty . Lucas was taken into custody on September 29 where he eventually made the horrific and grammatically appalling confession to rape. He put all the blame on his ‘disea’, adding in the note that ‘Cesar didn't realized what kind of things he was about to do or make.’","Cesar Lucas, now 17, is accused of sexually assaulting 35-year-old former actress Kia Graves as she slept in her Manhattan apartment in 2012 .

The Texas college student killed during a traffic stop last Friday, was charging at the campus officer when he was shot at six times, police say. In a press conference Monday afternoon, Chief Richard Pruitt of the Alamo Heights Police Department said 23-year-old student Robert Cameron Redus had wrestled Cpt Chris Carter's baton away from him and hit the policeman in the head and arm with it. Cpt Carter eventually got the baton back and told Redus four times to stop fighting him or he would shoot. That's when Redus turned around and charged at Carter with his arm raised to strike, and Cpt Carter took out his .40-calibur semiautomatic gun and shot six times at Redus, hitting him five times in the chest, neck, eye, arm and thigh. While the camera on the police cruiser . was out, audio was still working which captured Carter warning Redus 56 . times to stop resisting arrest, 14 times to place his hands behind his back and three times that he was under arrest. The incident is still under investigation. Investigation: Police say Cameron Redus, 23, was charging at a campus police officer when he was shot . Under investigation: The parking lot of Redus' apartment block where he died is cordoned off by police . Scuffle: Witnesses heard a short exchange between Cameron and the officer before shots were fired . Cpt Carter pulled the student over not far from campus in Alamo Heights because he was speeding and 'driving erratically,' according to police. Alamo Heights Police Lieutenant Cindy Pruitt told KSAT . that the incident occurred about 2am in the parking lot of the Treehouse apartments in the 100 block of Grandview Place off Broadway, where . Redus was a resident. Redus, known to friends by his second name Cameron, had spent the evening celebrating the end of semester with classmates. It . is not clear where Carter first tried to pull Redus over, but both . vehicles drove north on Broadway until they pulled into the parking lot . of the Treehouse Apartments where the struggle ensued. Pruitt told My San Antonio that Carter radioed for help shortly before Redus was shot. Cameron had been celebrating the end of semester with friends before he was shot . A witness who lives in the Treehouse Apartments described hearing 'five or six' gunshots, but no verbal warnings. 'I . didn't hear him say anything like, ""Get down on your hands and knees,"" you know? I didn't hear him say anything. He just started shooting,' the . man told KSAT. 'He emptied the gun on him,' he said. 'Boom, boom, boom.' Mohammad Haidarasl lives directly below Redus at the Treehouse Apartments. He told My San Antonio that he was asleep on his sofa when he heard an exchange between Redus and Carter. 'I heard [a man] say, ""Oh, you're gonna shoot me?"" like sarcastic almost,' he said. Less . than a minute later, Mr Haidarasl heard four to six gunshots. He only . realized the man who had been shot was his upstairs neighbor, whom . Haidrasl described as 'the nicest guy.' Officers investigating the incident haven't attempted to contact Haidrasl about what he heard, Haidrasl told My San Antonio. Not aggressive: Cameron Redus' friends and family can't understand how someone as gentle and kind as him could have been shot by a police officer . The officer, who has been placed on leave pending the outcome of the shooting investigation, has an 'extensive law enforcement background' according to the university. However, part of the background involves jumping from job-to-job on a regular basis, according to employment records obtained by the San Antonio Express-News. Cpt Carter has had nine jobs at eight different agencies over his eight-year law enforcement career. He rarely stayed in any job for more than a year and the two years and seven months as a campus officer for UIW was the longest stint in his career. KVUE-TV reports that Cpt Carter has told investigators he feared for his life. Grief: Valerie Redus is hugged by family friend Emily Vaughan at a vigil for her son Cameron . Devastated: One of Cameron's brothers, and his father Mickey, at the vigil . But the story of Redus as the aggressor doesn't ring true to the people who knew the Incarnate Word senior. 'He was just not that type of person,' his peer, 20-year-old Miriam Thomas, told My San Antonio. 'Everyone has been completely heartbroken over this.' More than 200 people - including Redus' mother and father - turned out a vigil Sunday to mourn the UIW student . and remember his short life. 'We are understandably devastated by . the death of our dear son Cameron and we ask for your prayers as we deal . with our tragic loss,' his family said in a statement. 'We trust that God is faithful and will see us through this most difficult time.' Several of Redus' friends spoke to the media. Memories: The ceremony included many remembrances from friends in the UIW community. A candlelight vigil was also held on campus at the Lourdes Grotto. Redus' brother and mother can be seen on the right of the picture . A vigil was held inside the Academic Convocation Center. Many in attendance either wore green clothing or a green ribbon as it was his favorite color. Redus' brother is seen here . Kyle Leihsing, a San Antonio native had been friends with Redus for three years. 'He was one of the most level-headed people I've ever met. What I have heard is completely counter-intuitive to what I have known him to be,' he said. 'There's just an outpouring of genuine grief among hundreds, if not thousands, of people in our community because he was so well-liked and loved,' Annie Jones, a friend of Redus, told KENS 5. 'Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of the student and officer involved in this incident,' UIW President Dr Lou Agnese said. Redus had moved to San Antonio from Baytown for school. He went to Baytown Christian Academy and graduated as co-valedictorian. His academic success continued at . UIW, where he had been named to the Dean's List and was a part-time . anchor for the school's student newscast. 'I . grieve on behalf of his parents, because I know how devastated they . are. He was a sweet, sweet person,' said family friend Annie Jones. Doubts: Mickey Redus, pictured at his son's vigil, says he has doubts about the police account of the shooting . Come together: Close friends of Cameron Redus come to a vigill. Many in attendance either wore green clothing or a green ribbon as it was his favorite color . Big turnout:  Family and friends of University of the Incarnate Word student Robert Cameron Redus gather for a candlelight vigil and tribute .

Back in Redus' hometown of Baytown, the promising student's mother, father, brothers and friends are struggling to understand their loss. Redus old friends from high school were shocked to hear the news. 'He was so kind. He’s not an aggressive person at all,' friend Sara Davis told KHOU. 'The story doesn’t really make sense to any of us.' A vigil has been set for 7pm on Saturday at the University of the Incarnate Word grotto.

A peer jailed for fiddling his expenses has been caught ‘clocking in’ to the House of Lords for barely half an hour a day to claim his £300 daily attendance fee. But yesterday Lord Hanningfield defended himself saying that ‘at least half’ of all peers were also abusing the allowance system – before going even further and claiming: ‘They all do it.’ During July, Lord Hanningfield was monitored clocking in for as little as 21 minutes a day to register for his fee. On 11 out of 19 days, for which he claimed £5,700, he spent fewer than 40 minutes in Parliament. The left-hand picture shows Lord Hanningfield arriving at Westminster station at 14.36, ahead of walking to the Palace of Westminster. The right-hand picture shows him getting back on the tube less than half an hour later . And last night, Lord Hanningfield – who was expelled from the Tory Party after being jailed in 2011 over the expenses scandal – faced the prospect of a police investigation after Labour MP John Mann made a formal complaint to Scotland Yard. Mr Mann said: ‘No reasonable person could describe what he is doing as parliamentary work. ‘There are clearly issues here that need investigation by the police. ‘It is potentially not just immoral behaviour. I’m sure the police will want to investigate him.’ But Lord Hanningfield yesterday defended his right to claim his fee for such short spells in Parliament, and tried to draw other members of the House of Lords into the scandal. He said: ‘I could say the whole 600 sometimes just go in to clock in. A lot of the MPs, because they get salaries, don’t go in at all. At least we have to go in. ‘Being a Lord is not just going in to . the House of Lords. It’s the post you have. I have 15 letters a day. I . have all sorts of things like that. I can do some of it at home, I can . do some of it at my office in the Lords.’ Lord . Hanningfield was caught by undercover reporters from the Daily Mirror, . who monitored his parliamentary activity during July. 'The whole 600 sometimes just go in to clock in': Lord Hanningfield tried to defend his behaviour by saying it was commonplace among his colleagues . But speaking outside his £700,000 home in Essex yesterday, he said: ‘I’ve done nothing wrong, I’ve been doing my work. I double-check with the finance department all the time. I don’t have this money myself, I give it to other people. I’ve never made a penny out of my public work.’ Yesterday the Prime Minister’s official spokesman said David Cameron had been ‘dismayed’ by the revelation about Lord Hanningfield, and leader of the Lords, Lord Hill, said that peers found to be exploiting the daily allowance system would be banned from Parliament. Despite being jailed for nine months over the expenses scandal, Lord Hanningfield was allowed back in the House of Lords and has claimed nearly £51,300 in allowances between April 2012 and July 2013. During that time he did not make any speeches in the Lords chamber. Since October, Lord Hanningfield has spoken twice and submitted four written questions. He told the BBC: ‘Doing work in the Lords is not just working in the chamber, unless you are going to speak. During July I was preparing myself for what I’m doing now, and during this term I’ve been speaking and asking questions. I’m really back to an active life in politics and I don’t appreciate the Mirror following me around in July.’ The former Essex County Council leader claimed he spent half of the £300 daily fee on expenses and so did not really make any profit. He was a full-time peer who needed the money to pay his electricity bills and buy food, he said. He added: ‘You have to go in to get the allowances but you do most of your work not in the Chamber.’ He also claimed he was writing his . memoirs to set the record straight about how he was ‘wrongly charged and . wrongly convicted’ of expenses fraud. Yesterday, . Lord Hill told the Lords that party leaders were ‘dismayed about the . shadow it casts over the whole House’. He told peers that there would be . a new sanction to withdraw financial support and access to facilities . for Lords who breach a code of conduct which is expected to be . introduced in the new year. Lord Hill also called for the code of conduct to be tightened up to take action against those who ‘bring the House into disrepute’. A backbench bill brought forward by Tory MP Dan Byles would also allow the permanent expulsion of members of the Lords who commit serious criminal offences. Lord Oakeshott criticised the system that allowed convicted peers to continue sitting in the Lords. ‘You can stroll out of the prison gates in the morning and into the Lords after lunch and claim your allowances,’ he told Sky News. ‘That is, I think, completely unacceptable that we have a system of convicted criminals sitting in the Lords and voting on our laws. We need the whole place to be cleaned up, we need it elected, we need half the number of people, the whole thing is a mess.’ The Electoral Reform Society, which has campaigned for an elected House of Lords, said: ‘When people look at the House of Lords, they see an outdated institution which bears no relation to their own experiences. It’s no wonder people feel alienated from politics when they see peers clocking on for £300 a day and clocking off shortly after. After all, who’d be able to get away with that in normal life?’ There are currently 779 ‘eligible’ members of the House of Lords. More than 40 other peers have taken a ‘leave of absence’ for health or professional reasons, meaning they cannot attend. A retirement scheme was introduced in 2011 to encourage peers no longer attending to step down voluntarily, but so far only three peers have used it.","Lord Hanningfield claims 'at least half' of peers also do the same thing .

An 84-year-old man who blacked out while being bruised and bloodied by New York's Finest after jaywalking is hitting back with a lawsuit seeking millions. Kang Wong says he has never broken a single law while living in the same Upper West Side apartment for almost 50 years, and he's suing for $5million after being 'humiliated' and roughed up and arrested for a minor infraction earlier this month. The lawsuit first reported by the New York Daily News names the city, the police department and individual officers involved in a January 19 altercation with police who threw Mr Kang to the ground and arrested him for crossing the street. Kang Wong, who lives near the Upper West Side, was stopped earlier this month by an officer for allegedly crossing the street against the light . 'I didn’t commit any crime,' Mr Wong said during an interview with the paper translated by a family lawyer. 'It was excessive how they (the police) did it to me. If I did something wrong, I could understand, but I didn’t. 'They make me feel shame,' he added. 'I was very humiliated.' Cops recently stepped up their presence at the corner of West 96th Street and Broadway after a series of traffic incidents involving pedestrians. Mr Kang told the Daily News he became an unwitting victim to their overzealous policing. The former owner of La Nueva Victoria, a popular neighborhood restaurant, says he had a green light when he crossed the street but can't recall if it had changed by the time he made it across. When he reached the other side he was met by a police officer asking for identification, he said. The retiree admitted that he does not speak much English, but that he did understand the request. The cop took his ID and walked away, confusing the grandfather and causing him to ask for it back - in Cantonese. According to one witness, several officers quickly converged on the man, who didn't seem to understand English-language commands, after he simply tried to walk away . 'I was very puzzled and I was very scared,' said Mr Kang. 'I had no idea why I had been stopped. I used Cantonese and said give me back my ID.' The officer responded by quickly pulling out his handcuffs and calling into his radio, according to Mr Kang and eyewitness accounts. Several more officers raced over and threw him against the side of a building. 'I got more scared,' he recalled. Police then threw him to the ground and slapped cuffs on him. Mr Kang says he blacked out during the rough treatment and woke up with his hands cuffed behind his back and blood streaming down his face, pictures taken at the scene confirm at least that much. According to one witness, several officers quickly converged on the man, who didn’t seem to understand English-language commands, after he simply tried to walk away. Cop haunt: Mr Kang owned this restaurant until retiring, he said police frequently ate there . On the scene: Police Commissioner William Bratton (center) initially praised officers for their actions but has sine said he is awaiting the results of an Internal Affairs investigation . ‘The guy didn’t seem to speak English,’ Ian King, a 24-year-old Fordham law student, told the New York Post. ‘He . [the officer] stood him up against the wall and was trying to write him . a ticket. The man didn’t seem to understand, and he started walking . away.’ That’s when the officer and several colleagues quickly converged on the senior citizen and left him badly beaten and bloodied. ‘The cop tried to pull him back and that’s when he [the pedestrian] began to struggle with the cop,’ said Mr King. ‘As soon as he pushed the cop, it was like cops started running in from everywhere.’ Police Commissioner William Bratton initially praised the arrest, tweeting the commander did an 'excellent job' and saying at a news conference 'I’m not aware of excessive force in that at all.' He has since deleted the tweet and the NYPD's Internal Affairs division is looking into the arrest. Law enforcement in the area had earlier promised to step-up enforcement of the law after three pedestrians were struck and killed . within a two-block radius in the neighborhood in nine days, but Mr Kang's lawyer says increased vigilance shouldn't result in decreased dignity. 'We can have police efforts focused on pedestrian safety without violating the civil rights of our citizens,' attorney Sanford Rubenstein told the paper. The former restauranteur says he immigrated from China to Cuba at age 19, and then later to New York where he eventually opened a restaurant after working his way up from washing dishes. 'I always respected the police,' he said. 'The officer and detectives from the precinct used to come into my restaurant all the time.' He also claims he was denied food and water while being held in the precinct, and that 'the fingerprinting hurt.' A police officer and several colleagues quickly converged on the senior citizen and left him badly beaten and bloodied . The latest crash occurred when a 26-year-old woman, Samantha Lee, was crossing 96th street when she was clipped by the driver’s side mirror of an ambulance. She was run over by a red, four-door Dodge Charger after ending  up face-down in the road and was pronounced dead at the scene. Both drivers stayed at the scene and no arrests were immediately made. A week ago on Friday, a nine-year-old boy, Cooper Stock, was struck and killed by a taxi while crossing with his father, while the same night a tour bus dragged 73-year-old Alexander Shear to his death. ‘This intersection is getting worse and worse,’ one elderly neighbor told the Post.","Kang Wong, 84, and his attorney are suing the city, police department and specific officers for civil rights violations .

'My life is destroyed': Fourteen-year-old Hanifa Amar is being forced to marry a 44-year-old landlord in exchange for her family's safe refuge in Lebanon after fleeing the civil war in Syria . A 14-year-old girl who escaped the bloody fighting in Syria is being forced to marry a 44-year-old stranger in exchange for her family's safe refuge across the border. Hanifa Amar's parents say they can no longer afford the $250 (Â£150) monthly rent at a house they fled to in neighbouring Lebanon. The landlord has agreed to let them stay, but only if Hanifa becomes his second wife. Wiping away tears, Hanifa told Al Jazeera: 'My whole life is destroyed. I don't want to marry him, but if I do my family can stay in this house.' The teenager had hoped to marry her 22-year-old cousin, but he died fighting in Syria last year. Instead, she now has to take desperate measures to help her family survive after they were threatened with eviction. Her mother, Mysa, says they cannot risk moving into a tent because her husband suffers from heart problems and she fears her asthmatic son could die in the bitter cold. Her other son, who is 12, earns the little money they have by helping a mechanic, but this is barely enough to pay for food. Mrs Amar said: 'No mother wants to hurt her child, but we have no choice.' Their plight emerged as the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) told yesterday how fear, confusion and a lack of information are preventing many Syrian refugees in Lebanon from knowing where to turn for aid. With a constant surge of refugees now fighting the bitter winter cold, humanitarian organisations are struggling to find ways to reach them with the information they need to survive - and are recruiting some refugees to help out.

Dreams shattered: Hanifa had hoped to marry her 22-year-old cousin (right), but he died fighting in Syria . Of all of Syria's neighbours, Lebanon has been the hardest hit by the exodus of Syrians fleeing their country's violence. Close to 1.5 million Syrians are now in Lebanon, scattered across the volatile country often in makeshift substandard accommodation. Unlike in neighboring Turkey and Jordan, there are no official refugee camps. From immunisation and other health services, to education and even basic aid to survive outside their war-stricken homeland, most Syrians in Lebanon feel lost in a world of rumors and misinformation. The conflict in Syria has left more than 100,000 people dead and displaced as many as two million.","Hanifa Amar's family escaped bloody fighting to neighbouring Lebanon .

With her honey-streaked blonde locks, unlined skin and sweet smile, Sheri Winkelmann, an actress and playwright, looks years younger than her real age of 51. But it's possible that her preternaturally youthful looks are the result not of good skincare but the famous maxim: 'you're only as old as the man you feel'. And for Sheri, that means very young indeed. Her boyfriend of just over a year, up-and-coming actor Desmond Huey, is just 26 years old. Scroll down for video . Happy couple: 'Cougar' Sheri Winkelmann, 51, with Desmond Huey, 26, her boyfriend of just over a year . Now the couple are to appear on TLC documentary, Extreme Cougar Wives, which explores what life is like when your other half is young enough to be your son. And for Sheri, life with Desmond is so good, she wouldn't change a single thing. 'It's been about 15 months and it's going good,' she says of her relationship. 'He's a very unusual young man and he's very mature for his age. I feel I have a trusted equal partner and he's never ever done anything to drive me up the wall!' Wonderful though her other half is, she admits there have been moments where others haven't been quite so understanding. 'I do wonder whether people are reacting to the age difference or the fact that we're black and white,' she muses. Perfect match: Sheri says shared values and Desmond's maturity are the secret of their relationship . Open-minded: Sheri says women should be more accepting of love that comes in an unconventional package . 'But there has been no real opposition. Perhaps it would be an issue if we were living in an all-white town in the countryside but here in Chicago, people are more open minded.' The couple, who first met more than two years ago at a conference in Palm Springs, were friends for 12 months before Desmond finally made his move. 'I think it [the relationship] works because of our shared value system,' she explains. 'Obviously having children is a big issue but he's not ready so not an issue yet. 'What's different is that we really love each other in the purest sense, so we will do what's best for each other even if that means not being together.' Despite acknowledging the potential pitfalls, Sheri thinks its time women stopped fixating on age and opened themselves up to relationships with men they might not have considered. Confidence: According to Sheri, in order to catch your own dream man, feeling happy with yourself is key . 'I never like to be limited by a label,' she explains. 'Cougar doesn't necessarily have the most positive connotations but people should open up to love, . and if comes in form of someone younger, then don't dismiss it. 'Before meeting Desmond, I had . rejected the idea of dating someone younger but he just wore me down. 'I would tell other women to . trust their insticts and go with the flow - love comes in all kinds of odd packages.' Sheri and Desmond appear in Extreme Cougar Wives on TLC, Tuesdays at 10pm . 'These are the only things that work,' explains Sheri. 'I got my heart smashed lots of times in the past but I learned!' LOVE YOURSELF . 'It's kind of like when you go to bank and they turn you down for loans. When you have money, you get the loan, and when you don't, you don't. Love yourself and other people will too.' BE YOURSELF . 'Be proud of who you are and don't be afraid to own your age, weight, experience in life... I feel much more secure now. I was such an insecure mess when younger and it's not attractive. RELAX . 'Let the guy show you who he is. Sometimes women so want to be partnered, that it all becomes too much so give him time to come to you and show you who he really is.' DON'T LOSE SIGHT OF YOUR OWN VALUE . 'Don't give away more than willing to lose. Remember that you are valuable and let him work to please you.

Aaron Hernandez is being sued for $12million by the families of two men he's suspected of murdering in 2012, it emerged today. The families of Daniel Abreu and Safiro Furtado, who were found shot to death in Boston two years ago filed the wrongful death lawsuits Wednesday in Suffolk Superior Court. Each seeks $6 million from the former New England Patriots player. The men were sitting in an SUV in the city's South End in July 2012 when another SUV pulled up and someone inside opened fire. Scroll Down for Video . Wrongful death: Aaron Hernandez, pictured in September, 2013, has been hit with wrongful death lawsuits for two shooting 2012 deaths just days after he was after he was accused of brutally beating an inmate in prison . Nobody has been criminally charged with their deaths, but Hernandez has been identified by police as a suspect. The 24-year-old Hernandez is being held without bail after pleading not guilty to murder in the unrelated death of 27-year-old Odin Lloyd in North Attleborough. Lloyd was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancee. Hernandez is now facing four lawsuits, including one by Lloyd's family and another by a former friend who alleges Hernandez shot him in the face. Earlier last week, the football players allegedly beat a fellow inmate while he was wearing handcuffs and could not defend himself. The former tight end has been separated from other prisoners at the Bristol County jail in Massachusetts since his arrest, but on Tuesday he was allowed to walk down into a common area. Victims: The families of Daniel Abreu, right, and Safiro Furtado, left, who were found shot to death in Boston two years ago filed the wrongful death lawsuits Wednesday in Suffolk Superior Court . Suspect: Hernandez hasn't been criminally charged in their deaths, but he has been identified by police as a suspect. They were found shot dead in a car, pictured, in July 2012 . Although usually only one inmate is allowed into this area at any time, Hernandez encountered another inmate who began harassing him, TMZ Sports reported. Hernandez, who was not wearing handcuffs, turned on him and the man, whose hands were restrained, was unable to defend himself, according to the website. Hernandez allegedly lunged at the unnamed man and severely beat him up. 'It was very brief,' Sheriff Thomas Hodgson said of the fight. 'The officers were right there and it was stopped within seconds, maybe a minute.' Neither required medical attention after the scrap. jail staff are interviewing witnesses and reviewing surveillance video to figure out exactly what happened and determine whether disciplinary measures or even criminal charges are warranted. They are also investigating how the men came to be in the area at the same time. Hodgson said he did not know of any previous tension between the two men. 'We don't know what, if any, relationship there was or has been at any point, either here or anywhere else,' Hodgson said. Both Hernandez and the other inmate have been moved to other units until the investigation is completed.","The families of Daniel Abreu and Safiro Furtado, who were found shot to death in Boston two years ago filed the complaints Wednesday .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 16:19 EST, 27 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 17:46 EST, 27 February 2014 . President Barack Obama has launched a new program to help African American and Latino boys with a personal speech during which he talked about the low points in his youth. 'I made bad choices. I got high, not . always thinking about the harm it could do. I didn't always take school . as seriously as I should have. I made excuses. Sometimes I sold myself . short,' Obama said in the East Room of the White House on Thursday. His comments about his teenage years came as he launched the program called 'My Brother's Keeper' which plans to strengthen efforts in creating more opportunities for young black and Latino men. Men of color: President Obama introduced a new program that will spend $200million over five years in an effort to help increase mentorship opportunities for young minorty Americans and strengthen family life . He said that the program aims to improve conditions that keep these young men impoverished and imprisoned in disproportionate numbers. Obama said these young men consistently do worse in society, with odds stacked against them. 'By almost every measure the group that's facing some of the most severe challenges in the 21st century in this country are boys and young men of color,' Obama said, ticking off statistics on fatherhood, literacy, crime and poverty. 'We assume this is an inevitable part of American life instead of the outrage that it is,' Obama said, to applause. He was not entirely pessimistic, noting that the fact that he was elected as a mark of improvement. 'My presence is a testament to that progress,' Obama said. Obama spoke while flanked by teenagers involved in the Becoming a Man program to help at-risk boys in his hometown of Chicago. He said he sees himself in them. Dodgy days: The President has spoken in the past about how he did drugs as a teenager, and saw that today's event was an appropriate time to bring it back up . Historic: The launch of the program is set to calm minority critics who have faulted the president for not doing enough while in office . Under Obama's initiative, businesses, foundations and community groups would coordinate their investments to come up with, or support, programs that keep youths in school and out of the criminal justice system, while improving their access to higher education. Several foundations pledged at least $200million over five years to promote that goal. Meanwhile, Obama signed a presidential memorandum creating a government-wide task force to evaluate the effectiveness of various approaches, so that federal and local governments, community groups and businesses will have best practices to follow in the future. Valerie Jarrett, a senior White House adviser, said Thursday marks the start of an effort that the president and first lady Michelle Obama plan to undertake 'for the rest of their lives.' 'That's a moral, social responsibility that they feel will transcend the time that he's president,' Jarrett said. Connecting: The President was introduced by Christian Champagne from Chicago, and the pair bonded over their mutual love of the hometown baseball team, the White Sox . Leadership: Like the other young men on the stage, Christian is a part of the Becoming A Man program which runs in Chicago that was used as a roadmap for the larger nationwide program launched today . Obama's pledge to take action came during his State of the Union address last month, when he warned that young, black men face ""especially tough odds to stay on track and reach their full potential.' Obama himself grew up in a single-parent household, and has said he and some members of his staff were challenged and tempted by the same societal ills plaguing younger generations of minority males. The White House listed a litany of facts showing the need for the effort: the unemployment rate for African-American men over the age of 20 was 12 per cent last month, compared with 5.4 per cent for white men. Hispanic men over the age of 20 faced an unemployment rate of 8.2 per cent. Special guests: Trayvon Martin's parents, Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin, were in the audience at Thursday's speech- the day after the second anniversary of Trayvon's death . Famous face: Former Los Angeles Laker Magic Johnson attended both the speech and a meeting about the initiative on Thursday . The U.S. Census Bureau showed a . poverty rate of 27.2 per cent in black households and 25.6 per cent for . Hispanic households in 2012, compared with 12.7 per cent in white and . 11.7 per cent in Asian households. The . phrase 'my brother's keeper' comes from the book of Genesis in the . Bible, where God asks Cain, the son of Adam and Eve, for the location of . his brother Abel, who Cain had killed. In . some versions, Cain replies: 'Am I my brother's keeper?' Obama has . quoted those Bible verses several times during his presidency, saying . Americans should look out for each other. Freed from the pressure of seeking re-election, Obama also has taken a more visible role on issues affecting minorities. The . president, who famously said â€” 'I'm not the president of black America. I'm the president of the United States of America' â€” has moved to . commute sentences for nonviolent drug offenders, hoping to combat . sentencing disparities that disproportionately imprison minorities. Mayors in (and out of) charge: Chicago Mayor and former Obama chief of staff Rahm Emanuel and former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg attended the event on Thursday . Attorney General Eric Holder, this month encouraged states to repeal laws that permanently bar felons from voting even after they have served their sentences. And Obama identified personally with the issue last year when he declared, after the acquittal of George Zimmerman, that Trayvon Martin, the black teenager killed in an encounter with Zimmerman in Florida, 'could have been me 35 years ago.' Both Trayvon's parents and the parents of Jordan Dunn, who was killed by a white man who got into an altercation with him about the volume of his music, were in the audience at Mr Obama's event today. The White House has been strongly criticized by some civil rights leaders for not using the presidential bully pulpit to do enough to address generations of disadvantage borne by the African-American community. But things are changing, said NAACP Interim President Lorraine Miller, who along with other civil rights groups met with the president in the White House last week.

Sharon Fowler, 43, filed a civil rights lawsuit against Paradise Lakes Resort last year after the association allegedly told her to get rid of the dog or move out. The mother, who suffers from a rare autoimmune disease that has taken her sight and soon her hearing, claims association members and residents repeatedly asked her to prove her disability, yelled at her in the street and said her service dog exceeded the community's weight limit. 'I felt demeaned, and I felt degraded,' Fowler told The Tampa Bay Times. 'I've never felt so degraded.' Angry: Sharon Fowler, 43, has filed a civil rights lawsuit against Paradise Lakes Resort after the association allegedly told her to get rid of her guide dog Laura or move out . Reliant: Sharon Fowler has relied on her guide dog since she was diagnosed with Leukocytoclastic Vasculitis several years ago . Fowler was diagnosed with Leukocytoclastic Vasculitis, an inflammation of the blood vessels, about four years ago. Her . veins and capillaries began breaking down before her vision was affected. She's had 13 surgeries and takes 15 . medications a day. Laura her four-year-old guide dog has been by her side for two-and-a-half years. 'She helps me to get around curbs and . obstacles,' Fowler said. 'She's 100 percent necessary to me. She's my lifeline.' Fowler said that when she moved with her family into the clothing optional-resort several years ago, her tenancy application specified that her guide dog weighed more than the association's 25-pound weight limit for pets. The application was approved. According to the website, Paradise Lakes Resort is 'a private, clothing optional hotel and resort' where 'you are welcome to be yourself in a tropical, fun filled setting.' 'If you are new to the world of clothing free or clothing optional way of life, you will find our policy of 'take off as much as you are comfortable with' to make the initial visits stress free,' the website adds. Dismayed: Fowler said she had lived peacefully at the resort for several months before the tone changed in August 2012 . Standing up for her rights: Sharon Fowler says she loves living at the nudist colony and doesn't want to move . Fowler said she lived peacefully at the resort for several months before the tone changed. In August 2012, the association sent her landlord a letter saying they needed to address the issue of the dog 'immediately'. They allegedly demanded that Fowler provide documentation proving her disability. Fowler said Paradise Lakes Condominium Association president, Lisa Caruso, allegedly told her she could only walk the dog in specific . areas and that it must move out of the way of pedestrians. She also claimed people yelled at her, saying her dog was badly behaved and that she didn't clean up after Laura. 'My dog is a highly trained service animal,' Fowler said. 'She is not out of control.' Caruso has consistently declined to comment to various media outlets, citing pending litigation.

A former PR firm employee claims he suffered relentless sexual harassment at the hands of two female co-workers and that his boss refused to intervene. Despite being told he was doing a good job, Joseph Jackson was fired this month from his $35,000-a-year position at Open Communications PR firm in New York. Jackson believes he was terminated because he formally complained about the harassment, so now he's suing the company, its CEO and the two aggressors. In a lawsuit filed Monday in New York, Jackson detailed the inappropriate and unwanted comments, texts and physical contact he received from fellow employees Katie Campisano and Sally O'Dowd. Advances in the workplace: Joseph Jackson claims he was sexually harassed by two women he worked with at Open Communications, a New York PR firm he was fired from this month . Aggresors: In the lawsuit filed in New York court on Monday, Jackson alleges that both Katie Campisano (left) and Sally O'Dowd (right) made inappropriate comments to him . In his position as Account Coordinator, Jackson worked with Campisano and O'Dowd to pitch clients and write press releases. O'Dowd, one of the co-founders of the company, was Jackson's superior but started flirting with him when he attended her birthday party along with other co-workers in August, the lawsuit says. At the end of the party, O'Dowd came up to him and allegedly hugged him three times. While hugging him, Jackson says O'Dowd whispered in his ear, 'You are so handsome,' 'You are so awesome,' and 'You are so talented' before kissing him on the back of the neck. Touching: The harassment from O'Dowd started at her birthday party in August when she came up to Jackson and hugged him three times and even kissed him on the neck . He says he didn't hug O'Dowd back and immediately left the restaurant 'distraught'. In the following months, that harassment entered the office with Jackson claiming O'Dowd forcibly touched his abs, massaged his arms, kissed his neck and constantly told him how 'sexy' he was. 'I've been doing these exercises and crunches. My body is so fit and tight. Poke my abdomen,' she allegedly told him on December 18, and then forcibly brought his hand to her stomach when he refused. Confident: On one occasion, Jackson says O'Dowd forced him to touch her ads because her body was 'so fit and tight' from her exercising . She would also talk about her dates and sexual encounters with him, and said several times how much she loved young black and Hispanic men. In one instance detailed in the suit, O'Dowd told Jackson by the water cooler: 'You remind me of my hot young Puerto Rican lover Apollo'. And Jackson says O'Dowd wasn't the only one giving him unwanted attention. He's also claiming harassment by co-worker Katie Campisano and in the lawsuit says she sent him a text message in November asking: 'When are we going to have our bang sesh?' Other inappropriate texts exposed in the suit include 'I'm going to need you to be my next boyfriend Joseph' and you 'may be easier to bang when we're not coworkers'. Sexting: In the suit Jackson says Campisano sent him inappropriate texts, including one asking: 'When are we going to have our bang sesh?' In November, when they got a new condom client, Campisano tested the product on a banana and remarked that it was 'tight around the base'. 'It probably wouldn't fit Joseph,' she allegedly said. All the while, Jackson says he complained about the harassment, making it known how uncomfortable he was. He says he first formally complained in October to company CEO John Andrew Morris who said he was sorry and would 'look into it'. But Jackson says Morris ignored the complaint and wouldn't even intervene when he witnessed some of the harassment. In December, O'Dowd was in a room with both Morris and Jackson and made the comment: 'I get to stand next to Joseph and his sexy biceps'. Instead of calling her out, Morris simply shrugged his shoulders and rolled his eyes. Out of left field: After formally complaining about the harassment on three occasions, Jackson was fired on February 21 right after being told he was doing a good job and given more responsibilities . Jackson complained about the harassment two more times in the subsequent months, but Morris still refused to do anything, he says. Moving up: Campisano received a promotion and a raise, despite Jackson bringing up the sexual harassment complaints . He even claims he was victimized after making the complaints, getting an increased workload and more and more negative feedback. When he informed the CEO about the additional harassment from Campisano, Morris allegedly laughed and brushed them off. Campisano was even promoted and given a raise following the complaints. In November, around the time of Jackson's second complaint, Morris called him 'a hater that needed to be removed' in front of other employees. 'I don't understand what the problem is. You're doing good here,' Morris allegedly told Jackson when he continued to complain. Which . is why his firing on February 21 came as a surprise. In addition to . Morris telling him he was doing a good job, Jackson was also given the . responsibility to lead social media events right before his sacking. Jackson . is now suing for lost wages, benefits, emotional distress and punitive . damages and stands to get as much as seven figures if he wins. Peter Gallagher, a lawyer representing the company and its employees in the lawsuit told Mailonline they are 'very confident though the court process that the truth is going to come out and our clients are going to be exonerated.'

'My son is missing,' she told the operator through tears. 'He's like four days old... I put him to sleep in his crib and now he’s not there.' A friend or relative of Brianna then took the phone and told the operator: 'Her sister was here earlier. Her sister’s gone and the baby’s gone.'

Paul Augustus Howell, 48, was pronounced dead Wednesday evening following a lethal injection at the Florida State Prison in Starke . A drug trafficker who placed a pipe bomb in a gift-wrapped microwave oven in a plot to kill two potential murder witnesses was executed for the 1992 death of a Florida highway officer who became the unintended victim. Paul Augustus Howell, 48, was pronounced dead Wednesday evening following a lethal injection at the Florida State Prison in Starke, the office of Gov. Rick Scott said in an email. He became the 15th man to be executed in the state since Mr Scott became governor in 2011. Howell, a native of Jamaica, was condemned for the killing of Jimmy Fulford on February 1, 1992, when the package exploded during a traffic stop. When the prison curtain opened revealing the execution witnesses, Howell, who had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich as his last meal, opened his eyes wide and lifted his head to stare at those gathered. He began praying. Asked if he had any words, he apologized to Fulford's family and gave a two-minute statement detailing the events of the crime and placing blame on a friend for letting the bomb go off. No one from Fulford's family witnessed the execution or gave a statement. Howell built the bomb in his home and placed it in the microwave oven, court documents stated. He then paid another man, Lester Watson, $200 to deliver the box to a woman who, along with a friend, could tie Howell to a drug-related murder, according to the records. But Fulford pulled Watson over for speeding, and the bomb was never delivered to the intended target. Instead, Watson was arrested after giving a false name and birthdate. Watson also gave Fulford permission to search the car rented in Howell's name. When the 35-year-old officer opened the package and looked to see what was in the microwave oven, the bomb exploded.

Had the blast occurred in Tammie Bailey's apartment - the woman who was supposed to have received the bomb - it would have been powerful enough to blow out doors and walls, potentially killing anyone in the apartment as well as neighbors, according to court documents. Fulford's death prompted a state and federal investigation that broke apart a drug ring and led to the indictment of 28 people. Howell was sentenced to life on federal drug charges. His lawyers had filed an unsuccessful appeal Tuesday to the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing that a new drug Florida uses for executions wasn't tested for that purpose.

The phone system at Los Angeles International Airport failed during the deadly shooting in Terminal 3 last November - leaving police who first responded to the scene with no idea where the gunman was, it has been revealed today. Investigators who are probing the security response to the attack, allegedly carried out by 24-year-old Paul Ciancia armed with an assault rifle, found a series of alarming problems with the communications systems at LAX that could have cost officers more than 90 critical seconds to find the shooting, two officials told the Associated Press. Phone terminals at Transportation and Security Administration checkpoints didn't transmit the caller's location to 911 dispatchers - as they were designed to do. When a TSA agent called 911 as the shooting began and then fled as the gunman drew closer, emergency operators and police were in the dark about where exactly the call has come from. One official likened the situation to a 911 call but police not . knowing what address to go to. Airport dispatchers knew something was . wrong but didn't know where to send help because the system didn't . identify locations of its emergency phones. Failure: Police who responded to initial reports of a shooting at Los Angeles International Airport in November didn't know where the 911 call came from . Additionally, a review found that panic buttons throughout the airport - including many in Terminal 3 - did not work and cell phone calls to 911 were routed to the California Highway Patrol or Los Angeles Police Department instead of nearby airport police dispatchers. When the gunman entered the airport, a screening supervisor in the sprawling airport's Terminal 3 picked up the phone but fled before responding to a dispatcher's questions because the assailant was approaching with a high-powered rifle and spraying bullets, according to two officials briefed on preliminary findings of a review of the emergency response to the November 1 incident. After asking questions and receiving no answers, the dispatcher hung up. An airline contractor working in the terminal called dispatch directly from his cellphone, and officers were dispatched 90 seconds after the shooting. Douglas Laird, a former security director for Northwest Airlines who owns an aviation security consulting business, said most emergency phone systems he's seen indicate the origin of a call. If 'dispatch doesn't know where the call is coming from, that shows there's a serious flaw, obviously,' said Laird, who has conducted security surveys at about 100 airports around the world. He was not involved in the review of the LA airport shooting. Officials with Los Angeles World Airport, the agency that runs LAX, declined to comment on any aspects of the review until the report is issued next month. Gun battle: This surveillance image shows the spot where alleged gunman Paul Ciancia was shot and wounded by police officers . The broad review of the emergency response included interviews with airport staff, law enforcement and first responders, reviews of camera footage, dispatch logs and 911 calls. While it found that the response was swift, the investigation conducted by airport staff and an outside contractor also identified a number of problems. Among them: . The attack killed Transportation Security Administration Officer Gerardo Hernandez and injured two other TSA officers and a passenger. Paul Ciancia, 24, who'd moved from Pennsville, New Jersey, to Los Angeles two years prior, is accused of targeting TSA officers. He has pleaded not guilty to 11 federal charges, including murder of a federal officer. Earlier AP reporting revealed that the only two armed airport police officers assigned to the area of the shooting weren't in Terminal 3 at the time. Both were on breaks and had yet to notify dispatchers, as required, so neither was in position to call in the shooting. Once dispatchers put out the call for help 90 seconds later, it took nearly two more minutes before armed officers arrived. Ciancia was shot and taken into custody near gate 35, deep inside the terminal, soon afterward. Airport police couldn't get to the shooter or the victims as quickly because of the phone snafus . The AP also found that it took 33 minutes for Hernandez to be wheeled out of the terminal to waiting medical personnel. He was pronounced dead at the hospital after surgeons worked on him for an hour. A coroner's news release later said he likely was dead within two to five minutes after being shot multiple times. In response to the shooting, the Los Angeles Fire Department already has announced it will train more tactical paramedics who can more quickly enter dangerous areas. Los Angeles police are training their officers on how to use combat-style trauma kits. TSA Officer Victor Payes, who has worked at LAX for six years and is former president of the local union, said the inability of dispatchers to locate the origin of the emergency call highlights local TSA officers' concerns about overall communication with airport police. He said no general instruction on how to use the phones has been provided. 'A lot of these protocols that have been set up, we find, at least on the TSA end, it's supervisor-driven, and the employees, the subordinates, do not necessarily know many of the protocols,' Payes said. 'If someone told me to pick up the phone, I wouldn't know what to say.' The review recommends instituting emergency protocol and evacuation training for all airport employees . 'We realize in incidents like this, how quick you are or how fast you are at responding to incidents is generally going to be the difference between how many people get hurt or don't get hurt,' Airport Police Chief Patrick Gannon said in a recent interview. He said the airport in its review had looked at ways to speed up notification from TSA, dispatch and also within the airport itself. Since the shooting, Gannon said airport staff worked to ensure that all airport employees have the airport police dispatch number in their cellphones.","TSA agent called 911, but had to hang up as gunman approached .
Police dispatcher could not tell where the call was made from and police scrambled to find the shooter .
Glitch likely cost 90 seconds in response time .
One TSA agent was killed and two were wounded in the November 1 shooting .
Broken 'panic buttons' that when hit are supposed to automatically call for help and activate a camera giving airport police a view of the area reporting trouble. Two of the dozen or so buttons in Terminal 3 weren't working and several others around the airport were defective. Later testing revealed that another terminal's system of buttons was down and airport police beefed up patrols until it was fixed, one of the officials said. Though TSA officers told airport officials that an officer hit the panic button, there's no evidence - video or electronic - it happened.
Anyone calling 911 at the airport is routed to the California Highway Patrol or Los Angeles Police Department, not airport police dispatchers.
The airport has no system allowing for simultaneous emergency announcements throughout the complex.
Most cameras in the terminal provided fixed and often limited views of areas or weren't located at key spots such as curbs, making it difficult for investigators to learn how and where the gunman arrived at the airport."

When they later called to ask if he wanted to report a crime, he confessed that he did the damage himself. Richie Incognito has confessed to damaging his own $300,000 Ferrari with a baseball bat . Officers were called to the sportsman's home after a neighbour reported the damage, but found the troubled player wasn't home. When they called him later he said he'd caused the damage himself . This unexplained attack, first reported by TMZ, is just the latest bizarre outburst by Incognito following allegations that he led a bullying ring while playing for the Dolphins which forced tackle Johnathan Martin out of the team. On Friday a report was released which named him as a bullying ringleader within the Dolphins' locker room, prompting a Twitter rant from Incognito that he couldn't be defined 'in 144 years let alone 144 pages.' He also criticised former teammate Martin, saying the report would 'bury' the claims against him. However, on Monday and Tuesday night . he returned to the social networking site to 'apologize for acting like a . big baby the last few days,' adding that 'This has all been so much on . me and my family. I just want to play football.' Incognito also changed tack with Martin by calling him his 'brother' and saying 'no hard feelings'. Incognito has been accused of leading a bullying ring which targetted Johnathan Martin, a tackle who left the team mid-season . Last week, after a report was published naming Incognito as the figurehead of the alleged bullying ring, Incognito launched into a Twitter rant before apologising to teammates and coaches . Last week, the investigation into the racially charged Miami Dolphins bullying scandal detailed widespread harassment in the team's locker room that extended beyond the two players at the centre of the probe. The NFL-ordered report stated there was a 'pattern of harassment' committed by at least three players and extended to two lineman and an assistant trainer, all targets of vicious taunts and racist insults. Lawyer Ted Wells released the report, saying guard John Jerry and center Mike Pouncey followed Richie Incognito's lead in harassing Jonathan Martin, who left the team in October. They threatened to rape his sister, called him a long list of slurs and bullied him for not being 'black enough. Incognito's attorney, Mark Schamel, released a statement calling Wells' report 'replete with errors' and said that Martin 'was never bullied by Richie Incognito or any member of the Dolphins' offensive line.'","Police were called to his home after reports of damage from neighbours .

A Delaware elementary school teacher found guilty of having sex with one of her 13-year-old students is trying to have her 10-year prison sentence reduced. Rachel Holt was 34 when she was charged with 28 counts of raping a minor in 2006. She pleaded guilty to one count of second-degree rape and was handed a mandatory 10-year sentence. Investigators said the science teacher had sex with the boy more than 25 times in just over a week, and on one occasion let his 12-year-old friend watch. Appeal: Science teacher Rachel Holt is trying to have her 10-year sentence for rape commuted . The board of pardons is scheduled on Thursday to hear a commutation request from Holt, who used to work at Claymont Elementary School. A previous request to have her sentence commuted was rejected in 2010. At the hearing, deputy attorney-general James Kriner said: 'It hasn't been proven to my satisfaction that she doesn't pose a threat to other teenage boys,' according to the Star Democrat . Court documents showed that Holt had been disciplined by the school for 'inappropriate behavior' including sitting on the laps of male students, and driving them home in her car. In January 2006, just a few months before she started having sex with a 13-year-old student, the school principal, Betty Pinchin, had received several complaints from parents about Holt. Disciplined: The principal of Claymont Elementary School in Delaware had suspended Holt for inappropriate behavior before she went on to have sex with a 13-year-old student . The concerns included that the science teacher was 'instant messaging kids 10.00 at night' and 'becoming more of a buddy tha[n] a teacher'. In March 2006 she was suspended for three days after a parent volunteer observed her kissing and hugging a student in the library. She returned to work on March 16 and began a sexual relationship with a 13-year-old on March 24.","Rachel Holt pleaded guilty to one count of rape over sexual relationship with teenager in 2006 .

A friend of the late Benihana founder Rocky Aioki has claimed his third wife Keiko 'nursed, fed and tended to' her husband ahead of his death, while his children were nowhere to be found. The news comes after Keiko Ono Aoki's lawyer Richard Feldman countersued on her behalf Monday in the latest installment of a bitter feud over his $35million fortune. Court papers accuse Aoki's six children, including model Devon Aoki, of swindling a 'deathbed distribution' worth millions out of the restauranteur the day before he passed away in 2008. But the children claim it's allowable for their father to distribute them income during his lifetime. Better times: Rocky Aoki and wife Keiko Ono Aoki pose while attending a 2008 charity benefit . They already received $7 million from . insurance before appearing at the hospital in Aoki's last hours to ask . for another $3 million. In the New York Post's Page Six, Cindy Adams, who says she was a close friend of Aioki's from the start of his successful . teppanyaki business, says Keiko was there for her husband until the end, . while his children weren't around. 'In his fragility, no kids were around. Keiko nursed, fed, tended him. I saw it,' Adams writes. She said Keiko also tried to settle . the children's lawsuits but they refused. So she decided to sue the siblings and their respective lawyers. She . only gained control of the $35 million estate last year, and her late . husband's children claim the money was from a trust she had no rights . over, according to an earlier report in the New York Post. In documents, Keiko claims Devon, her DJ brother Steve Aoki, and their four siblings looted the cash from their ailing father July 9, 2008 as he 'lay dying in his hospital bed.' Rocky Aoki realized the American dream with his vast empire of teppanyaki restaurants where food is theatrically grilled at the same table diners eat at. He set up a trust for his children 10 years prior to his death after being convicted of insider trading. Model daughter: Devon Aoki has made a name for herself acting in movies, gracing magazine covers and walking runways around the world . Famous: Daughter Devon, pictured, is known for movie roles such as 'Sin City' and walking runways all over the world . The former Japanese Olympic wrestling . qualifier named sons Kevin and Kyle, daughter Kana Grace and close . friend Kenneth Podziba trustees – Keiko Ono Aoki was not named. Trusts grant trustees the right to distribute funds at their discretion – which happened to be the eve of their patriarch's death. 'Keiko had no more right to notice [of the money transfer] than did Rocky's doctors or chauffeur, as she is not a named beneficiary,' a court filing cited by the Post claims. The pair married in 2002 without a prenuptial agreement. The . founder had previously sued his children over the attempts to wrestle . control over his steakhouse empire from him after he had children by at . least three different women, according to New York magazine. The money was handed out at that time because two of his children were 'in dire need' of cash, a source told the paper. The funds were distributed equally among the six children. The empire: Rocky Aoki built a fortune on theatrical teppanyaki dining in his Benihana restaurants . Daughter Devon, known for movie roles . such as 'Sin City' and walking runways all over the world, and son . Steve, a DJ who tours the world and has permanent residence in a Las . Vegas nightclub, were not likely among those who needed cash - but they . still received their cuts. Keiko Ono Aoki is now CEO of Benihana and has overseen expansion to 100 locations around the world, according to the company's website. Her . late husband qualified for the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome but did not . compete, instead choosing to barnstorm around the United States where . he went undefeated. Rocky leveraged the fame garnered from three consecutive national championships to open the first Benihana in 1964 in Midtown Manhattan. He died of pneumonia the day following the cash grab. Podziba declined to comment when reached by the Post, the attorney for Keiko told the paper the dispute was 'not uncommon.'","Benihana founder Hiroaki 'Rocky' Aoki died July 10, 2008 .

Brittney Cason during her time with the Carolina Panthers before she switched to broadcasting . An ex-NFL cheerleader-turned-sports journalist almost became a victim of human sex trafficking at the Sochi Olympics when she was recruited for a reporting job that turned out to be bogus. Brittney Cason from Charlotte, North Carolina, was approached by a talent agent hiring U.S. reporters to cover the Winter Olympics last September. Writing on xojane.com, she explained how she became suspicious when - after a lengthy application process - the 'agent' asked her if she had any 'girlfriends' she could take with her, offering them visas with no interview process, eventually prompting action from the FBI. Ms Cason was contacted in September 2013 via her website by a man claiming to be a talent acquisition agent. 'Given my background in sports broadcasting...  and working on sports talk radio, it made sense he was recruiting me,' she wrote. Ms Cason was asked to submit examples of her work, and audition several times, before she was told that she had got the job with the network as a host and beat reporter for the games. In addition to Ms Cason, she was told that another legitimate sportscaster in North Carolina was hired to work alongside her. Her suspicions were raised two weeks before she was set to leave for Sochi, when the 'talent agent' said he needed to expand the coverage team and asked if she had any 'girlfriends' in the industry she could recommend. His assistant, who was actually just him, sent her documents for her friend to get a work visa. Brittney Cason said her suspicions were raised two weeks before she was due to leave for Sochi, when the 'agent' said he needed to expan the coverage team and asked if she had any 'girlfriends' she could recomment . Ms Cason says that so many of the trafficking stories she has heard started with someone being told they were hired for a modelling job . Ms Cason said: 'I spent four months applying and interviewing and he's sending my friend a work visa without even seeing her work? 'Now, my friend is really talented, but wanting her passport and social security number before her reel (reporting and presenting clips) just seemed fishy to me.' Ms Cason contacted the other sportscaster who was supposed to be going to Sochi with her and they investigated the talent agency further. She said: 'She and I concocted a plan to contact the production company in LA directly to check his credentials without stepping on his toes in the event we were just being paranoid.' Upon their investigation it turned out that the production company didn't know who he was, and advised them not to travel to Russia, and instead contact lawyers, who eventually contacted the F.B.I. Targeted by sex traffickers: Ms Cason said the man exerted a lot of effort to pose as legitimate and posed as a 'devout family man'. On the day she was supposed to leave, she was negotiating with her lawyers . Ms Cason remarked how she was shocked at the amount of effort the 'talent agent' had put in to the scheme. She said: 'The man exerted as much effort as a full time job to pose as legitimate - and never once crossed the line. 'Rather, he posed as a devout family man - We got the results back and suddenly needed the F.B.I.' On the day that she was set to leave, bags packed and flights booked, Cason was instead negotiating with her lawyers and the F.B.I, as it turned out that the 'talent acquisition agency' was most likely a front for a sex trafficking ring. The Olympic Games - including the winter games at Sochi - are a huge draw for trafficking: Aid workers said American women are typically sold for more in foreign countries . According to Jillian Mourning, founder of the non-profit All We Want is Love, a charity that attempts to help victims of human trafficking, it is common for men to pose as talent agents in order to lure and traffic women. Ms Cason said: 'So many of the stories I've heard from survivors start with ""I was hired for a modelling job"".' Mourning told her: 'The Olympics is a huge draw for trafficking. 'It's a major sporting event in a foreign country, and American women are typically sold for more in foreign countries.' Ms Cason added: 'Either way, this wasn't going to end well. 'Unfortunately I am not the daughter of Liam Neeson, so I wouldn't have had a happy ending had I gotten on a plane. 'For any young girl wanting to get into the business the first step is to seek a credible agent. 'If you have to pay money for an audition, that's a red flag for a business scam.'","Brittney Cason was approached by a 'talent acquisition agent'

As Obama prepares to pull all U.S. troops from Afghanistan by 2015, NATO’s secretary-general has warned against a full withdrawal. President Obama has made clear his desire to draw down troops from the war-torn nation by year's end, and the U.S. and NATO may not be left with a choice as Afghan leader Hamid Karzai still refuses to sign a security agreement. NATO’s Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen has said that a full withdrawal of NATO troops is not desirable and that it would be detrimental to the people of Afghanistan. Scroll down for video . NATO¿s Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen has said that a full withdrawal of NATO troops would be detrimental to the people of Afghanistan . Barack Obama may be playing a game of chicken with Hamid Karzai, designed to force the Afghan leader's hand before he passes off power later this year . NATO defence ministers agreed on . Thursday to plan for all options for the alliance's future presence in . Afghanistan, including a possible pullout of all its troops this year, . Fogh Rasmussen said. ‘Today . we agreed the need to plan for all possible outcomes including the . possibility that we may not be able to deploy to Afghanistan after 2014 . due to the persistent delays we have seen,’ the NATO Secretary-General . told a news conference. On Wednesday, Rasmussen said he still hoped plans to keep troops in Afghanistan beyond this year could be salvaged. ‘Let . me be clear that this is not the outcome we want,’ Rasmussen said, . referring to the option of no NATO troops staying behind in Afghanistan . after this year. ‘It is not . the outcome we think is in the interest of the Afghan people. However, . it might be the unfortunate outcome if there is no security agreement in . due time. This is what is at stake.’ U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, right, talks with Fogh Rasmussen prior to the start of a meeting of NATO defense ministers at NATO headquarters in Brussels today . Taliban insurgents continue to rain destruction on Afghanistan's cities and villages, continuing the West's quest to deploy just the right amount of muscle in response . Sad sack? Pentagon chief Chuck Hagel had to tell reporters on Monday that U.S. military strength would be pared back to ts levels in 1940 . Without . going as far as the zero option, NATO could also look at scaling back . its current plan, which calls for a training mission headquartered in . Kabul and four regional bases, and focus instead on the capital, . diplomats say . In the U.S. Tuesday marked the first time a scenario has been discussed publicly . that would completely void Afghanistan of U.S. personnel who have been . vital in fighting Taliban militias. 'President . Obama has asked the Pentagon to ensure that it has adequate plans in . place to accomplish an orderly withdrawal by the end of the year should . the United States not keep any troops in Afghanistan after 2014,' the . White House said Tuesday morning. That . message was part of a phone call between Obama and Afghan leader Hamid . Karzai on Tuesday, during which the U.S. president reportedly pressured . him to accept the terms of a Bilateral Security Agreement (BSA) that has . been pending for months. The . Obama administration has made the agreement, drafted in November, a . requirement if it is to leave a counter-terrorism force in Karzai's . country after the larger U.S. pullout is complete. Karzai has been putting off the decision to sign the BSA, saying that it should be left for his successor. Afghan President Hamid Karzai wants to pass the decision about an American security agreement to his successor, but that may leave a US-dependent NATO with too little time to plan its 2015 deployments . Elections will be held in April to choose the next president. But . that process could drag on for months since Afghanistan's presidential . election process is a two-stage system that may not be complete until . July or August. A . Defense Department source told MailOnline that existing Pentagon plans . call for as many as 10,000 troops to remain behind, split between . training forces and special operators equipped to raid Taliban . strongholds. But . those plans are fluid. And since so many NATO allies in Afghanistan . depend on U.S. troops for logistical support and just-in-time war . materiel, those world powers are finding it hard to plan without a clear . nod from the Americans. And . Obama's decision is already limiting the choices of a NATO panel of . defense ministers meeting this week in Brussels, Belgium. The . NATO group is weighing how many troops to place in Afghanistan next . year, and the political tug-of-war between Washington and Kabul promises . to wreak havoc with those plans. If . Karzai's successor isn't in place until the end of the summer, the . Pentagon source cautioned, NATO will find itself in a time crunch with . just months or weeks left to finalize deployment decisions. U.S. troops are a common sight -- for now -- in Kabul, where at least one person was killed and four others were wounded during a bombing . Most . of the major-party contenders for the Afghan presidency have spoken in . favor of the U.S. agreement, but NATO generals and the Pentagon don't . want to premise billions of dollars in logistical moves on the uncertain . outcome of a Middle Eastern election. 'We will leave open the possibility of concluding a BSA with Afghanistan later this year,' the White House said Tuesday. Ouch: Former Vice President Dick Cheney said Tuesday that President Obama would rather spend federal dollars on food stamps than on a strong military . 'However, . the longer we go without a BSA, the more challenging it will be to plan . and execute any U.S. mission. Furthermore, the longer we go without a . BSA, the more likely it will be that any post-2014 U.S. mission will be . smaller in scale and ambition.' Karzai has been cantankerous and his commitments have become more elusive as the U.S. has withdrawn platoon after platoon. But the Pentagon knows that he can't run for the top post again. His war of words with Obama may be a case of one lame duck speaking to another – the worst circumstance for Obama's latest move if it's just an Oval Office bluff. The Defense Department, however, insists that the president may actually order a complete withdrawal after the NATO meeting in Belgium, where Secretary of State Chuck Hagel will represent U.S. interests. 'Without question, the issues surrounding the future of the Afghan mission will certainly be discussed in Brussels, to include the challenges of retrograde and force posture faced by all Allies,' Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told The Guardian. 'We long said that we would like a BSA as soon as possible. Absent that,' he vowed, 'we would have to start planning to withdraw all our forces by the end of the year.'","Obama has made it clear that he wishes to pull troops by 2015 .

The 2014 Sochi Winter Olympic Games cost more than the combined total of all other Olympic Winter Games to date at a staggering £30 billion and now Russia faces the epic task of deciding what to do next with its Olympic infrastructure. Looking back at past host cities, none is more tragic than  Sarajevo, which hosted the 1984 Winter Games. Held in the former Yugoslavia, it was the first the games to be held in a communist country and more than  1,272 athletes from 49 countries took part. Telling the tales of a war torn city, 30 years later, the remnants of the once proud Olympic facilities are decaying and rotting - nothing but crumbling buildings over grown with weeds and marked with bullet holes and graffiti. Ruins: A view of the disused ski jump used in the games. Covered in rubble, the jumps are located on Mount Igman, near Sarajevo . Today people walk past the logo of the Sarajevo Winter Olympics. Facilities were destroyed and left to crumble in during war in the '90s which tore the former Yugoslavia apart . Beating out Swedish and Japanese candidate cities to host the games, Sarajevo was seen as an ideal choice because there was less chance of Cold War counties boycotting the non-aligned former Yugoslavia. Sarajevo was also seen as a symbol of world peace in a country synonymous with the outbreak of WWII. It was also a chance for the former country to present itself to the world in the best possible light. While the games remain a highlight in Sarajevo's history, in stark contrast to its proudest moment, eight years later the Bosnian War erupted. A siege on Sarajevo, lasting about four years, did untold damage and was the longest on a capital city in modern warfare. Once symbols of peace, Sarajevo's Olympic facilities became a bloody battleground. Fighters used the Olympic site to store weaponry, while the bobsled track, located outside Sarajevo on Mount Trebevic, was used as an artillery stronghold for Bosnian-Serbs. Today defensive holes drilled by troops remain along with graffiti. Other facilities including the jumps remain unused and land mines remain buried in the mountains. With between 10,000 and 14,000 people estimated killed in the siege of Sarajevo, the middle of the Olympic arena was used as a mass cemetery. An abandoned judge's room for the ski jump has been left to deteriorate in the 30 years since it was used by officials during the Winter Olympics . The Olympic rings can still be seen on the neglected jump which has been left to fall apart as nearby vegetation grows wild . Deserted facilities have become a target for vandals who have graffitied the remaining structures which sit eerily idle . Once used for one of the games' highlight events, the bobsleigh is covered in moss and vegetation as it is left to decay .

Pictured is an image taken from the video . Pettijohn posted his video to YouTube on Sunday, in which he tells the 18-year-old how watching her skate had 'made me realise how perfect we are for each other'. The video, which had gained more than 116,000 views by this morning, features the California high school student in various locations at his home in Malibu, offering reasons why they would be a good match, including the line: 'You're gorgeous, my mom thinks I'm pretty.' In the next scene, as he is out for a jog in his training vest and shorts, he tells her: 'You're an Olympic athlete, I made varsity.' Other reasons he gives include the fact they both live at the beach and are blonde. He even makes a brave attempt at looking 'graceful' on the ice. At the end of the video he tells her: 'This would be the perfect end to my high school career and make my Olympic dreams come true.' He goes on to say: 'The Olympic judges got it wrong, you're the only Gold I see.'

Police in Halifax, Canada, announced Wednesday that they have found the body of a pregnant college student who went missing nearly two weeks ago. Loretta Saunders, 26, was discovered dead on a median off Route 2 of the Trans-Canada Highway in New Brunswick - more than 450 miles from her hometown of Halifax. Saunders, a criminology major in Saint Mary's University who had written a thesis about missing and murdered aboriginal women, was last seen February 13 on her way to collect rent from her tenants. Tragic end: Pregnant college student . Loretta Saunders, 26 (pictured), was found dead off a road in New Brunswick nearly two weeks after she was seen leaving an apartment . building in Halifax, Nova Scotia . Resting place: Saunders' remains were discovered near the Trans-Canada Highway in New Brunswick . Law enforcement officials said they have ruled Miss Saunders’ death a homicide and have identified the suspects in her slaying, National Post reported. The victim’s two tenants have been previously arrested in Ontario, some 2,000 miles from Halifax, for allegedly stealing Saunders' car. On a mission: Saunders was last seen going to pick up rent from sketchy tenants Victoria Henneberry, 28 (left), and Blake Leggette, 25 (right). When she turned up at the apartment, the couple was not there and they didn't leave a check, so she called to tell them they needed to move out . According . to a statement released by police, Saunders’ remains were found at . around 4.30pm Wednesday off a road west of Salisbury. Police . are not saying if Blake Leggette and Victoria Hennenberry, who have . been renting Saunders' apartment, will face charges in her murder, but . officials said they are not looking for any other suspects. Both Leggette, 25, and Henneberry, 28, have been extradited from Ontario back to Halifax to face charges of theft of vehicle. Miss . Saunders was last seen alive on surveillance footage leaving the . Halifax apartment she started renting to Henneberry and Leggette last . month. Just six days . after her February 13 disappearance, the couple were busted over 2,000 . miles away at a friend's house in Harrow, Ontario with Saunders' car and . debit card. Yalcin Surkultay, Saunders' boyfriend of two years, was the last to see the three-months pregnant . woman, who just recently finished her undergraduate thesis on Aboriginal . women who had gone missing or were murdered in Canada. The two were living together after she started renting her own apartment in a high-rise building to help cover school expenses. Victim: Police have classified Saunders' death as a homicide and said they have identified the suspects and are not looking for additional ones . Facing justice: Both  Leggette (left) and Henneberry (right) have been sent back to Halifax to face car theft charges . But Saunders had been having a hard time collecting $700 in rent from the tenants she met on classifieds site Kijiji, so she was going to get the funds in person. 'She went to get her rent Thursday and said if they didn't have it she'll tell them they have to leave.' her brother Edmund Saunders told the National Post. 'When she got there they weren't home. She phoned them, apparently, and told them they had to leave.' That was the last time she was seen . in person. CCTV footage caught her leaving the building, and it doesn't . seem like she was followed. On camera: Security camera footage shows Saunders leaving the apartment building she started renting to Henneberry and Leggette in January, and it doesn't seem like she was followed . Taken: Six days after Saunders went missing, her tenants were found more than 2,000 miles away with her stolen car . Long way from home: Saunders went missing form Halifax, her car was found 2,000 miles away in Harrow, and her body was discovered in New Brunswick . Hideout: The couple were found and arrested at a friend's house in Harrow, Ontario . At one point, her boyfriend received a . bizarre text message saying she had locked herself out of her online . banking account and couldn't remember her mother's maiden name to unlock . it. Saunders also had a 'suspiciously short' text message conversation with her sister on Friday, and then ceased all contact. Saunders was officially reported missing February 17 when she went a long time without contacting her father. The . following evening, authorities tracked down Henneberry and Leggette . more than 2,000 miles away, staying at a friends house in Harrow, . Ontario. They had driven there in Saunders' blue 2000 Toyota Celica and had been using her debit card since the day she went missing. Full of life: Sanders lived with her boyfriend of three years, Yalcin Surkultay (right), and was said to be excited about becoming a mother . Student: Saunders had been studying sociology . and criminology at Saint Mary's University for the past three years and . wrote her undergraduate thesis on Aboriginal women who had been murdered . or gone missing . Will she ever be seen again? Saunders family is organizing search efforts in Halifax, but her brother admitted that they fear the worst . The couple were arrested on charges of possessing a stolen vehicle, but they were also discovered to be fugitives in other provinces on unrelated charges. Leggette had an outstanding warrant for not appearing in Calgary court while his girlfriend Henneberry was wanted for threatening someone in Halifax in 2011. Originally from Hopedale, . Newfoundland, Saunders was an aspiring lawyer who spent the last three . years studying  sociology and criminology as an undergraduate at Saint . Mary's University.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 15:35 EST, 27 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 17:37 EST, 27 February 2014 . A 30-year-old man who allegedly laced his pregnant girlfriend's pancakes with an abortion-inducing drug, killing the fetus, has been charged with first-degree murder. Scott Robert Bollig, from Wakeeney, Kansas, allegedly crushed up the drug on January 26 before giving it to his girlfriend, 36-year-old Naomi Abbott, who was between eight and ten weeks pregnant. She later miscarried the fetus, but the Kansas Attorney General's office would not say when. Authorities also did not reveal how Abbott learned that she had been poisoned. On Wednesday, Attorney General Derek Schmidt filed formal criminal charges against Bollig, who was arrested February 20. His bond was set at $500,000. Charged: Scott Bollig, left, allegedly crushed up abortion-inducing drugs and gave them to his girlfriend, Naomi Abbott, right, who was eight to ten weeks pregnant. The fetus was killed, authorities said . 'Bolling did, then and there, unlawfully, feloniously and intentionally commit an overt act, to wit: putting a crushed form of a medication used to terminate an intrauterine pregnancy on food,' charging documents state. The complaint, which does not name the medication that was used or how it was obtained, says Abbott suffered 'great bodily harm' following Bollig's alleged actions. A spokesman for the attorney general's office said only the information in the complaint would be released. Prosecutors will also ask the jury to consider charges of attempted murder in the first degree, aggravated battery and distribution of adulterated food. Bollig's lawyer, Daniel Walter, told the Salina Journal that he could not discuss any more specifics about the case, but said that he intends to challenge the law used to charge his client. Home: Bollig lives in Trego County, Kansas (pictured), where the alleged crime occurred last month . While authorities have not revealed the drug Billig used to induce Abbott's abortion, other recent cases have involved Misoprostol, also known by its commercial name, Cytotec. Misoprostol was initially FDA approved for the prevention and treatment of ulcers, but can also be used to induce labor or miscarriages of early-term pregnancies. It is about 88 per cent effective up to eight weeks gestation, and is believed to be a cheaper and less invasive alternative to surgical abortion, if taken early enough. The statute, Alexa's Law, allows prosecutors to charge someone with murder, manslaughter or battery for intentionally harming a fetus. Under the law, when a pregnant woman is attacked, prosecutors can charge the assailant with a crime against the woman and a separate crime against the baby, but the law excludes abortion. It is not clear how long the couple had been dating but Abbott, who has two sons from a previous relationship, divorced just over a year earlier, according to records. She is listed as a witness in the complaint, along with Kansas Bureau of Investigation agents, registered nurses and bank and post office workers. Trego County Sheriff Richard Hanks confirmed that Abbott is an employee in his office so although the crime allegedly occurred there, it is being dealt with by a neighboring county, Hays.","Scott Bollig, from Wakeeney, Kansas, 'crushed up an anti-abortion drug and served it to his girlfriend who was eight to ten weeks pregnant'

A young mother says she is blessed to be raising her baby daughter after enduring treatment for a rare condition which she was told could leave her infertile. Holly Hampshire, 31, of Huddersfield, was diagnosed with Wegener's Granulomatosis - a type of vasculitis - after she was admitted to hospital with severe flu-like symptoms. As medics struggled to stabilise her, Mrs Hampshire required steroids and medication to suppress her immune system as well as chemotherapy which she was warned could leave her unable to conceive children. Welcome addition: Holly and James feel blessed to be raising their baby daughter after she was diagnosed with Wegener's Granulomatosis . Support: Holly said she couldn't have managed without James following her diagnosis . At first she didn't realise how serious her condition was and didn't want to bother doctors because she thought she just had the flu. She said: 'At first they were classic flu-like symptoms - an achy neck, a persistent headache and a runny nose. I was constantly tired. 'I was dedicated to work so the idea of taking time off was unthinkable. Besides, I thought the symptoms would clear up on their own. I resisted going to see a doctor because I thought I'd be laughed out of the waiting room.' But her partner James and colleagues at the radio station where she worked, seeing her struggle urged her to seek medical help when her symptoms worsened. Treatment: Holly during one of her hospital stays . She said: 'My appetite completely disappeared, which is unusual because I like my food. I was sleeping more and more, and when I blew my nose there was quite a lot of blood. 'I would go to bed telling James that I hoped I would feel better, but there was never any improvement. 'When the advisor at NHS Direct heard I had been coughing up blood, she explained that I should go to seek help immediately.' Ordeal: Her condition rapidly deteriorated and soon she was critically ill in hospital . She was initially diagnosed with tracheitis - inflammation of the windpipe - but two days into a course of antibiotics her condition continued to deteriorate and James took her directly to A&E. There, doctors ordered blood tests which returned abnormal results and gave her a chest x-ray which revealed lesions in her lungs. She said: 'I had some hearing loss and my gum tissue started falling away, so that I could see more and more of my teeth. Red, gritty material was coming from my eyes and I struggled to stay conscious. 'My mum arrived on the ward, took one look at me, and started demanding clear answers from the consultants. A lot of different ideas had been mentioned - that it was pneumonia or cancer - but nothing was clear.' She underwent a nasal biopsy which confirmed Wegenerâ€™s Granulomatosis - a rare incurable condition which causes inflammation of the blood vessels and turns the immune system against itself. She said: 'My vital signs dropped during the biopsy. I remember one of the doctors leaning over and telling me that the crash team were on standby - I thought, ""oh my God, what's going on?"" 'Wegener's Granulomatosis is usually associated with elderly people - it was quite rare for a 26-year-old to be diagnosed with it.' Following the diagnosis, Holly was prescribed steroids and medication to suppress her immune . system, and warned that she would need chemotherapy, which can leave . patients infertile. The . news was a devastating blow as she and James,  36, an export . manager, had planned to start a family after their wedding the following winter. She . said: 'James and I really wanted children. After a lot of . soul-searching I chose not to start chemotherapy straight away because I . knew it could make me infertile, and just hoped the other medication . would make me feel better.' Despite . the limited effects of the drugs, she was able to return home . for Christmas, on the condition she returned to hospital for . twice-weekly checkups. By the time she was discharged, she had been in . hospital for two and a half weeks. She . recalled: 'James probably had it the hardest of all. He had to watch me . as I was very ill. Emotions were running high at the time, particularly . when I heard I wouldn't be able to have children. I didn't know how . much better I was going to get. 'I suggested it might be best if we . didn't get married. But James was adamant - he wanted to stay close to . me as we got through the difficult times together. I couldnâ€™t have . managed without him.' Wedding bells: Holly, who underwent her last chemotherapy session just a week before her wedding to James, says the day was all the more poignant because of what they were going through . Holly started chemotherapy in May and underwent her last session . just a week before the couple's wedding in September 2009. She . said: 'I'd experienced hair loss and my face had swelled due to the . steroids. I was weak, but it was still the most fabulous day. It was all . the more poignant because of what we were going through.' Despite the odds stacked against them the couple began trying for a baby 18 months after their wedding. Holly said: 'I was taken off a course of medication which had . prevented us from trying. We thought we had nothing to lose and, nearly . two years to the day after we married, I fell pregnant. It was wonderful . when we found out.' In May 2012, the couple's daughter, Robyn, was born. Holly said: 'As I held Robyn after she was born I felt as if I . already knew her. I delivered her a little bit early on medical advice, . because my symptoms had flared up, but everything I went through during . the pregnancy was worth it.' She said: 'She's very sociable and has a cracking personality. She looks like James and is quite decisive, like me.' Miracle baby: Holly and her daughter Robyn, now 20 months old . Since her diagnosis, Holly has become a trustee of Vasculitis UK, a charity which supports research into the diagnosis and treatment of vasculitis, and has launched a support group for patients in Yorkshire. She said: 'This experience has made me change my life. If I think back to the 26-year-old I was, my life is completely different now. I've had to make some big adaptations, but that doesn't mean I'm unhappy with the life I have - I'm very happy. 'The disease is incurable. I know it's something I'll have to cope with for the rest of my life, but I feel like I can get through it with my family. The challenges we face won't break us.'

Two police officers who spent weeks competing to see who could take the most cardboard signs away from homeless people have escaped with just a three day suspension for the cruel prank. The action was finally taken nearly two months after the Midland Police Department learned of the 'game',according to findings of the internal affairs investigation obtained by The Associated Press through a public records request. Advocate groups immediately blasted the department's handling, suggesting that the punishment wasn't harsh enough and that the probe should have been made public much earlier, before news organizations started asking about it. Taking from the poor: Two police officers in Midland, Texas were briefly suspended for playing a game in which they confiscated signs from homeless people. Above, one of the stolen signs . 'The fact that they are making sport out of collecting the personal property of homeless individuals could be seen as them targeting these individuals for discriminatory harassment,' said Cassandra Champion, an attorney in the Odessa office of the Texas Civil Rights Project. 'Simply holding a sign is absolutely a protected part of our free speech.' Police Chief Price Robinson said the actions were an isolated incident in a department of 186 officers and didn't deserve a harsher punishment. After the investigation all officers were reminded to respect individual rights and human dignity, he said. 'We want to respect people, no matter . who they are â€” homeless, whatever,' Robinson said. 'That situation's . been dealt with. Those officers understand.' The . investigation found the two officers, Derek Hester and Daniel Zoelzer, . violated the department's professional standards of conduct. There is no . law against panhandling in Midland, an oil-boom city of more than . 110,000 where a recent count put the homeless number at about 300. About a quarter of those are transient. 'I think i was set up': A text message conversation obtained by the Associated Press shows the police officers talking about the game after getting caught by their superiors in the department . Evan Rogers, founder of Church Under the Bridge Midland's ministry, said the failure by police to disclose the officers' behavior once discovered made it appear the department was 'pushing it under the carpet. 'I think that does give the public the wrong message,' he said. Asked Wednesday about why the investigation wasn't made public earlier, city spokeswoman Sara Higgins said it is not the department's standard protocol to announce when an internal affairs investigation is completed. She said the officers weren't suspended until January because of staffing issues and the winter holidays. On a recent afternoon, one group of homeless people could be seen near a trash bin behind a fast-food restaurant and another around an intersection.  Among their signs was one that read: 'Anything helps. God bless.' No right: Midland police officers Derek Hester and Daniel Zoelzer confiscated the signs even though panhandling isn't against the law Midland. Above, a homeless woman named Katt in Midland . Targeted: The homeless population in Midland is about 300, a quarter of whom are transient. From left, Joseph Johnson, Desarie Caine and Ronald King take a break from panhandling on February 24 . 'If it was them, I guarantee you they'd be doing the same thing,' said Desarie Caine, who sought donations on a street corner while eating from a package of beef jerky. 'I think they're bored.' The two officers, who did not appeal their suspensions, have been with the department about two years. They both returned emails from the AP declining to be interviewed. According to the investigation report, . eight signs were found in the trunk of Hester's patrol car on Nov. 20 . and Zoelzer had thrown the about 10 signs he had confiscated into a city . trash container after Hester called him to warn him he had been . reprimanded by his superior for having the signs. The . two told the internal affairs investigator, that they were issuing . criminal trespass warnings when they took the signs. But according to . the report, no homeless people were issued criminal trespass warnings by . either officer in 2013. Most of those warnings in Midland are written, . but some are verbal. Some punishment: The two officers were put on suspension for three days without pay two months after the department found out about the game. Above, another of the confiscated signs . Desperate: Homeless man Joseph Johnson holds up a sign while asking motorists for donations in Midland, Texas on February 24 . The investigation also looked into complaints from within the department that Hester and Zoelzer failed to log into evidence brass knuckles, a small set of scales and two knives they had obtained during other patrol stops. The investigation into the signs began after an officer on patrol with Hester when Hester obtained the brass knuckles sent an email to his sergeant Nov. 18 about Hester saying he wasn't going to log them in as evidence. The signs and the brass knuckles were found in Hester's car during a vehicle inspection two days later. The contest between Hester, 25, and Zoelzer, 26, was alluded to in text messages on November 21 obtained by the AP. It was unclear which of the officers sent each message. 'My bad man when he first ask me about it he didn't seem mad or anything so I just told him me and u wereaking (sic) a game outta it when we'd trespass them and stuff,' one text read. Another read, 'Man this is some bs.' Although Rogers said he doesn't believe the officers' actions reflect on the whole department, he considered the penalty insufficient. 'I don't believe three days gives it justice,' Rogers said.","Midland Police Officers Derek Hester, 25, and Daniel Zoelzer, 26, were suspended for three days without pay two months after being found out .

An FBI source who met with Osama bin Laden in 1993 was later killed by al Qaeda operatives who suspected his dissent . An FBI mole who met with Osama bin Laden was later killed by al Qaeda who suspected he was a U.S. informant. At the time of his death in Bosnia around 1994 or 1995, the mole, who was originally from Sudan, had been working for the CIA after being tempted by a large amount of money. The existence of the mole and his close contact with bin Laden came to light in newly-released court documents. Intel from the meeting between the informant and bin Laden led to the FBI thwarting a terrorist attack . on a British cruise liner and another on a masonic lodge in Los Angeles. According to NBC News, the FBI recruited the mole in 1993 when he was the driver and close confidant of the 'blind sheik' Omar Abdel-Rahman - the mastermind behind the 1993 World Trade Center attack. In early 1993, after being tipped off by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the FBI found the Sudanese driver on a terrorism watch list. Following the 1993 attack on the World Trade Center - where explosives detonated in an underground parking garage killing six people -  the FBI began to watch the Sheikh, who was living in Los Angeles, but needed a way to get closer. After failed attempts to deport the driver, the FBI turned him into a source using Bassem Youssef, a high-ranking agent and Arabic speaker. Youssef initally approached the Sudanese driver under the guise of a friend who could help reunite him with his family, according to the NBC report. Soon the FBI had tapped the phones in the driver's home and were working on his wife to have her cooperate. Scroll down for video . Working back-channels: The revelations came as part of a discrimination suit filed by FBI agent Bassem Youssef (pictured) who cultivated the source that got in direct contact with bin Laden . When the driver learned the truth, he decided to cooperate and began providing information on a group known as al Qaeda. The mole provided authentic U.S. and Canadian passports where the pictures had been cut out and replaced with al Qaeda members, allowing them to travel freely. The FBI informant was also able to arrange a meeting in 1993 with a shadowy, little-known terrorist called Osama bin Laden. According to NBC, the mole told the FBI that the blind sheikh said: 'If you need any money, you go to Osama directly and tell him I sent you.' The informant's crucial information sparked the interest of the CIA who convinced the Sudanese driver to come work with them for financial reward. Around 1994, the mole was sent to Bosnia to gain information on al Qaeda operatives who were supporting Bosnia's Muslim majority against the Serbs. Leader: The source was close with 'blind Sheik' Omar Abdel-Rahman, the al Qaeda official who was behind the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center . His handler Youssef had no idea what had happened to the driver. Later, the FBI agent, who had gone undercover among terrorists cells in LA, found out that al Qaeda had killed the driver because they believed him to be a CIA mole. The previously-unknown meeting between an FBI mole and bin Laden came to . light when Youssef filed a . discrimination lawsuit against the agency. The Washington Times reported that former FBI official Edward Curran testified on Youssef's behalf in the 2010 case and told of the agent's successes at the bureau. News of the FBI's source . meeting with bin Laden comes in direct contrast to previous testimony . that was used as the 'accepted' timeline of events leading up to the . 9/11 attacks. The 9/11 . Commission Report described the FBI's intelligence on bin Laden at the . time as being 'at best cloudy' and made no mention of a source who had . direct contact with the terrorist. The former head of the 9/11 Commission . argues that the source was not directly related to the plot against the . World Trade Center as his information came six years earlier. Youssef filed a discrimination suit against the bureau saying that he was sidelined after September 11 because his colleagues assumed he was an Arab Muslim. The highly-decorated agent is a Coptic Christian. Youssef continues to work for the FBI while pursuing his discrimination case.","An al Qaeda insider turned FBI mole 'met with bin Laden in the early Nineties'

A 20-year-old man has been sentenced to three years in prison for sexually assaulting his younger stepsister in Madison, Wisconsin . A 20-year-old man has been sentenced to three years in prison for sexually assaulting his younger stepsister while she spent years locked in the family's Madison, Wisconsin, basement being abused and starved. Dane County Circuit Judge Julie Genovese also gave the man an additional two years for sexually assaulting his then-15-year-old girlfriend in 2011. The sentences will run consecutively. The sentences come about eight months after Genovese sentenced him to 15 months in prison for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girlfriend in 2011. He got credit for time served in jail in his stepsister's case and didn't have to spend any time in prison, though. Assistant District Attorney Matthew Moeser asked the judge to give the man a combined 30 years in prison in the two pending cases, describing him as a conniving sexual predator. ‘He has a pattern of sexual offenses that are unrivaled at his age,’ Moeser said. ‘He is a dangerous person who seems to have no ability to stop lying, stop manipulating.’ The man's attorney, Ronald Benavides, pleaded for leniency. He contended the offenses took place when his client was a teenager, he had been in a relationship with his former girlfriend for seven months, everyone lies and the man grew up in a home with ‘socially bizarre norms.’ The man gave a rambling 40-minute speech to the judge, pleading with her for another chance. He said he'll be punished for the rest of his life because he'll have to register as a sex offender and won't be able to have contact with minors. ‘Thank God,’ his ex-girlfriend's father whispered from the courtroom gallery's front row, where he watched the proceedings along with his daughter. Genovese sentenced the stepmother, left, to five years after she pleaded no contest to reckless endangerment, while the girl's father, right, was ultimately convicted of child neglect and reckless endangerment . ‘I need counseling,’ the man told Genovese. ‘I need someone to talk to. I need help... (30 years) says, “oh, yeah, you were a victim but we don’t care.”’ Genovese acknowledged that the defendant was a teenager when he committed his crimes, adding that most teenage sexual contact isn't prosecuted. His home was marked by ‘serious dysfunction’ and he developed a flawed character from living in it, she added. But she told the man he still skates through life by lying and the seriousness of his offenses demand prison time. ‘You haven't quite gotten that societal rules apply to you,’ she said. The Associated Press generally doesn't publish the names of sex crime victims and isn't naming family members to avoid identifying the two girls. The man's offenses came to light in February 2012 when his stepsister ran away from her family's Madison home. A passing motorist noticed her on the streets, barefoot and wearing only light pajamas. Doctors said the 15-year-old girl weighed just 68 pounds; the motorist who found her said she was so small he mistook her for an 8-year-old. The girl told investigators that her stepmother and father had kept her in the basement with boarded up windows, motion sensors and an alarm on the basement door for most of the previous five years and didn't give her enough food. She said her stepmother beat her and her stepbrother tried to have sex with her when she was nine years old, forced her to perform oral sex on him in 2009 and hit her. Genovese sentenced the stepmother to five years in prison last summer after the woman pleaded no contest to reckless endangerment and causing mental harm to a child. The girl's father went through two trials and was ultimately convicted of child neglect, child abuse, reckless endangerment and causing mental harm to a child. He told the judge during his sentencing hearing the girl suffered from severe emotional and behavioral problems that he couldn't handle and that his trucking job kept him away from home and he didn't notice how thin she had become; Genovese gave him five years, too. The stepbrother pleaded guilty in July to repeated sexual assault of a child in the case involving his former girlfriend. A jury found him guilty this month of first- and second-degree sexual assault of a child and child abuse in his stepsister's case. ‘As you can see, my step-brother... was very rotten to me,’ the girl, who is now in foster care, wrote in a letter to Genovese this week. ‘I do not want to see (him) ever again.’","The man, 20, was sentenced to Wednesday to  three years for sexually .

The teen mom accused of abandoning her newborn in a dumpster says she thought the boy was dead when she threw him out with the trash, a Child Protective Services caseworker said in Houston yesterday. The caseworker testified in an emergency custody hearing that the 16-year-old didn't even know she was pregnant when she went into labor and gave birth in her apartment bathtub. After giving birth, the teen cut the boy's umbilical cord herself but thought her son was dead so placed him in the dumpster. Resilient: Child protective services was granted temporary custody Wednesday of a newborn found alive in a Houston dumpster Tuesday morning. The mother has been identified as a 16-year-old who says she didn't know she was pregnant . Namesake: The baby boy was found my maintenance worker Carlos Michel (pictured). The mother decided to name the child after him . Apparently the teen's mother lives in Alvin, but she had been staying with her aunt while attending South Houston High School. She says she has not spoken to her son's 22-year-old father in about six months. A judge awarded CPS temporary custody of the child, but said she would allow the mother to visit the newborn if the attorney assigned to represent the baby agrees. The caseworker asked the mom if she wanted to name her son, and she chose Carlos after the man who found the baby and saved his life. The boy was found Tuesday morning at the Reserve Apartments by maintenance worker Carlos Michel, who heard what sounded like cat mewing coming from the dumpster. Sad discovery: The baby was found stuffed in a trash bag among food containers, scraps and school homework . He investigated further and found the baby boy alive, stuffed in a white trash bag along with food containers, scraps and school homework. Michel and another man took the baby to a nearby car to keep it warm while they waited for police and paramedics to arrive. The boy was found purple and having a hard time breathing but was in good condition at Memorial Hermann Hospital yesterday. The mother was also taken to the hospital for examination after being identified. Once released she will be questioned by police, who will then decide whether to bring up charges. Strange noises: Maintenance worker Carlos Michel discovered the baby after hearing what sounded like a cat mewing coming from the dumpster . Both were still in the hospital as of Wednesday night, according to the Houston Chronicle. Adding to the tragedy is the fact that Texas has a special law to help new mothers who can't take care of their children. The Baby Moses law states that a babies up to 60-days-old can be dropped off without fear of prosecution at any hospital, fire station or ambulance station - as long as the baby is handed off to a person. CPS is currently trying to figure out if there are any other family members who can look after the boy when he gets out of the hospital, or if he'll need to be placed in the foster care system.","A maintenance worker found the baby alive after hearing cat mewing sounds coming from the dumpster Tuesday morning .

Plans for a sick teenage girl caught in a custody battle with doctors to be placed in foster care have been put on hold. A judge's decision on Monday to place 15-year-old Justina Pelletier in foster care and not be returned to her family caused her mother Linda to faint at the Boston courthouse. The 56-year-old, who is diabetic, was stretchered out and taken to Massachusetts General Hospital. However, for the time being, Justina will now remain at Wayside Youth & Family Support Network in Framingham. Scroll down for video . Linda Pelletier was taken to Massachusetts General Hospital on Monday , accompanied by her daughter Jennifer, after she collapsed on finding out that her sick daughter Justina will remain in foster care . Desperate: Justina Pelletier, 15, pictured with her mom Linda, has now spent a year in a psychiatric ward after she was taken from her parents against their will on doctor's orders . Family representative Patrick J Mahoney, director of the Christian Defense Coalition, said 'she is going to be, for now, sataying at Wayside', according to Courant.com. Speaking from her Connecticut home following her collapse, Linda Pelletier told MailOnline that doctors said her blackout . was caused by the high stress she has been suffering over her daughter's . ordeal, which the mother described as 'evil'. Mrs Pelletier said: 'I ask my husband every day, ''Are they trying to kill her?''' Mrs Pelletier and husband Lou have been battling Boston Children's Hospital and the Massachusetts Department of Children and Families to regain custody of their once vibrant daughter Justina since February 2013. Justina . Pelletier was diagnosed with . Mitochondrial Disease, a rare genetic muscle-wasting illness, by Tufts . Medical Center in 2011 and was undergoing a drug treatment program. However last year, while being treated for flu at Boston's Children’s . Hospital, experts said she had Somatoform Disorder, a stress-related mental . illness where people 'imagine they are ill'. When the teen's parents contested the hospital's diagnosis and sought to have their daughter treated by her own doctor, officials reportedly refused and a short time later, the girl was taken into the custody of the state. The teenager was transferred to a residential psychiatric unit at the end of January 2013 and has remained there since. Mrs Pelletier, who has three other daughters and cares for her 93-year-old mother at West Hartford home, told MailOnline on Tuesday: 'I have had no medical updates about my child. She is deteriorating - she can't stand, sit, she has chronic pain. 'When I saw her on Friday, her stomach was distended, she didn't feel well. But nobody helps her.' Massachusetts Department of Children and Families said in a statement: 'The Department of Children and Families does not comment or provide any information regarding children in our custody. Additionally, the Court has maintained a gag order in this case, prohibiting any parties from discussing the case or details surrounding it.' Wayside Youth residential unit in Framingham where Miss Pelletier is currently being held was unable to comment on specific cases. Anguish: Justina Pelletier's mother Linda and sister Jennifer are rushed to a waiting ambulance after the 56-year-old collapsed following the judge's ruling that her daughter will be kept in foster care . Happy: The family maintain that Justina was healthy and contented before she was admitted to hospital a year ago. They said she was a keen ice-skater and loved hiking with her dog Roxie (right) The family was devastated that Justina is was scheduled to . be moved from the residential center in Framingham to Shore Educational . Collaborative which is even further from the family's home in West . Hartford, Connecticut, and makes it more difficult to visit. A gag order remains in place over the custody proceedings until the next court date on March 17. Mrs Pelletier said on Tuesday that she has no faith in the justice system since her daughter was taken from her family, calling the court hearings a 'joke'. However the mother-of-four said her family was now being helped by several lawyers and organizations. She said: 'I'm so grateful, they have given me hope. I feel like God has finally listened.' Fears: Lou and Linda say Justina 'is barely recognizable as her health has deteriorated so badly' We miss you: Sitting on Justina's bed at her Connecticut home are her sisters: From left, Julia, Jennifer and Jessica. Jessica, far right, has been diagnosed as having the same Mitochondrial Disease that Justina was being treated for before she was 'kidnapped' after a visit to Boston Children's Hospital with a bout of the flu . Mr Pelletier told MailOnline last month that his daughter's health had declined drastically. He said: 'Her legs are paralyzed, she has no upper body strength and she is in constant pain because they have removed most of her medications. Justina Pelletier was diagnosed with . mitochondrial disease in 2011, a genetic condition that . affects muscle coordination and mobility. There is no cure for the condition that is progressive and can be fatal. Symptoms can include weakness, intolerance for exercise, heart failure, dementia and rhythm disturbances. Each year, 1,000-4,000 children in the U.S. are born with the disease. However last year doctors concluded Miss Pellietier was suffering from Somafotorm disorder, a . psychological condition that causes sufferers to feel pain, although . there is no physical cause for it. Sufferers do not feign the physical symptoms they feel, rather they present themselves as the result of mental strain. Doctors cannot identify the sources of patients' pain and instead prescribe anti-depressants. Experts . estimate that between 0.2 and 2 per cent of females and less than 0.2. per cent of men in the US suffer from the condition. 'She suffered a stroke when she was seven and it affected her short-term memory. She is considered learning disabled, yet she has had no education in the last year. 'Justina did manage to sneak a few notes out of the hospital but she can’t do that anymore. She has forgotten how to write and spell. 'From what we can gather, she spends 24 hours a day lying in a room. It is a locked psychiatric unit full of children with major psychiatric problems. 'Justina doesn’t have psychiatric problems, she is ill and she needs proper medical care. Once a week she is taken on a three-hour round trip to see doctors but that is it. 'We are only allowed to see her for one hour a week at a Department of Children and Families office. Health aside, she is a mess. 'She’s in a wheelchair yet she is . getting no help with showering or grooming. When we saw her last it was . 20 degrees outside and her hair was wet.' Boston Children's Hospital have rarely commented on the case, but in a statement to MailOnline they said they were 'proud' of their work and the 'positive impact on the patient'. The hospital did not address the family's specific allegations. Boston Children’s Hospital said in a statement: 'Boston Children’s would like to acknowledge the tremendous efforts of our staff in caring for this patient. We are proud of their work and positive impact on the patient. 'Boston Children’s and our clinicians are particularly distressed that the inaccuracies surrounding this case have caused undue concern for the many children and their families with Mitochondrial Disorders in our care.'","Judge ruled on Monday that Justina Pelletier, 15, to be placed in foster care after being locked in a psychiatric ward a year ago against family's wishes .

A court in Florida has heard how a 31-year-old American woman was found 'painted in blood from head to toe' after being beaten and raped by a cabin steward on a Holland America cruise ship. Prosecutors allege witnesses saw the passenger who was only identified in court by initials, covered in blood, after a savage and brutal beating by Ketut . Pujayasa, a room service attendant on the Nieuw Amsterdam. Pujayasa claims he . attacked the 31-year-old because she insulted his family when he tried . to deliver her breakfast on Valentine's Day. The vicious assault on the woman only came to a halt when passengers, who heard the commotion inside the stateroom, began banging on the door. The Indonesian cabin attendant has been denied bail after prosecutors told a federal judge that he admitted to raping and beating the lady during a nude cruise, before trying to throw her . overboard. The 28-year-old cruise ship worker told the FBI he used a master key to break into the passenger's room at night time, and attacked her in her bed. The ships' doctor, a 40-year veteran emergency room physician, told FBI agents that the woman was so severely injured he thought she might die. 'In his 40 years, he had not seen such a violent attack,' Assistant U.S. Attorney Francis Viamontes said. 'Every witness who saw her said she was completely covered in blood.' The woman, who was on a Bare Necessities nudist cruise, was saved after a fellow passenger pounded on her guestroom door, allegedly scaring off Pujayasa who claims to have jumped to a lower balcony to escape. FBI agent David Nunez testified that Pujayasa, a room service attendant on the ship, confessed to his roommate and gave to a statement to authorities. Pujayasa allegedly told police he decided to attack the woman, who has not been named, after she told him: 'Wait a minute, son of a b****' when he knocked on her door with her breakfast. 'Pujayasa stated that the passenger's . comment of ""son of a bitch"" was offensive to himself and his parents. He . was angry and upset the rest of the day. He interpreted the comment as an insult to his family and sought revenge. Pujayasa told the agents that he was accustomed to personal insults and verbal abuse from rude passengers but lost it over what he said was an insult to his family. 'He made that point over and over again, that it wasn't about insulting him, it was about insulting his family â€” especially his mother,' Agent Nunez said. Prosecutors said they have a wealth of other evidence â€” including his confession and pending DNA test results they expect will confirm he was the attacker. Pujayasa, who is married and lived with his wife, parents and three siblings in Indonesia, had no prior criminal history in the U.S. or his native country, officials said. Scroll down for video . Specialist tour: The passenger was on a Bare Necessities tour, which caters to nudist travelers . The steward had considered hitting . the woman when he spotted her on a deck later in the day, but decided it . was too crowded, he told police. He . allegedly used a master key to get in the passenger's room, and waited . on the balcony for the woman to return to her room that night, then hit . her with a laptop and tried to choke her with the cord from curling . tongs and a phone wire. His . victim fought back, biting him, striking at his exposed genitals and . using a corkscrew to try to stab him, Pujayasa reportedly told the FBI. He claimed that he wanted to throw the woman into the sea, while the ship was passing by Roatan, Honduras. The room, the balcony and the doors that lead to it were all smeared with blood, agents said. FBI agents said the woman, who is about 5 feet 6 inches tall and has a ""medium fit build,"" fought hard to defend herself, stabbing at her attacker with a corkscrew she managed to grab. She told them she bit the man's right hand when he put it in her mouth to try to stifle her screams for help, and agents said she left a visible bite mark on Pujayasa. As the woman fought back, passengers began pounding on her door trying to help her. The noise coming from outside the stateroom distracted the alleged assailant and the woman was able to flee her stateroom. After . her attacker was scared off, the victim fled to a hallway where a . fellow passenger found her covered in blood and wearing only a tank . top. Ordeal: The 31-year-old passenger had been vacationing on Holland America's cruise ship, Nieuw Amsterdam . 'The passenger also noted that [the . victim] had a curling iron wrapped and tangled around her neck and/or . hair. He also described [her] as having black eyes and visible bruising . around her neck and shoulders. '[The woman], fearing death was imminent, . asked the passenger to relay to her family how much she loved them,' the FBI report stated. The cruise ship docked in Honduras and the victim was airlifted to a Florida hospital. Security guards on the ship detained Pujayasa until they arrived in the Everglades on Sunday. The victim had been on an eight-day . cruise with nudist vacation specialists Bare Necessities, which took in . Jamaica, the Bahamas and Honduras on a voyage that left Florida on . February 9. As well as traveling to exotic . destinations, guests were able to take part in couples massage, Tantra . classes, a production of the Vagina Monologues and a Captain's party, according to the travel company's website. Guests on the cruises, which had been run previously on the Nieuw Amsterdam, are required to wear clothes only when the ship is in port, or when they are at dinner or attending the Captain's party. In a statement to Mail Online, Nancy Tiemann, the co-owner of Bare Necessities, said: 'We are deeply saddened by the incident that occurred on one of our cruise ship charters last week and are encouraged by reports that our passenger is recovering from her injuries.' 'Our hearts go out to our passenger and we stand ready to aid her in any way possible. It would be a disservice to our cruise guest to comment on what is a most difficult and disturbing incident,' she added. Clothes-free: Bare Necessities has run previous nudist tours on the cruise ship . Pujayasa has been charged with attempted murder and aggravated sexual abuse. Holland America has fired the employee, who had worked for the company since 2012. Agents said Pujayasa, who is 5 feet 2 inches tall and weighs 140 pounds, inflicted a horrific beating and sexual assault on the woman, a U.S. citizen identified only by her initials in court. He said he fell asleep on her balcony while waiting for her to return, remained hidden until she lay down and closed her eyes, then violently attacked her, agents said.

When comedian Laurie Kilmartin got the devastating news that her 83-year-old father was dying from lung cancer, she turned to humor – and social media - offering touching and wildly sarcastic updates on her dad's deteriorating condition. Kilmartin has been hard at work giving her rapidly growing number of followers the blow-by-blow account of her father's decline since February 22. But it was not until Wednesday that the Emmy-nominated satirist's live-tweeting has gone viral. Dark humor: Comedian Laurie Kilmartin (left) has been live-tweeting her cancer-stricken father's (center) passing . ‘Losing Dad, gaining followers. The Lord truly works in mysterious ways,’ the comic wrote to her 14,900 fans, and counting. After six rounds of chemotherapy and a week of radiation treatment, Korean War veteran Ron Kilmartin was admitted into a hospice facility February 20. Miss Kilmartin, a staff writer on TBS' 'Conan' best known for being a finalist on season 7 of Last Comic Standing, has been sharing with the world her experience of losing her father before her very eyes. Her tweets range from the deeply sarcastic to heart-breaking, from darkly funny to wistful and genuinely sweet. ‘It appears that Dad will die as he lived, covered by horrible crocheted blankets,’ she joked. On Monday, she wrote: 'First 2 days of Dad's hospice, I wouldn't leave the room w/o telling him ""I love you."" Now we're into day 5, I just say ""We're cool, right?”' Laughter through tears: Miss Kilmartin has been posting tweets filled with biting humor and sarcasm about her 83-year-old father (far left) No joke: The humorist shared this heart-rending photo of Mr Kilmartin with his wife of 55 years . In another message brilliantly mingling sadness and humor, Kilmartin said that her father indicated for the first time that his pain level was at a ’10,’ but she wryly remarked  ‘that could've been because we were watching The View.’ In one of the more heartfelt tweets on her account, Kilmartin shared: ‘Hard to leave Dad's side. I am drawn to him like a moth to a flame (that's about to go out).' Warrior: Ron Kilmartin served in the Korean War . While many of her followers, including . actor and comedian Patton Oswalt, have embraced Kilmartin's unique . approach to dealing with loss, others have criticized her for making . light of her father’s impending death. In a tongue-in-cheek post, Miss Kilmartin explained to her detractors what her ultimate goal is. 'Guys, I'm just trying to grieve in advance, so I can relax and have fun at the funeral,' she wrote. It was Mr Oswalt, a star of 'Young Adult' best known for his voiceover in Pixar's 'Ratatouille,' who put Miss Kilmartin's live-tweeting exercise on the map when he described it as 'epic' to his 1.6million followers Wednesday. User Bill Jensen raved: ‘If @anylaurie16 doesn't win a Pulitzer for her father's-deathbed tweets, the whole award system is a sham.’ The 140-character messages have allowed an unflinching look into Kilmartin's relationship with her octogenarian dad, including their political differences: Mr Kilmartin is a conservative and a big fan of Glenn Beck, while his daughter is a liberal. 'Dad just let me turn on MSNBC during a Fox News commercial break. Time for Last Rites,' Miss Kilmartin quipped this afternoon. Lost fight: Mr Kilmartin, pictured here with a grandson, was diagnosed with lung cancer and went through six rounds of chemotherapy and radiation treatment before being sent to a hospice facility . An hour earlier, she tweeted in the same . vain: 'How I check that I've put Dad's hearing aids in correctly. Whisper ""testing, testing, Obama is a Muslim,"" then look for the thumbs . up.' She went on: ‘Can't bear to see cancer devour my Dad. Gonna give him a heart attack instead by showing him how much $$$ I've donated to MoveOn .org.’ For the past two weeks, Mr Kilmartin has been in the care of his wife of 55 years, Miss Kilmartin and her sister, who is a doctor. Laurie Kilmartin also has been bringing her 7-year-old son to the hospice to spend time with his grandpa, and the boy has offered his own take on the situation. Pushing the envelope: Miss Kilmartin has been ribbing her dying dad about his ultra-conservative politics in wry tweets about Fox News and Obama . Viral sensation: Kilmartin, an Emmy Award-nominated writer on 'Conan', has drawn thousands of followers on Twitter after actor and comedian Patton Oswalt praised her updates about her father . ‘I said, ""Grandpa's dying,"" and my 7 yo son looked up at me with his big brown chocolate drop eyes and said, ""what about his iPad?""’ the comic tweeted. Miss Kilamrtin is not the first to live-tweet the passing of a parent.

A Manhattan apartment building has done away with front door keycards and replaced them with a facial recognition system that opens the security door after a resident glances into the camera.Knickerbocker Village is a housing development in the Lower East Side with 12 buildings and 1,600 apartments, making it difficult for the four guards on duty to monitor the comings and goings, even with the 128 surveillance cameras mounted around the buildings.So the complex's general manager, Vincent Callagy, decided to have the FST21 SafeRise system installed. Opening doors: Residents at Knickerbocker Village need only their own faces to enter the building . Say cheese: The cameras are designed to be vandal-resistant . Now, residents simply stroll in, looking at the camera and the front door unlocks before they break their stride. 'Our old system used to have a card. If you lose your card, we have to charge you for a new card. If you forget your card, you can't get in the building. It's kind of hard to forget your face,' Callagy told Fox 5. The FST21 SafeRise is the brainchild of former Israel Defense Forces Major General Aharon Farkash, who says the system works because it's so simple. Little village: The vast 1930s-era apartment project is home to about 4,000 people . No more keys: The system takes a series of measurements and stores them in a database . Residents are all entered into the system by having a series of photographs of themselves taken, as well as other body measurements and movements. After that, they simply walk through the front door. 'We donâ€™t do traditional face [scans],' Daniel Peled, vice president, sales and marketing told the New York Post. 'It is a fusion of identify technologies - one is facial recognition [but] there are behavior analytics and other items that are part of our patented technology.' Visitors will speak to a 'Digital Doorman' which will refer them to the intercom system for permission to enter from the building's residents, or to the security desk. The FST12 even has licence plate recognition that will identify non-resident cars, even if it's 'tailgating' a resident, and alert guards on duty.","Knickerbocker Village has implements facial recognition technology in place of keycards .

Concerns have been raised over a former San Diego state running back who left a training session at an NFL Scouting Combine on Sunday because God told him to. Adam Muema has reportedly not been in touch with his San Diego State coaches since he left the session and did not show up to a training camp, scheduled for after the combine. Muema, the fourth leading rusher in Aztecs history, missed the combine training session, which saw other running backs compete in drills at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, because he said the Lord told him he'd play for the Seattle Seahawks if he took it easy. He said it was his 'dream' to play for the Super Bowl-winning team. But he then failed to turn to an offseason 'training base' in Florida, according to U-T San Diego.

Hillary Clinton has praised the governor of Arizona after she vetoed a bill that would have let businesses refuse to serve gays and lesbians on grounds of religion. The former U.S. Secretary of State spoke to an audience at the University of Miami yesterday, and addressed an estimated audience of 6,100 people. Highlighting the issue, Mrs Clinton, 66, said that Republican governor Jan Brewer 'recognized that inclusive leadership is really what the 21st century is all about.' Hillary Clinton has applauded Arizona governor Jan Brewer's decision to veto the religious rights bill . She added that all countries, including the U.S., must allow 'full participation' for women. 'I believe strongly that the more we can get people to participate, to have a stake in the future, the better off we will all be,' she added. Students listening to the speech cheered when they heard Mrs Clinton's comments. Hillary Clinton (left) was welcomed by the University of Miami's President . Donna Shalala (right) and received a warm reception at her speech there . Ms Brewer vetoed Arizona's controversial religious rights bill, after facing a deadline to decide whether to sign it on Saturday. The controversial politician faced enormous pressure to veto the legislation, even from within her own Republican ranks after the bill set off a national furor over gay rights and religious freedom.' 'My agenda is to sign into law legislation that advances Arizona,' Ms Brewer said at a news conference. 'I call them like I seem them despite . the tears or the boos from the crowd.' Decision time: With the clock ticking for Arizona Governor Jan Brewer finally decided to veto controversial SB 1062 on Wednesday. Here, the governor is seen mid-veto in a photo she posted to Twitter . The governor said she gave the legislation careful deliberation in talking to her lawyers, citizens and lawmakers on both sides of the debate. The bill backed by Republicans in the Legislature was designed to give added protection from lawsuits to people who assert their religious beliefs in refusing service to gays. But opponents called it an open attack on gays that invited discrimination. Gay rights supporters were delighted when they heard the official news of the veto signing at a rally held in Phoenix yesterday. Gay rights supporters David Martinez, right, hugs Christopher Heinl, after they learn Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer has vetoed SB1062 . The bill has thrust Arizona into the national spotlight after both chambers of the state legislature approved it. As the days passed last week, more and more groups, politicians and average citizens weighed in against Senate Bill 1062. Many took to social media to criticize the bill, calling it an attack on gay and lesbian rights. Prominent Phoenix business groups said it would be another black eye for the state that saw a national backlash over its 2010 immigration-crackdown law, SB1070, and warned that businesses looking to expand into the state may not do so if bill became law. Facing pressure? Three Republicans who had voted for the bill last week quickly changed their minds and said in a letter to Brewer that while the intent of their vote 'was to create a shield for all citizens' religious liberties, the bill has been mischaracterized by its opponents as a sword for religious intolerance.' Here, the governor announces the veto at a Wednesday press event . Companies such as Apple Inc. and American Airlines and politicians including GOP Sen. John McCain and former Republican presidential nominee were among those who urged Brewer to veto the legislation. Brewer . was under intense pressure to veto the bill, including from three . Republicans who had voted for the bill last week. They said in a letter . to Brewer that while the intent of their vote 'was to create a shield . for all citizens' religious liberties, the bill has been . mischaracterized by its opponents as a sword for religious intolerance.' SB . 1062 allows people to claim their religious beliefs as a defense . against claims of discrimination. Backers cite a New Mexico Supreme . Court decision that allowed a gay couple to sue a photographer who . refused to document their wedding, even though the law that allowed that . suit doesn't exist in Arizona. Republican Sen. Steve Yarbrough called his proposal a First Amendment issue during a Senate debate. 'This . bill is not about allowing discrimination,' Yarbrough said. 'This bill . is about preventing discrimination against people who are clearly living . out their faith.' Celebration: Cheers erupted amid protestors of the bill after Brewer's announcement was made . Surprised? Many feared the outspoken and often controversial governor might sign the bill into law as she dragged her feet with the Saturday deadline to veto looming . Democrats said it was a veiled attempt to legally discriminate against gay people and could allow people to break nearly any law and cite religious freedom as a defense. 'The heart of this bill would allow for discrimination versus gays and lesbians,' said Sen. Steve Gallardo, D-Phoenix. 'You can't argue the fact that bill will invite discrimination. That's the point of this bill. It is.' The bill is similar to a proposal last year brought by Yarbrough but vetoed by Brewer, a Republican. That legislation also would have allowed people or religious groups to sue if they believed they might be subject to a government regulation that infringed on their religious rights. Yarbrough stripped that provision from the bill in the hopes Brewer will embrace the new version. Civil-liberties and secular groups countered that Yarbrough and the Center for Arizona Policy, a powerful social conservative group that backs anti-abortion and conservative Christian legislation in the state and is opposed to gay marriage, had sought to minimize concerns that last year's bill had far-reaching and hidden implications. Good business? The 2015 Super Bowl will proceed as planned in Glendale's University of Phoenix Stadium. Before the veto, NFL officials said the bill would put their decision to play in the state into question . Yarbrough called those worries 'unrealistic and unsupported hypotheticals' and said criminal laws will continue to be prosecuted by the courts. The Center for Arizona Policy argues the law is needed to protect against increasingly activist federal courts and simply clarifies existing state law. 'We see a growing hostility toward religion,' said Josh Kredit, legal counsel for the group. Similar religious-protection legislation has been introduced in Ohio, Mississippi, Idaho, South Dakota, Tennessee and Oklahoma, but Arizona's plan is the only one that has been passed by a state legislature. The efforts are stalled in Idaho, Ohio and Kansas. The push in Arizona comes as an increasing number of conservative states grapple with ways to counter the growing legality of gay marriage. Arizona's voters approved a ban on gay marriage as a state constitutional amendment in 2008.

Miranda Kerr’s mother Therese has denied a falling out with her supermodel daughter, insisting it is time to follow her own dreams instead of living life vicariously through Miranda. Responding to claims the pair had a rift following Therese’s decision to quit as chief executive officer of Miranda’s cosmetic brand Kora, the 48-year-old said she had simply decided to step out of Miranda’s shadow. Scroll down for video . No worries: Supermodel Miranda Kerr (right) and her mother Therese have denied claims they have had a falling out, with Therese saying she just wants to step out of her daughter's shadow. The pair are pictured at the David Jones Spring/Summer 2009 Fashion Show in Sydney . ‘As a mum, I have lived a lot of dreams through Miranda,’ she told the Australian Women's Weekly. ‘There’s no right or wrong in that. But health and wellness is my passion. Now I am going to follow my own dream.' After leaving Kora, Therese has started to set up her own range of beauty products – a move that many believed was done so the mother and daughter would be business competitors. But she rejected the claims, saying the two brands were complementary to each other. ‘I would never do anything to compete with her because that’s just not who we are as a family…Miranda was so supportive of me bringing this out,’ she said. Belle of the ball: The supermodel at H&M's Paris Fashion Week party on Wednesday night . Therese took the reins of Kora in 2010, while Miranda was strutting her stuff on the catwalk as a Victoria’s Secret model. While she was CEO, the business grew from a small enterprise to a medium-sized one that sells products to 67 countries. Her new beauty range, which she has called Divine, will supply everyday products, such as hand sanitisers, deodorants and shampoo, and be lower in price to Kora to target a broader market. All smiles: Miranda Kerr (left) and her mother Therese will each have their own business to look after soon, with Therese working on starting a personal care range now . The comments come a few weeks after the Kerr family spoke about how much they missed Miranda and her three-year-old son Flynn, who she had with ex-husband Orlando Bloom, on ABC TV program Family Confidential. During the interview, Miranda’s father admitted he wishes his daughter wasn’t famous and wanted to give their grandson a taste of rural Australian life away from the paparazzi in Manhattan. But Therese rejected claims the interview was an impassioned plea for her daughter to come home. ‘The show wasn’t intended to be and we believe wasn’t about our darling Randa, who we adore and love with all our hearts. It was about Nan and Pa, my mum, our beautiful family – our roots,' she said. 'In the section where we talk about Randa’s success, we were simply being raw and honest in relation to our lives and to our family, and the impact of that success.'","Miranda Kerr's mother Therese insists the pair did not have a falling out .

"Fresh from his tirade in the New York magazine about how much he hates media scrutiny . By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 10:18 EST, 26 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 21:49 EST, 26 February 2014 . Hypocrite? Alec Baldwin will play a journalist in an episode of Law & Order: SVU airing March 19; despite his rants against the media . Media-loathing Alec Baldwin accepted the role of a journalist in an episode of the hit series, Law & Order: SVU. The actor, 55, who just days ago ranted in New York magazine about how much he . hates the media, portrays a newspaper columnist on the show which airs on NBC; the network that hosted his hit show 30 Rock and has felt the rough end of the Baldwin tongue frequently. Baldwin will play Jimmy McArthur, 'who questions the SVU squad’s . motives' during the investigation  hate crime-rape investigation, according to NBC. Criminal Stories will be shown on March 19; directed by the series' star Mariska . Hargitay. The brunette remarked upon Baldwin’s 'fierce . commitment.' Baldwin's MSNBC chat show was axed in November after . he allegedly called a photographer outside his Manhattan home 'a . c**ks*king f*g' , though he insists he called him a 'c*ks*ker.' In . New York magazine, Baldwin said former MSNBC colleague Joe . Scarborough 'neither eloquent nor funny' and described host Rachel Maddow . as 'a phony who doesn’t have the same passion for the truth off-camera . that she seems to have on the air.' He . also laid into CNN’s Anderson Cooper as 'the self-appointed Jack Valenti . of gay media culture,' name-checking the late head of the Motion Picture . Association of America. 'I give up': Melodramatic Alec laments his A-list life as he . predicts he will 'probably' have to leave New York due to media scrutiny but oddly suggests a move to L.A; America's showbiz media hub . Revealing: The interview also detail the former 30 Rock star's . feud with fellow actor Shia LaBeouf and the dispute with MSNBC that . ended his short-lived Up Late talk show . In the same interview, Mr Baldwin also claims Shia LaBeouf verbally attacked him while making Orphans, leading to their bust-up. The . star and Mr LaBeouf were engulfed in a feud after clashing while . making the Broadway play partly because he claims the Transformers actor . 'began to sulk' because Mr Baldwin didn't learn his lines ahead of . rehearsals. He said: 'One day he attacked me in front of . everyone. He said, “You’re slowing me down, and you don’t know your . lines. And if you don’t say your lines, I’m just going to keep saying my . lines.” 'We all sat, . frozen. I snorted a bit, and, turning to him in front of the whole cast, . I asked, “If I don’t say my words fast enough, you’re going to just say . your next line?” I said. “You realise the lines are written in a . certain order?” He just glared at me.' Mr Baldwin claims he asked for a break to cut short the incident and went to speak . to the stage manager with director Dan Sullivan and offered to quit the . project and insisted they didn't fire Mr Labeouf. But . the actor recalls Mr LaBeouf, who he had heard was 'potentially very . difficult to work with', was 'shocked' when he was given his marching . orders from the show. Love-hate . relationship: The volatile star has long lamented the intrusion into . his private life and several homophobic rants have notably affected his . career, with his short-lived Up Late talk show cancelled in November . following an anti-gay slur at a photographer . Getting to it: While Alec claims he wants to move he seemed quite happy to be in New York with his wife Hilaria on Wednesday . Elsewhere in the article, which features an accompanying close-up of Mr Baldwin as he . stares into the camera with a neutral, if . a little sour, expression on his face, the Oscar-nominee discusses his . feelings about MSNBC, on which he had short-lived talk show Up Late. The programme was pulled off air for good in November after five episodes . following what was initially a two-week suspension. While the official word was that the two . parted ways mutually, sources say the star's 'diva-like behaviour . towards co-workers', along with the homophobic comment, played a . deciding factor in the decision. But . in his New York magazine chat, he insists he 'never wanted' to be on . MSNBC in the first place and describes it as 'the same s**t all day . long' as well as slamming several stars of the channel including talk . show host Joe Scarborough. Leading the way: The star made a bee line for his car as Hilaria was a few steps behind . All bundled up: The mother-of-one looked to be in a relaxed mood on the outing . Speaking about the channel, he said: 'Morning Joe was boring. Scarborough is neither eloquent nor funny. And merely cranky doesn’t always work well in the morning. Mika B. is the Margaret Dumont of cable news. I liked Chris Jansing a lot. Very straightforward. I like Lawrence O’Donnell, but he’s too smart to be doing that show. Rachel Maddow is Rachel Maddow, the ultimate wonk/dweeb who got a show, polished it, made it her own. She’s talented. The problem with everybody on MSNBC is none of them are funny, although that doesn’t prevent them from trying to be.' However, Ms Maddow - who he described as 'phony who doesn't have the same passion for truth off-camera that she seems to have on air - seems to have dismissed his claims, highlighting that they have never even met. She tweeted: 'I have never met Mr. Baldwin, either on-camera or off-camera. I wish him all the best.' Around the same time the Up Late talk . show was pulled, Baldwin lamented the invasion of privacy he and his . family faces on a daily basis, ranting in an open letter on the Huffington Post that he was willing to give it all up to protect his loved ones. 'If . quitting the television business, the movie business, the theater, any . component of entertainment, is necessary in order to bring safety and . peace to my family, then that is an easy choice,' he wrote. 'This country’s obsession with the private lives of famous people is tragic.' 'It is an easy choice': In November, the former 30 Rock actor said it was a no-brainer that he would give up his career for the sake of protecting his family - pictured here with wife Hilaria Baldwin and six-month-old daughter Carmen in Madrid earlier this month .","Fresh from his tirade in the New York magazine about how much he hates media scrutiny .

Olympic swimmer Rebecca Adlington has made no secret of the fact she dislikes the shape of her nose. Now the I'm A Celebrity contestant is said to have had cosmetic surgery to give her the perfect profile. Rebecca's situation is one that 21-year-old trainee optician Kate can identify with after she grew up hating a bump she had on her nose which made her paranoid about her appearance. But while Rebecca's nose looks lovely, Kate's bid for perfection went horribly wrong and left her nose even more misshapen than before. Paranoid: Kate as a teenager when she was self-conscious about her nose . Desperate measures: Kate hated her profile so much she had a nose job when she was 18 which left her with scarring, right . Disguise: She was so paranoid about her nose she wore glasses even though she didn't need them . 'I . hated the fact I had a bigger nose than everyone else and there was . a bump on the side of it,' reveals Kate. 'When I first started driving I didn't want . anyone to sit next to me in the passenger seat as they would then have a side ways view of me and my nose. Everyone wants a perfect nose so I decided to have surgery.' The trainee optician decided to go under the knife when she was 18, hoping that the operation would be the answer to her problems and rid her of insecurities. 'I went to the cheapest place I could find and got it done,' she admits. But the lack of research and the cheap deal resulted in a disastrously bungled operation. She was left with more lumps and bumps, a scar across the bridge of her nose and constantly had a bad smell in her nostrils. Corrective surgery: Kate has now had the bump on the bridge of her nose removed, right . 'I've been left with more problems than when I first went in. I wish I hadn't had it done. It looks horrendous,' she said. Kate spent Â£2500 on the procedure but when she complained she was unhappy with her new look, she was told by the clinic to be patient and wait for the swelling and redness to go down. A year later with her nose still swollen, she returned to the clinic to be told the surgeon had fled the country. Three years on, she still has to wear glasses to hide the bumps and scar on her nose despite having perfect vision. Aside from the aesthetic problems she was left with after the inadequate rhinoplasty, Kate was also left with worrying physical complications. She said: 'Now I get nose bleeds quite often, once every two days.' Kate agreed to appear on TLC show Extreme Beauty Disasters to see if they could salvage her damaged nose. Cosmetic surgeon Dr Vik Vijh examined her and was alarmed to see her nostrils were inflamed and her nasal lining in tatters. Now: The optician feels more confident and said she won't wear glasses anymore . Of her scar, he said: 'There is no reason to make an . incision in the nose at the bridge which makes me think somebody . slipped. It looks to me like the surgeon slipped with his chisel and . put it straight through the skin.' Dr Vijh said Kate's only option was to go back under the knife so he could see what was going on beneath her skin following the previous botched op. Swimmer Rebecca Adlington is said she have had a nose job . He was shocked when he discovered the source of the bad scent Kate could constantly smell. The last surgeon had been so clumsy he had damaged Kate's respiratory lining, causing a cyst to form. This was a source of infection which was causing Kate's nose bleeds, discomfort and the bad smell. 'That shouldn't be there, that's not normal,' Dr Vijh said on discovering the cyst. He was able to remove it and then strengthened out Kate's nose by realigning nasal cartilage on the top of the nose. Commenting on the case, Dr Anthony Erian of the London Centre for Cosmetic Surgery (lcas.com) said: 'The . nose is a hugely important facial feature, so although this operation . is straightforward anatomically, it requires the most meticulous . surgical skills, and the aesthetic anticipation and perception of an . artist, in order to form a new nose that will blend in and balance the . whole face. 'With . a reputable surgeon performing rhinoplasty many problems can be reduced . or corrected - long noses can be shortened, crooked noses straightened, . bumps and hooks removed, wide noses can be narrowed, rounded tips . removed and nostrils made smaller. 'I would always . advise finding a safe pair of hands when it comes to this delicate . operation.' After her second operation done by Dr Vijh, Kate was delighted with the results. 'When I used to look at my nose I could just see the lump,' she reveals. 'Now it looks nice and straight. It makes me a lot more confident, I certainly won't be needing the spectacles anymore.'

Photographer Jo Ann Walters is based in New York but grew up in a small working class town in Illinois, along the Mississippi River Valley. There, industrial labor didn't make up part of the workforce - it was the only work, period. 'Nearly everyone I knew had fathers, brothers, husbands, sons, friends and lovers who labored in these local factories, working night shifts, calculating the material and emotional expense of holiday pay and overtime, and who often drank hard and steady,' Waters explained on her personal website. Walters began shooting and compiling the project, which she called DOG Town, in 2004, starting with the hometown that inspired her and branching out to similar places in neighboring states like Ohio and Missouri.

Survivors of Typhoon Haiyan are still desperately hunting for their missing loved ones in the aftermath of the worst storm to ever hit land. Many families were separated in the super typhoon which ripped apart entire villages with winds of up to 147mph and terrifying 20ft waves. More than 4,000 people were killed, around 1.5million have been left homeless and countless others are still missing. With roads and communication lines destroyed, those who reached safety have been left with little choice but to sit and wait for news about those they have lost. But CNN has launched a missing people appeal feature on its iReport platform. Reunited: Aisa Aigbe posted this picture of her mother and family after she lost contact with them following Typhoon Haiyan. She has now found out her mother is alive but her two brothers are still missing . Good news: Distraught Andrew Enderez was working in the United Arab Emirates when the storm struck. He posted this picture of his family on CNN iReport's and was soon told that his wife and children are alive . Many survivors have already reported a loved one missing through CNN, posting pictures and their details, along with desperate pleas for any information that may help track them down. And amazing, some have already managed to find each other because of it. Michael Sacahon used the feature to ask for help to contact his mother Caramen who lived in one of the worst hit areas in Tacloban. He had no way of reaching her as many communication lines were destroyed in the storm. He wrote: 'I only wish to check the current condition of my mother in Tacloban. If she can be assisted to reach Manila, my brother and sister are in Luzon and can take better care of her there.' And incredibly, he was finally able to reach his missing mother shortly after his appeal. He wrote: 'Thanks GOD and we finally able to call her yesterday evening and my mother is fine. I would like to thanks CNN ireport staff for their unending help for everyone who are in need. You gave us hope when everything else seems hopeless. More power to your show! GOD bless every one!' Safe: Michael Sacahon found out his mother Caramen is alive after posting this picture of her . Andrew Enderez, who works as an engineer abroad in the United Arab Emirates, got in touch with iReport as he was desperate for any news about his wife and children who live in Tacloban in the Philippines. He wrote: 'Glimpses of my wife and kids smiling at me every time I come home for a vacation is permanently stuck on my mind. I can’t fathom that such a tragedy I see only in the movies could happen to me.' Mr Enderez has now found out his family are alive but is still trying to find out more information. He said: 'It felt like music to my ears having heard the voice of my eldest son telling me that they are all fine. Four hours later, I was able to talk to my wife who was still crying and is in a state of shock. 'Thank you for your concern and prayers. They hang on literally for their lives and survived this once in a lifetime catastrophic event. 'I would love that CNN will join me to honor our Nanny, Poyen Modesto, a partially blind but courageous person who has really helped my Family during those trying times. 'I will see to it that I can introduce our Nanny to the whole world how brave & strong she is. I love you CNN from the bottom of my heart.' Working in conjunction with Google's crisis finder map, CNN’s iReport allows people to post information about a missing person, such as their name, age, city and a photograph, in an effort to reconnect them. CNN said iReport is being well-used after the storm, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Yolanda, in a similar way to after the Haiti earthquake in 2010. Aisa Aigbe used the tool to ask for information about her mother and other members of her family who live in Tacloban, one of the hardest hit areas by Typhoon Haiyan. Found: Dean Hayes found out his brother Stephen, pictured, is alive after CNN's televised appeal for information . She last spoke with her mother on Thursday morning and was worried about her condition because of the loss of contact. Ms Aigbe wrote: 'I haven't heard any more after the typhoon hit. I feel so miserable here and have been asking for help from everyone, but I still have not been able to locate my mom and the rest of my family. I'm desperate for answers.' But she has since had the amazing news that her mother is safe. She wrote: 'Thank God. My friend who's volunteer to help victims was able to locate my Mom. She's safe although they were starving but still thankful they're safe and alive. I just hope they find my two brothers and they can evacuate the place. Thank you for all the help.' Andrionni Ribo contacted the site about his missing 65-year-old father who had left California in October on an annual trip to his ancestral home in Haro, Philippines. After the typhoon, Mr Ribo couldn't get in contact with his father for several days. When he finally got in touch, his father said he had survived but was desperately looking for food. Thanks to the CNN iReporter, Mr Ribo and his mother got the good news that Josef Ribo made it to Ormoc and was waiting to board a ferry to Cebu. Ribo's brother, who stayed in Tacloban during the storm, was killed in the typhoon. He will be buried Friday. Devastation: Typhoon survivors walk along the shore of the San Jose fishing village on the outskirts of Tacloban on the eastern Philippine island of Leyte more than one week after Super Typhoon Haiyan devastated the area . Rubble: Debris is seen in a Tacloban neighbourhood almost completely flattened by the typhoon. Grieving survivors flocked to shattered churches, as aid workers intensified efforts to reach desperate survivors in remote communities . Last Wednesday, traffic to CNN's website from the Philippines was the highest in the world for a stage - and later on, only second to the US because of the iReport. Dean Hayes was one of many to contact CNN. He was trying to find his brother Stephen and his family, who are just west of Tacloban in Burauen, Philippians. He last spoke with him a week before the storm and while he soon managed to get hold of other family members, had not heard from his brother. But after a televised appeal on CNN for information about Mr Hayes' brother, he got some good news. He wrote: 'Many thanks for the televised report on my missing brother [it was featured on CNNI TV] I'm please to say that he has been found alive and well.' Sarah Brown, the London-based producer of iReport - which has been going since 2006 - spoke to MailOnline about how CNN came up with the idea. She said: ‘After this terrible story we started noticing one or two people posting iReports, saying they are looking for family members or friends. ‘We thought this is something very important, so let’s look at putting together a missing persons assignment, then we can vet and approve it and get it out there. ‘It’s not the first time we’ve done this. During the Haiti earthquake, we got frantic iReports in the US, Dubai, Hong Kong, all searching for loved ones.’ Struggling: The United Nations estimates that 13 million people were affected by Super Typhoon Haiyan with around 1.9 million losing their homes . Survivors of Super Typhoon Haiyan march during a religious procession in Tolosa on the eastern Philippine island of Leyte today as many still don't know if their loved ones are alive or dead . She added that a lack of normal communications is a problem in the Philippines following the storm, and that iReport is a way of helping people make contact. ‘People can’t get through, they’re worried and I think a lot of them just felt if we’ve got an extra platform to get the message out, it might make a difference. ‘One gentleman emailed in on behalf of his Filipino maid, who was looking for her daughter. He emailed us about a day later to say she got a phone call that her daughter was safe. She had had to walk three hours, but managed to put in a call.’ Ms Brown added:  ‘We just hope that everyone can find their loved ones, but I think the most important thing is that if you have a community that gives you fantastic content day in day out, the least you can do is help them. ‘It does give you a feeling of relief (when people are reconnected). We hope to follow up these stories in six months time and see how they’re getting on. ‘For us the situation doesn’t end when they’re found - they’re still in desperate need of food, shelter and help.’ CNN’s iReport team continue to upload missing persons information and updates from iReport to Google’s Person Finder site which was used to help find missing people after the Haiti earthquake. A Google spokesperson said: ‘Google Person Finder was initially created by Google volunteers in response to the Haiti earthquake in January 2010, and today contains contributions from many volunteers inside and outside of Google. It was used again for the earthquakes in Chile, Yushu, and Japan, and now runs at http://google.org/personfinder.'

But you'd be wrong. A Newcastle-based make-up artist has now created a likeness of the future Mrs Kanye West using only lipstick, blusher and eye liner. Beautician and mother-of-four Maxine Ayre, 34, has turned painter, creating realistic artworks of celebrities including Kim, Beyonce and Cheryl Cole using only cosmetics. Maxine Ayre paints the unmistakable images using a range of luxury, professional make-up products to replicate the longed-for beauty looks worn by Naomi Campbell, Beyonce and Cheryl Cole. The finished portrait of Kim Kardashian perfectly captures her signature make-up look, as well as being a stunning portrait of the reality star . Maxine has only . been doing the 'make-up art' for three months, but has already been . inundated with requests from people who want her to emulate their favourite famous . icons. She specialises in using everyday products to capture the pristine celebrity look on canvas - using everything from eye liner and blusher to lip gloss and eye shadow. Maxine said: 'I've been really surprised at the response I get from people on social networks every time I post a picture. 'I have received some lovely comments from some amazing and very talented people who are well recognised in the make-up world. And I am slowly building up followers on Instagram and Twitter. 'I have even received a number of requests from fans of my work, asking me to draw them in make-up.' Maxine uses all the tricks of the trade to create her artwork, which she draws onto canvas, replicating the looks often seen on popular celebrities such as Cheryl Cole . Mother-of-four Maxine has 16 years of . experience working in the beauty industry and now runs her own . freelance hair and make-up company, Maximillion Hair and Make-up. The . inspiration for the portraits came after Maxine watched Naomi Campbell . on TV show The Face, and thought what an amazing job it would be to do . the hair and make-up for the top supermodels. The . young mother purchased pro-charts - a specialist book of paper that is . used to map out make-up ideas for photo shoots - and started to . experiment using different kinds of make-up to match the looks made . famous by some of the most well-recognised female celebrities. Maxine's work - which includes portraits of singers such as Beyonce, pictured - has seen her gain popularity on social media . This portrait of Naomi Campbell is incredibly realistic, despite being painted entirely using everyday make-up items . Maxine posts all of her work on her . Twitter and Instagram pages, and has painted famous faces such as . Beyonce, Naomi Campbell, Kim Kardashian and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. And each one of her pictures is made using enough cosmetic products to do the full make-up for around five brides. Maxine added: 'I find the whole process quite therapeutic, it helps me to relax when the children are in bed. 'But I can be up until the early hours as the hours just seem to fly by.' This picture shows the evolution of Maxine's portrait of Kim Kardashian as she builds up each layer of make up as if on a real person . She added: 'It . takes about two days in total to create one of the images, as I always . like to leave it for a day and come back to it with fresh eyes. 'Then . I just pick up where I left off, as and when I have the time; but with . four kids, a boyfriend and a full time business to run this is now . becoming my ""me time"". 'I . definitely think these charts look better in person as it is quite hard . to capture them in photo, as any change in lighting or angle and it . changes the look completely. 'It . has also become a bit of a running joke between my friends and family . that if anyone asks if I've ever done a celebrity's makeup, I can say, . ""yes, I've done Cheryl Cole's"".'

Businessman-turned-writer Paul Torday, whose novel Salmon Fishing in the Yemen was made into a hit film, has died aged 67. His publishers said the writer, who spent 20 years running an engineering business in his native North East, died yesterday afternoon. Mr Torday was 61 when he published the book that made his name. It sold more than half-a-million copies and was made into a film in 2011 starring Ewan McGregor and Emily Blunt. Kirsty Dunseath, Publishing Director at Weidenfeld and Nicolson Fiction, said: 'In many ways Paul Torday invented his own genre - his extraordinary fiction was filled with warmth and a wry, humane wit. 'He was a gentle observer of the foibles of human nature and our social behaviour. 'He wanted to entertain but his novels were also infused with a deep social awareness, exploring issues such as political expediency, alcoholism, mental illness, class and our national heritage. 'He was a very gentle man, thoughtful and considered in everything he did and it was a privilege and a joy to have worked with him.' He was born in Croxdale, County Durham, in 1946 and went to the Royal . Grammar School in Newcastle. He then won a scholarship to study English . at Pembroke College, Oxford, and then on to a business course in . Manchester. After a couple of short-term jobs, he joined the family business Torday and Carlisle. The Guardian reports he started his writing career when he won a national poetry competition sponsored by the Daily Mail at the age of 16 and the prize paid for his first foreign holiday. He kept on writing poetry for a magazine for the next ten years and even wrote two novels in his 20s but he did not try to publish them. The Independent has revealed the author had been diagnosed with cancer just before his most famous novel was published. He went on to produce a book a year but sadly died before finishing an eighth book. He died at home in Northumberland and leaves his wife Penelope, ex- wife Jane, sons Piers and Nicholas and stepsons Jonathan and Charles.

A massive 36 years of scientific data generated by Nasa’s Voyager spacecraft has been transformed into a powerful piece of piano music. The melody was created by a talented musical manager at Geant, the pan-European data network, which claims to be the most advanced of its kind in the world and serves 50million research users at 10,000 institutions. Launched in 1977, both Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 are now decommissioned but still record and send live data to Earth. A very modern data-driven alternative to Gustav Holst's Planets suite: Orchestral work was created from 320,000 measurements taken by Voyager 1 and 2 . To compose the spacecraft duet, 320,000 measurements were first selected from each spacecraft, at one hour intervals. Dr Vicinanza used proton counts from the cosmic ray detector over the last 37 years from Voyager 1 and 2. Then that data was converted into two very long melodies, each comprising 320,000 notes using different sampling frequencies, from a few KHz to 44.1 kHz. The result of the conversion into waveform created a wide collection of audible sounds, lasting from just a few seconds to a few hours. He used different groups of instruments and different sound textures to represent the two spacecraft. They continue to traverse different . parts of the universe, billions of kilometres apart and Voyager 1 left . our solar system last year. Domenico . Vicinanza, network services product manager at Geant, Cambridge, UK, who is also a . trained musician with a PhD in physics, created the classical duet to . find a new way to represent data through the use of high-speed networks utilised by scientific researchers. He used proton counts from the cosmic ray detector as a basis for the composition. 'I . wanted to compose a musical piece celebrating the Voyager 1 and 2 . together, so used the same measurements (proton counts from the cosmic . ray detector over the last 36 years) from both spacecrafts, at the . exactly same point of time, but at several billions of kilometres of . distance one from the other,' said Dr Vicinanza. 'I used different groups of instruments and different sound textures to represent the two spacecraft, synchronising the measurements taken at the same time,' he added. Domenico Vicinanza, network services product manager at Geant, who is also a trained musician with a PhD in physics, created the classical duet to find a new way to represent data through the use of high-speed networks used by scientific researcher. Here he talks about the composition at the Super Computing 2013 conference . To compose the duet, 320,000 measurements were first selected from each spacecraft, at one hour intervals.

Using the computing facilities at European Grid Infrastructure (EGI), Geant was able to create the duet live at the Nasa booth at the Super Computing 2013 conference in Denver. The result is an up-tempo string and piano orchestral piece. A massive 36 years of scientific data generated by Nasa's Voyager spacecraft has been transformed into a powerful piece of orchestral music. Voyager 1's current mission (illustrated) along with Voyager 2, is to explore the outermost edge of the Sun's domain and beyond . While this project was created as an accessible way to demonstrate the benefits of networks to society, data sonification - representing data by means of sound signals – is increasingly used to accelerate scientific discovery, from epilepsy research to deep space discovery. Dr Vicinanza said: ‘Analysing the melody is exactly the same as looking at data in a spreadsheet, but using the ear. ‘The information content is exactly the same: represented by regularities, patterns, changes, trends and peaks. ‘In fact, data sonification makes it possible to get information about long-range regularities and correlations that are hard to spot just by inspection.’ European scientists are generating an ever-increasing amount of data - for instance at Cern’s Large Hadron Collider – and Geant supports scientific projects so that researchers across Europe can use a super-fast network, which is the most advanced research network in the world. Voyager 1 crossed a new frontier, becoming the first spacecraft ever to leave the solar system, it was reported in September of 2013. Thirty-six years after it was launched from Earth on a tour of the outer planets, the plutonium-powered probe is more than 11 1/2 billion miles from the sun, cruising through what scientists call interstellar space — the vast, cold emptiness between the stars, the space agency said. Voyager 1 actually made its exit more than a year ago, according to Nasa. But it's not as if there's a dotted boundary line out there or a signpost, and it was not until recently that the space agency had the evidence to convince it of what an outside research team had claimed last month: that the spacecraft had finally plowed through the hot plasma bubble surrounding the planets and escaped the sun's influence. Voyager 1 now studies exotic particles and other phenomena in a never-before-explored part of the universe and radios the data back to Earth. The interstellar ambassador also carries a gold-plated disc containing multicultural greetings, songs and photos, just in case it bumps into an intelligent species.","Domenico Vicinanza, a musical manager at Geant, Cambridge, UK, created the classical duet, which has been performed by an orchestra .

Two Polish computer hackers who launched a cyber-attack on one of the biggest online casinos in an attempt to blackmail the owner have been jailed. Piotr Smirnow, 31, and Patryk Surmacki, 35, ordered the Manchester-based boss of the gambling site to give them a 50 per cent share of the company, worth an estimated £30m, or else they would 'take down' the online casino's servers, effectively stopping the website from operating. Manchester Crown Court was told the pair then launched their devastating four-day attack with the help of a hacker in the US. Scroll down for video . Patryck Surmacki (left) and Piotr Smirnow (right) have both been sentenced to five years and four months in prison following an attempt to blackmail the owner of an online casino . They pleaded guilty to two offences each of blackmail and one offence of unauthorised acts on computers. In the first prosecution of its kind, both men were sentenced yesterday to five years and four months in prison. Judge Michael Henshall said he did not accept that Smirnow and Surmacki were 'bungling' and said their crimes involved 'careful planning'. He said: 'It is important that a message is sent to people that commit attacks such as this that there will be sentences that are considerable.' Greater Manchester Police have said the Manchester-based victim had known Smirnow and Surmacki for four years prior to the scam. Smirnow contacted the victim on July 23 and asked to meet him as he had a business proposition. The pair were arrested at a plush hotel at Heathrow Airport after being secretly recorded in an elaborate sting operation by Greater Manchester Police . The victim initially declined but Smirnow persuaded him to meet both of him and Surmacki at Heathrow Airport Terminal 5. The Polish pair demanded a 50 per cent share in the company and told him they intended to crash the server and 'take it down'. Smirnow and Surmacki said they knew a notorious computer hacker and they fully intended to perform a DDOS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack on the company servers. 'They behaved like a couple of sinister . playground bullies who thought they could use the threat of financial . annihilation to extort compliance from these companies' - Detective Inspector Chris Mossop, of the Serious Crime Division . The victim started to record the meeting on his mobile and agreed to meet the hacker, in order to buy his company time. The victim then reported the threats to the police. On August 2, Smirnow and Surmacki carried out their threat and unleashed the DDOS attack, which resulted in the company’s servers going down and prevented any customers from using the site for five hours. It cost the company around £15,000. The court was told they attacked the firm because they believed it would be a 'big hit' and would 'make a lot of noise' in the world of online casinos and they wanted to show they 'could not be pushed around'. They also tried to blackmail the boss of a US-based gaming platform that enables more than 100 online casinos worldwide to function. The pair were arrested at a plush hotel at Heathrow Airport after being secretly recorded in an elaborate sting operation by Greater Manchester Police. Tim Greenald, prosecuting, said: 'The essence of the blackmail was very much that of a protection racket of yesteryear.' During the meeting at Heathrow they were filmed telling the boss of the US-based gaming platform they were 'ready to go and do crazy things' and that they would 'go to war'. The court was told a week-long attack on the US firm would have caused it to lose an estimated $600,000. It is claimed the pair launched their blackmail because they wanted to get back at a former business partner with whom they had fallen out. Richard Wormald, defending, said Smirnow and Surmacki had entered the 'murky world' of online gambling sites and had 'gotten out of their depth'. He said the blackmail was 'ludicrous' and 'ridiculous'. Detective Inspector Chris Mossop, of the Serious Crime Division, said: 'This was a very complex, dynamic investigation that centred on an emerging global cyber-threat. 'Denial of service attacks have become increasingly common offences in recent years and can have a devastating effect on the victim’s online business. 'With millions of pounds and potentially dozens of jobs involved, Smirnow and Surmacki were playing for incredibly high stakes and clearly knew what they were doing. 'They used their intimate, expert knowledge of online business to attempt to bully the victims into submission. But make no mistake, they may have been using the latest technology, but this was simply good old-fashioned blackmail. 'They behaved like a couple of sinister playground bullies who thought they could use the threat of financial annihilation to extort compliance from these companies. 'But their greed was ultimately their downfall as they failed to reckon with the victims’ bravery in the face of extreme intimidation. 'The moment our officers arrested them will no doubt live long in their memories as it as at that point they must have realised the game was up.' The Manchester victim welcomed the sentence. He said: 'I am grateful for the assistance to me provided by the police in this matter. 'This case made me fear for my personal safety as well as for the future of my business, which is why I felt compelled to take action against the perpetrators of this crime. 'No one should have to succumb to blackmail and this sentence should act as a warning to those involved in cyber-extortion that the police and the courts will view this type of conduct very seriously.'","Piotr Smirnow and Patryk Surmacki have been jailed following cyber attack .

French President Francois Hollande last night announced his  separation from Valerie Trierweiler – 15 days after he was caught cheating on her with an actress. After a day of frenzied speculation, Mr Hollande announced: ‘I am making it known that I have put an end to my shared life with Valerie Trierweiler.’ Ms Trierweiler’s position has been considered untenable since Mr Hollande’s two-year affair with Julie Gayet, a 41-year-old actress, was exposed on January 10. Scroll down for video. Happier times: Francois Hollande and Valerie Trierweiler on the night he was elected French president . Love rivals: Ms Trierweiler's split with Hollande follows an exposé of his alleged affair with actress Julie Gayet . Moving on: Ms Trierweiler has been staying at official residence in La Lanterne after the story broke . But the notoriously dithering socialist head of state continually claimed that it was all a ‘private matter’. The announcement effectively ends Ms Trierweiler’s tenure as France’s First Lady. Her . split from Mr Hollande also means she loses her office with five staff, . and numerous other perks including chauffeur-driven limousines and . homes across France. Yesterday’s . statement came as  48-year-old Ms Trierweiler set off on a . ‘humanitarian’ visit to India, where she is expected to speak for the . first time since the scandal broke. Last night she tweeted her first reaction, writing: ‘All my gratitude goes to the extraordinary staff at the Elysee.

Lady, according to Elysee Palace aides. ‘This is the kind of problem which has held up a formal announcement of a separation,’ said one. As . the farce descended to new depths, senior journalists were briefed . yesterday morning that Mr Hollande would announce his  separation from . Ms Trierweiler ‘imminently’. Leading . newspaper websites and  satellite TV channels ran the news as their . main item until about 2.30pm. It was then that an Elysee Palace . spokesman backtracked and said: ‘There will be no announcement today. There are false rumours circulating in the French media.’ French President Francois Hollande, pictured left meeting Pope Francis at the Vatican yesterday, has split from his partner Valerie Trierweiler.

Hollande, who has never married, is now set to concentrate on his . relationship with Ms Gayet. On January 10, photographs appeared in . Closer magazine showing Hollande sneaking in and out of their Paris love . nest, trying to disguise his identity with a crash helmet. The . notoriously volatile Ms Trierweiler, who is twice divorced, first flew . into a rage and then checked herself into a Paris hospital for eight . days, suffering from emotional shock.

The . announcement came as a new opinion poll confirmed that Ms Trierweiler . was by far the most unpopular First Lady in the recent history of . France. Just eight per cent . of respondents to the survey for the Parisien newspaper backed Ms . Trierweiler, a journalist for magazine Paris Match, as a popular First . Lady. Happier times: The couple are pictured in celebrating Hollande's election win in Tulle in 2012, with the leader offering his girlfriend a rose . President Hollande and Valerie Trierweiler, pictured in 2012 on the election campaign trail, have been together since 2006 . After checking out of . hospital, Ms Trierweiler raised eyebrows by moving into La Lanterne, . one of the most luxurious presidential palaces in France, inviting her . mother and other family members to stay with her. Situated . in Versailles, west of Paris, it comes complete with a heated swimming . pool and one of the best stocked wine cellars in  the country. This . caused huge embarrassment to Mr Hollande, a socialist who claims to . ‘dislike the rich’ but who has been blamed for his country’s spiralling . unemployment rate and cost of living. Up . until today, Ms Trierweiler had been desperate to salvage her . relationship with Mr Hollande, telling friends she ‘forgave him’ and . wanted to get back to work. She . was particularly keen to accompany Mr Hollande on a trip to America in . February, when the couple were due to stay with the Obamas at the White . House.

A 19-year-old New York University student jumped 15 stories to his death from a  dormitory early Monday morning and witnesses believe drugs were involved. Police identified Titan Lee-Hai from Port-of-Spain, Trinidad as the student who flung himself off the Third North Residence Hall in Manhattan's East Village at 3:20am. Shazim Khurshid, 19, told the New York Post that it looked like Lee-Hai was on 'a lot of drugs'. Fall or jump? 19-year-old New York University freshman Titan Lee-Hai jumped off the Third North Residence Hall early Monday morning and a witness said it seemed like he was on 'a lot of drugs' 'I was the last person to see him alive,' Kurshid said. 'I was in the elevator, and he just walked in and punched me in the face, and then he asked me where he was. He was naked when he walked in. So, it was pretty obvious he was not in his senses. He had no sense of where he was or what time it was.' When he reached the top floor of the building, Lee-Hai opened a door which triggered the building's fire alarm. After falling, he was taken to Bellevue hospital where he was pronounced dead. Police originally believed the death was a suicide, but now believe drugs were to blame and don't know if Lee-Hai jumped or fell. Toxicology reports won't be available for several weeks.

In his system: Toxicology reports won't be available for several weeks. Shazim Khurshid, right, says Lee-Hai punched him out of the blue before boarding the elevator going up to the top floor . University spokesman John Beckman issued a statement late Monday morning, saying: 'It is with great sorrow that we report that a freshman was found in an interior courtyard in the residence hall where he lived.' Mr Beckman said that the student's death seemed to be the result of a fall, but that police and University officials are investigating what led up to the event to determine the exact cause. 'The University expresses its deepest sympathies to the family and loved ones of this young man; they are in our hearts and our prayers this morning,' Mr Beckman said. A fellow freshman who lives in the dorm said the fire alarm went off around the same time the man jumped. 'We were evacuated from the building at around 3:15. My friends said they saw a body lying in the courtyard. It's sad,' she told the Post. Today marked the first day of the Spring . 2014 semester. Crisis counselors were brought in to provide support to . grieving students this morning. Barred: The university installed special gold bars to prevent students from jumping off the upper floor's of the school's library after a string of suicides in the 2003-2004 academic year . The top 50 college has received a . reputation for its high suicide rate after a string of four deaths in . the 2003-2004 academic year. This prompted the school to install special gold bars on the atrium of Bobst Library where many of the suicides occurred. Students . have argued that while the bars stop suicides from happening in the . library, the university isn't doing a good enough job at addressing the . root of the issue. In an opinion piece published in the student newspaper . a week after the library bars installation, Emma Dolhai argued that the . screen wouldn't stop determined students from finding a way to commit . suicide. 'All the screens really do is ensure that some of [the suicides] are quieter. Screens simply do not prevent self-destruction, in the same way that building prisons does not lower crime rates,' Ms Dolhai wrote. She pointed out that the wait in the university's Wellness Center to see a counselor can be 15 minutes to half an hour and involves a mountain of paperwork. 'The lack of effective health care for the struggling verges on the absurd. NYU Wellness seems to operate on the mantra that a student must make a conscious, devoted effort in order to receive help. Those struggling with suicide, however, are often the last to come forward of their own free will,' she said. According to the Suicide Prevention Resource Center, suicide is the third leading cause of death among young adults ages 18-24. No studies currently track suicide rates at the nation's colleges, but many campus professionals believe it to be the second leading cause of death among students.

Supermodel Elle Macpherson is accused of helping her billionaire husband conceal he was flying a helicopter that crashed last year and took the life of his best friend. Ms Macpherson urged widow Daria Valdez to take the payout after husband Jeffrey Soffer, who also owns Miami’s Fontainebleau Hotel, piloted the chopper into the ground Nov 22, 2012 in the Bahamas, the lawsuit says. Mr Soffer was at the helm despite not being licensed to fly. A licensed pilot was on board the aircraft but not at the controls, the suit alleges. The $100million wrongful death suit was filed Monday in Miami. As if nothing happened: Elle Macpherson and husband Jeff Soffer attend Perez Art Museum last week in Miami . A copy of the lawsuit reviewed by MailOnline claims that Mr Soffer was at the controls when the helicopter when it crashed on Great Cauna Cay last year, taking the life of tax lawyer Lance Valdez. ‘Contrary to published newspaper reports, at the time of the helicopter crash, the helicopter was being piloted by Jeffrey Soffer,’ the suit claims. ‘Soffer was not licensed to fly,’ the suit continues. ‘[Nor was he a] sufficiently experienced helicopter pilot.’ The suit also accuses supermodel Elle Macpherson of taking part in the conspiracy by personally  calling close friends for the purpose of having them convince the devastated widow to take the money. 'Soffer induced…Elle Macpherson…to call Charles Holzer, another close friend of both Lance and Daria, and told him that Soffer was annoyed about Daria’s delay in signing the release, telling Holzer that ‘Soffer doesn’t have to do this you know,' the suit alleges. Taking the millions in hush money meant signing a release relieving Mr Soffer of all liability stemming from the crash, according to the suit. Shattered: Dasha and Lance Valdez in a photo from 2008, the picture of happiness . 'They knew Daria was beset with grief…at the time that they inappropriately pressured her to sign a release they knew was based upon false information,' the suit said. 'They took undue and improper advantage of her and the situation and circumstances surrounding the helicopter crash,' it continued. Pilot David Pearce also signed a lawsuit guaranteeing him a six-figure salary with Mr Soffer's company in exchange for swearing he was piloting the helicopter at the time it crashed, according to the suit. Mr Valdez, 48 and a father of three, was joined on the flight by a handful of other people but was the only one who did not survive the accident, according to the suit. Daria Valdez, now a widow, claims in the suit she was handed $2million in insurance hush money to keep quiet about Mr Soffer piloting the chopper into the ground. According to the bombshell lawsuit, co-defendants Daniel and Paula Riordan, as well as Alex Krys, were also on board the ill-fated flight and conspired with Mr Soffer and the pilot to conceal who was actually flying the chopper when her husband died. ‘The defendants] conspired and otherwise agreed to conceal… [that Mr Soffer] was flying the helicopter at the time of the crash,’ the suit says. ‘The purpose of this concealment and deception was, in turn, to induce [Mr Valdez’s widow] to accept $2million in insurance proceeds from insurance maintained on the helicopter… and to withhold from any civil or other action against [Mr] Soffer,’ the suit explains. The Riordans are employees of Mr Soffer, Mr Krys is his COO, according to the suit. Ms Valdez, who goes by Dasha, according to the Post, was convinced to keep quiet about Mr Soffer’s involvement in her husband’s death while grieving over the loss of the father of her three young children – ages two, seven and nine. Living the high life: Mr Soffer and Ms Macpherson continue to enjoy the high life while Ms Valdez is left to care for her three young children without their father . Trouble in paradise: The helicopter crash happened last year at Great Guana Cay, in the Bahamas . Head of an empire: Billionaire Mr Soffer's assets include the famed Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami . Mr Soffer took advantage of her fragile emotional state in order to avoid ‘his own liability in an exponentially greater amount as compared to the $2million,’ according to the suit. 'Despite being responsible for the loss of his friend, [Mr] Soffer repeatedly lied to and intentionally deceived Daria about his involvement in the crash in an effort to persuade her to pursue an insurance recovery rather than a claim against him.' The suit also claims that Mr Soffer led Mr Valdez to believe he was a licensed and experienced pilot, as well as fled the scene while first responders tried to revive his best friend’s lifeless body. The hotel magnate is licensed to fly - fixed airplanes, not helicopters. 'He was recklessly flying and controlling the helicopter at the time of the helicopter crash without an up-to-date and valid helicopter pilot's license,' the lawsuit further claims. ‘[Mr] Soffer arranged to have himself and the Riordans transported by boat… in order to escape, flee and/or remove himself and the Riordans from the Bahamas before any investigation of the crash could be conducted,’ according to the suit. He did not contact Mr Valdez’s widow until four days later, and also skipped his pal’s funeral. 'Jeff Soffer is very sympathetic to Dasha and the children for their grave loss [and] denies all the allegations of wrongdoing,' his lawyer told the New York Post in a statement. 'Mr. Soffer has no further comments to make at this time since the lawsuit is now pending in federal court.'","The lawsuit claims billionaire Jeffrey Soffer piloted the helicopter into the ground despite not having a license to fly .

Flight Lieutenant Ayesha Farooq, 26, is the first of six female fighter pilots in the force to pass the final exams to qualify for battle. She will now fly missions in a Chinese-made F7PG fighter jet alongside her 24 male colleagues in Squadron 20. 'I don't feel any different. We do the . same activities, the same precision bombing,' said Flt Lt . Farooq. Speaking at the Mushaf base in north Pakistan this week, the fighter pilot, from Bahawalput, Punjab, said: 'In our society most girls don't even think about doing such things as flying an aircraft.' A growing number of women have joined Pakistan's defence forces in recent years as attitudes towards women change. 'Because of terrorism and our geographical location it's very important that we stay on our toes,' she said, referring to Taliban militancy and a sharp rise in sectarian violence . Flt Lt Farooq said her widowed and uneducated mother had not approved of her daughter joining the air force seven years ago. There are 18 other female pilots among . the 4,000 women in Pakistan's 1.4million-strong armed forces, though female recruits mostly do desk jobs and medical work. Like many other forces around the world, women are banned from ground combat. But over the last decade, women have became sky marshals, defending Pakistan's commercial liners against insurgent attacks, and a select few are serving in the elite anti-terrorist force. Ayesha Farooq is the first of 19 female pilot recruits in Pakistan's Air Force to be declared combat-ready . Family pressure against the . traditionally male domain of the armed forces dissuaded other women from . taking the next step to become combat ready, air force officials said. They fly slower aircraft instead, ferrying troops and equipment around the nuclear-armed country of 180 million. Squadron 20's wing commander Nasim Abbas said: 'More and more ladies are joining . now. 'It's seen as less of a taboo. There's been a shift in the nation's, the society's, way of thinking.' Flight Lieutenant Farooq said she did not feel any different from her male counterparts in the PAF . Pakistan now has 316 women in the air force compared to around 100 five years ago, Abbas said. 'In Pakistan, it's very important to defend our front lines because of terrorism and it's very important for everyone to be part of it,' said avionics engineer Anam Hassan, 24, as she set out for work on an F-16 fighter aircraft, her thick black hair tucked under a baseball cap.

In the images that appeared on Facebook she had written  'My body belongs to me' written across her bare chest in Arabic. She was taken into hiding by her family after conservative preachers issued death threats against her. She later attempted another protest on May 19 in the . religious center of Kairouan, where she was arrested. Tyler, also known as Amina Sboui, received death threats after posting these images on Facebook with the words 'my body belongs to me' written in Arabic across her chest . She appeared before an investigating judge in Kairouan today who . will decide if she is to be charged with public indecency and . desecrating a cemetery. Tyler was already convicted of carrying pepper . spray. In Paris, 10 topless Femen members prayed and waved placards outside the Tunisia embassy dressed only in their underwear and stockings. The women wrote slogans across their chest calling for the release of the four women in Tunisia. Other slogans including 'Allah created me free', 'there will be millions of us' and 'woman spring is coming', in reference to a revolution of women's rights similar to the Arab Spring. In Berlin, German government spokesman Steffen Seibert told reporters today that Chancellor Angela Merkel would likely raise questions of human rights and the rule of law during her meeting on Friday with the Tunisian prime minister.

The 800-pound rarely-seen beast was caught in the waters off Miami Beach and the fish was so rare it was like ‘a dinosaur’. Captain Mark Quartiano, a charter boat operator who also goes by ‘Mark the Shark’, posted a picture of the Dactylobatus clarkii, a deep sea species also referred to as ‘hookskate’ or ‘fingerskate’, in an Instagram photo over the weekend. Catch of a lifetime: The 800-pound rarely-seen stingray-like skate fish was caught in the waters off Miami Beach. The fishermen said it was so rare it was like 'a dinosaur' Ancient animal: The skate fish, which lives in muddy waters as deep as 1,000 feet, was so old it had barnacles all over it, say the fishermen who caught it . The monster inhabits muddy sea depths of up to 1,000 feet – this one was caught in waters of about 500 feet deep, Quartiano said. ‘I’ve caught one like it before, but never that size, not in the last 30 years I’ve been doing this,’ Quartiano told ABC News. ‘It’s a very rare fish. It’s like a big gigantic whipping stingray. It’s a dinosaur.’ Not much is known about the deep-sea creature, which the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species classifies as ‘data deficient’. ‘It was very old.

Last month, the appearance of two rare sea serpents washing ashore beaches on the Southern California coast prompted fears it could be a sign that a natural catastrophe is coming. The giant oarfish were dead when they washed up on land, and some scientists believe they come ashore to die because they are ‘in distress’. The first sea monster, measuring 18 feet, was discovered by a woman snorkelling off the coast of Catalina Island on October 13. It took 16 people to drag it up onto the beach. Mega monster: An 18-foot oarfish was discovered by a woman snorkelling off the coast of Catalina Island, California, on October 13. It took 16 people to drag it ashore . Earthquake warning? The two oarfish sightings prompted fears that an earthquake was coming as the bottom-dwelling fish are more sensitive to seismic shifts, according to scientists . The second silvery creature, measuring almost 14 feet, came just a few days later on October 18 in Oceanside, California. Oarfish, which can grow to more than 50 feet in length, are considered the longest bony fish in the world. They typically dive more than 3,000 feet deep, which makes sightings rare and has fueled various serpent legends throughout history. According to traditional Japanese folklore, oarfish rise to the water’s surface before an impending earthquake. Scientists speculate it is because the bottom-dwelling fish are more sensitive to seismic shifts.","The 800-pound Dactylobatus clarkii, a deep sea species also called ‘hookskate’ or ‘fingerskate’, was so old it had barnacles on it .

A lunatic driver who uploaded a video of himself breaking a highly illegal record by driving 26.5 miles around Manhattan in just 24minutes and seven seconds before bragging how he couldn't be traced, has been arrested. Officers swooped on the New York City home of Christopher Adam Tan in East Harlem yesterday and impounded a 2006 BMW Z4 he allegedly used to tear through the streets at breakneck speed in August this year. Tan, who was charged with reckless driving and reckless endangerment, is believed to have uploaded hair-raising footage taken on a dashboard camera onto YouTube video, under the pseudonym, 'Afroduck'. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Smile! Christopher Adam Tang was arrested at his East Harlem home Thursday night . Arrest: A driver using pseudonym 'AfroDuck' who claims he drove . around Manhattan in 24 minutes has been traced by police and ID'd as Tang . This 2006 BMW was impounded at the scene of Tang's arrest . When other YouTube users asked why Afroduck hadn't . waited for a year so he couldn't be traced as previous 'record holders' had done, he said he couldn't be identified from the video and that 'records were meant to be broken'. After news of the stunt made headlines earlier this week, NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly declared war on Afroduck, and made it a priority to track him down. The high-speed journey in a manual 2006 . BMW Z4, begins at FDR/East Side Drive at 116th Street, just outside of Harlem, with Tan weaving through traffic, undertaking moving cars at breakneck speed. He then hurtles across the Williamsburg, . Manhattan, and Brooklyn Bridges, before tearing through the Battery Park . Tunnel and around the downtown tip of the island to beat an earlier 2010 record of 26 minutes, three seconds. Held up: The driver says he stopped at six red lights in his manual 2006 BMW Z4 3.0SI . The illict racer dismissed claims he is a reckless driver, saying he was in control the whole time. While some car enthusiasts on motoring blogs have praised the unknown driver, others say he sets a bad example for young drivers. However the driver has dismissed claims he was reckless while averaging speeds of 66 miles an hour. 'Whether you're a good driver or not, . when you're on the road, you have a high chance of getting hit by a . drunk driver, being cut off, especially in New York,' he told Jalopnik.com. 'Being . a good driver, you're more aware of what is around you. 'Being a fast . driver doesn't mean that you're inherently a bad or reckless driver. 'Like . I said before, I'm in control. That said, understand traffic patterns, . understand what's around you and understand how others control or don't . control their cars.' Record-breaker: The driver raced around the eastern edge of Manhattan and looped around the island¿s southern tip . Dare-devil: The motorist weaved through traffic in the city's tunnel but miraculously avoided a collision . Footage of the journey, compressed into a six-minute clip, shows the driver zip through West Street/West Side Drive, which finally opens up in . Midtown by all of Trump's buildings. Heading north, he turns right by . the George Washington Bridge in Washington Heights and gets across Manhattan at one of its narrowest points. He turns back . onto FDR/East Side Drive and races to the finish line, where he started the trip. Sight-seeing: The driver was probably driving too fast to take in views of the Hudson River on the west side or the East River on the east side . New record? The driver claims to have completed his journey in 24 minutes and seven seconds - the fastest time ever . He said he prepared for the run by working out the traffic flows. 'Other than my car being stocked, I went out various times throughout the night to figure out the traffic patterns,' he told Jalopnik.com. 'I was always in control.

"By . Allan Hall . and Michael Leidig . PUBLISHED: . 21:50 EST, 2 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:45 EST, 3 April 2013 . Natascha Kampusch's father Ludwig Koch claims a second man was involved in his daughter's kidnapping and accuses Austrian police of covering up errors . The father of Natascha Kampusch has accused her kidnapper’s best friend of being his accomplice in a book that also claims Austrian authorities covered up a catalogue of police errors in the case. A secret FBI report into police . cover-ups over the kidnapping is due to be made public this month. Justice officials were . forced to call in neutral investigators from the US agency after . Natascha’s father Ludwig Koch accused local police of widespread . political corruption. He says the strategy to 'avoid a police scandal' allowed the kidnapper’s alleged accomplice Ernst Holzapfel to escape. Natascha was snatched off the streets of a Vienna suburb in 1998 as a 10-year-old girl on her way to school. She escaped eight-and-a-half years . later after enduring years of confinement in a basement cell and sexual . abuse at the hands of her abductor Wolfgang Priklopil. Holzapfel claimed he was 'only a business associate of Priklopil, and had little to do with him privately'. But Koch discovered that the pair . had nicknames for each other - 'Woody' for Holzapfel and 'Wolfi' for . Priklopil - and went on skiing holidays together, spent every New . Year’s Eve together, met regularly in the evenings to go to bars and . play billiards. Holzapfel's sister Margit . Wendelberger even had a relationship with Priklopil and a child by him, according to police files. She denies the claims - but cannot explain why she dealt with his funeral arrangements and legal affairs or why her daughter inherited one of his three properties. Koch's claims were detailed in his . best-selling book Missing, based on 57,000 police files put in the . public domain by his lawyer. Natascha’s father claims that police . were ordered to cover up bungles in the original investigation to . protect the discredited interior minister Liese Prokop from a political . scandal in an election year. 'It may sound unbelievable but . everything in the book is taken directly from the more than 57,000 . police files that were leaked to my legal team,' said Koch. 'It’s not my words. They are facts and evidence from those files.' Priklopil took his secrets to the . grave when he hurled himself under a train just hours after Natascha . escaped while he was making a phone call. Wolfgang Priklopil, left, and Ernst Holzapfel, right, had nicknames for each other and went skiing together . Natascha Kampusch, pictured in February at the premiere of 3,096 Days, the film based on her book . His body was . never properly autopsied and was cremated within hours to be buried in . the Holzapfel family plot. Now Natascha’s father is expecting the FBI report to strengthen his civil case against Holzapfel. 'What Ludwig has said all along and . what he says in the book is that the police always knew someone else was . involved,' explained one family friend. 'The first time they investigated, the police were lazy and incompetent. 'Then when she escaped they covered it up because it was too scandalous to admit. 'Now he hopes the truth will finally be dragged kicking and screaming into the daylight. Koch said: 'The FBI . report can’t come to any conclusion other than the fact that there was . massive interference and errors in the case. 'I can’t do more than I have. But win . or lose, I will have made sure that the information I have has been . recorded for the history books - where the ultimate judgement will take . place.' He says that the evidence leading to Holzapfel after Natasha’s escape - along with evidence that would have led to Priklopil being identified days after the abduction - was ignored. This included a record of telephone . calls the pair had made to each other and Holzapfel’s role in helping . Priklopil escape police shortly before his alleged suicide. The . pair met in Priklopil’s car at a shopping centre in Vienna as thousands . of police officers combed the streets looking for him. Holzapfel is believed to be the last person to have seen him alive. The . book also claims that Holzapfel removed items including computer and . storage disks from Priklopil's house on the day of the escape while . police officers stood around outside. Priklopil also took items from his safe that had vanished by the time he had completed his meeting with Holzapfel. Natascha, pictured shortly after her escape, was held captive for eight and a half years by Wolfgang Priklopil . DNA evidence that showed a third person was in Holzapfel’s car in the two hours after the meeting before it was seized by police. Holzapfel claims what Koch says is a conspiracy theory and produced a suicide note from his dead friend to prove it. A police expert, however, claims that the suicide note could not have been written by Priklopil - and more - that it had actually been written by Holzapfel. When police finally tracked Holzapfel down on the day of Natascha’s escape, they said he started to sweat and appeared nervous. He then asked: 'Has he killed her?' before police told him why they were there. And Koch says that, although . Holzapfel claims he did not know Natascha other than seeing her once . when his friend came to borrow a trailer, they spoke 100 times on the . phone after her escape and Holzapfel's wife made her a pink 18th . birthday cake while she was in captivity. Natascha . told her sisters he had even given her a bottle of Baileys as a . birthday present while Holzapfel’s neighbour gave a statement to say he . had seen Natascha at his house. Koch’s . lawyer Dietmar Heck said: 'We aim to prove [Holzapfel] was involved, . and even if the court don’t accept that then we believe they have to . accept that he must have known she was a victim of Priklopil.' He . said the files show that Holzapfel knew his friend possessed child . pornography, knew that he had a tendency to be cruel and was a racist . who admired Hitler. Ernst Holzapfel, pictured at a 2006 press conference, claimed to be only a business associate of Priklopil and said he had little to do with him privately . He claims that Holzapfel knew that Priklopi hated foreigners because of his own Mediterranean looks that made it difficult for him to get a girlfriend - the same looks that were described by the witness to the kidnapping. It is claimed that Holzapfel knew that the kidnap van matched exactly the one that his friend owned, knew that he had no alibi on the day of the kidnapping, and had even asked him what he was going to say to the police when they turned up to question him. While the interior ministry tried to sweep it all under the carpet, a media frenzy around Natascha led to clashes between her medical team and her lawyers, who tried to get her out to honour contracts with the media. At one point there was almost a fight . between lawyers and doctors as one side tried to drag her away and the . other tried to get her back into the hospital. During . this time, her family were banned from seeing her. Only her lawyers, . her doctors - and Holzapfel - were allowed to visit her in hospital. When . Natasha vanished, Ludwig Koch demanded the investigation not be closed, . came up with new leads and was frequently in the media appealing for . help from the public. Koch . has won the backing of senior Austrian officials including Herwig . Haidinger, 59, who was the head of the Austrian equivalent of the CIA at . the time of the kidnapping investigation. Natascha was held prisoner at this house in Strasshof and Holzapfel claimed he only met her once when Priklopil borrowed a trailer from him . Also backing him are Ludwig Adamovich, the former head of the country’s constitutional court and Johann Rzeszut, the former president of the Austrian High Court. Rzeszut said: 'In 43 years in the legal business I have never seen a scandal like this one.' Koch said: 'People may call me a crank but with people on my team like these it must show there is truth in what I claim.' Austrian lawyer Dietmar Heck said: 'The contents of the police files are explosive and prove clearly that Wolfgang Priklopil the kidnapper was not alone - and that there was a second man.'","Ludwig Koch makes claims based on 57,000 police files on the case .

Singaporean businessman Dan Tan Seet Eng, also known as Dan Tan, is accused of heading a crime syndicate that made millions of dollars betting on rigged Italian football matches. The Singapore Police Force confirmed that they were questioning Tan and it is thought he is a key figure in the ‘Last Bet’ investigation into corruption in football by global law enforcers Interpol. Members of the betting syndicate named in international arrest warrants. Dan Tan Seet Eng is pictured top left . Interpol secretary general Ronald Noble said the arrest of Admir Suljic and the questioning of Singaporean businessman Dan Tan Seet Eng, also known as Dan Tan, show that they are not above the law . The crime group is thought to be made up of people from Singapore and the Balkans and are believed to have manipulated the results of Italian league matches in the 2009-10 and 2010-11 seasons. A police statement said: ‘Dan Tan Seet Eng, a Singaporean who has been named in reports so far, is currently assisting Singapore authorities in their investigations. ‘We have been offering assistance and sharing available information with affected countries and will continue to do so.’ 'Key element': Admir Suljic was arrested on Thursday accused of criminal association aimed at sporting fraud and considered key in the probe into match-fixing between 2009 and 2011 . The move came after Italian police . arrested Tan's alleged associate, Slovenian Admir Suljic, on Thursday, . after he had been on the run since December 2011. Police in Singapore . gave information to Interpol which made Suljic’s arrest possible. Suljic, who is accused of criminal association aimed at sporting fraud, flew to Milan from Singapore to turn himself in to the authorities. He is considered a 'key element' in the probe into match-fixing between 2009 and 2011. An arrest warrant has also been issued for Tan but the Singapore Police Force did not say if it would turn him in to international authorities. Interpol secretary general Ronald Noble said the arrest of Suljic, followed by the questioning of Tan, is ‘important because the world believes that law enforcement can't do anything to take down this criminal organisation, the world believes that (Tan) and his associates can't be touched, that they are above the law’. Mr Noble said: ‘We will follow the rule of law. ‘The hope is that (the suspect) will cooperate with law enforcement and tell us all he knows.’ Italian Police said Suljic would be taken to a prison in the city of Cremona. The . Italian police said in a statement: ‘His direct involvement in the . international criminal group, made of Singapore nationals and people . from the Balkans, has emerged from the investigation.’ FIFA's security director Ralf Mutschke (pictured with Mr Noble) admitted soccer officials had underestimated the scope of match-fixing after FIFA revealed estimates that organised crimes takes as much as £9.6bn a year by fixing matches .

'Fixing of matches for criminal gambling fraud purposes is absolutely endemic worldwide... arrogantly happening daily.'

In Italy alone, a recent rigging scandal is estimated to have produced £1.6 billion for the Camorra and the Mafia crime syndicates, Eaton said. The total amount of money generated by sports betting would equal the gross domestic product of Switzerland, ranked 19th in the world. Sportradar, a company in London that monitors global sports betting, estimates that about 300 football games a year in Europe alone could be rigged.

Controversial: Britain's top military academy, Sandhurst, has come under fire for renaming a sports hall commemorating a First World War battle after the King of Bahrain. British soldiers are pictured at Mons . Britain’s top military academy, Sandhurst, has come under fire for renaming a sports hall commemorating a First World War battle after the King of Bahrain. The Mons Hall – named after the 1914 battle where thousands died  – will have its name changed to  honour the Bahraini monarch who has given millions in funding to the Army’s officer training college. The building will now be called King Hamad Hall and will reopen next month after being refurbished thanks to a £3 million donation from the king, who is the patron of the Sandhurst Foundation but is known for brutally repressing demonstrators at home. Sandhurst has also accepted a  £15 million donation from the United Arab Emirates to build a new accommodation block, raising questions about the college’s links with authoritarian Gulf states accused of human rights abuses. Critics say the Army is betraying the soldiers who gave their lives and that Bahrain and the UAE are trying to avert criticism of their regimes by buying silence with donations. The 1914 Battle of Mons was the first major battle of the war. Against  overwhelming odds, the British Army inflicted 5,000 casualties on the Germans. At least 1,600 British troops were killed. The Mons Hall is due to be reopened next month. King Hamad has been invited and a plaque will be unveiled with the inscription: ‘King Hamad Hall. This building, the former Mons Hall, was refurbished in 2013 with a generous gift from the Kingdom of Bahrain.’ Last night, MP Jeremy Corbyn said: ‘There’s something deeply ironic in renaming a hall that was in memory of soldiers who died in a tragic battle in the First World War in honour of a king who is routinely committing human rights abuses, including the shooting of demonstrators. I’m appalled. 'We should not be accepting money from such people. It’s simply wrong. They are in effect trying to buy our silence.’ And MP Andy Slaughter, Labour’s chairman of the Democracy In Bahrain all-party parliamentary group, said: ‘To change the name of something which commemorates a very tragic episode in British military history and an example of courage and heroism of British soldiers  simply because they’re getting a sum of money from a rather dubious source is appalling. Criticism: The Mons Hall - named after the 1914 battle where thousands died  - will have its name changed to honour the Bahraini monarch. Young officers are pictured on parade at Sandhurst . Visit: Prince Charles with King Hamad on his left and the Crown Prince of Dubai, far right, at Sandhurst . ‘It reflects the appalling double standards the British Government and institutions have in relation to the Bahraini regime, which is guilty of all sorts of human rights abuses and fundamentally undemocratic.’ Thousands of protesters took to the streets of Bahrain last week on the second anniversary of the Gulf state’s pro-democracy uprising and on Thursday a 16-year-old boy was shot dead. It is thought that more than 50 people have been killed since the uprising began. The Mail on Sunday has learned that Sandhurst has also accepted a £15 million donation from the UAE, despite repeated criticism of the regime’s human rights record. The money was used to build a new accommodation block for officers, named the Zayhed Building, after the first UAE president. The Crown Prince of Dubai, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, who was trained at Sandhurst, opened it in November. Amnesty International says that about 90 political prisoners are currently detained in the UAE. A 2006 parliamentary report described the UAE as having a ‘serious democratic deficit’. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: ‘All donations to Sandhurst are in compliance with the UK’s domestic and international legal obligations and our values as a nation. ‘Providing defence training and education to overseas cadets at the same high standards used by UK Armed Forces helps to save lives and raise awareness of human rights.’","Sports hall that honoured dead of WW1 renamed after oil state's ruler .

"By . Keith Mcdowall . PUBLISHED: . 19:28 EST, 27 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 21:05 EST, 27 March 2013 . Considering the strength of feelings still against him, you might expect any day now to see the remains of the Sixties rail chief, Dr Richard Beeching, disinterred and dragged in shame round the streets of London. For in popular legend, Dr Beeching is synonymous with the mass destruction of Britain’s rail network. Mere mention of his name triggers images of a mad axeman. Last Saturday marked the 50th anniversary of the publication of his famous report, Reshaping The British Railways, which led to a massive programme of track and station closures. This lust to blame him for everything that is still wrong with our railways seems unquenchable. It is 50 years since Dr Richard Beeching published his report but his legacy should be of saving the railways, according Keith McDowall, the Mail's former Industrial Editor . Richard Beeching (right) chairman of the British Railways Board at Paddington Station . For example, the much-loved former Python star and TV travel presenter Michael Palin says Beeching left ‘a psychological and environmental scar unmatched by the scaling down of any other industry’. The writer Matthew Engel argues that Beeching must carry the can for putting the knife to 24,000 miles of track linking the rural communities to our towns and cities. Even at the time, the Labour cabinet minister Richard Crossman said: ‘Beeching is hardly a winsome personality. He makes every cut in a local service look like a piece of deliberate cruelty and any closure like an act of class war.’ Yet I knew Beeching well while working as the Daily Mail’s Industrial Editor. His image as a penny-pinching accountant with no understanding of this country’s rich railway heritage or of the needs of the travelling public could not be further from the truth. I can honestly say that the portrait of him as a cruel, number-fixated bureaucrat is an absurd caricature. True, his report identified 2,363 stations — one-third of those in the network — and around 6,000 miles of track to be closed. Not surprisingly, his proposal sparked outrage from commuters, local councils and the trade unions, who were appalled at the talk of 70,000 job losses. There was particular anger in some major towns, such as Mansfield, where people feared they might be left without any rail link. Yet the truth is that Beeching was a courageous man who forced the railways to face up to commercial realities. Contrary to what his critics pretend today, Britain’s railways were in a desperate mess. A modernisation plan had been introduced a few years earlier to reduce losses but had made little impact. By 1961, when Beeching launched his commission, the network was losing £140 million a year — a staggering sum for that period. Battles between management and the unions were rife, and led to a rail strike in 1955 which lasted 17 days and so badly paralysed the country that the Government had to call a state of emergency. As chairman of the British Railways Board, Beeching bravely challenged this culture of waste and saw it as his duty to drag the railway industry into the modern world. The truth is that whoever had been in charge of the railways, some sort of cuts would have been necessary. Much of the equipment dated back to Victorian times, as did many working practices. The Beeching report - The Reshaping of British Railways - has been criticised for 50 years . Beeching’s report set out in stark terms how nearly half of the nation’s 7,000 railway stations generated only 2 per cent of the total rail traffic, while one-third of the entire track carried just one per cent of the traffic. Two-thirds of the rolling stock was not used all the year round. One extreme example of this under-use highlighted by Beeching was in Norfolk, where the line between Thetford and Swaffham carried an  average of only nine passengers on five trains a day. The income from these journeys covered barely ten per cent of the route’s costs. The railways were not just highly inefficient, but they were also facing serious competition from cars and lorries using new roads. Petrol was cheap and as the country emerged from the period of shortages during World War II, more people found they could afford a car. Increasingly this was the most popular form of travel, rather than families having to wait in dismal stations to sit on cold trains. In 1938, there were 1.9 million privately owned cars in Britain, but the figure rose to more than six million by the time Beeching became rail chairman in 1961. Under the recommendations rural statiosn such as Aldermaston, pictured, were closed down . Beeching's legacy should be as a 'courageous' man who faced up to the unions, writes Mr McDowall . The M1 had just been built in 1959 and rail freight was severely undercut by the new road haulage industry. Beeching had the guts to devise a coherent, workable scheme to rationalise the country’s railway system. As he himself put it rather wistfully: ‘I suppose I will always be remembered as the axeman, but it was surgery, not mad chopping.’ Born in Sheerness, Kent, in 1913, Beeching went on to gain a first-class honours degree in physics from Imperial College in London and got a PhD for his research into electrons. After working with armaments at the Ministry of Supply during the war, he embarked on a highly successful career with the chemical giant ICI. His talent for management, allied to his analytical skills, brought him to the attention of the Government, and in 1961 the Conservative Transport Minister Ernest Maples persuaded him to become chairman of the British Railways Board. Immediately, Beeching was plunged into controversy — insisting he ought to be paid the same level of salary he had received at ICI, which was £24,000 (the equivalent of about £390,000 today). This was two-and-a-half times the salary of any chief of any other national industry, and 35 times the pay of the average railway worker. It should be remembered, however, that in those days of soaring income tax, the state took a massive proportion of high earners’ pay. In fact, Beeching told me that when he was hired for any speaking engagement, he usually asked for a box of good Havana cigars instead of a fee because the exorbitant level of tax meant it was hardly worthwhile being paid. As railway chairman, he set to work. He ended all the excessive duplication and waste, which were a legacy of the network’s Victorian creation, and concentrated efforts on its core trunk routes, running trains at higher speeds between the main urban centres. A Stannier 8F No 48773. Keith McDowall says Dr Beeching forced the industry out of the steam age . The under-used rural lines, sidings and goods yards were indulgences that could no longer be afforded. Indeed, in some areas there was little for rural station workers to do on these routes apart from signalmen occasionally lugging at a lever to let an empty train go through — and then return to do a spot of gardening around their station box. Beeching was a visionary as well as a rationalist. His most important contribution to revolutionising Britain’s transport system was how he predicted that, in the future, goods were going to be moved round the world as freight, in huge boxes, and that Britain risked being left behind by its foreign rivals. The country was not going to need 30,000 dockers in London’s West India Dock, 10,000 in Tooley Street, Southwark, and 7,000 in Surrey Commercial Docks. The work would be centred on massive ports such as Tilbury, Essex, where huge containers could be moved by cranes rather than by men. The same applied to the docks in Liverpool, Glasgow and Southampton. The historic Bluebell Railway ran its first steam-train this month on the reclaimed line from Kingscote to East Grinstead after it was closed in March 1958 as part of the Beeching Cuts . So Beeching created new freightliner rolling stock and a new infrastructure of depots around the country to meet this demand. Sadly, the National Union of Railwaymen undermined the effectiveness of the new freightliners by insisting, as a job retention measure, that there must be a guard at the rear of every train. Journalists such as me pleaded with Sid Greene, the long-serving NUR general secretary, but he could not move his men to accept what Beeching had proposed. Clearly, Beeching had picked up a poisoned chalice, but he did not flinch from his task. He also cut layers of management, shook up a deeply engrained culture of set procedures and practices, some of which dated from the beginning of steam, and challenged the rail industry’s tendency to warn that any change would endanger safety. Of course, Beeching was a convenient lightning rod to deflect unpopularity away from the politicians. However, for all the blame heaped on him, he did not take the actual decisions on line closures. That was done by transport ministers in the Tory and Labour Governments of the Sixties. The iconic train was back up and running 50 years on from Dr Beeching's report . Indeed, Labour’s Harold Wilson cleverly exploited public discontent with Beeching in the run-up to the 1964 General Election, but then when elected he did nothing to reverse the cuts and even pushed ahead with some closures that Beeching had never recommended. But Wilson’s transport secretary Barbara Castle forced Beeching out of his job in 1965. In fact, I organised his farewell lunch on his last day in the role at his favourite haunt, the then magnificent Great Western Hotel (now a soul-less Hilton hotel) in Paddington, West London. It was there, in a secret room in the hotel, that he finally won agreement with the rail unions to face up to his modernisation programme. What Beeching’s critics so often ignore is that in the long-term his cost-cutting was a success. In contrast to most other parts of the Western world, Britain’s railways are now flourishing. In recent decades, the network has enjoyed a phenomenal renaissance, with passenger numbers now at their highest levels since the Twenties. Yes, there are plenty of problems such as overcrowding, but at least there is new investment going into the railways. So I say ‘hats off’ to Dr Beeching. British management could have used many more like him in the Sixties to tackle the nation’s industrial decline and to create real jobs. Come to think of it, if pioneers like Beeching had met with more success, we might not be in the economic mess we are today.","The Mail's former Industrial Editor Keith McDowall knew Richard Beeching .

Baroness Warsi last night refused to back David Cameron’s gay marriage bill, over fears it does not provide enough protection for religious groups. The faith minister and former Tory party co-chairman abstained on a crunch vote in the House of Lords where an attempt to throw out the bill was crushed. Although members of the Government were given a free vote, many have privately felt under pressure to comply with the Prime Minister’s push for same-sex marriage. Minutes before the vote, Lord Ancram, the former Tory party chairman, even urged ministers to give assurances that Tory peers would be allowed a ‘genuinely free vote’ after concerns that MPs were bullied into backing the Government. But Lady Warsi refused to follow other Conservatives and vote in favour of the Bill, telling the Mail: ‘I have a number of ongoing concerns which have been raised by faith communities and others. 'I am in discussion with colleagues about them. At this stage, I felt that I could not vote for the Bill and so I abstained.’ Her remarks came as the party leadership warned that grassroots activists were abandoning the Conservatives over gay marriage. A survey by ITV News showed three-quarters of local associations have lost members – and half of these said it was because of attempts to legalise same-sex marriage. Despite their misgivings, Britain was a step closer to legalising gay marriage last night. Gay weddings could be conducted as early as summer next year if it is brought into law. Religious organisations would be able to ‘opt in’ to offer gay weddings, although the Church of England would be banned in law from doing so. A ‘wrecking’ amendment by Lord Dear, a former chief constable, was defeated by 390 votes to 148. Lord Dear had warned the legislation would ‘completely alter the concept of marriage as we know it’. The bill was ‘ill-thought through’, had no democratic legitimacy and was ‘fatally flawed’, he said. Critics of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill had argued that it had been fast-tracked through Parliament and was not in the Conservative Party’s manifesto or Coalition Agreement. In one extraordinary intervention, Lord . Dannatt, the former head of the Army, said the legislation was against . everything he had fought for as a soldier for 40 years. Proponents of single sex marriage dressed as a bride and groom, stand outside the Houses of Parliament. Despite misgivings, Britain is now a step closer to legalising gay marriage . Although members of the Government were given a free vote, many have privately felt under pressure to comply with the Prime Minister's push for same-sex marriage . Lord Mawhinney, another former Tory party chairman, said he was sad that Mr Cameron failed to listen to concerns over the bill. He accused Lord Feldman – co-chairman of the party – of snubbing his call for a meeting with the Conservative Grassroots movement so they could hand deliver a letter of protest. In a dig at claims that Lord Feldman had privately criticised Tory activists at a dinner, Lord Mawhinney said that instead of listening to their concerns ‘we get referred to as “swivel-eyed loons”.’ During the debate, Baroness Stowell of Beeston, the equalities minister, said the legislation was a ‘force for good’. The bill – which applies to England and Wales – will now face further scrutiny in the Lords, when peers are expected to attempt further amendments. The Scottish government has also pledged to introduce gay marriage.","Baroness Warsi fears it doesn't have enough protection for religious groups .

TV historian Tessa Dunlop first met her future husband while teaching in Romania when he was just a boy. The 37-year-old who is probably best known for BBC2's popular programme Coast has also worked on history shows around the world. She first traveled to the eastern European nation in 1993 while it was going through its shocking orphan crisis. Fresh from having been rejected by Oxford University as an 18-year-old, she hoped the experience suggested by her father would boost a future Oxbridge application. She ended up staying in Romania for 10-months, and it worked with a new application to study modern history at Oxford accepted. But the huge impression the eastern European nation left on the teenager saw her return to Romania a year later to teach English. Life long association: Tessa Dunlop the writer and TV presenter at her home in south London . It . was during that second trip that she first met the brother of one of . her students, who she has since married, but will only refer to as . 'Vlad', as he hates the limelight. Dunlop is 'obsessive' about Romania and said 'I just think it's a f****** great country. I got so much from that year. I owe Romania. 'It gave me my balls; it gave me a lot of my identity; it gave me a whole fresh look at life.' She found Oxford life 'pompous' while studying after the gritty basics she experienced while at the orphanage. At the time Romania she had found shockingly poor conditions, and children so damaged they compulsively self-harmed. The older children would fight with her and steal from her, but the contrast to her own sheltered upbringing left her felt needed and loved in a way she had never experienced before. On her second trip to Romania when she met her future husband their romance was beyond the ordinary because Dunlop was 19 and Vlad was 12. Close: Tessa Dunlop with her father Donald who died in 2009 and donated his body to medical science . She was often invited to the family home for super and came to single out Vlad as a bright, canny child with an ear for language. He started going to her English classes, becoming a top pupil, although she said at the time here interest was not romantic. She said: 'Of course it never occurred to me that, you know... [but] I noticed a stillness in him, a peacefulness, I think is the word, that made him stand out.' Keen to help her friend she organised a scholarship for Vlad to study at her former boarding school, Strathallan in Perthshire. Dunlop didn't visit him while he was at the school, enjoying her own student life at Oxford, getting into rowing and boyfriends. Sporty: Tessa Dunlop at Herne Hill Velodrome in south London in 2009 .

After graduating Dunlop moved to London, landing a job on talk radio station LBC in the 1990s, starting on the night-time shift. She progressed well and was handed her own daytime show to present, but Romania remained in her thoughts. She went to visit the country again, visiting Vlad's family again, and fell in love - he was 19, and she was 27-years-old. She said: 'I just knew, it was like bang. We didn't kiss or anything but I just felt it.' The age difference never felt wrong she said, and the pair kept in touch via email and then phone, spending up to £400 a month on calls. The romance is detailed in her new book, To Romania With Love, her autobiography about their romance. Happily married: Tessa Dunlop . She declines to reveal her husbands real name in the book because he hates the fact she has even written it. Despite his concern it describes how when they were first together, Vlad seemed more interested in being a teenager, than with a London based radio presenter. It was at that time that Dunlop's father, who she was very close to, was diagnosed with terminal bone cancer. She distracted herself from the devastating blow by pouring even more energy into her obsession with Vlad - relentlessly worrying about his smoking. Eventually her mother stepped in writing to him, asking him to give up tobacco because her daughter was so upset, and demonstrating some commitment, he did. While Dunlop's father was mostly against the match, her mother favoured the young Romanian, and helped research how he could move to London. They eventually married in Romania, and Dunlop's father who died in 2009, had finally accepted the union although it wasn't his ideal in his opinion. More guilt about their pairing came from his family, with Vlad's mother sobbing at the wedding that her son was being stolen away with his move to Britain. Despite the unusual start, family difficulties, cultural divide and long distance, the couple now have a three-year-old daughter Mara, who is fluent in English and Romanian. Dunlop said: 'So, I fell in love with a younger man. So what? It happens all the time the other way around all the time. We were in love and we're still in love.' To Romania with Love will be published by Quartet Books on May 31 at £12.","Pair first met while she was at Oxford University and before he could speak English .

"By . Sarah Oliver . PUBLISHED: . 17:12 EST, 11 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:32 EST, 11 May 2013 . Betrayed: Faiza Ahmed fled her home in Stockport after her marriage collapsed. She blames Lauren Booth, Cherie Blair's half-sister . Peace activist and Muslim convert Lauren Booth has been branded a home-wrecker by the woman who is still married to her new husband, Sohale Ahmed. Faiza Ahmed has fled her home in Stockport, Greater Manchester, and taken her three children to  her brother’s house in Texas to recover from the collapse of her 16-year marriage. The 37-year-old childminder and bilingual teaching assistant claims that Ms Booth – the half-sister of Cherie Blair –  has betrayed her newly acquired Muslim faith. She accuses her of openly flirting with Sohale in front of her, spending the family celebrations of Ramadan and Eid with him, and marrying him in secret. Speaking from the house in a gated community where she has taken refuge, Mrs Ahmed said: . ‘Lauren destroyed my home. You can’t just put on a hijab and say you are a good Muslim woman – it’s about having boundaries with men, and love and respect for women. ‘She came into my house as my and my husband’s guest and did this under my nose. Her behaviour appals me, and other Muslim women  – the very people she professes to support – must now judge her.’ Her words are a major rebuke to Ms Booth, 45, whose Facebook announcement of her marriage was revealed by The Mail on Sunday last week. It followed a jokey advert placed on the social networking site last year saying she was hunting for a husband, and that ‘Mossad agents, secret drinkers, CIA stooges, men who don’t pray and men who don’t pay’ need not apply. Last night Mrs Ahmed told how her marriage to Sohale, 49, faltered as he devoted increasing amounts of time to promoting Muslim charity and fundraising events involving Ms Booth. She knew they were business associates and Sohale described Ms Booth as his ‘sister’ – a Muslim term of respect. Mrs Ahmed first met Ms Booth, who is now recognised across the United States, Asia and the Middle East as a public speaker, when she came to stay at the Ahmed family home in March 2012. Mrs Ahmed said: ‘I cooked for her and then I stayed at home with the children while my husband and Lauren went out together. They came home late and I saw how open she was with him . ‘She was joking around doing silly accents, Scottish and Asian. It was funny, but in the presence of a supposedly strange man, it was wrong. ‘This is not the way Islam tells a woman to be. Usually reverts [as Muslim converts are called] are even more strict and zealous. They see Islam in black and white, unlike those of us who are born to it.’ Faiza Ahmed with her husband of 16 years Sohale and their two children in 1994 . Later that evening, after demanding that her husband come upstairs to bed, Mrs Ahmed claims she was shocked to see him emerging from Ms Booth’s room. ‘He said he’d just popped in to collect something and brushed aside my suspicions but I was shocked and furious with him,’ she said. ‘They looked like more than friends or business associates. I was devastated. It was killing me. I told Sohale that even though I knew he was not going to stop seeing her, she was not allowed back into my house. Muslim convert: Lauren Booth married Sohale after coming to stay at the Ahmed family home in 2012 . 'He started going away on business for three and four days at a time, and sometimes being in London  at weekends.’ In . April 2012, Sohale launched the Gaza fundraising charity Peace 2012, . and signed up Ms Booth as a  co-director two weeks later. The charity is registered to his parents’ home in Stockport and its stated aim is to provide food, water, houses and power to Gaza’s deprived areas. Mrs Ahmed continued: ‘Ramadan was in August and I expected us all to be together, but Lauren was in Manchester. Sohale wanted her to stay with us and I said no way. ‘He responded by staying out almost all night with her, coming back perhaps at 1am and leaving again at 2.30am. I asked him what kind of charity fundraising went on at these times. ‘He ate his sehri [the pre-dawn meal] and his iftar [the meal which breaks the daily fast of Ramadan] with Lauren, which felt like he was spurning his real family. ‘On Eid Day, Lauren arrived home from the mosque with Sohale and other family members but no one warned me. I walked out of my kitchen and she was there in my front room in full make-up, dressed from head-to-toe in red, the traditional colour of a Muslim wedding dress. She looked like a bride. ‘She followed me back into the kitchen and said, “I am sorry I stole your husband!” She meant the time she’d spent with him over Ramadan but I told her flatly that I missed him and did not approve. Later he spent all his time attending to her and they went off into the night. None of his family members said anything to him.’ Ms Booth later wed Sohale in a secret nikah, or religious ceremony. Such a ceremony is significant in faith terms but is not recognised as legal in Britain unless it takes place in another country where it is considered a legal way to marry. Technically, Sohale’s faith permits him to take up to four wives but it is becoming more culturally acceptable to have just one. Islamic law states a first wife should be informed about subsequent unions and while she cannot object, she should be given the opportunity to ask for a divorce. Ex-husband: Peace activist booth was formerly married to actor Craig Darby. She divorced him after he suffered serious brain injuries in a 2009 motorbike crash. They have two daughters . But Ms Booth and Sohale kept their . nuptials secret from Mrs Ahmed until February this year when she says he . asked her for a divorce in a telephone call. He also sent a text to say he was married. Mrs . Ahmed found out from Sohale’s brother that his bride was Ms Booth. The . peace activist was formerly married to actor Craig Darby and they have . two daughters. She . divorced him after he suffered serious brain injuries in a 2009 . motorbike crash which ended the idyllic life they had built for . themselves in the Dordogne. She announced her conversion to Islam in October 2010 saying: ‘It was probably an appreciation of Muslim culture, in particular that of Muslim women, that first drew me towards a broader appreciation  of Islam.’ She has since championed Muslim women’s rights, addressing an international conference in Malaysia in 2011 and seeking support on Facebook for a debate on polygamy. Mrs Ahmed admits her relationship with Sohale had been troubled since 2010 – they underwent a trial separation that year. However, she insists she never wanted . a divorce. They were discussing a reconciliation and their physical . relationship continued until March this year. Activist:  Booth addresses a mass anti-war demonstration marking the 10th anniversary of the Afghanistan war, in London's Trafalgar Square . For now, Mrs Ahmed has enrolled her children – aged 13, 11 and six – at a school in Texas. She says: ‘There is so much mess and damage at home that I don’t know when I’ll be able to face going back. ‘Lauren has cost him his family, his friends, me and his children. All he has in his life is her. When he told me he loved me, he always used to say, “You are my first wife, and my last.” But he broke his promise.’ Neither Ms Booth nor Sohale could be reached for comment.","Faiza Ahmed has fled her home in Stockport, Greater Manchester .

Tragic: Talented high school musician Benjamin Edward LaMontagne died in his mother's arms in the early hours of Saturday after his condition started to deteriorate following a routine dental procedure . If his death is found to have been caused by surgery complications, it would be a rare occurrence, according to dentists.

'We recognized the challenges with providing emergency response on a . rural Maine island.' Benjamin's mother Lynn first called for assistance around 1am Saturday when Benjamin had stopped breathing. The teen had reportedly suffered some typical swelling and pain following the procedure and by Friday it had intensified. And by the early morning hours, he was dead. Dr . Thomas Dodson said that in 20 years of surveys at the Massachusetts . hospital he used to work at, not a single death was recorded in patients . who had wisdom teeth extracted. The dentist, who is chair of the Department of Oral . and Maxillofacial Surgery at the University of Washington in Seattle, . had not reviewed Benjamin's case but has decades of experience. 'I’m . trained as an epidemiologist, and I can’t say I’ve even ever read . [about a death] anywhere,' he told the Portland Press Herald. 'The best part about him was that he did his own thing, he went his own way,' said LaMontagne¿s closest friend Christian Cilley, left. 'You could either jump on the train or watch it fly by' The .

Conservatory of Music. The teenager, who played bass clarinet and enjoyed jazz, was a dedicated student who also enjoyed sailing and lobster fishing.
