Jurisprudence: Huang Qifan, Mayor of Chongqing, recommended Chinese judges take tips from Hollywood films . A Chinese mayor has told judges to watch Hollywood films to help them deal with moral dilemmas in important cases. Huang Qifan, the Mayor of Chongqing, said tense courtroom dramas and heart-wrenching action movies could teach them valuable lessons about dispensing justice. In the unorthodox contribution during a panel discussion at the National People's Congress in Beijing, Mr Huang argued that in a Hollywood narrative, good will overcome evil, juries can be swayed by a compelling speech and a hero is often torn between emotions and a rational choice. But all such genres can provide helpful guidance for judges, he said. Although Mr Huang did not name any films specifically, some were recognisable from the plot. They included the 1996 action film The Rock in which a renegade general, played by Ed Harris, takes over Alcatraz prison and threatens to use chemical weapons against U.S. citizens until Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage save the day. Although a smash hit at the box office, the film, produced by the same team behind Top Gun, was not considered a masterpiece by critics. Movie magic: Mr Huang appeared to make reference to the 1996 film The Rock starring Sean Connery and Nicholas Cage . Film lessons: Perhaps Mr Huang was referencing the 1992 classic A Few Good Men when he said U.S. lawyers can 'seduce the jury's emotions' But Mr Huang evidently felt some wise lessons could be drawn in between the car chases, explosions and combat scenes. Certainly Connery's character, who has been held in a U.S. prison without trial for 30 years because he was accused of stealing state secrets, could be recognised in China's often opaque justice system. Mr Huang drew particular attention to the fact he is convinced to help the authorities thwart the terrorist plot in exchange for his freedom. He also made reference to American lawyers and their knack for turning a seemingly impossible-to-win case around. 'It's important to see how U.S. lawyers seduce the jury's emotions,' he said. There was one caveat however to the mayor's endorsement of judges taking up film studies - they should only watch movies on their days off.","Huang Qifan, Mayor of Chongqing, made unorthodox contribution during panel discussion at National People's Congress .

Albert Goering, who died in 1966, could be recognised for his efforts to save Jews during the Holocaust . The younger brother of senior Nazi Hermann Goering could be honoured for risking his life to save Jews during the Holocaust. Albert Goering, a German businessman who died in 1966, is believed to have saved hundreds of Jews and political dissidents by petitioning to have them released or securing exit permits from concentration camps. A file is being prepared at Yad Vashem, the Holocaust memorial and research centre in Israel, to put him forward for the Righteous Among the Nations award. Others to have been given the honour . include Oskar Schindler, the German industrialist who is believed to . have saved more than 1,200 Jews during the Second World War by employing . them in his factories. Irena . Steinfeldt, director of the Righteous Among The Nations department at . Yad Vashem, is carrying out research into the actions of Albert Goering. According . to William Hastings Burke's book about the case, Thirty Four, he was a . defiant anti-Nazi who smuggled Jews across the borders, funneled aid to . refugees across Europe and did everything in his power to undermine his . brother's regime. Yad Vashem is examining evidence including testimony from US interrogators, Gestapo reports and statements from people he rescued. On one occasion he is said to have asked for the release of a doctor called Dachau, but confusion resulted in two men with the same surname being set free. During the war he worked as export . director of the Skoda Works in Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia. At the time . it was a major arms manufacturer. Conflict: Albert Goering, left, was said to have done everything in his power to undermine the Nazi regime of which his brother Hermann Goering, right, was a senior leader . At the end of the war, he spent two years in prison as he tried to convince the Allies of his innocence. He was put on trial in Prague for his wartime role, but acquitted following testimony from factory workers. His efforts included compiling a list of 34 people he had saved. He was eventually released but found it hard to rid himself of the stigma of his family name and became a depressed alcoholic. Albert Goering was married to a Czech woman named Mila, with whom he had a daughter. The couple were divorced after the war and he married his housekeeper shortly before he died. Hermann Goering, the commander-in-chief of the Luftwaffe, committed suicide by taking cyanide in 1946, the night before he was due to be hanged for war crimes.

A man died after suffering massive burns from a fire that ripped through his terraced home when he lit the sitting room fire. Jeffrey Chadwick, 27, did not realise that the gas canister in his back yard was leaking, causing fumes to drift throughout his house whenever the kitchen door or window was opened. Soon after he turned on his gas fire in September last year, vapours wafting through his house caused a huge 'flash' blast which ripped through his property. Jeffery Chadwick, 29, died 11 days after fire ripped through his terraced home in Nelson, Lancashire . Today an inquest into Mr Chadwick's death heard how he told firefighters who came to the scene that the gas canister 'was supposed to be empty'.Â  He died in hospital 11 days later. Mr Chadwick, who shared the terraced house in Nelson, Lancashire, with his father, had kept the cylinder behind the house for up to three years. He was not aware that the Calor Gas container, of the type used for barbecues, still had gas in it and that its valve was partially open, allowing deadly butane gas to seep through the house. The fumes - which are heavier than air - . remained at ground level and wafted across the yard and through the terraced property when a door or window was opened. The inquest in Burnley heard how on the evening of September 7, Mr Chadwick switched on the fire in his sitting room. At 7.40pm, a spark from the fire . suddenly ignited flames which tore across the living room carpet, . through the kitchen and out into the yard, where some rubbish caught . fire. Mr Chadwick was at home in Nelson by himself when the accident happened last autumn, and neighbours called 999 . Mr Chadwick, who was thought to be outside in the yard when the explosion happened, suffered 46 per cent burns to his torso, upper body, and face. Firefighters were summoned by neighbours who reported hearing an explosion, and they found Mr Chadwick hobbling out of the house. Watch manager David Robinson said: 'He had no clothes on the top half of his body, his hair was singed and there were burns to both his arms. 'I think he was in shock but was talking relatively coherently. 'He said: ""It was supposed to be empty"" and ""There wasn't supposed to be anything in it"".' Mr Chadwick was initially taken to . Royal Blackburn Hospital before being transferred to a specialist burns . unit at Pinderfields Hospital, Wakefield. He died on September 18 from . respiratory distress syndrome, a lung infection caused by reaction to . traumatic injuries such as burns. Fire incident intelligence officer . Steve Green, who investigated the accident, said the valve on the . canister had been loosened, allowing the gas to be sucked into Mr Chadwick's home. He said: 'Butane gas would have been . released. This type of gas is twice as heavy as air and acts very much . like water, staying close to the ground and finding any available space. 'It . flows like water until it finds an ignition source. The flames flashed . back from the lounge, into the kitchen and into the yard. 'It wouldn't have taken a lot of gas . to spread quickly through the house. The canister itself did not . explode, it was the released gas. 'For it to ignite it would have . needed to be in concentrations of between two and 10 per cent and would . need to come into contact with a naked flame, in this case the gas fire in the lounge. 'There will have been a sudden flash explosion which swept through the house and yard.' Mr Green said that Mr Chadwick's bath was running upstairs when firefighters arrived, which indicated that he was looking to cool his burns down after the explosion. Recording a verdict of accidental . death, East Lancashire coroner Richard Taylor said: 'It doesn't explain . why the valve was open. It was a very very tragic accident in the most . unusual circumstances.' After the hearing a neighbour said: . 'There was a massive bang that evening and the fire engines were there . within a couple of minutes. 'I saw Jeffrey on the street, he was shirtless and being attended to. It was a shock when we heard he had died.' After the inquest, fire chiefs said that people who handled butane and propane gas should treat . it with care.","Jeffery Chadwick, 27,suffered 46 per cent burns and died 11 days later .

Fiona Salmon, 40, is guilty of cruelty towards seven residents of a care home in St Ives, Cornwall . A care home bully who tormented vulnerable care home residents was found guilty of seven charges of cruelty today. Fiona Salmon sat on one woman's legs to stop her getting out of bed, and washed another woman's face with a flannel so hard she made her nose bleed. This afternoon a jury took just two-and-a-half hours to find her guilty on all seven charges of ill-treating or neglecting residents suffering from insufficient mental capacity. Salmon, 40, committed the offences at Cornwallis Care Services' nursing home in St. Ives, Cornwall between June 2011 and January 2012. Phillip Lee, prosecuting, told Truro Crown Court that Salmon's crimes ranged from pinching and slapping to rough handling. He said Salmon also called residents names such as 'dirty b****' and told them their breath stank of dog mess. Salmon, from Camborne, Cornwall, listened in the dock as former colleague Joanna Clarke gave evidence against her. Miss Clarke told the court: 'One morning Fiona washed a resident's face with a flannel so hard that it caused a nosebleed. 'I also saw her squeezing talcum powder into a woman's face and she called her a grubby b****. 'While helping another patient she flung her on her bed so hard she hit her head on a metal railing, making her cry. 'She also pinched a patient's upper arm and sprayed deodorant in her face.' Miss Clarke added: 'Her behaviour was humiliating and there was no compassion. 'She spoke to them disrespectfully, as if they were not worth anything and as if they were an inconvenience.' Truro Crown Court heard that Fiona Salmon pinched a patient's upper arm and gave another a nosebleed . Fiona Salmon is no longer working at Cornwallis Care Services' nursing home in St Ives, Cornwall . Miss Clarke admitted to the court that she didn't tell anyone of the abuse because she feared no-one would believe her, before eventually telling a friend's mother who told the police. Another colleague, Stephanie Fielding, spoke from behind a screen to describe the horrors that Salmon put the elderly residents through over the seven-month period. She revealed how Salmon once dug her nails into a patient's skin, drawing blood. She added: 'One night we were putting a patient on her bed but she did not want to stay. Fiona decided to sit on her legs to force her. 'She cried out and shouted at Fiona to get off as she was hurting her but she just laughed and carried on for a couple of minutes until I told her to get off. A colleague told the court that Salmon's behaviour was 'humiliating, and there was no compassion' 'Fiona also swore and told a patient her breath smelt like dog mess. The patient said she was sorry.' She also said that when she was washing two male patients, Salmon made a lewd suggestion to her. Salmon listened as another colleague described her as 'cruel'. Jo Martin, defending, argued Miss Clarke was jealous of Salmon because she had been offered day shifts. She also said Miss Fielding instigated the accusations because she fell out with Salmon over a personal matter. Salmon will be sentenced at Truro Crown Court on May 10.

A man who attacked his pregnant girlfriend and tried to push her over a banister when he 'saw red' escaped jail after the court heard how he struggled to cope with stressful situations. Edward Gaunt, 20, slapped Sarah Bolland, held a knife to her stomach and threatened to harm her unborn child during a series of rows last December. But despite labelling his crimes 'appalling', a judge handed Gaunt a suspended sentence, allowing him to walk free from court. No longer together: Edward Gaunt attacked his then girlfriend Sarah Bolland when she was pregnant . The . most vicious of his assaults was sparked when his girlfriend demanded . to know if Gaunt had been taking drugs, and looked at his arms for . needle marks, a hearing at Chesterfield Magistrates' Court was told. The court heard how Gaunt had been in a five-year 'on-off' relationship with Miss Bolland, which had featured some violent episodes. Sarah Haslam, prosecuting, said Gaunt seemed happy about his partner's pregnancy until the night of December 27 last year, when he 'saw red' and attacked her. Gaunt, 20, struck both sides of her head with his hand and pulled her to the floor.Â  He then tried to push her over a banister rail and spat at her as she walked downstairs. Mrs Haslam said trouble flared again at 10am the next day after Ms Bolland asked if he was using amphetamine. The court heard she looked for needle marks on his arm and he became angry. Mrs Haslam said: 'He hit her around the head many times and he grabbed her throat. He knelt on her stomach and slapped her across the face. The judge told Gaunt, pictured left, that he had behaved in a 'vicious and malicious' way towards Miss Bolland . 'He pushed a sharp knife against her stomach, saying he would put it through her and her baby.' She added: 'He said: ""I hope you will ring me later and give me some good news that the baby has died"".' Gaunt, from Buxton, Derbyshire, was arrested and claimed that Ms Bolland was 'spiteful and hormonal' and that she had made up the allegations. He appeared in court in custody, having been on remand in Nottingham prison for 24 days, and admitted the assaults at Buxton. 'It was appalling treatment of someone carrying your child. It beggars belief,' Deputy District Judge Andrew Davison told him. He said Gaunt had behaved in a 'vicious and malicious' way and had been wrongly charged with common assault when he should have faced the more serious offence of assault causing actual bodily harm. Mr Davison imposed a 20-week jail term but suspended it for two years. He ordered Gaunt to pay Â£500 compensation to Ms Bolland, who suffered bruising to her head. A restraining order, banning Gaunt from contacting her for an indefinite period, was also imposed, plus a two-year probation supervision order, including drug treatment and domestic abuse programmes. Defending, Rebecca Wrack said: 'He deeply regrets his behaviour and doesn't seek to excuse it. The relationship has now come to an end and she has moved out of the area.' She told the court a friend of Gaunt had died a week before the offence. He struggled to cope with stressful situations and he took amphetamine and reacted badly when confronted about it.","Edward Gaunt, 20, of Buxton, knelt on Sarah Bolland's stomach in row .

A lorry driver who drove into a young girl as she tried to cross a road on her bike was texting a friend seconds beforehand. Darren Foster, 38, crushed Hope Fennell, 13, under the wheels of his HGV and then desperately deleted text messages he had sent from his phone in a bid to cover his tracks while the child lay dying. Yesterday the lorry driver from Derby admitted both dangerous driving and perverting the course of justice in relation to deleting the texts at Birmingham Crown Court. Hope was declared dead at the scene of the accident, which happened on Kings Heath High Street, Birmingham, at 5pm on November 7, 2011. She had been trying to cross the road on a pedestrian crossing. Passers-by desperately tried to save her life as she lay on the ground but their attempts were in vain. Foster was interviewed by police after the rush-hour accident and was charged with dangerous driving last July. A spokesman for West Midlands Police said: 'Hope was trying to cross a busy junction on her bike when she was in collision with the lorry at just after 5pm on Monday 7 November. 'Foster was interviewed under caution after the incident and subsequently charged with dangerous driving in July 2012. 'He will be sentenced on 2 April, but in the meantime he has been given an interim disqualification.' Last summer Hope's mother Nazan, 46, from Kings Heath, Birmingham, launched a campaign to improve safety measures at the spot where her daughter died. She said: 'I believe I have lost my child because safety was not taken as seriously as it should be.

Mrs Fennell chained a bike similar to the one Hope, who attended nearby Queensbridge School, was riding to a lamppost nearby and turned it into a shrine which still stands over a year after her death.

A judge has set aside an elderly womanâs will because of pressure applied by her âforcefulâ son. Two years before she died aged 98, Jessica Schrader, changed her will from leaving her house to her two sons to leaving it just to one of them. The will she wrote in 2006 superseded one she had written in 1990, in which she left her Essex farmhouse to be shared equally between her sons Nick Schrader, now 62, and Bill Schrader, now 60. Nick Schrader, left, was ordered to share his late mother's Essex farm with his younger brother Bill, right . Today, a judge at London's High Court pronounced in favour of the 1990 will, saying that the 'violent' and 'irrational' older brother had used 'undue influence' on his mother to get her to make the second will in which she left the whole house to him. Farmer's son Bill Schrader, 60, had challenged the new will on the basis that his mother did not have proper capacity, did not know what she was doing and was improperly influenced to leave Southend Farm House, near Billericay, to his older brother. After a four-day hearing, Mr Justice Mann pronounced in favour of the 1990 will, restoring the younger brotherâs half-share of the value of the house - worth about Â£160,000. He also ordered Nick Schrader to pay the costs of the 'regrettable' action, estimated at around Â£110,000. Today, the judge said that the brothers were at such loggerheads that Nick Schrader felt 'hatred' towards Bill Schrader, who ran a car-breaking business on land next to the house.Â  He said that he younger did not seem to feel quite as strongly. The court heard that part of the explanation might be Nick Schrader's view - denied by his younger brother - that Bill Schrader had an affair with his brotherâs first wife and behaved inappropriately, stopping short of a full affair, with his second. Southend Farm in Essex, seen here next to Bill Schrader's car-breaking business, will now be sold . The judge said: 'He [Nick Schrader] is, in my view, somewhat obsessed with his feelings towards his brother and a feeling that they were treated unequally by their parents throughout their lives. 'As far as I can see this perception of inequality is unjustified. 'What has happened is that Nick has made different life choices and different choices towards the acquisition of cash as opposed to land.' Nick Schrader was also a man 'of violent character' who received a prison sentence for assaulting the partner of his former wife at a wedding in 2004, said the judge. He had also shoved shears through an open car window towards his brotherâs head or neck, though he did not make contact, and been verbally abusive to customers visiting Bill Schraderâs vehicle repair business. 'His behaviour was bad verging on the irrational on a very significant number of occasions,' the judge added. The judge said that Jessica Schrader was remarkably alert and active until becoming frail after a fall in May 2005. But she still understood the world, and the people around her, and clearly had testamentary capacity and understood the will. However, undue influence on the part of Nick Schrader, who gave up his job to move in to look after his mother, was established, he added. In pronouncing against the 2006 will and in favour of the 1990 version, Nick Schraderâs personality was an important factor, said the judge. 'He was a forceful man with a forceful physical presence. I repeat that I find there was no question of physical abuse, or even of real emotional abuse. 'I am sure that he will have experienced frustrations in looking after his elderly mother which many less volatile personalities will experience.Â  However, the fact is he was a powerful personality and his mother was much more vulnerable. 'Nickâs keenly felt view that he had not been treated equally with his brother is an important point. 'He would be more inclined to try to even things up. I think that he did so, by way of suggestion to his mother. 'He had clear views about his entitlement to his ""inheritance"".' The judge also said that Nick Schrader was instrumental in sowing in his motherâs mind the desirability of his having the house, and in doing so he took advantage of her vulnerability. He added: 'It is not possible to determine any more than that the precise form of the pressure, or its occasion or occasions, but it is not necessary to do so. 'I am satisfied that this will results from some form of undue influence.' The farmhouse will now be sold and the older brother's share is expected to be swallowed up in the costs of the legal action.","Jessica Schrader died in 2008, leaving Essex farmhouse to older son Nick .

Matt Frost, 29, from Cornwall, loved working as a cattle farmer during his 52-jobs a year challenge . A shop manager who decided he wanted to find a career he loved rather than tolerated is trying a different job every week - for a year. Matt Frost, 29, made the life-changing decision after he was forced to take time off following an accident at work when a box of metal brackets fell on his head. During months of recuperation at home in Cornwall, he realised that much as he liked his colleagues, there must be more to life. Mr Frost told MailOnline: 'I'd worked in shops ever since leaving college at 17, and during the time I was recuperating, I just wondered if this was what I wanted to be doing for the rest of my life. 'I realised I didn't just want to enjoy evenings and weekends - I wanted to enjoy what I did for a living. 'As I wasn't sure what I wanted to do, I thought I would try different things.' Quite a lot of different things: Mr Frost decided to try 52 various jobs, for five days each, for the whole of 2013. He also thought this would be a good way to earn money for charity, and has vowed to give each week's pay to The Prince's Trust, which helps disadvantaged young people.Â  So far, he has raised more than Â£2,500. Mr Frost, who lives at home in Liskeard, Cornwall, with his father photographer father Rob, 57, mother Pauline, 55, and sister Michelle, 27, both of whom work in supermarkets. He said his family have been supportive of his challenge and hope it leads to him finding a job he will love. The jobs have taken him across southern England, throughout his home county and as far as London - with temporary employment also offered later this year in Northern Ireland and parts of Scotland. The week Mr Frost spent working as a stuntman was difficult and painful, but he says he is loving the variety . It tooks months of recuperation after an accident to make Mr Frost realise he wanted to do something else . Despite having to dip into his bank overdraft and cut back on his usual Mothering Sunday extravagance, the 29-year-old said he is determined to see the challenge through to the end of the year. 'It's tough living on virtually no disposable income, so you can certainly say I'm giving my overdraft a run for its money,' he said. 'But I knew this was going to be tricky when I started, so it has not come as a shock. 'I'm trying to cut back personal costs as much as possible, so I am accepting lifts from people and crashing on sofas if I am working away from home. Jack of all trades: Matt Frost will be well-placed to choose a career he loves by the end of the year . 'There's a group of mates I haven't seen since this has started and I'm afraid Mum got something a little cheap for Mother's Day. 'I've written my fair share of IOUs too, but that's all part of the challenge for me and I am loving it.' Placements have varied from hard labour to mentally exhausting office roles, and Mr Frost has also had to spend his free time setting up future placements, travel and living arrangements. He said: 'I was a stunt man for a week, which involved a lot of me being used as a padded punch bag. It was great fun, but a bit of a relief when the bell went at the end of the day. Positive attitude: Despite having to be the new boy every Monday for a year, Mr Frost is thriving on his challenge . Exhausting but satisfying: The week he spent working as a cattle farmer was one of Mr Frost's favourites . 'This week I have been working with children with special needs in Plymouth, which has been incredible too, for different reasons. 'And my time at the Prince's Trust was completely eye-opening - I have been able to see where the money I have raised is going, and seeing the real-life accounts of people who are genuinely struggling to get by.' He says the jobs he has most enjoyed so far have been the outdoor, physical ones - beef-farming and working as a blacksmith left him exhausted but happy at the end of each day. He also enjoyed jobs with creativity: 'When I worked as a blacksmith I loved thinking I'd made a metal gate which might last for years and years.' There are still 41 weeks of the challenge left, and potential employers are asked to get in touch if they can help . Mr Frost, who is now in week 11 of his challenge, says even if he finds his dream job, he will finish his challenge before pursuing it. 'Everyone asks what I will do if I find my ideal job early on, but I've set myself the challenge and I'm going to stick to it,' he said. 'Parts of it are hard - showing up somewhere new every Monday, always being the new person, and having to get to know people - but I'm enjoying the discipline and the opportunities this is bringing me, and I feel so lucky to be doing it.' Mr Frost added: 'Obviously, all my wages are going to charity, so if there are some high-paying employers out there, I'd love to hear from them.'

Abandon ship: The Uncontrollable Urge, pictured in a similar race in 2006, broke apart in high tides and howling winds on Friday night . The coastguard caught the dramatic rescue using night-vision goggles and infrared camera, which help find those in the water. Mr Williams and five other crew . members were hoisted into a helicopter and flown to hospital.They were treated and later released. The 36-year-old . was a member of the Silver Gate Yacht Club in San Diego, where the . Uncontrollable Urge is docked, its commodore said.

The Islands Race website listed James Gilmore as the owner of the Uncontrollable Urge. Gilmore tweeted on Friday that he was taking the new boat on its first race, and noted that the forecast called for 25-knot winds. 'Gonna see what this boat can do!' he posted. Chuck Hope said the Uncontrollable Urge was known within the sailboat racing circuit and that its crew and skipper were experienced. He said stormy conditions in the open seas caused equipment failures for two other boats, forcing their crews to drop from the race. The Uncontrollable Urge crew radioed that the boat's rudder failed. The overnight, 139-nautical-mile race began in Newport Harbor in Orange County on Friday and was to take participants around Catalina and San Clemente islands before finishing off in San Diego's Point Loma.

And while Michael Jackson, Marilyn Monroe and Adolf Hitler all had at least one, the latest celebrity to apparently get her own body double was revealed today - as six-year-old Suri Cruise. The daughter of Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes was allegedly replaced by a doppelganger during a day out in New York in a daring bid to hoodwink pursuing paparazzi, according to a local newspaper.

A children's playground at a smart new housing development has been sealed off for months - because it is too brightly coloured. The play area was a major attraction to families who paid up to Â£500,000 for properties on the Corinium Via estate in the Cotswolds. But when it was completed last summer, a handful of locals complained that the size and colour scheme of the playground were not 'in keeping' with the upmarket area. Closed: Families living locally have said the promised playground was the reason they bought a house there . Elizabeth Lloyd with son Jonty, two, and daughter Isabella, four, says 'The only people complaining are those without children' Developer Redrow Homes erected a metal fence around the site and vowed to repaint the swings and climbing frames, which are primarily red, green, blue and yellow. But the area has remained sealed off ever since - and Redrow is now seeking planning permission to change the colour scheme and relocate some of the equipment. Elizabeth Lloyd, 33, who lives opposite the park, said her four-year-old daughter and two-year-old son are desperate to play on the equipment. She said: 'People have complained that it was too brightly coloured and not in keeping with the local colour scheme. 'Redrow offered to take it away and paint it dark green. Then people started complaining it was too big and that it could distract drivers going past. 'It's ridiculous, the only people complaining are people who don't have children. Not 'Cotswolds' enough? This image shows the play equipment with the Corinium Via estate behind it . Elizabeth Lloyd says her children Jonty and Isabella are 'desperate' to play in the boarded up playground . Children keep out! The appealing-looking playground has high barriers around it to stop children playing there . 'My husband and I bought our house specifically because it was going to overlook the park, but I'm sick of staring at an iron fence.' Shelleigh Bailey, 39, who lives nearby, said she blames snobbery in the affluent area. She said: 'Someone's complained about it being too bright.Â  I would understand it if it was some cheap metal play park, but it's actually very nice. 'I think it's not seen as ""Cotswolds"" enough. It's a shame for the kids because they have waited a long time to play on it.' The Redrow homes on the Corinium Via estate, at Kingshill on the edge of Cirencester, Gloucestershire, were completed in August last year. Families living on the estate say their children are 'miserable' looking at the fenced-off play area . The developer, Redrow, says it is waiting for planning permission to repaint and move some of the equipment . Smart Gloucestershire estate: Residents who have bought at Corinium Via paid up to Â£500,000 for their houses . Many of the properties are finished in traditional Cotswold stone in keeping with the local landscape. Redrow set aside half an acre for a play area, which would be built once construction was nearing completion on the rest of the site. The park contains slides, swings, rockers, monkey bars, a climbing frame and a cargo net. But before it could even open, some locals complained that it was too big, too bright and too visible to passing traffic on the main road. The developer agreed to repaint the equipment dark green and left the construction barriers in place - where they still remain today. Elizabeth Lloyd, who moved into a four-bedroomed Â£450,000 house with her husband Bruce in December 2011, said she would now rather have the park removed completely. She said: 'The people who are complaining about it don't have children. 'My kids have sat and looked at this for the best part of a year. It's pretty miserable. 'We need parks and spaces for children. At the end of the day it's a park and we all bought homes knowing it would be built.' Looks like fun: The playground at the residential estate has been fenced off since last summer . The play area was built by developer Redrow to go with the housing estate near Cirencester in affluent Gloucestershire . Redrow Homes has now applied for planning permission to change the colour and move some of the play equipment. But Gavin Hill, Technical Director for Redrow Homes, denied that the area is bigger than permitted. He said: 'Due to concerns raised by some residents over the new playground's colour scheme at the opening has been delayed. 'In response to the complaints, Redrow has agreed with residents and Cotswold District Council to adjust the colour of the equipment and move a few play items further away from dwellings. 'Redrow has submitted new plans to Cotswold District Council which are expected to be approved by the end of next week. 'Once we receive approval the remedial work will commence and the play area opened without further delay.' Still unused: Families at the Corinium Via estate are angry at those who have complained the play equipment is 'too bright' Cotswold District Council spokesman Bob McNally said: 'Cotswolds District Council has responded to objections that were brought to us by some residents whose homes are near or overlook the play area. 'At the request of several residents, it was agreed collectively that the opening of the play area would be put on hold until their concerns were considered further. 'One of the residents' concerns was about the bright colours of the equipment - which are not in line with the approved plan conditions for the play area. 'The developer has agreed to address this as soon as the formal planning approval for relocating the equipment is granted.' Playground designer and manufacturer Andrew Lane said the issue of people without children complaining about playgrounds was a common one. Mr Lane, who is operations director of Sutcliffe Play in Pontefract, said bright colours helped children who were visually impaired navigate themselves around playgrounds. He said: 'Inclusivity should be designed into play areas to promote integration of able and less able children.Â  Frankly, this playground is one of the less colourful options, being predominantly timber construction.' Mr Lane said a similar playground would cost around Â£25,000-Â£30,000 to build, and said it was 'not unusual to have residents who don't have children complaining about children enjoying themselves'. He added: 'Sometimes they even invoke the Human Rights Act saying that the children's playground affects their right to peace and tranquility.'","The play area was built next to Corinium Via estate in Gloucestershire .

The man who secretly filmed Mitt Romney's damning remarks about 'the 47 per cent' in the run-up to the presidential election is finally coming forward today. The film-maker, whose tape caused Romney's campaign to falter and in part cost him the White House, has been revealed as a bartender working at the dinner for wealthy Republican donors. He admitted that the only reason he had a camera with him at the fundraiser last May in Boca Raton, Florida was because he assumed Romney would meet staff and allow photos as a thank you - which the candidate did not. Scroll down for videos . Game-changer: Former presidential candidate Mitt Romney's remarks about the '47 per cent' sank his hopes for the White House after a secretly-filmed tape was released online . In the video, which surfaced online last September, Romney argues that '47 per cent' of Americans would vote for Obama 'no matter what' because they were 'victims dependent on government'. Romney said: 'All right, there are 47 per cent who are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe that government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you name it. 'That that's an entitlement. And the government should give it to them. And they will vote for this president no matter what.' The bartender said he felt it was his 'civic duty' to make the tape public and is now allowing his identity to be revealed on Wednesday night onÂ MSNBC. The much-anticipated interview will . take place on the Ed Show and as host Ed Schultz said: 'No matter what . Mitt Romney does for the rest of his life, he will probably be best . remembered for this.' Leaked: James Carter, an opposition researcher, said he found the video online and put reporters from the left-leaning U.S. website Mother Jones in touch with an unnamed individual who had shot the footage . Woops! The resulting outcry over Romney's remarks is still regarded as one of the main reasons why the Republican lost the race to the White House . The . man who made the tape has so far remained hidden. All that is known is he works with a prestigious Florida catering . company who take cater of high-end events. Connected: James Carter, grandson of former president Jimmy Carter, made sure the Romney tape received widespread attention . The catering worker told New York Magazine that he had worked another political fundraiser at the same hotel where Bill Clinton was a speaker. After the retired president made his remarks, he came into the kitchen and thanked the waiting staff, posing for pictures and signing autographs. Romney, on the other hand, did not speak to staff and despite telling his high-paying guests that the dinner was off the record - he did not address waiters, bartenders and busboys at all. The only name which has been publicly connected with the Romney tape so far is political researcher James Carter - grandson of former Democratic president Jimmy Carter. He said that he found the video online and put reporters from the left-leaning U.S. website Mother Jones in touch with the individual whoÂ  shot the footage. At the time, the disclosure that he was involved fueled speculation the project to embarrass Romney was part of a liberal stitch-up.

Michelle Obama, VP Joe Biden and former . Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had their addresses and other sensitive information posted online. BeyoncÃ©, Britney Spears and Kim Kardashian were also exposed by the site - although it is unclearÂ  how the information was . obtained or why these individuals were selected.

While government officials often have to disclose details on their finances - and celebrity divorces sometimes feature public financial data - the information posted online exceeds those disclosures. Social Security numbers are rarely included in public records anymore because they can be used for identity theft. In December, a man who hacked email accounts belonging to A-listers including Scarlett Johansson, Mila Kunis and Christina Aguilera was sent to prison for a decade. Christopher Chaney, 36, pleaded guilty to nine felony counts earlier this year - including identity theft, wiretapping, and unauthorized access - after he leaked nude and revealing photos of the women online. Chaney, of Jacksonville, Florida, was arrested in 2011 as part of a year-long investigation of celebrity hacking that authorities dubbed 'Operation Hackerazzi'. The depth of his hacking - which kept the unemployed Chaney glued to his computer screen for days at a time - enabled him to witness exchanges between celebrities, their family members and their doctors. In all he was accused of illegally accessing the private information of around 50 stars with virtually no technical computer training. The 36-year-old also admitted to being privy to information about male stars who were hiding the fact they were gay for the sake of their careers. Prosecutors said Chaney illegally accessed the email accounts between November 2010 and October 2011. Nude photos Johansson had taken of herself were later posted on the Internet. Johansson told Vanity Fair that the photos were meant for Ryan Reynolds, her ex-husband who is now married to Blake Lively.","Officials targeted included Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden, FBI Director Robert Mueller and LAPD Chief Charlie Beck .

Production of Golden Wonder's The Nation's Noodles will move from China to Leeds . A British food producer is moving its production of instant noodles from China to Britain after discovering it can make them just as cheaply at home. Symington's, which makes Golden Wonder's dehydrated The Nation's Noodles, Normous Noodles, Naked Noodles, and Mug Shots, is cancelling its contracts with factories in Guangzhou, on the banks of the Pearl River, and Hangzhou, and preparing to manufacture them in Britain. The Leeds-based  firm says rising wages in China, plus the increasing cost and inconvenience of shipping the noodles back here, are behind its decision to move noodle production to the UK after seven years. Henrik Pade, business development . manager at Symington's, said: 'We can produce for roughly the same cost . today in Yorkshire as we are out of China. 'If you go back in time, it would probably have been 30-35 per cent less [in China].' He also told the FT . the decision to make the noodles at a new factory in Leeds was also . influenced by the need for quicker response times. The move by Symington's is the latest . example of 're-shoring' - the opposite of 'off-shoring' - whereby production is relocated back home from . China because it is cheaper to do so. One British manufacturer is selling . rice cookers to China, while Toyota produces cars in its factory near . Derby for export to Japan. The strengthening of Asian markets . contrasts with the weakening of the pound, making home-based production . more attractive than ever to UK-based manufacturers. Wages have been steadily rising in China . over the last decade, meaning it is no longer the obvious choice for . those looking to make things cheaply. Symington's is moving instant noodle production from a factory in China's Guangzhou, pictured, to Yorkshire . Leeds, with its City Hall shown here, will benefit from 50 new jobs when the noodle factory opens in August . Five years ago, Symington's brought the packaging of the noodle pots to Britain from China, and other companies are following suit. Stoke-on-Trent MP Tristram Hunt says more British companies are looking at bringing their manufacturing back to the UK, and says it could be the start of Britain's 'reindustrialisation'. The move by Symington's will be a blow to China but a boost to the local economy in Leeds, with the creation of around 50 jobs when the noodle factory opens in August. A survey by UK manufacturers' association EEF in 2011 showed that one in seven was bringing some work back home from overseas. Population: With 12.78m residents, Guangzhou is China's third largest city . Language: Half the residents speak Cantonese, the others speak Mandarin . Climate: Humid and sub-tropical, with wet summers and mild, dry winters.Â  It last snowed there in 1893 . Landmarks: Guangdong Olympic Stadium, the Canton Tower, Guangzhou Opera House .

A couple who found their son after he was abandoned as a baby in a New York subway station have described the chance encounter that brought the family together as their 'destiny'. Danny Stewart was returning home to his partner Peter Mercurio in August 2000 when he saw what he thought was a doll lying in the corner of the  14th Street A/C/E subway station in Manhattan. When he glanced back, he saw the little legs wriggling and realized it was a baby boy wrapped in a sweatshirt. Scroll down for video .

Mr Mercurio rushed to the scene where authorities had already taken charge of the day-old child who had his umbilical cord still attached. For several months there was wall-to-wall media coverage as authorities searched for the mother of the boy, who had been named baby Daniel 'ACE' Doe. When after four months no one had come forward to claim the child, Mr Stewart was asked to appear in court to testify as to how he found the child. At the December proceedings, the judge suddenly asked if the couple would be interested in adopting the little boy.

A police officer accused of plotting to kidnap, cook and eat women, including his own wife, has been convicted of conspiracy. Valle bowed his head and looked . teary-eyed when the verdict was announced on Tuesday before hugging his lawyer at Manhattan federal court. Prosecutors said 'cannibal cop' Valle plotted with others he met on fetish websites . to abduct, torture and eat women he knew. The FBI arrested 28-year-old NYPD officer Gilberto Valle last year based on a tip by his now-estranged wife Kathleen Mangan. Scroll down for video . Sinister: A court sketch on Tuesday of former New York City officer Gilberto Valle, the 'Cannibal Cop', as he was found guilty of conspiracy over his plot to kidnap, cook and eat women . Father: An undated photo submitted as evidence shows Gilberto Valle with his daughter. Valle is accused of conspiracy to kidnap a woman and unauthorized use of a law enforcement database to help build a list of potential targets . Valle's mother, Elizabeth, shook her head as the verdict was rendered. 'I'm in shock and want to be left alone,' she said after her son was led away, adding: 'This is going to kill my mother.' She also said that her son's estranged wife 'perjured herself', according to the New York Post. Defense attorney Julia Gatto said outside court: 'It's a devastating verdict for us. We poured our hearts and souls into this. 'The jury was unable to get past the thoughts. Obviously, the case involved thoughts that were unusual and bizarre and frankly very ugly.' She added that it was a 'dangerous prosecution when we start opening our minds and prosecuting what's in our brains and not what's in the real world'. Valle's lawyers said he was just fantasizing and had no intention of harming anyone. He also was found guilty of accessing a national crime database. Valle will be kept in solitary confinement until he is sentenced on June 19. New York City's accused 'cannibal cop' crossed the line from fantasy to reality in plotting to kidnap, cook and eat women, a federal prosecutor told a jury in closing arguments last Thursday. Burden: Elizabeth Valle, mother of Gilberto Valle, leaving Manhattan Federal Court following his conviction on Tuesday, saying her son's wife 'perjured herself'. The convict's father Gilberto was also at court today (right) Response: Julia Gatto, attorney for the disgraced NYPD cop, speaks to the media following his guilty verdict outside the Manhattan Federal Court in New York . Support: Former New York City police officer Gilberto Valle is hugged by his lawyer after being found guilty as the pair broke down in tears . Defense attorney Julia Gatto countered . in summations that her client was playing a fantasy role online, and . told jurors 'we don't convict human beings because of ugly thoughts ... even if they are police officers'. In a case featuring grisly testimony, NYPD worker Gilberto Valle, 28, has pleaded not guilty to a charge of conspiring to kidnap and a charge of improperly accessing a law enforcement database to gather personal information about potential targets. The jury of six women and six men deliberated for several hours after closing arguments without reaching a verdict. They resumed deliberations on Friday morning at the District Court in Manhattan. Assistant U.S. Attorney Hadassa Waxman . said in her closing argument that Valle was at one point engaged in . fantasy, but that his intentions had grown more sinister. 'Discovered': Kathleen Mangan, 28, pictured with her husband, was offered up to a Pakistani man to be cooked and eaten . Disgust: Kathleen Mangan testifies at the federal trial of her ex-husband last month after she found disturbing messages he had written about torturing and eating her to a stranger . Wreck: Valle broke down in tears during closing arguments last week as his attorney described how his wife and daughter left him after the woman learned of his depraved online conversations about cannibalism of which she was a target victim . Pointing to his extensive online research on kidnapping, making chloroform and cooking women, she said: 'These are real searches conducted to carry out real research to kidnap real women.' 'This case is not about freedom of speech, or freedom of thought,' Waxman told jurors. Fetish websites 'are not on trial here. This is about Gilberto Valle's plans to hurt young women'. But defense attorney Gatto compared Valle's online activity to Orson Welles' 'War of the Worlds' radio broadcast on October 30, 1938, which many Americans mistook for a real alien invasion. Valle's role play 'was set up to sound as real as it could, sprinkled with real details,' she said. When others come across it, Gatto said, 'panic ensues, because they think it's real ... but it's all make believe'. Shock: Kathleen Mangan, the estranged wife New York City police officer Gilberto Valle, leaves Manhattan Federal court last week . Fall from grace: Valle at his graduation went on to become a police officer but harbored dark and disturbing fantasies . Gatto told jurors that after nearly a year of fantasizing about roughly two dozen women - in many cases, discussing kidnapping with other fetishists - none of the plotters had ever met, exchanged money or committed any crimes. Valle did not testify. The trial has brought to light a macabre community of cyberspace where millions of people discuss and exchange images and video of extraordinary brutality, much of it staged. On Tuesday, defense attorneys took jurors on a video tour of DarkFetishNet.com, a website at the heart of Valle's case. In his defense: Attorney for Valle, Julia Gatto, said in court during his trial that we 'don't convict human beings because of ugly thoughts' The website functions like mainstream social media networks and its creator, Russian Web entrepreneur Sergay Merenkov, likened it to Facebook in a videotaped deposition earlier in the week. However, instead of family photos and cat videos, members share photos and videos of extreme cruelty - including rape and asphyxiation - with the goal of sexual stimulation. Members dream up brutally violent scripts, said Merenkov, who has kicked members off the site when 'it seemed not to be fantasy anymore'. Prosecutors said Valle revealed himself to be such a person when he began taking steps to act on his fantasies.

Iran has targeted a U.S. Predator drone in international airspace over the Persian Gulf, it was claimed today. Senior administration sources revealed the incident involving an Iranian military aircraft happened this week. It was the latest in Iranian efforts to thwart the U.S. military's airborne intelligence collections efforts in the region. Senior administration sources revealed Iran has targeted a U.S. Predator drone in international airspace over the Persian Gulf . Three administration officials separately confirmed details of the incident to CNN News, although the Pentagon has not publicly acknowledged it. The network said the drone was flying off Oman when Iran detected it and launched its own manned aircraft. The Iranian planes then shadowed the drone, which eventually left the area. No shots were fired. However, the officials told CNN News the U.S. is concerned about Iranian intentions in incidents like this and whether it could unintentionally trigger hostility. 'They have done this before. We are fully prepared to defend our aircraft. We were definitely in international airspace,' one of the officials said. In December 2011, a highly sensitive U.S. Sentinel drone gathering intelligence on Iran's nuclear program for the CIA was captured by Iran after it crashed. Iran has been trying to thwart the U.S. military's airborne intelligence collections efforts in the region. Pictured is an Iranian F-14 . In November, an Iranian warplane fired on a Predator over the Gulf. On Tuesday Iran's Press TV reported that its military 'identified and repelled an American U2 reconnaissance plane that was trying to intrude into Iranian airspace above the Sea of Oman.' U.S. officials say, in fact, that it was a unmanned Predator drone involved in the incident. They point out that the U2 is a high-altitude manned reconnaissance plane that Iran would find very difficult to detect. The use of U.S. drones so close to Iran remains a highly sensitive issue for U.S. military intelligence. The aircraft are capable of using sensors to gather information about Iranian military movements. There have been a number of previous encounters.","Incident happened in international airspace off the coast of Oman .

But it took David Black more than half a century to return the copy after borrowing it from an Edinburgh library as a schoolboy in 1962. Having missed the return date by a staggering 51 years, the now 60-year-old could have been charged almost Â£3,000 in late fees, but bosses at the Fine Art Library waived the fine as part of an amnesty on overdue books. Lapsed library user: David Black with the copy of Goya he borrowed from Edinburgh's Fine Art Library more than half a century ago . The copy of Dr Xavier de Salas' profile of the 18th century artist was overdue by 18,417 days when arts writer Mr Black sheepishly brought it back to the library, after spotting a notice about the week-long amnesty. Under Edinburgh City Council's late fee charge of 15 pence per day, Mr Black's fine would have amounted to Â£2762.55. Mr Black borrowed the book using a ticket belonging to his mother Winnie when he was 12 . 'When I read about the fines amnesty I . decided that I must do it, once and for all, if only to see the . librarian's face,' said Mr Black. 'It feels good to have finally returned it after all . these years.' Mr Black borrowed the book using his mother and former town councillor Winnie Black's ticket. 'I was only a schoolboy at the time and completely forgot to return it,' he said. 'It would pop up every now and again over the years but each time it would slip my mind to actually do it. 'Two years ago I even attended a . showing of the play Underneath the Lintel which is about a librarian who . sets out to find whoever anonymously returned a library book that is . 113 years overdue,' Mr Black said. The amnesty has seen over 4,000 overdue books returned to Edinburgh libraries. 'I've been a keen library user all my life, they are a great resource,' said Mr Black. 'As . a boy I drew great inspiration from this book which features a host of . Goya's illustrations; although I never intended to keep it for so long.

Councillor Richard Lewis, Edinburgh's culture and sport convener, said: 'This is a wonderful story and, of course, the Fine Art Library are very happy to have their book back after 50 years.'

The outspoken leader suggested the U.S. might have 'invented technology to spread cancer' after Argentina's president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner became the fifth Latin American to be diagnosed with the disease in a year. The late president Hugo Chavez first accused the U.S. of 'spreading cancer' among Latin American leaders in 2011 . 'We will seek the truth,' Mr Maduro told regional TV network Telesur. 'We have the intuition that our commander Chavez was poisoned by dark forces that wanted him out of the way.' Foreign scientists will be invited to join a state committee to investigate the accusation, he said. The announcement has been slammed by Venezuela's opposition party as a cynical move by Mr Maduro to capitalise on the outpouring of grief for Hugo Chavez in the run-up to fresh elections. 'Let's take the president (Chavez) away from the political debate, out of respect for his memory, his family, his supporters,' said opposition candidate Henrique Capriles' campaign chief, Henri Falcon. Nicolas Maduro, the former foreign minister and vicepresident, is regarded as Chavez's hand-picked successor and is running as the government's candidate in a snap election called for April 14. He was a close friend and ally of Chavez and was often accompanied him to Cuba for his cancer treatment. Mr Maduro is believed to be one of only a handful of insiders who knew Chavez's diagnoses which were treated as a state secret. In . December 2011 Chavez used a speech to the military and broadcast on . television to accuse the U.S. of spreading cancer among Latin American . leaders. 'Itâs very . difficult to explain, even with the law of probabilities, what has been . happening to some of us in Latin America,' Mr Chavez said.

But behind the faÃ§ade, Gloria Hunniford has revealed she is still consumed with grief at the loss of her daughter and misses her 'hundreds of times a day'. The 72-year-old TV presenter said Caron Keating's death left an agonising 'black hole' in her life that she can never hope to heal more than eight years later. The Blue Peter presenter was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1997 and died in her mother's arms, aged 41, in 2004. Gaping black hole: Gloria Hunniford said she will never recover from losing daughter Caron Keating to breast cancer in 2004 . On Sunday, Miss Hunniford will host a gala performance of 42nd street at the London Palladium in aid of the Caron Keating Foundation. She said running the charity has been a form of 'therapy' because it helps take her mind off her grief. She told the Daily Mail: 'People say time is a healer. They say the pain will fade. But you never really recover from the loss of a child. It leaves a gaping black hole in your life. You can only get a little bit better at avoiding the issue, skirting round it and not dwelling on the bad. 'Caron died eight years ago but I still think of her hundreds of times a day. If I am in a shop, I think, ""She would have loved this dress"". If I am making food, I think, ""She would have wanted a taste of this"". Smiling through the pain: The TV presenter said raising money for the Caron Keating Foundation is good therapy . 'If I am having a lovely time with my grandsons I think, ""If only she was here."" She added: 'Mother's Day is particularly hard. Caron was so thoughtful. She always gave up her time and came up with lovely gifts. 'It inevitably brings up memories, and it can be hard to cope. The first Christmas, the first birthday and the first Mother's Day without Caron were hideous. 'Thankfully I have two wonderful sons who are there for me and make it more bearable.' Miss Hunniford has written two books about her bereavement and has raised more than Â£4million for cancer charities through the Caron Keating Foundation. She said: 'The Foundation is my therapy. It keeps me busy. For me, the best way of dealing with grief is to be proactive. 'No parent should ever have to see their child die before them. It is against the natural order of things. 'Caron was so young. She was in her thirties when she was diagnosed with breast cancer. The day she was diagnosed was almost as bad as the day she died. I knew immediately life would never be the same again. It took away my carefree attitude to life in one stroke. 'As a mother you carry your baby inside you for nine months and form an incredible bond. To bury your child is indescribably painful.' Miss Keating had two sons, Charlie, now 19, and Gabriel, now 15, with her husband Russ Lindsay. Mr Lindsay was criticised for marrying her friend, TV presenter Sally Meen, 47, less than two years after her death. The couple now have a daughter of their own, Tilly, four. Proud mother of the bride: Gloria with Caron on her wedding day to Russ Lindsay . Russ went on to marry Sally Meen less than two years after Caron's death: Gloria said her daughter would have been 'grateful' her sons Charlie, left, and Gabriel, had a step-mother to look after them . But Miss Hunniford denied rumours she once fell out with Miss Meen, thanking her for being a good mother to her grandsons. She said: 'Sally was obviously in a hard position to start with.

It was a job opportunity that sounded too good to be true â sailing on a yacht through Australiaâs tropical islands in return for working as an on-board nanny, caring for the skipperâs young son. And it was too good to be true, for skipper John Collins was a serial rapist who, when police finally caught up with him and he stood before a court in Brisbane today, was convicted of assaulting seven young women on board the yacht. With his hair pulled back in a pony tail, the 74-year-old sailor was found guilty of 10 counts of rape and five of stupefying his victims in order to commit an offence. He will be sentenced early next month. Serial rapist: John Collins, 74, lured young women with the prospect of a job aboard his yacht in Queensland . Although the nationalities of the young women who fell for his promises of a life of luxury and sunshine aboard his yacht, Pan Pacific, have not been revealed, Crown Prosecutor David Nardone told Brisbane District Court at an earlier hearing that Collinsâ youngest victim was just 17. Mr Nardone said Collins deliberately targeted young women by introducing himself as a prospective employer looking for a nanny to travel with him on his boat, caring for his young son. Four of the women who fell for the lure, said Mr Nardon, were drugged by Collins before he took advantage of them. The 17-year-old was initially offered a job in 1986 as a receptionist at a motel he owned in Queensland, but when she turned up to start her employment she was told he had been called to his yacht, moored nearby, and she should meet him there. On board, they discussed terms and conditions of employment and Collins and his intended victim celebrated with a glass of champagne, although she took only âa couple of sipsâ, said the prosecutor. But as they sat in the galley, he forced himself onto her and raped her. She was able to flee and drive away in her car. Mr Nardone said the teenager did not tell anyone about the incident â until she saw a newspaper article describing a similar rape on a boat in 2000. She told police and she was able to identify Collins on a police photo board. 'Sophisticated tactics': Collins promised his victims a life of luxury on board his yacht, the Pan Pacific, in Queensland, Australia . The prosecutor said Collinsâ tactics âgrew more sophisticatedâ as he went on to hire and then rape another six young women in âremarkably similar circumstancesâ. Two of the women fell pregnant as a result of the rapes, said Mr Nardone. Collinsâ final victim was just 19 when she responded to a job advertisement placed by Collins. He picked her up and, after they stopped to buy drinks, they travelled to the yacht for dinner. When it grew late the young woman asked to take a shower and go to bed and was told she could use the shower in the main cabin â where Collins slept â because none of the other showers were working. When she came out of the shower Collins forced her onto the bed and raped her twice. Police were later able to use DNA technology to link Collins to the assault. But by then he had fled from Queensland, leaving his yacht behind. He was able to avoid police for six years, said Mr Nardone, before he was arrested in South Australia in 2006. There were, the prosecutor told the jury, âremarkable similaritiesâ in all the womenâs stories over the 14-year period Collins had offended and this was an indicator they were each telling the truth. It took the jury a week to deliberate the case before returning to the court today to find Collins guilty of most of the total of 22 charges against him. After the jury announced their decision, the aging Collins insisted he had been unfairly convicted. âI just canât believe that,â he told the court. âI am 100 per cent innocent and Iâve been found guilty of all of these crimes.â He will be sentenced on April 3.","Skipper John Collins, 74, assaulted seven young women on board his yacht .

Trusting Alan Grandfield, 75, had given Spreadbury his debit card and pin number so she could pick up bits of shopping for him - but she stole Â£6,000 from him . The elderly gentleman had been struggling to manage on his own after his wife's death and was grateful when Spreadbury volunteered to help out. But around six months later, she didn't give the card back and Mr Grandfield had to go to his bank for some money and discovered his shrinking balance. A police investigation revealed Spreadbury's 'despicable' dishonesty - she had been taking Â£1,000 a month from cashpoints in Salisbury, Wiltshire. Yet despite being the victim of a cruel crime, kindly Mr Grandfield, from Salisbury, says he feels sorry for the woman who abused his trust. The pair went shopping together at first, but he later gave Spreadbury his card and pin number. Blind pensioner Alan Grandfield says he feels no anger for the 'despicable' thief . Mr Grandfield, who lost his sight around 20 years ago, said: 'It seemed to be working all right. 'It wasn't until about six months later that the card didn't get returned to me. 'She did ask me once if she could use my card to buy four cans of lager for her husband, Nigel. 'I was very disappointed because I had put my trust in her and to be treated like that is a bit awkward.' Spreadbury was handed a nine-month suspended sentence after pleading guilty to theft at Salisbury Crown Court. She was also given a drink rehabilitation order and 100 hours of unpaid work. Her husband Nigel Spreadbury was charged with theft but died in May 2012. Mr Grandfield, whose wife died in 2008, added: 'I feel no anger towards Kim. 'In fact I feel sorry for her: she's had a very hard life. I hope she succeeds in rehab because she's basically a nice girl. 'The sad part is that her husband died halfway through all this and I couldn't go round to see her as a friend.' Detective Constable Amanda Warren, of Wiltshire Police, said: 'This was a despicable act of dishonesty. 'The victim relied on the support of his neighbours to help him with his shopping and trusted Spreadbury wtih this simple task.

California State Treasurer Bill Lockyer has had a change of heart about divorcing his wife, who recently completed a rehabilitation stint after getting caught up in a career-ending drug and sex scandal. Lockyer, 71, one of California's most powerful Democrats, and his wife of 10 years, Nadia, 'have agreed to try and reconcile' and 'work things out,' according to the treasurerâs spokesman Tom Dresslar. The treasurer filed for divorce last July citing irreconcilable differences with Nadia Lockyer, the 41-year-old former Alameda County supervisor who resigned in disgrace last April over her extramarital affair and drug abuse. Second chance: California Treasurer Bill Lockyer, left, decided not to go through with his divorce from estranged wife and ex-county supervisor Nadia Lockyer, right, after revelations of drug abuse and love affair . Legal woes: Mrs Lockyer, once a rising star in Northern California government, was forced to resign from the Board of Supervisors last year after she was arrested on drug charges and admitted to having an affair . Mrs Lockyer crashed her car into a pole and a tree the day her husband broke the news about his decision to divorce her and file for joint custody of their son, San Francisco Chronicle reported. Two months later, the married mother . of one was arrested and charged with drug violations and child . endangerment after being found in possession of meth at a relative's . home in Orange County, where she had been staying with the couple's . nine-year-old son. Lockyer has since completed a 180-day . residential drug treatment program, prompting a judge last week to allow . her to see her son, Diego, under the supervision of her husband, the . boy's aunt or another adult. The Lockyersâ child had been living with his father in Hayward while his mother was in treatment for her addiction problems. 'Heâs proud of the progress she had . made in her treatment, and they are both looking forward and not . backward,' Dressler told San Jose Mercury of Mr Lockyer's outlook on his wife's . condition. Mrs Lockyer's attorney, Allan Stokke, . last week said she is 'doing just fine' and that the judge has been . pleased with her progress. Nadia Lockyer issued a statement Thursday through her attorney, which said in part: 'I thank my husband and family for their unwavering support. 'Bill and I agree reconciliation would be best for Diego and for us, and we're committed to reaching that goal.' Nadia Lockyer's troubles began in February 2012 when she reported being sexually assaulted by a former boyfriend at a hotel in Newark, New Jersey. The 41-year-old, once a rising star in Northern California government, later admitted to having a long-term affair with Stephen Chikhani, whom she met while in a drug treatment program years earlier. Mr Lockyer, the state's former attorney general and current treasurer, helped his much younger wife with $1.6million in campaign funding when she won her supervisor seat in 2010. She resigned from the seat in April following a series of bizarre public incidents that she blamed on drug and alcohol dependency. According to the San Jose Mercury News, she said at the time she wanted to focus on her family and resolve personal issues. Mrs Lockyer said at the time: 'We're married. There's no talk of changing that. We're committed to our son.' Campaigning: Nadia Lockyer, right, won her supervisor seat in 2010 . The sordid details of the political . power couple began to leak out last February when Mrs Lockyer called . police to a hotel where she was staying to report that she had been . assaulted by her former lover, a convicted felon whom she met in rehab . for addiction. A police investigation revealed an . ongoing relationship between Mrs Lockyer and construction worker Steve . Chikhani, including explicit text messages and pictures sent between the . two but he was never charged. Mr Lockyer was also reportedly sent a sex tape of his wife and lover and Mrs Lockyer revealed that they had been together for a year before she ended the relationship. Mr Lockyer filed for divorce in July, . citing 'irreconcilable differences' in the legal papers and just hours . after being served, Mrs Lockyer ran her car off the road and hit a tree. Police received a tip last week that . led them to a house where Mrs Lockyer was staying with relatives, . district attorney's spokeswoman Farrah Emami said. The woman was not home, but officers . found methamphetamine and paraphernalia used for smoking it. Later, when . they found Mrs Lockyer, she showed 'objective signs' of meth . intoxication and she was arrested. Estranged: Bill Lockyer, pictured left, filed for divorce from wife, Nadia, right, due to her drug dependency . The other man: Steve Chikhani, a convicted felon with a history of drug arrests, reportedly made a sex tape with Mrs Lockyer after the couple met in rehab . Mrs Lockyer pleaded not guilty in . court on August 30, 2012, to a felony count of drug possession, two misdemeanor . drug charges and one misdemeanor count of child abuse, because she is . alleged to have kept the drugs in the home with her son. She was released after acknowledging she needed to check in to a drug rehab center and is due back in court on Monday. 'Nadia recognizes her error and is in . the process of doing everything possible to regain her health,' said . her attorney, Allan Stokke. Mrs Lockyer had made various accusations in the past of abandonment by her husband and that the divorce had been coming for some time. According to theÂ San Francisco Chronicle she said at the time of their divorce: 'My husband and I have differed on how to protect the family,' she said. 'I feel he has abandoned me and my child, and it's created an unsafe circumstance.' Even before her resignation from office, Mrs Lockyer publicly accused her husband of mistreatment. Split apart: Mr Lockyer cited 'irreconcilable differences' when he filed for divorce after five months of enduring the public humiliation of his wife's affair and addiction . An email that appeared to be sent from Mrs Lockyer went to a newspaper, accusing her husband of supplying her with drugs, a claim he denies. 'I simply can't bear this any longer. Goodbye to everyone,' the note read, prompting the paper to call police, fearing for her safety. At the time, Mrs Lockyer said, 'Alcoholism and addiction are diseases from which many of us suffer, and unfortunately, I have not been spared.' She later denied having sent the email and said Mr Chikhani hacked her account. However, a technology expert found the email was sent from Mrs Lockyer's phone and Mr Chikhani's lawyer said his client was at a highly controlled drug rehab facility with only supervised computer access at the time. A spokesman for Mr Lockyer denied the accusation, saying it was 'BS.' When the the couple wed in 2003, Mrs Lockyer she was four years younger than Mr Lockyer's daughter from a previous marriage. However, they immediately became a political power couple. She was the daughter of a well-known Los Angeles-area lawyer and she had made a name for herself working on political campaigns in Orange County.","Nadia Lockyer, 41, completed 180-day drug treatment program after an arrest on meth possession and child abuse .

A man who was sexually abused by a Catholic priest in Los Angeles has accused a U.S. cardinal who took part in the papal election of covering up the abuse. Michael Duran was 11 years old when he was assaulted by Father Michael Baker, who molested 23 boys during three decades in the priesthood. Mr Duran, now 40, said he 'can still feel Father Mike's beard on my face' at a news conference yesterday. The archdiocese of Los Angeles was led at the time by Cardinal Roger Mahony, who was in Rome helping to choose the pope this week, has now agreed a settlement totalling $10million to four victims. Mr Duran said Cardinal Mahony helped confessed pedophile priest Mr baker evade law enforcement by sending him out of state to a Church-run treatment center, then placing the priest back in the Los Angeles ministry. Mr Duran, a special education teacher, added that Francis's election to the papacy was 'tainted' because cardinals accused of covering up abuse had taken part in the conclave. Scroll down for video .

Mr Duran was particularly upset that Los Angeles Cardinal Roger Mahony took to Twitter and a blog to defend himself while in Rome. In one post, Mahony wrote about praying for victims of sexual abuse but also for 'those in the media who constantly malign me and my motives, attorneys who never focus on context or history in their legal matters, groups which picket me or otherwise object to me, and all those who despise me or even hate me.' Mr Duran said: 'He was tweeting and blogging over there like an innocent man, and it was really offensive to me. 'He was acting like he was the martyr, like he was the victim in all this.' More...

Mr Duran was awarded $1million in the settlement as a videotape of Cardinal Mahony being interviewed in 2010 emerged, reported CBS. The video showed Cardinal Mahony, who took part in this week's papal conclave, explaining why he did not report Baker to police after the priest told him about the abuse in the 1986 when he held the position of archbishop. The lawyer asked: 'Wouldn't that be the right thing to do?' Cardinal Mahony replied: 'Well today it would. But back then that isn't the way these matters were approached.' Instead, the Church sent Baker for therapy. But a memo, written by an official and approved by Cardinal Mahony, warned that Baker should not tell his therapist about the child abuse. Father Michael Baker, left, told Roger Mahony, right, that he had been sexually abusing boys in 1986. But Baker was allowed to serve as a priest for another 14 years and abused more boys . 'If he were to mention his problem with child abuse it would put the therapist in the position of having to report him. I think we have to be very careful,' it said. Baker went on to abuse more boys after being put back into the ministry for another 14 years and was jailed in 2007 for 10 years. He was released after serving four years of his term and is no longer in the clergy. 'I didn't do anything wrong and it's taken me a long time to come to that, but I didn't do anything wrong,' Mr Duran told CBS. 'I carried their shame for almost 30 years and I'm putting it back on them.' Mr Duran said that he holds Cardinal Mahony more responsible than Baker 'because he had more power to do something about it.' John Manly, Mr Duran's attorney, told CBS: '[Mahony] deliberately put Michael Baker back into parishes where he had access to kids. 'That is vile, it is wrong, it is sickening, and he deserves to be in jail.' This morning, Pope Francis met all of his cardinals, including those who were too old to take part in the conclave, at the Vatican. Michael Duran, showing pictures of himself as a boy, was abused by Father Michael Baker when he was 11 . Addressing the cardinals in the Clementine Hall, where his predecessor Benedict XVI said goodbye to them a fortnight ago, Francis said it was 'very moving' to see the crowds in St Peter's Square who gathered for the announcement of the new pontiff. He paid tribute to Benedict by saying that he had 'reinvigorated the church with his goodness, faith, knowledge and humility.' The new pope, the former Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio, will be inaugurated during a mass on Tuesday. Other victims of sexual abuse have called for Pope Francis to defrock US cardinals who covered up for paedophile priests, to formally apologise and to order the release of all confidential Church files from every diocese. Pope Francis stumbled but did not fall as he met the entire college of cardinals at the Vatican's Clementine Hall this morning . It's unclear how much direct experience Francis, an Argentine cardinal, has had dealing with sexually abusive clergy in Latin America, where the scope of the abuse scandal has been more muted. He responded by making it harder for people to become priests and now 60 per cent are eliminated, his authorised biographer Sergio Rubin told the Associated Press. In contrast, Pope Benedict XVI was in charge of the Vatican office that handled clergy abuse cases before becoming pope and was a guiding force behind several sex abuse policies enacted under Pope John Paul II.","Michael Duran was abused by Father Michael Baker when he was 11 .

She said she was âscared what they would do or thinkâ. He was âshocked and couldnât believe itâ when he heard, and he told lawyers that he would have helped her raise the children.

It was only when she was being . questioned that authorities found out there were in fact two babies, . after Lindsey eventually revealed this to the officer in charge of . questioning her. The jury today were shown a tape of the lengthy interview on the third day of the murder trial. Lowe is accused of keeping her . pregnancy a secret, giving birth on the toilet, smothering the twin boys . to death and hiding their bodies in the laundry basket at her parent's . affluent home in September 2011. During the first half of the . interview, Lowe explained briefly what happened to Detective Steve . Malach, telling him she had been having back pain and shooting pains the . day of the births and it was only when she went to the toilet later - . because she thought she was having a 'bowel movement' - that she . realized she was giving birth. Defense: Her attorney John Pellegrin, seen at her side in an earlier hearing, is arguing that she did not know that she was pregnant and was not of sound mind when she smothered the newborns to death . Breakdown: Lindsey Lowe sobbed in court . yesterday as grizzly details of the murder of her newborn twins were . revealed to the jury . She explained that the first baby fell into the toilet and she left him there and did not check on him, yet said she was sure he was dead. She said the same thing happened to the second baby. The detective pressed her on how much the babies were under water and if they had been crying. It was only when he told her that an autopsy would reveal exactly how the babies died did she breakdown and confess to smothering them. Jailed: Lindsey Lowe, now 26, faces to murder charges for her newborn twin sons but prosecutors are not seeking the death penalty . Sobbing uncontrollably, Lowe said she did not want her 'conservative Christian parents' hearing the newborns cry so she put her hand over the first baby's mouth for 'a few minutes' until he stopped crying. She did the same with his twin brother, the court heard. When the officer asked her, 'You knew you killed the babies?' She replied, 'Yes.' Though she told the detective at the very beginning of the interview the father of the twins was her fiance, she later admitted she had had an affair with a man called Jeremy Smith and that he was likely the father. Though she never took a pregnancy test to confirm what she expected, Lowe said she gained weight, her periods had stopped and she began lactating towards the end of the gestation period. When questioned about why she didn't tell anyone or seek any help, she revealed she was too shocked and too scared of what both her fiance might think and her parents. Lowe admits to the detective that she never checked on the babies after she dumped their bodies in the laundry and didn't even look at what their sex was. On Tuesday, two police officers choked up while testifying about how they discovered the twin boys after the father of Lindsey Lowe, 26, from , called 911 after making the grizzly discovery. Officer Jeremy Fentress took the stand on Tuesday and described entering the bedroom of defendant Lindsey Lowe and pulling back a bloody towel. He stopped speaking for a few seconds, then told the court: 'After I pulled the bloody towel back, I saw a deceased infant.' Fentress said he touched the baby with two fingers and found the infant was cold and not breathing. Scene: The newborn was the first of two found on September 14, 2011, at the two-story home in the upper-middle-class neighborhood in Hendersonville, about 20 miles northeast of Nashville . The newborn was the first of two found on September 14, 2011, in the two-story home of the upper-middle-class neighborhood in Hendersonville, about 20 miles northeast of Nashville. The second baby was found by Sgt James Garrett, who described getting ready to lay the first baby down on a bed 'softly and gently' before he discovered the umbilical cord, still attached to something deeper in the basket. Fentress held the body of the first baby while Garrett pulled aside a sheet to uncover the second one â who was also dead. Garrett said he placed the first baby back in the basket beside his brother. Lowe is facing two counts of first-degree murder at her trial, which opened Monday. Both sides in the case agree that Lowe did not act like a pregnant woman in the days and weeks leading up to the birth. Defense attorney John Pellegrin told jurors Lowe was a bridesmaid in a wedding the weekend before the birth where she was dancing, laughing and posing for pictures. Evidence: The video of Lowe's police interview and eventual confession was played to the court today . The night before the births, one of her sorority sisters stayed at her house, even sleeping in Lowe's bed, he said. And yet no one knew she was pregnant. Prosecutors suggested that a lack of preparations showed Lowe never intended for the babies to live. 'Officers, during their search of the house, found no evidence of an expectation of life,' Assistant District Attorney Blanton said during opening statements. 'There were no diapers, no pacis (pacifiers), no blankets, no car seat.' They pointed out that Lowe had been engaged to her college sweetheart in 2011, but had gotten pregnant when she had an affair with another man - who DNA tests later showed was the father of the twins. 'Miss Lowe made no preparation for the births of these children because no one was going to interfere with her life,' Blanton said in opening statements. But defense attorneys argued that the case was not so simple. 'Lindsey Lowe was pregnant, but she refused to accept it, her mind refused to accept it,' Pellegrin said. Court: Jury selection in the murder trial of Lindsey Lowe started Monday. She has pleaded not guilty . Diminished capacity: Defense lawyers' requests to have psychologists testify as to Lowe's mental state when she gave the statement were denied . He argued that Lowe didn't realize what was happening when she started to give birth in the bathroom. 'She thinks her internal organs are coming out,' he told the jury. Family, friends and church members have come to Lowe's defense. In earlier hearings, Lowe's father Mark Lowe described her as a 'model daughter,' saying she moved back in with her family after graduating from Western Kentucky University in 2008 and took care of her mother, who had a brain tumor. If convicted of first-degree murder, Lowe could face life in prison without parole. Prosecutors had said previously they would not seek the death penalty.","Lindsey Lowe, now 26, smothered her newborn twins after giving birth in her parents' bathroom .

In Rome this week, many of the 500 Civil Protection Volunteers used Segways as they patrolled the crowds of hundreds of thousands of people flocked to the Italian capital for the election of the Pope. The original Segway is produced by Segway Inc. in New Hampshire, U.S., and is self balancing. It was first launched more than 10 years ago but many countries differ when it comes to where they are allowed to be driven and by whom. In Israel, users must be aged 16 or over and are not allowed to go over 8mph. In 2009 the Jerusalem Biblical Zoo became the first in the world to offer guided Segway tours around the attraction. In Britain, Phillip Coates, from a Barnsley, made headlines in 2011 when he was fined Â£75 for riding his Segway on footpaths in the South Yorkshire town. He was prosecuted under the Highways Act 1835 because the electric scooter was classed as a motor vehicle. While in opposition, the Conservatives and Lib Dems had lobbied the then Labour government to allow Segways riders to use cycle lanes.

Emergency crews found the dead body of the 16-year-old girl who jumped into a fast and icy river to save her 6-year-old brother. Madison Leigh Wallace jumped into the Big Sioux River in North Dakota's Falls Park after her young brother fell in the river. The body of a 28-year-old male bystander who also fell in while trying to help has yet to be found. Lyle Eagletail, 28, vanished alongside Madison Wallace minutes before her brother 6-year-old Wallace was discovered alive further down stream. Though they the incident started at . around 6pm on Thursday, officials only found Madison's body was found on . Friday afternoon with a search ongoing for Mr Eagletail. Witnesses . say that Mr Eagletail, who was there with his friends and 19-year-old . fiancÃ©, ran to the water to help after hearing the teenage girl's cries. Friends said he didn't know either . the boy or his sister when he reached into the water, grabbing both . their hands after the girl jumped in after her brother. The boy emerged downstream minutes later and was treated by emergency crews. Sioux Falls Fire Chief Jim Sideras said that it still wasn't clear how he got out but that he didn't suffer any injuries. By . Friday afternoon emergency officials were tirelessly working to recover . the bodies with a crane expected to be brought in to help remove some . of the ice. First responders: Lyle Eagletail, 28, has been identified as the man who lunged into the icy Sioux River to help 16-year-old Madison Wallace rescue her 6-year-old brother, right, before both were swept by the current . Tragic hunt: On Thursday evening rescue workers searched through 6-10 feet of foam covering the icy Big Sioux River while searching for the pair who fell in after the boy . Mr Eagletail's fiancee Shawan Rabbitt spoke to the Argus Leader on Thursday while describing herself as 'numbed and shocked.' 'I came over here (under the pedestrian bridge) because we saw a whole bunch of people running over here,' she recalled. A Facebook page attributed to both 'Lyle N Shawna' list them as newly expecting. One witness to the scene, 21-year-old . Napoleon Ducheneaux, said his friend had the boy and woman by their . hands before he just 'slipped and disappeared.' 'I heard him and the woman talking. He . said something like, ""you hold on to me, I'll hold on to you."" And I . kept telling them to come to my voice,' Ducheneaux told KDLT. Chief Sideras . said rescue crews were working against the river's strong current and . large amounts of foam, 6-10 feet deep in places, which firefighters were . trying to blow away with water hoses. Tragic: Her family confirmed her death, saying that she was a 'sweet spirit' In addition to the fact that the water temperature is hovering around freezing which puts emergency crews at risk of hypothermia, police fear other possible dangers lying beneath. 'There can be rebar. There can be a lot of different obstacles under the water that we have to deal with,' he told KDLT. The small boy was seen carried away by a police officer while wrapped in a blanket. 'I was with him and he's with family members and he's doing fine,' ChiefÂ  Sideras said. As for Mr Eagletail, his friend and roommate Hunter Turkey described his effort as valiant. 'He does not seem like the type of person . who would normally do that,' he told the Argus Leader. 'I am impressed . that he did, and I sure hope he makes it.' Heroic effort: Friends of the man who fell in and is still missing say that he didn't know the teen or the child but rushed to help both of them when hearing their cries .

For the first time in months, the temperature rose to . around 50 degrees in Sioux Falls on Thursday. The park was closed Friday as crews continued their recovery effort. Fatal accidents are rare at Falls Park. In 2006, the body of 29-year-old Travis Hallan was found just north of the falls after his canoe tipped over. Progress: Rescue workers taped off the park and worked to eliminate the foam topping the rapids while also slow the water rushing from the top . Condition: Sioux Falls Fire Chief Jim Sideras, whose workers were seen ready and on hand just after 6pm on Thursday, said that the boy is safe, doing fine and with family . In 1999, 26-year-old Slavisa Andric drowned after losing his footing on rocks at Falls Park. In 1997 a bystander pulled the body of 43-year-old Omar Iasi Ibrahim Warsame from the water below a bridge where he had been fishing. Barthel said the city could perhaps prevent accidents by fencing off the entire area, but there's some inherent danger with a fast-moving river meandering through the city.

Lethal: The razor-sharp four-inch blade was found sticking out the loaf of Morrisons bread . Mr Newman said: 'My wife took out the first slice and put her hand in and as the next slice fell we found the blade sticking out.'

A woman who went on a day-and-a-half drug binge while a toddler lay dead in the closet of her house was sentenced Thursday to 22 years in prison. Laurie Cournoyer, 29, and her husband, Taylor, used methamphetamine, sleeping pills, and marijuana during the marathon drug binge when they were supposed to be caring for several children, including the girl who died. They didnât call 911 until 14 hours later, prosecutors alleged. Scroll down for video . Laurie Cournoyer, 29, is escorted out of the court room at the Charles Mix County Courthouse on Thursday after being sentenced to 22 years in prison for drugs and failure to report the death of 2-year-old RieLee Lovell . Moments after her sentencing, the caretaker gave her mother a tearful hug . The Cournoyers, who live about 100 miles outside of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, were looking after RieLee Lovell while her parents were going through a difficult marital patch. RieLee Lovell, 2, was strangled to death by her 11-year-old cousin last summer while Cournoyer and her husband were on a day-and-a-half drug binge . CournoyerÂ  was sentenced Thursday to 10 years in prison for possession of methamphetamine, five years for keeping a place for meth and 10 years, including eight suspended, for having drugs in jail. She was also sentenced to five years for failing to report the death of a child, part of a new South Dakota law that makes it a felony if a caretaker knowingly fails to report the death of a child within six hours. The law was modeled after âCayleeâs Law,â which was passed in Florida after the high-profile death of two-year-old Caylee Anthony, who was only reported missing 31 days after she vanished in Orlando in 2008. During her sentencing Thursday, Cournoyer told the judge: âIt hurts my heart to know that I failed them, not only as a mother, but as a protector.â She added: 'I have had time to see the mistakes I have made, and what it comes down to is the fact that I chose to put that needle in my vein.

Too late: Robin Fitzpatrick had an Epi-Pen to use on her dying son, but emergency responders on the phone told her not to because it was expired . Traces of the nuts later caused him to have a severe reaction. One he, nonetheless, recovered from with prompt treatment. Last Friday, Groezinger-Fitzpatrick had been home just two hours in Plymouth, Massachusetts from Bryant University in Rhode Island. Spring break had just begun and he and a friend were out driving and bought some cookies.

Distracted driving is more widespread in the U.S. than in Europe, according to a study released Thursday that surveyed drivers about their cellphone and texting habits. More U.S. drivers reported talking on their cellphones behind the wheel than their counterparts in seven European countries, the study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found. Nearly 69 percent of U.S. drivers said they had talked on a cellphone while driving within the previous 30 days. The share of European drivers who said they chatted on their phones ranged from 21 percent in the United Kingdom to 59 percent in Portugal. Distracted driving is more widespread in the U.S. than in Europe, according to a study released Thursday . A larger share of U.S. drivers also reported reading or sending text or email messages while driving. Only Portugal's drivers matched those in the U.S. for this distracting habit â 31 percent in both countries. Spain had the smallest share of drivers who said they texted or emailed, at 15 percent. The study was based on online surveys of drivers ages 18 to 64 in the U.S., Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom in 2011. Researchers offered no explanation for why the use of distracting mobile devices is more common in the U.S. than other countries. Mobile device markets in the U.S. and Europe are similarly saturated, making it unlikely that the findings are attributable to differing portions of the population owning devices in the countries, the study said. It's also unlikely that differences in local laws can fully explain why more U.S. drivers than European drivers say they use their phones, the study said. Nearly all European countries banned hand-held cellphone use by drivers, yet there was a large variation in the share of drivers reporting the use of cellphones in the seven EU countries surveyed. 'We can't really say why a greater percentage of drivers in the U.S. appear to be engaging in these behaviors. We really don't know,' the study's author, CDC epidemiologist Rebecca Naumann, said. 'We certainly know it's an area that deserves more research.' In the U.S., 39 states and the District of Columbia have banned texting while driving . In the U.S., 39 states and the District of Columbia have banned texting while driving. Ten states and the District of Columbia have banned hand-held cellphone use for all drivers, but many more states have additional limitations on cellphone use by young or novice drivers. Those laws haven't yet proven effective in decreasing these behaviors, Naumann said. The study's finding that more than two-thirds of U.S. drivers reported cellphone use and a third had reported texting or emailing is consistent with previous studies. A national telephone survey by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety conducted in 2010 found that 69 percent of drivers had used a cellphone while driving and 24 percent had texted while driving during the previous 30 days. Similar estimates have been reported from surveys carried out by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. 'To me this says we still have a huge distracted driving problem. It's a cultural problem, and we haven't convinced the country yet that this is a serious issue,' said Jonathan Adkins, deputy executive director of the Governors Highway Safety Association, which represents state highway safety offices. Researchers also looked specifically at U.S. drivers and found: . -There were no significant differences between men and women in terms of cellphone use or reading or sending text or email messages while driving. -A higher percentage of 25- to 44-year-old men and women reported talking on a cellphone while driving than those ages 55-64. -A higher percentage of 18- to 34-year-old men and women reported reading or sending text or email messages while driving than those ages 45-64.","Seven in 10 U.S. drivers said they had talked on a cellphone while driving within the previous 30 day, compared to 21 percent in the UK .

An armed robber who tried to distract a shop attendant by exposing her cleavage was today sentenced to four years in prison. Tonee Walker, 22, was dubbed the 'Buxom Bandit' after she was caught on CCTV robbing a petrol station in Australia wearing a strikingly low-cut top. She was armed with a knife during the hold-up in Gold Coast in July, and lowered her top to give the station attendant 'something to look at', according to her getaway driver. Jailed: Tonee Walker, 22, has been sentenced to four years in prison after pleading guilty to armed robbery . Mocked: She was dubbed the 'Buxom Bandit' for displaying her cleavage while holding up a petrol station . Walker escaped with $300 (around Â£200) in cash, and gained worldwide notoriety after the CCTV footage was posted online. She was caught after five days in the run because she had forgotten to cover her face and only wore one glove, meaning her fingerprints were found at the scene of the crime. But prosecutor Mark Whitbread urged Southport District Court to take the crime seriously, and said it was only the 'moral background' of the service station attendant, Gary Corcoran, that stopped him retaliating against Walker. âIt was a truly violent robbery, where a man has shown extreme courage acting in the way he did,â the lawyer said. Dangerous curves: And the knife she was carrying looked like it could hurt someone too... Blunders: She failed to hide her face and, while she wore a single glove, she used her ungloved hand to snatch cash from the petrol stations till . Walker toned down her appearance when she appeared in court today â she was dressed in a demure black shirt-dress as she pleaded guilty to armed robbery and stealing a number plate. Her lawyer, Marcin Lazinski, said his client had been high on amphetamines during the robbery.Judge Anthony Rafter said that the footage of the crime was âdisturbingâ, and praised Mr Corcoranâs bravery. Walker was sentenced to four years in jail, but will be eligible for parole in November because she has been behind bars since the robbery. Her getaway driver, Alexander Spinks, told police that Walker had intentionally exaggerated her cleavage before going into the service station with the knife.

It's only 27 days into Lent but today is when many Brits will give in to temptation and indulge themselves in the guilty pleasure they promised to sacrifice for 40 days. A survey carried out by supermarket chain Asda of 2,000 shoppers found that 34 per cent will end their abstinence today. The majority of respondents (41 per cent) cited a bad week at work as the main reason for succumbing to temptation followed by peer pressure from friends and family who aren't giving anything up (35 per cent). Giving in: Those who gave up coffee and social networking for Lent were most likely to cave in first . For a fifth, the thought that they had almost lasted a month was enough to make them feel less guilty about giving up before the end of Lent. Chocolate is a common sacrifice at Lent but many can't go the full 40 days without it . Regardless of religious inclination, three quarters of Brits still use Lent as an opportunity to give up bad habits. The most common things to forgo for the 40-day period were food-related or social networks. Carbs (19 per cent) was the most popular food type to avoid followed by chocolate (16 per cent). More people said they would give up Twitter (17 per cent) than Facebook (12 per cent) while avoiding swearing also made the top five sacrifices. It seems what you decide to give up . determines how long you'll last. Those who gave up coffee and social . networking sites were more likely to fail sooner than those who gave up . carbs and chocolateÂ  - perhaps because the latter were able to see . almost immediate results from their sacrifices. Asda nutritionist . Hayley Marson said: 'Giving up anything entirely for a long period of . time can be tough, so itâs easy to see why people crack before the 40 . days is up. 'Itâs . interesting to see that those who gave up sugary or fatty foods were . most likely to stick to it; probably because of the obvious health . benefits associated with a reduced calorie diet, such as weight loss. 'The thought of devouring a delicious chocolate Easter egg as a reward at the end of it probably helps too!'

Under-30s are to be offered more help to buy their first home, David Cameron suggested today as he sought to revive Britain as a âproperty owning democracyâ. The Prime Minister used a major speech on the economy to warn the average first-time buyer is now 33 years old if they are unable to draw on financial help from their parents. With less than two weeks before the Budget, Mr Cameron vowed he was âdetermined to tackleâ the housing crisis and suggested a fresh package of help could is being drawn up by ministers. David Cameron used a speech in Keighly, West Yorkshire to rule out a shift in economic strategy, but hinted at more help for first-time buyers . Speaking in West Yorkshire, Mr Cameron said there was no âmagic money treeâ that allowed the Government to spend and borrow more. He rejected calls both from Tory MPs for unfunded tax cuts and from Lib Dem minister Vince Cable for more borrowing, warning any move to abandon the austerity programme would mean âinterest rates will rise, homes will be repossessed and businesses will go bustâ. He added: âEven just a one per cent rise in mortgage interest rates would cost the average family Â£1,000 in extra debt service payments.â The Prime Minister warned the dream of . home ownership was no beyond too many people, despite a raft of . government schemes to help people on to the housing ladder. The Prime Minister warned abandoning Plan A Â¿would mean interest rates will rise, homes will be repossessed and businesses will go bust . âWe . donât want to go back to the days of 110 per cent mortgages and . encouraging people to take on borrowing that they canât afford. âBut it is important that people who work hard and do the right thing are able to buy a home,â he said. âIt is a rebuke to those of us who believe in property owning democracy that the average age for someone buying their first home today, without any help from their parents is 33 years old. And we are determined to tackle that.â Since 2005, the average age for all first-time buyers has remained almost unchanged at 29. But for those buying without any financial help, it has risen âsharplyâ from 30 in early 2008 to 33, the Council of Mortgage Lenders found. The government last year launched its Funding for Lending scheme, which aimed to encourage banks to lend more money to both individuals and businesses. Mr Cameron claimed that as a result, the cost of a two-year fixed rate Â£100,000 mortgage with a 10 per cent deposit is now Â£1,000 cheaper than when the scheme was launched. The Premier added: âIt is now possible to buy a new home anywhere in the country with only a 5% deposit, and at very low interest rates.â Mortgage lending will rise this year . by Â£10 billion for the first time since the financial crisis, according . to industry predictions. While the average age of all first-time buyers has remained stable at around 29, for those without financial help it has risen sharply to 33 . âAnd . as we look ahead to the Budget we will consider whether there is more . we can do to build on this success,â Mr Cameron added, in the strongest . hint yet of a new package of help for first-time buyers. He . also hailed the NewBuy scheme which helps people with smaller deposits . to buy a newly built home and the Treasury is offering offered . guarantees for more housing and infrastructure. However, Labour's shadow chancellor . Ed Balls said: 'Families, pensioners and businesses across Britain will . wonder what planet David Cameron is on. 'He . claims the economy is getting better and his plan is working, but . everyone else knows that the economy is flatlining, living standards are . falling and the deficit is rising to pay for the costs of economic . failure.' Speaking at precision grinding engineers Kinetic Landis Ltd, Mr Cameron said there were 'signs that our plan is beginning to work', with jobs being created and the economy rebalancing . Mr Cameron used his pre-Budget speech to warn Britain must stick to its deficit reduction programme or risk being plunged âback into the abyssâ. 'There are some people who think we don't have to take all these tough decisions to deal with our debts,' he said. 'They say that our focus on deficit reduction is damaging growth. And what we need to do is to spend more and borrow more. 'It's as if they think there's some magic money tree. Well, let me tell you a plain truth: there isn't. 'Margaret Thatcher understood that a tax cut paid for by borrowed money is no tax cut at all when she said: ""Iâve not been prepared, ever, to go on with tax reductions if it meant unsound finance"".' Mr Cameron added: 'So yes, we are doing a great deal to help hard working families.Â  But all of these changes have to be paid for â and they have been paid for.' The remarks will be seen as a sharp rebuttal to the calls from both Tories and Lib Dems for a change of direction. Business Secretary Vince Cable used a magazine article to suggest extra borrowing could be used to fund news infrastructure projects . Right wing Conservatives have demanded a raft of tax cuts designed to stimulate the economy, argue the Treasury would recoup the money as firms hired more people. And on the other side of the argument, Business Secretary Vince Cable has broken ranks to suggest capital spending, funded by borrowing, may be needed to kick-start growth. He told the New Statesman that the Governmentâs decision to stick to Labourâs plan to cut capital spending was a mistake which had âeconomic consequencesâ. Mr Cable said there was now a legitimate debate about whether the Government should âborrow more, at very low interest rates, in order to finance more capital spending - building of schools and colleges, small road and rail projects, more prudential borrowing by councils for house building.â He told the magazine that the strategy âdoes not undermine the central objective of reducing the structural deficit, and may assist it by reviving growthâ. Mr Cameron was later asked about Mr Cable's intervention. The Prime Minister said: 'The article he wrote in the New Statesman was cleared and approved by the Treasury. 'He backs the measures we are taking on dealing with the budget deficit and also he is playing a very key role in making sure we deliver this agenda of backing the fastest growing areas of our economy that have real potential for the future. I work very closely with him in doing that.' Earlier, Mr Cable also played down the idea that his comments represented a shift in policy, telling the BBC: 'We just need to pursue what I've often called Plan A-plus. That is financial discipline and getting down the deficit and at the same time pursuing growth. That's what we are doing and will continue to do.'","Prime Minister refuses to abandon economic plan, warning it would lead to rising interest rates .

One of the oldest houses in Britain which was once won by Sir Francis Drake in a bet has gone on sale for Â£1.25 million, with a Lordship thrown in for good measure. The Grade II-listed Manor at Sampford Spiney in Devon is thought to date back to the 800s and was noted in the Domesday Book. It is now a quaint bed and breakfast on the edge of Dartmoor but was once the historic seat of Gerard de Spineto, Lord of Sampford.

Historic: The ancient grade II listed Manor at Sampford Spiney in Devon is thought to date back to the 800s and was noted in the Domesday Book . In 1581, his descendants gambled away the five-bed property and were forced to hand over the deeds to Drake after losing a Â£500 wager. A modern buyer will have to shell out 2,500 times that sum to land the remote property but will at least earn themselves the title 'Lord of the Manor'. Current owners John Pugh, 80, and his wife Rosalind, 70, bought the Manor 25 years ago as a derelict shell but have worked with English Heritage to rebuild and refurbish it. They are not sure if Drake ever lived in the house itself but the legendary adventurer certainly had ties to the village and spent his honeymoon there.

Grand designs: Current owners John Pugh, 80, and his wife Rosalind, 70, bought the manor 25 years ago as a derelict shell but have worked with English Heritage to rebuild and refurbish it . Quaint: Inside the house, there are centuries-old features including large granite fireplaces, arched granite doorways, granite mullion windows and a bread oven . Good gamble: Sir Francis Drake was given the deeds to the property in 1581 when he won a Â£500 wager with the descendents of Gerard de Spineto, the Lord of Sampford . Mrs Pugh said: 'We don't believe Drake ever lived here permanently. He owned a lot of property in the area and his main home was nearby at Buckland Abbey. 'Our research suggests he obtained it for Â£500 and that it was part-payment of a wager.' Drake, who defeated the Spanish Armada in 1588, bought Buckland Abbey in 1580 and obtained the Manor the following year, around the time he became an MP and Mayor of Plymouth. He died in 1596 without leaving an heir and the house passed into the hands of his second in command, Jonas Bodenham, whom he treated as a son. Bodenham eventually sold the Manor back to Sir Francis' brother Thomas. It was rebuilt in 1607, restored again in 1935, and for a while became known as Hall Farm, due to its owner the Rev John Hall Parlby. Following Parlby's departure from the farm it fell into disrepair but in 1987 it was saved by the Pughs. Their property comes with three . reception rooms, two large 17th and 19th century barns and a cluster of . farm buildings set in an acre of woodland and 202 acres of common land.

Inflation:A modern buyer will have to shell out 2,500 times the Â£500 wager which reputedly won Drake the remote property . Mrs Pugh added: 'Nobody can quite say exactly when the house was built. It was first recorded in 1028 but we think it could have been build as far back as the 800s. 'It was certainly well-established by the time of the Doomsday Book in 1086 when people were bringing their tithes here. 'It was rebuilt and extended in the early 17th century after it fell into his disrepair after Drake's death. 'He was a local man, he was born in nearby Tavistock, and after his seafaring he bought Buckland Abbey, at that time the adjoining parish to Sampford. Location, location: The manor in Devon was obtained by Drake, who defeated the Spanish Armada in 1588, in 1581, around the time he became an MP and Mayor of Plymouth . Idyllic: Mrs Pugh said her research suggested Drake stayed at the Manor when he went riding on Dartmoor, but it is not believed he ever lived there permanently . Legacy: Drake died in 1596 without leaving an heir and the house passed into the hands of his second in command, Jonas Bodenham, whom he treated as a son . 'He acquired more and more property as they did in those days. There are various writings people have done over the years about he came to own it. 'Interestingly, there's no paperwork revealing much he paid for it and there are no receipts, which does rather lend credence to the story that it was a wager.' Mrs Pugh said her research suggested Drake stayed at the Manor when he went riding on Dartmoor, where he built Drake's Leat, one of the first municipal watercourses in the country that supplied Plymouth with its drinking water. Mrs Pugh, who has two adult children and a grandson, said: 'Inside the house we have the biggest bread oven you'll ever see, they would have baked bread here for the whole of the village. 'When I arrived there were stories of judges robes being found under the staircase and the kitchen was called the courtroom. It would have been the civic centre of the parish.

London was previously the most desirable place to buy property because it was seen as well insulated from the dangers of the Eurozone, however that belief now appears to have changed with wealthy buyers concerned about the introduction of a UK mansion tax. According to a survey by property agent Knight Frank, While High New Worth Individuals (HNWIs)  HNWIs are increasingly concerned about Britain's political future and have been spooked by the prospect of a tax on homes worth over Â£2million. Tale of two cities: London, with it's famous landmark Big Ben (left) has been overtaken by New York, home of the Empire State Building (right), as the most popular city in the world to live in and own property . Prime location: Prices for sought-after areas in Central London, such as Kensington's Egerton Crescent where the average home costs Â£8m, remain almost double that of comparable areas in New York . Britain's deputy Prime Minister and leader of the Liberal Party Nick Clegg has been pushing for the introduction of the so-called mansion tax to the dismay of his coalition colleagues in the Conservative Party. Stephan Miles-Brown, head of . residential development at Knight Frank told the Financial Times: 'At . the moment what's spooking people is any thought of mansion tax. 'People are are worrying that the Conservatives will have to give way on this as part of a coalition deal. The cities that matter most to High New Worth Individuals . 'The super-rich can deal with facts and figures quite easily. What they hate is uncertainty. They sit on their hands.' Meanwhile New York is seen as safe bet . owing to it's position as the gateway to the U.S. economy and popularity . with South American investors. Bogeyman: Property investors are being put off by the UK's Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg's demands for a mansion tax . Property prices in the Big Apple are also considerably lower than those in London which ranks third when it comes to expensive real estate with prices as high as Â£2,540 per sq ft in prime central areas. New York ranks eighth with prices of Â£1,300 per sq ft. New Yorkâs market performance over the past year has been aided by the growing availability of high-quality new-build properties with prime sales volumes hit their highest level for 25 years. The survey found that Russians, who have long an important driver of the London market, became a growing force in both New York and Miami in 2012 , alongside the ever-rising demand from Latin America. According to the survey London has maintained its position as the most important city in the world in terms of 'knowledge and influence' the second in terms of 'economic power' and the fifth in terms of political power. New York however reigns supreme when it comes to economic clout with a GDP of $1,243bn, more than double London's $536bn.

Work and Pensions Minister Iain Duncan Smith said spending on housing benefit under Labour had doubled in a decade to Â£23billion a year . A crackdown on housing benefit has seen a massive fall in the number of families claiming over Â£30,000 a year, the Government say. There has been a 75 per cent drop in the largest claims in three years, new figures show, after ministers pledged to cut the ballooning welfare budget. Payments to tenants in the private rented sector were capped at Â£250 a week for a one-bedroom flat up to Â£400 for four bedrooms, in April 2011. Work and Pensions Minister Iain Duncan Smith said spending on housing benefit under Labour had doubled in a decade to Â£23billion a year. âHousing benefit over the last decade spiralled out of controlâ, he said. âThis costs every household in the country almost Â£900 a year. âOur reforms are already making a difference and ending the unfairness of these very large housing benefit claims, however, there is more to be done.â There are now just 490 families claiming more than Â£600 a week in housing benefit - over Â£31,000 a year - compared to 1,880 in November 2010. While only 30 households now take more than Â£1,000 a week - or Â£52,000 a year - a drop from 130. But the total number of housing benefit claimants has risen by 190,000 under the Coalition due to the soaring cost of private lets. Rents in England are rising by Â£297 a year, according to analysis of Government figures by the housing charity Shelter. Its chief executive Campbell Robb said rising prices had left many households in a ârent trapâ where they cannot save. A DWP spokeswoman said the overall number of claimants would drop with the introduction of Universal Credit in April, intended to help more people into work. The Government will also remove a . subsidy for spare rooms, which Labour have dubbed a âbedroom taxâ, and . will cap benefits at Â£500 a week with some exemptions for disabled . people and war widows. Research . last autumn by the National Housing Federation found the number of . working families relying on it has almost doubled in three years. The shadows of children playing are cast on the wall of My Street in . Salford. There government claims a 75% drop in the number of families claiming over Â£30,000 a year . The increase was blamed on a housing shortage that has fuelled high rents and property prices. Private rent prices are forecast to soar by a further 35 per cent in six years. There are 5 million housing benefit claimants, up from 4.8million in 2010. Those with incomes of less than Â£16,000 a year can claim housing benefit if they do not have savings of a similar amount. However, under the complex system, people who earn more can also qualify for help depending on the size of their family and any disabilities. The Liberal Democrats blocked Â£6.5billion of cuts to the welfare budget last year including ending housing benefit for the under-25s and limiting child benefit payments to two children. However they are keen to take the axe to benefits for wealthy pensioners. Winter fuel payments could be taxed under plans they have put forward in negotiations over this monthâs Budget.","Work and Pensions Minister Iain Duncan .

Venice has given permission for one of its most famous buildings on the Grand Canal to be converted into a Benetton 'megastore' amid fierce protest from conservationists. The Fondaco dei Tedeschi, a 13th century palazzo, was bought by the international clothing retailer for Â£45million in 2008. Despite promising to spend millions to restore the crumbling facade, the company faced strong opposition from heritage campaigners who claimed it would damage Italy's 'historical identity'. The Fondaco dei Tedeschi was built in the 13th Century to house German merchants . Conservationists say Benetton's plans to convert the building will damage Italy's 'historical identity' Italia Nostra - meaning Our Italy - launched a legal bid challenging the plans and accused Benetton of buying 'full and fast' obedience from the council. Leading the opposition at the council were representative of former comedian Beppe Grillo's 5-Star Movement (M5S) which is in the midst of potentially forming a government in Italy's hung parliament. After more than 18 months of wrangling, the Mayor of Venice Giorgio Orsoni announced on Tuesday the project has finally been given the go-ahead. The Fondaco's beautiful arches were immortalised in this painting by Canaletto . Benetton says the project will restore the building to its original use and create 400 jobs . 'We will see an important part of the city reborn,' he said. Overlooking the famous Rialto Bridge, the building was originally built to house German merchants and combined offices, living quarters and a market. Mayor Orsoni drew criticism for allowing large advertising hoardings to be displayed on the Venice's Grand Canal . Thousands of tourists stop every day to take photos of its magnificent facade, once painted by 18th century landscape artist Canaletto. Benetton have enlisted the services of Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas to turn it into a shopping centre and public area inside the building's 10,000 square metres of floor space. The company says the project will bring the building back to its original use - as well as creating 400 jobs. Crucially, they will also pay Â£5.2million into the city's coffers as a fee for the change of use. Venice faces unique environmental challenges, as it continues to slowly sink into the lagoon. In 2010, the city drew criticism for allowing large floodlit advertising hoards for Coca-Cola, Rolex and Bulgari to adorn palaces up and down the Grand Canal. But Mayor Orsoni says the funds raised are vital for the city's future and that project's such as the Benetton store will boost employment and broaden the appeal for tourists. 'It will bring great advantages to Venice,' he added.","Fondaco dei Tedeschi on Grand Canal bought for Â£45m in 2008 .

"By . Peter Allen . PUBLISHED: . 12:44 EST, 14 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:59 EST, 14 March 2013 . France had no legal right to fine a man for calling its former president Nicolas Sarkozy âa sad p***kâ, the European Court of Human Rights ruled today. In a judgement which could have wide-ranging implications for other countries, including Britain, it was decided that Herve Eon was allowed to use a particularly crude version of the expression âGet Lost!â on a banner waived at the diminutive politician. In 2008, Mr Eon was in Laval, north west France, when he waved an abusive banner bearing the words âCasse-toi povâconâ. Herve Eon said the European Court of Human Rights' decision to overturn the fine was a 'great day' for him . They were the exact words which Mr Sarkozy had himself used towards a man who refused to take his hand at a Paris agricultural show earlier in the year.â Translations for âpovâconâ have varied, but today the European court said that it meant âsad p***k'. When the words were used, Mr Sarkozy was at the height of his unpopularity in France, having recently made former supermodel Carla Bruni his third wife. Many viewed the 5ft 5ins conservative president as a âbling-blingâ chancer who was using high office to attract women, and to enrich himself. But Mr Eon was fined 30 euros, the equivalent of Â£26, for waving his banner in front of a large crowd. Mr Eon was found guilty of insulting the president under France's 1881 Freedom of the Press Act. But the fine was originally suspended in a Laval court ruling in November 2008, as Mr Eonâs lawyers said it infringed freedom of speech laws. Nicolas Sarkozy was at the height of his unpopularity in France at the time having recently married Carla Bruni . The European Court said the penalty imposed had been âdisproportionateâ and violated Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which safeguards freedom of expression. A court press release said such action by the authorities was âlikely to have a chilling effect on satirical contributions to discussion of matters of public interest, such discussion being fundamental to a democratic societyâ. Mr Eon, a Socialist Party activist, today said he was delighted by the ruling, explaining: âItâs a great day for me â itâs the right decision.â Mr Sarkozy, who led the centre-right UMP party, was defeated in the May 2012 presidential election by Socialist rival Francois Hollande after serving a single term of office. There was no immediate comment about todayâs ruling from Mr Sarkozy, who is facing a number of corruption inquiries in France while also trying to build up a career on the international conference circuit.

"By . Associated Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 23:00 EST, 13 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:33 EST, 14 March 2013 . A record number of U.S. counties - more than 1 in 3 - are now dying off, hit by an aging population and weakened local economies that are spurring young adults to seek jobs and build families elsewhere. New 2012 census estimates released Thursday highlight the population shifts as the U.S. encounters its most sluggish growth levels since the Great Depression. The findings also reflect the increasing economic importance of foreign-born residents as the U.S. ponders an overhaul of a major 1965 federal immigration law. Without new immigrants, many metropolitan areas such as New York, Chicago, Detroit, Pittsburgh and St. Louis would have posted flat or negative population growth in the last year. Dying off: A record number of U.S. counties are now dying off, hit by an aging population and weakened local economies . 'Immigrants are innovators, entrepreneurs, they're making things happen. They create jobs,' said Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican, at an immigration conference in his state last week. Saying Michigan should be a top destination for legal immigrants to come and boost Detroit and other struggling areas, Snyder made a special appeal: 'Please come here.' The growing attention on immigrants is coming mostly from areas of the Midwest and Northeast, which are seeing many of their residents leave after years of staying put during the downturn. With a slowly improving U.S. economy, young adults are now back on the move, departing traditional big cities to test the job market mostly in the South and West, which had sustained the biggest hits in the housing bust. Census data show that 1,135 of the nation's 3,143 counties are now experiencing 'natural decrease,' where deaths exceed births. That's up from roughly 880 U.S. counties, or 1 in 4, in 2009. Already apparent in Japan and many European nations, natural decrease is now increasingly evident in large swaths of the U.S., much of it rural. Despite increasing deaths, the U.S. population as a whole continues to grow, boosted by immigration from abroad and relatively higher births among the mostly younger migrants from Mexico, Latin America and Asia. 'These counties are in a pretty steep . downward spiral,' said Kenneth Johnson, a senior demographer and . sociology professor at the University of New Hampshire, who researched . the findings. 'The young people leave and the older adults stay in place . and age. Unless something dramatic changes â for instance, new . development such as a meatpacking plant to attract young Hispanics â . these areas are likely to have more and more natural decrease.' The areas of natural decrease stretch . from industrial areas near Pittsburgh and Cleveland to the vineyards . outside San Francisco to the rural areas of east Texas and the Great . Plains. A common theme is a waning local economy, such as farming, . mining or industrial areas of the Rust Belt. They also include some . retirement communities in Florida, although many are cushioned by a . steady flow of new retirees each year. Moving out: A vacant, boarded up house is seen in Detroit's once thriving Brush Park neighborhood. Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder is trying to attract immigrants to the state to boost population . Since 2010, many of the fastest-growing . U.S. metro areas have also been those that historically received a lot . of federal dollars, including Fort Stewart, Ga., Jacksonville, N.C., . Crestview, Fla., and Charleston-North Charleston, S.C., all home to . military bases . Chattahoochee County, Ga., home to Fort . Benning, was the nation's fastest-growing county, increasing 10.1 . percent in the last year. Per-capita federal spending rose from about $5,300 among . the fastest-growing metros from 2000 to 2010, to about $8,200 among the . fastest-growing metros from 2011 to 2012. In the last year, Maine joined West Virginia as the only two entire states where deaths exceed births, which have dropped precipitously after the recent recession. As a nation, the U.S. population grew by just 0.75 percent last year, stuck at historically low levels not seen since 1937. Johnson said the number of dying counties is rising not only because of fewer births but also increasing mortality as 70 million baby boomers born between 1946 and 1964 move into their older years. 'I expect natural decrease to remain high in the future,' he said. Among the 20 fastest-growing large metropolitan areas last year, 16 grew faster than in 2011 and most of them are located in previously growing parts of the Sun Belt or Mountain West. Among the slowest-growing or declining metropolitan areas, most are now doing worse than in 2011 and they are all located in the Northeast and Midwest. New York ranks at the top in new immigrants among large metro areas, but also ranks at the top for young residents moving away. In contrast, the Texas metropolitan areas of Dallas, Houston and Austin continued to be big draws for young adults, ranking first, second and fourth among large metro areas in domestic migration due to diversified economies that include oil and gas production. Phoenix, Las Vegas and Orlando also saw gains. By region, growth in the Northeast slowed last year to 0.3 percent, the lowest since 2007; in the Midwest, growth dipped to 0.25 percent, the lowest in at least a decade. In the South and West, growth rates ticked up to 1.1 percent and 1.04 percent, respectively. 'The brakes that were put on migration during the Great Recession appear to be easing up,' said William H. Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution who analyzed the migration data. 'Native migrants are becoming more 'footloose' â following the geographic ups and downs of the labor market â than are immigrants, who have tended to locate in established ethnic communities in big cities.' 'Immigration levels are not where they were a decade ago, but their recent uptick demonstrates the important safety valve they can be for areas with stagnating populations,' he said. Mark Mather, an associate vice president at the Population Reference Bureau, noted that political efforts to downsize government and reduce federal spending could also have a significant impact on future population winners and losers. Since 2010, many of the fastest-growing U.S. metro areas have also been those that historically received a lot of federal dollars, including Fort Stewart, Ga., Jacksonville, N.C., Crestview, Fla., and Charleston-North Charleston, S.C., all home to military bases. Per-capita federal spending rose from about $5,300 among the fastest-growing metros from 2000 to 2010, to about $8,200 among the fastest-growing metros from 2011 to 2012. 'Federal funding has helped many cities weather the decline in private sector jobs,' Mather said. Other findings: . -Roughly 46 percent of rural counties just beyond the edge of metropolitan areas experienced natural decrease, compared to 17 percent of urban counties. -As a whole, the population of non-metropolitan areas last year declined by 0.1 percent, compared with growth of 1 percent for large metro areas and 0.7 percent for small metropolitan areas. -In the last year, four metro areas reached population milestones: Los Angeles hit 13 million, Philadelphia reached 6 million, Las Vegas crossed 2 million and Grand Rapids, Mich., passed 1 million. -Chattahoochee County, Ga., home to Fort Benning, was the nation's fastest-growing county, increasing 10.1 percent in the last year. The census estimates are based on local records of births and deaths, Internal Revenue Service records of people moving within the United States and census statistics on immigrants.","Census data show that 1,135 of the .

A 75-year-old Detroit-area woman on trial for killing her grandson . stumbled Thursday when a juror asked a key question: Why confront a . rebellious teenager with a gun? Sandra Layne didn't give a direct answer so the judge put the question to her again. 'That's just what I thought. I don't know why. I just didn't know what to do,' Layne said between loud, heavy sobs. Sobbing: Sandra Layne, pictured, cried as she testified in the Oakland County Circuit Courtroom on Wednesday . There is no dispute that Layne fatally shot Jonathan Hoffman, 17, . last spring at her home in Oakland County's West Bloomfield Township. Charged with first-degree murder, she could spend the rest of her life . in prison if convicted, but she insists it was an act of self-defense . after months of taking care of a troubled teen. Layne finished two days of emotional, tearful testimony. She repeated . her claim that she felt threatened by Hoffman, saying he kicked her and . struck her in the head before she shot him. She said he wanted to get . out of Michigan and demanded her car and $2,000 after flunking a drug . test required under his probation in a marijuana case. But on cross-examination, Layne acknowledged she didn't immediately . tell police about the assault when they arrested her last May. A nurse . said there was no evidence nor mention of it during an exam at a . hospital. 'She said he's a good boy. He would never hurt us. He would never hurt anyone,' nurse Jennifer Colby testified. Jurors who were given an opportunity to ask questions wanted to know . why Layne didn't call 911 after she shot Hoffman and why she rushed to . the basement where there were phones. Tragic: There's no dispute Layne repeatedly shot 17-year-old Jonathan Hoffman last May in their Detroit-area home . The question was asked because . Layne has said she didn't want to kill her grandson. 'When I was in the basement, all I was thinking about was I had to . hide. I was terrified,' she testified. 'Somebody would have done . something else but that's what I did.' Layne emerged from the basement and shot Hoffman again while he was pleading with a 911 operator for help. Hoffman had been living with Layne since 2011 when his parents . divorced and moved to Arizona. She said it was a difficult arrangement, . especially after her grandson was treated in a hospital for using . hallucinogenic drugs. Layne said Hoffman was deeply upset on the day of the shooting after . testing positive for so-called synthetic marijuana. She said she had to . stop the car three times on the way home to calm him down. 'He's got to sit down. We've got to make a plan,' Layne told the . jury. 'He's got to talk to people, his mother, his father. We're . screaming at each other. He said, 'I'm getting out of here. They're . going to put me in jail.' ... He had to stay here. We had to resolve . things here.' Layne said she shot the teen during another argument later at her . home. She acknowledged in her testimony that she told police that she . had ""murdered"" Hoffman. 'I recall saying a few things. I'm screaming, hysterical,' Layne said. The jury will hear closing arguments Monday. Hoffman's father, Michael Hoffman, was in court but declined to comment. Scared: Sandra Layne, pictured leaving the stand for a recess on Wednesday, said she shot her grandson in self-defense because she feared he would harm her . Trial: Judge Denise Langford Morris speaks to defense attorneys and prosecutors during the testimony of Sandra Layne, right, in Pontiac, Mich., Wednesday, March 13 . During her trial last week, prosecutors described how an already wounded Hoffman pleaded with a . 911 dispatcher to send help as Layne shot him again on May 18 last year. Hoffman 'thought he was safe... Sandra Layne walks up and . shoots him again. This time in the stomach,' Paul Walton, Oakland . County's chief assistant prosecutor, said during his opening statement on March 5. On trial: Sandra Layne smiles at her family while entering the court room of Oakland Circuit Court on March 5. She is charged with murdering her grandson, Jonathan Hoffman, 17 (right) In chains: The petite 75-year-old had her handcuffs removed by a sheriff as proceedings got under way last week . Defense attorney Jerome . Sabbota countered that the diminutive Layne feared for her safety during . the fatal confrontation in the West Bloomfield Township . condo that Hoffman shared with his grandparents. An autopsy revealed . Hoffman was shot three times in the chest, once in the abdomen and once . in his left arm. Tests showed the teen had traces of synthetic marijuana . in his body. Officers had been called to the home northwest of . Detroit about two months earlier, when Layne told police she was having a . difficult time because her grandson was very upset and yelling. No . arrests were made that day. Four days before that, the alternative high school senior was . pulled over in nearby Farmington Hills and ticketed for possession of . marijuana and drug paraphernalia. Tears: Defendant Sandra Layne breaks down crying during the playing of the 911 call made by her grandson Jonathan Hoffman at a hearing last July . Distraught: The elderly woman, pictured at an earlier hearing, was said to have been afraid of her grandson . He later received a 93-day suspended . sentence and was placed on 12 months' probation.

She felt she . had no choice. Why else would she shoot him? This is a tragic case.' Hoffman was living with his grandmother while his mother and father were divorcing and living outside Michigan. 'He was a troubled teen, her favorite grandson, and she took him in,' Sabbota said. In . Hoffman's 911 call played during Layne's preliminary examination last . summer, the teen yelled into a cellphone: 'I've just been shot. My . grandma shot me. I'm going to die. Help.' Ordeal: The grandmother is accused of shooting her grandson multiple times at the home they shared last May . A few minutes later, he . tells the operator: 'I got shot, shot again. Please help. Help,' before . his voice trails off and a woman's shouts are heard in the background. An . officer testified at Layne's preliminary examination that when police . arrived, she walked out of her home with her hands up and screamed: 'I . murdered my grandson.' A Glock 9mm semiautomatic handgun was found just inside the front door. Nine spent cartridge cases also were found in the house.

Exiting: Alex Trebek has hosted the popular game show since 1984, but his age and health complaints mean his current contract, up in 2016, is his last . Current host Alex Trebek has hosted âJeopardyâ since it was rebooted in 1984. He also suffered his second heart attack last summer and it has been reported that he wants to retire. Sony has managed to keep Trebek onboard for another three years, however. Meanwhile, their feelers are now out in search of a new host to replace the man whose name is synonymous with âJeopardy.â One of those names is Anderson Cooper. The CNN hostâs contract is up soon and heâs hosted game shows beforeâABCâs âThe Mole.â The more likely candidate, however, appears to be Matt Lauer. Lauerâs . been on âTodayâ since 1994 and host since 1997. Last year, he signed a . multi-year contract that was rumored to pay the host a whopping $25 . million per year. At the . time, NBC News president Steve Capus told the New York Times, 'Matt is . the franchise, and our franchise player has decided to keep leading our . team.' However, since the early 2012 contract signing, things have gotten steadily worse for âTodayâ and the show has lost its 16-year edge on âGood Morning America.â NEW YORK, NY - OCTOBER 15: Anderson Cooper attends the Elton John AIDS Foundation's 11th Annual An Enduring Vision Benefit at Cipriani Wall Street on October 15, 2012 in New York City.

This has insiders speculating that Lauer could take seriously the offer of a new gig as âJeopardyâ host. Lauerâs lucrative âTodayâ contract ends in 2014, which would give him a long vacation before potentially filling Trebekâs shoes when the âJeopardyâ host ends his own run in 2016.","Plummeting 'Today' ratings have insiders doubting if Lauer will be kept on when his $25 million a year contract is up in 2014 .

The countries worst hit by the European financial crisis are also perceived as being among the most corrupt in the European Union, and those perceptions appear to be getting increasingly negative, an international watchdog said in a new report released Wednesday. Transparency International's annual Corruption Perceptions Index shows Spain, Portugal, Italy and Greece with the lowest scores in western Europe. The index measures the perception of corruption in the public sector and not the financial sector, but Transparency's Europe director Anne Koch said the results clearly indicate that people in the countries worst hit by the crisis perceive corruption to be widespread. Student protests in Athens: The Greek people believe that their public sector is the most corrupt in the EU . 'It seems to me to be quite blatantly obvious that the lack of transparency in public finances in these four countries has been reflected in the figures,' she said. On a scale newly introduced for this year's report, where 0 is 'highly corrupt' and 100 is 'very clean,' two-thirds of the 176 countries ranked scored below 50, which Transparency said indicates a widespread need for more openness in public institutions and more accountability for officials. 'Governments need to integrate anti-corruption actions into all public decision-making,' said Transparency International head Huguette Labelle. 'Priorities include better rules on lobbying and political financing, making public spending and contracting more transparent and making public bodies more accountable to people.' Corruption in Europe: Greece and Italy ranked worst of all EU countries for corruption, while Denmark and Finland topped the global list as the least corrupt countries . The survey, which was first conducted in 1995, draws on a variety of sources that capture perceptions of corruption, including World Bank and World Economic Forum assessments, the African Development Bank's governance ratings, and Transparency International's own Bribe Payers Survey. Afghanistan, North Korea and Somalia were ranked the worst overall on this year's list, all tied with a rating of just eight. Denmark, Finland and New Zealand were thought of as least corrupt with scores of 90. Canada scored 84, Germany 79 and Japan and Britain tied at 74. The United States was rated 73, giving it 19th place, and France scored 71. At the bottom of western European nations, Greece scored a 36, Italy 42, Portugal 63 and Spain 65. All four countries are mired in recession, and both Portugal and Greece have received EU bailouts. Riots in Athens: The countries worst hit by the European financial crisis, in particular Greece, are perceived to be the most corrupt in the EU . The Greek numbers, which put it in 94th place on the ranking, stand out in particular, Koch said. If the new 2012 methodology is applied to the 2011 results, Greece fell by 14 places. 'Greece, of course, at place 94 is the lowest state in the European Union,' she said. 'It's ranked lower than countries like Colombia, Benin and Zambia ... which gives you pause for thought.' Transparency's Managing Director Cobus de Swardt said the world's top economies should 'lead by example' and ensure 'their institutions are fully transparent and their leaders are held accountable.' 'This is crucial since their institutions play a significant role in preventing corruption from flourishing globally,' de Swardt said. 1. Denmark - 90 . 1. Finland - 90 . 1. New Zealand - 90 . 4.

It was once a popular teatime treat but now the British flapjack is dying out in favour of cereal bars and U.S-style muffins and cupcakes. New industry figures show UK sales of flapjacks slumped by 23 per cent between 2011 and last year. The fall comes despite the Mary Berry-inspired baking boom that has helped buoy sales of rival products from Victoria sponges to individually wrapped cake slices and bars. And while flapjack sales flop, those of muffins have almost doubled over the same period, said market analysts Mintel. Flapjacks are one of the oldest and most traditional of British favourites, even getting a mention in Shakespeare's play, Pericles, where it is referred to as an after dinner treat. 'Come, thou shalt go home, and we'll have flesh for holidays, fish for fasting-days, and moreo'er puddings and flap-jacks, and thou shalt be welcome,' the Bard wrote. But Britons are losing their taste for it, even though other similar products are selling, quite literally, like hot cakes fuelled partly by the popularity of BBC's Great British Bake-Off. According to Mintel, overall sales of off the shelf (rather than home cooked or sold in a cafe or coffee shop) cakes went up 11 per cent from 219 million kg in 2011 to 244 million kg last year. In terms of value, the rise was just two per cent, to Â£847 million. But this is partly due to a fall in previously record prices for commodities like grain which has reduced retail prices. Mary Berry effect: Cakes sales are booming thanks in part to the Great British Bake Off . The biggest increase was a 99 per . cent volume sales rise for shop bought muffins, up from 20 million kg . sold in 2011 to 39 million last year, said Mintel. Individual . cake slices, such as those sold by brands including Mr Kipling, saw a . 21 per cent volume rise from 29 million kg to 35 million kg in the same . period. There was also a 20 per cent rise for cake bars, like those made by brands including McVitie's, as volume sales increases from 10 million kg to 12 million kg. Sweet temptation: Cupcakes and muffins are profiting from being fashionable tea break snacks . Whole cakes and small, individual cakes such as cupcakes both saw rises, as did old fashioned malt loafs. Mini rolls and tart sales were static. Mintel said flapjacks floundering because they lack big brand support and 'sit awkwardly' between being a wholesome product made from oats yet are also unhealthy because they're high in fat. A spokesman said: 'Devoid of big brand support and encumbered with a recipe that sits awkwardly between wholesomeness and indulgence - and yet is outstanding in neither - flapjacks appear to be floundering in a middle ground. 'After all, you have to go back to the Bard himself for their last notable marketing moment.' Cereal bars have prospered as an energy-rich alternative to flapjacks and some other forms of individually wrapped cakes, said Mintel. And cupcakes and muffins were profiting from being fashionable tea break treats, which flapjacks were not. Mintel added: 'In the 12 months to January 2013, volume sales of flapjacks nosedived. This is particularly dismal considering the total cake category enjoyed an 11 per cent market jump in the same period. 'It's likely that flapjacks have been hit by the rise in prominence of cereal bars. Many of them too have a basic composition of oats or other grains, honey and occasional fruit, similar to flapjacks, yet have clearer associations with healthiness, wholesomeness and on-the-go snacking.'","UK sales of flapjacks slumped by 23 per cent between 2011 and last year .

Carnival announced on Thursday that guests are being flown off the island of St Maarten where the Dream is moored. Passengers will be refunded for three days of the trip and get a 50 per cent discount on future voyages.

Petty Officer Sabrina Laberdesque said the ship has functioning sewage and power systems, adding that officials are working to correct the problems. She said the Coast Guard is not involved because the ship is moored. Carnival shares fell 1.3 per cent on Thursday morning to $35.24 after the cruise cancellation was announced. The Carnival Dream has a technical issue with the shipâs back-up emergency diesel generator which our engineering team is currently working on. Yesterday, during regularly scheduled testing of the shipâs emergency diesel generator, a malfunction occurred. At no time did the ship lose power and the shipâs propulsion systems and primary power source was not impacted. The ship is at dock in St. Maarten. All guests are safe and comfortable. There were periodic interruptions to elevators and restroom services for a few hours last night. However, all hotel systems are functioning normally and have been functional since approximately 12.30am. While personnel continue to work on the technical issue we are making arrangements to fly all guests home via private charter flights and scheduled flights from St. Maarten. Guests on the current voyage will receive a refund equivalent to three days of the voyage and 50 percent off a future cruise. We are also cancelling the ship's next voyage which is scheduled to depart on Saturday, March 16. Guests scheduled to sail on this cruise will receive a full refund and 25 per cent off a future seven-day cruise. Guests who re-book will have their current rate protected on the future sailing.Additionally, any non-refundable transportation related expenses will be reimbursed. Yesterday was a scheduled port of call visit to St. Maarten. Guests were able to spend the full day in port and have the option of continuing to do so until their scheduled return home. All of the ship's activities and facilities are fully operational. We are very sorry for this disruption to our guests' vacation plans and extend our sincere apologies. We look forward to welcoming them back on another Carnival cruise. The Carnival Dream was on the last leg of a seven-day cruise and was docked in St. Maarten when the technical problem arose.

A father-of-17 ignored a fire extinguisher in the kitchen and failed to attempt to tackle the fire with water as a house fire that trapped his six children took hold, a court heard today. Michael Philpott, 56, was accused of planting a wrench outside his house which he used to smash the upstairs bedroom window where the children were sleeping. But he was 'consumed with guilt' when he was unable to reach the children as thick black smoke poured out of the window. The court heard after dialling 999, instead of tackling the fire he handed the phone to his wife, Mairead, 31, and went straight outside in his boxer shorts, tracksuit bottoms and socks to a ladder, 'fortunately' left in the back yard. Accused: On his third day in the dock Philpott was accused by the prosecution of having a 'plan' to be a 'hero' but it turned into a 'nightmare' In the dock: Philpott told the court today 'I did not light the fire. I did not endanger my children' In a series of combative exchanges during a second day of cross-examination, prosecutor Richard Latham QC outlined for the first time how the prosecution allege the defendant planned the blaze and ill-fated rescue attempt. During a second day of cross-examination, Mr Latham told the defendant: 'It was a plan, wasn't it? 'Your plan was to rescue your children and be a hero. 'The ladder was there because that was part of the plan, wasn't it? 'The plan was light the fire, make the 999 call, rescue them out of the back window....You were going to open the window and get the children out and be a hero and a victim at the same time.' During a series of repeated denials about there being a plan, Philpott at one point addressed the 'ladies and gentlemen of the jury' directly, telling them: 'I did not light the fire. I did not endanger my children.' When the prosecutor accused him of pretending to fate as six of his children lay dead, he responded with the question: 'Do you know what it is like to smell your children decomposing?' At which point a court onlooker in his 20s shouted out: 'Shut up, you d**khead - f***ing d**khead', to which Philpott responded 'You shut up'. Trial: Mick Philpott, shown crying at a press conference with wife Mairead, was again giving evidence today . The court was also played part of the 999 call made by Philpott and his wife Mairead, 31 - who is also charged with six counts of manslaughter. The couple told police Mrs Philpott had searched their conservatory for something to give to her husband to smash the window while he was up the ladder. But the court heard there was no evidence on the call of Mrs Philpott either searching for the implement, which has previously been described in court as a metal electrical socket, or passing it to her husband. Asked by Mr Latham why Philpott could be heard to say 'God, please help me', during the call, the defendant claimed he was simply distressed at the thought of losing his children. But the prosecutor suggested it to Philpott it was because he was responsible for the 'nightmare...that was unfolding in front of you'. Accused: Mick Philpott, pictured with Mairead Philpott and another woman . The trial at Nottingham Crown Court has also heard how Philpott, by then aware petrol was the accelerant used to start the blaze, had warned police they may find petrol on his clothing or inside the house when they were seized for examination, because he had carried a petrol-powered strimmer from his back garden through the property a few days before the blaze last May. But Mr Latham told him: 'The one thing you did not appreciate is that not only could scientists detect petrol (on clothing or surfaces), but the type of petrol as well. You didn't know that, did you?' Philpott said he was aware of the fact, through watching television programmes such as NCIS, the American crime show about a naval intelligence unit. The court heard tests on the strimmer . showed Texaco fuel had been used to power it, while Shell petrol was . discovered at the seat of the fire. Total fuel deposits, meanwhile were . found in the U-bend of the kitchen sink. Deadly blaze: Philpott surrounded by the six children whose lives were claimed by the fatal house fire . Tragic: Six children, aged between five and 13, died in the blaze at the house in Allenton, Derby, last May . Philpott could not explain how the fuel had got into the kitchen pipe, but admitted water and washing up liquid was routinely washed down the sink. Mr Latham said that meant the fuel 'can't have been there very long' and suggested Philpott had washed petrol from his hands in the sink that night - a claim denied by Philpott. He told Philpott: 'You used petrol to start this fire didn't you? You put it there. Philpott replied: 'You can try and blame me as much as you like for this fire Mr Latham, but you have got the wrong two people.' Philpott's best friend, fork-lift truck driver Paul Mosley, 46, also denies the manslaughter of their children, Duwayne, 13, Jade, 10, John, nine, Jack, seven, Jesse, six, and five-year-old Jayden. The prosecution have alleged Philpott set the fire to frame his former mistress Lisa Willis after she walked out of the family home in February taking her five children with her, four of which he fathered. The court has heard Philpott was set to face Miss Willis in court on the day of the fatal blaze in May over residency of the five children. Previously in his evidence, Philpott has claimed that he and his wife had received silent calls from a withheld number in the weeks leading up to the fire. But today Mr Latham accused him of 'cooking up' the calls as part of the plan. The prosecutor claimed Philpott was 'upping his plan' in the weeks before the fire and telling parents at the school gates he was confident he would get the children back from Miss Willis. Mr Latham said: 'You told them you had a plan up your sleeve didn't you? She wasn't going to get away with it - that's Lisa isn't it?' Philpott has also told the court that he received death threats from Miss Willis's family in the lead up to the fire. Today Mr Latham claimed Philpott hoped to link the fire to the threats. 'The whole purpose of this fire was to link it to the threat,' he said. Philpott denied the claims and said he would not endanger the lives of his six children. Jade Philpott, 10, John, nine, Jack, eight, Jesse, six, and Jayden, five, all died in the fire at their home. Their brother Duwayne, 13, died two days later at Birmingham Children's Hospital. The trial was adjourned for the day and will resume on Monday. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Mick Philpott accused of manslaughter with wife Mairead and Paul Mosley .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 10:42 EST, 16 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:42 EST, 16 March 2013 . Talented headteachers are risking 'career suicide' by taking on jobs at the most challenging schools, a union leader warned today. Many good leaders have already lost their jobs amid unrealistic pressure to raise standards quickly, while others fear for their futures, according to the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) Brian Lightman. Around 120 people lost their jobs in 12 months, an ASCL survey found last year. 'Career suicide': Brian Lightman said many good leaders had already lost their jobs amid unrealistic pressure to raise standards quickly . But while headteachers who take on the top jobs in under-performing schools have great motivation to turn them around, they often do not get the support they need, Mr Lightman said. In his speech to ASCL's annual conference in London, he warned that headteachers are not 'commodities' that can be thrown away, and suggested there is already a lack of people willing to lead the most challenging schools. Speaking afterwards Mr Lightman said: 'I'm very worried that for many people it's becoming career suicide and that would be distressing for our schools.' He added: 'What I'm seeing is a new, and very disturbing pattern that when a school goes into special measures then very often the solution, apart from turning it into an academy, is to get a new head. 'Very often the head is turning the school around, but it doesn't happen in five minutes,' he said. Heather Scott took on the leadership of Bruntcliffe High School in Leeds 18 weeks ago. At a recent inspection the school was found to have serious weaknesses. She said she believes that she can turn the school around, and has already begun making major changes. 'That self belief that I have, and have to pass on to others is being knocked from outside,' she said. 'I've got, under the new framework, four to six weeks from the first inspection to make changes. 'I'm really good at what I do, but what differences can I make in four to six weeks that I can evidence?' 'Unrealistic': Headteachers who take on jobs in under-performing schools often do not get the support they need, Mr Lightman said . Chris Robinson, became headteacher of the Dearne Advanced Learning Centre in Barnsley nine weeks ago. It is awaiting an Ofsted inspection that is expected to be critical. 'It takes great, great courage to leave a job you've been successful in and take on a school in difficulties,' Ms Robinson said. She said the school has 'tremendous potential' for going forward, and believes it will one day be rated outstanding, but added that at the moment she, and the school are under immense pressure to make rapid improvements. Mr Lightman told delegates: 'Too many ASCL members lost their jobs last year and many more are fearful that the same will happen to them because of the pressure for immediate results. 'They might have been able to get their schools where they needed to be if only they had been given a realistic timetable to do so with the right support. 'Headteachers are not commodities you can throw away and we are not exactly overwhelmed with applicants to lead the most challenging schools.' Mr Lightman called on Ofsted to recognise the situation and to 'put a stop to those teams who go into some of our most challenging schools applying a deficit model of inspection which creates a culture of fear, high blood pressure and lost sleep as people await the dreaded phone call.' He referred to one 'deeply shocking' example, in which an outstanding deputy was appointed head of a challenging secondary school. Ofsted arrived two months into his tenure, and despite recognising that he had made progress the school was put in special measures and is being forced to join an academy chain, Mr Lightman said. 'The net result is that the new, inspired and inspiring head may lose his job, other aspirant deputies who know this person will now only opt for ""good"" schools saying ""if this happens to X, it could happen to anyone"".' Mr Lightman added: 'Undermining and demotivating a whole tranche of aspirant and serving leaders will do nothing to raise standards in our schools and colleges.' His comments come the day after the conference was told that one headteacher believes she is risking 'career suicide' by working in a challenging school. In a question and answer session with Education Secretary Michael Gove, she said: 'I'm so incredibly worried. I need to understand your vision of leadership in these types of schools. It seems to be career suicide for me to stay where I am, making these improvements.' In response, Mr Gove said that the Ofsted chief inspector was making changes, so that inspections look closely at the progress that pupils are making and how schools add value to their education. He also admitted that some inspectors needed to 'raise their game' and said it was absolutely the case that when headteachers are making big changes that they need to have time to do so. Ofsted chief inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw also told the conference that he was trying to raise the standard of inspection teams, and encouraging current headteachers to join to become inspectors. Sir Michael urged heads to sign up as additional inspectors or for a full-time role saying: 'I ask you to think about this opportunity very seriously. Ofsted needs you. I need outstanding practitioners in the secondary sector who can shape and improve the inspection and accountability system in our country.'","Brian Lightman warned of 'unrealistic' pressure to quickly raise standards .

But today, TV magician Dynamo is giving a less starry but no less specialÂ  private performance at a London hotel to seven-year-old JackÂ  Johnstone and his parents. Best known for âwalking on waterâ across the Thames in 2011, Dynamo is here as an ambassador for Rays Of Sunshine, a charity that grants wishes to seriously ill children. He has surprised his young fan Jack â who has cystic fibrosis, an incurable genetic disease that affects theÂ  respiratory and digestive systems â with a visit. Tricking pain: Street magician Dynamo, real name Steven Frayne, began to display the first signs of Chron's disease at the age of 13 . At one point, the 30-year-old entertainer holds a 10p piece â donated by Jackâs father Kevin â in the palm of his upturned hand and hovers his other hand about 12in over it. In a split-second, the coin appears to levitate and then disappears. We stare in disbelief as the magician points to a table a few feet away, where the coin now is. âWooooah!â exclaims Jack. Over the next 30 minutes, Dynamo reads Jackâs mind, turns Lottery tickets into wads of cash and makes playing cards appear out of nowhere. Jack is spellbound by theÂ  performance, and clearly rather starstruck â and I donât blame him. Spooky is the best word to describe the whole experience. Rays Of Sunshine is a cause close to Dynamoâs heart, because he knows what itâs like to be in Jackâs shoes: he has suffered from the incurable digestive condition Crohnâs disease since childhood, which meant long stretches in hospital or at home recovering from bouts of illness or surgery. âBeing really unwell when youâre young can be very isolating, not to mention boring,â says Dynamo,Â  real name Steven Frayne. His own problems began aged 13 when all his friends seemed to experience a growth spurt butÂ  he stayed the same size. Even now he is just 5ft 6in and weighs only 8st. Giving back: Magician Dynamo performs card tricks to entertain fan Jack who has cystic fibrosis . âI remember feeling like aÂ  laboratory experiment because I had to undergo all of these tests and no one could work out what was wrong with me,â he says. âItâs an age when your confidence isÂ  knocked and it was hard being the odd one out. Finally, when I was 15, they discovered I had Crohnâs.â It was learning magic that helped him through those tough times and he says performingÂ  tricks kept the bullies at bay. Crohnâs is a chronic condition which causes the lining of the digestive system to become inflamed and flare-ups are usually in the small or large intestine.Symptoms include diarrhoea, pain, fatigue and weight loss and, in the long term, the inflammation can result in additional complications, such as narrowing of the colon. It isnât fully understood what causes it but genes, a faulty immune system and previous infection may play a role. There is no cure but there are medications to help control symptoms. In up to 75 per cent of cases, surgery will be needed to repair damaged parts of the digestive system. Dynamo underwent surgery to remove half of his stomach, due to a burst abscess, aged 19. The operation was a success but he endured months of painful recovery. He has spent a total of two years in hospital since beingÂ  diagnosed, yet now has the condition under control, without medication, by eliminating foods that aggravate the condition. Crippling: Steven Frayne is in constant pain and as a result of his illness is forced to avoid many foods considered 'healthy' which makes him ill . âI was on 23 tablets a day and although some of the pain went, Iâd have horrible side-effects,â he says. âThey would make me feel sleepy and spaced out which isnât ideal when youâre a magician and you need to be on the ball for tricks to work. âInstead, Iâve cut out all the âhealthyâ foods that actually make me ill â fruits, vegetables, anything fibrous âÂ  because theyâre hard to digest. Now I live off chicken, mashed potato and pasta and have vitamin injections to make up for what my body is missing. Having Crohnâs means I canât absorb Vitamin B12 so itâs important I get that, too.â Although Dynamo is always in pain â likening the sensation to rubbing dirt in an open wound â he is upbeat. âMy stomach constantly throbs but Iâm used to it now,â he says. âWhen youâre busy you learn to ignore it, especially when youâre entertaining people.â And young Jack is certainly being entertained today. Cystic fibrosis affects about 9,000Â  Britons and causes the lungs and digestive system to become clogged up with thick mucous. âHeâs a strong little boy, despite what he has to go through on a daily basis,â says his mother Tina, 38, a healthcare manager from Preston. âHe has to do physiotherapy twice a day to keep his lungs clear and take so many drugs.â Jackâs condition rapidly declined last year, when his parents were told by doctors his lung function had declined to that of a 25-year-old CF suffer. The average life expectancy of a CF sufferer is 30. âJack being able to meet one of his heroes is a big deal for us,â says Kevin, 33, who works for Care UK. âHeâs been through a lot, so to see him so happy is priceless.â To donate money to Rays Of Sunshine, the charity that grants wishes for seriously ill children in the UK aged between three and 18, visit raysofsunshine.org.uk .","Steven Frayne, known as Dynamo, was struck with Chron's disease aged 13 .

Wonder drug: Aspirin can also now reportedly help to protect against skin cancer, as well as cutting the risk of stomach and bowel cancers for regular users . Aspirin could help protect women from skin cancer, a study claims. Researchers found that the longer the painkiller is taken, the lower the risk of developing melanoma. The study of data from almost 60,000 women over 12 years found that regular aspirin users were 21 per cent less likely to develop skin cancer than non-users. But those who had taken it for five or more years were 30 per cent less likely to develop melanoma. Data for men was not part of the study. Every year, around 13,000 people in the UK are diagnosed with malignant melanoma, and 2,200 die from the disease, which is thought to be caused primarily by intense sunbathing or frequent use of sunbeds. Aspirin has been dubbed the wonder drug, with a recent study claiming that it cut the risk of stomach and bowel cancers by around 40 per cent in regular users. However, long-term use has been linked with stomach bleeds and ulcers. The research of women aged between 50 to 79 was published in the Journal of Cancer and formed part of the Womenâs Health Initiative â a major US investigation into links between lifestyle and the disease. Study leader Dr Jean Tang said: âAspirin works by reducing inflammation and this may be why using aspirin may lower your risk of developing melanoma.â She said other painkillers, such as paracetamol, did not lower melanoma. Ministers will this year consider whether some patients should be prescribed the drug as a preventative measure. Aspirin has already been shown to be particularly effective against bowel cancer â one of the most common forms of the disease â particularly if patients have a family history of the illness. Skin cancer: Every year, 13,000 British people are diagnosed with malignant melanoma, often caused by intense sunbathing or use of sunbeds . It is an established treatment for heart disease patients because it helps prevent the formation of blood clots in the artery which can lead to a heart attack. For this reason, it is already taken daily by two million UK angina sufferers. Jessica Harris, of Cancer Research UK, advised caution, however. She said: âAspirin has a range of serious side effects, and at the moment itâs not clear whether the benefits would outweigh the harms, what the right dose might be, or which group of people are most likely to benefit.â Despite drastic efforts to improve diagnosis and treatment, Britainâs cancer survival rates still lag behind other countries. Ministers estimated that 11,400 lives could be saved each year if our cancer survival rates matched those elsewhere in Europe.","Aspirin is found to prevent stomach and bowel cancers and now skin cancer .

A London academy has become the first school in Britain to introduce a 10am start after research showed that teenagers do not fully wake up until mid-morning. Headmistress of the UCL Academy, Geraldine Davies, allows children to arrive at 10am but to leave at 5.30pm. She argues that the school, which has been open since September, is already seeing positive results. Pioneer: The UCL Academy opened six months ago and introduced a 10am start after research showed that teenagers perform better later in the day . She told The Sunday Times: âYoungsters are turning up alert and ready to learn and are focused and engaged in lessons. âWe have no hard data on exam results yet, since we have only been open six months, but the aim is to rigorously review the effects. Pupil and teacher surveys have so far been positive.â There have been calls to expand the project across Britain after research from the schoolâs sponsors, University College London, Oxford and Harvard showed that teenagers are predisposed to go to bed later and waking between 9am and 10am. This pattern, named the adolescent âtime shiftâ, continues until the body clock starts to change at the age of 21. Pupils at the school, which is the first in the UK to be sponsored by a university,Â  have had a positive response, with some adding that they are able to eat a nourishing breakfast and read through lessons before school starts. Biologically predisposed: The study shows that teenagers are more receptive and involved in classes when they have had a later start to the day . Academics in America have shown that forcing teenagers to wake up before the body clock tells them to can stunt their academic growth. A 2011 study involving 19-year-olds from the US air force found that those who started classes at 850am instead of 7am achieved higher results in their exams. Oxford professor, Russell Foster and former head teacher Paul Kelley are set to present a paper on the research later this year. Kelley said that he believed schools across the country should start later as they: âimprove learning, but the sleep deprivation from enforced early starts has an effect on kids' mental health.â","The UCL Academy introduced the later start when it opened in September .

A proposed wind farm on the rugged moors that inspired the Bronte sisters has been banned after the area's literary significance was taken into consideration. Plans to erect turbines on the West Yorkshire countryside that inspired Wuthering Heights have been met with significant criticism from campaigners. Bradford Council has halted plans for a development entailing a 15m turbine at Hardnaze Farm, Oxenhope, near Haworth, where the Bronte sisters grew up. Blocked: Bradford Council has halted plans for the building of a 15 metre tall turbine at Hardnaze Farm, Oxenhope, near Haworth (pictured) where the Bronte sisters grew up . Planners have put the sistersâ literary legacy before the Governmentâs green energy agenda in what is thought to have been the first decision of its kind. The area attracts visitors from around . the world wanting to see the moorland views that inspired much of the . Bronteâs finest writing. More than a dozen applications for . turbines have been submitted to Bradford Council in the past year, on . top of the plans approved by neighbouring Calderdale for Ovenden Moor. But now Bradford Council planners have . ruled that the scheme would do little to boost renewable energy - while . creating a blot on Bronte country. Sally McDonald, chairman of The Bronte . Society Council, said: 'The Bronte Society has objected to a . number of wind farm proposals this year on the grounds of skyline . pollution and the potential for damage these towering structures have on . the tourist economy of the area. 'This decision by Bradford Council in . respect of the single turbine in Oxenhope gives support to the Bronte . Societyâs argument that this is a special and unique landscape and that . this landscape needs to be protected. Literary: The development proposed 15 wind turbines but planners took into account the area's literary significance . She added: 'Visitors journey from around the . world come to see the wild moors of Emily Bronteâs Wuthering Heights and . want to see high waving heather - not high waving turbines. 'I am delighted by this decision and . that all future applications will have to take into account the . importance of the historical and literary associations of the area.' The planning ruling states: 'The . proposed development would introduce an incongruous and widely visible . vertical element into this sensitive upland landscape, whose historical . and literary associations are also central to its wider economic value . in tourism terms. Inspiration: The West Yorkshire moors are thought to have provided the inspiration for Emily Bronte's classic novel Wuthering Heights . 'The proposed turbine would be seen . from a number of vantage points and would result in significant harm to . the character of the landscape that would outweigh its limited . contribution towards overall renewable energy targets.' Officers also felt the turbine could . harm the areaâs wildlife being located just 210 metres from the South . Pennine Moors Special Protection Area. Campaigners are also concerned about plans for four . 328ft high turbines next to a popular tourist trail. The Â£12million scheme, proposed by green energy . firm Banks Renewables, would see two turbines flanking each side of the . Brontk Way on Thornton Moor. Mrs McDonald believes the planning agenda has now changed and developers may have no choice but to back down. She said: 'The decision will surely make a difference to outcome of future applications. But the grounds on which it has been . refused are the same grounds as the Bronte Society put forward in 2012 - . without any success - for much larger schemes. 'In making this decision, Bradford acknowledges for the first time the importance of the unique landscape to the area. 'We are delighted the council is . leading the way such that surely any future applications will also have . to take into account âthe importance of the historical and literary . associations of the area.'

She wears a vibrantly coloured dress and her curled hair is adorned with bows and loops of pearls. But the opulence of this mysterious 17th century woman's costume is only revealed when the tiny portrait is viewed through a magnifying glass. The portrait miniature, known as Unknown Woman In A Masque Costume, forms part of a new exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum examining royal treasures over the centuries. Tiny treasure: This image shows the medallion Unknown Woman In A Masque Costume, which features in the Treasures of the Royal Courts exhibition at the Victoria & Albert, viewed through a magnifying glass . The diminutive portrait, painted in 1609, is the handiwork of Isaac Oliver, and features a lady of the court dressed in theatrical costume ready to take part in a masque - festive courtly entertainment featuring singing, dancing and lavish stage design. Popular in the 16th and early 17th century, the court masque is a historic example of the kind of royal pomp and pageantry that, according to the curator of the new exhibition, is attracting fresh interest at a time when the popularity of the British monarchy is at a high. Tessa Murdoch, curator of Treasures of the Royal Courts: Tudors, Stuarts and the Russian Tsars, the spectacular royal wedding celebrations, coupled with last year's Diamond Jubilee, had whetted the public appetite for the grandeur and opulence associated with royalty. Ms Murdoch is hoping that renewed interest will encourage visitors to the exhibition, which features more than 150 different objects and examines the long-standing links between the British monarchy and the Russian Tsars from 1509 to 1685.

Kennedy, is fighting to get charges against her of driving under the influence dropped by claiming she accidentally took her sleeping medication. Drugged driving: Kerry Kennedy was charged with driving under the influence in July and now says she accidentally took sleeping medication . In New York court filings, Kennedy argued Friday she inadvertently took the drug zolpidem instead of her daily thyroid medication, prior to the July 13 incident. The filing claims the two bottles 'are virtually identical in size, shape and appearance.' Kennedy, who was once married to New York governor Andrew Cuomo, crashed her Lexus into a tractor trailer in North Castle, New York this past summer. Police say the 53-year-old mother of three then fled the scene and was found at an exit ramp. Kennedy failed a sobriety test and was allegedly slurring her words. A small amount of the drug, also known as Ambien, was found in Kennedyâs blood. Letters of support from famous family members and friends, including her mother Ethel Kennedy, were all part of the 99-page motion. âI have too much regard for the lives of others, as well as my own, to place them at risk by driving under the influence of zolpidem,â Kennedy wrote in an affidavit. Also included was a reference to the assassination of Kennedyâs father, Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and uncle John F. Kennedy. Pill mix-up: The daughter of assassinated senator RFK says she meant to take her daily thyroid medication that morning last July . Kennedyâs lawyers noted their client had âexperienced more tragedy by the age of 8â¦than most people experience in a lifetime.â The filing praised Kennedyâs humanitarian work. âBy any objective standard,â wrote . defense attorney Gerald Lefcourt âKerry Kennedy is a uniquely remarkable . and selfless woman committed to women's rights and social justice.â Close call: There were no injuries on I-684 (pictured) after Kennedy reportedly hit a tractor trailer, fled, and was found nearby by cops .

Retired GP Dr Iain Kerr has admitted giving an elderly couple a prescription for sleeping tablets so they could kill themselves . A retired Scottish GP has told how he helped four of his patients to end their lives. Dr Iain Kerr told The Herald newspaper he had given an elderly couple a prescription for sleeping tablets so they could kill themselves together. The 66-year-old is also reported to have told another pensioner how many antidepressants he would need to take to end his life before visiting him while the drugs took effect. Dr Kerr, who used to work at the Williamwood Medical Centre in Clarkston, East Renfrewshire, insisted he believed his actions at the time were in the best interest of the patients. He told the paper: âI think there should be a change in the law because my personal experience is that there are people suffering distressing symptoms at the end of life which cannot all be palliated, and while people should be offered all the available treatments, there may be times when their preferred course of action will be suicide or to be assisted to die.â He added: âI feel the law is out of step with what is socially acceptable to a large number of people.â Dr Kerr told how a couple, who were both in their 80s, approached him in 1990 seeking help to end their lives. Medical problems meant they both struggled to leave their house. The man had problems with his circulation, struggled to walk and had failing eyesight, while his wife was agoraphobic and would not leave the house without her husband. Dr Kerr told The Herald: âThey had medical conditions which they felt impaired their quality of life to such an extent that they felt they did not want to go on.â He stated: âThey asked for something that they could take in an overdose which would lead to their suicide. âI said that I wanted them to tell their daughter what was going on and if she had no strenuous objections, then I would give them the prescription, which in fact I did.â The retired GP said he got the drugs for the couple as he âdid not want their daughter to get into any difficulties or problems with itâ. On another occasion, he said, a pensioner suffering from chronic respiratory problems and poor bladder control had asked about the number of antidepressant tablets he would need to take to kill himself. Dr Kerr, who used to work at the Williamwood Medical Centre in Clarkston, East Renfrewshire, insisted he believed his actions at the time were in the best interest of the patients . After consulting with a colleague, he gave the man the information he had asked for. Dr Kerr told the paper: âHe took the overdose and I went in to see him. âHe was still alive and I phoned his sister to tell her what had happened, and to say I was not planning to send him to hospital, and she was okay with that.â The retired doctor insisted: âOn the occasions on which I took these actions, I was convinced that they were in the best interests of the patient.â Dr Kerr was suspended from practising medicine for six months in 2008 after being found guilty of misconduct following a General Medical Council hearing. That found that he had prescribed a businesswoman, only known as Patient A, with sodium amytal in 1998 âsolely for the purpose of ending her lifeâ.

Gay men in same-sex marriages are living longer - but the same cannot be said for their female counterparts, according to new research. A Danish study has revealed that the death rate for men in same-sex . marriages has dropped markedly since the 1990s, yet women in same-sex . marriages have emerged as the group with the highest mortality. They are more likely to die . at a relatively young age as they are more likely to commit suicide or . succumb to cancer, the researchers said. The death rate for men in same-sex marriages has dropped markedly since the 1990s . Denmark implemented the world's first national law on registered same-sex partnerships in 1989. Mortality was markedly elevated among people in same-sex marriages for the first several years after, but since 1996, with the advent of effective treatment for HIV/AIDS, mortality among men married to men has dropped to a level below that of unmarried or divorced men. In contrast, the study also found that women married to women were at increased risk of mortality, most notably from suicide and cancer. Study leader author Morten Frisch, from Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, said: 'Lesbians may constitute a largely unnoticed high-risk population for suicide and breast cancer, so our findings call for efforts to identify the underlying factors responsible and ensure access to basic health care in this population.' Dr Frisch and statistician Jacob . Simonsen used Denmark's Civil Registration System to follow 6.5 million . adults who lived in Denmark for any period between January 1st, 1982, . and September 30th, 2011. In contrast, the study found that women married to women were at increased risk of death, most notably from breast cancer (pictured) and suicide . The most marked changes in mortality were seen among same-sex married persons. Between 2000 and 2011, same-sex married Danish women emerged as a group with particularly increased mortality. Marriage has long been known to be associated with a reduced risk of an early death and the research confirmed that being married to or living with someone of the opposite sex was the best way to live longer. But they added that there have been big changes in the marital status of Western populations over the past decades. While the proportion of people married to members of the opposite sex has declined, there has been an increase in the proportions of single and divorced people. However, being married itself isn't enough. Married couples who didn't live together didn't get the same benefits - in fact, they were twice as likely to die as those who lived with their spouse, the study reported. Dr Frisch added: 'It is a novel observation that being married was not always protective.' The findings were published in the International Journal of Epidemiology.","Death rate for men in same-sex .

Her mother Wendy said she and husband Darren were woken at about 2.30am by their daughter's cries but thought she had a bad dream.

Debrett's Guide to Entertaining and Etiquette advises that take-out food is acceptable if served on warm plates . It would once have been considered the ultimate faux pas. But standards have changed so much that serving takeaway food at a dinner party is now officially considered acceptable. Phoning for a Chinese meal, curry or pizza is no longer simply the preserve of ordinary families but is catching on amongst the higher-echelons of society too. However, the latest advice from Debrettâs, which has been the social authority on etiquette for almost 250 years, comes with one condition. Anyone too busy to cook or surprised by the arrival of unexpected guests must always serve food on china plates - and that the plates have been warmed up. The new guidance appears in the forthcoming Debrettâs Guide to Entertaining Etiquette and represents a major concession to custom and practice in âpolite society.â Another faux pas that remains out-of-order is any attempt to pass off takeaway food as your own and asking guests to pay anything is also frowned upon by the Debrettâs authors. Johnny Roxburgh, a party planner at society caterers The Admirable Crichton, said serving takeaways to guests allowed hosts to focus on other duties to make the event go well. âItâs about your friends being with you, and if youâre a better, less stressed host, then why not order in? As long as itâs served on good china.â Here's one I made earlier: Johnny Roxburgh, a party planner, says takeaway food should be served on fine china . Polly Betton, a professional party organiser from Tea Time Productions, believes there is never an excuse for ordering takeaway. âPeople donât always expect home-made fresh bread when they come round, but everyone has a car or can reach a shop to get some ingredients,â she said. Jo Bryant, an etiquette adviser at Debrettâs, said: âEven if you are forced to order a takeaway, you can still be a good host by making an occasion of it, allowing your guest to choose the cuisine and by digging out your own chopsticks. âGood entertaining etiquette isnât about adhering to an outmoded code of conduct, itâs about doing your utmost to ensure your guests are well looked after and enjoying themselves.â Debrettâs has also broadened the boundaries of acceptable etiquette by giving the go ahead to eating certain foods, such as pizza, with your fingers, especially in informal situations such as barbeques. Other advice in the book includes, how to cope âwhen all goes wrong,â the correct way to serve tea and how to ensure guests do not overstay their welcome. A recent survey of 3,000 people in the UK found that 12 per cent had ordered a takeaway and passed it off as their own, and one in ten had even roped in their mothers to cook a meal, then taken credit for it.","Debrett's advises takeaway food must be served on china plates heated up .

A Russian artist has taken the unremarkable fruit and used it for a new photography series in which pears are pictured in crazy and often realistic scenes. Stanislav Aristov constructs the backdrops before placing the fruit in romantic, surreal, funny or just bizarre situations. Pear shaped: Stanislav Aristov shot this lonely-looking such dressed in a 'scarf' next to a wintery scene . Ripe: IT specialist Aristov spends hours choosing just the right pear for his compositions . Loved up pear: The fruit are pictured in a wedding scene complete with veil, corsage and wedding bands . Forgotten fruit: This pear is bathed in the light from a window and appears to be in a dark cell . The 30-year-old from Yekaterinburg, Russia, uses his dark sense of humour to bring the mundane fruit to life. He spends hours selecting the right pear for his pieces before building a background and photographing his unusual subjects. Among the series are images of pears dressed as punks or buskers, romantic couples or even young children. In one, a conspicuous-looking pear is seen lurking suspiciously by a comedy wanted poster. Baby pear: The fruit is dressed in a young girl's pink ribbon and pictured with a green balloon . Washed: A pear is pictured in the driving rain trying to shelter under a small umbrella . Clever pear: The fruit wears glasses as it reads through the oversized book . Disguise: A pear loiters suspiciously in sunglasses and a cap next to a wanted poster in a dark alley . Pear-fect: The well-placed pears cast a shadow in the shape of a heart . Aristov uses over-ripened fruit to portray the elderly in the pictures. In one image, a wizened fruit is pictured staring longingly at a more youthful image of itself and in another a wrinkled pear begging on the street goes unnoticed as other pears rush by. The artist also plays on the shape of the fruit. He morphs it into lightbulbs, uses them to cast interesting shadows and in one picture has a cube-shaped pear. Past its ex-pear-y date: A wizened pear gazes at a black and white image of a youthful fruit . Pear-casso: Arty prints of yellow, green and black and white pears feature in this image . Fruity: Two pears are pictured tucked up under the blankets in bed . Strange fruit: A pear towers above a variety of coloured balls pictured in a bowl . Spooky: The artist uses his dark sense of humour to bring the mundane fruit to life . Stanislav, an IT specialist, said his aim was to try and make the curious creations as realistic as possible. Stanislav, who has also gained praise for a separate photography series using burned matches, wanted to make the pears look like as much like people as possible. He said: 'The idea is to present a human-like pear and make it look as genuine as I can. 'The hardest and most time consuming . thing though is finding the model - the correct pear for the shoot. That . can be quite tricky.' Fused: A pear is shown mimicking an electric light bulb and plugged into a wire . Supear heroes: Three pears hold the a gold globe - which has an apple-like stalk - aloft . Appear-ition: Passing fruit appear as a blur as an old-looking pear begs unnoticed at the side of the road . Dedicated: Aristov builds his own background and says he wants to make them as realistic as possible . Square pear: This surreal image features a cubed pair sitting inside a wooden box . He said another time-consuming aspect of the project is to build the sets. But he said the hard work has been worth the effort after the project was praised.

"By . Jaya Narain . PUBLISHED: . 08:36 EST, 14 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:39 EST, 14 March 2013 . Scandal: MP Sir Cyril Smith, who died in 2010, tried to interfere with an investigation into his child abuse in 1970, new documents revealed today . Sir Cyril Smith tried to bully police after they launched an investigation into claims he molested young boys, according to files. The late politician went to a police station in 1970 and demanded to know whyÂ  detectives were investigating the claims. Officers later submitted a file to prosecutors with a covering letter that said: âHe appears guilty of indecent assault.â During their meeting Smith tried to find out from officers who his accusers were and admitted approaching two of the teenagers. An officer then warned him about interfering with witnesses and accused the politician of âfishingâ for information, according to the records. Last night an MP claimed the documents â released in a Freedom of Information request this week â prove that 30st Smith was trying to meddle with the police investigation. Six weeks after his visit to Rochdale police station detectives passed the file to prosecutors, describing his conduct as âinexcusableâ. Their covering note added: âHe has used his unique position to indulge in a sordid series of indecent episodes with young boys to whom he had a special responsibility. He appears guilty of numerous offences of indecent assault.â Attempt: Smith was trying to find out the names of his accusers as he said it would impact on his electioneering in Rochdale . The file, submitted by Lancashire Constabulary, was examined by prosecutors who decided to take no further action against him. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has now admitted it should have prosecuted the politician after . allegations of abuse in the 1960s. The decision not to prosecute left Smith free to prey on other vulnerable young children, it later emerged. Meddling: ' The former Liberal MP for Rochdale has been accused by the current one Simon Danczuk, who says it shows how hard Smith tried to influence the police . In 1972 â two years after the case . was dropped â he won the Rochdale by-election for the Liberals and . served as MP until 1992. He died aged 82 in 2010. This week it emerged that Jimmy . Savile could also have been stopped from abusing children up to 50 years . ago, but police failed to act on allegations. Documents show that in January 1970 . Smith, then a prominent Liberal councillor, asked to meet detectives at . Rochdale police station to find out the names of his accusers. A transcript of the conversation . between Smith and detectives shows he was determined to challenge the . police for launching an investigation. Smith began the meeting by asking . bluntly: âWhy are the inquiries going on?â and âWhom did you approach . for statements?â He also asked what stage the police had reached in . their inquiry and when he would know if he was to be charged. Simon Danczuk, Labour MP for . Rochdale, said the documents prove Smith tried to bring pressure to bear . on the police to drop charges. Smith was accused of inflicting . humiliating punishments on teenage boys in the 1960s and 70s at a hostel . he had helped to set up. His victims say he would spank their naked . bottoms and order them to strip for âdegradingâ medicals despite a . doctor not being present. It emerged that between 1970 and 1998 . police tried to have him charged three times but when his 80-page file . was first passed to the Director of Public Prosecutions it was marked . âno further actionâ. Last year the CPS admitted Smith avoided prosecution only because sex abuse cases were dealt with differently 40 years ago. For decades, damaging rumours swirled around Rochdale MP Sir Cyril Smith - a political legend locally and nationally. But . despite police 40 years ago being convinced he had indecently assaulted . young boys, the 30-stone Liberal never faced justice. Today a transcript of a conversation her had with police shows how he tried to 'interfere' with their investigation. Saturday January 24, 1970 - 11.20am, Rochdale police station . OFFICER: . Well, very briefly the allegations concerning that, are that you went . along there and examined these boys by taking their pants down. Whether . that's right or not, I don't know. CYRIL: I understand that that's the subject of the investigation. OFFICER: Which, pending on what explanation you put forward, would seem improper. OFFICER: If my information is right, you spoke to one of the boys, who has been interviewed. CYRIL: Yes. OFFICER: What was that about? CYRIL: . He told me what you had been asking him. He told me he had made a . statement to you. I've seen two of them and the third came to see me. I've asked them if they have made statements. OFFICER: I must . warn you about interfering with witnesses. The only reason I am here . this morning is because you wanted to see me. I did not want to see you. You must have some suspicion about you and them, about what's in the . statements or you would not be here, would you? CYRIL: Well - . er - I'm hesitating, not because I'm frightened, but I've seen a . solicitor obviously, and he says I must make no statement or answer no . questions. If they want to question you on those lines, tell them that . you have appointed a solicitor. It's not that I'm afraid to answer the . questions, it's purely because I'm advised not to do. OFFICER: What you have come on this morning is just a fishing expedition. You want to see what we know. CYRIL: . Well, yes, fishing - I think that is fair comment. But one of my . problems is - I don't know if you know about local affairs. OFFICER: No, I have no connection locally. CYRIL: . Well the situation is this. In three weeks time, I've got to give a . decision, one way or another, whether I'm going to fight the next . Parliamentary Election as a Liberal in Rochdale, and if I'm going to be . charged, I'm not going to accept. Guilty or not guilty, it would be . unfair to the party. On the other hand, if I am not going to be charged I . would like to have a do, and I have got to make my mind up in the next . three weeks.","Secret documents reveal he demanded police hand over names of accusers .

Hundreds of Christians protesting after a Muslim mob burned their homes have clashed with police today. Dozens of homes were set alight in eastern Pakistan after a non-Muslim was accused of making offensive comments about Islam's Prophet Mohammed, police said. Officers have arrested 150 people accused of starting the fires. Pakistani demonstrators shout slogans during a protest after a Christian was accused of blasphemy . An angry mob burned dozens of Christian's homes and belongings after the accusation was made . Many Christians lost their homes, belongings and life savings during the protests on Friday . It came as Christian demonstrators blocked a main highway in Lahore and police fired tear gas shells to disperse the protesters, who demanded assistance from the government. Christians across the country rallied . against the incident, but the main demonstrations were in Lahore, the . southern port city of Karachi, the capital, Islamabad, and the adjoining . city of Rawalpindi. Government spokesman Pervaiz Rasheed promised it would help hem rebuild their houses, but the Christians expressed dissatisfaction with the way the government was handling the incident. 'I have been robbed of all of my life's savings,' Yousuf Masih said, standing close to his burned house. He said the government's announcement that it would give 200,000 rupees (Â£1,300) compensation to each family was a joke. Pakistani Christians clashed with police on Sunday as they demonstrated against the mob attack, right, and the amount of compensation and help offered by the government and clergymen visit the burnt homes, left .

Police fired tear gas shells to disperse the Christian protestors as they rallied throughout the country . Protesters damaged several vehicles, uprooted a fence along the road and burned an electricity generator. Seven policemen were injured when the protesters pelted them with stones. The incident began on Friday after a Muslim accused a Christian man of blasphemy - an offence that in Pakistan is punished by life in prison or death. Yesterday, a mob of angry Muslims rampaged through the Christian neighbourhood, burning about 170 houses. The Christian man is in police custody pending an investigation into the allegations. Those who rioted are being investigated for alleged arson, robbery, theft, and terrorism, said police officer Abdur Rehman. In Karachi, more than 1,000 protesters . blocked a road in a main market and damaged about 25 vehicles, said . police officer Ali Raza. Akram Gill, a bishop in the Lahore . Christian community, said the incident had more to do with personal . enmity between two men - one Christian and one Muslim - than blasphemy.

Families survey the burnt wreckage of their homes and belongings, including a blackened motorcycle . He said the men got into a brawl after drinking late one night, and in the morning the Muslim man made up the blasphemy story as payback. Such accusations of blasphemy in Pakistan can prompt huge crowds to take the law into their own hands. Once an accusation is made it is difficult to reverse, partly because law enforcement officials and politicians do not want to be seen as being soft on blasphemers. According to Human Rights Watch, there are at least 16 people on death row for blasphemy and another 20 are serving life sentences. Last year, there was a rare reversal of a blasphemy case. A teenage Christian girl with suspected mental disabilities was accused of burning pages of the Koran. But she was later released after a huge domestic and international outcry about her treatment. A local cleric where she lived was arrested and accused of planting the pages in her bag to incriminate her, a rare example of the accuser facing legal consequences. However, he was later freed on bail.","Dozens of homes were burned after a Christian was accused of blasphemy .

The judge said drug-addict Edward Hanratty had 'failed lamentably' as a father after pleading guilty to child neglect. Hanratty also jailed for three years on separate charges of conning a 91-year-old man . A neglectful father who put his 'self-indulgent drugs lifestyle' ahead of his baby son, who died when a television fell on his head, has been jailed today. Judge Anthony Russell, QC, the Recorder of Preston, told drug addict Edward Hanratty he had 'failed lamentably' as a father. Hanratty, 41, was passed out on the kitchen floor when the baby's mother Natalie McMilian, 25, knocked over the five-stone television after she had drunk alcohol and taken drugs. Four-month-old Kian McMillan died from catastrophic head injuries. He had been laying on a changing mat at the family home in Burnley, Lancashire, when McMillan knocked over the television set as she tried to plug in a scart lead to watch a DVD. Sentencing Hanratty to 10 months in prison for child neglect, Judge Russell said: 'It was abundantly clear that you and your partner were in no fit state to look after your child that night. 'Over the short life of your child you gave priority to yourself and your self-indulgent drugs lifestyle and neglected the life of Kian. 'You must bear some responsibility for the death because you were the father of Kian. 'You failed lamentably. You should have protected Kian from his mother's neglect.' Hanratty was also sentenced to three years in prison today for conning a 91-year-old man from Bradford out of his life savings. In January, his former partner McMillan, from Leeds, was imprisoned for 15 months after she admitted neglect over the death of Kian in December 2011. She was cleared of manslaughter by a jury. Hanratty, from Bradford, also pleaded guilty to child neglect during the trial after giving his evidence which Judge Russell described as 'a very poor display in the witness box'. He failed to turn up for the sentencing in January at Preston Crown Court because he said he had no money for his train fare from Bradford. Hanratty was sentenced today for draining nearly Â£30,000 from his victim to feed his drug addiction, the court heard. He had befriended the pensioner 15 years earlier when he randomly knocked on his door and askedÂ  for financial help. They became friends but as the years went by Hanratty became more persistent in asking for money. In 2007 he was jailed for 30 months for dishonesty offences in which he duped another elderly victim out of money. Mother Natalie McMillan was jailed in January after pleading guilty to child neglect. Her son Kian, right, died of catastrophic head injuries when she knocked over the five-stone TV . He used that conviction to trick the . 91-year-old out of more money as he lied that he needed to pay hefty . compensation sums and court costs to save him from more time in jail. Hanratty even drew up a fake solicitor's letter demanding money when his elderly victim became suspicious. He was finally caught when a family . friend of the victim recorded phone calls made by the defendant in which . he asked for money, and passed them on to the police. Last November Hanratty pleaded guilty at Leeds Crown Court to two counts of fraud. Judge Russell told him: 'The fraud is a particularly mean offence involving the targeting of a vulnerable elderly man who you had known for some years and had taken pity on you and given you money over a long period of time. 'Preying on the elderly in this way is utterly reprehensible.' Hanratty received a two-month concurrent sentence for stealing a boy's pedal cycle outside a house in the Bradford area last September. James Bourne-Arton, defending, said the offence of child neglect was directly as a result of his 'long-standing drug addiction which is clearly the root of all of his offending'. His addiction had led him into a 'hopeless situation' over the last 10 years, he added. Recently Hanratty had been the victim of 'a serious assault' at his home following the publicity of the case involving his son's death, said Mr Bourne-Arton. He suffered a number of broken bones, had boiling water poured on his body and had clumps of his hair removed. His barrister said his client was planning to take advantage of drug rehabilitation programmes while in custody to address his problems. Judge Russell told him: 'Unless you do so there is really little hope for your future.'","Kian McMillan died of catastrophic head injuries when five-stone TV fell .

A shameless yob who starred in a BBC Panorama documentary about Britain's toughest council estate has been given his second ASBO after waging a new campaign of terror against locals. Jess Volkert, 21, angered millions of viewers by swaggering around the streets in a grey tracksuit during the programme and bragging about his life of crime and coming from the 'gutter.' Police hauled him back before the courts - just a month after being released from a young offenders institute - after locals on the Shadsworth estate in Blackburn, Lancashire, filed a string of complaints. Scroll down for video . Yob: Jess Volkert gained notoriety when he featured on the BBC Panorama programme about Britain's toughest council estates and was filmed bragging about breaking the terms of his ASBO . Shameless: Volkert, 21, has now been banned from going on the Shadsworth estate in Blackburn under the terms of the latest ASBO . They claimed he had subjected them to a campaign of intimidation, harassment and vandalism. He has now been barred from going into Shadsworth estate or the nearby the . Delph Estate and parts of the Queens Park area in Blackburn. He also faces up to five . years jail if he is caught being drunk in a public place and acting or . inciting others to act anti-socially in the Blackburn and Darwen areas. Volkert achieved nationwide infamy last summer when he was featured . as one of the main hoodlums terrorising locals in Panorama's . controversial edition called Trouble On The Estate. He was filmed repeatedly defying the terms . of his first ASBO and terrorising local shopkeeper Tarsem Singh. As a friend smoked cannabis in front of the . cameras, Volkert boasted of the ASBO and told programme makers: 'They . want us to sort ourselves out but we're from the gutter so f*** 'em. I'll be back inside by the end of the week.' At the time the programme was filmed Mr Singh said he had barred . Volkert at least ten times but he kept returning to the shop, stealing chocolate bars and saying there was . nothing he could do about it. Local police said Volkert had been a 'persistent nuisance' and applied for the second ASBO after trying to reason with him. Volkert was released only last month after he was locked up for breaching the terms of his first anti-social behaviour order. Two years ago he was brought before the courts after waging a racist two-year 'reign of terror' against Mr Singh, who runs a grocery store on the estate. Last month he posted pictures on his Facebook page apearing to show his former cell at a young offender institute brimming with household goodies and accompanied by the message: 'This is ma new cell, smashed it in 5 month hahahaa!!!!!!!' Jobless Volkert became notorious on his . estate in 2010 after he led a gang of yobs which targeted Mr Singh's shop, Rothesay Road, Shadsworth, and hurled racist abuse at him. In . 2011 Volkert pleaded guilty to racially aggravated harassment and was . jailed for 12 weeks and ordered to abide by the terms of the ASBO. Mr Singh said he did not want to leave his shop because he was frightened of being assaulted. Gutter: Volkert gained local infamy by appearing in the documentary called Trouble On The Estate . Terrorised: Tarsem Singh, who runs the spar on the Shadsworth estate, said he was too scared to leave his shop at one stage for fear of being assaulted by Volkert . 'I feel . vulnerable and intimidated in my own place of work,' said Mr Singh. 'He . finds it amusing to give me racist abuse and intimidate my customers. 'I . feel that if he is not stopped from terrorising me I will be forced to . leave my shop by his malicious behaviour. Since I took over the Spar he . has constantly molested me and my staff, showing disregard for customers . and staff alike.' PC Mike Kearns community beat manager for the area said: 'Volkert has caused many problems for residents and has made life very difficult for local people. 'This ASBO should send a positive message to the public that the police and courts will not accept this sort of behaviour. 'People should be able to go to their local park or shop without being subject to this kind of disgraceful and unacceptable behaviour. Barred: Volkert has now been banned from the Shadsworth Estate in Blackburn, pictured . Locked up: Volkert posted pictures on Facebook of what appears to be his room at the young offenders institution. He was released in January after breaching the terms of his first ASBO . 'We've tried to work with him but his behaviour has continued to cause problems for people and I hope this order will go some way in reassuring the community that action has been taken. Any breaches of the ASBO will be dealt with robustly.' Volkert's latest ASBO comes shortly after he was released from another jail term in January for breaching the first order. He also had previous convictions for assaulting his own father, smashing up a house and beating up his girlfriend's ex-partner. A Lancashire Police spokesman said: 'Volkert had been responsible for repeated problems in the Shadsworth area. 'Police received regular complaints from local residents about his behaviour including intimidation, harassment, threats of violence and damage to property. 'ASBO's are just one tactic we use to tackle the concerns of anti-social behaviour highlighted by members of the community.'","Jess Volkert, 21, featured on the BBC Panorama programme last summer .

A six-month-old baby girl died this morning after she was shot five times in Chicago during an attack on her father - just months after her mother was shot and wounded while she was still in the womb. The murder of little Jonylah Watkins - who was the victim of gun violence twice before she was even a year old - has horrified even a city where shootings have become commonplace. The news sent shock waves throughout the country. Jonylah was hit in her lungs, her liver, her leg, her shoulder and her bowel when a gunman opened fire in broad . daylight on Monday in the Woodlawn neighborhood of Chicago as her father Jonathan Watkins changed her diaper. Mr Watkins, 29, an alleged gang member, was the target of the attack. He was shot twice, but survived and is in critical condition at the hospital. Murdered: Jonylah Watkins was shot five times as her father Jonathan changed her diaper. She survived a separate shooting of her mother Judy when she was still in the womb . Tragedy: Jonylah 's murder has shocked Chicago - a city where gun violence in some neighborhoods has become routine . Violence: Mr Watkins was changing his daughter's diaper in the passenger seat of his van when a gunman walked up behind him in broad daylight and opened fire . 'This morning, the baby passed away,' the Reverend Corey Brooks, a family spokesman, told the Chicago Tribune. 'We have another tragedy in the city of Chicago.' Jonylah underwent several hours of surgery at Comer Children's Hospital at the University of Chicago as doctors frantically tried to save her life. Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy said the shooting appears to be gang-related, though detectives don't have a specific motive. Despite the shocking crime, neighbors are refusing to cooperate with police. 'We don't have one individual who's stepping up to help us,' McCarthy said. Horrified: Jonylah's mother Judy Watkins, 20, was at work at McDonald's when she shooting happened. She was shot and wounded when her daughter was still in the womb . Heartbroken: Contoria Power, Jonylah's cousin, sobs as she talks to family on her cell phone outside the scene of the shooting . Chicago continues to struggle with devastating gun violence at some of the highest rates in the nation. The city had 57 murders in January and February - including 43 in January alone, the most violent month in a decade. The number grabbed national headlines at a time when Congress was debating tougher gun control laws. Many - if not most - of the killings are the result of gang-related violence that is largely concentrated on the city's south side. The 43 murders in January in Chicago compare to just 24 in New York for the same month - despite the Big Apple being three times the size of the Windy City. The killing of Jonylah Watkins is only the latest high-profile Chicago murder to shock the nation. Just days after she performed at President Barack Obama's inauguration ceremony in Washington, Hadiya Pendleton, 15, was killed on the street near her home. Still, there is good news. In February the city charged just 14 murders - the lowest number since 1957. Mr Watkins told theÂ Chicago Sun-Times from his hospital room that he was devastated by the death of his infant daughter. 'I was trying to help. I was trying to help. I was trying to help her,' he said, breaking down. Still, he claims he has no idea who shot him or why he was targeted. The shooting on Monday comes months after her mother Judy, 20, was hit by a gunman when she was pregnant with Jonylah. Her family said Mrs Watkins was hit in the knee when she was eight months pregnant as she walked home with a group of women. She was at work at McDonald's when her daughter was fatally wounded on Monday. In January and February this year, 57 people were killed in Chicago - most of them victims of gang-related shootings on the south side of the city. Chicago gained national attention when its murders for January spiked to 43, the highest rate in years - making the city even more dangerous than when mobster Al Capone ruled the streets. In February killings dropped to 14 for the month - the lowest since 1957. Reverend Brooks, the Watkins family spokesman, stood with Mrs Watkins outside the hospital after the baby's surgery. He told DNAinfo: âThis mother is really hurt. We need everyone in Chicago praying for this family right now. Jonylah's family said she was hit in the lung, liver, shoulder, bowel and leg . 'For a baby to get shot is despicable. Whenever anyone shoots a baby, that's a cowardly act.' Police said Mr Watkins, 28 has links to the Gangster Disciples clique. Mr Watkinsâ family denies he has ties to gangs. The gunman shot at the father and baby from an alley and hit Mr Watkins in the cheek and buttocks, Chicago police spokesman John Mirabelli said. The gunman then got into a nearby blue minivan and fled the scene, according to DNAinfo. Dominique Young, 21, Mr Watkins' sister, said she heard the gunfire and arrived at the van within seconds to find the windows had been shot through. She told DNAinfo: âThey knew she was in there and they tried to take my niece's life, and it's so wrong.' Rev Brooks' church New Beginnings Church of Chicago is offering a $5,000 reward for information that leads to an arrest. The family have called on the 'cowardly' gunman to turn himself in.","Jonylah Watkins, age six months, was shot in her liver, her lungs, her bowel and her leg .

Abbie Emmett, 27, died just days after she had arrived in the United Arab Emirates with new husband Sean, 43, following their wedding in South Africa. Mr Emmett is now facing jail after he was accused of smelling of alcohol when he went to sign police papers to organise the release of her body. Sean Emmett was arrested when police said he smelt of alcohol as he went to a station to organise the release of his wife Abbie's body. She died last month after falling from a hotel window during their honeymoon . He said he had drunk three beers, three sambucas and two brandies the previous night but denied being drunk in public, according to The Sun. The authorities in Dubai are now pressing charges despite the alcohol being legally bought at the Jumeirah Creekside Hotel. Father-of-three Mr Emmett told The Sun yesterday: 'There is no way on Earth I would walk into a police station drunk. 'Unfortunately if you have any alcohol in your system it seems to be very black and white here - they just think you're drunk.' Mr Emmett said he has already spent four days in a prison cell after his arrest on February 28 and is now banned from leaving Dubai until he is brought before a judge on April 30. He has signed a statement admitting that he drank alcohol without a licence, The Sun reported. Drinking alcohol in Dubai is illegal without a specific licence. The Foreign Office said it is providing consular assistance. Professional racer Mr Emmett, pictured at a British Superbikes race in 2004, denied being drunk but said he has been told he cannot leave Dubai until he is brought before a judge . The couple had been staying at the luxury Jumeirah Creekside Hotel in Dubai, when Mrs Bennett died . Mrs Emmett, a vicar's daughter, fell from the hotel balcony on February 19. Reports at the time quoted local police as saying that forensic tests had revealed she had been drinking but they said there were no suspicious circumstances and the case was recorded as a suicide. The couple shared a flat in Addlestone, Surrey, where Mr Emmett runs a bike taxi service. Reverend Christopher Elson, the father of Mrs Emmett, said previously that his family were 'shocked and devastated' about her death. He told 7Days: 'Abbie was loved for her talent and humour by us all.' Mr Emmett made 50 MotoGP appearances and competed in Grand Prix races for Suzuki between 1993 and 1996. A Foreign Office spokeswoman told MailOnline: 'We are aware of the arrest of a British national, Sean Emmett, in Dubai on 28 February.'We are providing consular assistance.'","Sean Emmett was arrested at a police station and spent four days in a cell .

Karen Shotbolt, right, denied she was offended by Sir Alex Ferguson's comments on International Women's Day that she had been 'dragged out of the kitchen' Ferguson then responded: 'She has dragged herself out of the kitchen.

She told The Sun: 'I was joking with the journalists and most of them laughed.'

The rejection letter from 1994 was leaked to The Mail on Sunday. It read: 'Most of the players felt . that football was very much a male sport and did not really like the . thought of females being involved with the treatment of sports injuries . within the training complex.' The letter, signed by the 71-year-old, was written in response to a 20-year-old physioâs request for a work placement and left her âhurt and insultedâ.

Although Agafya Lykova wants to stay in the wooden shack she was born in, the hermit has asked for a small gift from officials during her latest contact with the outside world - a new goat and some boots. Agafya, 68, is the last surviving member of the Old Believer Lykov family who fled from Stalin's religious persecution into the Siberian taiga in 1936. Alone: Agafya Lykova, pictured in the 1980s with father Karl, left, at their home, and a professor, right, asked for a goat and some boots during her latest visit from rangers . Rehomed: Agafya gave two kittens in exchange for supplies. Bagira, pictured, has been given to new family . They did not see another human being until 1978 when a team of geologists stumbled across their self-built home. Her family, father Karp Iosifovich, mother Akulina, brothers Savvin and Dmitry and sister Natalya have all since died but Agafya refuses to move. Rangers visited her last month and she asked for a new cockerel, a goat and some boots. She also asked that they take two kittens - a male and female - back with them. The animals are descendants of cats taken by the family when they fled into the forest. Agafya, who was born in the forest, asked for the gifts in exchange for the cats and instead of a medal 'For Belief and Kindness' that Aman Tuleyev, Governor of the Kemerovo region wanted to give her. She was quoted in theÂ Siberian Times . as saying: 'My old cock stopped crowing, please can I have a new one? Also my old goat died and I need another one. Old Believers: Agafya and her father Karp pictured after they were found by geologists in 1978 . Survivor: Agafya, pictured with her sister Natalia, is the only member of her family still alive .

Do say hello to governor Aman Tuleyev.' The rangers said she is well but is struggling more than ever to manage in her home. They helped with repairs during the visit by helicopter and chopped some firewood. One of the cats - a black female called Bagira - has been rehomed and it is hoped the male cat will be found a home soon. Agafya has lived alone since 1988 when her father died. Savvin, 45, Dmitry, 36, and Natalya, 42, all died in 1981 and her mother died in 1961. Family: Karp Lykov, second left, with Dmitry and Agafya, and a Soviet geologist in the 1970s .

When they were discovered by the geologists, the family - apart from Karp - had never seen bread and they spoke in a blurred and distorted language. Their clothes were repaired using hemp cloth and one harsh winter had been reduced to eating leather shoes. But despite the hardship, Agafya has continued to live at the family home and now has two nanny goats, a male goat, eight cats, a rooster, hens and a dog called Taiga.","Agafya Lykova's family fled religious persecution to the remote Siberian taiga .

Historian Sean McGlynn believes the legendary figure was actually William of Kensham . Robin Hood did not rob from the rich to feed the poor in Sherwood Forest, he was a freedom fighter attacking French invaders in Kent, a historian has claimed. The legendary figure, who is said to have resided in the Nottingham area, may have actually been William of Kensham, according to historian Sean McGlynn. William conducted a guerrilla war against the French forces of Prince Louis who invaded England in 1216. Mr McGlynn has suggested that William led a band of archers who attacked the French forces in the forests of the Kent Weald before the little-known 18-month occupation by the French of a large part of England was finally thwarted. Writing in the magazine History Today, Mr McGlynn said: 'Itâs hard to find another contender for the Robin Hood story from this age or afterwards who is both a hero and an outlaw. 'In William we have both: a feted resistance fighter, loyally protecting the crown, but also, from Louisâ perspective, an egregious outlaw defying the righteous rule of the imposed new regime.' The academic said that other contenders for the legend such as Roger Godberd were at the wrong time and were thieves and outlaws that lacked the hero status. He also said that William would have travelled to the Nottingham area because it was the main headquarters of the English army at the time. But Mr McGlynn accepts that William could only be one of many inspirations for the famous story. 'The most probable truth behind the Robin Hood legend is that over time storytellers incorporated and conflated various characters from a range of stories and settled on the instantly recognisable name of Robin Hood as the woodsman.' John Cottee, Committee Chairman for Culture at Nottinghamshire County Council, which manages Sherwood Forest National Nature Reserve, said: 'Robin Hood was a man of the people and his legend is shared today throughout the world, so challenges can come and go, but Nottinghamshire will always celebrate its legendary association with the world's most famous outlaw and continue to conserve the precious remnants of Sherwood Forest where he once roamed.' It is not the first time that historians have speculated on the originator of the Robin Hood story. In 2006, Stephen Lawhead said the medieval outlaw was actually a Welsh freedom fighter who never set foot in Nottingham. Kevin Costner, with Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Maid Marian, famously depicted Robin Hood as Robin of Loxley . Lawhead said the folk hero and his band of merry men . would have carried out their thieving in the Marsh, a primeval . forest in Wales in the 11th century, more than a hundred years . before the English Robin Hood. The English Robin Hood is first mentioned by name in the official documents for Yorkshire of 1230, where he is described as Robertus Hood fugitivis who has failed to appear in court. Many believe him to be nobleman, the Earl of Loxley, who was deprived of his lands by greedy churchmen. Ancient stories tell how he even helped Richard the Lionheart reclaim the throne of England after his return from the Crusades. Since then Kevin Costner and Errol Flynn have both portrayed the legend on the big screen.","Historian Sean McGlynn believes Robin Hood was William of Kensham .

Michael Kitchen's character will return to the screens this month in the eighth series of Foyle's War. The show's creator  Anthony Horowitz met Kitchen and Honeysuckle Weeks, who plays driver Sam Stewart, to decide whether to resurrect the popular series. He told The Observer: 'Michael Kitchen, Honeysuckle and I met 18 months ago to discuss whether it was worth bringing it back. Had we outstayed our welcome?' But after showing pages of plot ideas both actors decided to they wanted to reprise their roles and Weeks said she was also persuaded by the development of her character. The new series set in the Cold War will see DCI Foyle join MI5 spies instead of tackling World War II crime. Mr Horowitz said they had to change setting for the drama because 'we had run out of war'. The series looked to have been no more when it was cancelled in 2007 by ITV director of television Simon Shaps. But it was resurrected after a campaign by viewers who were furious it had been axed.

Evil: Ronald DeFeo shot his entire family dead in the house in 1974, pictured. The Lutzs moved into the home a year later . Amityville kid: Daniel Lutz appears in the documentary about the Amityville haunting, pictured. He was 10 when his family lived there and said they did experience supernatural goings on . The Lutzs - Kathy, her three children Daniel, Christopher and Missy and new husband George - soon reported strange goings on. Kathy said she levitated, saw glowing red eyes and began having nightmares about the murder. George would be woken by strange noises at 3.15am - the time of the murder - while Danny's youngest sister Missy acquired a strange imaginary friend. The family said many of the things that happened there echoed the events of the murder and strange smells, cold drafts and moving objects completed their experiences. A priest who visited the home said he heard a voice telling him to 'Get Out' - later made famous as a soundbite in the movie of their story. The Lutzs tried to bless the house but they said they experienced things that were 'too frightening' to bear repeating that night. They later said they believed DeFeo could have been possessed by the evil lurking in the property. Outside the home: Lutz visits the property in the documentary but doesn't go inside. Another family currently live there . High hopes: The Lutzs received the house at a reduced rate because of the murders that had taken place just a year before . Their story was told in a best-selling book by Jay Anson in 1977. It was made into the famous film starring James Brolin and Margot kidder. Many dismissed them as trying to profit commericialy from made-up experiences. But Danny Lutz's account backs those previously given by his parents, who are now deceased. It also explores his frictional relationship with his stepfather, who his mother later divorced. On the 'paranormal activity' in the house, he says furniture would move around, voices would whisper to him and he experienced 'bodily possession'. The film follows Lutz returning to the house, which is currently occupied by another family, but he doesn't go in. It also shows him refusing to do a polygraph and his anger at experts who believe his experiences could be a case of false memory. The documentary's maker Eric Walter said the film is much more about what it was like to be the Amityville Kid rather than retelling the Lutzs horror stories. 'He's been carrying around this weight for nearly 40 years,' he told the Wall Street Journal. 'It's not easy to talk about.' 'People being haunted by a haunting is not something I had seen before. The evidence we can present is this man's life, everything that has happened for the last 40 yearsâit comes down to a family story and it's quite tragic.' Danny's siblings didn't want to appear in the film. Christopher is writing a book on the subject and Missy has never spoken about their time in Amityville.","Danny Lutz, who was 10 when his family moved into 112 Ocean Avenue, has spoken for the first time about what happened in the house .

It may not leave James Bond shaken and stirred but this Aston Martin DB6 is set to sell for more than Â£400,000 - despite being an estate car rather than a sleeker number. Only six of the models were ever produced after Aston Martin boss David Brown wanted a sports car with room for his shotguns and dogs to take on his regular hunting trips. His team of designers came up with the 1965 Aston Martin DB6 Vantage Shooting Brake. The rare Aston Martin, converted into an estate car, is up for sale at a Florida auction house this week .

Bespoke coachbuilders Radford & Co then converted the six Aston Martin DB6s into the longer and larger versions of the vehicle. Although the front looks like a classic Aston Martin, its rear end is large and practical with plenty of space in the boot. Now the car is worth twice as much as its DB6 cousin. It has air conditioning and has powerful and superior Vantage specifications. The Aston Martin, which has an all-aluminium straight six engine, will be auctioned by Bonhams auctioneers in Florida this week. The car is believed to have been ordered in 1967 or 1968 by a James Harrison, of Madison Avenue, New York, which is why it is a left hand drive. A Bonhams spokesman said: 'This DB6 was clearly used in the UK as it carried a British registration. 'Close inspection of the car reveals a remarkably original and unspoilt car. A DB6 complete with roof rack is an unusual find - hence the expected sale price of Â£400,000 . The original leather interior is still intact in this customised left hand drive . It may not be as sleek as the more familiar Aston Martin, but being only one of six, it's worth twice as much as its cousins . 'The original leather beige interior remains in place and from stem to stern the car has the feeling of being as it was when its conversion was finished, complete with period luggage rack on its roof. 'As Aston Martin values continue to escalate, it is the rarest variants that are the most sought-after and in that respect, they don't come much better than this.

The mistress: French first lady Valerie Trierweiler was accused of 'embezzlement' because she is using taxpayers' money while not actually married . The French first lady was today accused of âembezzlementâ because she is using taxpayersâ money while not actually married. In a criminal case which places a question mark against President Francois Hollandeâs decision to have a live-in-lover, Miss Trierweiler is described as nothing more than a âmistressâ. Xavier Kemlin, a multi-millionaire Frenchman, insists that the 48-year-old magazine journalist âshould not take advantageâ of public funds. He has filed the complaint at a criminal court in Saint-Etienne, in the Loire department of eastern France. It . states that the presidential couple âare neither married, nor civil . partners,â and that âour taxesâ should not have to âhouse, feed, pay the . staff and travel of a woman with whom taxpayers have âno link in lawâ. Despite being an avowed Socialist, Mr . Trierweiler has become noted for her luxury lifestyle since moving into . the Elysee Palace last year. She not only has access to official homes, cars and planes, but also retains her own office and staff. Mr . Kemlin, a French taxpayer who lives in Switzerland, is furious at the . huge increases in charges being introduced by her husbandâs government. They include a proposed 75 per cent top rate of income tax. Mr .

Last . year it emerged that Ms Trierweiler was once the shared mistress of Mr . Hollande and married conservative minister, Patrick Devedjian â all . while she was still married to her second husband.

A second by second account by Aldrin . of the fraught final minutes as the module approached the lunar surface is . also included in the sale. History in the making: Instruction sheets used by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin for the first Moon landing . One small step:Â  Aldrin, left on the lunar surface, used the notes, right, while Armstrong piloted the module . It reveals the first words spoken on the surface were by Aldrin, who said 'contact light' to confirm touch down, and not Neil Armstrong with his famous quote: 'One small step for man...' The primary guidance and navigation papers have computer procedures on how to perform the lunar lift-off to enable the pair to leave the Moon. The papers would also have shown the astronauts how to lift off from the Moon in an emergency. Aldrin is selling the sheets after a change in the law last year paved the way for Apollo astronauts to retain legal ownership of items they kept from their historic missions. The sheets will be sold by Bonhams auctioneers in New York on March 25. A letter by Aldrin which accompanies the sheets tells just how dramatic the famous Moon landing was. Final frontier: Aldrin poses for a photograph by the U.S. flag after landing on the Moon in 1969 . Star gazing: The Apollo 11 crew, Neil Armstrong (left), Buzz Aldrin (right) and Michael Collins (centre) In the letter Aldrin describes the moment an alarm sounded as the astronauts were close to landing.

Auction: Aldrin is putting his papers up for sale . Aldrin's letter states: 'The lunar . landing was an experience I will always remember ... some eight minutes . into our descent engine burn, we started our most challenging part of . the landing - the approach phase sequence. 'We were behind on flight tasks due to the distractions caused by the alarms. Neil was monitoring our instruments and the visual view out his window. 'Neil's flying tasks suddenly became more complicated because the computer was sending us into a large crater containing and surrounded by boulders. 'At about 500 feet above the lunar surface, Neil Armstrong entered the commands to manually fly Eagle to the lunar surface with computer support. 'He slowed the descent rate to just a few feet per second and studied the surrounding terrain.'Neil asked me about our fuel status and I indicated we had eight per cent remaining. 'I was then able to glance outside and began to understand why the landing sequence was taking longer than planned - the craters, rocks and boulders seemed to be everywhere. 'Mission Control radioed we had '60 seconds' of fuel remaining. Then '30 seconds' rang in our headsets. 'Neil was almost to the surface when a haze of dust was kicked up by engine exhaust. He could not see the surface and had to locate something just above the dust cloud. Moonraker: Aldrin walking on the surface of the Moon after climbing out of the Eagle module . Man on the moon: Historic moment as Neil Armstrong's right foot leaves a print in the lunar soil . 'Finally Neil was able to see a rock that appeared fixed in the stream of dust. This gave him a surface reference. 'Just as Neil placed Eagle gently on the lunar surface, I spoke the first words from the Moon: 'CONTACT LIGHT!' This was the indicator light on our control panel that told us that Eagle had touched the lunar surface. To boldly go: The Apollo 11 mission sets off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida . 'We only had about 20 seconds of fuel remaining onboard.' Aldrin and Armstrong were joined on the mission by Michael Collins, who orbited the Moon in the command spacecraft while they made their way to the surface. Matthew Haley, specialist in space history at Bonhams, said: 'Apollo 11 is pretty much the high point of the American space programme and the highlight of space exploration full stop as it was the first manned lunar landing. 'These documents have been to the Moon and back are the equivalent of Christoper Columbus's logbook. 'They might appeal to an institution but this market is very much dominated by private collectors. 'The cards are pretty technical so having the letter from Buzz Aldrin with them is the icing on the cake as it helps explain just how relevant the cards were. 'The key points are the printed text about the powered ascent, when they come back from the surface of the Moon after becoming the first people to step on it. 'They would have been getting instructions from Mission Control throughout, hence the annotations.'","Papers were part of Aldrin's own manual used during 1969 lunar landing .

Xi Jinping was today officially appointed as president of China, sealing his position as the most powerful man in the world's largest country. The new leader, who has taken over from Hu Jintao, will be charged with promoting the 'Chinese Dream' which will propel hundreds of millions of China's citizens into the middle class over the coming decades. The ruling Communist Party hopes that China's growing economic will help it become more powerful than the West, with some analysts predicting that the country will overtake the U.S. and Europe by 2030. Since coming to prominence last year, Xi has made a point of spending time with poor Chinese in an attempt to reassure them that they will share in the country's growth and enter the middle class.

Xi's promotion came as no surprise after the former vice-president was named head of the Communist Party . and chairman of the Chinese military last November. 'I'm . very happy. With President Xi leading us, China will be more prosperous . and more powerful,' said Zhang Rihong, one of the 3,000 delegates to . the National People's Congress in Beijing. Though . Xi, 59, is now formally in charge, big challenges remain for him within the . party's top ranks - in which powerful people are often divided by . patronage, ideology or financial interests. He . has pledged to tackle the endemic graft which he says is detrimental to . the party's survival, according to Willy Lam, a China politics watcher . at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

Handover: Xi is taking power at a crucial period for the global superpower . New boss: Xi walks to the stage to cast his vote in the presidential election which he won . Xi Jinping, the most powerful man in China, is a 59-year-old Communist Party loyalist and son of a famous revolutionary leader. He was born in 1953 to Xi Zhongxun, a political leader who helped overthrow China's government in 1949 and later held a number of senior positions. Xi grew up in Beijing and studied chemical engineering at Tsinghua University, joining the Communist Party at the age of 21. As is customary, he spent many years as a party official in various provincial areas - but also visited a small town in Iowa to research American agriculture. Xi's big breakthrough came in 2000 when he was appointed governor of Fujian province, subsequently becoming party chief in Zhejiang and then Shanghai. In 2007 he was appointed to the all-powerful Standing Committee of the Politburo, and became vice-president the next year, putting him first in line to take the top job during the handover of power to the next generation which took place last November. Graft is deeply ingrained in the party's patronage-based culture and those at the top - many of whose families have benefited from their political connections - are believed to be most resistant to anti-corruption measures that diminish their prerogatives. 'He has to walk a fine line,' Lam said. 'If he were really serious about going after senior cadres, he might establish his authority within the rank and file. However, that would also jeopardize his relationship with the power blocs and with the holders of vested interests.' Xi's accession marks only the second orderly transfer of power in more than six decades of Communist Party rule. He . was the only candidate for president in Thursday's ballot in the . country's figurehead parliament. The delegates voted 2,952-to-1 for Xi . in a political ritual designed to echo the views of the party . leadership. After the result was announced, Xi . bowed to delegates and turned to Hu, seated next to him. The two of them . shook hands and posed for photos. Xi, . the son of a veteran political leader instrumental in the progress of . China's revolution, was also appointed chairman of the government . commission that oversees the military. Li . Yuanchao, a liberal-minded reformer and a close ally of Hu, was named . vice-president. Controversially, Li is not in the party's seven-member . ruling inner sanctum.

'At present, the party and the government have very little public credibility,' said Zhang Ming, a China politics expert at the prestigious Renmin University in Beijing. 'The way to regain credibility is to at least show some results, but at this point that can't be seen and I predict there won't be any real results later.' Ahead of the votes on the government's top slots, legislators approved a government restructuring plan only four days after it was introduced. Among other things, the plan abolishes the Railways Ministry and combines two agencies that regulate newspapers and broadcasters into a super media regulator. It also merges the Health Ministry with the commission that oversees the one-child law. In a reflection of China's growing international engagement, the role of president has evolved since the 1990s from being purely ceremonial to a position which lends legitimacy to the government and draws attention away from the Communist Party. 'As China opens up and becomes more engaged in the international community, it's just impractical, it's not convenient, for a party head to meet a foreign head of state,' said Warren Sun, an expert on Communist Party history at Monash University in Australia.

Xi effectively became the country's top leader in mid-November after ascending to the helm of the ruling Communist Party, which holds ultimate power in China. The son of a revolutionary veteran, Xi cuts an authoritative figure with a confidence and congeniality that was lacking in his predecessor, the aloof and stiff Hu. He quickly moved to court the military after taking over from Hu as head of the party's Central Military Commission, making high-profile visits to naval, air force and infantry bases. Xi has also sought to please other constituencies. He made a trip to the south to show he's interested in economic reforms, repeatedly stated his staunch belief in party power to appeal to hardliners, visited the poor to burnish his common-man credentials and espoused the 'Chinese Dream' to tap into middle class aspirations. But for Xi to consolidate his power within the party, he will come up against various interest groups such as the sons and daughters of communist China's founding fathers who want to keep benefiting from their connections, or those with links to banks and state industries who don't want their privileged positions threatened. Ideologically, there are those who believe China needs an even stronger, more authoritarian government that promotes more egalitarian economic and social policies. Others want a transition to more democratic government.","59-year-old takes over from Hu Jintao as China's head of state .

An Iowa City police officer has helped deliver a baby on the side of the road, after pulling over its father who was speeding on the way to the hospital. Officer Kevin Wolfe stopped the vehicle on Sunday night, and the panicked driver jumped out and yelled, 'Sir, we're delivering a baby right here, right now!' Wolfe said that by the time he reached the passenger door of the couple's black SUV, the baby's head and arms were already out. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Special delivery: Iowa City police officer Kevin Wolfe, pictured, pulled over a speeding SUV on Sunday night then helped the driver and his passenger deliver a baby . The six-year police force veteran assisted in the final stages of the delivery and wrapped the child in a blanket. He then escorted the family, who haven't been named and didn't want to be interviewed, to Mercy Iowa City hospital, two blocks from where the child was delivered. Wolfe, whose dashboard camera captured the incredible episode, said he had not expected a baby to be born right there on the roadside. Speeding: Wolfe pulled over the black SUV, pictured, after he noticed it speeding . Father: The driver of the SUV, pictured, told the police officer 'Sir, we're delivering a baby right here, right now' 'I had every expectation that when they said they were having a baby they meant there was a baby on the way and we would drive to the hospital and I would shake their hand and say ""good luck.""' he said. 'But the baby's head and arms were already out.' The baby, the couple's third child, can be heard crying on the police tape. The shocked, and hardworking, mother repeatedly yells 'Oh my God' as her little one is born with only a few pushes. Radio: Wolfe, pictured in his dash camera video, radioed in the bizarre occurrence to the station . Final stages: The police officer, pictured, said the baby's head and arms were already out but he helped in the final stages . 'Congratulations, this my first one on the road so,' Wolfe can be heard telling the couple. Later he told KCRG.com: 'I think everybody was equally surprised. I'd say it's pretty crazy, this one I'll be telling for a while.' The mother and newborn were discharged from the hospital on Wednesday and are said to be in good health.

Discovered just six days ago, asteroid 2013 ET passed 600,000 miles from Earth at 8 30pm GMT. It was about 2.5 times as far away as the moon, which in space terms is a close shave. 'The scary part of this one is that it's something we didn't even know about,' said Patrick Paolucci, president of the Slooh Space Camera, commenting on live images of the asteroid flying past taken from a telescope in the Canary Islands. Scroll down for video . Through the telescope: Asteroid 2013 ET as seen from the Canary Islands on March 9th as it sped by Earth . No warning: No one had realised the asteroid, which was as big as a football pitch was going to pass so close to the Earth until six days ago but astronomers on the Canary Islands captured the image . Moving at a speed of about 26,000 miles per hour, the asteroid could have wiped out a large city if it had hit the Earth, added Slooh telescope engineer Paul Cox. Two other small asteroids, both about the size of the Russian meteor, will also be in Earth's neighborhood this weekend. Asteroid 2013 EC 20 passed just 93,000 miles away on Saturday, which Cox explained is 'a stone's throw' from Earth. On Sunday, Asteroid 2013 EN 20 will fly about 279,000 miles from Earth. Both were discovered just three days ago. 'We know that the solar system is a busy place,' said Cox.'We're not sitting here on our pale, blue dot on our own in nice safety.' 'This should be a wake up call to governments.' Asteroid sightings: Scientists say we are seeing many more these days as astronomers watch the skies from all over the world, like this footage from the Virtual Telescope Project in Ceccano, Italy, of Monday's asteroid . These three are part of a series of space debris to pass near the earth recently. Asteroid 2013 ET, which passed on Saturday night, was nearly eight times larger than the bus-sized asteroid that exploded on February 15 over Chelyabinsk, Russia. The force of the explosion, equivalent to about 440 kilotons of dynamite, created a shock wave that shattered windows and damaged buildings, injuring more than 1,500 people. 1,200 were injured when an untracked lump of space rock exploded over the Urals in Russia on February 15 2013 . The rock hit the atmosphere at a speed of at least 33,000mph . The 10,000-ton lump of space rock exploded, creating a âsonic boomâ that shattered windows and rocked buildings . On the same day another smaller asteroid called DA14 passed closer to the Earth than communications and weather satellites . The last time something major struck the Earth was in 1908, when an asteroid about 50 metres wide exploded over Siberia . About 100 tons of material from space hit Earth every day. A bright comet show is also now on the way -Comet ISON may come close to outshining the moon in November . Later that day, another small asteroid, known as DA14, passed about 17,200 miles (27,680 km) from Earth, closer than the orbiting networks of communications and weather satellites. NASA has been ordered by the U.S. Congress to find and track all near-Earth objects 0.62 miles or larger in diameter, and estimates about 95 percent have been identified. However, only about 10 percent of smaller asteroids have been discovered, NASA scientists have said. The effort is intended to give scientists and engineers as much time as possible to discover if an asteroid or comet is on a collision course with Earth, in hopes of sending up a spacecraft to avert catastrophe. Astronomers currently expect an object about the size of what hit Russia to strike the planet about every 100 years. Near miss: The meteor is seen above a residential apartment block in the Urals city of Chelyabinsk in a video shot last month .","Three asteroids passed close by this weekend .

Mrs Wright said she wanted to promote non-violence in the school and the soldiers could be seen to breach that. 'These are toys that were commonplace in the past. However, some parents prohibit all guns as toys. In light of that difference, the school offered to replace the soldiers with another item and the soldiers were returned home with the student,' she said. 'In the climate of recent events in schools we walk a delicate balance in teaching non-violence in our buildings and trying to ensure a safe, peaceful atmosphere.

Living in a democratic society entails respect for opposing opinions. 'By not permitting toy soldiers on cupcakes at school, no disrespect for our military or for the brave men and women who defend our rights to have our differences was intended. 'Our commitment is always to our children and creating a safe place for them to learn, grow and have respectful dialogues about their differences.' Many people have come forward to support the Fountains after the school's decision. One commentator took to Twitter to say the move was 'the definition of insanity'.

First Lady Michelle Obama has appeared on the cover ofÂ Vogue magazine for the second time, talking about family values and pushing back at critics who say she and the president need to socialize more. Mrs Obama, 49, was captured in the April 2013 issue of the magazine - which hits newsstands on March 26 - by famed photographer Annie Leibovitz. She first appeared on the cover of Vogue in March 2009 - right after her husband was inaugurated for his first term. Cover girl: First Lady Michelle Obama has appeared on her second cover of Vogue magazine, for the April 2013 issue that will hit newsstands on March 26 . In an open, and assertive stance, she leans against a table and looks directly into the cameraâs lens with her bare arms resting at her side. Wearing a Reed Krakoff dress, taken from her own closet, in cerulean blue with a flourish of purple at the neckline, Mrs Obama looks comfortable, at ease, and happy. By contrast, for Mrs Obamaâs debut appearance on the Vogue cover in March 2009, she sat curled on a sofa with her arms lightly wrapped one over the other in a protective gesture; and the discomfort in her facial expression is palpable. In the accompanying interview, by Jonathan Van Meter, the First Lady summarizes her relationship . to fashion. Her style is mentioned only once in the profile, and in . just one paragraph - insinuating perhaps that she has more important . things on her mind. Picture perfect: Mrs Obama, wearing the same reed Krakoff dress, poses with the President; the smiling couple are draped over one-and-other affectionately . 'I always say that women should wear . whatever makes them feel good about themselves. Thatâs what I always try . to do,' she explained. 'I also believe that if youâre . comfortable in your clothes itâs easy to connect with people and make . them feel comfortable as well. In every interaction that I have with . people, I always want to show them my most authentic self.' For the new issue, she wears the same . dress for the inside feature with the President, who is dressed in a . pinstriped shirt and a striped blue tie. Mrs Obama's choice of Reed . Krakoff for . the cover is a significant one - she also wore the label in her latest . official portrait, and for the President's swearing-in. Flashback: Mrs Obama graced the March issue of Vogue in 2009 . In the picture, the smiling couple . are draped over one-and-other - the president's arm on his wife's knee . and her long arms placed affectionately around his neck. A . third photograph captures her in profile, wearing a black slim-fitting . Michael Kors long-sleeve top and fishtail ball skirt - a picture of . sporty elegance. Michael Kors has become one of Mrs Obama's most popular go-to choices; she has frequently worn his designs since her entry into The White House five years ago, and even posed for her first official portrait wearing a . sleeveless Kors shift. For much of the interview, the first . lady discusses their family values, explaining that she and the . President were straightforward when they said - before moving from . Chicago to Washington in 2009 - that their family, including two young . daughters Malia and Sasha, would be their priority. She said 'the stresses and the . pressures' of the White House are so real that they prefer to spend free . time with their daughters, now 14 and 11. 'Our job is, first and foremost, to make sure our family is whole. You know, we have small kids; they're growing every day,' Mrs Obama said in the interview. 'But I think we were both pretty straightforward when we said, ""Our No. 1 priority is making sure that our family is whole.""' She . noted that most of the couple's friends are parents, too, and that when . she and the president go on vacation, usually with longtime friends or . relatives, they are surrounded by children. 'The stresses and the pressures of . this job are so real that when you get a minute, you want to give that . extra energy to your 14- and 11-year-old,' the First Lady said. Keeping it blue: At the inauguration . ceremony at the White House in January, she also chose a silk dress by . Reed Krakoff - the eponymous label set up by Coach's former creative . head in 2010 . Twice as nice: Mrs Obama wore Michael Kors at a Foundation dinner in September last year (left); a . dress she first wore on in June at a dinner with Israeli President . Shimon Peres (right) The President joked in the Vogue interview that . he and the First Lady might start hitting the town, now that their . daughters are older and have less time for them. 'As I joked at a press conference, . now that they want less time with us, who knows? Maybe you'll see us out . in the clubs,' Obama said. Mrs Obama added that '90 per cent' of . what she and the President talk about has to do with the girls: what . they're up to, who has practice, which one of their friends is having a . birthday party and did they get that person a gift - conversation she . described as 'endless' and 'pretty exhausting.' 'The Secret Service had to change the way they do things... Because they want to make sure these girls are happy and have a normal life' She suggested that neither one of . them wants to miss any of it. Obama grew up without his father and has . talked publicly about his desire to be there for his kids. 'He's . doing it while still dealing with Syria and health care. He's as up on . every friend, every party, every relationship,' the First Lady said. 'And if you're out to dinner every . night, you miss those moments where you can check-in and just figure . them out when they're ready to share with you.' Mrs Obama also talked about the struggle to give their growing daughters a 'normal life.' She . said: 'The Secret Service has to change the way they do things; they . have to become more flexible. And they do. Because they want to make . sure that these girls are happy and that they have a normal life. 'Thereâs a lot of energy that goes . into working with staff, working with agents, working with friendsâ parents to figure out how do we, you know, let these kids go to the . party and have a sleepover and walk through the city on their own, go to . the game. 'It requires us to be there and be present so that we can respond and have the system respond to their needs,' she explained. Fashion forward: Mrs Obama uses her incredible . sense of style as a powerful tool, often shining the spotlight on . up-and-coming American designers . Power woman:Â  Mrs Obama's appearance in Vogue comes just months after her husband secured re-election; she was lauded for Tom Browne coat and matching dress . Family values: The first lady opens up about family values in the Vogue feature, pushing back at critics who say she and the president need to socialize more . Discussing their 20-year marriage, the president reveals: 'Thereâs no doubt Iâm a better man having spent time with Michelle. I would never say that Michelleâs a better woman, but I will say sheâs a little more patient.' Mrs Obama responded with a smile: 'I would say Iâm a better woman.' The pair also touch on how being in The White House has had an effect on their wardrobes. The President says he went from having only two suits, to dozens. 'Thank god,' said Mrs Obama. 'Let me tell you: This is the man who still boasts about, ""This khaki pair of pants Iâve had since I was 20."" And Iâm like, ""You donât want to brag about that.""' Laughing, the President added: 'Michelleâs like BeyoncÃ© in that song, ""Let me upgrade ya!"" She upgraded me.' Mrs Obama is the second First Lady to appear on a Vogue cover. Hillary Clinton appeared in the magazine in 1998. Vogue's editor, Anna Wintour, was a top fundraiser for the Obama re-election campaign, raking in more than $500,000. Last year, it was rumored that Wintour was tapped to be the Obama administration's ambassador to London as a result of those efforts, however those rumors were put to rest yesterday when it was announced she had been promoted to 'artistic director' of CondÃ© Nast.","April 2013 cover shot by famed photographer Annie Leibovitz .

Hundreds of people fell ill with a stomach virus on an 11-day Royal Caribbean International cruise ship that returned to South Florida Friday. The cruise line reported that 105 of nearly 2,000 passengers were sickened with possible Norovirus, as well as 3 of 772 crew members. The ship captain announced the outbreak shortly after the vessel, called the 'Vision of the Seas,' departed. Dozens of passengers experiencing the symptoms were quarantined. One of those passengers was Johnny Celaire, who said he caught the virus early on and spent the duration of the trip separated from his wife in the quarantined portion of the ship.

Not happy: 'ItÂ¿s been a hell of an experience,' passenger Johnny Celaire said of the trip . 'Itâs been a hell of an experience,' Celaire told CBS Miami. 'I thought I had motion sickness. I assumed because we had rough ocean coming in for about one hour. It was after that when I got diarrhea I said, ""Oh boy, Iâve really got that sucker now.""' The outbreak is the second time in a month that a luxury cruise has gone awry. Last month, thousands of passengers . spent nearly five days on a disabled cruise ship operated by Carnival . Corp in the Gulf of Mexico. Carnival's . Triumph was returning to Galveston, Texas from Cozumel, Mexico, on the . third day of a four-day cruise when an engine-room fire knocked out . power and plumbing across most of the ship. Celaire and his wife, Joan Webber, said they saw crew members trying to sanitize every inch of the ship but the virus was so contagious, it couldn't be contained. 'We saw them wiping down all the railings,' Webber said. 'I mean theyâve done well at trying to contain it, but itâs just gone wild.' Norovirus is highly contagious and causes severe diarrhea and vomiting. The disease typically lasts only a few days but can be prolonged without proper hydration. Infected: Joan Webber said she didn't begin feeling the symptoms of the virus until Friday, so she wasn't quarantined . Cleaning: The cruise ship was sanitized on Friday and set to depart for another cruise .

Webber . said she didn't begin feeling the symptoms of the virus until Friday, . so she wasn't quarantined. She said she was concerned about all the . infected passengers who will be traveling by cab to local hotels or by . plane back home. 'There are people flying out today that are going on an aircraft that have diarrhea so bad they donât know how they are going to get back up to Canada,' Webber said. 'Iâm surprised we didnât go and have the health department talk to us.' The cruise line said in a statement that crew members conducted enhanced cleaning to help prevent the spread of the illness. After returning to port, crew members aboard the Vision of the Seas conducted an extensive and thorough sanitizing on board the ship and within the cruise terminal to help prevent future illness, according to the statement. Built to impress: The 915-foot-long Vision of the Seas can accommodate 2,416 guests and 742 crew members . The vessel was ending an 11-night Caribbean cruise that left Port Everglades on Feb. 25. Its previous port of call was Aruba on March 5 . Norovirus outbreaks are fairly frequent . on cruise ships. In December, some 194 passengers and 11 crew members . aboard the luxury cruise ship Queen Mary 2 were sickened and suffered . from vomiting and diarrhea. In 2012, including the Queen Mary 2 incident, a total of 16 outbreaks on cruise ships were reported to the U.S. Center for Disease Control, up from 14 in 2011. Vessels are required to notify the agency when 2 percent of those on board develop a gastrointestinal illness. In January 2012, the Costa Concordia operated by Carnival Corp ran aground off the Italian coast and killed 32 passengers.

Freedom: Killer Matthew Richardson, who now goes by the name of Maxine, pictured on weekend release from prison . A killer who stabbed to death a prostitute who mocked his performance as a male kissogram has been spotted enjoying a temporary release from prison - as a woman. Matthew Richardson, 55, who was jailed for life in 1986 for murdering 65-year-old prostitute Margaret Bolingbroke, has been undergoing female hormone replacement treatment while behind bars. Richardson, who is now known as Maxine, was spotted boarding a London-bound train while on weekend release with long blonde hair and pink lipstick and wearing a fur-lined hat and leather jacket on Friday. The killer was one of a group of prisoners dropped off by a minibus at a station close to Blantyre House in Goudhurst, Kent. One onlooker told the Sunday Mirror: 'He looked happy to be out of prison and was very relaxed. 'Although he was wrapped up because of the cold he stood out of the crowd because of the blonde hair and lipstick. 'People walking past were doing a double take, especially when they heard his voice.' Richardson made headlines in 2011 when it was revealed that he was to have a Â£45,000 sex change operation on the NHS. The news angered the Taxpayers' Alliance back then who called it 'unfair that law-abiding patients face a postcode lottery for care.' But prisoners are entitled to the same range of NHS treatments, including those for gender reassignment, as non-offenders. He was seen dressed in woman's clothes at the time while helping out at a charity shop in Maidstone, Kent as part of his rehabilitation. Richardson is yet to have the operation, according to the Sunday Mirror. Now and then: Matthew Richardson pictured on Friday, left, and prior to going to jail, right . Although Blantyne House is classed as a mens' prison, Government guidelines brought in in 2011 decreed that jails must allow inmates who wish to undergo a sex change to live in their acquired gender. The prisoner was initially jailed in 1986 but tried to appeal his conviction in 1991. Though it was initially quashed, a retrial found him guilty again and he was sent back to jail in 1992. He is due for permanent release from jail this week.

Several anti-Islamic ads featuring the photographs and quotes of Osama bin Laden, the Times Square Bomber, and the alleged Fort Hood shooter have caused outrage in San Francisco after their release today. The ads, which will run for the next month, are featured on 10 buses in the Bay Area and have caused a stir in the community, sparking a fierce debate between free speech and hate speech. The ads were paid for by the American Freedom Defense Initiative. One of the spots contains a quote attributed to Hamas, the militant Islamic group, and reads: âKilling Jews is worship that brings us closer to Allah.â Controversial: A month-long campaign paid for by the the American Freedom Defense Initiative will be featured on 10 of San Francisco's buses for the next month; here, the same campaign in Chicago . Strongly worded: Similar ads appeared in the Washington D.C. Metro stations featuring former al Qaeda leader Osama bin Ladin . Beliefs: Pamela Geller serves as the president of AFDI and has launched several ad campaigns . Another ad features Osama bin Ladenâs explanation of why he decided to take down the Twin Towers on 9/11. âThe first thing we are calling you to is Islam,â the quote reads. It is accompanied by a picture of the former Al Qaeda leader, who was killed in a covert operation a year and a half ago. Yet another shows would-be Times Square bomber Faisal Shahzad and says how jihad involving âweaponryâ is an âobligation and duty in Islam on every Muslim.â San Francisco civil officials and Arab and Muslim leaders alike were quick to denounce what they said was âracistâ and offensive ads. District Attorney George Gascon told the Associated Press today that the ads were âoffensiveâ and âserve no purpose than to denigrate our cities Arab and Muslim communities.â Mayor Ed Lee added, 'San Francisco is a city that celebrates its diversity and hateful speech and discrimination against our Arab and Muslim communities will never be tolerated.' Board of Supervisors president David Chiu was expected to introduce a resolution on Tuesday condemning the ads. Condemned: Officials have spoken out against the campaign, which also features Major Nidal Malik Hasan, M.D., a U.S. Army psychiatrist who is the sole suspect in the 2009 Ft Hood shootings . Similar ads have appeared on transit systems in Washington, D.C., Chicago and Portland, Oregon. The group ran similar ads in San Francisco in August and has also posted ads in New York City, including one in September that called enemies of Israel 'savages.' Officials with San Francisco's Municipal Transportation Authority believe a First Amendment court decision protecting freedom of speech means it must accept the advertising. As it did last summer, the transit agency plans to give the $5,000 paid for the ads to the city's Human Rights Commission to study the impact of discrimination on San Francisco's Islamic communities and run its own ads against discrimination. Convicted: Another ad features would-be Times Square bomber Faisal Shahzad . AFDI executive director Pamela Gellar said in a statement Tuesday that Americans âneed to understand the threat theyâre facing,â adding: âThat is the point of our ads. The slaughter of Christians in Nigeria, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Malaysia, Algeria, et alâ¦ Hundreds of thousands dead, but it would be blasphemy to talk about.â Messages sent to Geller by MailOnline were not immediately returned. The AFDI âJihad Awareness CampaignâÂ  that has raised just over $1,200 of a $50,000 goal.

A 20-year-old man died from swine flu and pneumonia after a senior nurse at NHS Direct told him to go to the chemist instead of A&E. The unnamed man, known only as Patient A, had called the hotline twice in two days complaining of diarrhoea and vomiting for six . days. He also described a chesty cough and . discoloured mucous. But rather than following the advice on the computer, which said the man should go to A&E, Fadzai Jaravaza, a senior nurse advisor for NHS Direct Essex, instead told the  caller to get cough syrup from the chemist and treat himself. Wrong diagnosis: A 20-year-old man died from swine flu and pneumonia on after a senior nurse at NHS Direct told him to go to the chemist instead of A&E . Ms Jaravaza, . 59, from Wickford, Essex, will now be struck off the nursing register . after being found guilty of a string of professional misconduct charges . by a Nursing and Midwifery Council fitness to practice panel. This was one of seven counts of misconduct taken into consideration by the panel. Other accusations included failing to provide the correct care to patients complaining of chest pain, palpitations and breathing difficulties. The panel heard that on Christmas Day 2010 she ignored advice from the system that the Patient A should go straight to A&E due to the severity of his symptoms. With NHS Direct, operators offer advice based on the symptoms described through a computer system. The panel's report of the hearing said: 'On both occasions, Ms Jaravaza advised that Patient A should seek pharmacy advice and self-medicate.' The panel was informed that Patient A . was admitted to hospital the following day, Boxing Day, but died later . that day following a provisional diagnosis of pneumonia secondary to . H1N1 influenza (swine flu). The report added: 'There is evidence of lack of insight and a lack of engagement. Further, the panel considers that there is a real risk of repetition of Ms Jaravaza's failings which could lead to patient harm.' Struck off: Ms Jaravaza was deemed no longer fit to practice at a hearing of the Nursing and Midwifery Council . Indeed, the panel heard that Ms Jaravaza had been monitored by managers since March that year after a series of unsatisfactory calls. The report continued: 'It is the panel's finding that a period of suspension would not be sufficient to protect patients. 'The panel considers that a striking off order is the only sanction that is sufficient to protect patients and the public interest. 'The seriousness of the case, including the number and wide-ranging nature of the incidents, is incompatible with ongoing registration.' Ms Jaravaza, who worked for NHS Direct since 2001, claimed during the probe that the problems were down to changes with the system in 2009. She is also said to have refused to cooperate with the investigation or attend the hearing in London. She was given 28 days to appeal the decision before the strike off.","Unnamed patient called hotline due to diarrhoea and vomiting, chesty cough and discoloured mucous .

Switching off a 'fat' gene could prevent you from piling on the pound even if you stick to a high-fat diet, say researchers. A two-year study found that removing this gene in mice made them resistant to obesity. The animals showed unusual restraint when fed a high-calorie diet and were more active as well. 'When fed a diet that induces obesity . these mice donât get fat,' said study author Professor James McManaman from the University of Colorado. 'It may be . possible to duplicate this in humans using existing technology that . targets this specific gene.' The absence of the gene may cause fat to be broken down faster by the body, he said. The research team created a strain of mice without the Plin2 gene, which humans also possess. It produces a protein that regulates fat storage and metabolism. They found their fat cells were 20 per cent smaller than typical mice and did not show the kind of inflammation usually associated with obesity. Obesity-associated fatty liver disease, common in obese humans and rodents alike, was absent in the mice without the Plin2 gene. 'The mice were healthier,' Prof McManaman said. Fat cells were 20 per cent smaller in mice without the Plin2 gene . 'They had lower triglyceride levels, they were more insulin-sensitive, they had no incidents of fatty liver disease and there was less inflammation in the fat cells.' The findings suggest switching off the Plin2 gene may lower the risk of heart disease (triglycerides are fatty molecules involved in the hardening of the arteries) and diabetes. 'It could mean that we have finally . discovered a way to disrupt obesity in humans. That would be a . major breakthrough,' Prof McManaman. The team next want to know how the gene alteration works physiologically and better understand how it affects food consumption. According to the study, understanding how Plin2 is involved in the control of energy balance will provide new insights into 'the mechanisms by which nutrition overload is detected, and how individuals adapt to, or fail to adapt to, dietary challenges.' The study, funded by the . National Institutes of Health was published in The Journal of Lipid Research.","Removing Plin2 gene made mice resistant to obesity .

Green light: The drugs, previously considered too expensive for NHS patients, was given the go-ahead by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence .

"By ANTHONY BOND . UPDATED: . 06:08 EST, 8 October 2011 . A young Syrian woman believed to have been beheaded and skinned by security agents while in custody has stunned the country by appearing on Syrian state TV today. International human rights groups and Syrian activists reported last month that 18-year-old Zainab al-Hosni was found mutilated after being detained. Human rights activists said she was the first woman to die in Syrian custody since the uprising against Syrian President Bashar Assad began in mid-March. Broadcast: An image of the woman who claims to be 18-year old Zainab al-Hosni. She was previously reported to have been beheaded and mutilated by Syrian security agents while in custody . She quickly became a symbol of the Syrian uprising, with protesters in Homs hailing her as . the 'flower of Syria.' The apparent death confirmed what . witnesses and the U.N. human rights office said was a fearsome new . tactic of retaliating against protesters' families. However Syrian TV today showed a black-clad young woman who identified herself as 18-year-old Zainab al-Hosni from Homs. Boost: If the woman who appeared on Syrian state TV is confirmed as Zainab al-Hosni it will be a huge boost for President Bashar Assad and his government . The interview was designed to discount what the channel said were foreign 'media fabrications.' The woman in the broadcast said she had run away from her family home in late July because her brothers allegedly abused her. She claimed she wanted to speak out after hearing on TV that she had been arrested and beheaded. She added that her family did not know that she was alive and asked her mother for forgiveness. 'I am very much alive and I have opted to tell the truth because I am planning to get married in the future and have kids who I want to be registered,' she said. Hope: Syrians have been protesting against Bashar Assad's government since mid-March . Amnesty International said in a statement: 'We have seen the reports that have aired on Syria TV suggesting that Zainab al-Hosni is alive. 'We are currently looking into this case working with trusted sources in the country.' Last month, Amnesty said the mutilated teenager had reportedly been detained by security agents to pressure her activist brother to turn himself in. Al-Hosni's native central city of Homs is one of the hotbeds of the uprising. She was reported to have been seized by men in plainclothes on July 27, apparently to pressure her brother Mohammed, who was organising protests in Homs, according to Amnesty. The London-based group had also said al-Hosni's mother found her body in the morgue in September and, according to the family, she had been decapitated and her body badly mutilated. Syrian authorities blame the unrest in the country on armed gangs and extremists and accuses some Arab TV channels of broadcasting false news to ignite protests and stir anti-government emotions. State media allots much of its time and resources to discounting what it says are foreign media fabrications and lies. There are no independent or pro-opposition media outlets in Syria. The Syrian government has banned foreign journalists and placed heavy restrictions on local coverage, making it difficult to independently verify events on the ground.","TV appearance is a propaganda boost for Assad government .

David Cameron today rejected the idea of Britain becoming a second class member of the European Union, insisting he would not give up his place at the Brussels âtableâ. The Prime Minister gave his biggest hint yet that he will use his imminent speech on Europe to rebuff calls from many in the Tory party for a radical change in the UKâs membership of the EU. It comes as Virgin boss Sir Richard . Branson warned an exit from the EU 'would be very bad for British . business and the economy as a whole' and risked putting up 'the barriers . of isolation and protectionism'. David Cameron, who is due to give a major speech setting out his Europe policy this month, vowed not to give up Britain's place in setting EU rules . Mr Cameron explicitly rejected the idea of replicating the status of countries like Norway and Switzerland which have refused to join the EU, but are forced to sign up to many of its rules in order to access the single market. But he pledged voters would get a 'real choice' on Britain's relationship with the EU, including attempting to claw back powers. However, UKIP Leader Nigel Farage said the British people could not believe what Mr Cameron says. Mr Farage said: 'He sits there and thinks his great extended tease about this forthcoming Europe speech is entertaining, it is not. [No matter what he says now, after so many broken promises, so many ""cast-iron guarantees"", can anybody honestly believe that he will be telling the truth this time? The simple fact is that he wants us to stay in the European Union no matter how it is configured.' An influential group of European federalists, who want to see Brussels given even greater powers, is suggesting the UK be relegated to âassociate memberâ status. The move would see Britain remain part of the single market but freed from much of the social legislation and bureaucracy associated with full EU membership. Under the plan the UK's 73 MEPs in the European Parliament would be scrapped, along with its commissioner and power to veto new rules. Instead Britain would remain attached to the EUâs single market, but not have influence on how the European bloc develops. The idea has been hailed as âgreat newsâ but senior Euroceptic Tory MPs, who have urged Mr Cameron to set out a radical new European policy in his long-awaited speech this month. But critics warn it would see London âruled by faxâ from Brussels. UKIP Leader Nigel Farage said the British people could not believe what Mr Cameron says . Mr Cameron today again rejected the idea of leaving the EU altogether. âI think we are better in. You have to think of our national interest. Britain is a trading nation, we are one of the world's great trading nations, one of the world's great manufacturers, on our doorstep is this enormous single market, the biggest market in the world. âIt matters to us not just that our goods and services have access to these markets,' he told BBC Radio 5Live. âWe want to be round the table writing the rules of that market, which is why I don't think itâs right to aim for a status like Norway or Switzerland where basically you have to obey all the rules of the single market but you don't get to say what they are.â Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson warned Britain had to play an active role in Europe or become 'an island completely adrift in 20 years' The idea of 'associate membership' is . being pushed by the Union of European Federalists which views Britain as . a âcontinual impedimentâ to the dream of creating a united federal . Europe. Lib Dem MEP Andrew Duff, who heads the Union of European Federalists, said the proposal would create a new category of EU membership to stop Britain leaving altogether. âIf . David Cameron proposes a catalogue of opt-outs, derogations, red lines . and rebates for Britain to pick and choose, then he will strengthen the . argument for the creation of a formal association for the UK,â he said.. âThe priority on the Continent . is to create a federal system which works and Britain is seen at . present as a continual impediment. âThe federal movement in the spring is to draft a new treaty that will, I have no doubt, include associate membership.â The Union of European Federalists is expected to set out the plan in a draft EU treaty in the spring. Last . week Jacques Delors, the former European Commission president, . suggested Britain could leave the EU but remain as a âpartnerâ. 'If . the British do not follow the tendency towards more integration in the . European Union, we can anyway stay friends, but in another way,â he . said. However, business leaders have warned against leaving the EU. Writing on his blog, Virgin Group boss Sir Richard Branson said: 'An exit would be very bad for British business and the economy as a whole. 'The UK has always been a successful trading nation and has built relationships around the world to help its companies prosper. However, today global business relies on large trading agreements created by regions and not by countries. 'The EU is the UK's biggest trading partner.

Lying paralysed on the operating table, feeling every incision of the surgeon's knife but being unable to tell them ranks high among every hospital patient's worst fears. Today, a new study of operations done under general anaesthetic reveals that more than 150 people lived through this nightmare in just a year. And a third of them were awake throughout their operation, the audit for the Royal College of Anaesthetists (RCoA) and the Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland (AAGBI) revealed. Waking up during surgery is a common fear and happened to 153 people in 2011 . The study asked senior anaesthetists to give the number of cases of those who were awake when they should have been anaesthetised during surgery in 2011, and also to estimate how many such episodes of 'accidental awareness' they had witnessed in their careers. More than 7,000 anaesthetists responded (82 per cent of those asked), and were also asked about how they monitored their patients' awareness during and after operations. The survey showed that there were 153 reported cases of 'accidental awareness' in 2011, a third of whom (30 per cent) said they were awake for the duration of surgery. Not surprisingly, most of those (62 per cent) said they suffered 'pain or distress' at being awake during their operations. Almost half of the patients (47 per cent) said they were awake 'at or after the induction of anaesthesia', while a further quarter (23 per cent) reported awareness before they had fully recovered from the anaesthesia. Mother-of-two Sarah Newton, 32, from . Hinckley in Leicestershire, was one of those who experienced the . nightmare of waking up during an operation in 2011. Mother of two Sarah Newton, 32, woke up as her stomach was being sliced open during a four-hour operation at Coventry's University Hospital in April 2011 . Miss Newton was at Coventry's University Hospital to undergo surgery on her stomach and spine designed to relieve pressure on her brain. She says she remembers having a tube fitted into her hand and then 'going black', before becoming aware of the most excruciating pain. Miss Newton, who was later awarded Â£30,000 compensation for her traumatic experience, said: 'There are no words to describe what it felt like. 'I could feel them cutting across - it was them cutting my stomach open.Â  I was unsure whether I was dreaming. 'I could hear them talking but I couldn't move at all; I was trying to scream. 'I tried to wiggle my toes desperately hard but I couldn't move anything.Â  I tried to raise my heartbeat to make them notice but they couldn't notice.Â  I couldn't blink or anything. 'The feeling of being trapped was worse than the pain.Â  I have never experienced pure panic like it ever before. 'I really believed I was going to die.Â  It felt as if I was being tortured but was powerless to stop it.' Miss Newton then remembered that when the surgeon had explained the operation to her before surgery, he had said her stomach would be cut last, so she realised she was nearing the end of the op. To distract herself, she counted every stitch and every staple that went into her stomach. She said: 'I could feel every stitch going in - I counted all the stitches.Â  It's infinite counting now in my nightmares.Â  And then the staples afterwards: I was able to tell them exactly how many they had done.' Miss Newton, remembers 40 minutes of her operation, screamed uncontrollably in recovery, and a nurse ran to get the anaesthetist. 'The first thing I said was ""I was awake""', she said.Â  'He was mortified: straightaway he knew.Â  He kept saying: ""I'm sorry, I shouldn't have done it.""' Her consultant anaesthetist had decided that day to change his usual routine, switching off the anaesthetic towards the end of the operation so that the patient would become alert faster afterwards. He kept his job but the hospital did not contest Miss Newton's account.Â  She went on to suffer post-traumatic stress disorder which meant she was unable to leave the house for six months, and now will not have further operations because she is not emotionally strong enough. While the new study's figure of 153 cases may sound alarmingly high, the scientists who conducted the survey said previous research had shown the number of people waking up during operations was actually far higher. Several studies have shown that one or two patients per 1,000 is actually awake during their op - a far cry from today's study which gives a figure of one in every 15,000 general anaesthetics. Professor Tim Cook, co-author of the study and a consultant anaesthetist in Bath said: 'Most of the cases involved the patient being aware during induction when they are being sent off to sleep or after the operation itself has finished. 'They might feel some awareness of tugging or hear some noises.' He added: 'You want to make sure that they are under but you don't want to give them too much because that is dangerous in itself. 'Risks to patients undergoing general anaesthesia are very small, and have decreased considerably in the last decades. 'Anaesthesia doctors in the UK undergo the same level of training as surgeons and physicians. Of the 3m general anaesthetics administered in the NHS each year, only a very small number of patients experience awareness during anaesthesia, with the majority of these occurring before surgery starts or after it finishes.'","Survey looked at 3m general anaesthetics done in UK and Ireland in 2011 .

A 32-year-old man has been adopted by his former foster mother after being reunited with her following a decade-long separation. Maurice Griffin was removed from his foster family at the age of 13, but never found a permanent home and longed to return to them. And today the burly adult will officially be adopted by Lisa Godbold, who took him into her California home in the 1980s. Scroll down for video . Reunited: Maurice Griffin with Lisa Godbold, who fostered him when he was a young boy . Contrast: Mr Griffin has grown from a fresh-faced youngster to a burly 32-year-old man . Mr Griffin was a young child when he was spotted by Ms Godbold and her husband Charles at an orphanage, according to CNN. They agreed to foster him at their home near Sacramento - partly because they were an interracial couple and the boy was mixed race. 'Interracial relationships weren't as common or accepted as they are today, and the fact that Maurice was biracial and we were a biracial family made us a great ""profile"",' Ms Godbold said. The youngster also got on well with his younger foster brothers, Gideon and Spencer, whom he described as his 'best friends'. Family: Maurice was considered a good fit with Ms Godbold's interracial family as he was mixed race . 'Best friends': Maurice quickly bonded with his younger foster siblings but was forced to leave the home . Harmonious: But Ms Godbold's husband Charles died in 1998, and she later remarried . The family was planning to adopt their newest addition, but when he was 13 child welfare authorities intervened. Maurice was removed from his foster parents when officials discovered that they had been spanking him when he misbehaved, as they did with their other sons. 'We wanted him to feel like the rest of our kids,' Ms Gobold said. 'And there was a difference of opinion with some of the supervisors.' Although the couple fought fiercely to keep the boy, they were forced to give up when they were threatened with losing their biological children too. Maurice spent the rest of his childhood moving from one foster home to another, and says he never found the same connection with a family again. 'I couldn't talk to anybody about it because nobody was there,' he told CNN. 'I couldn't call somebody - there was just a void in me.' Together again: The pair found each other via MySpace and will now make their family relationship legal . Emotional: When they first talked on the telephone Mr Griffin was overcome by the strength of feeling . With the rise of social networking, Mr Griffin saw the opportunity to re-connect with his would-be relatives. However, Ms Godbold's husband had died in 1998, and she had subsequently changed her name after remarrying, which complicated the search. In 2007, the foster mother and son made contact via MySpace - and then Ms Godbold decided to phone Mr Griffin. 'She said, ""Hey baby"" - and I said, ""I got to call you back,""' he said as he recalled how he was overcome with emotion. They have now decided to 'make it official', and on Friday they are heading to a courtroom to apply for Mr Griffin to be adopted by Ms Godbold. 'It has to happen,' he told CNN.

Ion Balint, known as 'Nutzu the Pawnbroke', kept four lions and two bears for a decade at his heavily guarded home, which is alleged to have included a torture chamber. Balint, 48, has been indicted for heading a gang controlling the underworld in the Romanian capital, and had his animals impounded by authorities today. Scroll down for video .

Balint kept the lions and bears, as well as thoroughbred horses and canaries, at his high-walled and heavily guarded estate in the poorest part of Bucharest. There has been rumours of the estate being fitted with a torture chamber and Balint using the animals to strike fear in his opponents, claims which has been rubbished by his family. âMany untruths are being reported,â Balint's son-in-law Marius said.

Roar-manian style: Local press has reported Mr Balint used the animals to keep his enemies in check . Earlier today, the lions and bears were sedated, put in cages and taken to a zoo by environmental authorities and animal welfare officers. The animals, which generally appeared in good condition, may be eventually relocated in South Africa, animal welfare officers said. Bystanders and relatives who gathered near the gates of the estate described Balint as a good neighbour and an animal lover, and said they were not bothered by roaring lions. âWe can hear them every day but only when they're hungry or the female is in heat,â said Gabriela Ionescu, 36, robed in a dressing gown and clutching her toddler daughter's hand. âThey don't disturb us at all.â Animal attraction: Local press gathered to photograph the animals as they were removed from the heavily guarded property today . Roaring trade: Career criminal Balint is said to have kept the animals illegally for more than a decade . Baliunt is has no documentation or health records for the animals, which he has kept illegally for 10 years, Mircea Pupaza, commissioner of the National Environment Guard said. He could face a year in prison and a hefty fine for illegally keeping wild animals. âThe lions are a status symbol for him,â welfare authority spokesman Livia Cimpoeru said, declining to speculate whether they were used for threats or torture. Authorities allege that Balint and his brother Vasile headed a criminal network which controlled much of the underworld activity in Bucharest. Some 400 police and detectives were involved in the investigation which led to the arrest last week of 67 suspects, including the Balint brothers.

A desperate family is appealing for help raising the Â£200,000 needed to allow their son to have last-chance cancer treatment in the U.S. Sam John, 16, was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumour when he was just nine-years-old. However, tests earlier this month revealed that the tumour has now started to grow, meaning his only chance is specialist radiation treatment only available in the U.S. The treatment is not yet available in . the UK so the family, from Fareham, Hants, is waiting to find out . whether the NHS will pay for Sam to be treated abroad. Sam (right) is pictured with his brother Matthew, 13, (left) and parents, Steve and Vicki. Steve John has pledged to dedicate his life to charity if Sam's fundraising appeal is successful . Sam (pictured in 2006) has been battling the cancer since he was nine . If their application is refused, they will have to find between Â£100,000 and Â£200,000 to pay for the proton beam therapy themselves. Samâs father has pledged to dedicate the rest of his life to helping other children in similar positions if his appeal is successful. Writing on his sonâs Facebook fundraising page, Steve John, said: âThe time for personal pride and ego has passed. I am hoping that by reaching out to you all, you might be able to support us in trying to offer Sam a future thatâs as normal as possible. âSam is going to get the best treatment there is to give him a future. That is not in question. How we make it happen is the challenge. âWeâre currently all still reeling from the scale of the news weâve received but we donât have the luxury of time to waste. We have to act now. âIf this appeal works, Iâm prepared to dedicate the rest of my life to helping other children in similar positions. âWe have to make this work for Sam and we've got just over two months to find the money.â Until his diagnosis seven years ago, Sam was a perfectly healthy nine-year-old. Sam (pictured on his 11th birthday in January 2008) is to sit his GCSEs this summer . However, his family was then given the devastating news that he had a brain tumour. The tumour itself is one of the less dangerous types that can often be treated very successfully with surgery. However, Sam was unlucky. His tumour is in one of the worst possible places - on his midbrain at the top of his brain stem - making even partial removal impossible without catastrophic consequences. Mr John,Â  44, explained that during the past seven years, Sam has been fighting his condition daily, enduring many surgical procedures, infections, countless blood transfusions and even post-operative meningitis as well as the permanent effects of the tumour. He explains that his son also endured a two year course of chemotherapy which successfully slowed the progression of the tumour. Mr John wrote: âThere are some lasting side effects of his condition and from the cruel chemotherapy regime, but due to his personal strength, Sam brushes those aside and battles on with his life, thriving in school and making the most of every day. âSam has a close circle of friends who are very supportive, helping him live a full and varied life. He studies hard and is looking forward to successful GCSE results this summer. âHe's doing really well and is on course for getting As and Bs.â Sam's best chance of a normal future is proton beam therapy in the U.S. He is pictured here (left) with his mother, Vicki, and his brother, Matthew . However, recent scans have shown that the tumour has become more active and that there are large cysts developing around it. Samâs doctors have recommended that he has radiation treatment but the family are torn as there are potentially severe side effects. The treatment has a good chance of being able to render Samâs tumour dormant and may result in no further treatment for that tumour â ever. However, because of where Samâs tumour is, radiation treatment is very dangerous. Healthy parts of his brain would be exposed harmful radiation. Mr John explained that this could affect everything from his vision to his hearing, motor function and memory. On top of this, the tumour is near Samâs pituitary gland and if this is damaged he could suffer problems with growth, thyroid function, metabolism, sex hormones and blood pressure. However, in the U.S. a more advanced treatment â known as proton beam therapy â is available. It allows the radiation to be targeted directly at the tumour meaning that healthy surrounding tissue is not damaged. Samâs family believe that this is the best option for him. For more information on how to donate visit the fundraising page - http://st7870.wix.com/thinkingshrinking# . Proton beam therapy is a type of radiotherapy.It uses a high energy beam of protons rather than X-rays to deliver a dose of radiotherapy for cancer patients.It is particularly effective for treating tumours at the base of the skull or in the spine.It directs all of the radiation directly to the tumour meaning there is minimal damage caused to surrounding healthy tissue.This means that it usually causes a lot fewer side effects than are associated with other forms of radiotherapy.Proton beam therapy is not currently available in the UK but the NHS will send some patients overseas for treatment.The treatment will be available in the UK from 2017.","Sam John, 16, was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumour aged nine .

It was unclear how the girl escaped or when her mother was killed, authorities said. Police . are still piecing together the timeline of the crime, but their best . guess is that after assaulting the girl, Renz drove down a nearby rural . road. Thatâs where they think the woman, 47, who worked at an elementary school, was stabbed to death. The . girl managed to escape the scene and run down the road and was aided by . a passing driver. The child's name has not been released. The girl sustained injuries from the attack and currently being treated at a hospital. Her mother died from multiple stab wounds. Suspect: New York State Police lead David Renz out of the North Syracuse state police barracks Friday, March 15, 2013. Renz, 29, abducted a school librarian and her daughter as they left a gymnastics class . Photos of Renz, too, are being withheld for fear they could âpollute the investigation,' New York State Police Captain Mark Lincoln said in a Friday morning press conference. âItâll be released down the road,â Captain Lincoln said. Police seem sure, however, that the suspect did not know the victims personally. Renz fled the scene on foot, into nearby woods, where he was apprehended by police without a struggle. The suspect was arraigned Friday on . murder, rape and kidnapping charges and was held without bail. The . lawyer assigned to his case, Ken Moynihan, didn't return a call seeking . comment. Renz appeared a his arraignment with a swollen face and a broken nose after being assaulted by inmates at the Onondaga County Justice Center, CNY Central reported. Following his court appearance, the 29-year-old suspect was returned to jail, but placed into protective custody. Renz is also being guarded for now, but he will not be transfered to a different facility. The 29-year-old had been charged in . January with possession of child pornography and allowed to remain free . under terms that included staying off the Internet and away from places . including schools, parks and arcades. He lost his job at a supermarket, . moved in with his mother and hadn't been able to find other work after . his arrest, according to court documents. According . to an FBI criminal complaint, agents who went to the North Syracuse . apartment where Renz was living in June found in his bedroom four . computers that he told them he used to view adult pornography. Agent . Alix Skelton said Renz eventually admitted using the Internet for the . past six years to download child porn to a drive on one of the machines, . which he turned over to the agents. Technicians determined in November . that it had an encrypted hard drive, and Skelton said Renz provided the . encryption key. Agents . reviewing the drive in December found about 100 gigabytes of child porn . comprising more than 500 videos and more than 3,000 images, according to . the complaint. Among the . images were two showing sex acts involving prepubescent girls, said . Skelton, a member of a unit that targets people involved in online . exploitation of children. Crime scene: New York State Police investigate a car involved in a fatal carjacking on Verplank Road, Clay, N.Y . Renz was charged on Jan. 9 in federal court with possession of child pornography. On Jan. 29, a judge granted a prosecutor's request for an extension of the time required for grand jury action so investigators could continue going over ""numerous items of electric media"" for additional evidence. Renz, who authorities said had no prior police record, was released after agreeing to stay at home at night with an electronic monitor and away from any place he might encounter children. But Renz removed the monitor, Executive Assistant U.S. Attorney John Duncan said. Federal probation officials were investigating what happened, including whether Renz was able to get around an alert that is supposed to go off if the ankle bracelet is removed, he said. Late Friday afternoon, state police turned Renz over to federal authorities, who will hold him for violating the terms of his release, court documents said. Duncan said the cases against him will continue in federal and state courts. In an interview with Syracuse.com Friday, a former manager and trainer of David Renz described him as a courteous and intelligent employee who had worked at the James Street Wegmans since his teens. The manager recalled tha the 29-year-old was always willing to help customers and was 'trusted' by his superiors.","The girl was able to flee the scene and get help from a passing driver and is now being treated for injuries .

Australian soldiers serving in Afghanistan have been criticised for sunbathing and playing golf while on the front line. A senior commander said troops wanted to be treated like 'Roman gladiators' and did not seem to be taking their duties seriously in a stinging attack on the country's military culture. Tensions in Afghanistan have been rising as an American general warned Western soldiers to expect more insider attacks and a photograph was circulated showing six dead Taliban militants. WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGES . Attack: The bodies of six Taliban militants killed by police in Helmand province this week . Ambush: Western troops have been warned to expect an upsurge in insider attacks in the near future . Lt Col Chris Smith, a leading figure in the Australian army, said many soldiers' perceptions of war were based on misleading imagery found in computer games. His report on discipline among the troops recorded 'examples throughout Australia's commitment in Afghanistan of soldiers sunbathing in tactical positions, sitting in chairs and facing inwards in enemy areas, listening to music in tactical positions'. He added that soldiers had been seen playing football and exercising in key areas on the front line between the Taliban and NATO troops, and hitting golf balls into enemy territory. Australian troops were also criticised for 'greeting helicopters at landing zones in thongs [ie flip-flops] and T-shirts'. The damning report was published by the head of the army this week so it could serve as a warning to soldiers that they needed to improve their behaviour. Haul: Police in Jowzjan province with a cache of weapons captured from Taliban fighters . Success: But tensions are rising as the warm weather has hastened the start of the fighting season . In other developments, officials in the southern Helmand province released a grisly image of six Taliban fighters apparently killed by police after attempting to ambush a patrol. It is believed that the gunfight also involved troops from the NATO coalition, and local tribal leaders claimed that the militants were shot at from helicopters. Despite efforts to wind down Western involvement in the wartorn country, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan yesterday warned that attacks on his troops were set to get worse. General Joseph Dunford predicted that recent anti-American comments by president Hamid Karzai would inflame tensions. 'We're at a rough point in the relationship,' he wrote in an email to other U.S. officials. Mr Dunford also said unusually warm weather could mean an early start to the Taliban fighting season because militants can return from high mountain passes from Pakistan. Inflammatory: President Hamid Karzai has stepped up his anti-American rhetoric in recent weeks . Mr Karzai defended his controversial remarks, saying: 'My recent comments were meant to help reform, not destroy the relationship. 'We want good relations and friendship with America, but the relationship must be between two independent nations.' Over the weekend, the Afghan leader accused the U.S. of conspiring with the Taliban on suicide attacks to keep the country unstable and give foreign forces an excuse to stay beyond 2014. His remarks followed two attacks that killed at least 19 Afghans on Saturday, coinciding with the first official visit by U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel. Karzai also cautioned this week that the delay in handing over a U.S.-run detention center to Afghan control 'could harm bilateral relations'.","Senior Australian commander says troops want to be 'Roman gladiators'

He is clearly keen to find a way to spice up his stodgy public image. But having a âGeri Halliwell momentâ was perhaps not what Ed Miliband had in mind. The Labour leader was photographed yesterday taking the London Underground, just as former Spice Girl Miss Halliwell had been the day before. Mr Miliband â fresh from being labelled a champagne socialist during Prime Ministerâs Questions 24 hours earlier â was on the Tube with Labour MP Dame Tessa Jowell. Smiles: Miliband shared a joke with a passenger and Dame Tessa Jowell, left, during the journey on the Tube . Spooked: Labour leader Ed Miliband looks uncomfortable as he takes the tube back to Westminster after delivering a speech on banking . The pair were returning to . Westminster following a meeting with business owners in Brixton, south . London, where they were joined by Labourâs business spokesman Chuka . Umunna. Mr Miliband . and Dame Tessa were seen laughing and joking with commuters who appeared . pleased, if a little surprised, to see him in their midst. Slumming it: Geri Halliwell took the Tube yesterday and expressed her excitement on Twitter . The . Labour leader did his best to look nonchalant â and at least he stayed . awake, unlike his elder brother David, who was caught out by fellow . passengers in January when he fell asleep on the Tube with his flies . open. But Tube photo-opportunities are not without their peril, as Miss Halliwell found. She . faced a Twitter backlash after she stunned commuters by tweeting her . top tips for taking the underground â following her first Tube trip in . 17 years, a journey that lasted all of one stop. Earlier he used a speech to business leaders to set out a plan for a . new network of lenders which would only funnel money to people and . businesses in their area. He said up to 20 new regional banks would be . created by a Labour government to herald a return to old-fashioned local . lending. He attacked high street banking giants who too often say 'no' to customers, and promised new 'banks you can come to trust'. But banking groups said they had already increased the number of local bank managers taking decisions on lending to business. Lending to small firms has collapsed in . recent months, leading critics to accuse the big taxpayer funded banks . of âstabbing businesses in the backâ. Bank . of England figures last month revealed net lending - the amount banks . lend compared to money repaid by customers - was negative at minus . Â£1.5billion. Smart casual: Mr Miliband tries to look relaxed but risks the doors banging him on the head . Chewing things over: Mr Miliband was joined by shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna and local MP Tessa Jowell to meet diners in Brixton Village in south London today . This is despite the launch of an Â£80billion scheme by the Bank and the Treasury last August aimed specifically at solving the countryâs small business and mortgage lending crisis. The Daily Mailâs âMake the Banks Lendâ campaign was launched in July 2010 to highlight the problems facing small businesses. Labour say the regional banks would leverage private sector funding but may also require an injection of public money. They are provisionally called âSparksâ - as they are modelled on regional banks in Germany called sparkassen. Awkward: Mr Miliband did not look comfortable as he left a cafe in Brixton . Hats off: The Labour leader toured shops and met market stall holders to discuss his plans for new local banks . Mr Miliband told to the British Chambers of Commerce: âThe regional banks being proposed will be committed to their regions and in touch with local business, making it easier for firms to secure the capital investment they need so they can create the jobs and growth Britain needs.â He said he had heard from countless businesses refused legitimate finance by 'banks that don't know your businesses or who don't seem to care'. 'Nothing the government has done has made a difference. Net lending fell by Â£4.5 billion in the last quarter while the big banks carry on with a bonus as usual culture. 'It is time to recognise that tinkering will not sort this out. Britain needs a wholly new banking system.' However, today Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg accused Labour of letting the banks 'get away with blue murder' before the 2008 financial crash. He told LBC 97.3: 'It was Liberal Democrats who week in, week out said to Gordon Brown and Ed Balls âDonât go off on your prawn cocktail charm offensive in the City of London.â 'Which was what Ed Balls was doing at the time; basically sucking up to the banks and letting them get away with all that nonsense. 'They left the cupboard bare, they let the banks run amuck and I find it quite remarkable how little contrition we hear from Ed Balls and Ed Miliband, they still havenât acknowledged their responsibility in creating the mess in the first place.'. Mr Miliband said next week's Budget had to focus on helping firms to succeed . Labour already had plans to create a British Investment Bank, but Mr Miliband said he would go further. 'We don't just need a single Investment Bank serving the country. We need a regional banking system, serving each and every region of the country. 'Regional banks with a mission to serve that region and that region alone. Not banks that like to say 'no', but banks that know your region and your business. Not banks that you mistrust, but banks you can come to trust. 'I am committed to turning that idea . into reality during the next government because I am determined that One . Nation Labour becomes the party of the small business and the . entrepreneur as together we create a recovery made by the many and built . to last.' Lord Oakeshott, a . Lib Dem peer who resigned in 2011 after criticising Project Merlin - a . previous Government attempt to help small firms - gave the scheme a . cautious welcome. Mr Miliband wants to see a return to 'old fashioned' bank managers, like Captain Mainwaring in BBC TV's Dad's Army . He said yesterday: âAll ideas to make banks lend are welcome and this is a sensible idea to increase long term lending. âBut it will take a long time to build a network of regional banks and the key challenge in the short-term is how to make the state-owned banks RBS and Lloyds lend as they represent 60 per cent of the market and they are failing the nation. That is now the biggest challenge facing the Government.â The Federation of Small Business said regional banks had been proposed before and they had to examine the details to see if they could work in Britain. Mr Miliband said small and medium sized firms âare the backbone of the British economyâ but keep being turned down for lending. The new banks would be regional partners in a British Investment Bank which is already underway. He will also outline the need for infrastructure projects such as a airports and railways. Addressing next week's Budget, Mr . Miliband added: 'You've been telling us for so long that the way we . resource and plan our infrastructure in Britain is not good enough. We must tackle this. 'That's why, when our construction sector is still flat on its back, One . Nation Labour would be advancing investment in infrastructure.' He aid the Budget needed to 'raise our sights to the big challenges that our country has faced for decades'. 'To succeed, we don't just need immediate measures: we need to build new . institutions out of the rubble of the old with radical new approaches . to banking, skills, the British firm and infrastructure, underpinned by . confidence and clarity about our place in the world.'","Milliband took to the Tube to meet ordinary people .

"By . Emma Innes . PUBLISHED: . 10:34 EST, 5 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:10 EST, 5 March 2013 . A Pointer called Major has been identified by historians as the first 'pedigree' dog. The team, from the University of Manchester, found a description of the dog in an 1865 edition of the Victorian journal, The Field. It is believed that this was the first time that an attempt had been made to define a dog breed standard based on the animalâs physical form. John Henry Walsh, who wrote under the pseudonym 'Stonehenge', paved the way for the pedigree dog breeds we know today with his description of Major (pictured) John Henry Walsh, who wrote under the . pseudonym âStonehengeâ, paved the way for the pedigree dog breeds we . know today by creating a system of giving scores for different parts of . the dogâs body. His aim was to solve the bitter disputes that were brewing over the seemingly arbitrary decisions of judges at dog shows which could see a dog win a class one week and then come last the next. In September 1865, Stonehenge published a classification for the Pointer which gave its head and neck 30 points, frame and general symmetry 25, legs and feet 20, quality and stern 15, and colour and coat 10. The historians who discovered Major are based at the Centre for the History of Science, Technology and Medicine and the School of Arts, Languages and Cultures â both at the University of Manchester. Professor Michael Worboys, who was involved in the research, said: âThe standard set by Major must surely be one of the most important milestones in the 6,000-year-old relationship between canines and man. The pointer - experts say it may have been the first 'modern' dog breed defined by its physical form . âAs dogs came to be defined as 'breeds', they were bred for greater conformity to breed standards, which meant more inbreeding, and more health problems as dogs were bred from a smaller gene pool. âStonehengeâs classifications set in chain a process where dogs were re-imagined, redesigned and remade.â Stonehenge's aim was to solve the bitter disputes that were brewing over the seemingly arbitrary decisions of judges at dog shows (Major is pictured) Dr Julie-Marie Strange added: âStonehenge was so impressed by Major when he saw drawings of the dog â and heard it had won a prize at a Birmingham show â he devised the classification. âThereâs a historical theme in the way many of these breeds were created. For example, though bull baiting had been banned in 1830, the Bulldog was bred to form considered to be ideal for grappling with a bull, for example, a protruding lower jaw to grab the soft nose of bull.â Before the 1860s, types of dogs were defined by what they did, not how they looked. Pointers were gun dogs, valued and bred for their ability to find game and, though a recognisable type, came in a variety of sizes and colours. But in the show ring they were expected to have a defined shape that aspired to the ideal set out in the breed standard. Major signalled a new age where dogs were increasingly bred for their form and from their pedigree. The emphasis on conformation to breed types spread rapidly to other countries, where British dog shows were emulated and British dogs imported as foundational breed stock. Dr Neil Pemberton said: âThough Stonehengeâs classification isnât used today, its principle of defining a breed and judging by conformation will be the main criterion in the show ring at Cruftâs this week.â","Major was described by John Henry Walsh in an 1865 edition of The Field .

High hopes: Sergeant Slater is one of six injured British soldiers hoping to take part in The Walking With The Wounded South Pole Allied Challenge Expedition . Tough: They are currently training in Iceland where temperatures drop to minus 20C and winds reach 50mph . Sergeant Slater was told by doctors he would never walk again after his vehicle was blown up by a Taliban roadside bomb when he was serving with the RAF Regiment. But the 34-year-old has now learned to ski and is aiming to become a record-breaker by being the first double amputee to ski to the South Pole. 'I volunteered to do this to show what amputees can do,"" he said after spending five days and nights on Langjokull glacier in Iceland. 'It would be great to see more and more amputees reach the pole.

Sergeant Slater has been in Iceland with other wounded men and women from the UK, US, Australia and Canada to familiarise himself with the conditions the teams will face in Antarctica. They have camped out on the glacial ice, melted snow for water each morning and night and eaten freeze-dried rations. Sgt Slater said the conditions have been a strain, but he has learned to adapt. 'It's had its challenges to be honest,' he said. 'It's not easy learning to ski and then go out for four days covering quite a lot of mileage. But it's been a great learning curve.' Asked if he has a particular technique, he added: 'It is a little bit ad hoc, but you've got to find your way of doing it and find a rhythm, but once you do that, it's amazing how much distance you can cover in a day. Heavy luggage: The wounded servicemen and women from the UK, US, Australia and Canada trekked for more than 15 miles each day dragging sledges, known as pulks, weighing 130lb . Varied: Each team has members with injuries ranging from post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to total blindness and gunshot wounds . 'You've got to be quite hot on your personal administration.

Each team has members with injuries ranging from double leg amputations to post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and total blindness to gunshot wounds. No easy feat: The challenge involves a 200-mile walk across the southern wilderness . Team work: Some of the soldiers who have been training in Iceland for the last week . They will face huge challenges on the 200-mile walk in the southern wilderness, which is extremely hazardous even for people without profound physical and mental injury. The Walking With The Wounded charity successfully reached the North Pole in 2011 in an expedition which Prince Harry joined for five days, and last year an attempt to reach the summit of Mount Everest was called off because conditions on the mountain were too dangerous.

A self-styled 'superhero' has hung up his cape after just two years of fighting crime - because he has been beaten up by yobs. Roger Hayhurst, 20, was attacked by a gang of thugs and left with a badly swollen face after they recognised him as the 'Knight Warrior' whilst he was out walking with his fiancee. The assault has now prompted gardener Roger to give up his night job breaking up fights and tackling anti-social behaviour in Salford, Greater Manchester whilst dressed in a custom-made Â£200 blue-and-black lycra costume. Hanging up the cape: Roger Hayhurst once patrolled the streets of Salford breaking up fights and tackling anti-social behaviour but has hung up his cape after being attacked by yobs . During his crime fighting career Roger also handed out clothing and food parcels to the homeless in Manchester city centre. He became a hit with locals, said he would run for Salford mayor and got himself a slot as a presenter on a local radio station. Attacked: Roger was left with a badly swollen face after yobs recognised him as the 'Knight Warrior' whilst he was out walking with his fiancee Rebecca . He also got girlfriend, 18-year old Rebecca Wall, who was subsequently nicknamed Knight Maiden after she heard about his exploits. Today Roger, who now hosts a crime fighting show on Salford City Radio, said: 'We were recognised when we were walking through Salford and some lads started punching me. My face was all swollen. Loved up: Rebecca Wall fell in love with Roger after reading about his Super Hero lifestyle as the Knight Warrior in a magazine and they are now engaged . 'After that I still dress up and occasionally patrol, but now I mainly dress up for charity appearances. Rebecca has got rid of her costume now.'

Supporting her boyfriend: Rebecca, who earned herself the nickname Knight Maiden has also hung up her cape after what happened . He said: 'I just wanted to do good in the world, that's all. When people saw me coming up it did tend to stun them into silence. 'I just carried on trying to get them to calm down, and eventually most of them did.

Labour attempts to split the coalition are in tatters tonight after the government agreed on an unprecedented fudge to spare the Liberal Democratsâ blushes. Ministers spent the day thrashing out a way to prevent Nick Cleggâs party from having to vote against his treasured Mansion Tax policy in a Commons vote being held by Labour tomorrow. Instead the Tories and Lib Dems will back an unprecedented amendment which admits David Cameron and Mr Clegg are at loggerheads over the proposal to impose a levy on homes worth more than Â£2million. Coalition split: David Cameron, pictured today leaving Downing Street, is opposed to an 'intrusive' Mansion Tax but Nick Clegg (right) wants the levy on homes worth more than Â£2million . This morning Lib Dem Business . Secretary Vince Cable hinted he would back Labourâs motion which called . for âa mansion tax on properties worth over Â£2million, to fund a tax cut . for millions of people on middle and low incomesâ. But he backtracked tonight, insisting he could now support the government line. The coalition amendment, agreed just . hours before the deadline set by Commons officials, states that the . government has cut taxes for low and middle earners while âat the same . time increasing taxes on the wealthy, including raising stamp duty on . expensive properties and restricting tax reliefsâ. But in a highly unusual move, it goes on . to admit that the governing parties cannot agree on targeting . properties owned by the super-rich. It ânotes that both parts of the . Coalition continue to support tax cuts for people on low and middle . incomes... [and it] notes the part of the Coalition led by the Deputy . Prime Minister also advocates a Mansion Tax on properties worth more . than Â£2million, as set out in his partyâs manifesto, and the part of the . Coalition led by the Prime Minister does not advocate a Mansion Taxâ. A senior Lib Dem source said the . compromise was an 'ingenious solution' because neither coalition party . wanted to publicly back Labour in a Commons vote. The Lib Dems want to target high value properties, like these flats in Knightsbridge, but have been rebuffed by the Tories . Mr Cable said tonight that the Lib . Dems had refused to support a Labour motion 'designed exclusively to play . cynical party political games'. He added: âParties should be judged on . what they deliver on fairer taxes, rather than what they say about . them. In Government, Labour refused to back our mansion tax. âIn Government, Labour rubbished the . Liberal Democrat policy of a mansion tax. In Opposition, they have . simply copied it exactly in an attempt to fill in their blank piece of . paper where original policies should be.â But the move attracted ridicule from Labour. Party politics: Labour leader Ed Miliband (right) and shadow chancellor Ed Balls are seeking to exploit coalition tensions with tomorrow's vote . Shadow treasury minister Chris Leslie . said: âIt would be astonishing if the Liberal Democrats failed to back a . straightforward motion supporting their long-held policy of a mansion . tax on properties over Â£2 million. âThe Liberal Democrats have a simple . choice â either they back the policy they set out in their manifesto and . which Nick Clegg made the centrepiece of the Eastleigh by-election . campaign or they donât. No amount of wriggling or contortion can get . them out of that simple choice.â The Tories have remained implacably opposed to the idea of an extra annual tax on homes worth more than Â£2million. Downing Street today said David . Cameron and George Osborne believe the levy would âbe intrusive, . expensive to levy, raise little and the temptation for future . Chancellors to bring ever more homes into its net would be . irresistibleâ. Business Secretary Vince Cable drew up the Lib Dem policy on a mansion tax and said tonight the Lib Dems had refused to support a Labour motion 'designed exclusively to play cynical party political games' The Labour motion has been lifted from Lib Dem policy, piling pressure on Mr Cleggâs 57 MPs to side with Mr Miliband. The Lib Dems want to target high value properties but have been rebuffed by the Tories. The mansion tax was a Lib Dem . manifesto commitment at the last election and is being advocated by Mr . Clegg and Mr Cable in the current Budget negotiations. It would involve an annual one per . cent levy on homes worth more than Â£2 million. Owners would pay the tax . on the value of their home above Â£2 million. Someone living in a Â£3 . million property would pay Â£10,000 a year. But Downing Street warned Lib Dem ministers they could not vote for the Labour motion. Mr Cameronâs official spokesman said: . âThe Prime Minister will expect, as always, Government ministers to . support the Government in all votes.â He added: âThe Prime Minister's view . (on a mansion tax) is the same as the Chancellor's, which he set out at . the end of last year. âThe Chancellor said then that it was . intrusive, expensive to levy and raises little and that the temptation . for future chancellors to bring ever more homes into its net would be . irresistible.â Asked if Mr Cameron had discussed the . vote with Mr Clegg, he said: âThey talk about a wide number of things. I'm sure they also discussed this, yes.â Only this morning, Mr Cable, who drew up the Lib Dem policy on a mansion tax, hinted he was minded to vote with Labour. He said he had not seen the wording of . the motion â which was published on Friday â but he would examine it . before deciding how to vote. âWeâll certainly have a look at it,â he told BBC Radio 4. âWe did come to this five years go and we did set . out the logic behind it and how it would practically operate and Labour . had an opportunity in government to do it, didnât do it, weâre now three . years into the next Parliament, theyâve finally alighted on it, and if . it is a real commitment, I would certainly welcome that.â","Labour try to engender Coalition split by forcing Commons vote on imposing a levy on high value homes .

A respected Republican senator announced Thursday he is reversing his stance against gay marriage after his 21-year-old son came out to him and his wife. Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican considered as a running mate by the Romney campaign, said the discovery that his son Will, 21, was gay had given him a 'new perspective' and understanding of why equal opportunities matter. Will, a junior at Yale University, came out to his politician father and mother, Jane, two years ago, The Plain Dealer reports. Supportive: Rob Portman, center with his wife, Jane. Has reversed his position on gay marriage after his son Will, 21, center came out. The family including brother Jed, 22, far left, and sister, Sally, 18, are all supportive of the Yale student . Portman, who backed the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, says since his son's announcement he has been reconsidering his views on homosexuality and same-sex marriage. He said he had spent some time speaking to his church in Cincinnati and former Vice President Dick Cheney, whose daughter is gay. Today he wanted to officially and publicly reverse his political position on the issue. 'It allowed me to think of this issue from a new perspective, and that's of a Dad who loves his son a lot and wants him to have the same opportunities that his brother and sister would have -- to have a relationship like Jane and I have had for over 26 years,' Portman told the local paper. 'The overriding message of love and compassion that I take from the Bible, and certainly the Golden Rule, and the fact that I believe we are all created by our maker, that has all influenced me in terms of my change on this issue.' He added that he believed opening marriage up to homosexual couples 'strengthens the institution' and he realized his son's sexuality 'wasn't a choice'. He said his son had not exerted any influence on him politically but supported his new position and 'encouraged' him. Surprise move: Ohio senator Rob Portman, pictured, has previously opposed gay marriage but said his son's experience had given him a 'new perspective' Though surprised by his son's announcement, the senator said he and his wife were '100 percent supportive' of their middle son who has an older brother Jed, 22, and younger sister Sally, 18. 'Heâs an amazing young man,' he added. He said he had told the Romney campaign about his son when he was being considered by the campaign as a possible Vice-President candidate. He said Cheney, whose daughter Mary got married to her long-term partner in Washington D.C. last year, had encouraged him to 'follow his heart'. The announcement wasn't the beginning of a career as a gay marriage campaigner though, he said. Campaign: The announcement will give gay marriage supporters a boost . State decision: The senator now opposes the Defense of Marriage Act, a federal declaration that marriage was between a man and woman. He wants states to individually decide on the issue of same-sex marriage . He said he didn't want to push his personal views on others and still believes religious institutions should not be compelled to perform marriage ceremonies for same-sex couples. But he did say he is now opposed to the Defense of Marriage Act and supports states deciding on gay marriage. He said he had not considered how the position would affect him politically. He is conservative on social issues but specializes in economics which he focused on during his 2010 election campaign. He has previously also voted against allowing gay couples to adopt children, according to The Columbus Dispatch.","Ohio Republican senator Rob Portman announced he had changed his position on gay marriage today .

A former chief nurse at scandal-hit Stafford Hospital was a 'bully' who intimidated staff and 'wholly failed' in her management responsibilities, a disciplinary hearing has today been told. Janice Harry acted in an 'aggressive and intimidating' way and shouted at staff who raised problems with her, reducing some to tears, the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) heard. Harry denies a series of charges dating between 1998 and 2006 and related to alleged failures to ensure adequate nursing staffing levels and appropriate standards of record keeping, hygiene and cleanliness, administration of medication, provision of nutrition and fluids and patient dignity. Janice Harry acted in an 'aggressive and intimidating' way and shouted at staff who raised problems with her, reducing some to tears, the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) heard . She also denies accusations of bullying staff who raised problems with her - allegedly creating a 'stressful and unpleasant' atmosphere which discouraged staff from reporting problems. 'The NMC case against the registrant may be summarised in this way, the case is based on serious failings in her management role,' William Davis, for the NMC, said. 'It is not said that she was directly and personally responsible for the numerous examples of poor care delivered by staff at Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust, on the contrary the evidence suggests that her time on the wards with patients was limited. 'Rather the NMC say that she wholly failed in her management responsibilities to ensure, amongst other issues, appropriate staffing levels and the correct skill mix. 'The NMC also say the registrant took an aggressive and intimidating management style which created a stressful and unpleasant atmosphere for staff who as a result felt unable to report problems. When they did so they were treated rudely and there is evidence that on occasions they were reduced to tears. 'It was in this climate, the NMC say, that the problems at Mid Staffordshire became established. The NMC say that these failures amounted to misconduct by the registrant.' William Davis, for the NMC, . Harry was employed by Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust and its predecessor Mid Staffordshire General Hospitals NHS Trust between 1998 and 2006, the NMC was told. From 1998 she was director of nursing and quality assurance at Stafford Hospital and in 2002 was appointed director of clinical standards and chief nurse as well as director of infection prevention and control. The allegations put before the NMC include an accusation of putting patients in danger by failing to ensure adequate nursing staff levels on ward 10D between 2002 and 2006, the accident and emergency department between 1998 and 2006 and the emergency admission unit (EAU) between September 2005 and June 2006. She is also accused of putting patients at risk by failing to ensure an adequate mix of staff skills, on ward 10D, between 2002 and January 2006, A&E between 1998 and 2006 and the EAU between September 2005 and June 2006. The charges include allegations of failing to communicate with nursing staff in an 'appropriate' manner - allegedly shouting at nursing staff and using 'inappropriate language'. She told a ward sister on one occasion that another member of staff was a 'waste of space' and reduced one ward manager, named as Ms D, to tears, it is alleged. Harry 'tore shreds off' and ignored the concerns of another ward manager, named as Ms C, after Ms C told her that a patient was not well enough to be sent home, it is further alleged. Harry was employed by Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust and its predecessor Mid Staffordshire General Hospitals NHS Trust between 1998 and 2006, the NMC was told. She denies the charges against her . Harry is also accused of providing inaccurate information during a reconfiguration of services including telling the trust board in April 2006 that the impact of proposed cost savings would not be harmful to patient safety or care. She also provided inaccurate information to the hospital management board in April 2006 that a proposal to change the ratio of qualified to unqualified staff from 60/40 to 50/50 or even 40/60 would not have an impact on the numbers of staff and standards of care, it is alleged. She is accused of reassuring the trust board that nursing vacancies were being filled when she knew, or ought to have known, that recruitment at the trust was an 'ongoing issue'. Mr Davis said: 'The registrant will be described by witnesses ... as a manager who did not support the nursing staff and did not provide clear leadership and frequently communicated with colleagues in an unacceptable manner. He said during Harryâs tenure the trust underwent a number of organisational changes. It also suffered 'severe' financial problems, he added. Joanne Harvey, a ward manager at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust, giving evidence to the hearing, said: 'I would describe Jan as a bully. In my experience she did not use inappropriate words when addressing people, it was the way she spoke to members of staff. 'She was very confident, brisk and intimidating in the way she spoke to members of staff at the trust. 'She was aggressive, sarcastic and cutting.' The case comes after David Cameron apologised last month for the 'truly dreadful' mistreatment and neglect at Mid-Staffordshire, following the publication of the Francis report into events at the trust between 2005 and 2009. The public inquiry was ordered after it was revealed that between 400 and 1,200 more people died than would have been expected at Stafford Hospital from 2005 to 2009 amid 'appalling standards' of care.","Janice Harry was 'aggressive' and 'shouted at staff who raised problems'

Deception: Trusted office manager Sally Etchells was jailed for four years after stealing Â£39,000 from her employers to fund the upkeep of her seven horses . A trusted office manager who stole thousands of pounds from her employers to fund the upkeep of her seven horses, has been jailed for four years. Sally Etchells, 45, illegally overpaid herself at least Â£39,000 from the payroll of the small family firm where she had worked for 25 years. When she was found out the shameless thief, who was friends with the company's boss, refused to go quietly and instead tried to smear her former employers. Etchells - who was director of the Arab Horse Society and the respected boss of an equine charity - sent poison pen letters to suppliers falsely telling them the firm was in debt and would not be able to make payments they owed. Her actions nearly sunk a Â£500,000 corporate deal and almost caused the closure of Ken Rosebury Limited based in Rochdale, Greater Manchester - a vehicle bodybulding company which employs over 30 people. Etchells had worked at the firm for 25 years. At Bolton Crown Court, Etchells of Royton, near Oldham - who was chairwoman of the British Amateur Home Produced Arabian Championships - was found guilty of two counts of fraud after a trial. After the case Andrew Rosebury, 52, managing director of the firm, said: 'She was a family friend and had worked for us for so long, so it feels like a personal betrayal. Her behaviour nearly sent the company out of business. 'After the thefts came to light she wrote to many of our customers and suppliers saying that we were out of business. One firm she contacted was National Blood Service who were about to sign a contract worth Â£500,000 with us. That definitely would have sent us out of business. We couldn't have come back from losing that deal. 'My wife Jill was the one who spotted the thefts and we are certain that Â£39,000 was the tip of the iceberg. We could only afford to check the last two and a half years of our finances. Who knows how much she stole before then. Her behaviour was sickening.' Mr Rosebury said the small family company - that his father Ken set up in 1972 - recently had to go down to three-day weeks because of a reduction in money coming into the business. 'She [Etchells] would always tell the staff that there was nothing to worry about and things would pick up. The lads on the shop floor feel betrayed,' he said. Mr Rosebury said he does not expect the company, which employs 20 workers, to be able to recoup any of the lost cash. He said: 'I still feel very angry about what happened but I'm happy with the jail sentence. I think she got so long because of the letters she wrote. My dad is gutted. We all thought we knew her so well. This whole thing has been a nightmare.' Mr Rosebury's wife Jill said Etchells kept between seven and 10 Arab horses at stables near her home in Royton, near Oldham, and used to tend to them every day, both before and after work. She was also a director of the national Arab Horse Society, helping organise the annual show in Marlborough: 'I knew Sally very well and that is what makes the situation worse,' said Mrs Rosebury. 'The only reason it came to light was because she was on a day off and I was looking at the payroll system. At first I found the Â£25 and then other small payments. But the further I looked back I even found one payment of Â£5,000. Theft: Etchells worked at vehicle bodybuilding firm Ken Rosebury Ltd in Rochdale for more than 25 years before her theft was uncovered . 'She said at first that she was the victim but the police found a long trail of evidence.' Greater Manchester Police said Etchells was in charge of the payroll and had been responsible for paying wages to staff and herself. She was also responsible for payment of bills and outside payments to associated companies. When Etchells was confronted, she admitted the money had been paid to the account of a woman that looked after her seven horses. Further investigation revealed that between April 2008 and November 2010, she had overpaid herself by more than Â£25,000 into her own accounts, including paying more than Â£1,800 directly into the account of the woman that stabled her horses. It emerged she had taken a further Â£14,000 from the company, which had been paid into her own account over a three-year period. This was disguised as payments to other companies and the inland revenue. Etchells was asked to leave the firm but before she went, she wiped the payroll system to try and erase any trace of the thefts she had committed, risking non-payment to other employees. Bosses then found out about the poisonous letters she sent to their suppliers. Etchells also sent a letter to her former manager making threats about the company. Det Con Mark Zebrowski from Greater Manchester Police said Etchells had taken advantage of her position to steal money from her employers 'and lead an affluent lifestyle throughout this period.' 'She took large amounts of money from the firm, while at the time the work force was on a three-day week fighting to keep their jobs,' he said. 'Etchells has now been jailed for her crimes and I hope her former employers can take some solace in seeing her behind bars for the ordeal she has put them through.'","Sally Etchells, 45, deliberately overpaid herself from firm's payroll for years .

A Holocaust survivor is hoping to be reunited with his long-lost twin after spending his life without the brother he lost when they were liberated from Auschwitz concentration camp almost 70 years ago. Menachem Bodner, 72, turned to Facebook on March 2 to help him find his twin Jeno, nicknamed 'Jolli'. The brothers were separated when Auschwitz was liberated by the Allies towards the end of the Second World War in 1945. Menachem, who lives in Israel, is unable to remember much of his time in the Nazi camp but had for many years sensed that there was a part of his life missing. Desperately seeking my brother: 'Jolli', child survivor A7734 from Auschwitz, is being looked for by his brother who last saw him aged four when the Nazi camp was liberated . Quest: Menachem Bodner 72, is hoping to find his twin brother after a lifetime apart and has turned to Facebook to help him . A genealogist Ayana KimRon helped Menachem prove that he had a twin brother and that his sibling also survived the hellish Nazi concentration camp in occupied Poland. According to the Daily Beast, the genealogist said that after receiving news of his brother's existence, Menachem said: 'All my life Iâve known that he was alive somewhere; I felt that he was alive.' Ms KimRon was able to track down the twin brothers real names as Elias and Jeno Gottesmann at the Candles Holocaust Museum in Terre Haute, Indiana. After months of searching proved fruitless, the pair turned to Facebook, creating a page called A7734 - using the concentration camp number which was tattooed on Jeno's arm by the Nazis. The Nazis kept meticulous records of their crimes which revealed this information. Elias Gottesman was tattooed with the number A7733. The clues as to Jeno's whereabouts . are limited. Ms KimRon writes on Facebook that 'Jolli' was around . four-and-a-half at the time of the Allies' liberation of the Nazi-run . camp, having been born in 1940. There is a chance that he was adopted by . a Christian family in America. Long-lost brothers: Jeno Gottesman, known as Jolli who has the concentration number A7734 tattooed on his arm, was separated from his brother Elias (pictured left and right) The brothers were born in Munkacs, a small town which was formerly in Hungary and is now situated in the Ukraine. She added: 'Whatever name and location, his tattooed . number is A7734. And his brother still hopes to meet him. Please help us . by spreading the word.' Since the creation of the A7734 Facebook page, the response from around the world has been phenomenal.Â  The photograph has been shared more than 45,000 times and the page liked more than 12,000 times. Visitors to the Facebook page have left hundreds of comments after being deeply moved by the story of the brother's separation. One Facebook user, Rochelle Brown-Rainey, poignantly commented: 'My Mother is also a Holocaust survivor. She and her brother were separated for 15 years. 'I remember going to the airport with her and asking her if she brought a picture with her so she could recognize him. She very bluntly said ''He is my brother, of course I will know him when I see him''. I wish the Same Wonderful Moment for these 2 men.'

President Obama has nominated former assistant attorney general Thomas Perez as the next labor secretary, filling yet another second-term Cabinet vacancy. Mr Obamaâs newest cabinet member will play a crucial role in the administrationâs efforts to raise the minimum wage and reform immigration laws. Perez is the only Latino nominated to Obama's second-term Cabinet so far. Speaking at a brief ceremony in the White Houseâs East Room, the president said Perez was a âconsensus builderâ whose âstory reminds us of this countryâs promise.â Newest member: President Obama today nominated the Assistant Attorney General of Justice Department's Thomas Perez, right, as his choice for labor secretary . Appointment: Obama said Perez is a 'consensus builder'; if appointed, Perez is expected to help the administration on its stance on immigration and minimum wage . The president . continued: âTomâs made protecting that promise for everybody the cause . of his life,â as the nominee stood next to the president. The . Harvard-educated civil rights attorney is expected to face opposition . from some Republican senators, who say he has been too aggressive on . certain immigration issues, and too political. Before taking the job as . assistant attorney general, Perez was secretary of Maryland's Department . of Labor, Licensing and Regulation, which enforces state consumer . rights, workplace safety and wage and hour laws. In . choosing the 51-year-old Perez, the son of immigrants from the . Dominican Republic, Obama would be placing an already high-ranking . Hispanic official in a Cabinet slot.

Vladimir Tretchikoff's painting 'Chinese Girl' is one of the world's most recognisable images, one which can be found adroning walls in homes across the globe. The painting of a stunning, young Asian woman with blue-green tinted skin, raven hair and ruby lips was painted by Tretchikoff in the early 1950s. Up for grabs: Vladimir Tretchikoff's Chinese Girl is the most widely reproduced print in the world . Tretchikoff brought the painting with him during a tour of the U.S. where it was bought by a woman in Chicago from the artist himself. It has been in the same family ever since and is being sold by the original buyer's granddaughter at Bonham's South African art sale on 20th March in London where it is expected to fetch up to half a million pounds. Tretchikoff , who died in 2006, claimed that by the end of his career he had sold half a million large-format reproductions of the 'Chinese Girl', also known as 'Green Lady', worldwide. The real-life 'Chinese Girl', Monika Sing-Lee, was a 17-year-old girl who was working at her uncle's launderette in Sea Point, Cape Town. Tretchikoff spotted her and asked her to model for him for which she was paid just over Â£130 in today's money for two weeks of work. Pricey painting: The original is to be auctioned off at Bonhams in London and is expected to fetch Â£500,000 . Giles Peppiatt, from Bonhams, said: âThe iridescent hues of 'Chinese Girl' reflect Tretchikoff's experimentation with the possibilities of his colour palette, the green-blue patina-like effect of the sitter's face is uncanny, heightening the red of her lips and framed by her lustrous dark hair. âThe deftly- handled golden hues and decorative detail of her tunic emerge from the lines of charcoal on brown canvas, a combination of media familiar from works like ""Basotho Girl"" and ""Zulu Maiden"". âNotably, the combination of lustrous golden silk and the blue-sheen of the model's skin combine to produce an otherworldly glow: a luminescence that is the leitmotif of Tretchikoff's best works.â Boris Gorelik, author of the forthcoming book ""Incredible Tretchikoff"", said: âMillions of people - perhaps your parents or grandparents - bought a lithograph of this painting, hung it on their wall and admired it for years, if not decades. 'Maybe even you grew up looking at it. And today you can get the real thing - the original canvas.

Katie Coombs was diagnosed with the condition in 2009, but refused to take her tablets and avoided going to the doctors. On the day she died, she complained of feeling ill, but her parents thought it was food poisoning as they were unaware she had halted her drugs. Hours later, she suffered a seizure which triggered a heart attack. Despite prolonged attempts by medical staff to revive her, Katie was pronounced dead at hospital. Mystery: Student beautician Katie Coombs died of a heart attack at the age of 20 as a result of an epileptic fit after she stopped taking her medication, an inquest heard . An . inquest was told Katie, who studied Beauty Therapy at Manchester College . and lived with her family in Droylsden, was diagnosed with epilepsy . after her boyfriend gave doctors details of episodes she suffered in her . sleep. She was prescribed . Lamotrigine, a drug which would control the condition and which she was . to be repeatedly prescribed by her GP. But a neurologist who saw her . in 2010 was told no other seizures had been reported.

She then failed to turn up to others on February 3, 2012 and August 3, 2012 - five days before her death. Katie's father, James Coombs, told the Stockport hearing he had tried to get his daughter to go to appointments and had not realised she hadn't been taking her tablets. 'Much-loved daughter': Katie, who studied Beauty Therapy at Manchester College, was diagnosed with epilepsy in 2009 after her boyfriend gave doctors details of episodes she suffered in her sleep . He said his daughter had been sick on the day leading up to her death. Mr Coombs added: 'Between 9am and 7pm, she didn't show any signs of any fit whatsoever, she just looked like someone who was feeling ill. She said, ""I just want to sleep it off dad."" 'Then she was making noises which gave us cause for concern, that's when we decided that it was something more serious'. He added: 'I found out after her death that she hadn't been taking her medication. I was always under the impression she was taking it. 'She made out that she had an appointment at the job centre or something, she was a bit vague about the appointments. She said ""I'm not going, I have got to go somewhere else"".' Shocked: Katie's parents, Linda and James Coombs (pictured leaving the inquest), tried to get their daughter to see the doctor and didn't realise she hadn't been taking her tablets . Paramedic Claire Holmes, whose ambulance was directed to the scene, arrived at the house at 10.56pm on August 7, last year. She went upstairs and found Katie lying on her bed and her distressed parents in the room with her. In a statement, she said: 'Her legs . were twitching, I could see that she was having a seizure, so I tried . calling her name. 'She would scream a bit and look at me, but her eyes . were vacant. 'Her parents . said they hadn't seen her all day - her parents thought that she had . food poisoning, they thought she had been vomiting all day.'

The road to late president Hugo Chavez's final resting place in Caracas showed just how impoverished ordinary Venezuelans are, as parade pictures showed some of the most dangerous slums on the planet. While tens of thousands of mourners lined the streets to mourn former President Chavez's passage to the museum where he will be displayed indefinitely, it highlighted how severe problems in Venezuela are for who ever will lead the country next. Mr Chavez, who ruled for 14 years, died of cancer last week. Chavez's legacy: The funeral route of Venezuela's late President Hugo Chavez revealed the horrifying conditions in which many Venezuelans live . Tens of thousands of Venezuelans . gathered along that route today to watch the late president's body . cross the city in another choreographed show designed to keep Chavez . supporters in thrall, at least until an April 14 election scheduled to . replace him. All along the funeral route were . unmistakable signs that this 28 million-person country is not only . unsafe, but that its basic services no longer work. The parade showed bridges in dire need of repair and food shops looking sparse and understocked. Vying for power: Venezuela's acting President Nicolas Maduro drives a military vehicle while his Foreign Minister Elias Jaua (top centre), president of Congress Diosdado Cabello (top left) and other members of his government lead the funeral parade . Crumbling apartment towers and food lines often shared the pavement with cheering crowds eager to greet their departed Comandante. 'More than anything, the government continues fighting with everyone, and does everything badly,' said Francisco Olivero, a 54-year-old carpenter who lives with his wife and five children in the poor neighborhood of Catia, a few streets from the funeral route. Like many Venezuelans, Olivero said wartime-levels of street violence all over the city were his top worry. 'They kill people here every day,' he said. 'I've lost friends, relatives.' Elaborate mourning: Onlookers throw confetti as his body was being transferred from a military academy, where it has been lying in state, to the military museum . As thousands of bused-in police academy cadets gathered along the route, Olivero and his wife Yelitza Acuna were waiting in line to buy flour, coffee, butter and other food staples that they said have been hard to come by for about two years. The shop, which sat along the most trafficked part of the route, drew a crowd of people desperate for a few bags of flour. 'The word spread in the street, and we all came running here,' said Oliver's wife, Yelitza Acuna, a cook's assistant. Economists say government-imposed price controls designed to dampen inflation topping 20 percent have made it impossible for shop owners to sell basic foods at a profit, sparking widespread shortages. Pomp and ceremony: The presidential guard soldiers carry the coffin at the start of a procession in which Venezuelans lined up to bid their last farewell to Hugo Chavez. In the background a portrait of independence hero Simon Bolivar. Officials have accused suppliers of hoarding the goods and have invaded warehouses looking for sugar, flour and other food items in short supply. 'You can't find anything,' said 27-year-old lawyer Anglys Bericote, who rode a bus for four hours from the town of Cajigal to view the funeral cortege. Wearing a heart-shaped 'I am Chavez' badge, she said she was taking the opportunity to also stock up on basic goods. People in her town have even had to go without toothpaste and toilet paper, she said. 'It's all the plan of the private businesses,' she said, repeating the government's line of attack. 'They want to hold onto everything so that it riles up people.' A few blocks from the military museum, Jonathan Rodriguez watched government supporters pass by in red T-shirts bearing Chavez's image. Raw sewage trickled from a broken pipe down the street, and the 37-year-old insurance agent scolded his two sons for playing nearby. Lying in state: Religious and political ceremonies were held at the military museum, attended by Mr Chavez's chosen successor Nicolas Maduro . 'The majority of them don't complain about the problems here,' Rodriguez whispered about the passing Chavez supporters. 'It's as if they didn't exist.' Rodriguez said he doesn't have that luxury. Violent crime is so bad in his part of town that he and his family shut themselves inside their home every night by 6 p.m., only opening the iron gate covering his front door the next morning. Yet for Rodriguez, staying indoors might not be enough to protect him and his family from the war outside. Several weeks ago, a stray bullet penetrated the zinc roof of a neighbor's house. Almost all of Caracas' streets empty of people by dusk as residents with a homicide rate 20 times that of the United States. On Thursday, the U.N. Development Programme issued a study finding Venezuela had the world's fifth highest homicide rate, behind Honduras, El Salvador, the Ivory Coast and Jamaica. Many believe the police are a big part of the problem. Death of a strong leader: Chavez's brothers Adam Chavez, left, and Anibal Chavez, right carried his coffin, while thousands of people lined the streets to catch a glimpse of the hearse . In an astounding revelation, former Justice Minister Tareck El Aissami said in 2009 that police were responsible for up to 20 per cent of the country's crimes. 'I just stay inside now,' Rodriguez said. 'Outside, it's not safe.' The hills around the military academy are covered with bare-brick slums. More Venezuelans have moved into such slums during Chavez's government, casualties of a housing deficit that the human rights group Provea estimates at 2 million units. Official figures show the number of houses deemed ""inadequate"" in the country grew from 295,000 in 1999 to more than 404,000 in 2011. The growth of such neighborhoods has contributed to other problems. Due to crumbling or inexistent infrastructure, sewage all over the city goes mainly to one place: the once-pristine Guaire River, which runs along most of Chavez's funeral route. In 2005, Chavez had famously promised that Venezuelans would one day be able to swim in its waters. Trying to do that today would be nothing less than life-threatening. Military might: Hugo Chavez was keen to show off his army credentials at parades in Caracas . Retired truck driver Miguel Mosquera said he remembered the idyllic scene there decades ago, when the river was a perfect place to spend a sunny day. He lives in the neighborhood of San Antonio, close to the river and within sight of the funeral route. 'The city grew too much,' the 67-year-old said. 'In the 30s and in the 40s, people bathed in this river. ... Here, when it rains, it's chaos, you see that the river sometimes spills over when it rains.' Jose Leal, who had stopped by a bakery near the route, said he had given up on any change under the current government, led by Chavez's hand-picked successor Nicolas Maduro. 'It isn't easy, brother,' Leal said as Chavez supporters headed to the river to watch the cortege pass. 'It's worrying. It creates stress, stress in the family, stress at work.'","Despite crowds of mourners on the streets, Chavez's worrying legacy was visible in Caracas's dangerous slums .

Pharmaceuticals giant AstraZenca is to axe 700 jobs in the UK as part of restructuring plans that include the likely closure of its Cheshire based research and development facility, Alderley Park, it announced today. The part-British part-Swedish firm said around 1,600 jobs would be cut worldwide over the next three years as it overhauls R&D operations in three major centres in Britain, the U.S and Sweden. The move will see the end of drug research at the Alderley Park facility, for many years a hub of the group's R&D efforts. Job cuts: drugs firm Astrazeneca has announced that up to 1,000 jobs could go in the UK and that its Alderly Park facility will most likely close. Many jobs will be relocated to the nearby Macclesfield centre (pictured). AstraZenca said it was committed to . âexploring all options to ensure that Alderley Park has a successful . future.â Alderley Park currently employs 2,900 people. The drug firm . said 1,600 roles would be relocated to either Cambridge or Macclesfield, . with the majority relocating to Cambridge, but 700 people faced being . made redundant. It added a further 300 further roles could be relocated . outside the UK . The decision . to stop drug research at Alderley Park, the company's largest R&D . site, is a major blow to a region that has relied on a centre where . AstraZeneca and its predecessor ICI have been discovering medicines for . more than 40 years. It is also . another setback for the Governmentâs ambitions to make Britain a world . leader in pharmaceutical research, following an earlier decision by Pfizer to shut its R&D site in Sandwich, Kent two years ago and . previous cuts by AstraZeneca's former management. Alderley Park lies within the parliamentary constituency of Chancellor George Osborne. Unions accused AstraZeneca of creating a âskills crisisâ in the North West by draining the region of highly skilled research and development jobs in the middle of an economic downturn. The GMB said it was ""devastating"" news for the workers, adding that the announcement meant there would be a net job loss of 1,000 in the UK by 2016. GMB national officer Allan Black . said: âThis is disastrous news for the UK, and for the North West in . particular. The vast majority of the jobs to go are research and . development jobs at the Alderley Park site in Cheshire. There has been . salami-slicing of jobs at this site but this is by far and away the . largest slice of job losses at the site to date. âThese are cutting-edge R&D jobs . that are both well-paid and essential for a thriving UK economy. Highly-skilled and qualified workers will be put on the scrapheap.â Unite national officer Linda McCulloch said: âAstraZeneca's decision to relocate over 1,000 jobs to Cambridge is a massive blow for the North West. The company is creating a skills crisis for the local economy. âAfter 40 years of success and hundreds of millions of pounds of investment, we are at a loss as to why AstraZeneca is now pulling out of Alderley Park. The region desperately needs this highly-skilled workforce - they make a huge contribution to the economy and to the community. âStaff will be shell-shocked by this announcement. Skilled scientific jobs are in short supply and there are many families based around Alderley Park with deep roots in the community. It is going to be a real struggle to relocate families hundreds of miles away to Cambridge.â The company said the investment reinforced its long-term commitment to the UK and underscored this country's global importance as a location for biopharmaceutical research and development. AstraZencaâs . chief executive Pascal Soriot, who will present his detailed strategy . plans for the group to investors on March 21, said the programme would . lead to $1.4billion (Â£926.6 million) in one-time restructuring charges. Annualised benefits of the overhaul are expected to reach approximately . $190million by 2016. The . plan includes a Â£330million investment in a new, purpose-built facility . in Cambridge, where AstraZeneca aims to tap into an environment of . world-class academic and clinical life sciences research. 'This . is a major investment in the future of this company that will enable us . to accelerate innovation by improving collaboration, reducing . complexity and speeding up decision-making,' Mr Soriot said. Science minister David Willetts said: âAstraZeneca's decision to invest Â£330million in a world leading R&D facility in Cambridge is a real vote of confidence in the UK life sciences sector. âThey chose to make this major investment in the UK after considering options around the world. Our strategy for life sciences provides a very competitive environment in the UK to conduct highly skilled research keeping us ahead in the global race. âClearly the decision to reduce R&D activity at Alderley Park is disappointing. But the government will work closely with AstraZeneca and local partners to ensure this excellent facility has a prosperous future with new opportunities for the site. âI have agreed with AstraZeneca and local leaders that a taskforce will be established to co-ordinate work to support Alderley Park staff and the local economy during the transition. This will work to ensure a sustainable, thriving future for the site.â Mr Soriot, a former Roche executive who took over last October, has his work cut . out to turn around AstraZeneca, which faces loss of patent protection on . key drugs, which analysts expect will lead to an expected fall in sales . of nearly $6billion over the next five years. As . a pure pharmaceuticals group, without the cushion of alternative . revenue streams, AstraZeneca is particularly exposed to patent losses on . key prescription drugs, limiting its room for manoeuvre.

Mr Soriot hopes to reinvigorate the company by expanding on existing . growth business, including the new heart drug Brilinta, and using . acquisitions to buy in promising new medicines.","Cheshire-based Alderley Park research centre threatened with closure after 40 years .

Family breakdown is costing taxpayers almost Â£50 billion a year and the bill is rising fast, a new analysis said yesterday. The costs generated by family breakdown -Â  including subsidised housing, crime, health and social care and disrupted education - have gone up by nearly a quarter in just four years. The estimates, produced by the Relationships Foundation think tank, include large rises in tax credits for single parents, in housing benefit, in NHS and social services spending, and in spending on policing. Costly: Family breakdown is costing taxpayers almost Â£50 billion a year and the bill is rising fast, according to the Relationships Foundation think tank (file picture) The report calls on David Cameron to find ways to support families and to put family policy at the forefront of the Governmentâs interests. Foundation director Michael Trend said: âFor too long Governments of all colours have ignored the vital output of families and the multi-billion pound cost of their failure. âThis is unsustainable in any economic climate, let along the current one.â The report put the share of tax credit . spending attributable to family breakdown at Â£9.79 billion, up from . Â£6.31 billion in 2009. Including other state handouts, the total benefit . spending on broken families was put at more than Â£18 billion. It calculated that physical health . problems accumulated as a result of family break-up cost nearly Â£6 . billion, mental health problems Â£1.8 billion, social services Â£5.5 . billion, and that almost Â£3 billion is spent looking after children . taken into state care as a result of the collapse of their families. Breakdown: Almost Â£3 billion is spent looking after children taken into state care as a result of the collapse of their families (file picture) Police costs for dealing with crime generated by young people whose lives have been warped by family breakdown is said to be just over Â£5 billion, with a further Â£1 billion going on prison places for the more serious criminals among them. The total of Â£46.07 billion compares with Â£37.03 billion in 2009, when the figures were first compiled, the report said. It warned: âThe breakdown of relationships, whether married, cohabiting or never stably formed, has far-reaching costs and consequences. âThe emotional distress to those involved is considerable. The impact on childrenâs life chances is profound. âThere are also costs to society as a whole. These include greater needs for financial support as well as increased demand on health, education and criminal justice.â The report added: âThe Government has recognised the case for investment in the most troubled families and that the failure to support these families effectively undermines the life chances of children. âThe Governmentâs own figures calculate that the 120,000 most troubled families cost Â£9 billion a year. âYet the same logic does not seem to have been applied to all families.â It added that the estimates of costs do not include the impact of the latest benefit reforms or spending cuts. The . Â£46 billion figure amounts to three per cent of the countryâs gross . domestic product - its annual earnings - the report said. Just criminal: Police costs for dealing with crime generated by young people whose lives have been warped by family breakdown is said to be just over Â£5bn (file picture) The findings come at a time when state figures suggest that a newborn baby has only a 50 per cent chance of living with both parents by the time he or she reaches the age of 16. The Foundation report said that although the majority of married couples stick together, nearly four out of 10 marriages end in divorce, and cohabiting unions are much more likely to break up. It said that relationships are under heavy pressure from high housing costs, debt, care costs and long working hours. Mr Trend said: âFamilies in the UK are among the most pressured in Europe. We want to see the Government deliver on its state promise of applying a family test to all policy, an initiative that will need political will and courage but doesnât need to add any cost to the countryâs taxpayers.â","Costs include housing, crime, health and disrupted education .

Joanne Thompson, a senior staff nurse in the special care baby unit of the hospital, has been allowed to continue working . A nurse who helped treat twins who died from a huge overdose of morphine at the scandal-hit Stafford Hospital has been allowed to keep working. Joanne Thompson admitted a series of charges before a Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) fitness to practise hearing in London this week. But the panel ruled her fitness to practise 'was not impaired'. An inquest into the deaths of the twins, Alfie and Harry McQuillan, who died on November 1, 2010, heard that they were given an 'excessive' dose of morphine hours after their birth at Stafford Hospital. The babies were born at 27 weeks after the twins' mother, Ami Dean, was rushed to Stafford Hospital in the early hours of October 30th, 2010, after she began to bleed. Despite being born prematurely, the . identical twins had been in a 'good' condition during the first few . hours of their lives, an inquest into their deaths in 2012 heard. But it was decided to give the twins . morphine to stabilise them before they were transferred to the maternity . unit at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire where the twins . died on November 1st. The panel heard that the brothers, referred to in the proceedings as twin one and twin two, received 600 and 850 microgrammes of morphine respectively. They should have been given between 50 and 100 microgrammes. Mrs Thompson, a senior staff nurse in the hospital's special care baby unit, was accused of allowing a more junior nurse, Lisa Lucas, prepare for the administration and/or administer the drug to the twins with the help of a junior doctor whom she should have known was insufficiently experienced. The NMC panel found this claim was not proved. The nurse admitted not being present throughout the whole morphine administration process, that she did not check it was properly diluted, and she did not call for medical help to check the administration. Alfie and Harry McQuillan died at Stafford Hospital (pictured) two days after being given an 'excessive' dose of morphine hours after their birth in October 2010 . Mrs Thompson denied a series of . charges including failing to take the clinical lead of nursing care when . required in relation to the administration of the morphine to the . babies. Mrs Thompson broke down in tears as the aftermath of what happened was discussed. The hearing comes after the Francis . inquiry into failings at Stafford Hospital where it is estimated there . were between 400 and 1,200 excess deaths between 2005 and 2009. The NMC trubunal heard today that Mrs Thompson's 'main concern' had been to save the lives of the twins, the panel, led by chairman, Graham Park, said. In its written ruling, the panel congratulated Mrs Thompson on being a 'highly competent nurse'. It said: 'In the panel's judgment its finding of no misconduct in these . particular circumstances, would not undermine the public confidence in . the nursing profession and the standards expected of nurses. 'The panel was impressed by the numerous and consistently very positive . references and testimonials provided by your employers and professional . colleagues, including the Trust's lead consultant paediatrician, . the director of nursing and midwifery and a junior member of staff who works under your supervision. 'It is abundantly clear that all those individuals have a high level of . confidence in your professional skills, knowledge, and good character. 'There is no evidence to suggest that your current standard of practise . presents any risk to the public, and in particular to patients. 'Rather the evidence shows that you are a highly competent nurse of . considerable experience, capable of maintaining proper standards of . nursing care, conduct and performance.'","Alfie and Harry McQuillan were born at 27 weeks in October 2010 .

A baby who was born struggling to breathe was saved after doctors raced 140 miles to treat her. Alina Ahmed was battling severe lung and heart problems after her arrival at Burnley General Hospital, Lancashire. Doctors told her worried mother Naseem, 25, the only hope of saving her life was an artificial lung treatment known as Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO). Fight for life: Alina Ahmed was born with severe lung and heart problems. The only hope of saving her life was an artificial lung treatment known as Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) which works in place of the heart and lungs . Only three hospitals in England have the machine, and the nearest, in Leicester, had no beds available. So doctors at the ECMO centre in Leicester travelled up to Burnley with a machine which could stand in for Alinaâs heart and lungs - which were failing to pump oxygenated blood around her body. Ms Ahmed said: 'I was in a lot of pain and Iâd lost hope. A doctor said she was very poorly and I didnât think sheâd pull through. I really thought I was going to lose her.' ECMO therapy would normally only be available for babies at three hospitals in England. Worried: Before doctors dashed 140 miles to save Alina, her mother Naseem (pictured) was told hope was fading fast . After the Leicester team attached Alina to the machine in Burnley they took her to Newcastle - which also has a specialist centre. One senior doctor at the hospital said the case showed the NHS working âat its bestâ. After her birth on January 15 and the journey north, Alina spent nine days in Newcastle before being transferred back to Burnley General, where she spent the next six weeks. Now her jubilant family have been told she is well enough to go home. Naseem, whose husband Muhammad Jahanzaib is currently in Pakistan, said: 'When they said I could come and take her home it was just the most amazing feeling ever. 'Thatâs when I felt Iâm going to be a proper mum now. 'Iâm just so grateful to the doctors, No matter how I say it thereâs no words I can use to thank them. âIf it wasnât for them I donât think Iâd have my daughter today. 'Before this I had negative thoughts about the NHS, that they donât care about the patients. But after what they did for my daughter itâs completely changed. 'She was dying and they did everything they could to keep her alive.' Doctors at Burnley General Hospital (pictured) described the event as 'the NHS working at its best' Aside from having high blood pressure, . which should ease, Alina has made a speedy recovery and Naseem praised . all the staff, in Burnley, Leicester and Newcastle who were involved in . her case. Dr Meera Lama, neonatal clinical director at East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust, said: âAlina was very sick and on the night in question we thought we were going to lose her. 'The Leicester team, despite having no beds, were amazing in their support. Their quick response and stabilisation has resulted in Alina coming through a very critical period and she has now been discharged and continuing to recover at home. This was the NHS at its best.' Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) is used when a patient has a serious condition which prevents the lungs or heart from working normally. The ECMO equipment is similar to heart and lung machines used during open-heart surgery and uses an artificial lung to oxygenate the blood outside the body. The three centres that can provide the treatment for children and babies are in London, Leicester and Newcastle.","Alina Ahmed was born in Lancashire suffering heart and lung problems .

A cystic fibrosis sufferer has been saved from a double lung transplant by her love of singing. Bianca Nicholas, 24, suffers from the life-threatening lung condition which means that she needs daily physiotherapy to prevent mucus build up. She was facing the prospect of a life-saving lung transplant but incredibly, her love of belting out hits from her favourite musical, Les Miserables, has increased her lung capacity by almost 20 per cent. As a child, Ms Nicholasâ parents were warned she may only live to nine years old - but the charity worker refused to let her condition get in the way as she dreamed a dream of musical stardom. Now the aspiring pop star, from Beckenham, Kent, has sung for Prince William and already has a single in the top five of the iTunes chart. She said: âWhen people discover that I have cystic fibrosis, they can't believe that I'm able to belt out the tunes from Les Mis. âMost sufferers tend to have quite a bad cough and get very breathless, so for some it's surprising that I can sing at all. âSinging actually exercises my lungs, and because I'm singing all the time, my lungs get twice as much exercise, so it really improves my health.â She added: âI went for a check-up recently and the doctors told me that my lung function was up to 88 per cent - I couldn't believe it. âI'm lucky that something I love not only makes me happy, but actually improves my health too.â Cystic fibrosis is caused by a faulty gene that controls the movement of salt and water in and out of the cells within the body, it affects 9,000 people in the UK and is thought to cause two deaths every week. It affects the internal organs, especially the lungs, by clogging them with thick sticky mucus, making it hard to breathe. Experts agree that singing can help those with the condition. Ed Owens, CEO of the Cystic Fibrosis Trust, explained: âMany people with cystic fibrosis find unique ways to help keep their lungs clear and themselves well, and singing can form part of the breathing exercises that can help to shift the mucus, decreasing chance of infection. âBianca serves as an inspiration to thousands of others with cystic fibrosis that they can follow their dreams and achieve success at doing the things they love.â She has also dueted with Will Young, and even got the chance to perform for Prince William at a charity ball . Ms Nicholas began having tests for . the condition when she was just five months old, but was given the . official diagnosis after her second birthday. She said: âI don't ever remember being told that I have CF, I just always knew I had it. âI was probably about seven years old when I realised how serious the condition is. âNone of my school friends were going to the hospital all the time or taking loads of tablets every day. I suddenly realised I was different. âAs I've got older I'm used to living with CF. I have to do physio on my chest every morning to clear the mucus on my lungs, and I take about 30 different drugs throughout the day. Having improved her lung capacity, she now wants to be a professional singer . âEvery morning I take my inhaler, and a nebuliser which takes about an hour, and I have to eat a high calorie diet as the CF stops me from absorbing the goodness in my food.â Ms Nicholasâ love of singing started when she was five. Her mother heard her singing along to a tape and was surprised how good she was so enrolled her in an amateur dramatics group. Since then she has been determined to make a name for herself, and regularly plays gigs up and down the country. She has also dueted with Will Young, and even got the chance to perform for Prince William at a charity ball in 2008. Ms Nicholas said: âSinging for Prince William was incredible. After I sang he gestured for me to come over and we spent half an hour chatting. âI was going to audition for X factor at the time, and he told me that'd he vote for me if I went on. He was lovely.â She said âI'd practice until I could sing a whole song without coughing. The more I sang, the bigger breaths I could take, and I struggled much less in everyday life. âIt started to become clear that it was having a really positive affect on my health, and my doctors agreed.â The next goal in Bianca's singing career is to secure a record deal.

In the leafy avenues and boulevards of Brighton a very middle-class protest has erupted over the future of just one tree. The old elm tree has stood in the same place for more than 170 years, surviving two world wars and the ravages of Dutch Elm Disease. Ironically the threat to its future existence comes not from some private owner or property developer but from Britainâs first ever Green Party council. Locals have started a protest as they oppose the destruction of a 170-year-ol elm tree in Brighton . The protesters have occupied the tree while posting messages and posters opposing the destruction of it . The council says the roots of the elm are causing major problems on the pavement and the road and is also posing difficulties for wheelchair users and prams. And the local authority says the only way to solve the problem would be to fell the 60ft tree close to the Seven Dials roundabout. The plan has caused uproar among the middle classes and trendy inhabitants of BN1 who have decided to occupy the tree. Protesters clambered up the ancient elm while others have turned to a more artistic forms of expression to voice their opposition. A message and poem that was posted onto the tree explaining why it should be kept . Poems, ribbons, pictures of weeping faces have all been pinned to the tree as part of the protest to stop the bulldozer moving in. Tom Druitt, who owns the Big Lemon Bus Company in Brighton, is one of the protestors who climbed the tree to prevent the felling. He said: âMost people in the area donât want this going ahead. We will stay up here until they tell us they will not cut it down after all.â The green party council say that the tree's roots are causing disruption for prams and wheelchair users on the pavement . The local Green MP Caroline Lucas has come down on the side of the protestors not the council . Another protester said: âThis is a fairly organic protest, it hasnât been strictly organised but local people feel so strongly about it they have just turned up to show their support. Those protesting argue that tress makes up a vital part of the planet's eco system and should not be destroyed for petty reasons . âWe already have 5,000 signatures from locals and businesses showing their support. The elm is a healthy 60ft tree and I canât see how it is in the way of their plans.â The row has also led to a very public difference of opinion between Green MP Caroline Lucas and Brightonâs Green-administration leader Jason Kitcat. The MP has come down on the side of the . protesters saying: âI have been written to by many constituents who are . deeply concerned that as part of plans for this area there are plans to . remove this tree. It is very clear to me that this tree is hugely loved . by many people who donât want to see it come down.â Brighton and Hove Council say the tree . would be felled as part of the improvement scheme but around 8 - 10 new . trees will be planted. The council said: âIt is causing increasing structural problems to the surrounding pavement and carriageway.

A wealthy couple have run up a Â£2.7million legal bill fighting a divorce battle that a judge compared to a spat in a nursery. Mark and Jenifer Evans were âpennilessâ when they married in 1985. After setting up an IT firm, they earned Â£41million and bought homes in the UK, the US and Turks and Caicos Islands. But since Mrs Evans, 47, a barrister, began divorce proceedings in 2010, the couple have wasted Â£2.7million âpoint-scoringâ before the caseâs conclusion this week, Mr Justice Moylan said. Jenifer and Mark Evans ran up legal bills of Â£2.7million during their three-year legal battle which Mr Justice Moylan described as 'puerile' He awarded 45 per cent, or Â£18million, of their fortune to Mrs Evans, with Mr Evans receiving the remainder of Â£22million. The ruling, at the Family Division of the High Court, in London, revealed that the American couple met and married when they were only 20 and 21, respectively. They set up Confluence Corporation in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,1991. The judge said that, as the marriage was âunravelling,â Mrs Evans travelled to Arizona, with their two teenage daughters to confront her husband after learning he was at a conference with his mistress. The woman later went on to become his new wife. The couple owned a property on Montpelier Street in the Borough of Kensington, London . In retaliation, Mr Evans threatened to . cancel Mrs Evansâ UK visa and stopped her access to some of their joint . credit cards and bank accounts. The ruling also revealed that Mrs Evans, . who lives in a Â£10.6million apartment near Harrods in Knightsbridge, . West London, was âparticularly upsetâ after learning her husband planned . to give her replacement engagement ring to his new wife. In little over 12 months, between July . 2010 and August 2011, Mr Evans, 48, also spent around Â£130,000 on . jewellery, handbags and clothing for his lover. Mr Evans, who still runs Confluence Corporation, sold 65 per cent of his shares . in the firm to a venture capitalist firm for Â£26million. At a previous hearing Mrs Evans was awarded Â£26million - half of the coupleâs joint Â£52million wealth - by a family judge. However, fearing that after their . divorce her husband could legally transfer his company shares - thought . to be worth at least Â£40million - to another person, thereby denying her . the full pay out, she successfully applied for a second family court . hearing to agree a settlement. At a hearing in July last year, Lord Justice Thorpe described their dispute as âpuerileâ, telling them: âSomebody has to come into the nursery to make some rules.â He also expressed amazement at the . âcompletely disproportionateâ legal bills run up in the case, adding: âI . simply cannot understand how the parties can litigate with such . profligate extravagance.â He described their divorce proceedings as a âbitter forensic battleâ over their millions following their âtraumaticâ separation in July 2010. The divorce settlement was reached at the Family Division of the High Court where the judge described proceedings as a 'bitter forensic battle' âTo record that this litigation has cost a total of Â£2.7million is, to put it mildly, a stark reflection of the extent to which this case has been contested,â he said. âEach side seemed to be focused largely on forensic point scoring.â Yesterdayâs ruling effectively denied Mrs Evans around Â£8million awarded in the first settlement after Mr Justice Moylan estimated the coupleâs total wealth had fallen to Â£40.7million. He also decided to downgrade her share. However, he ordered Mr Evans, who re-married last year and lives in San Francisco, California, with his new wife who is expecting their first child, pay his ex Â£140,000 a year maintenance until the sale of their assets and properties when a clean break could be made.","Mark and Jenifer Evans split in 2010 and fought over their Â£40million fortune .

"By . Francesca Infante . PUBLISHED: . 04:29 EST, 16 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:09 EST, 16 March 2013 . Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said trusts found to be manipulating figures must be 'held to account' A criminal offence could be created to punish doctors and health chiefs who manipulate hospital statistics, it emerged last night. Jeremy Hunt is expected to announce the measure as part of an effort to reform NHS management in the wake of the Mid Staffordshire scandal. Last night the Health Secretary said: âThis is about a transparent, honest and accountable NHS. âPatients and the public should be confident they can trust information about how hospitals are performing and a culture of honesty and accuracy will help those organisations drive up standard of care. âIf NHS trusts are caught deliberately manipulating that information, whether waiting times or death rates, they need to be held to account.â If approved, the move will mean trusts could be fined millions and managers jailed if they are found to have falsified data on waiting times or death rates. Several hospitals have been accused of fixing high mortality rates by âmisrecordingâ causes of death. This makes it almost impossible for regulators to check up on hospitals with poor standards of treatment and for patients to make decisions on where they want to be treated. Nurses admit to being instructed to âmassageâ waiting time figures by adjusting the recorded time that patients were signed in or discharged. Up to 1,200 patients died as a result of poor care at hospitals in the Mid Staffordshire trust hospitals and ministers are expected to announce their measures to avoid a repeat of the scandal in ten daysâ time. Ministers believe one of the key failings at Mid Staffs was a lack of transparency about where things were going wrong. Sir David Nicholson Â¿bears some responsibilityÂ¿ for the tragedy at Mid Staffordshire, the Health Secretary admitted for the first time this week . They have already announced that trusts will no longer be allowed to use gagging clauses to silence whistleblowers. It emerged earlier this month that the Royal Bolton Hospital may have misrecorded the deaths of up to 400 patients. The criminal sanctions will be put in place to ensure that hospitals publish reliable data without manipulating figures to hit targets. Board members of NHS trusts and individual senior managers responsible for the data would be held criminally liable for seeking to manipulate information. The Department of Health, health regulators or members of the public would be able to report managers and hospitals directly to the police if they had concerns about any statistics. A source close to Mr Hunt said: âThe manipulation of data has been happening, rarely, but consistently for many years. We feel strongly that if NHS trusts are caught acting fraudulently about their performance on areas such as death rates or waiting times, they should be criminally liable.â More than a dozen hospitals are now being investigated over higher than expected death rates. The Health Secretary said for the first time this week that Sir David Nicholson, who has been described as the Man With No Shame, 'bears some responsibility' as the manager of the Mid Staffordshire health authority during the scandal.","Health Secretary says trusts massaging figures must be 'held to account'

"By . Laura Collins In Steubenville, Ohio . PUBLISHED: . 07:46 EST, 16 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:47 EST, 16 March 2013 . A key witness at the Ohio rape trial has admitted sending a text on the day of the alleged incident saying he said he feared the victim would be raped. The text, sent to a fellow Steubenville High School student at 1.38am on 12 August read: âBro they are going to rape that girl tonight.â It refers to the 16-year-old victim at the centre of the case and the accused, Trent Mays, 16, and Maâlik Richmond, 17. Ma'lik Richmond received text messages from a friend telling him to 'be careful' on the night of the alleged attack . The message was sent from the basement of the house where the alleged assault took place at a time when the sender already knew that the girl had been stripped, photographed and humiliated. Taking the stand, the former boyfriend of the âvictim,â an eye witness to some of the night's events, admitted to taking a picture of her on the floor lying on her stomach, naked and unresponsive, before sending the text and leaving the house soon after. Barely an hour later, at 2.36am, he texted Richmond: âBe careful bro.â Asked by State prosecutor Marianne Hemmeter, âIn all of your knowledge of what happened why would you send a text like that?â He replied: âI was worried he might do something stupid and get himself into trouble.â âKind of like whatâs happened?â she asked. He replied: âCorrect.â And though the witness, a lifelong friend of Mays and Little League teammate of Richmond, attempted to downplay those fears, they were underlined with a series of texts he sent that same morning to yet another friend. The string of communications culiminated in one sent at 2.42am which read simply: âXX got raped I think.â Asked why he would send that he replied: âI donât know.â Trent Mays is charged with rape and dissemination of nude images of a minor . In a text sent later that morning the witness described the âvictimâ as âbasically dead.â He went on: âThey were feeding her alcohol like it was water all night long.â The case in which two High School football stars stand accused of raping a catastrophically drunk young girl has taken over the city of Steubenville and caught the national attention. The attention it has drawn is thanks, in large part, to the extent to which it has been played out over social media. A now infamous instagram picture of the âvictimâ being carried from a party by her wrists and ankles and a video posted on Youtube in which a drunk youth mocks her as âdeadâ and âso rapedâ proved crucial to the discovery of a crime of which the âvictimâ claims to have no memory. Mays faces two charges: rape and dissemination of nude images of a minor. Richmond faces a rape charge alone. The prosecution does not hinge on establishing, âconsent or forceâ but on the âvictimâsâ substantial intoxication. Once again the court heard witnesses describe a night on which the âvictimâ â a petite brunette, wearing only denim shorts, a light shirt and flip flops that night â was seen stumbling, slurring her words, vomiting on the street and then later in the basement of a house to which she had been carried. It was a night of back to back end of summer parties, of underage drinking, slushies mixed with vodka, beer pong and music blaring. And according to three eye witnesses â each of whom attempted to invoke the 5th amendment and not testify â it resulted in the alleged victim naked, pictured, digitally penetrated and degraded. Asked to describe the scene he walked into when he arrived at the third and final house of the night, the scene of the incident, the âvictimâsâ former boyfriend said: âShe was on the ground. She was laying on her stomach.â Asked if she had any clothing on he responded: âNo.â He continued: âTrent was just walking around the basement â by her and away from her at different times. âMaâlik was behind her. On his stomach, by her feet.â Asked: âWas his face in a position to lick between her legs?â He said âYes.â The witness claimed he tried to stop the accused but was told ânot to worry about it.â Fury: The notorious picture posted on Instagram, right, and footage which appeared on YouTube, left, of the incident has sparked nationwide anger . Throughout a series of humiliations the âvictimâ was, he said motionless and unresponsive. At one point Mays attempted to âwake her upâ¦nudging her shoulders.â She did not respond. The next day, a female witness who arrived at the same house in the early hours of the morning andstayed the night, testified that she had to help the âvictimâ to put on her bra. The victim left in some disarray, without her underwear, earings, cell phone or flip flops â her flip flops werer later retrieved from the site of the second party. In the days since the trial began on Wednesday visiting Judge Lipps has heard hour upon hour of testimony. Much of the courtâs time has been occupied with the minutiae of play by play text accounts as he, like the victim, has been tasked with joining the dots of what truly happened on the night of 11-12 August. It is a task complicated many times over: by the unreliable sexual boasts of 16 year old boys, the various versions recounted by witnesses to friends, authorities and ultimately the court, the consumption of alcohol on the night, peer pressure and shame in the glare of scrutiny, multiplied by the fact that this is a town where everybody knows everybody and technical limitations. Judge Thomas Lipps is presiding over the court room in Steubenville, Ohio . Images deleted from iPhones, which many involved have, cannot be retrieved. Much has been made of the pressure that the media attention and the involvement of groups such as Anonymous has placed on witnesses, the accused and the victim herself. But according to Detective Jean Phillipe Rigaud, now an officer at the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation (BCI) but with the City of Steubenvile Police Juvenile Unit at the time, the initial investigation was hampered by fear which existed long before the rest of America had directed its attention on this town or this case. He said: âThe perception that I had . was there was a lot of fear, not related to the issues we have seen more . recently. At that point it really was all..I donât know for certain but . it seemd to be fear of co-operation, of talking with the police. Or, as some in Steubenville and beyond would have it, of speaking out against the much lauded Big Red athletes. Mays . for one certainly appears to have believed his status as a star High . School Football player â he was quarterback â and the power of Coach . Reno Saccoccio would be enough to smooth away any awkwardness. In a series of texts to a female friend on 13 August he responded to her question, âWhat did Reno say to you last night?â âNothing . really. We got to stay in for a week. Next time nay of use to anything . we are suspended from gamesâ¦.But I feel like he took care of it for us.â But that same day in a Twitter conversation the victim wrote: âI woke up naked like I seriously have no memory at all. Itâs scary.â She claimed to have undergone a toxicology test which had confirmed her own assertions that she had been drugged on the night in question. But MailOnline understands that in spite of her assertions no such tests were ever conducted â a fact expected to be exploited by the defence when they make their case.","Allegedly refers to high school footballers Trent Mays, 16, and Ma'lik Richmond, 17, and 16-year-old victim .

Le Pengouin on Bruni's new album Little French Songs, includes the lyrics: 'He has little sovereign airs but, me, I know him, the penguin doesn't have the manners of a lord of the manor ... Penguins are badly brought up.' Song bird: Carla Bruni has written a new song which allegedly mocks current French President Francois Hollande, calling him a penguin . According to a report in the Times, the song is widely being seen as an attempt by Bruni, to get revenge on Hollande for what she considers his disrespectful conduct . In another verse Ms Bruni takes a swipe at Mr Hollande's reputation for being ordinary with the line: 'Neither ugly, nor beautiful, neither tall nor short, neither cold nor hot, the penguin, neither yes nor no.' Mr Neither-Yes-Nor-No is a nickname for Hollande used by many in the French press to describe his perceived indecisiveness. Cringeworthy: Another song on Bruni's new album praises her husband Nicolas Sarkozy who she has described as 'virile, sweet and unique' Bruni also appears to mock the president's official portrait photograph, taken in the gardens of the ÃlysÃ©e Palace with the line 'Hold on, the penguin, you look all alone in your garden.' The new album includes a cringeworthy tribute to her husband who she recently described as virile, sweet and unique. The song is believed to have embarrassed many of Sarkozy's political allies and infuriated the Hollande administration. Many commentators believe the track will effectively blow up in Bruni's face and destroy her efforts to be considered a serious artist.

Judge Simon Bourne-Arton QC said he was 'probably doing the wrong thing' by letting burglar Jason Dalfred . Wheatley walk free . A top judge has said he was 'probably doing the wrong thing' as he let a burglar walk free. Judge Simon Bourne-Arton QC made the comment as he sentenced Jason Dalfred Wheatley who was once given a three-year jail-term for being a passenger in a stolen car which killed an eight-year-old boy. He passed a 10-month prison sentence, but suspended it, telling Wheatley: âI strongly believe that you should be ordered to serve that immediately. 'But I am just going to give you one last chance. But understand this; it is your last chance.â He suspended the sentence for two years with 18 months' supervision and a yearâs drug rehabilitation. He . added: âI firmly believe I'm probably doing the wrong thing here. If . you come back before me I will know I've done the wrong thing.â Wheatley, 24, was at Teesside Crown Court for sentencing after he pleaded guilty to a home burglary. He was jailed for a year for another domestic burglary in October 2011. Judge . Bourne-Arton said this might have been termed 'merciful' for an . offender with a history of drunken crime and flouting court orders. Wheatley . offended again - taking a vehicle without consent and driving while . unfit - and was given a community order by magistrates in November last . year. Within a week of appearing in court for breaching that order, he committed the latest burglary on Grassington Road, Beechwood, Middlesbrough, on February 1. He was seen climbing over a fence in a neighbouring garden, dropping a stolen laptop as he went, said prosecutor Sue Jacobs. After he was detained in the garden, he told police he'd been drinking and taking cocaine and MCAT. An . accomplice, Craig Andrew Gibson, 24, of Beechwood, Middlesbrough, was . caught inside the burgled home and sentenced by magistrates lastÂ  month. Burglar Jason Wheatley walked free from Teesside Crown Court after appearing for sentencing . He received a one-year community order with alcohol treatment, supervision and 50 hours' unpaid work, and ordered him to pay Â£75 compensation with Â£145 costs. Wheatley, of Beechwood, admitted burglary. When he was 18, he was locked up for four years - later reduced to three years on appeal - for aggravated vehicle taking. He was one of two passengers in the stolen Rover Metro that hit and killed eight-year-old Daniel Conroy Curtin in Riverside Park on May 16, 2006. This previous conviction was not mentioned in the burglary hearing. Duncan McReddie, defending, said Wheatley went from denial to confession in a 16-minute police interview on overwhelming evidence. He said Wheatley was determined to rid himself of drug and alcohol addiction and had sought help. After reading a letter from Wheatley, the judge said: âNow you say you have learned your lesson.â He said Wheatley had told him the same thing he told the judge for his previous burglary - that it was spontaneous and drink-fuelled. He told Wheatley he wouldn't accept any excuses if he breached the new order, and 'it won't wash' if he re-offended and said he was sorry.","Judge Bourne-Aston said he should be jailed 'immediately' - but suspended it .

He became a significant local landowner after the success of his books. Conservationists were also outraged by the sale as the wood is abundant in native flora and fauna.Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust launched an appeal in January to raise the Â£35,000 needed to purchase the land from the Lee family. They received almost 1,000 donations in just six weeks from well wishers all over the UK and were able to buy the piece of literary heritage. Mr Mortlock said: 'We knew that this was a special place and that there would be amazing support to secure it from our members. The Cotswold Village of Slad in Gloucestershire which was home to author Laurie Lee and the setting of his novel Cider With Rosie . 'It's great to know that in the middle of a recession people still value this county's stunning countryside. 'The landscape that inspired the classic Cider with Rosie will be protected.' Mr Mortlock said he was particularly thrilled as Trantershill Wood is next to the trust's existing Swift's Hill nature reserve. Laurie Lee's book Cider With Rosie was set in the Slad Valley . Trantershill is an ancient woodland of Beech and some Yew, Wych Elm and Elder trees and contains rare orchids, a bluebell carpet and roe deer. Laurie Lee died in 1997 aged 82 and is buried in the churchyard in Slad, opposite the village's Woolpack pub where he was a regular through his life. He became a significant local landowner after the success of his books and was an ardent campaigner against housing development in the Slad Valley. But his family, daughter Jessy Lee and wife Kathy - who still lives in the couple's home in Slad - put his beloved woodland on the market last year. Jessy previously said the hard decision to sell came after a person began hacking through Trantershill with a chainsaw to allegedly cut down wood and sell it on. She said the worry of what was happening to her father's woodland was keeping her awake at night.Jessy contacted Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust for advice and decided she wanted them to have custody of the woods. But she was unable to donate the land as it belongs to the Laurie Lee estate and instead offered to sell it to them for the minimum offer of Â£35,000. Jessy said she was delighted and relieved that the trust had been able to raise the money to buy the land. Trantershill Wood would be 'in the best possible hands', she said. Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust will create an entrance to Trantershill from Swift's Hill, with an official opening in the spring. The trust also owns Frith Wood and Snow's Farm nature reserves in Slad.","The author's family put Trantershil Wood up for sale last year .

Jack Dalrymple who has indicated he will sign them into law . If adopted, bills would be the most restrictive abortion laws in the country . By . Reuters Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 09:56 EST, 16 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:59 EST, 16 March 2013 . The North Dakota Senate has approved what would be the most restrictive abortion law in the United States, a measure banning the procedure in most cases once a fetal heartbeat can be detected, as early as six weeks. Senators also approved a second bill on Friday that bans abortions based solely on genetic abnormalities, the first state ban of its kind if signed into law. The bill would also ban abortions based on the gender of the fetus, which would make North Dakota the fourth state to ban sex-selection based abortions. Republican Senator Bette Grande at the state Capitol in Bismarck, North Dakota which approved two anti-abortion bills including banning abortions after six weeks or in the case of genetic defects . The bills, which passed the state House of Representatives last month, now head to Republican Governor Jack Dalrymple, who has not indicated whether he would sign them into law. He is expected to receive the bills on Monday. The ""heartbeat"" bill provides exceptions if an abortion would prevent the death or irreversible impairment of a pregnant woman but no exceptions for rape. A women's right to choose? The laws would ban abortions based on gender selection or genetic defects. Termination would also be banned after six weeks of pregnancy . It sets up a direct challenge to the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade that legalized abortion in 1973. Several states ban most abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Arkansas lawmakers earlier in March approved a ban on most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy that could take effect in August if it survives expected legal challenges. Republican state Senator Spencer Berry, a bill sponsor, said 40 years of medical advancements should not be ignored. 'The images and heartbeat from the womb provide strong and overwhelming evidence of - at the very least - potential life,' Berry said. 'And we have been instructed by the Supreme Court to protect that very potential.' At six weeks, the ban would take effect before many women would know they were pregnant, said the Center for Reproductive Rights, which represents North Dakota's only clinic that provides abortions, the Red River Women's Clinic in Fargo. 'The passage of this law is nothing short of a frontal assault on the U.S. Constitution, 40 years of Supreme Court precedent, and the health and fundamental rights of women,' said Nancy Northup, the center's president and CEO. The center and Planned Parenthood urged Dalrymple to veto both bills. More than half of the patients at a Planned Parenthood clinic across the border from Fargo in Moorhead, Minnesota, are North Dakota residents. Speaking up: North Dakota state Senator Carolyn Nelson, D-Fargo, speaks out against the proposed new abortion laws. If the governor signs the measures, North Dakota would have the most restrictive laws in the country . In favour of a ban: North Dakota state Sen. Margaret Sitte, R-Bismarck voted to approve the tight anti-abortion laws. Abortion-rights activists have promised a legal battle over the measures if they become law . When life begins: These laws would ban abortion as soon as heartbeat is detected meaning abortions after six weeks would be off-limits. Supporters of the bills say their goal is to challenge the U.S. Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling . 'With this vote, politicians in North Dakota have proven their disregard for a woman's personal medical decision-making,' Sarah Stoesz, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, said in a statement. North Dakota lawmakers have several other bills still under consideration that would put restrictions on abortion including a proposed amendment to the state constitution that declares that life begins at conception. That would be put before voters in November 2014 if the state House approves the provision. Statehouses across the nation approved a record 92 restrictions on abortion in 2011 and another 43 in 2012, which was the second-highest figure on record, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights.","Pair of anti-abortion measures include one that prevents women from having an abortion based on a genetic defect, like Down's syndrome .

Precious heritage: This rare 14th century Wenlok Jug was stolen from a British museum after donations had saved it from going abroad in 2006 . A Â£1 million medieval jug stolen from a British museum was found in a Surrey lock up hidden between stacks of tyres, a court heard today. The man who admitted handling the jug, . Ronald Nash, 23, from Tadworth in Surrey was jailed for three . years and three months . at Luton Crown Court. The Wenlok Jug is a national treasure, and one of only three in Britain. It is so precious that the museum in Luton, Stockwood Discovery Centre, cannot now afford to display it because of insurance costs after the theft. How the bronze 14th century Wenlok Jug came to be in Nash's lock up in Epsom, Surrey remains unknown, but it has now been safely returned. Lawyer Abigail . Penny who defended Nash said that it was 'so valuable that it was probably . unsaleable, which is probably why someone of 23 finds it's being offloaded on him'. She argued that Nash was too naive to understand the value or significance of the item. She also said that he was too frightened to tell the police about the jug. When the jug was stolen last year, Crimewatch launched a national hunt and Zurich Insurance offered a Â£25,000 reward for its recovery. Caught on CCTV: The theft from Luton's Stockwood Discovery Centre was featured on BBC's Crimewatch but the face was too difficult to identify . It . is thought the jug was made for either William Wenlock, a Canon at St. Paul's Cathedral who died in 1391 . and is buried in Luton. The other owner could have been William's . great nephew John, the first Lord Wenlock who lived near Luton and had . associations with royalty. Made of bronze, the jug weighs 6.1 kg and is 31.5 . cm tall. It is decorated with coats of arms, badges . and the inscription 'My Lord Wenlock'. In 2005 the jug went up for sale at Sotheby's and was nearly sold to New York's Metropolitan Museum. Its export was stopped that year by culture minister David Lammy after experts ruled it was of 'outstanding significance' Police who had been watching Nash and co-defendant Louis Kybert, 25, from Banstead in Surrey, also . found ecstasy and cocaine packaging in the lock up, as well as two stun guns disguised as mobile phones and body . armour. Kybert was jailed for five years after admitting owning the stun guns and being involved in supplying drugs. Nash's . sentence included one year for being implicated in supplying . cocaine, and two years and three months for handling stolen goods. Tony Hart, a family friend of Nash was called as a character witness for him. He said: 'Ronnie's never been no angel, he's always been cheeky, but he's always done good.' 'I don't know what's happened in the last year that has led up to this.' Nash was told by Judge Laura Harris: 'You have been extremely vague on the circumstances in which the Wenlok Jug came into your possession. 'Individuals far more sophisticated than you, higher up the chain were involved in this matter. You have got into something way over your head.' The jug was bought in 2006 by the Stockwood Discovery Centre for Â£750,000 with help from various trusts and private donations, which saved it from being sold to a museum in New York.

Prosecutor Fayza Benlamkadem read a statement to the court from Karen Perkins, the director of Luton Museums.

She said the knock-on effect had been that other valuable items had had . to be removed from display, and there was now a significant increase in . the cost of security which effected services that could be provided for . the community.

Reassurance: The Prime Minister of Romania Victor Ponta said Britain should not fear an invasion of immigrants from his country . Romania's prime minister has said that the UK does not need to fear an 'invasion' of immigrants because he believes people from his country are better off staying at home. Victor Ponta said he was 'rather perplexed' by reports in the British press that the UK faces a new wave of eastern European arrivals when EU 'freedom of movement' laws change in 2014. Writing in The Times newspaper, he said Romanian workers 'will not rush to Britain' because they will be too 'busy developing their own country'. Romanians and Bulgarians have had restricted rights to come and work in Britain since the two countries joined the European Union in 2007. But these laws expire on December 31 2013, meaning 29 million people will have the right to live and work in Britain unrestricted. Experts have warned that a new influx of immigrants - such as was experienced when Poland and other other eastern European countries gained the same rights in 2004 - could harm the job prospects of British people. Britain is likely to be an attractive option due to the ongoing economic crisis in Europe and increasing employment in the UK. But Mr Ponta said Britain should not worry because he is introducing a series of policies in Romania which will stimulate growth and strengthen the economy. He wrote: 'Our people are, by far, our most valuable, cherished and significant resource. And we will do our utmost to keep them in the country. The Prime Minister also suggested that British people should follow in the footsteps of Prince Charles and visit his country as a tourist destination. Prince Charles, the Prince of Wales, owns a house in rural Transylvania in Romania . The Prince of Wales is known to have a bought property in rural Transylvania in 2006 and once joked that he is descended from the notorious ruler Vlad the Impaler. Mr Ponta claimed that Prince Charles took a holiday at his country house after the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations last year. He said: 'The very day after Queen Elizabeth's Jubilee celebrations, Prince Charles slipped away to Romania for a bit of peace and quiet and a traditional organic meal in a secluded village where he owns a house. Romania can't be that bad, can it?' He also suggested Chelsea football club's upcoming fixture against Steaua Bucharest as an ideal opportunity for British tourists to visit his country. The Government has come under pressure after admitting it has no idea how many Romanian or Bulgarian immigrants will come to Britain when the border controls are scrapped. David Cameron has suggested that new arrivals could be refused access to legal aid, as well as some benefits and healthcare.","Victor Ponta says he is 'rather perplexed' by reports of 'Romanian invasion'

Michael Duthie was given 180 hours of community service yesterday after he admitted claiming benefits after a Â£250,000 lottery win . A lottery winner who claimed Â£13,000 in benefits after his win escaped a jail term yesterday. Michael Duthie won Â£250,000 in March 2010 but continued to claim jobseeker's allowance, housing benefit and council tax benefit, while spending Â£50,000 of his prize on buying his council house. Yesterday Sheriff Elizabeth Munro ordered Duthie to carry out 180 hours of community service at a sentencing hearing at Dundee Sheriff Court. She said: 'I still don't understand . your attitude or why you think your fellow citizens and taxpayers should . pay for you - why should they pay for you when you have Â£250,000 there. 'That's a bizarre attitude.' His lawyer also told the court that . Duthie was now appealing a ruling that he wasn't allowed benefits - . despite telling the court he could access his invested money to pay a . fine if necessary. Duthie, from Dundee, admitted claiming Â£7173.79 in jobseekerâs allowance, Â£1391.82 in council tax benefit and Â£4825.52 in housing benefit after his windfall - a total of Â£13,391.13. His scam was discovered after an anonymous tip-off. He told investigators from the Department of Work and Pensions that there was 'no money left' and it was 'all gone on the bookies'. The court heard that Duthie was living almost 'hand to mouth' - because he was not earning any interest on the 'substantial' sums he invested in bonds. Duthie's bank statements showed that Â£250,000 had been deposited in his account by Camelot on March 1 2010. It is unclear as to whether he won the cash on a scratchcard or in a Lotto draw. Ross Bennett, defending, said Duthie had given Â£50,000 of his winnings to his family, and spent another Â£50,000 on buying his council house. He said a substantial amount of the money - understood to be tens of thousands of pounds - was invested in bonds, but that had left Duthie without any cash. Mr Bennett said: 'He now realises that what he did wasn't right but he was in the benefits culture and it was like his lottery win was forgotten about. 'I hate to use the phrase a hand to mouth existence, but he's not getting any money - he's getting no interest from his bonds. 'He has not had any benefits at all for over a year, and that matter is being taken to appeal. Sheriff Elizabeth Munro, sitting at Dundee Sheriff Court, told Duthie: 'I still don't understand your attitude or why you think your fellow citizens and taxpayers should pay for you' 'I don't know his chances of success, however, but there is a possibility he will restart benefits. 'He thinks he has been harshly dealt with and his concepts that he could simply be admonished is completely and utterly ridiculous.' Sheriff Munro told Duthie: 'You seem you accept now that the world doesn't owe you a living. 'This order is a direct alternative to imprisonment, and if it is breached then you will come back before me and I'll have little alternative but to send you to custody.'","Michael Duthie ordered to carry out 180 hours of community service .

Barbara turns the scrap into her stunning sculptures that include birds, cats, squirrels, horses, zebras, stags, hares and even a preying mantis.

Finally there is some good news for Greece - tourism is bouncing back this year in an otherwise flat European market. The desire for a beach holiday closer to home for cost-conscious consumers in Europe is helping to revive tourism demand in the country, battling recession and a debt crisis. Doerte Nordbeck from market research group GfK showed in a presentation at the ITB travel fair this week that bookings to Greece from Britain, Germany and the Netherlands for this summer were up 10 percent. Good news at last: Sunbathers and Holidaymakers on a beach in Stoupa, Greece. Tourism is bouncing back this year in an otherwise flat European market . Tourism income for Greece, its chief money spinner, fell by 4.6 percent to 9.89 billion euros from January-November in 2012 according to the country's central bank. Arrivals from Germany, Greece's biggest tourism market, dropped by almost a fifth, partly on fears about a backlash on German tourists caused by Berlin's tough austerity demands on Athens. Alltours, Germany's No. 4 tour operator, said bookings for holidays in Greece were up 30 percent on the year by March 5, boding well for the country where tourism accounts for around one fifth of output and one in five jobs. 'The tourism industry in Greece has overcome the crisis of the last two years and is now back on top form,' said Willi Verhuven, chief executive of German tour operator Alltours. Troubled: A demonstrator clashes with riot police during a 24-hour strike in Athens in October, 2012. The tourism figures are a massive boost to the country which is currently battling recession and a debt crisis . Verhuven said the company was in particular seeing a surge in bookings from repeat customers who had ditched Greece in favour of other resorts. Europe's largest tour operator TUI Travel is also seeing a comeback for Greece, with bookings at the group's German unit up 4 percent. Bookings from the UK are performing strongly, a spokesman said.

Globally, the tourism industry - worth an estimated $1.15 trillion last year - is expected to grow by between 3 and 4 percent in 2013, driven by up to 6 percent higher visitor numbers in emerging markets, according to latest estimates from the UN World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO). It sees growth in Europe, the world's No. 1 tourist destination, slowing to 2 percent or holding steady at 3 percent as the region's debt and financial crisis rumbles on. But Germany's federal tourist association BTW forecasts growth of just 1 to 2 percent this year due to the uncertain economic environment. 'If the weak economy begins to seriously affect the employment market and domestic demand then this will also impact on the tourism industry,' group president Michael Frenzel said. Germany's national tourist board also sounded a note of caution. 'The European financial and debt crisis is still a long way from being overcome yet,' said Klaus Laepple, president of the tourist board. Emerging markets like China and Russia will continue to be the main driver of growth for international tourism, Rolf Freitag, head of tourism consultancy IPK, said. Asia Pacific is seen recording the biggest increase in visitor numbers this year, with growth of between 5 and 6 percent, followed by Africa, where arrivals are expected to increase by between 4 and 6 percent, UNWTO said. Last year, emerging market countries attracted 4.1 percent more tourists while their mature counterparts catered for 3.6 percent more travellers, according to UNTWO data.","Bookings from Britain, Germany and the Netherlands were up 10 percent .

His . friend Mike Azzi, who Pistorius calls Uncle Mike, was quoted in the . Sunday People as saying: 'We spoke about one or two of the horses. He's . asked me to try to get people to buy them for him because he has no form . of income any longer. Final goodbye: Michael Steenkamp also confirmed that the family were planning to scatter Reeva's ashes at Bloubergstrand, a beach outside Cape Town . 'He's selling off all his property and everything because of the legal costs.' A new BBC documentary Oscar Pistorius: What Really Happened has also made a number of other claims. One of the revelations made in the programme is that when the 26-year-old athlete was arrested he told police: 'I'll survive. I always win', reports the Sunday People. He was replying to a senior officer who told him: 'You could go to jail for a very long time, Oscar.' Pistorius was released on strict bail conditions two weeks ago. He was ordered to pay a bond of Â£73,000 and forbidden from returning to his house, the scene of the crime. His legal costs are mounting and once the trial begins they will soar further. Lawyers have confirmed the family is considering a civil claim against the Paralympic sprint star after the shooting at his upscale Pretoria mansion on February 14 . Pistorius' lucrative sponsorship deals with the likes of Nike and Oakley have been suspended, ending one of his income streams. Police have confirmed that a witness who lives 150 metres from Pistorius' home in the Silver Woods estate in Pretoria has come forward. They claim to have heard screams and shots on the night Steenkamp died. Police have now revealed that the door opens inwards and are investigating the possibility she was using her body to stop the athlete from coming in when she died. They are also working their way through the 'massive' number of texts on Steenkamp's mobile phone and are continuing to examine the 9mm pistol used and Pistorius' phone. Investigators have also confirmed that two dogs were at the property at the time.","Home in the southern coastal city of Port Elizabeth has been their bolthole .

The music director of the Royal Opera House has launched an astonishing attack on modern day opera singers by claiming they are 'weaker in body' and likely to pull out of shows. Sir Antonio Pappano, who is one of the world's leading opera conductors, criticised singers for pulling out of productions too easily, saying at times this was due to illness but at others simply due to a lack of commitment. The outspoken comments by the British-born conductor are likely to cause a massive stir in the operatic world, with its huge professional pressures and fragile egos. Sir Antonio's comments reflect the growing frustration at . the RoH over increasing numbers of big stars pulling out of productions . before the first night. It follows criticism of a performance of Robert Le Diable last year, which some critics described as 'catastrophic'. Pappano did not mention names, and defended the opera house's decision to stage Robert le Diable, but did not hold back in voicing his opinion of some of today's top opera stars. Referring to cancellations, he said: 'It happens a lot. It happens more and more. There's something about this generation of singers, that they are weaker in their bodies or don't care. 'I don't know what it is, but it's something that is very very frustrating for me personally.' Asked afterwards to expand on his remarks, he explained it was partly a health issue, with common colds tending to last longer than, say, 10 years ago.

The original male lead Juan Diego Florez also pulled out of the performance and was replaced by tenor Bryan Hymel. Since then German soprano Anja . Harteros has pulled out of the role of Elizabeth of Valois in Don . Carlo in May because she was 'not able at this point to stay abroad for . an extended period of time as originally planned', according to a . statement. Juan Diego Florez said: 'I was contacted by the ROH for the opera Robert Le Diable, as early as 2007. 'Some months after, during 2008 (4 years before the premiere took place), I received the score from them and took a close look at it. 'After that, always in 2008, I decided that the role was a bit heavy for me, and I informed the ROH that I was not going to do it. 'It's important to be clear that I did not have any contract, nor any kind of agreement with the ROH to do Robert Le Diable.' Diana Damrau declined to comment. 'You can imagine singers.

A Royal Navy veteran who threatened to torture two City traders over unpaid business debts was jailed for eleven-and-a-half years today. Joseph Fontan, 34, told Charlie Thomas and Andy Ritchie they would be kneecapped and killed if they didn't pay the debt. Fontan threatened to torture Mr Thomas with barb wire and told him he would chop off his fingers as well as making horrific threats about his children. Jailed:Â  A Royal Navy veteran Joseph Fontan, left,Â  threatened to torture two City traders over unpaid business debts was jailed for eleven-and-a-half years. His 'enforcer' Gurdal Sherifali is pictured right . He added interest to his Â£10,000 debt, more than doubling it to Â£25,000, and demanded he hand over thousands of pounds in weekly installments. Mr Ritchie, a former newspaper executive who helped take the Evening Standard free, handed over the Â£7,500 he owed because he feared he would be killed. Fontan told both his victims he would bury their dead bodies on a patch of land he owned in Essex.He first won their trust by claiming he was a top City broker setting up a lucrative oil deal - but was in fact jobless and claiming dole. He denied blackmail but was convicted after an Old Bailey retrial. Jailing him, the judge, Mr Recorder William Clegg QC, said: 'There are many feature in this case that are akin to robbery. 'The sentence is a reflection of the cruel and sinister threats that you made. 'They cannot be compared, in my judgement, to bullying. Threatening: Fontan told the city traders at the Corney and Barrow winebar in Paternoster Square, pictured, that their debt been increased to Â£25,000 . 'These are bad cases of blackmail with threats of serious physical violence. 'It is an unusual feature that, by dint of your aggressive personality, you were able to convince your victims to pay substantial sums of money which they didn't have had to borrow for fear they would terrible violence inflicted upon them. 'You had the ability to terrify your victims and you used that ability.' Fontan now faces having to pay back the cash he frightened his victims into handing over. Fontan's 'enforcer' Gurdal Sherifali, also known as 'Tony', was jailed for two years after he admitted assisting with the blackmail of Mr Thomas. But the 39-year-old will walk free within weeks because he has already served the equivalent of 340 days in custody awaiting sentence. Prisoners are automatically released on licence when they have served half their term behind bars.Fontan reeled in his victims by inventing a bogus business deal he claimed could make them profits of Â£70 million. He said he was trying to broker the sale of three million barrels of Iraqi oil recovered from Somali pirates by special forces. After they agreed to join his syndicate, he told them the deal had collapsed and demanded each man hand over his share of the Â£30,000 costs. Locked up: Fontan was jailed today at the Old Bailey, pictured . During one phone call, Fontan told Mr Ritchie: 'You have no f****** honour. 'I don't care if you beg, borrow or steal the money. 'If I don't have it in a week I'm going to come round and kneecap you.' Mr Ritchie said: 'I was very scared. This guy I know to be exceptionally violent. 'I've seen him attack people. I was scared for my life. I believed he was going to do that - and maybe more.' He added: 'When he's had a drink and he's aggressive, he turns into a psychopath.' Fontan started making threats to Mr Thomas during a meeting at City pub The Wall on June 14, 2011, after finding out he also owed money to Dickon Adam, who was also involved in the oil deal.The thug said: 'I don't f****** like you. 'Dickon told me you owe him some money, I'm going to take that debt on and you will owe me the money. 'You don't want to owe me because I am a nasty, aggressive man - you don't know who you're f****** dealing with.' Another meeting was set up at the Corney and Barrow winebar in Paternoster Square on June 17, where Fontan announced the debt had been increased to Â£25,000. He then lit a cigarette, threatening to burn Mr Thomas's eye and telling him to 'choose which finger you don't want'. Fontan also told him he would insert a copper pipe wound with barbed wire into his rectum and send 'two black men' to rape his children. He chillingly added: 'There are people buried out in Essex and you will join them.' After demanding an immediate payment of Â£2,000, Mr Thomas rang his brother Marc, who agreed to pay the money and then spoke to Fontan - secretly recording the conversation on his mobile. He then called police after hanging up. After hiding microphones on his clothing, Mr Thomas later met his tormentor in the same bar on June 24 after promising to pay Â£9,000 in cash towards the debt. Fontan, who has a previous conviction for kicking a Tube worker in the groin when he was refused entry to a locked station, was arrested by undercover cops as soon as the cash changed hands. He tried to blame Sherifali for the blackmail plot, but later claimed he thought his victims had conned him out of the cash. Giving evidence during his trial, he grinned in the witness box as he boasted: 'I don't have to intimidate anyone.' Prosecutor Lucy Kennedy said: 'Fontan was the one making the orders, and he used his technique of instilling fear in others to have his demands met. 'Like most bullies, he talks a big game and enlists others to do his dirty work for him.' Fontan, ofÂ  Fulham, southwest London, denied conspiracy to blackmail and three counts of blackmail relating to Mr Ritchie, Mr Thomas and Mr Thomas's brother. He was convicted after two retrials. The first case had to be for legal reasons in December 2011, while jurors in a second trial in August last year failed to reach a verdict on the blackmail charges. Fontan was cleared of false imprisonment and two counts of common assault relating to an alleged attack on Mr Thomas in the Corney and Barrow toilets during their June 17 meeting.

Reports suggest that the insects are . mainly concentrated in areas of southern Israel, but sightings have been . reported elsewhere. Chef Moshe Bassoon who cooks locusts . in his Jerusalem restaurant says he counts himself 'lucky' to have been . able to get wild insects for his eatery. 'You want them plump and meaty,' he . told The Times, suggesting different ways of cooking the insects, . including rolling them in chickpea batter and frying them in oil until . they 'turn red - like a lobster.'

'I had to bring a male and a female and the eggs to the rabbi for his examination,' he said. 'And I had to prove that there was a local tradition of Jews eating them.' The . locust alert comes ahead of the week long Passover festival, which begins on March 25. It . recounts the biblical story of the Israelite exodus from Egypt, during which, according . to the Bible, a huge swarm of locusts was the eighth of 10 plagues God . imposed on Egyptians to persuade Pharaoh to free the ancient Hebrews . from slavery. Pharaoh did not agree to let them go until after the 10th . plague, the death of the first born in every Egyptian family. Delicacy: While many fear the effect they may have on crops, some chefs celebrate the locusts' arrival .

Insects are not just something which features in Heston Blumenthalâs recipes, and are eaten as snacks or part of healthy meals across the globe. The practice is most common in Asia, but has not been unheard of in the western world. âInsects are a healthy, nutritious and tasty alternative. Many contain as much â or more â protein as meat or fish. 'Some insects, especially in the larval stage, are also rich in fat and contain significant percentages of amino acids and essential vitamins and minerals,â says food writer Stefan Gates, a panellist on BBC Radio 4âs Kitchen Cabinet. In Thailand it is not uncommon that schools feed crickets for lunch and in Cambodia young boys go hunting for tarantulas which they fry and eat.

After the match I cleaned my boots and washed and pressed my shirt, then packed them back in to my kit bag so they'll be ready.' Saturday's match at Stirling County's Bridgehaugh home, was arranged after Mr Roy revealed his birthday wish. He scored his side's try in a 5-5 draw against a team of County players and stalwarts aged from their 20s to 60s. The former roofer, thought by many to be the world's oldest rugby player, began playing when he joined the RAF during World War Two. He began his 60-year playing career at Stirling County after he returned home, and starred for the first team for 27 years. He later played for County's 2nd and 3rd XVs before turning out for the club's 'Wolfhounds' and several other 'old crocks' teams.

A 'perfect teacher with a dark side' who worked at an independent school has been jailed after admitting possessing more than 40,000 pornographic images of children. William Stansbury, who was assistant head at Ipswich School, Suffolk, today admitted five offences of making indecent videos and photographs of children aged between 10 and 14. The 46-year-old, who was living in Ipswich at the time but now of Ferndown, Dorset, hung his head as sentence was passed. Prosecutor Michael Crimp said Stansbury, who was arrested in August last year, had been driven by the 'excitement of finding new material and was never satisfied with what he had got'. He added: 'He seemed to be able to perform very satisfactorily in the real world where he worked with young people and disassociated that from what he was doing.' The images, which included more than 800 in the two most graphic categories, were found when police raided his home and seized a desktop computer, laptop and external hard-drives. Stansbury resigned immediately from his assistant head teacher job, which he had recently been promoted to, the court heard. At Ipswich Crown Court today, Steven Dyble, mitigating, handed the court references from community leaders, parents and children who knew Stansbury. He said: 'To the outside world he was a perfect teacher but he harboured a darker side. 'A great career as a teacher has ended. But he never contemplated any form of sexual contact with a child in real life. 'He had the opportunity, if he so wished, to go down that road but he didn't.' Jailed: Stansbury was assistant head at Ipswich School, pictured, until his arrest in August last year . Jailing him for 16 months, Judge John Devaux said it was clear Stansbury had been regarded as a 'kind and honourable' man by those who knew him. But he added: 'You have contributed significantly to the sexual exploitation and abuse of children by viewing these images.' He banned Stansbury from working with children and made a sexual offences prevention order lasting 10 years.","William Stansbury was assistant .

A meat processing plant in northern Poland has been shut down after it was discovered using rotten meat in their products. Health and safety inspectors halted all work today after a television program exposed dodgy practices at the factory, and alleged that expired products were used. Footage of green-hued sausages was broadcast on Polish channel TVN24 and an anonymous staff member said that 'tons of old meat' was added to new products instead of being destroyed. Bad practice: Production has been halted at the Polish meat processing plant after they were 'exposed' using rotten products in their sausages . Another worker can be heard saying the green sausages would be 'cleaned, dried and added to new products'. Deputy chief veterinarian Krzysztof Jazdzewski said today that inspectors immediately went to the plant and closed its meat processing section. A thorough inspection has been started at the plant, which, he said was called âViola.â TVN24 later said that the management of the plant in question has denied that stale meat has ever been added to its products. âThere are no grounds for the allegations,â TVN24 quoted from a letter that was signed by Krzysztof Miecinski, identified as the president of the board of managers. Health risk: Footage of green-hued sausages were shown alongside interviews with members of staff claiming the factory #cleans, dries and re-uses' old meat . Jazdzewski could not immediately confirm TVN24's allegations but said the program showed procedures that violate the law and that could be harmful to consumers. It showed old meat stored together with fresh meat, which usually leads to bacterial contamination of the fresh meat and of the entire storage area. Another problem he heard mentioned in the program was that processed meat was frozen and then de-frosted. Jazdzewski said there have been no signals previously of irregularities at the plant and that a separate investigation has been opened to explain that. The plant exports to European Union markets, although it is not clear whether the UK has been exposed to any rotten products from the factory.","Processing plant in Poland used rotten meat .

This is the moment the 804ft-long Hindenburg exploded over the Lakehurst Naval Air Station in Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937 . During World War I, the Zeppelin had been . responsible for the first Blitz over England. And in 1937, the threat of . World War II was impending. The Zeppelin was a wholly German . product. Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin, born in 1838, had been inspired . to develop his airship by the sight of tethered balloons being used as . observation posts during the American Civil War. After countless setbacks, he developed . his first successful airship in 1900Â  -Â  three years before Wilbur and . Orville Wright achieved the world's first powered flight. It was a tremendous feat which made . the count a national icon. The German Kaiser hailed him as the greatest . German of the 20th century. Over the next few years he improved on its . design. The individual hydrogen gas cells . inside the airship's canvas envelope were better proofed against . igniting the hydrogen with static electricity. Aluminium alloy produced the strength . of steel at one-third of the weight, and more powerful engines gave the . airships an ever-increasing range. And so Zeppelins became the first aerial passenger transport... later adapted for war.

Property tycoon Mr Kirch has only given one interview about his collection and has declined to give any more information. It is believed he originally intended to make a museum to show the public his collection, which started in 1968, before deciding to sell it at auction. Mr Kirch is well known for donating much of his fortune to charity - gifting all residents over the age of 70 in Jersey Â£100 gift vouchers every year for the last five years. He has said previously all the money from the sale will be donated to charity.

Zeppelins attack Britain in WWI . By CHRISTOPHER HUDSON . By 1912, the airship was considered one of Germany's deadliest weapons. The . British government was at a loss as to how to combat them. Shells . attached to grappling hooks were envisaged, and aerial minefields of . mines dangling from balloons on a cable, of which Winston Churchill . remarked: 'Since Damocles there has been no such experiment.' It . was actually a biplane, dropping a bomb on Tommy Terson's cabbage patch . in Dover, on Christmas Eve 1914, which represented the first attack on . mainland Britain for centuries. But Zeppelins were not far behind. Once . the kaiser had agreed to bombing raids on most of London except his . cousin's royal palaces, the count's airships were over here with a . vengeance, almost silently dropping death from the skies. The . commander of the German Navy Zeppelin Fleet believed that Britain . 'could be overcome by means of airships through increasingly extensive . destruction of cities, factory complexes, dockyards...' and a large . number of his superiors believed him. Many . Zeppelins carried incendiary bombs in the hope that they could start a . general conflagration. This largely failed, because half of them failed . to ignite and most of those that did could be easily doused. But . one raid on the East End gutted several blocks of business premises, . killing 22 people and causing half a million pounds worth of property . damage. A Zeppelin in flames over London during WWI. Some of the photos in Mr Kirch's collection show commercial and military . (right) types of airship that highlight the size of the industry that . came to an end before WWII . Until the middle of 1916, Britain . could find no defence against Zeppelin bombers - they flew too high, and . any Royal Flying Corps planes which did chase them were shot down by . the airships' banks of machine guns. But . in mid-1916 the balance shifted, when a member of the Brock firework . family invented explosive tracer bullets. The Germans fought back by . inventing Zeppelins which could fly at 20,000ft. These . super-craft encountered many problems, thoughÂ  -Â  if they weren't . destroyed by jet-stream winds, their crews were too frozen and . de-oxygenated to man the controls. By . the end of 1916, any hopes of using Zeppelins to turn London into a sea . of flame had dwindled. Not until the very end of World War I did the . Germans begin building vast new Zeppelins, capable of carrying a 4,000kg . bomb-load. By this time, . America had entered the warÂ  -Â  and the plan was to drop their deadly . load over New York, thus paralysing the will of the Americans. Thankfully, after thinking about the . sure-to-be awful consequences for 24 hours, the German Chief of Naval . Operations responded with the one word: Nein! The . Zeppelin did not lose favour with their creators after World War I. In . 1919 one accomplished the first transatlantic crossing by flying from . Edinburgh to New York against prevailing winds in 108 hours. Returning . six days later, in 75 hours, it achieved the first double crossing, and . paved the way for international airship travel. The . huge Graf Zeppelin, called after its inventor, was built in 1928. It . carried passengers and cargo in perfect safety for one million miles, . and seemed to represent the future of long-distance air travel. Just . as with Concorde after it, the Zeppelin's reputation was destroyed by . one tragic accident. It had been, like Concorde, the zenith in luxury . travel. But it was doomedÂ  -Â  the fate of the Hindenburg ensured the . floating airship would always be synonymous with disaster. But . even before the Hindenburg, question marks were being raised. Helium . was non-flammable, yes, but helium-fuelled airships were also fragile . and had a chequered history. Of four American-built airships, two ditched in the sea and one was wrecked in violent winds. The . British used rigid airships for passenger mail, but our airship . programme came to an end after the appalling tragedy of R-101. France . and Italy had similar experiences. Yet . somehow the airship is too seductive a vision for people to give up on . it. It floats like a butterfly as it travels quickly and silently to its . destination. Helium-filled . airships such as the Stella Artois Star over London have yet to prove . themselves in bad conditions. But the new generation of Zeppelins, built . in the city of Friedrichshafen, where the only truly successful giant . airships have been made, may have put together that broken mould and . given back travel's ultimate luxury.","David Kirch, from Jersey, has nearly 600 items for sale in second of four auctions .

She may not look like your average crime-fighter, but great-grandmother Mary Pickles has been keeping the streets of her hometown safe for the last few months with her lone nightly patrols. Mrs Pickles, 87, forgoes an early night with a cup of cocoa to patrol the streets near her from 11pm until 3am to help drunks in distress and prevent fights before they happen. The retired postmistress thwarts potential trouble by handing out jelly babies and chocolate to feuding yobs to calm them down and has even been called Mother Teresa. Fighting crime with sweets: Mary Pickles volunteers as a Street Pastor with her local church, offering Jelly Babies to revellers to prevent drunken fights on Friday and Saturday night in Burnley, Lancashire . Good Samaritan: Mary Pickles has five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren - some of whom she sees on nights out while acting as a 'Street Pastor' She also has a stash of flip-flops in her backpack to hand to women who can no longer manage walking home in their high heels so they don't have to go bare-footed. The kind-heated even phones taxis for party-goers who are too drunk to call themselves. The five-foot-tall widow, who worked as a nurse in the Second World War, is part of a team looking after weekend revellers falling out of the pubs and nightclubs in Burnley, Lancashire, as a Street Pastor with her local church. She said: 'I love every minute of my role and we are well received on the streets by all the pub and club goers. Rewarding work: Mrs Pickles says she loves 'every minute' while out on the streets helping people make their way home . 'My five grandchildren said it was too dangerous to be on the streets at that time of night - but I have never been frightened and many of the people we meet tell me I remind them of their own grandmothers.' She added: 'The police say that they couldn't do what we do because we go out as friends rather than as an authority figure with armour. 'We are meeting with people and talking to punters, bar managers and doormen all night and I have always got a little stash of jelly babies to keep me going. 'I can only recall a couple of unpleasant arguments between people when they come out of the pubs. 'I will go over and hand out some chocolate and jelly babies and start chatting to them and by the time they leave they've calmed down and the good news is they've probably forgotten what they were arguing about. 'I sometimes bump into my grandchildren in the early hours and they still tell me off saying I should be at home in bed at that time - but I think they know now I'm independent enough to handle it.' Mrs Pickles, who has done various types of voluntary work in the community, became a Street Pastor after her church group got involved in dealing with problem locals on the streets. She added: 'I am the oldest in the team and we patrol the streets from 11pm to 3am looking for people who need help after their night out. 'We are all volunteers. There are people from different churches and we have a rota of who does which weekend. We start in the town centre and split up into different directions but never go further than where the bars and clubs are.' Mrs Pickles, along with the other volunteers, help pub and club goers who may be a little worse for wear when they leave to go home. Taking no nonsense: As well as handing out sweets, Mrs Pickles hands out flip-flops to female revellers who can no longer walk in their high-heels, and even books cabs for those too drunk to do so . She said: 'On a Friday night there are three people who are out and on Saturday we have four out because it's the busy night. We have a break in between so we aren't out for four hours straight. There's a rest and rescue room that we can go to for a cuppa. 'We help people by putting them into taxis so that they get home safely. They come to us for flip flops because by the end of the night their feet might be hurting and we don't want them to walk on glass. We also sweep up the smashed glass and put it all in the bin. Brave: Mary Pickles, pictured on her wedding day in 1945 to her husband William, was also a nurse during WWII . 'We have a nurse in the rescue room who . tends to injuries, which happen quite often. Some girls slip and fall in . their high heels and hurt themselves on the floor where there might be . smashed glass. That usually happens when they have had too much to . drink.' Despite the dark streets, Mrs Pickles says she feels safe. She added: 'There are cameras all around and we have phones so that we can contact each other throughout the night. 'We had to do first aid training and go to various talks about what kind of problems we may come across, but that was very helpful because it prepares you for what might happen. 'During the war I was a nurse though so I have a good background in first aid.' Mrs Pickles lived in Barrowford, Lancashire, with her late husband William where they ran a post office together until they retired. They retired to the seaside at Fleetwood in 1985, but her husband died just months later and Mrs Pickles returned to the Burnley area. She added 'People always tell me I remind them of their grandmother, which is nice. I have one son, five grandchildren and three great grandchildren. 'I remember one girl was really drunk and slumped on a bench and couldn't speak. We had to stay with her and try to find out where she lived so that she could get home safe. It worries me how much young people drink these days. 'I was once shouted at by a drunken man that I was like Mother Teresa but I suppose that's not a bad thing.' The Street Pastors started in Lambeth and Hackney in London with just 18 volunteers and is now in 18 of London's 32 boroughs and over 20 other UK locations with over 700 volunteers. A spokesman for the Burnley group said: 'Over the time we have been operating we have been informed by the police and Burnley Borough Council that they have noticed a remarkable decrease in the crime rate due to the 'over exuberance' of some of our young people. 'We have been involved in mediating between arguments, helping with First Aid, alwaysensuring young people are safe whilst they are out enjoying themselves. Mary is a great asset to the team and very popular with the locals.'","Former postmistress Mary Pickles -  a 'Street Pastor' with her local church - looks after drunken revellers on the streets of Burnley, Lancashire .

Appeal: Lawyers acting for Oscar Pistorius, right, accused of shooting dead Reeva Steenkamp, left, want his bail conditions relaxed and passports returned so he can travel overseas . Lawyers acting for 'blade runner' Oscar Pistorius - accused of shooting dead his girlfriend - want his bail conditions relaxed and passports returned so he can travel overseas, it emerged today. Pistorius, charged with the Valentine's Day murder of Reeva Steenkamp, 29, was released on strict bail conditions two weeks ago. He was ordered to pay a bond of 1 million rand ($110,000), hand over his passports and forbidden from returning to his house, the scene of the crime. But South African television channel eNCA said today that Pistorius and his lawyers felt his bail conditions were unfair. 'In papers before the high court they argue that Magistrate Desmond Nair was wrong to order Pistorius to hand over his passport and travel documents given that the magistrate found the athlete was not a proven flight risk,' the report said. Pistorius' defence said he should be allowed to travel if he won consent from the detective working on the case. They also argued that mandatory alcohol and drug tests were unnecessary and there was no need for him to report to a police station twice a week or be visited by a probation officer. The case of the 26-year-old Olympic and Paralympic track star, a double amputee since infancy, stunned a nation that holds him up as hero who triumphed over adversity to compete with able-bodied athletes at the highest levels of sport. On Thursday Warrant Officer Hilton . Botha, the detective who was pulled off the investigation after it . emerged he himself faced attempted murder charges, resigned from the . force. Pistorius is on bail awaiting trial for the murder of the former model after she was shot four times at his property on Valentine's Day. Accused: Olympic athlete Pistorius was released on strict bail conditions two weeks ago . Successful: Pistorius is pictured winning gold in the men's 400-metre T44 final at the 2012 Paralympics . It is believed Pistorius' defence will be that he mistook her for an intruder. It is thought that the trial could be up to a year in waiting after the double-amputee was granted bail after a two-hour court hearing last month. Desmond Nair, who reached the decision, deemed Pistorius not to be a flight risk, and was unlikely to commit further acts of violence when released from custody. Happier times: Pistorius, right, and his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp pose for a picture . Conditions of his release include that he surrenders his passports and travel documents, does not visit his house where the model died and does not use any prohibited substances. He is also banned from drinking alcohol. Pistorius, is charged with one count of premeditated murder over the February 14 killing of the FHM cover girl. He says the shooting was accidental because he thought she was a dangerous intruder inside his home. Mr Nair said Pistorius' affidavit, in which he gave his version of the events of the shooting in a sworn statement, had helped his application for bail in Pretoria Magistrate's Court. Rumours regarding the personal lives of the famous couple have been well documented. Needles and substances found at the property that were allegedly pointing towards testosterone injections have since being discounted as being used for a herbal remedy to aid muscle recovery. It has also been reported that Reeva was pregnant at the time of the shooting, a claim which has been fiercely denied by the deceased's family who have said that the post mortem proved this was not the case. It is unclear when Pistorius' bail appeal will be heard. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Pistorius has been charged with the murder of Reeva Steenkamp, 29 .

Nigel Martin-Smith, the music promoter who formed Take That in 1990, is suing the owners of a recently-launched venue in Birmingham called 'Queer Street' in the High Court. He claims they are exploiting the reputation of Bar Queer, a bar and club on Canal Street in Manchester's Gay Village, which he has owned through companies since it opened in 2003. Copycat? Gay venue Queer Street opened in September in Birmingham . Suing: Mr Martin-Smith has owned Bar Queer, a popular venue on Manchester's Canal Street, since 2003 . Mr Martin-Smith contacted his lawyers in September last year, when The Nightingale (UK) Ltd, a company headed by the director of Birmingham Gay Pride, Lawrence Barton, opened âQueer Streetâ, in Hurst Street, Birmingham. The music mogul was complaining about the use of the word 'queer' by the new bar. In a High Court writ issued by Bar Queer Ltd, barrister, Robert Onslow, says the venue 'has accrued goodwill in its business which has become exclusively denoted by the word ""Queer""'. He argues that as much as Â£60,000-a-month has been spent on fortifying the barâs reputation by advertising in the gay press and magazines since it opened. Mr Onslow claims the 'exclusive goodwill' attached to the word 'Queer' 'extends nationally', is the property of the Manchester bar and Queer Street is causing public confusion. Not happy: Music promoter, Nigel Martin-Smith, who formed Take That, right, feels his Manchester bar has accrued 'goodwill' since it opened in 2003 which his Birmingham rival is exploiting . The former boyband manager is demanding an injunction requiring the 'obliteration' of the word 'Queer' from 'all articles and premises' in connection with the Birmingham bar, along with damages and legal costs. The barrister added that Bar Queerâs goodwill could be 'tarnished and diluted' unless its Birmingham rival is forced to change its name. Andrew Norris, for the owners of Queer Street, disputes that Bar Queerâs goodwill exends across the UK and says in his clientsâ defence: 'It is denied that the Queer Street name and logo give rise to a likelihood of deception in the minds of the relevant public. 'The only element common to the name and logo of both bars is the word Queer. Both bars are directed towards the gay community. The word Queer is commonly and colloquially understood as describing someone who is gay, thus Queer in these circumstances has a descriptive meaning. 'References to queer bars or nightclubs would be understood by members of the relevant public to be a reference to a bar or nightclub that was directed to members of the gay and lesbian community. 'It is admitted that a bar has traded in Manchester under and by reference to the name QUEER for several years. It is admitted that the bar has acquired a reputation and goodwill in the gay community in and around Manchester. It is denied that any such goodwill extends throughout the UK. 'If the claimant is the owner of the alleged goodwill, it had only limited value,' concludes Mr Norris.","Nigel Martin-Smith, who formed Take That, suing Queer Street, Birmingham .
