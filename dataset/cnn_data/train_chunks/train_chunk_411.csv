"Massachusetts State Police photographer Sean Murphy, who leaked pictures of bloody Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, has retired, saying Thursday on CNN's ""New Day"" that he has no regrets. ""The way I see it, Chris,"" the retired sergeant said to CNN's Chris Cuomo, ""there's no way I couldn't do it."" Murphy's retirement comes after a brief suspension, a transfer to a remote overnight patrol job and a negotiated settlement in which he gave up five days of vacation pay, he said Thursday. The 25-year police veteran leaked photos of the surviving bombing suspect emerging from the boat where he had been hiding from a massive manhunt after the marathon bombings, which killed three people and injured at least 264. He was one of countless Boston-area residents stunned and angry about a Rolling Stone cover photo of Tsarnaev, taken from one of Tsarnaev's social media accounts, that Murphy and others thought depicted the suspect in a glamorous light. The image shows Tsarnaev with long, curly hair, a mustache and goatee, gazing into the camera. In contrast with the Rolling Stone photo, which some said looked like a picture of a young rock star, Murphy said his photographs showed ""the true image of terror."" In the images, which he leaked to Boston magazine, Tsarnaev is shown dazed and bloody, a police sharpshooter's laser sight trained on his forehead. ""That was the reality,"" Murphy said.  ""The image of that guy in the boat was the true image of terror, not the one that was fluffed and buffed for the cover of Rolling Stone."" He and his attorney, Lenny Kasten, rejected claims that the leak could have harmed the legal case against Tsarnaev, who faces two federal charges in connection with the bombings. Murphy was not acting as a crime scene photographer, and his photographs were never part of the criminal case, they said. ""Sgt. Murphy would never have done anything to jeopardize that case,"" Kasten said. In July, Murphy, 48, was suspended with pay for one day for the leak. A month later, he was transferred from his job as a tactical photographer at state police headquarters to a rural patrol job working the overnight shift. At the time, state police officials said the transfer was not a demotion or a punishment. Thursday, Murphy said he doesn't hold anything against the department. ""They had to do something,"" he said. ""I have nothing but high respect for the Massachusetts State Police and the men and women I've worked with for 25 years,"" he said. Murphy said Thursday he doesn't know what he'll do next.","Sgt.

"Dozens of video-capable smartphones -- most of them Steve Jobs' own creations -- peered out over the sea of technology journalists like digital periscopes. Nothing particularly video-worthy was going on in that moment: It was January 2010, and a bunch of us tech writers, wearing plaid and skinny jeans and funny hats, were waiting in line outside the Yerba Buena Center in San Francisco for an Apple news conference. But a line outside a news conference where Steve Jobs will appear is no normal line. It's the kind of thing you might just want to record every second of. And so, when our media handlers, wearing bright T-shirts with the simple Apple logo, let us into the building where Jobs would unveil his company's ""magical"" iPad, pretty much everyone in the audience raised his or her iPhone in unison and clicked ""record."" I'm sure our collective scramble down a hall toward a dimly lit auditorium was recorded and uploaded dozens of times. Apple's revolutionary co-founder, who died Wednesday at the age of 56, had that kind of power over people -- even the ostensibly objective technology press corps, which breathlessly hangs on Apple's announcements as if their gadgets have the power to change the world. Which, if we're being honest, they do. ""The world has lost a visionary,"" President Barack Obama said in a statement posted Wednesday night on the White House blog. ""And there may be no greater tribute to Steve's success than the fact that much of the world learned of his passing on a device he invented."" ""So much talk on Twitter of Steve Jobs, but Twitter HQ has been eerily quiet the past few hours save the clicking of keyboards he tailored,"" Twitter designer Mark Trammell posted on his popular Twitter feed. All around the world, it seems, people used the technology Jobs created to remark on his impact and his passing -- a testament to the personal impact Apple's suite of iProducts has on many of our lives. Regardless of your technological tack -- whether you're addicted to that red light that blinks on top of the BlackBerry or swear your allegiance to the Android overlords -- it's hard to deny the industry-changing power of Jobs and the Apple brand. Before the iPhone, an app-running, touch-screen device didn't exist. It was the first true smartphone, just as the iPad was the first true tablet computer. But way before that, back in a California garage in the 1970s, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak essentially kick-started the personal computer revolution. In part, I owe the fact that I'm able to type this story and send it to you over the Internet to the vision of Jobs and Wozniak. If the technological history explains part of the hype that surrounds every press conference Jobs presided over, his personal life tells more of the story. Gallery: Steve Jobs' life offstage . After we iPhone-holding hordes made our way into the auditorium where Jobs would reveal Apple's tablet computer, I took a seat next to a buttoned-up tech analyst and noticed the music playing over the loudspeakers: Bob Dylan's ""Like a Rolling Stone."" ""How does it feeeeeeeel...."" Wired wrote on its live blog of the event, quoting the lyrics. (In case you're not familiar with that phenomenon, tech bloggers, myself included, post -- instantly and publicly  -- pretty much every word Steve Jobs utters at these press conferences. Apple doesn't allow live video feeds, so these insta-blogs are the only way to get information about new Apple gadgets out to the salivating public in real time). When Jobs emerged, the audience greeted him with a standing ovation. Again -- all iPhones in the air. As he paced the stage in front of a massive, glowing PowerPoint-style presentation, wearing his trademark mom jeans and black turtleneck, a scruffy beard and Harry Potter glasses on his face, writers hung on his every word. He told us the iPad would be ""truly magical and revolutionary,"" and the doubters believed him. ""I went into it prepared to be very skeptical,"" Ars Technica's Jacqui Cheng told me after the event, ""but I was impressed."" That's partly because Jobs carried weight like no one else in the industry. His presentations were the rock concerts of the technology world. His ability to connect new gadgets with human wants and desires -- their ability not just to make you a productive worker but to connect you with loved ones -- took them to another level. His onstage charisma is something everyone since -- most notably Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg -- has tried to imitate, without quite the same success. That's partly because of style but also because of history. Jobs' status as a counterculture figure -- the kind of guy who loves Bob Dylan, whose company asks fans to ""think different,"" and who went on a find-yourself pilgrimage in India, where he experimented with psychedelic drugs -- puts him in a more sacred place in the public consciousness than other tie-wearing tech execs, who seem like photocopies of each other compared to someone with Jobs' rich personal history. No one videotapes the walk into a Microsoft press conference hosted by Steve Ballmer, for instance. I've been to those, too. Jobs' story is almost painfully American and it reads like a screenplay: Driven individual from humble beginnings sells Volkswagen bus to found company in his family's garage; in process, revolutionizes music, digital movies, computing and mobile tech. ""To technology freaks and geeks, he is a 'demigod', whose product launches are adulatory affairs regularly likened to religious revivalist meetings,"" the British newspaper The Guardian wrote in 2006. ""The Jobs life story -- humble birth, rise and fall, then miraculous comeback -- has even been likened by Apple fanatics to the heroic myths of Odysseus, Jason, Krishna and Christ."" Maybe all this, in part, explains why the suit-wearing analyst sitting next to me at the 2010 iPad event literally shrieked with joy when Jobs announced some details of that tablet, including a detachable keyboard he could use to file reports on the go. I don't claim to fully comprehend the pandemonium that surrounds a Steve Jobs press conference. In June 2010, about six months after the iPad event, I attended Apple's World Wide Developer Conference (known to insiders as WWDC) at San Francisco's Moscone Center. That massive glass building was cloaked in an Apple logo big enough to have its own ZIP code. Inside, the usual suspects were waiting for a chance to see Jobs unveil the latest-generation iPhone, which turned out to be the iPhone 4. I was in a pack of tech bloggers waiting behind a velvet rope, just outside the giant conference room where the event would be held. We were talking about all the latest iPhone rumors -- would it really be a game changer, etc. -- when security guards (really) lifted the velvet rope to let us in. Keep in mind there were maybe 100 writers and photographers covering this event and we were getting let in before anyone else -- to choose our seats in a room with at least 2,000 chairs. Bottom line: We were getting really good seats, no problem. Still, the moment that rope lifted, there was a mad rush. I didn't expect it at all, and almost got knocked out of the way as these laptop- and camera-toting journalists sprinted -- literally sprinted -- into the empty news conference. At the time, I thought this was completely insane. But, upon reflection, I don't condone it, but I get it. They were rushing not to hear about the iPhone 4. They wanted the best chance possible to get close to a man who's been described as the Thomas Edison of our time. A legend. A man who, in his own words, ""put a dent in the universe."" You don't get that kind of opportunity every day.","Author describes pandemonium surrounding Steve Jobs press conferences .

"Ready to rip apart that dirty restaurant with the rude service, strange-looking patty melts and lukewarm coffee? California lawmakers want to make sure you don't get in financial, or legal, trouble because of it. A state law signed this week by Gov. Jerry Brown makes Yelp reviews a lot safer, saying that restaurants can't pursue legal action for customers who give them negative reviews. The digital-age legislation appears to be the first of its kind. It addresses so-called ""disparagement clauses,"" lines included in businesses' terms of service that prohibit customers from posting negative comments about the service they received. The new law bans such clauses. It would fine any business that tries to enforce one $2,500 the first time and $5,000 every time after that, with another $10,000 added if the action is considered ""willful, intentional or reckless."" It seems like a law so ridiculous would never be needed. Sure, freedom of speech under the First Amendment lets us tell the world that we just had the worst bowl of chili in the world, right? Well, that hasn't stopped restaurants and other service-industry spots from trying to go after customers for just that. Last month, Union Street Guest House in Hudson, New York, was featured in the New York Post for trying to fine wedding parties $500 for each negative online review by a member of their parties. Hundreds of people took to Yelp to complain about the policy and write mostly fake, eviscerating reviews of the hotel. ""Trying to prevent your customers from talking about their experiences is bad policy and, in this case, likely unenforceable anyway,"" Yelp said. Overseas, a French blogger was fined the equivalent of about $3,200 after a negative review of a restaurant began surfacing prominently in Google searches.","California law bans restaurants from targeting bad reviews .

"Nirvana front man Kurt Cobain killed himself at age 27 with a shotgun, a Seattle police investigation concluded, and nothing has changed about that assessment 20 years after his death. But as the anniversary of Cobain's passing approaches early next month, rumors have stirred on social media that police might be reopening the case. They are not, they said in a statement. But they released new photos of the crime scene. The photos do not include images of Cobain's body. But the dingy, scratched images of syringes, a tainted spoon, a lighter and other personal belongings strewn across the floor will likely bring back sad memories for many fans. Immortal attachment . The attachment to the singer-songwriter, who was as much the front man of an evocative musical movement as he was of the band Nirvana, lives on. As apparently do theories of how the icon may have died. They include murder combined with rumors of personal entanglements. Some fans seem unwilling to believe that Cobain, whose name was synonymous with the movement called Grunge that transformed rock, fled into the arms of death to escape the torments of depression and drug abuse in 1994. Then news on Thursday that a cold-case detective was reviewing Cobain's file triggered a storm of digital chatter. But Mike Ciesenski was merely re-reading Cobain's materials, just in case. ""We knew with the 20th anniversary coming up and we knew there was going to be a lot of media interest,"" he said. He also watched screened documentaries and read articles on the conspiracy theories. ""I can see why people have questions,"" Ciesenski said. ""But you can always point to something and say 'what if.'"" Grungy photos . While reviewing the file, the detective, who usually searches archives for loose ends, found one -- four rolls of film taken at Cobain's house that had never been developed. Twenty years ago, police found no reason process them, since they had Polaroid snaps of the place where Cobain perished. Police had the 35 mm film developed, but the images are not new evidence. They just want to make them accessible to the public. Fear of stoking conspiracy theories kept them from doing it earlier, Ciesenski said. ""Sometimes people believe what they read—some of the disinformation from some of the books, that this was a conspiracy. That's completely inaccurate,"" he said. ""It's a suicide. This is a closed case."" Many music legends died at the same young age of 27. They include Jim Morrison, Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin. It takes many people a long time to let go of an artist who touched their hearts so strongly through their ears. Haunting voice . Cobain's voice was as innovative Nirvana's interpretation of rock and in step with it. His velvety yet scratchy vocals continue in recordings to carry social disappointment and cynical ire in flats and sharps, all energized by fast-beat, electrified rock. Just as it did then, when music fans first took note of it on Nirvana's breakthrough album ""Nevermind"" in 1991 -- with its shocking album cover of a baby swimming naked underwater after a dollar bill on a fish hook. Cobain's death ended a battle with hard drugs.  His ashes were reportedly scattered in a Washington state river and a New York Buddhist temple. Nirvana band mates Krist Novoselic and Dave Grohl eventually formed other bands. Cobain's widow, Courtney Love, stayed in the limelight with an acting career and legal problems surrounding her own drug problems. Frances Bean, the couple's daughter, has largely lived outside the public eye. What was unclear when Cobain died was whether the music Nirvana created would endure or fade away. If it does fade, it may remain immortalized in one place -- Cobain's hometown of Aberdeen, Washington. There visitors are greeted with a sign that reads -- in his honor -- ""Come As You Are.""","Conspiracy theories haunt the Nirvana front man's death nearly 20 years ago .

"The damning internal report that effectively ended Eric Shinseki's tumultuous tenure as Veteran Affairs secretary describes in the starkest terms the systemic failures of a system charged with providing medical care to America's veterans. ""Of the 216 site audit reports, many were flagged for further review because of concerns identified by the site audit team about questionable scheduling practices, signaling a systemic lack of integrity within some Veterans Health Administration facilities,"" the audit summary says. Shinseki went to the White House on Friday morning to present Obama with the audit findings. The first phase of the audit looked at scheduling and access management practices from May 12 to 16 at Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers and large community-based outpatient clinics serving at least 10,000 veterans, the audit says. That's 138 VA medical centers encompassing 216 sites -- a total of 258 separate points of access to medical care and more than 2,100 scheduling staff. An additional audit will cover all remaining VA facilities -- suggesting that the scandal could grow. ""Suspected willful misconduct will be reported promptly to the Office of Inspector General,"" the audit said. ""Where the OIG chooses not to immediately investigate, management will launch either a formal fact finding or administrative investigation. Where misconduct is confirmed, appropriate personnel actions will be pursued promptly."" Obama on Friday announced the resignation of his only Veterans Affairs secretary after meeting with Shinseki to discuss the growing scandal involving long waits for care at VA hospitals. Calls for Shinseki's resignation increased in recent days from the across the political spectrum -- Republicans and Democrats as well as veterans' advocacy groups. The problems gained prominence after CNN began reporting problems at VA facilities in November. The audit said it was ""a rapidly deployed, systemwide assessment"" of scheduling and ""not intended as a formal investigation of individual staff or managers."" The audit teams were not able to interview all employees, and ""time did not allow assessment of intent or potential culpability."" The next phase will include smaller clinic sites and anonymous Web surveys. Still, the initial findings were deemed ""a strong basis for immediate action,"" audit said. The findings included: . • Efforts to meet the needs of veterans and clinicians led to an ""overly complicated scheduling process that resulted in high potential to create confusion among scheduling clerks and front-line supervisors."" • Meeting a 14-day wait-time performance target for new appointments was ""simply not attainable given the ongoing challenge of finding sufficient provider slots to accommodate a growing demand for services. Imposing this expectation on the field before ascertaining required resources ... represent an organizational leadership failure."" • Of scheduling staff surveyed, 13% said they received instruction to enter in the ""Desired Date"" field a date different from the one requested. The survey did not determine whether this was done ""through lack of understanding or mal-intent unless it was clearly apparent."" • In some cases, ""pressures were placed on schedulers to utilize inappropriate practices in order to make Waiting Times appear more favorable. Such practices are sufficiently pervasive to require VA re-examine its entire Performance Management system and, in particular, whether current measures and targets for access are realistic or sufficient."" The VA's audit of all remaining sites is scheduled to be completed in early June. Read the VA audit report . Part of the review will be to determine how performance goals were conveyed ""across the chain of command such that some front-line, middle, and senior managers felt compelled to manipulate VA scheduling processes,"" the audit said. It added, ""The overarching environment and culture which allowed this state of practice to take root must be confronted head-on if VA is to evolve to be more capable of adjusting systems, leadership, and resources to meet the needs of Veterans and families. It must also be confronted in order to regain the trust of the Veterans VA serves."" The audit said the VA will ""ensure that managers and staff engaging in undesired practices are held accountable.""

"Turkey's main airline is banning certain shades of lipstick and nail polish among flight attendants. And the cabin crew is not happy about it. Outrage spilled into social media, sparking newspapers columns and a movement after Turkish Airlines announced the new dress code this week. The dress code calls for plain makeup in pastel colors. ""Red, dark pink and similar colors of lipstick and nail polish that are not in the current uniforms breaks up visual coherence,"" the airline statement said. Critics of the new dress code have taken to Twitter and Facebook to voice their outrage. A columnist with the nation's Daily Hurriyet urged women to send in photos of themselves in red lipstick, dubbing it the ""Red Lipstick Movement."" The airline is Turkey's national flag carrier, and though recently privatized, it is 49% government-owned. Turkey's culture wars pitting the pious Muslim elite against the old guard secularists have played out recently in a debate over the airline's policies. Many  who fear encroaching conservative values point to steps Turkish Airlines has taken in recent months, especially restricting the appearance of its female cabin crew. Last month, when photos of new uniforms being considered for the airline were leaked on social media, many criticized the more conservative trend, which featured longer hemlines and more traditional necklines. Another set of recent guidelines prohibited flight attendants from having platinum blond hair as well as certain shades of red dye. The airline also made headlines last month when it banned alcohol service on a majority of domestic flights, citing low demand.  It also stopped serving alcohol on eight international flights at the request of the host countries, it said.","Critics take to  social media to voice outrage over new dress code .

"London, England (CNN) -- The security relationship between the United States and Britain is closer than at any time since World War II, the head of the U.S. Central Command said Wednesday. Gen. David Petraeus was speaking at a conference here at the Royal United Services Institute, where he said Britain has played an ""irreplaceable"" role in Iraq, and a similar role in Afghanistan. ""It's clear that, as was the case in Iraq, the scale of the British contribution in Afghanistan is such that the coalition cannot succeed without you,"" Petraeus told the British audience. The alliance between the United States and Britain formed the ""core"" of the coalition in Iraq from the beginning, he said. The cooperation included the British SAS, or special forces, which were ""fully integrated"" into U.S. special operations teams, Petraeus said. The SAS led in a number of the most important counterterrorism operations of the war, he said. Now that the two countries have worked together for five years in Iraq and eight in Afghanistan, there is a generation of officers and enlisted service members ""for whom coalition operations are the norm,"" Petraeus said. He said the relationship should be formally incorporated into British and American organizations and procedures, with more combined assignments. ""It is one thing to deploy our people to combat zones and have them adapt to coalition operations and build effective teams, which they've shown they can do amazingly well,"" he said. ""But it's quite another thing to move beyond the ad hoc -- to instill the coalition mindset by building partnerships and personal relationships through our training and education programs before our units deploy and then to sustain them once the deployment is over.""","Iraq, Afghanistan coalitions depend on Britain-U.S. alliance, Central Command chief says .

"(CNN) -- Pop star Michael Jackson will avoid foreclosure on his Neverland Ranch property with a new loan, a Jackson insider told CNN Wednesday. Michael Jackson owes millions of dollars on his sprawling property in the Santa Ynez Valley in California. Documents show that Neverland Ranch in Los Olivos, California, is scheduled for a public auction on March 19 at Santa Barbara's downtown courthouse. But the Jackson source said that won't happen. ""Michael Jackson's ranch is not going to be auctioned off at the courthouse,"" the Jackson insider said. ""The financing is all being worked out."" ""There are plenty of lenders willing to work with him. The real estate market is very bad right now and Jackson is being affected just like many other Americans,"" the source said. The Santa Barbara County Recorder's Web site lists a ""notice of trustees sale"" by Jackson and his property lenders, Financial Title Company, filed Monday. In California, title companies typically represent lenders in foreclosure cases. A notice of trustees sale cannot be posted earlier than 90 days after a notice of default is filed. That notice is not filed unless a loan is in substantial default, sometimes six months or more past due. A real estate source inside Santa Barbara County said the trustees filing is only the first step in a long process that could drag on for months. The real estate source said other options are available to Jackson, including selling the ranch directly to another party or making a payment on his $24.5 million Neverland debt that would satisfy the trustee. The recorder's Web site also reveals there was a release of lien on Jackson on February 4, showing he paid off all or part of delinquent taxes to the state of California. ""It seems unlikely that someone would pay off back taxes, only to let the ranch go up for auction a few weeks later,"" said the real estate source. Jackson has not lived at Neverland since June 2005, after a Santa Barbara County jury found him not guilty of child molestation charges.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- President Obama lifted all restrictions Monday on the ability of individuals to visit relatives in Cuba, as well as to send them remittances. The changes in Cuban policy was unveiled before President Obama's trip to the Summit of the Americas. The move represents a significant shift in a U.S. policy that had remained largely unchanged for nearly half a century. It comes days before Obama leaves for a key meeting of hemispheric powers, the Summit of the Americas, in Trinidad and Tobago. ""President Obama has directed that a series of steps be taken to reach out to the Cuban people to support their desire to enjoy basic human rights and to freely determine their country's future,"" White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said. Obama also ordered new steps to promote the ""freer flow of information among the Cuban people and between those in Cuba and the rest of the world, as well as to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian items directly to the Cuban people,"" Gibbs added. The president took ""these steps [in part] to help bridge the gap among divided Cuban families."" Obama believes that the change in U.S. policy will ultimately help bring about a more tolerant, democratic Cuban government, noted White House Latin American policy adviser Dan Restrepo. He thinks ""that creating independence, creating space for the Cuban people to operate freely from the regime is the kind of space they need to start the process toward a more democratic Cuba,"" Restrepo said. Several key components of America's embargo on the island nation will be preserved, however. Among other things, Americans will still be barred from sending gifts or other items to high-ranking Cuban government officials and Communist Party members. Travel restrictions for Americans of non-Cuban descent will also remain in place. Critics of the change blasted the administration for unilaterally changing what had been a long-settled U.S. policy. President Raúl Castro's ""dictatorship is one of the most brutal in the world. The U.S. economic embargo must remain in place until tyranny gives way to freedom and democracy,"" Rep. Connie Mack, R-Florida, said in a written statement. Obama ""should not make any unilateral change in America's policy toward Cuba. Instead, Congress should vigorously debate these and other ideas before any substantive policy changes are implemented."" Sen. Mel Martinez, R-Florida, and a native of Cuba, had kinder words for the administration, saying, ""The announcement today is good news for Cuban families separated by the lack of freedom in Cuba."" He said that, in turn, the Cuban government should focus on improving its relationships with its citizens and the United States. ""Lowering remittance charges and allowing travel for Cuban families wishing to see relatives abroad are two steps the Cuban regime could immediately take that would show change in Havana,"" he said. Reps. Chris Smith, R-New Jersey, and Frank Wolf, R-Virginia, held a news conference last week urging Obama to refrain from easing trade embargo or travel restrictions until the Cuban government releases all ""prisoners of conscience,"" shows greater respect for freedom of religion and speech, and holds ""free and fair"" elections. ""Over the past 50 years, the Castros and their secret police have been directly responsible for killing thousands of nonviolent, courageous pro-democracy activists and for jailing and torturing tens of thousands of others. And they continue to this day to perpetrate their brutal crimes,"" Smith said. Rep. Barbara Lee, D-California, who chairs the Congressional Black Caucus, responded that it makes no sense to continue what she characterized as a failed policy.  Watch report on easing of travel restrictions » . ""Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but by any objective standard, our current policy toward Cuba just hasn't worked. Simply put, it's time to open dialogue and discussion with Cuba,"" she said in a written statement. Lee and other Congressional Black Caucus members met in Havana this month with Raúl Castro and his brother, former President Fidel Castro. Several members of Congress see broader relations with Cuba as vital to U.S. interests. A group of senators and other supporters unveiled a bill March 31 to lift the 47-year-old travel ban to Cuba. ""I think that we finally reached a new watermark here on this issue,"" said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-North Dakota, one of the bill's sponsors. Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Indiana, another sponsor of the bill, issued a draft report in February that said it was time to reconsider the economic sanctions. Lugar is the ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Sarah Stephens, director of the Cuba Travel Projects and one of the leading advocates pushing for an end to the embargo, said Monday that ""these are welcome steps, but the right course is to allow all Americans to travel to Cuba, to open up commerce and to directly engage the Cuban government in diplomacy and solving problems in both countries' interests.""  Watch report on whether Cuba is ready for U.S. tourists » . Obama ""has a historic opportunity not to be the last president of the Cold War but the first president to turn the page in U.S.-Cuba relations,"" she argued. Before he was elected president, Obama promised to lower some of the barriers in Cuban-American relations. Provisions attached to a $410 billion supplemental budget Obama signed in March also made it easier for Cuban-Americans to travel to Cuba and to send money to family members on the island. In addition, they facilitated the permitted sales of agricultural and pharmaceutical products to Cuba. The provisions loosened restrictions enacted by President George W. Bush after he came to office in 2001. Obama's moves appear to be tracking the overall public sentiment on what has historically been a hot-button political issue. Seventy-one percent of Americans think the United States should re-establish diplomatic relations with Cuba, according an April 3-5 CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll, and 64 percent think the United States should lift the travel ban to Cuba for all Americans. Sampling error for the poll was plus or minus 3 percentage points.","Restrictions lifted on travel to see relatives in Cuba, send remittances .

"Washington (CNN) -- U.S. troops based in South Korea have not been put on a heightened state of alert in the wake of that country's announcement that North Korea was behind the sinking of one of its warships in March, the Pentagon said Thursday. At a Pentagon press briefing, U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said the United States supports the findings of the investigation -- that the ship was sunk by a North Korean torpedo -- but he would not say what the United States is prepared to do, if anything, militarily. ""We are in close consultations with the South Koreans,"" Gates said. ""The attack was against one of their ships and, naturally, they will have the lead in laying out the path forward and we will be consulting with them very closely as we move ahead."" Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen said the status of the 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea has not changed because of the findings. ""They are on their normal state of readiness. They are engaged very routinely out there,"" Mullen said. ""We have a considerable number of forces stationed both on the land and sea and the forces are clearly aware of what's going on,"" he said. Though Gates and Mullen would not speculate on what the next step would be for South Korea, the United States is bound by treaty to assist that nation if it goes to war. The U.S. Army is stretched thin in two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but Gates said there are other options in the case of armed conflict on the Korean peninsula. ""We have said for a long time that if there were a problem in Korea our main arms would be the Navy and the Air Force, and those are not stretched in the same way that the ground forces are,"" he said. Earlier Thursday, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said the United States was ""in consultation with a host of different entities, including the [U.N.] Security Council ... and we're working closely with the South Koreans."" ""I think there's a lot of things on the table"" in terms of possible responses, he added. Gibbs refused to comment on any specific response. Meanwhile, the State Department said the United States will send a clear signal to North Korea that the sinking of the warship was in violation of international norms and it must pay a price. ""Provocative actions will not be tolerated and ... there will be consequences for those,"" Assistant Secretary of State P.J. Crowley told reporters. ""At the same time, we will continue to try to see what can be done ... to continue to work towards a peaceful and stable Korean Peninsula and the broader region,"" he said. Crowley said the United States has a ""range of tools available"" to respond to the incident both unilaterally and collectively with other countries, including unilateral financial sanctions and other measures. However, he said, Washington will be guided by the actions the South Korean government wants to take. Asked whether the United States would consider putting North Korea back on the State Department's list of state sponsors of terrorism, Crowley said it was unclear whether the ship incident would be considered an act of terrorism to meet the legal threshold for such a designation. The Bush administration took North Korea off the list in 2008 as part of negotiations on ending Pyongyang's nuclear program. ""This is not something that anyone would do lightly, and there is an evidentiary standard here that has to be applied,"" Crowley said. ""Terrorism normally involves ... acts of violence against innocent civilians. You know, at one level this was a torpedo fired by one military vessel at another military vessel."" Senior State Department officials said that although the department's lawyers would make the final determination, the attack is not likely to be considered a terrorist attack because North and South Korea are technically at war. They pointed to a statement issued by the White House calling the attack an ""act of aggression"" and ""a violation of the Armistice Agreement."" That 1953 agreement inaugurated an uneasy truce between the two Koreas, but no peace treaty has been signed to end the war. Additionally, the officials suggested that putting North Korea back on the terrorism list could be counterproductive because the United States was not the target of the attack.","State Dept. spokesman: U.S. has ""range of tools available"" to respond .

"If you thought golf was the stuffy reserve of mild-mannered gentlemen in polo shirts, think again. From Santa Claus outfits to leaping into jacuzzis and even smashing lettuce heads to smithereens, there's no antic too crazy for new Masters champion Bubba Watson. The 33-year-old born-again Christian's bizarre internet home videos have attracted a cult following that could change the face of golf forever. ""Wacky Watson,"" as he's come to be known, has harnessed social media in a way no golf pro has done before. The American's slapstick-style YouTube clips see him using wooden clubs to pound pumpkins and eggplants, drawing more than a million hits as of Tuesday. Similarly, Bubba's Facebook page has more than 65,000 likes, while his Twitter followers number almost half a million -- ballooning by more than 150,000 since Sunday's miraculous win at Augusta. He still has some way to go to catch Tiger Woods, who has more than two million followers on both networking websites, but it could herald a brave new social media era for golf stars -- one which experts say may open the sport's doors to a previously ignored younger generation. ""Golf has always been seen as a safe game. It's not overly flamboyant and I think it's still largely viewed as an elitist sport,"" Christian d'Ippolito, group head of international sales at UK-based social video advertising company Unruly Media, told CNN. ""The fact that there is this guy who is quite an eccentric individual -- everything from his name, his dress sense, his pink driver -- certainly sets him apart from the crowd. ""It's great because much like snooker, golf desperately needs that attention from a younger audience. And social media is an effective way of getting it. Every sport should have its personality, and football has been very good at that. I think Bubba is golf's answer to that personality."" There's no denying Bubba's intriguing character. The devout Christian tweeted ""To God be the Glory!"" in response to his Masters win and bawled on his mother's shoulder after hitting an astonishing shot from the woods onto the green to take the title. Watson, who with wife Angie adopted a son, Caleb, two weeks ago, also boasts of never having a golf lesson. Last year he left more people scratching their heads when he and fellow PGA Tour players Ben Crane, Rickie Fowler and Hunter Mahan launched boy band Golf Boys. Kitted out in nothing but a pair of overalls, Watson recorded the song ""Oh Oh Oh"" to help raise money for charity. But it's Bubba's dedication to social media which has given fans a special insight into his unconventional life. Incredibly, he replies to every single tweet, which no doubt helped to swell his legion of followers from 306,000 after his win on Sunday to more than 460,000 less than a day later. His Facebook page features albums of family vacations and home videos from fans' children practicing their best Bubba-style shots. Watson is quick to comment on every post from the public. ""He's very engaged with social media. His music video had four million views and all these things help make Bubba a likeable character,"" d'Ippolito said. ""They give him mass appeal, not like the seriousness you have with a traditional golfer."" It also helps raise his profile among sponsors. Though as d'Ippolito admitted: ""On the flipside, it does potentially make things difficult if things go wrong, as we saw with Tiger's romantic profile recently. Five years ago it was inconceivable that a sporting personality would have an entire global audience at his fingertips. It opens up a whole new debate on how much sponsors can control their stars. ""It could work both ways -- some sponsors might be put off by his level of eccentricity.""","Masters champ Bubba Watson's wacky YouTube videos are internet sensation .

"On December 10 last year a huge crowd rallied in Moscow. The people were fired up about alleged election fraud and fed up with Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. It was unprecedented in the country's post-Soviet history. Unthinkable in Putin's Russia. It inspired predictions of a Russian Winter to rival the Arab Spring. Now three months, and several huge opposition rallies later, Putin looks certain to be elected president again. So what happened? The big protests were ultimately triggered by claims that widespread cheating boosted the results for Putin's United Russia party in December's parliamentary election -- claims the Kremlin denied.  But there were other factors. Putin's announcement three months earlier that he would bump Dmitry Medvedev and seek the presidency again for himself was a key moment. It wasn't a total surprise.  Many had long suspected that Medvedev was just a seat warmer, helping the real boss work around the constitution and its limit of two consecutive presidential terms. But there was also hope Medvedev, who is considered a reformer, would find the fire in his belly to openly fight for the top job. It was a naive hope. The brazen admission of their private deal was like an open hand slap to the face -- a stinging reminder of who really has the power. Suddenly Russians were confronted with the possibility of 12 more years of Vladimir Putin's rule. Many of the people most appalled by that idea have done well under Putin. They're educated, well traveled and economically comfortable. For Russia's new middle class the authoritarian stability of the Putin years has brought prosperity. But it's no longer enough. Now they want their vote to count and they want to use it to get rid of Putin. ""The most educated, the most responsible part of Russian society has come together to deliver a single message,"" one first-time protester told me. ""The current government has no right to represent Russian society. They don't say what we want to say. They don't take actions we want to take."" So says the urban middle class. But they don't speak for the country. ""It's pure mathematics,"" says Putin's spokesperson Dimitri Peskov. ""Yes we have something like 70,000 people out there [protesting] on Sakharov Avenue but at the same time we have to keep in mind they are a minority. The majority of the population does not live here in Moscow. We have a huge country and if we look eastwards we'll see lots and lots of big cities, small towns and rural populations that still support Putin pretty well."" There's another important reason why Putin appears set to win. There's no obvious alternative. Putin's closest electoral competitor is the Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov -- a serial election loser. This would be his fourth defeat. Two other candidates, right-wing table thumper Vladimir Zhirinovsky and left-leaning Sergey Mironov have also run and lost spectacularly in the past. Billionaire businessman Mikhail Prokhorov is the only fresh face in the pack. On paper, his manifesto of democratic and economic reforms should appeal to many of Moscow's protesters. But he's struggling to shake off his reputation for being too close to the regime. Cynics call him a Kremlin project, a candidate designed to credibly attract the middle class vote without posing a genuine threat. Prokhorov's repeated denials and slick campaign have not seen his polling move beyond single figure territory. The line-up of wannabe presidents is said to be another example of what's known here as ""managed democracy"" where opposition candidates and parties are tolerated but only if they know their place. Critics describe it as the illusion of democracy. While Vladimir Putin's victory seems assured, we don't know what it will look like. Will there be more allegations of fraud? Will he win comfortably? Or will he get less than 50% of the vote and be forced into a runoff with the second place candidate? The last scenario appears increasingly unlikely but it's what leaders of the opposition movement are desperately hoping for. It would be a clear sign Putin's support is eroding as well as an opportunity to weaken him further. But however he wins, the next Russian president can expect continued public dissent. ""We want to see new elections,"" says leading opposition figure Alexei Navalny. ""Vladimir Putin won't win on March 4. He will appoint himself as tsar. He'll try to remain Russian president for the rest of his life. We need to fight and stop him from wrongly taking power. Our goal is to keep pressure on Putin."" In light of that intent, the answer to one question will sharply define Russia's immediate future: How would President Putin respond to further challenges to his authority? Vladimir Putin remains a sure bet for the presidential election. Beyond that there's only one other certainty. He'll be leader of a country that has changed dramatically in the last three months.","Russians are confronted with the possibility of 12 more years of Vladimir Putin's rule .

"Hunter Biden, Vice President Joe Biden's son, was discharged from the Navy Reserve this year after failing a drug test, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday night. Biden, who got the boot after testing positive for cocaine, served part time in the reserves in Norfolk, Va. while also working as a partner at an investment firm. Who is Hunter Biden? Hunter graduated from Georgetown University and earned a law degree from Yale. After graduation he was a member of the Jesuit Volunteer Corps Northwest. He's lesser known than his older brother, Beau Biden, now the Delaware attorney general, who served a year-long deployment in Iraq and has announced plans for a 2016 gubernatorial run in the state. Biden's son discharged from Navy after testing positive for cocaine . What did he do in the military? Hunter's membership in the American armed forces was brief: He enlisted in the Navy Reserves less than two years ago. In January 2013, the Vice President joked about his son's decision to join the military later in life. ""We have a lot of bad judgment in my family,"" Biden said. The Vice President's office has not yet released a comment about Hunter's discharge. But the announcement might not fare well for the Second Family, which touts their status as a military family in speeches and public appearances. Hunter Biden said in a statement that it was ""the honor of my life to serve in the U.S. Navy, and I deeply regret and am embarrassed that my actions led to my administrative discharge. I respect the Navy's decision. With the love and support of my family, I'm moving forward."" Does he have much experience in politics or Washington? Yes -- both in the public and private sectors. He was appointed by President Bill Clinton to serve as a director in the Department of Commerce handling ecommerce policy issues, a post he held from 1998 to 2001. From 2001 to 2008, he worked as a lawyer and federal lobbyist at a firm he co-founded. He resigned from this post when his father was asked by then-Senator Barack Obama, who at the time refused donations from lobbyists, to join his presidential ticket. Along the way, he's enjoyed stints as chairman of PARADIGM, a hedge fund agency. He also held a job as senior vice president at MBNA Corporation, the world's largest independent credit-card issuer at the time. In 2006, President George Bush nominated Hunter to serve on the Amtrak board of directors. He served a five-year term after a unanimous confirmation by the U.S. Senate. What has he been up to recently? In May 2014, Hunter signed on as a lawyer and board member of Burisma Holdings Ltd., a large Ukrainian gas production company. The appointment caused a stir, given that it occurred around the same time that his father and the White House were engaged in diplomatic missions in the region to wean Ukraine off Russian energy sources. Critics argued that Hunter's work for a country promoting Ukrainian energy independence was a blatant conflict of interest. But, the Vice President's office brushed off the controversy, insisting that Hunter is a private citizen whose actions don't represent the views of the government . That brings us to the present day. Hunter may no longer be in the Navy, but he still has his hands in public service. He's the board chairman at World Food Program USA, an organization fighting poverty and hunger, and he serves on the President's Advisory board of the Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of Washington . Hunter also has a job at his alma mater as an adjunct professor at Georgetown's School of Foreign Service. He is married and has three daughters.","Hunter Biden was discharged from the military this week after failing a drug test.

"Beijing duck, steamed dumplings or a glass of green tea: these are the culinary offerings most associated with China. But beer? Believe it or not, China is the beer-chugging capital of the world. The Chinese public gulped down 59.3 billion liters of alcohol in 2012 -- nearly double the amount quaffed in the U.S. Beer accounted for 84% of that figure, according to market research firm Euromonitor. Yet per capita, Chinese consumption was only about 35 liters annually -- less than half of the United States, according to Bloomberg -- and still has enormous room to grow. That has led to a microbrewery boom in Beijing. ""There's a whole slew of places that are about to emerge,"" said Ryan O'Neal Johnston, owner of Beijing's The Drive-Thru Bar. ""For anyone interested in anything besides lagers and Tsingtao, it's on."" Enter Carl Setzer, A 31-year old native of Cleveland, Ohio, who had barely touched alcohol until he was 25. After college, he landed in Shiyan, Hubei Province where an agency found him work at Dongfeng Motors. Setzer, an IT specialist, walked away from his lucrative career and jumped into the microbrewery business because he saw a niche. ""Never let a market that has a requirement go unsupplied,"" said Setzer, who opened Great Leap Brewing in October 2010. Last year, Great Leap grossed $225,000 with China's low operating costs cutting into only about a quarter of that figure. On a recent Saturday night, the bar's open air courtyard and small anteroom in Doujiao Hutong were standing room only as a flustered bartender struggled to keep glasses full. ""The greatest accomplishment is that people come here,"" said Setzer, who recently opened a second location on Xinzhong Street . Expats originally dominated the Beijing microbrewing scene, but that is changing. The clientele has been diversifying rapidly as more Chinese return from stints abroad and with greater levels of disposable income, according to microbrewers. The growing appeal to locals, however, may have more to do with the product itself. Great Leap infuses traditional Chinese ingredients with time-honored brewing techniques. Drinks like the ""Iron Buddha,"" blended with hints of Tieguanyin tea or the ""Cinnamon Rock Ale"" incorporating Chinese ""large bark cinnamon."" The ""Honey Ma Gold,"" Great Leaps most popular, is infused with the mouth-numbing essence of the Sichuan Peppercorn (huajiao). All sell for between 30 and 50 RMB ($4.89 -- $8.15) a glass. Success has bred competition. Chandler Jurinka opened Slowboat brewery in February 2012 with distribution to various expat friendly hotels, restaurants and bars, and followed up with the Slowboat Taproom in Dongsibatiao Hutong in December. ""I've always been someone who recognized and valued quality,"" said Jurinka, a former U.S. Army Sergeant from Washington D.C. Jurinka, 46, first came to China in 1994 as a student at the University of Nanjing and after an 11-year hiatus bounced around the Chinese start-up world before settling into his latest venture with Slowboat. Offering a more traditional selection of homebrews, Slowboat's popular brands are The Captain's Pale Ale, Jack Tar Scottish Ale and Imperial Vanilla Stout. Jurinka, too, is looking to capitalize on soaring Chinese demand. But Slowboat uses mostly imported ingredients, catering to the popular belief that foreign food products are superior to domestic. Microbrews in Beijing are more than just keeping glasses full. Great Leap and Slowboat are both based deep within traditional Beijing residential ""hutong"" neighborhoods and have paid particular attention to adapting their presence seamlessly to locals. ""Strangers in hutongs are never welcome,"" said Setzer. Great Leap maintains a strict midnight closing and even earlier hours in summer and during university exams, while Slowboat made their space (almost) completely soundproof. Both men too have married into Chinese families and are currently raising their own. Community relations is just one of the unique challenges that both face as small business owners in Beijing. Laws and regulations are often ambiguous and Setzer admitted that ""you have to make use of personal connections"" to get things done. For Slowboat, the biggest challenge came in the form of intellectual property. ""If you're not being copied then you're not relevant,"" said Jurinka, who said he required ""constant and rapid innovation"" to stay ahead of the curve. Jurinka estimated that eight to 10 new microbreweries were about to emerge. ""Sometimes they come in here and they are taking pictures of the tiles on the wall."" At the recent 2013 Beijinger Magazine Reader Bar and Club awards, it was a banner night for Great Leap which swept several categories including ""Bar of the Year,"" ""Best Local Craft Brewing"" and ""Personality of the Year,"" for the famously cantankerous Setzer. Not to be outdone, Slowboat received the ""Best New Bar"" award. Jurinka, though, said he is focused on the big picture. ""Slowboat is not in competition with any other local brewery,"" he said. ""There are 20 million people in this city and the more local Beijing breweries, the greater the likelihood that there will be a craft beer revolution in Beijing.""","China is the beer-chugging capital of the world, drinking twice as much as the U.S.

"Dropcam cameras are used to catch burglars, monitor cats and dogs and live-stream county fairs. The small, basic surveillance devices hook up to a wireless network and live stream video to phones and tablets, acting as an extra pair of eyes for the smartphone age. One person caught their dog on camera starting an apartment fire by turning on a stove. They called neighbors who saved the pyro puppy's life and doused the flames. A 17-year-old, 40 pound sulcata tortoise named Franky records his daily wanderings around the pet store where he lives with a dropcam mounted on his shell. The gadget has taken off since it launched in 2009 because it is different from typical Web cameras or security systems. It's designed to be dead simple for regular people to use. It can sense motion and sound and send alerts or e-mails when it detects someone or something moving around or making noise. Using a feature called Talkback, a person can easily talk through the camera -- say to yell at a dog to get off the couch. It even works in the dark. The videos are private and encrypted by default, but people can make a stream public. On Thursday, the company released a new version of its camera. The $199 Dropcam Pro still streams 720p video, but it has upgraded the camera's lens, added a zoom feature, and given it a wider field of view to show more of a room. (The older version is still available for $149.) The device is primarily meant as a security camera for people to monitor their homes while they are at work or traveling. A Washington couple vacationing in Idaho caught a robber ransacking their home after getting a motion alert on the Dropcam iPhone app. People are putting them in multiple rooms around their houses and taking home security into their own hands instead of depending on alarms. Traditional home security systems aren't as accessible to home owners and have limited uses outside of the bad events they catch on video. Home security is just the start. Quirky uses are part of Dropcam's DNA. ""It all really did start out with my dad trying to catch a neighbor who was letting his dog poop in his yard,"" said CEO and co-founder Greg Duffy. His tech-savvy dad tried to set up a surveillance camera to catch the mystery visitor using the IP cameras available at the time, but he ran into glitches and technical issues. Duffy decided to make a simple camera that anyone could use and watch. ""Making something really easy to use is actually much more difficult than making something complex,"" Duffy said. The timing was perfect. The recent spread of high-speed broadband and mobile devices that act as pocket-sized video viewers left an opening for a device that automatically streamed videos to Android and iOS apps. The apps are a big part of what makes the cameras so appealing. On average, iPhone and iPad users log in to watch their Dropcam streams for more than five minutes a day, according to Duffy. In a given week, 40% of all Dropcam owners use the Talkback feature. While it's free to download the app and watch the live videos, not every action can be caught live. Dropcam offers a paid service for people who want to access the last seven or 30 days of video recordings. It's turned out to be a savvy business plan. About 40% of Dropcam owners sign up for the cloud service, which costs between $10 and $30 a month. The company doesn't release sales numbers, but Duffy says its service takes in more videos than YouTube. Dropcam has big plans for the future. It's beta testing a new artificial intelligence feature that will pick up on patterns from individual streams, learning about a scene over time. Duffy also thinks cameras will play an integral part in the coming wave of connected homes. The new Dropcam Pro camera has added Bluetooth LE (low energy) support so it can connect to other smart devices in your home. It will open the door to even more creative Dropcam uses. A Dropcam could be linked to lights or used to turn on a television, or a pet with a location tag could be tracked and recorded across multiple cameras. Dropcam users will no doubt get very creative.","Dropcam is a simple surveillance camera that streams live videos .

"A California wind farm is on track to get the first-ever permit allowing it to avoid prosecution and penalties in the event of eagle deaths from farm operations. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced Thursday it expects to grant a permit to the Shiloh IV Wind Project, a 3,500-acre wind farm near Rio Vista, California, within 30 days that would allow for the deaths of five golden or bald eagles over a five-year period without the wind farm's operators being penalized. ""The permit, the first of its kind, requires the company to engage in conservation measures that protect the local population of golden eagles, while providing greater regulatory certainty for the company,"" the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said  in a statement. Shiloh, which is a subsidiary of EDF Renewable Energy, also produced what the federal service described as a conservation plan to help minimize the wind farm's impact, not only on eagles, but on bats and other migratory birds, as well. ""The Shiloh IV eagle permit sets a precedent for proactive and collaborative eagle conservation at wind farms in northern California,"" according to a statement from service director Dan Ashe. Garry George is the Renewable Energy Director for Audubon California, a state program of the National Audubon Society. He says the conditions of the permit are still unclear because the permit has not been issued yet. ""We don't like it when any bird is killed. We certainly don't like it when any eagle is killed,"" George told CNN Thursday. But the group has supported the permits as a way to work with the industry to help it minimize the number of bird deaths on wind farms. ""We think the permit process is one way to do that."" He added ""we hope it provides conservation, but we don't know if it will."" It's unclear exactly how many eagles, in addition to other birds, are killed by the powerful turbines on wind farms every year. Only a small percentage of farms actually count the birds that are killed by the power turbine blades. ""Farms aren't required to count the number of birds killed.... I've seen various numbers. I don't think we really know, but it's a lot,"" George said. Bald eagles, in particular, are protected under federal laws, even though they are no longer on the endangered species list. A wind farm could incur steep penalties in the event of eagle deaths. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service says the permits help protect wind farms from accidental eagle deaths. The Shiloh wind project, northeast of San Francisco, is expected to help California meet its goal of producing 33% of its energy from renewable sources by 2020.","The California wind farm is already in operation .

"A 28-year-old man appeared in court Monday after he became the second person to be charged with murder over the death of British soldier Lee Rigby last month on a London street. Michael Adebolajo was dressed in white, had a cast on his left arm and carried a Quran during his 10-minute appearance before Westminster Magistrate's Court. He spoke to confirm his name and that he was aware of the charges against him. But he kept interrupting the proceedings. He is also charged with attempted murder of two police officers and possession of a firearm. Adebolajo's case was referred to a higher court -- the Old Bailey in London, also known as the Central Criminal Court. He is due to have a bail hearing there within 48 hours. The other man charged with murder in the case, Michael Adebowale, 22, appeared in court last week. Police said Rigby was killed in a daylight attack a couple of hundred yards away from the Royal Artillery Barracks in the southeast London district of Woolwich on May 22. Adebolajo and Adebowale were hospitalized after the attack. Both were released from the hospital into police custody last week. Adebowale's case has also  been referred to the Old Bailey in London. The killing has sparked an intense investigation by police. They announced two other arrests in the case Friday, of men seized on suspicion of supplying illegal firearms. Authorities also moved a man arrested on the suspicion of killing Rigby from a hospital to a police station. The charges against Adebolajo follow news of an inquest into Rigby's death. The inquest opened Friday at Southwark Coroner's Court and was quickly adjourned. Detective Chief Inspector Grant Mallon, the senior investigating officer into the death, said two men were incapacitated and detained at the scene of Rigby's death. In all, 12 people have been arrested, including Adebolajo and Adebowale, in connection with the killing. • Two men, ages 42 and 46, have been taken to a south London police station. One was arrested Friday in north London and the other in east London on suspicion of supplying illegal firearms. • Six others have been freed on bail, the most recent a 50-year-old man arrested last week on suspicion of conspiracy to murder. • Two were released without charges. Separately, a man who was arrested after he spoke in an interview about Adebolajo on BBC's ""Newsnight"" has been charged with two counts of dissemination of terrorist publications and one count of encouragement of terrorism. He is Ibrahim Abdullah-Hassan, also known as Abu Nusaybah. The charges are not connected to the Rigby murder investigation, police said. The killing of Rigby, who had served as an infantryman in Afghanistan and Cyprus, shocked people across the United Kingdom. He was married and had a 2-year-old son. On Monday, the British government announced that the Prime Minister David Cameron will lead a task force to tackle extremism -- a result of the Rigby killing. The task force will monitor radicalization in religious and educational institutions and challenge ""poisonous narratives,"" the announcement said.","The hearing lasts 10 minutes .

"A man accused of killing a woman and her four children in Brooklyn pleaded not guilty to murder charges Monday, a spokeswoman for the Kings County District Attorney's Office said. Mingdong Chen, 25, is being held without bail in the Saturday stabbing spree, spokeswoman Mia Goldberg said. Chen made statements to police about his role in the deaths, New York police Chief Phillip Banks said. Chen, through an interpreter, also said he used a butcher's knife, which was retrieved from the apartment where the crime took place, Banks said. Police are still trying to understand what could have set off Chen, who had been staying with the family for about a week before the stabbings in the Sunset Park neighborhood, Officer Sophia Tassy-Mason said. ""He made very soft comments that since he's been in this country, everyone seems to be doing better than him,"" Banks said. Chen, who has no criminal record in New York City, has been charged with one count of first-degree murder and four counts of second-degree murder, as well as criminal possession of a weapon, Tassy-Mason said. Chen also allegedly assaulted an officer who processed his arrest, which added the charges of assaulting a police officer and resisting arrest, Banks said. Police identified the victims as Qiao Zhen Li, 37, whose husband is Chen's cousin; Linda Zhuo, 9; Amy Zhuo, 7; Kevin Zhuo, 5; and William Zhuo, 1. All five were stabbed in their upper bodies, police said. Three of the children died at the scene, and the other victims were pronounced dead at nearby hospitals, police said. Chen's last known address is in Chicago, and he has moved a lot since immigrating to the United States from China in 2004, Banks said. The mother of four was at home alone with her young children and Chen on Saturday when she noticed Chen acting suspiciously, Banks said. When she was unable to call her husband, who was at work, Li called her mother-in-law, who lives in China, he said. Li's mother-in-law alerted her daughter, who arrived at the home with her husband to check on the family. After banging on the door for some time, they told police Chen finally opened the door covered in blood, Banks said.","Mingdong Chen is ordered held without bail .

"In less than 48 hours, Sebastien de la Cruz has become a household name. The 11-year-old Mexican-American boy's singing of the national anthem in his mariachi outfit caused a stir during game 3 of the NBA finals in his San Antonio hometown Tuesday. On Thursday night, the Spurs decided to bring back ""El Charro de oro"" for an encore performance. Even though he was the subject of racist comments on Twitter, the San Antonio native was again wearing a mariachi outfit, according to Carlos Manzanillo, corporate communications manager at San Antonio Spurs. Manzanillo had no comment on why the Spurs decided to bring back Sebastien. Sebastien was introduced by San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro, who stressed how proud he was by his talent and composure over the past few days. Castro said Spurs coach Gregg Popovich expressed disdain for the ""idiots"" who posted the bigoted comments and described Sebastien as a ""class act"" and ""way more mature than most his age."" ""To be invited back to sing the national anthem is just amazing because now I know the San Antonio Spurs like how I sing,""  Sebastien said. ""It makes me feel like I'm doing something legendary."" Castro posted a response to the controversy on his Facebook page. ""I'm proud of our young San Antonio superstar Sebastien de la Cruz for a spectacular rendition of our national anthem at last night's Spurs game. Sebastian, don't let a few negative voices get you down. You are a true talent and you represent the best of our nation's future!"" Some might wonder if his encore rendition will attract more negative comments on social media. However,  critics might be more cautious after what happened to Andre Lacey, a firefighter whose tweet caught national attention. According to an interview with The Augusta Chronicle newspaper in Georgia, Fire Chief Chris James said the firefighter ""will be counseled for sure."" Lacey's actions were ""completely inappropriate and not acceptable"" and ""by no means are reflective of the Fire Department's attitude,"" he said. Most commenters cited on Tumblr's Public Shaming blog have either taken down their racist tweets or deleted their accounts. Facebook commenter Gabriel Gemenez said that she had mixed feelings about Sebastien's performance because of his attire. Those who were offended probably wouldn't have lashed out had he worn ""slacks or khakis and button-down shirt/polo"" instead of his mariachi outfit, Gemenez said. Although the U.S. has no true background and is made up of different ethnicities, she said, his mariachi outfit only represented Mexico and one should have a ""little taste when you're singing the national anthem."" But it seems the support for Sebastien outweighed the criticism. Actress and Texas native Eva Longoria said on Facebook, ""As a Mexican-American, I am so proud of Sebastien De La Cruz, a great symbol of what America is today! #GoSpursGo!"" Jordan Knight of New Kids on the Block showed his support for the young mariachi singer on Twitter: ""I'm sorry... But slamming a kid for wearing a mariachi outfit while singing the national anthem is close-minded and bigoted!!!!!!"" ""You can love your heritage and love your country at the same time!!! You can respect others culture as well a your own at the same time!!!"" ""El Charro de oro"" will make his way up to New York City this weekend for the second New York City Mariachi Conservatory Conference, where he will be singing in the national anthem competition.

"Are you in Cyprus? Give us your view on the deal . The financial uncertainty in Cyprus is generating images of long lines at ATM machines and anti-European Union protests. It's a far cry from the promotional images of azure waters and happy holidaymakers used to attract tourists. As debt-laden Cyprus labors to meet requirements for a 10 billion euro ($13B) rescue package, a downturn in tourism is probably the last thing it needs. Greek tourism took a hit during last year's political uncertainty there -- and the U.S. State Department website still carries a warning for U.S. citizens visiting Greece to avoid demonstrations. In a December report, Cyprus' central bank attributed a 4.1% increase in tourist arrivals in the first 10 months of 2012, in part to ""the negative geopolitical conditions in competitor Mediterranean countries."" Protests in Cyprus have so far not resulted in violence, so, in the build up to the vacation season in Europe, how will its tourism sector fare? Read more: Should I cancel my vacation to Greece?(2012) Orestis Rossides, the UK director of the Cyprus Tourism Organization, said tourism accounted for roughly 12% of Cyprus' GDP, with Britons making up about 40% of overseas visitors. Rossides pointed out that Cyprus held the EU presidency in the second part of 2012 and had a ""European tourism infrastructure."" He said ATM machines at Larnaca and Paphos international airports -- and all tourist resorts -- were working normally. ""The reports we get from several major Cyprus hotels with a good international reputation is that business is conducted as usual,"" he said. Nonetheless British travel association ABTA spokesman Sean Tipton said the crisis and ""largely inaccurate reports of ATMs running out of money"" would be impacting bookings. ""The reality for holidaymakers is that everything is running normally, though ABTA would advise taking a supply of euros plus credit cards as a safeguard,"" he said. ""Last year reports concerning Greece leaving the euro also had a short term effect on bookings but these returned strongly over the rest of the year and we would anticipate that bookings to Cyprus will also bounce back quickly."" Read more: EU bailouts a vehicle to kick the weak? UK-based tour and travel company Thomas Cook also said it had not received any reports of concern from hoteliers or guests in Cyprus. ""Our team in Cyprus have told us that ATMs are working as normal and shops and restaurants continue to accept payment cards,"" a spokesman said. ""Our recommendation to travelers is to ensure they take a mix of currency and payment cards, including pre-paid currency cards."" The UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office said ATMs, debit and credit cards could be used as normal while Cypriot banks were closed but advised ""taking sufficient euros to cover the duration of your stay, alongside appropriate security precautions against theft."" Germany's foreign office also suggested travelers consider increasing the amount of cash they carried with them. Read more: Russia bails on Cyprus . Simon Calder -- travel journalist and senior travel editor at The Independent newspaper --  said taking extra cash was the only additional precaution he'd take. ""The only currency that counts is going to be cash euros,"" he said. ""I clearly wouldn't rely on any sort of plastic. Luckily it's a very crime free place. I would not hesitate to take 500 euros out there in my wallet."" On the up side, Calder said it was likely that Cyprus would offer some great bargains in an effort to attract potentially nervous tourists. ""While the British tend to be quite stoic, other nationalities might be more concerned,"" he said. ""There are going to be some great deals particularly when the main season begins in May."" The crisis might help the island balance its economy so that it had ""more to do with tourism and less to do with international finance,"" Calder said. The end result -- particularly if Cyprus went back to its pre-euro Cypriot pound and became more affordable -- could be that the island became a better destination for travelers, he said. ""It's a fantastic destination, with lovely people and fabulous culture. From a tourist perspective it's going to be very uncomfortable for the next few days -- possibly weeks -- but in the long term I can't see anything but people continuing to go there.""

"Barack Obama and Benjamin Netanyahu haven't liked each other for years -- they just aren't bothering to hide it anymore. Long time observers of the U.S.-Israeli relationship struggle to remember when the personal chemistry between the leaders of the two countries was so bad. Even the Israeli prime minister has compared their relationship to that of a bickering ""old couple."" The latest example of their dysfunctional marriage emerged Tuesday when a senior Obama administration official was quoted calling the Israeli leader a ""chickens**t"" who doesn't match war talk with action. The unnamed official, speaking to Atlantic journalist Jeffrey Goldberg, was only saying in public what key Obama aides have been muttering privately for years. ""You have a dysfunctional relationship between Netanyahu and Obama,"" said Aaron David Miller, a former US Middle East peace negotiator. A senior official with a prominent pro-Israel policy organization in Washington said : ""These guys don't like each other, they don't pretend to like each other."" Netanyahu offered a pointed response to the Goldberg article, saying he's ""not prepared to make concessions that endanger our state."" The relationship is troubled on multiple fronts. Goldberg also reported that the Israeli leader had ""written off"" the White House, an insult to an administration that still has two years in office. And tensions flared last week when the White House denied Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon meetings with Vice President Biden and Secretary of State John Kerry. The administration tried to contain the fallout from Goldberg's story on Wednesday. Alistair Baskey, a spokesperson for the National Security Council, said Obama and Netanyahu have ""forged an effective partnership, and consult closely and frequently."" Still, irritants have long tested the alliance between Washington and the Jewish state — over peace talks, wars in Lebanon and Gaza, settlements and Israeli military action in places like Iraq and Syria. But the dislike between Netanyahu and Obama is particularly acute -- and personal. Goldberg lists a stunning string of insults he has heard officials fire off at Netanyahu over the years, including ""recalcitrant, myopic, reactionary, obtuse, blustering, pompous and 'Aspergery.'"" OPINION: U.S.-Israel quarrel doesn't point to a divorce . The Netanyahu-Obama relationship has played out in a series of awkward photo-ops, anonymous quotes in US and Israeli media and tense body language. White House officials were apoplectic in 2011 when Netanyahu lectured Obama in the Oval Office about the history of peace talks and warned him not to fall prey to ""illusions."" The same year, Obama was caught on an open mic, telling then-French president Nicolas Sarkozy: ""You're fed up with him? I have to deal with him every day."" The White House, for all its official praise for the ""unshakeable bonds"" between the U.S. and Israel, blames what it sees as Netanyahu's intransigence over Jewish settlement policy and his playing to a domestic political gallery for the collapse of John Kerry's peace drive with the Palestinians. Key officials fumed at Netanyahu's open backing for Republican Mitt Romney during Obama's re-election campaign and over what they see as interference in American politics through his strong ties to hawks in Congress. But the roots of the animosity lie deeper — in sharply differing perceptions of the threat posed by Iran — an issue coming to a head with a deadline looming for a deal between Tehran and world powers next month. For Obama, the Iranian nuclear challenge is another crisis to be managed, and a test case of his doctrine that the United States should be prepared to talk to its enemies. But people familiar with Netanyahu's worldview say he believes history has handed him the role of delivering the Jewish state from an existential threat posed by Tehran's nuclear ambitions. Israel worries that the agreement that emerges will leave Iran as a nuclear ""threshold state"" with the materials and expertise to quickly break out and build a nuclear weapon. ""I fervently hope that under your leadership that will not happen,"" Netanyahu told Obama in a White House photo-op this month. The Obama administration says the kind of 'perfect' deal envisioned by Israel, which would strip Iran of centrifuges and nuclear infrastructure is not realistic, and says its goal is to ensure that Tehran does not have a nuclear bomb. The disagreement is likely to provoke a new political showdown over Iran in Congress, where a bipartisan coalition is mulling a number of steps including further sanctions which the White House warns could scupper a deal and lead to war. While the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu deteriorates, it does not so far appear to be harming the fundamental relationship between their two nations. That has not always been the case in the past. In 1981, the Reagan administration instructed U.N. ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick to back a resolution criticizing Israel for an air attack on an Iraqi nuclear reactor. Relations became so frayed between President George H.W. Bush and the administration of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir that his secretary of state, James Baker, told lawmakers that if Israel wanted to talk peace, it should call the White House switchboard. Personal relations may be fraught now with Netanyahu, but Obama has never suggested watering down or delaying mostly military U.S. aid to Israel which amounts to $3 billion a year. Indeed, the Obama administration asked Congress for hundreds of millions of dollars in funding for the Iron Dome anti-missile system which shielded Israel from Hamas rockets during the latest Gaza war this summer.  Senior officials from both sides also say privately that the security relationship between the allies has never been better. Miller said that Obama's spats with Netanyahu will cause hurt feelings. ""But what do they amount to? It is confined and contained to a soap opera-like exchange that never leads to anything of consequence,"" he said. What this latest soap opera may amount to for the White House is an unwelcome new political row with Congress over its Israel policy — just as it is gearing up for a fight over Iran. ""When the president discusses Israel and Iran, it is sometimes hard to tell who he thinks is America's friend and who he thinks is America's enemy,"" House Speaker John Boehner said Wednesday. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said it was a bit rich to get a lecture by Boehner on ""salty language.""  He insisted that the remarks by the official about Netanyahu did not represent the view of the administration but pledged to continue to air differences with Israel on ""illegitimate"" building. That will all but ensure another bitter spat with Netanyahu soon.","The relationship between the U.S. and Israel is hitting new lows .
An Obama administration official was quoted as calling Israeli PM ""chickens--t"""
"The British soldier slain in a gruesome cleaver attack in London was a well-liked infantryman and machine gunner who served in Afghanistan and Cyprus, and then became a military recruiter and ceremonial drummer outside the royal palaces, the military said Thursday. Drummer Lee Rigby, 25, was part of the Regimental Recruiting Team in London, and as a machine gunner, he was part of the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers. The Fusiliers, an infantry group, are known for the hackle, or feather plume, in their military headdress. Rigby had a 2-year-old son, Jack, the UK Ministry of Defense said. Witness: Attackers 'were just animals' Fellow soldiers described him as having an engaging personality. He joined the army in 2006 and acquired the nickname ""Riggers"" in his platoon. ""He was a real character within the Second Fusiliers,"" Lt. Col. Jim Taylor, commanding officer of the 2nd Fusiliers, said in a statement. ""Larger than life, he was at the heart of our Corps of Drums. An experienced and talented side drummer and machine gunner, he was a true warrior and served with distinction in Afghanistan, Germany and Cyprus."" Rigby also loved soccer's Manchester United, soldiers said. ""He was one of the Battalion's great characters, always smiling and always ready to brighten the mood with his fellow Fusiliers,"" Warrant Officer Ned Miller of the 2nd Fusiliers said in a statement. ""He was easily identified whilst on parade by the huge smile on his face and how proud he was to be a member of the Drums. He would always stop for a chat just to tell me Manchester United would win the league again."" Rigby was born in Crumpsall, Manchester. After joining the army, his first post was in Cyprus as a machine gunner in Dhekelia, the military said. In 2008, he was assigned to Hounslow, West London, and became ""an integral member of the Corps of Drums throughout the Battalion's time on public duties, the highlight of which was being a part of the Household Division's Beating the Retreat -- a real honour for a line infantry Corps of Drums,"" the ministry said. London attack mirrors plot to behead Muslim soldier . In 2009, he deployed on operations ""for the first time,"" sent to Afghanistan's Helmand province, where he was a member of a fire support group at Patrol Base Woqab.

"Africa has seen some ugly divorces in recent times: Eritrea and Ethiopia, Sudan and South Sudan. Now Mali is threatened with partition as a rebellion flares in the north and political uncertainty grips the capital, Bamako. Mali's neighbors and western governments are looking on anxiously as drug traffickers and Islamist groups affiliated with al Qaeda take advantage of the vacuum -- in a region already blighted by hunger, poverty and weak government. The origins of Mali's collapse are twofold. In January, Tuareg rebels began attacking towns in the vast deserts of northern Mali. Many had recently returned from fighting for Moammar Gadhafi in Libya, bringing guns and vehicles with them. Then, on March 22, there was a coup by mid-ranking officers in Mali's army angry with corruption and the lack of resources for fighting the rebellion. A vast country of few inhabitants (15 million) and searing desert, Mali lies at an awkward intersection in Africa. To the north is a 1,200 kilometer border with Algeria, to the east Niger with its own restive Tuareg minority, to the west Mauritania. All four countries are dealing with the growing presence of Islamist groups affiliated with al Qaeda. Tuareg revolts in Mali and Niger are nothing new. Long marginalized, the pastoral and nomadic Tuareg have frequently taken up arms, sometimes with Gadhafi's backing. ""The Tuareg feel like the outsiders of the national economy, completely excluded from the economic resources in many regions,"" says Salma Belaala, a professor at Warwick University in England who studies jihad in the Sahel. This revolt, launched by the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad, or MNLA, is more serious than previous rebellions. Its fighters now control several important towns in the north, including Gao on the river Niger and the fabled city of Timbuktu, where the mayor has spoken of teenage boys strutting through the streets with AK-47s. An area the size of Texas is now beyond the government's control. The MNLA has declared independence for Azawad. Speaking to the U.N. Security Council last week, Mali envoy Omar Daou says: ""Our people are divided. Our country is threatened with partition."" The vast areas involved -- and some of the most inhospitable and scorched terrain on Earth -- make outside intervention risky. Western analysts say the plan by the Economic Community of West African States  to deploy some 3,000 troops to reclaim areas held by the rebels may just make the situation worse. The Tuareg rebels are hardened fighters. Their chief of staff, Mohammed Ag Najm, was a colonel in Libya, and several hundred other Tuareg served in Libyan uniforms. Professor Jeremy Keenan of the School of Oriental and African Studies in London says it's difficult to know how many people the MNLA has under arms and to separate its core force from hangers-on. ""But who's going to kick them out?"" he asks. ""Not the Malian army, and ECOWAS would be very unwise to try to do any more than draw a line in the sand."" The MNLA is a secular, nationalist movement opposed to al Qaeda. Its Paris representative, Moussa Ag Assarid, said last week: ""The biggest challenge now isn't the military, it is to get rid of al Qaeda. We need schools and the people don't have enough food, and that is because of al Qaeda making things unstable."" Al Qaeda? Really? Even seasoned observers of Mali and  al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb admit that it's difficult to unravel the links between Islamist extremists and Tuareg factions. But it's clear the militants are at least fellow travelers in this revolt. One Tuareg group, Ansar Dine, aims to establish an Islamic state in northern Mali and is present in several newly ""liberated"" areas. Its leader, Iyad Ag Ghaly, has called on the people of Timbuktu to wage ""jihad against those who resist Sharia""; there are unconfirmed reports that Ag Ghaly met three emirs of  al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb in Timbuktu on April 3. Accounts from Timbuktu in the last week say the black flag associated with al Qaeda has been hoisted on pickup trucks. A journalist in the city, Yayha Tandina, says Islamists who arrived in the city are demanding the imposition of Sharia law. Tandina says on Thursday that Ansar Dine ""pretty much has control of the entire city, and is attempting to destroy all signs of Christianity, shutting down bars that sell alcohol and harassing cigarette vendors."" ""What they want is to cut the hands of those who commit adultery. ... And they will no longer accept girls who are dressed in [what they call] a 'disastrous' way,"" Tandina says. Other sources say the group has attracted teenage boys to its ranks with offers of food, now in short supply in many areas. That has set off alarm bells in the country that once ruled Mali. French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe says it ""appears that this extreme Islamist-Jihadist faction is taking the upper hand among the different Tuareg factions."" But the MNLA's Ag Assarid said last week: ""It is true that Ansar Dine have the black flags, but they are not al Qaeda. They want stability on the streets. Although they want Sharia law, they are against al Qaeda, too."" Warwick University's Belaala supports that assessment. ""We can't make a systematic link between the AQIM and Tuareg. It's completely false,"" she says. Professor Keenan says there is another complicating factor, asserting that the Algerian security service is highly influential among leaders such as Ag Ghaly, with whom it has long had links, as well as with key regional leaders of al Qaeda (such as Abdelhamid abou Zaid). Keenan says he believes  the Algerians see some benefit in the ""specter"" of al Qaeda roaming the desert because it heightens their importance to the United States as a partner in counterterrorism -- even as they simultaneously lead regional efforts to co-operate against extremist groups. Algerian officials reject claims they have any links with  al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb's hierarchy, reach and its links with Tuareg factions may be as clear as a sandstorm, but it has certainly become more audacious in Mali. Intelligence sources in the region say it has makeshift camps in remote desert bordering Algeria and Mauritania. In November, it abducted three Europeans from a restaurant in Timbuktu, killing a German man who resisted. Two French geologists were kidnapped the same week.  Al Qaeda has threatened to kill all five if any rescue attempt is launched. Some Tuareg leaders and military officers claim  al Qaeda benefited from the complicity or at least negligence of the previous civilian government, with some influential politicians allegedly profiting from the extremists' connections to drug trafficking and ransoms paid to free western hostages. A stormy outlook . The Economic Community of West African States has persuaded coup leader Capt. Amadou Sanogo to transfer power (if not leave the stage), and the speaker of Mali's National Assembly, Dioncounda Traore, was sworn in as interim president on Thursday. The U.S. State Department has described the transition as ""not ideal"" but also ""a very important restoration of civilian rule."" Regional sources doubt that Traore can or wants to negotiate with the Tuareg. As he took his oath of office Thursday, he threatened ""total war"" against the rebels -- a position that appears to have the support of other west African states. ""We prefer peace, but if war is the only way out, we will wage it,"" Traore says, according to Reuters in Bamako. For now, it seems extremely unlikely that whoever is in charge in Bamako (Traore, a newly elected president or Sanogo) would implement past promises of autonomy and development for Tuareg areas, and reach an agreement with the MNLA to integrate its fighters into the army. The anti-Tuareg mood in Bamako has grown visceral; the MNLA are unlikely to give up gains for pledges so often reneged on. The nightmare scenario for Western governments is that without the rapid re-establishment of civilian rule, parts of northern Mali, southern Algeria and Mauritania could become a safe haven for al Qaeda in the same way the group has exploited power vacuums in Yemen and Somalia. For ordinary Malians, Tuareg or not, the nightmare is very different. In one of the poorest countries in Africa, many already know hunger and insecurity. Their situation has just become more precarious. Nongovernmental workers in Bamako speak of widespread looting in Gao, with aid groups and government offices targeted and food stores looted. Olivier Vandecasteele of Medecins du Monde says the group's property in Gao was ransacked and its vehicles stolen. Medecins du Monde continues to work in two northern regions through local staff, stressing its independence from the Tuareg fighters there. But Vandecasteele says that with the onset of the dry season, child malnutrition could rise sharply. And an offensive against rebel-held areas would make the group's work even more difficult. Vandecasteele estimates that the fighting has already displaced upwards of 10,000 people. His words were echoed Thursday by U.N. Human Rights Commissioner Navi Pillay, who warned that Mali ""may soon be plunged into a devastating food crisis with a risk of other shortages, including medical supplies, if the insurrections and insecurity persist.""","Mali is one of poorest nations in the world .

"(CNN) -- Area 51 has long been a topic of fascination for conspiracy theorists and paranormal enthusiasts, but newly released CIA documents officially acknowledge the site and suggest that the area served a far less remarkable purpose than many had supposed. According to these reports, which include a map of the base's location in Nevada, Area 51 was merely a testing site for the government's U-2 and OXCART aerial surveillance programs. The U-2 program conducted surveillance around the world, including over the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Area 51, about 125 miles northwest of Las Vegas, is synonymous in popular culture with government secrecy, and many have theorized that it holds the answer to one of the greatest questions plaguing mankind: Are we really alone in the universe? But the newly released documents make no mention of alien autopsy rooms or spaceship parking lots. This information will be disappointing to some, who have come to view the area as a mecca of sorts for alien encounters. For these true believers, the existence of alien spacecraft at Area 51, and the government's attempts to cover up their trace, is irrefutable and has been since reports of Unidentified Flying Objects -- or UFOs -- began to emerge from the Nevada desert in the middle part of the 20th century. The map and other documents were released in response to a Freedom of Information Act request submitted by Jeffrey T. Richelson, a senior fellow at the National Security Archives, in 2005. Richelson submitted the request as part of his continuing study of aerial surveillance programs and told CNN that he was not given an explanation of why the new documents were less redacted than previous versions declassified by the agency. He points out, however, that the location of Area 51 was not a particularly well-kept secret. Its location appears in books on aerial surveillance and is widely referenced in popular culture. In fact, the map that was released in the CIA documents mirrors the one that appears after a simple Google Maps search for ""Area 51."" Area 51 has also been referenced in government documents in the past, though this newest release is the first that acknowledges its existence and location in a purposeful way. Richelson told CNN he believes this could signal a dramatic change in the government's willingness to declassify information about the famed base, meaning even more information could come out about Area 51 in the future. The release of these reports seem to put the theories about aliens and flying saucers to rest for the time being, although they may not be enough to silence the true believers. At least they still have Roswell, right?","The CIA officially acknowledges Area 51, long a fixation for conspiracy theorists, in documents .
The area, 125 northwest of Las Vegas, was a testing ground for Cold War aerial surveillance .
Document release could be just the beginning of Area 51 information, expert says ."
"Protesters seething over their treatment by security forces hurled rocks at riot police in Ankara's Kizilay Square on Monday, the latest in a string of violent clashes that have punctuated massive anti-government demonstrations spreading across Turkey -- leaving thousands injured and at least one dead in the past two days alone. The protests united demonstrators from across the political spectrum against a common foe: security forces who unleashed tear gas and water cannons on them in response to what had been largely peaceful protests against the government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. ""There has been unprecedented violence against protesters and social protest,"" demonstrator Neslihan Ozgunes said Monday. The Turkish Medical Association claimed that at least 3,195 people had been injured in clashes Sunday and Monday. Only 26 of them were in serious or critical condition, it said. One protester, Mehmet Ayvalitas, died of his injuries, the association said. The association reported that the bulk of the injuries occurred in Istanbul, where the protests began before spreading to Ankara, Izmir, Adana and other locations. International groups including Amnesty International have criticized the police response as excessive. In Ankara Sunday night, a CNN crew witnessed authorities roughing up at least one protester. One police officer kicked a CNN videographer, CNN's Nick Paton Walsh reported, and a CNN crew in Istanbul Sunday also witnessed bloodied protesters. Erdogan responded Monday by dismissing the demonstrations as the work of ""extreme elements"" and said they would likely spark a backlash against the organizers. ""My smart citizens will recognize this, then they will give them the right lesson,"" he said. But Turkey's president, Abdullah Gul, took a somewhat more conciliatory tone Monday, saying ""the messages sent in good faith have been received."" ""When we talk about a democracy, we of course mean the expression of the will of the people in electing the leaders of the country. But democracy does not just mean elections,"" he said. ""It is natural that outside of elections if there are differing opinion, situations or objections that they be voiced. And peaceful protests are a part of that."" The protests began after plans were made to raze Gezi Park, the last green space in central Istanbul, and replace it with a replica of 19th-century Ottoman barracks. The development would contain a shopping mall. What began as a sit-in by a handful of angry residents quickly grew into a larger protest. Riot police moved in, using tear gas and pepper spray. Protesters responded by hurling bottles, setting up barricades, blocking bulldozers and burning trash in the middle of the street. Then, outraged by the behavior of security forces, demonstrators began attacking police. The protests have since morphed into larger complaints against Erdogan, whom protesters call paternalistic and authoritarian. ""This park was just the ignition of all that,"" said Yakup Efe Tuncay, a 28-year-old demonstrator who carried a Turkish flag while walking through the park Saturday. In Istanbul, the crowds have been chanting ""Tayyip resign"" -- referring to Erdogan -- and ""Shoulder to shoulder against fascism."" The protests have spread to 67 of Turkey's 81 provinces, according to the semi-official Anadolou News Agency. On Monday, a confederation of unions claiming some 240,000 members added its voice to the anti-Erdogan chorus, saying it would go on strike against what it called the ""fascism"" of Erdogan's ruling party. On Monday, Erdogan said opponents who had failed to defeat his party in elections were trying to beat it ""by other means."" ""The issue of trees in Gezi Park thing is just the trigger,"" he said. It's one of the few sentiments that all sides appear to agree on. Richard Haass, a Middle East analyst at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington, said if the flashpoint hadn't been the park, ""it would have been caused by something else. ""What you have is essentially a large group of Turks who feel alienated from this government, in power for 10 years,"" Haass told CNN. ""It's increasingly a one-party country. All the politics happen within it. The opposition is weak, divided, feckless. You have a lot of people in Turkey who feel both alienated and intimidated by the government, and this is the way they decided to push back."" A day earlier, Erdogan was praising his government's accomplishments overseeing a decade of unprecedented economic growth in Turkey, and he defended his record as a leader who has planted many trees. ""They are putting on airs, saying we massacre trees,"" he said. ""We have planted approximately 2 billion trees."" He also downplayed claims that Turkey could be on the cusp of its own ""Arab Spring"" -- the series of popular uprisings in North Africa and the Middle East that led to political upheaval in Tunisia and Egypt, particularly. ""Those in Turkey who speak of the Turkish Spring are right; the season is, in fact, spring,"" he said. ""But there are those trying to turn it into a winter."" Asli Aydintasbas, a columnist for Milliyet Newspaper, said Erdogan is the most powerful and popular politician Turkey has seen in generations. But his approach to leadership doesn't sit well with all Turks, she said. ""We have a prime minister who has done great deeds and he really has run the economy well,"" she said. ""But you also have this paternalistic style: 'I know what's good for you. I, as your father, can decide on the park, the bridge, the city and the constitution.' So, I think people are just wanting to have a more inclusive form of democracy in Turkey."" Hugh Pope, a senior Turkey analyst with the International Crisis Group, called the protests ""completely unprecedented"" and said Erdogan was caught off guard. Most demonstrators, Pope said, are ""overwhelmingly ordinary people"" who simply want their voices heard. ""However, there are other demonstrators who are somewhat more opportunistic in the left-wing factions who normally don't get much in the way of airtime in Turkey and are camped on Taksim Square,"" Pope said. ""They have outposts where they are delivering their message, and in fact it has to be said that they are sometimes on the front line of the protestors in the fights against the police at the barricades,"" he said.","Erdogan says his supporters will give protesters 'the right lesson'

"No politician in Russia can draw a crowd like Vladimir Putin. Thousands of Muscovites filled a freezing Manezhnaya Square Sunday, cheering for the former president-turned-prime-minister as he celebrated election again to the nation's highest office and delivered a patriotic speech. ""We are appealing to all people to unite for our people, for our motherland, and we will win,"" he said. ""We've had a victory! Glory to Russia!"" The 59-year-old former KGB agent and law student has dominated Russian politics for more than a decade. He served two terms as president from 2000 to 2008, then most recently served as prime minister under current President Dmitry Medvedev. In September, Medvedev called on the ruling United Russia party to endorse Putin for president once again -- and Putin, for his part, suggested Medvedev should take over the role of prime minister. In that vote, however, although United Russia held on to power it saw its number of parliamentary seats significantly decreased. The balloting sparked ongoing protests and allegations of vote-rigging directed at Putin, and fueled speculation that his sway over Russian politics might be diminishing. Putin's critics focused on attempting to end his political career. But that seems unlikely following the election of March 4. With more than two-thirds of the vote counted, Putin was leading his closest rival by an almost 4-1 margin, dashing hopes of opponents that he could receives less than 50% and be forced into a runoff vote. Putin faced four other presidential contenders, including Russia's third-richest man, New Jersey Nets owner Mikhail Prokhorov. Human rights groups say civil liberties and democratic freedoms have suffered during Putin's rule. Former world chess champion Gary Kasparov is among Putin's critics. ""I think if anybody told us in August 1991 that nine years later, the country would be run by a KGB lieutenant colonel, this person would look like a laughingstock,"" Kasparov has said. Putin, the married father of two daughters, rose from humble beginnings to become one of Russia's most powerful men. He was born in St. Petersburg (then Leningrad), the son of a factory foreman, and raised in a communal apartment shared by three families. He joined the KGB in 1975 and later was selected to attend the Red Banner Institute of Intelligence, where he learned both German and English. He was briefly assigned to counterintelligence duties in what was then East Germany before moving back to Leningrad, where he was assistant rector for international affairs at Leningrad State University. He left the KGB in 1992, and served several posts in St. Petersburg's government before accepting a job as deputy business manager for the State Property Administration in 1996, then head of the Presidential Administration and Control Department of the Presidency under Boris Yeltsin. When Yeltsin resigned in 1999, Putin -- then acting prime minister -- was appointed acting president. He was elected to the office the following year. He has received credit for consolidating post-Soviet Russia and bringing stability to the nation. He's also demonstrated a talent for self-promotion. Television viewers have seen him riding horseback without a shirt; on a motorcycle; diving; flying an aircraft; and demonstrating his judo skills (he holds a black belt). ""He's an extremely charismatic person,"" said Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. ""He's a tough guy, but he's a very balanced guy. He's a predictable guy, and he's a constructive guy."" Russia's youth back Putin in droves, singing songs praising him and even getting tattoos of his face. The pro-Putin youth group Nashi, meaning ""ours"" in Russian, was formed in 2005 by the United Russia party to promote patriotism and support for the Kremlin and for Putin. But other youth are opposed to Putin and not buying into the cult of personality. During a nearly four-hour question-and-answer session Putin held last year on state television, the Russian word for ""Botox"" was trending on Twitter, and rumors persist that Putin appears younger, possibly with medical intervention. ""One shouldn't react closely to rumors,"" Peskov said. ""The less you react to rumors, the less they appear."" Putin's campaign this time was deliberately low-key -- he sent proxies to televised debates -- but he still appears daily on state television. A primary focus of his campaign had been modernizing Russia's military, saying it's the only way to improve Russian standing and clout in the world. He's proposed spending 23 trillion rubles (about $768 billion) on the military and the defense industry over the next 10 years. While he hasn't said where the money is coming from, Putin has maintained that Russia can't afford not to spend it. Still, Putin's critics show no sign of disappearing. Andrew Wood, a former British ambassador to Moscow, said last week that he believes the Kremlin has been ""taken aback by the degree of opposition"" -- so much so, he said, that it's conceivable that a reported assassination plot targeting Putin may have been a scheme to build support for him. ""There was a similar alleged plot against him the election before last,"" said Wood, who is now a Russia expert at the London-based think tank Chatham House. ""...It's conceivable, but it seems improbable."" Wood said ahead of Sunday's vote that even if Putin won, ""it won't necessarily mean he has strong and durable support.""","Vladimir  Putin has dominated Russian politics for more than a decade .

"Germany has information that the United States might have monitored Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone, a German government spokesman said Wednesday. ""We have immediately sent a question to our American partners and have asked for immediate and wide-ranging clarification,"" spokesman Steffen Seibert said in a written statement. Both governments said that Merkel spoke about the issue with President Barack Obama during a phone call Wednesday. Obama told her that the United States ""is not monitoring and will not monitor"" her communications, White House spokesman Jay Carney said. Merkel made it clear that, if the information about the U.S. having monitored her phone were true, it would be ""completely unacceptable,"" Seibert said. ""Close friends and partners, such as Germany and the USA have been for decades, cannot have monitoring of communication of a head of government,"" Seibert said. ""This would be a grave breach of trust. Such practices have to stop immediately."" Germany and other nations expressed concerns about alleged U.S. spying after former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden leaked classified information about American surveillance programs. German news magazine Der Spiegel reported in June that classified leaks from Snowden detailed how the agency bugged EU offices in Washington and New York as well as conducting an ""electronic eavesdropping operation"" that tapped into an EU building in Brussels.

"As I sat in Dr. Valentin Fuster's exam room at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan, only one word raced through my mind: ""Whoa!""  That was it. I was floored. I really couldn't understand why this was happening to me -- and now. I had beaten obesity and, for the first time in my life, I was hitting the gym regularly and practicing portion control in my diet. I'd taken up tennis and, in fact, was actually pretty decent. This is me we're talking about --someone who'd never run for, hit or even caught a ball until I was 42. Even though I felt and looked great, I was experiencing what I now know are the classic symptoms of heart disease: frequent intense heart palpitations, light-headedness, shortness of breath and extreme fatigue. But I always thought that heart disease was an old white dude's disease.  That's what I'd seen on television anyway.  It didn't happen to newly skinny black women who had it going on. Or, at least thought they had it going on. I couldn't have been more wrong.  I was about to be the face of heart disease. When my doctors told me they were going to crack my chest open and take my heart out of my body to repair my aortic valve and remove a subaortic membrane to stave off future heart issues, it scared the crap out of me! I sincerely considered not having the surgery. But I knew I needed to be strong. So, I got focused. I became determined. And yes, at times, I was terrified. Anyone who goes through cardiac surgery and tells you they weren't scared is lying.  We're all human. Fortunately, the skill level of my physicians and the resources that were available to me left me encouraged by the prognosis for recovery.  Amazingly, even though the doctors stopped my heart for 22 minutes on the operating table, I made it through open-heart surgery without any complications. As part of my recovery, I elected to do cardiac rehab.  That was the second-best decision of my life. Three months of pushing myself to the limit with steadfast determination to recover fully was my goal. The discipline necessary to strengthen your heart after surgery is relentless and exhausting but so worth it. I was lucky.  No, more like blessed.  I came through heart disease, and today I'm a survivor. With my recovery, I realized I had an obligation that reached beyond my own health.  I made a commitment to use whatever platform I have in the public eye to raise awareness of heart disease in women. According to the American Heart Association and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, heart disease is the No. 1 killer of all Americans.  It's the No. 1 killer of African-Americans, and it's the No. 1 killer of women. So, you see, heart disease for me is personal -- very personal. For three years, I've served as the National Volunteer for the AHA and a volunteer spokeswoman for their Go Red For Women movement. The movement aims to dispel myths surrounding heart disease and raise awareness.  It's a passionate, emotional and social initiative designed to empower women to take charge of their heart health.  The goal is to harness the energy, passion and power women have to band together and, collectively, wipe out our No. 1 killer. With National Wear Red Day coming up this Friday, I'm reminded that bringing awareness to heart disease isn't about just wearing red one day a year.  It's a lifestyle.  It's about sharing your story and empowering each other to make heart health a priority starting now. I'm thankful for the voice I have when it comes to fighting this preventable disease.  I've made it my mission to do what I know how to do -- talk -- to anyone who'll listen to my story.  And, believe me, I've been coast to coast sharing my story and educating others along the way. Today, I'm living my best life in great health. I'm so proud I've spent the past 10 years getting myself in the best physical and emotional shape I could be in. I learned late in life that my health is my greatest asset and encouraging healthy living is my purpose in life.  For she who has health has hope, and she who has hope has everything.","TV personality Star Jones was diagnosed with heart disease in 2010 .

"The foiled plot to assassinate Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin just days before the presidential election is certain to strengthen his margin of victory at the polls on Sunday. Not surprisingly, the timing of the revelation -- three weeks elapsed between the key arrest in the case and its public announcement -- has fueled speculation that the whole affair was cooked up by the Putin camp as an 11th-hour surprise in order to guarantee Putin's re-election. Whether that may be the case, the reality is that even before the plot was revealed, independent projections showed Putin will win the election to become president of Russia once again. In recent weeks, American media coverage of the Russian presidential election has focused on the remarkable series of protests across Russia against the falsified parliamentary elections in December and the Putin political machine that rigged them. Russians of all political stripes bravely and peacefully gathered to demonstrate against Putin's authoritarian grip on power. To some, this may have looked like the beginning of the end of the Putin era. Yet, missing from this narrative is the irony that many Russian liberals who genuinely despise Putin would probably vote for him if they thought he might actually lose. How can this possibly be? The short answer is that at present, the alternatives to Putin are much worse for Russia and for its liberals in particular and the liberals know it. The other four presidential candidates are not along the liberal, democratic left but rather along the chauvinist, xenophobic and anti-Semitic right. Moreover, a Russia without Putin at the helm would probably be plunged into political chaos or worse. Currently, Putin alone has been able to balance the various and powerful economic and paramilitary factions. All politically observant Russians know this. Only the Communist, Gennady Zyuganov, has any chance of obtaining more than 10% of the popular vote. The remaining three candidates are long shots. There's Vladimir Zhirinovsky, himself a creature of the KGB in the late Gorbachev era who, like the talentless Zyuganov, has been running hopelessly for president for 20 years and has even tried to claim Alaska for Russia. Then there's Sergei Mironov of Just Russia who is pro-Putin and predicts a Putin victory. Finally, there's billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov, whose website was hacked and pasted with pro-Putin pronouncements just before he announced his candidacy. None of these four candidates has a plausible program for administering the country or a body of specialists capable of doing so. This political farce has been compounded by the last-minute disqualification of Grigory Yavlinsky, a liberal economist. His candidacy came into question after the Central Election Commission said he didn't have enough signatures of support for his application. No doubt Putin worried that a Yavlinsky candidacy might attract enough votes -- even if just 10% -- that together with votes for the other four candidates might have deprived him of an absolute majority in the first round of voting. This would have resulted in an embarrassing runoff election. But Putin was also concerned about the fact that as a candidate, Yavlinsky would have the legal right, which he was well prepared to exploit, to deploy election monitors throughout the country and thereby question the legitimacy of a Putin victory. Why does this matter? Those opposed to Putin can deploy about 30,000 election monitors for Sunday's election. But Russia has more than 90,000 polling stations. With three independent election monitors planned for each station in Moscow, relatively few will be left to patrol the immense space in the rest of Russia, leaving the field clear for Putin's political machine to tweak outcomes as it sees fit. Putin will thus certainly receive a handsome majority of the votes on March 4. But he's not taking any chances. In addition to the usual tactic of exerting pressure on Russia's media, in recent weeks, the government has intervened to change the board of the most important independent radio station in the country, the Moscow Echo. There is no question that Putin will win the presidency. But what will he do after he wins? How will he react to the growing signs of dissatisfaction to his rule? Is he up to the task of fundamentally reforming an authoritarian political machine that despite its accomplishments in restoring stability, a modicum of prosperity and international respect after the Gorbachev-Yeltsin years seems incapable of shaping Russia into a truly modern society? Absent real political reform, Russia will be condemned to the status of a petroleum state a la russe and consigned to the margins of the world economy and culture. Should Putin decide to broaden the base of his government and introduce meaningful elements of political accountability to public affairs, he would have to wage a titanic war against his own loyalists, who altogether control nearly half of Russia's economic assets. How Putin navigates his next presidency will ultimately determine his reputation in Russian history.","Russia is holding presidential election on March 4; Putin is expected to win .

"Facebook's purchase on Monday of the photo-sharing app Instagram had the Internet asking one question: . Will the Goliath of social networking make Instagram so uncool or so Facebook-y that it dies off entirely? Immediately after the reported $1 billion purchase was announced, some digi-pundits were already rushing to say just that -- with plenty offering advice on how Instagram users can delete their accounts and all of the photos they've uploaded with the app. Some cited Facebook-related privacy concerns. That line of thinking goes like this: Instagram, a mobile network where people share filter-altered, hipster-y photos with friends, feels small and intimate. By contrast, Facebook feels too big and tries harder to profit off of the data its users submit to the site. Here are a couple tweets to that effect: . @thisbrokenwheel: ""Well, I guess I'll be spending the evening deleting ALL of my posted photos from @Instagram. Hate Facebook's creepy privacy issues."" @sinabhfuil: ""Must delete Instagram from my phone; don't want any sneaking doorways into Facebook privacy grabs"" Will Facebook's purchase help or hurt Instagram? Share thoughts . As CNNMoney writes, Instagram hadn't monetized its app: ""Instagram is a free app and doesn't charge for any of its services. The company's founders insisted that would come in time, once they'd built a sizeable user base."" The tech blog TheNextWeb posted instructions for users to delete their entire Instagram accounts, just so Facebook can't get its hands on any data about their relationships on Instagram or on the photos they've submitted through the app. ""There is no guarantee that Facebook will be using the data gathered by Instagram but we wouldn't bet against it in a million years,"" that blog writes. Others think the app will become far less cool under Facebook's care: . @TheCBurns: ""What was once great is now crap."" ""A lot of users will stop using Instagram,"" predicted CNN iReporter Aline Alencar of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, who posted a photo protesting the Facebook takeover. And there was quite a bit of non-analytical digital freakout happening: . ""Nooooooooooooooo!"" @_VickiV wrote. Another Twitter user said the app won't die, but it will wane in popularity over time: . @jameshritz: ""For me, I won't ever delete or quit, it will just be a process of gradual abandonment (probably take a few months) ..."" Still others are waiting for more details. In a posting on his Facebook page, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Facebook will let Instagram operate as an ""independent"" entity -- albeit one that is owned by his social networking company. Instagram's 30 million-plus users still will be able to post photos to various online social networks, he said. That feature is one hallmark of Instagram, and another reason it became so popular, particularly in tech early adopter circles. With a single click, users can share photos on Twitter, Facebook, Flickr, Foursquare, Posterous and Tumblr. ""We think the fact that Instagram is connected to other services beyond Facebook is an important part of the experience,"" Zuckerberg wrote on his Facebook page. ""We plan on keeping features like the ability to post to other social networks, the ability to not share your Instagrams on Facebook if you want, and the ability to have followers and follow people separately from your friends on Facebook. ""These and many other features are important parts of the Instagram experience and we understand that. We will try to learn from Instagram's experience to build similar features into our other products. At the same time, we will try to help Instagram continue to grow by using Facebook's strong engineering team and infrastructure."" Color filters in the app also make anyone's mobile-phone photos look instantly more professional and vintage. In comments on Zuckerberg's post, plenty of Facebook users appeared to be thrilled about the integration. ""This is damn interesting!! BIG NEWS!,"" one user wrote. ""Woah...so cool! Great news for Instagramers + Facebookers :)"" another said. Here's perhaps the most compelling comment on that post, as it hints at the increased popularity Instagram could see as it joins up with a network that is expected to hit 1 billion people this year: . ""Now I don't have to explain what Instagram is to my Mom. I can just say 'It's Facebook!'"" one Facebook user wrote.","Facebook buys Instagram, the mobile photo-sharing app, for $1 billion .

"(CNN) -- A lot of travelers probably had to get out the atlas Thursday when Qatar was named host of the 2022 World Cup tournament. A little-known destination, Qatar is a small Middle-Eastern nation with a population of less than 1 million. It borders the Persian Gulf and Saudi Arabia and promises hot and humid summers. Qatar beat out bids from the United States, South Korea, Japan and Australia for the right to host the tournament. Temperatures average about 95 degrees during the summer, but have been known to reach 120 degrees -- something that, along with sandstorms, could prove uncomfortable for fans. But Qatar plans to build new stadiums and improve old ones, hoping to shield the players from the hot weather. The stadiums will include air conditioning, powered by solar panels. Qatar is developing a public bus system, and visitors can also rent a car or hire a driver. And you'll want to get around -- Qatar has plenty to see aside from the best soccer in the world. Lonely Planet suggests visiting these five places while in Qatar. Al-Corniche . A road stretching 4 miles runs along the harbor in the capital city of Doha on Qatar's eastern coast. Aside from the beautiful Indian Ocean's waterfront and the dhows (traditional sailing vessels), visitors traveling along the road, Al-Corniche, will see some of the country's most innovative modern architecture. The road has six lanes, but it is also possible to walk alongside the shoreline. Souq Waqif . One of the main commercial areas of Doha, Souq Waqif has been undergoing a major makeover. Buying and selling has been taking place on the grounds of the market for centuries, and the shops have been remodeled to look like a 19th-century souq, with mud-rendered storefronts. ""Whether its Souq Waqif, Villagio - Doha's best mall, or the wholesale markets, there is something for everyone,"" said Lindsey Wallace, a travel agent at Linara Travel, which specializes in the United Arab Emirates. Don't forget to bargain. Souq Waqif is one of the most traditional marketplaces in the city. Here, you can purchase spices, perfumes and garments, as well as handicrafts and local coffee. Al-Khor . Located up the coast from Doha, Al-Khor is a former pearl-fishing village and is much smaller than Qatar's capital city. There is a fish market in front of the harbor, and the beaches are pristine. Visitors to Al-Khor can also go birdwatching in the mangroves and gardens of the city. Bir Zekreet . On the opposite coast of Qatar, Bir Zekreet is a great beach destination for those who like camping. The city is also surrounded by desert, which is where you'll find sand dunes and desert mushrooms. Nearby are a wild deer reserve and an old movie set that looks like a deserted village. Khor al-Adaid . Surrounded by crescent-shaped sand dunes, Khor al-Adaid is known as the Inland Sea. Lonely Planet recommends spending a night there, and local tour operators organize both overnight camps and day trips. You can drive along the dunes, ride camels or sand ski in this popular desert area.","Qatar is a small Middle-Eastern nation with hot and humid summers .

"High numbers of new Ebola cases and deaths in Africa are prompting increased efforts to contain the deadly outbreak. As of July 12, the cumulative number of Ebola virus cases in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone was at 964, including 603 deaths. The death toll has almost doubled in a month's time; reported deaths in the three countries in mid-June was 350. A coordination center is being established in Conakry, Guinea, where the World Health Organization is sending epidemiologists, communications experts and other support staff. Trained volunteers are also helping officials find possible cases and isolate infected individuals. Can we stop the deadliest Ebola outbreak from spreading? The Ebola outbreak in Guinea was first reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in March. By the end of the month, UNICEF said at least 59 out of 80 people who contracted Ebola there had died. In April, the outbreak spread to Conakry, Guinea's capital, and to neighboring countries Liberia and Sierra Leone. Ebola typically kills 90% of those infected with the virus, but the death rate in this outbreak has dropped to roughly 60% thanks to early treatment. Officials believe that the Ebola outbreak has taken such a strong hold in West Africa due to the proximity of the jungle --where the virus originated -- to Conakry, which has a population of 2 million. Since symptoms don't immediately appear, the virus can easily spread as people travel around the region. Once the virus takes hold, many die in an average of 10 days as the blood fails to clot and hemorrhaging occurs. What you need to know about Ebola . The disease isn't contagious until symptoms appear. Symptoms include fever, headache and fatigue. At that point, the Ebola virus is spread via bodily fluids. The CDC says this particular outbreak is challenging to contain due to weak healthcare infrastructures and community mistrust and resistance in the affected countries. It is the first time a major outbreak of the virus has been seen in West Africa, which aids in the confusion and fear over the current situation, the WHO said on its website. I survived Ebola but villagers shunned me .","As of July 12, a total of 603 deaths from Ebola have been reported .

"Allegations of lewd acts committed by a teacher on students in a Los Angeles-area elementary school sent shockwaves across the community last year. But the outrage didn't end there. Amid a year-long police investigation involving dozens of photos showing the alleged acts, the school district -- faced with strict state rules -- could not fire the teacher. Instead, it paid him $40,000 to quit his job. Police arrested Mark Berndt, 61, in January and charged him with 23 felony counts stemming from allegations that he bound young students and then photographed them with semen-filled spoons held at their mouths and 3-inch cockroaches crawling across their faces. Investigators believe the children didn't realize that they were being victimized, thinking they were playing a game. Berndt pleaded not guilty to the charges and is being held on $23 million bail while he awaits trial, expected next year. The Los Angeles Unified School District found itself caught between protecting children and protecting the legal rights of a teacher who had been accused of -- but not formally charged with -- serious crimes against children. Under California's due process for teachers, the school district could have kept Berndt on paid administrative leave, but it would have had to engage in lengthy legal wrangling to remove him from his position. That process could have taken months, even years, and there are no exceptions for teachers accused of sex crimes against children. Outraged by the Berndt case, California state Sen. Alex Padilla drafted a bill this year that would have allowed a faster way for schools to fire teachers accused of the most heinous crimes against children. ""We were very specific to those serious and egregious crimes,"" Padilla said of the bill. ""Sex, drugs, violence involving students. These are no-brainers."" While senators overwhelmingly voted in support of Senate Bill 1530, it was met with strong opposition from the powerful California Teachers Association. The teachers' union says that Padilla's bill would have eliminated essential legal protections for teachers and that it believes the current system is an appropriate process. In the halls of the state Capitol, Assemblymember Wilmer Amina Carter veered sharply away from CNN's camera without stopping to answer questions about her refusal to cast a vote on Padilla's bill. Her aide swung a palm over the camera, saying, ""no comment."" Carter is one of 11 members of the California State Assembly Education Committee, which considered SB1530 after it passed the state Senate. The bill needed a simple majority from the committee before it could go on to the full Assembly. But the bill failed by one vote. Four members -- including Carter -- were present but abstained from the vote. ""I think it's spineless, and I think it's gutless,"" said former state Sen. Gloria Romero, who used to head the Education Committee. ""They go there to vote, not to remain silent when their name's called. That, to me, is what's disgusting,"" said Romero, who now works to reform California's educational system with Democrats for Education Reform. By refusing to vote, Romero said, the lawmakers can avoid looking bad to their constituents while keeping the campaign contributions from California's powerful education unions flowing. She said she believes the four lawmakers abstained ""out of fear and intimidation that those campaign dollars will no longer flow their way."" Those members of the Assembly's Education Committee who voted ""no"" or didn't cast a vote received more campaign contributions from teachers' unions than their fellow committee members except the chairman, according to data from Maplight, which bills itself as a nonprofit, nonpartisan research group dedicated to looking at money's influence on politics. From January 2009 to May 2012, ""teachers' unions gave 5.4 times as much (campaign contributions) to the committee members who voted 'no' versus the ones who voted 'yes,' "" said Daniel Newman, Maplight's co-founder and president. ""The people who voted 'yes' got much less money than the people who voted 'no' and voted 'no vote.' You can see how the money correlates with the vote. It shows interest groups that invest in politics buy results."" The California Teachers Association maintains that its campaign contributions to lawmakers were not the driving factor in convincing them to vote down or not vote on the measure. It described the bill as ""unnecessary legislation that would have eroded (teachers') rights during dismissal proceedings."" But Newman says it's all part of a corrupt system across the country in which lawmakers spend much of their time in office raising money for campaigns. That makes them have to bend to campaign contributions in the ""corrupt system of money-dominated politics,"" he said. ""This pattern of contribution is very similar on bill after bill, on topic after topic, whether it affects unions, banks, corporations,"" he said. ""On average, the lawmakers vote with the side that tends to give them the most money."" All but one of the four assembly members refused repeated requests for comment about why they abstained from voting on the measure.  Assemblymember Das Williams explained that he felt that ""the bill was too much of an overreach"" and he was concerned about its effect on teachers' rights. Williams said he is now working with Padilla to possibly revive the measure or create a similar measure that addresses his concerns. But it could be too little too late for the Los Angeles school district, which is facing a lawsuit filed by the mothers of the 23 children at the center of the charges against Berndt. The lawsuit, filed in July, seeks unspecified damages and school district reforms. It accuses the district of maintaining "" a practice and custom of maintaining a 'Culture of Silence' to hide teacher misconduct, and to ignore teacher misconduct.""","A California teacher was charged with lewd acts on children .

"(CNN) -- Police gunned down John Crawford, 22, in a Walmart in Beavercreek, Ohio, on August 4. Recently released surveillance video, synced with a recording of the 911 call, reveals the blatant dishonesty and falsehoods that led to his death as he talked on his cellphone in the pet aisle, casually holding a pellet gun that he had picked up from a shelf in the store. That a young black man was shot to death by police is nothing new. It was simply caught on tape this time. In the 911 call, we hear Ronald Ritchie repeatedly telling the operator that Crawford is pointing ""a gun"" at people. At one point, he tells the operator that Crawford is ""loading it right now"" and that ""he just pointed it at, like, two children."" Ritchie told the media that Crawford ""was just waving it [a gun] at children and people. .... I couldn't hear anything that he was saying. I'm thinking that he is either going to rob the place or he's there to shoot somebody else."" The man looked kind of serious, Ritchie said. ""He didn't really want to be looked at and when people did look at him, he was pointing the gun at them. He was pointing at people. Children walking by."" At no point in the surveillance video did Crawford point the air rifle at anyone. He did not ""load it."" And when police encountered Crawford, they shot him almost immediately. What happened to John Crawford has happened to many black men in the past, killed for their hands' terrifying proximity to a wallet, or a cellphone or a pocket. This, combined with prevailing racist narratives and practices, can quickly transform ""black man"" into ""armed and dangerous killer."" Ritchie dialed 911 and his statements did not reflect the truth. He's old enough to know white imagination often trumps black truth. Ritchie had plenty of time on his 911 call to tell the story accurately. John Crawford, on the other hand, had no time to think, let alone form a complete sentence in his defense. Deliberately ""making false alarms"" is a crime under Ohio law, punishable by a fine or jail sentence. But Ritchie has not been charged with anything. Even with videotaped evidence of police destroying black people, many freedom-loving Americans remain unconvinced of a systemic problem. Maybe some day the perfect tape will be released, one in which the dead or maimed African American has just the right wardrobe, complexion, size and diction to warrant empathy. For centuries, certain white civilians and members of law enforcement have used the privileged presumption of decency afforded them to cast aspersions on black people. Such aspersions are deadly for African Americans. Crawford's fate is one few white people will ever fear or experience, particularly in a brightly lit Walmart. In Ohio, it's legal to openly carry a gun, yet John Crawford was killed for openly carrying a toy. John Crawford was not in the streets. He was in one of the nation's largest toy and gun retailers. If we're in a toy and gun store, and I'm holding what could be either, isn't it at least plausible I'm a customer? If you swing by the barbecue grill section and pick up a grilling fork and lighter fluid, you don't magically become a knife-wielding arsonist. Kids grab toy guns from the shelves and act out gun fights in the aisles all the time. They are never gunned down by the guys from ""Call of Duty."" Let's be practical. We've all seen something that, at first glance, looked a little sketchy. Maybe a lady leaves her bag on the train. You could immediately yell ""Bomb!"" -- but that would be hasty and irresponsible. You could get the woman's attention, or tell other people, or notify the conductor, or call in a suspicious package. What you cannot do is call 911 and say she's strapping on bombs to kill little kids. Officers are paid to assess situations and act in the interest of the law and public safety. Being a police officer can be very dangerous. Incidentally, so can being black in America. Time and time again, when law enforcement engages African Americans, they skip the protocol and get right to the violence. If police know Crawford has a ""gun"" based on Ritchie's call, they also know he's alone and cornered. They know John Crawford can hear, as evidenced by his ongoing phone conversation. Police are really good at announcing themselves -- unseen and at a safe distance. Maybe from a few aisles away, they could have said: ""Drop the weapon, kick it toward my voice and get on the floor!"" Instead, they ran up on him unannounced, shouting and shooting like maniacs. Of course you would be as startled and terrified as John was in that incomprehensibly brief moment; suddenly under siege from big, armed, yelling, faceless figures charging and shooting him. The tape reveals a young father racked with horror, confusion and pain, as the very people sworn to protect him, snatch his life. No indictment in police shooting death of Ohio man carrying air rifle . You can't startle the hell out of an unsuspecting American who's committed no crime, then shoot him to death for being startled. Or can you? Once again, our ""justice system"" reviewed the evidence before it and determined that the shooting was justified. Historically, the justifications for similarly motivated homicides have essentially been the same: He looked at a white woman. He was running. He was wearing a hoodie. He was a teenager playing his personal music preference at a high volume. He was big. He was wounded, delirious and terrified after a car accident. He was lying face down with his hands cuffed behind his back. He fit the ""so called"" description. He was holding his wallet. She was seeking help after an accident. He was walking slowly. He was walking fast. He was walking. He was standing. There is no moral or legal justification for Crawford's death at 22. Opinion: How Walmart can help confront racism . Now, many of your experiences with police may have been associated with respect, fairness and decency. Mine have not. But that shouldn't influence our ability to interpret the evidence. We must acknowledge that for a significant portion of the American population, fairness and decency at the hands of the law, police or the courts is not the reality. This is not hyperbole. African Americans in particular have witnessed or been victim to disproportionate police violence and abuse -- sometimes to the point of death. Watching cops harass or unlawfully detain, demean, choke or taunt people is not only real for some people of color, it is routine. We're tired of being told we're seeing ghosts. If you care to look, the data is perfectly visible. And we need your help. The existence of your neighbor's pain is not dependent upon your belief in it. And we cannot improve a situation that we don't acknowledge. Learning from patterns is both basic and critical to the progress of human ""civilization."" We must stop reflexively dismissing our nation's shortcomings by telling oppressed people what America does and does not stand for. I assure you, they are well aware.","Police fatally shot John Crawford, a young black man holding an air rifle, in a Walmart .

"The quiet, sandy streets of the southern Jordanian city of Ma'an belie the pro-jihadi sentiments simmering just under the surface. Black graffiti showing the ISIS flag defaces walls and shopfronts on the main road, the backstreets where children walk to school, and roundabouts where cars packed with families speed past. One hundred and fifty miles south of the capital, Amman, Ma'an has always been known as a rebellious city in Jordan. For decades it has been at the center of repeated episodes of violent riots and confrontations with the security forces. But Ma'an is also an important city, historically a key base of tribal support for Jordan's Hashemite monarchy. In recent months, videos of small but vocal pro-ISIS demonstrations have circulated on social media, with some Ma'an residents waving the black flag of the hardline extremist group which has taken massive swaths of land in Syria and Iraq. Demonstrators brazenly called for an Islamic state and chanted anti-government slogans. The government says it has the situation in Ma'an under control, despite the apparent tensions. ""The very few Jordanians who carried ISIS flag were arrested,"" government spokesman Mohammad al-Momani told CNN on Tuesday of the demonstrations. According to a government official who spoke on condition of anonymity, ""the majority of people who showed sympathy with ISIS were arrested."" The official said a total of 71 sympathizers had been arrested over the past couple of weeks across the country. Key U.S. ally . For years Jordanians have joined the ranks of extremist groups like al-Qaeda in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and more recently in Syria. Jordan, a key U.S. ally, has been on high alert along its borders with both Iraq and Syria, beefing up security and foiling a number of infiltration attempts, according to the government. But many in the kingdom fear the threat from within is now only going to rise after Jordan joined the U.S.-led coalition in its fight against the terror group in Iraq and Syria. Like many Jordanians, the mayor of Ma'an is concerned about the repercussions of the country going on the offensive against ISIS in neighboring countries. ""The Salafi jihadi movement has been in Jordan for years, not just in Ma'an but also in other cities ... if this movement in Iraq or Syria declares a war on Jordan, they will not hesitate to carry out operations in Jordan,"" Mayor Majed al-Sharari told CNN in his office on Monday. The government downplays these concerns and insists it has the situation under control. ""All Jordanian institutions and security agencies work continuously to stop and arrest any Jordanian that carries an extremist ideology, and Jordan has a good record of facing this phenomenon and dealing with it through its judicial system and security apparatus,"" al-Momani told CNN. Grievances fuel unrest . The unnamed government official said at least 11 Jordanians were detained over allegations of being in direct contact with ISIS in Syria days before the start of the coalition's airstrikes last week. In Ma'an, the mayor insists pro-jihadist residents are not in the majority, but warns that unless the grievances of the people in his city are seriously addressed, there is potential for more unrest. ""The unrest over the years in Ma'an is caused by political reasons, the economic situation and for years this city and Ma'an Governorate has been marginalized for a long time by consecutive governments,"" he said. He said the population of more than 60,000 suffers high unemployment and poverty, and very few opportunities. Al-Momani said the government was working to address such inequalities. He said Ma'an and some other cities in Jordan ""suffer from fair distribution of development, which the government continues to play close attention to."" Hardline Islamists in Ma'an's main market area were not hard to find. One after the other, they came forward to voice support for ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State. One man said ISIS is the only solution to Ma'an's troubles. Another declared: ""We hope the mujahideen come here and enforce Islamic, Sharia law -- we want Sharia law."" Not surprisingly, most there were opposed to Jordan joining the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS. ""For almost four years our brothers in Syria have been bombed, civilians and children killed ... mosques destroyed and we haven't seen the United States, Jordan's apostate military and the infidel Arab armies move to support our brothers in Syria ... but when it came to the mujahideen, they mobilized all their armies and started striking,"" said another man. 'The Islamic State is here to stay' Some residents told CNN that heavy-handed measures by the government were behind the anger in Ma'an. But al-Momani, the government spokesman, said, ""We are talking about a small number of residents which the security agencies are after. The majority of those were already arrested. ""Ma'an is an important and dear city to all Jordanians and the government needs to ensure security in order to introduce economic development."" The spokesman disputed an assertion, raised by some Ma'an residents, of a lack of police or security forces in the city. ""There is a security and police force in the city that is there to ensure the security and safety of the city and residents, and the work continues to support the security agencies with any of their needs,"" al-Momani said. While Ma'an has been described as restive, its streets do not appear dangerous. While there is no visible police presence to speak of, there is at least one checkpoint on the road between Amman and Ma'an. Women, mostly covered, walk freely in the streets of Ma'an. Children run past in school clothes. Dogs and cats play in the street. A few minutes into any conversation, residents will insist on buying juice or soda for visitors, even offer a lunch invitation. But their famous hospitality does not mask the dark message emanating from the graffiti on the city walls. ""The Islamic State is here to stay,"" states one. Another, referring to the leader of ISIS, reads, ""Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi is our prince.""","Black graffiti showing the ISIS flag trumpets support for ISIS in the streets of Ma'an .

"Newark, New Jersey (CNN) -- Of the 84,000 chemicals on the market today -- many of which are in objects that people come into contact with every day -- only about 1 percent of them have been studied for safety, Sen. Frank Lautenberg said Tuesday. Lautenberg, D-New Jersey, told a hearing of the Senate Subcommittee on Superfund, Toxics and Environmental Health that such little oversight means that children in the United States are virtual ""guinea pigs in an uncontrolled experiment."" ""Our current law does not allow EPA [Environmental Protection Agency] scientists to draw the bright line between chemicals that are safe and those that are toxic,"" the senator said in the hearing, which was held at the University of Medicine and Dentistry in his home state. Lautenberg has introduced legislation that would require chemical manufacturers to prove the safety of their products before they're released into the market. He said the current law -- the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976 -- is too lax, resulting in the banning of five chemicals in the past 34 years. A toxic history lesson . The subcommittee is examining how chemicals that Americans are exposed to in daily life might be harming the health of children, including those developing in the womb, after a growing number of studies are finding hundreds of toxic chemicals in the bodies of mothers, and subsequently, in their babies after birth. EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson called the issue one of her main priorities. ""Everything from our cars to the cell phones we all have in our pockets are made with chemicals,"" Jackson said at the hearing. ""A child born in America today will grow up exposed to more chemicals than any other generation in our history."" Manufacturers often cite confidentiality laws in refusing to reveal safety data, Jackson said, and they say new regulations would infringe on profitability. She noted that the United States is far behind other countries, especially in Western Europe, that have already banned several substances. Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent, also addressed the hearing, relaying what he learned as he researched a CNN special called ""Toxic America."" Gupta said he was surprised to find out that only about 200 chemicals in use today have undergone testing required by the EPA. ""I'd always assumed government watchdogs had evaluated and signed off on the safety of the chemicals we encounter in our lives,"" he said. Gupta said, ""What we don't know can really hurt us. And there's a lot we don't know."" Gupta: Chemicals around us -- we must know more . CNN's ""Toxic America"" special, first broadcast in June, focused on the impact of exposure to chemicals in daily life. The first hour was ""Toxic Towns USA,"" which looked at a once-rural town in Louisiana now surrounded by chemical plants, and the second hour was ""Toxic Childhood,""  which examined chemicals in everyday life and their possible health effects. While there is no science that demonstrates a conclusive cause-and-effect relationship between chemicals children are born with and particular health problems, studies are finding associations between elevated levels of chemicals in a baby's body and their development. ""Babies in this country are born 'pre-polluted,' "" Gupta said. Other witnesses in Tuesday's hearing were Lisa Huguenin, a New Jersey mother of a child with autism and an immune system disorder; Dr. Steven Marcus, executive and medical director of the New Jersey Poison Information and Education System; and Dr. Frederica Perera, director of the Columbia Center for Children's Environmental Health. Perera's center has been following hundreds of pregnant women over the past 12 years to measure chemicals entering the womb during pregnancy. The women trudge through New York City for 48 hours wearing special backpacks, each with a long tube that is slung over the shoulder. The tube, resting inches below the pregnant mom's mouth, sucks air into a special filter, giving an approximate measurement of the air that she is breathing. The backpack is designed to measure ambient toxics spewed by vehicles and pesticides, along with chemicals from common household products. ""It surprised me when we analyzed the air samples [from the backpacks] and found 100 percent of them had detectable levels of at least one pesticide and the air pollutants we were interested in,"" Perera, who also is a professor at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, told CNN earlier this year. ""Every single one."" Scientist taught world to get the lead out . So far, the toxics measured in the backpacks match what scientists are finding in the cord blood of the babies once they are born. Small studies by other groups also are finding common household chemicals in babies. ""We've measured hundreds and hundreds of toxic chemicals in the blood of babies that are still in the womb,"" said Ken Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit environmental advocacy organization. ""Flame retardants, the chemicals in consumer products like personal care products, makeup, shampoos. It's a very long list."" The organization's study found an average of 232 chemicals in the cord blood of 10 babies born in late 2009. They are chemicals found in a wide array of common household products, including shampoos and conditioners, cosmetics, plastics, shower curtains, mattresses and electronics such as computers and cell phones. Perera and her colleagues are following the children in their study from the uterus, through birth, and up to their first several years of life. They recently published a study in the journal Pediatrics demonstrating an association between the chemicals they found in babies' cord blood and later problems on intelligence tests and development. ""Fifteen percent of children [in our study] have at least one developmental problem,"" Perera said. The amount of chemicals measured in the cord blood of the babies seems to matter. The higher the concentration, the more the IQ among children seems to dip. The study is also being conducted among pregnant women in Poland and China, and finding similar results.

"Taksim Square is Istanbul's equivalent to Cairo's Tahrir Square or London's Trafalgar Square and it is now the epicenter of demonstrations triggered by construction plans for a shopping center in one of the city's few remaining green spaces. What was initially a small sit-in has morphed into a major series of protests due to -- in the words of Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan -- ""excessive force"" by the police. LATEST: Thousands of protesters tear-gassed in Ankara . These protests reflect, in part, the deep ideological polarization between secular, liberal-minded Turks, and the more religious Turks, representing a quarter and two-thirds of the population respectively based on the 2011 general election results. Many secular Turks complainthat the Islamist-rooted government is intolerant of criticism and the diversity of lifestyles. So far, Erdogan's robust and muscular stance vis-à-vis the demonstrators has reinforced those perceptions. A typical example cited by detractors is the government's recent enactment of tight restrictions on the sale and promotion of alcohol even though the Turkish government's Household Budget Surveys estimates that only 6 percent of Turkish households are alcohol drinkers. Less than 1.5 percent of car accidents in 2012 were alcohol-related according to Turkish economist Emre Deliveli . Despite economic boom, Erdogan targeted by protests . At the same time, critics are unhappy at the rapid pace of urbanization in Turkey's metropolitan cities. Erdogan is planning to build a third airport, a third Bosphorus bridge and a canal linking the Black Sea with the Sea of Marmara, which are likely to destroy millions of trees and a delicate ecosystem in northern Istanbul. A staggering $4.7 billion was spent on ambitious construction projects last year in Istanbul alone. Given the litany of grievances and the confrontational nature of Turkish politics, the raging protests come as no surprise. They coincide with a rapidly slowing economy that is likely to witness moderate growth rates at best for the foreseeable future without increased structural reforms. Unfortunately, the Turkish government is not expected to undertake major reform initiatives anytime soon, especially since the campaigning for the local and presidential elections in 2014 and the parliamentary elections in 2015 are already underway. Despite the rising emotions sweeping Turkey, this is not equivalent to the ""Arab Spring"" that led to the toppling of former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Unlike Egypt and other Arab countries, Turkey is a functioning, albeit incomplete, democracy and has been since 1950. Erdogan received a resounding mandate of almost half the vote in the last general elections in 2011. He still remains the most popular politician in Turkey, while the opposition is widely seen by many Turks as weak and ineffective. Undoubtedly, the global media coverage of the riots and the disproportionate security response has dented the international image of Erdogan and the governing Justice and Development Party as a progressive force in Turkey's political scene. Nevertheless, the ultimate determinant of Erdogan's staying power will be the state of the Turkish economy rather than anti-government demonstrations.

"The girls strutting down the runway in The Savoy Hotel share many features - all are long-limbed, fine-boned and have glowing complexions. A silent army marching to the heavy music, past the front row A-listers peering out from behind their dark glasses. But one girl is different: the only one with black skin in a battalion of white faces. Nadja is one of the few black models lucky enough to make this year's cut for London Fashion Week. The lack of racial diversity in the fashion industry is a serious issue that needs to be tackled, according to supermodels Naomi Campbell and Iman, who this month launched a campaign to raise awareness of racism in the industry. ""The absence of people of color on the runways and photography reinforces to our young girls that they're not beautiful enough, that they're not acceptable enough,"" said Iman, model and wife of David Bowie, to CNN. ""The diversity that we live in, the world that we live in, is not what is shown on the runway. That to me is the concern. It's a bigger issue at large than just about runway and models."" Campbell and Iman, in a campaign spearheaded by former model agent Bethann Hardison, have written to the major fashion councils of New York, London, Milan and Paris calling for an end to racism. The ""Diversity Coalition,"" as the trio has named itself, identifies the fashion houses which ""consistently use one or no models of color"" in their runway shows - including Marc Jacobs, Victoria Beckham, Calvin Klein, Donna Karan and Rodarte. ""No matter the intention,"" their letter says, ""the result is racism."" CNN reached out to each of those companies for comment, but has received no response. Casting the 'imperfect model' at Fashion Week . Runways getting whiter . Campbell says the situation for black models has become worse - not better - since her debut. ""When I started modeling in '86 there was Asians, blacks, whites, Indians, Chinese. It was very diverse,"" Campbell told CNN. ""It's not like that today. It's heart-breaking to me that we're in 2013 and we're sitting here talking about this. But it has to be done and people need to know."" The numbers speak for themselves. At New York Fashion week in February, only 6% of designs were shown on black models, according to statistics compiled by blog Jezebel. The vast majority of runway spots (82.7%) went to white models, with a growing proportion of Asian girls (9.1%). In London, renowned model agent Carole White, who managed Campbell's career for 17 years, says designers here also tend towards white models for their shows. ""I think clients have this perception that black girls do not sell products, which goes way back to the 50's. I think it's engrained in every magazine editor. There are more products for blonde and blue-eyed girls. Everything is geared to that."" White has only 13 black models on her books, out of the 300 or so girls she manages. She says the bar is set much higher for black models and they have to be flawless to get booked, so she cannot afford to take them on. ""We're more discerning about the type of black girl we take, because we know they have to be stunningly beautiful, have an incredible body. "" ""They have to be actually perfect"" she says, whereas white girls, can be more quirky-looking. Race and fashion: Still an issue? Token diversity . Back at The Savoy Hotel, Nadja is walking for Temperley London as one of only three non-white models in the cast. She feels lucky to get work, but says it's harder for black models compared to their white peers. ""When I come to a show the hairdressers are not really ready for a black girl, for black hair. The makeup artists, they don't know how to do black skin. I can feel it sometimes - to be a black girl it's a bit tougher than for a white girl or a European girl."" Nadja says she sometimes feels like the token black girl in a show. ""I would love to be booked for shows ... because I am me - for my personality, for the person, for the model I am and not because I will be the only black girl for the show."" This tokenistic attitude towards diversity is something Campbell, Iman and Hardison are trying to tackle. But designers complain that they don't have enough good black models to choose from. ""There are not enough models coming to castings that are black,"" designer Alice Temperley told CNN. ""That's basically not having the choice."" Lasting change . Iman also criticizes casting directors and stylists for their part in providing too few black models to designers. She says it's an attitude that has to change. ""I don't want to ever hear again a young model telling me that [casting directors] have said to her: 'We are not seeing black models this season.' To me that's offensive. To me that's a racist remark."" The Diversity Coalition hopes that by getting the conversation started and raising awareness of the lack of black models, they will force out discrimination from all corners of the industry. Campbell says they'll keep speaking out until they see real change that lasts from season to season. ""We don't want this to be a trend. We want this to last.""

"(CNN) -- U.S. President Barack Obama's secret weapon in China? Michelle. Forget diplomatic meetings. It seems the quickest way to a country's heart is by skipping rope in the playground, giggling with high school students, and trying your hand at everything from tai chi to table tennis -- even if you sometimes look a bit silly in the process. But hey, at least she's enjoying herself right? And in a country where it's rare to see leaders' spouses or children in public, Mrs Obama seems to have charmed its citizens with her approachable manner -- and snappy style. As her week-long trip promoting educational exchange wraps up, here are five reasons why the U.S. First Lady absolutely nailed it. 1. She's got sound advice. Michelle Obama had some words of wisdom for young American students traveling abroad for the first time: ""You're probably going to make a lot of mistakes. But you know what? That's life. And other parts of the world will appreciate your effort and your energy, as long as you come into the experience respecting the people and the culture,"" she told CNN's iReport. 2. She took her 76-year-old mom, Marian Robinson. And her daughters, Malia, 15, and Sasha, 12. That's three generations of women, which makes a nice change from the usual line up of male delegates. A little background for you: Robinson is the White House's first live-in grandmother since the 1950s, earning the nickname ""First Granny."" 3. She's down with the kids. From skipping rope in the playground, to throwing some interesting tai chi shapes, and kicking a jianzi (that's a weighted shuttlecock to the rest of us), it seems there's not much Obama won't try. And she genuinely seems to enjoy it. 4. She's a cyber champion. Access to information -- including the internet -- should be a universal right, declared Obama during a speech at Peking University's Stanford Center. It's quite a ballsy statement, considering China's ""Firewall"" blocks all websites deemed sensitive. But the U.S. First Lady trod a fine line, stopping short of directly criticizing her hosts. 5. She's such a charmer. Barack who? Mrs Obama proved she can hold her own on an international tour, charming people with her warm and open style.

Brazil got their Olympics started with a 3-2 win over Egypt in Cardiff, whilst Team GB, playing their first Olympic football tournament since 1960, began with a 1-1 draw with Senegal. In the afternoon kick off, Spain fell to a goal from Yuki Otsu, who found the net in the 33rd minute, thumping the ball home from a corner. Things got worse for Luis Milla's Spain side as Real Sociedad defender Inigo Martinez was shown a red card minutes before half time. Spain's Olympic squad has been expected to add Olympic gold to the country's already impressive collection of titles. The Spanish team recently won its second consecutive European Championship, to add to the 2010 World Cup won in South Africa. Spain also hold the European under 19 and under 21 titles. The European champions enjoyed more of the ball throughout the 90 minutes but they struggled to deal with the pace of Japan's attacks, with David De Gea, Manchester United's young goalkeeper, keeping his country in contention with several fine saves. Japan, who upset the odds when they beat favorites Brazil at the 1996 Atlanta Games, could have extended their lead as Spain chased a goal, but Nagai and Hotaru Yamaguchi both failed to convert easy chances. Brazil demonstrated why many feel they are the team to challenge Spain for the gold medal, with an explosive opening 26 minutes that saw the South American side take a 3-0 lead against Egypt. The much lauded Neymar drove a fluid attacking performance. It was Neymar, who still plays in Brazil despite repeatedly being linked with some of Europe's biggest clubs, that provided a perfect pass for full back Rafael to open the scoring, before in the 16th minute, providing a low cross that invited Leandro Damiao to double the lead. With 26 minutes gone the 20 year old surged through the Egypt defence before exchanging passes with Hulk, on the left wing, and burying the ball past goalkeeper Ahmed Elshenawi. The five time World champions struggled to continue their dominance in the second half, with Egypt captain Mohamed Aboutrika pulling a goal back in the 52nd minute. Mohamed Salah increased the pressure on Brazil, who are seeking to win their first Olympic football gold medal, with his goal 14 minutes from the end, but Egypt couldn't find an equalizer. Brazil vs. Spain - who will win Olympic gold? In the evening's other Group C game, Belarus enjoyed a 1-0 victory over New Zealand, with Dmitry Baga scoring the winning goal. New Zealand goalkeeper Michael O'Keefe failed to clear a corner on the stroke of half time, and Baga was left with a simple header to give his side the lead. The reformed Great Britain side, who haven't competed in the Olympic football competition since 1960, made a steady, if uninspiring, Olympic return at Old Trafford, Manchester. Craig Bellamy opened the scoring for the host nation in the 20th minute, but Stuart Pearce's team couldn't find a second goal. With eight minutes to go, Senegal striker Moussa Konate pulled his side level with a goal against the run of play. Senegal broke quickly after intercepting a poor Great Britain corner, and Konate did well to reach a through ball from Pepe Souare and chip it over the onrushing Britain goalkeeper. Current South American champions Uruguay got their Olympics off to a good start with a 2-1 win over the United Arab Emirates. UAE took a surprise lead when captain Ismael Matar took the ball around Uruguay goalkeeper Matin Campana and slotted it into the bottom corner. Uruguay talisman Luis Suarez dragged his side back into the tie, with a key role in both Gaston Ramirez's equalizer and Nicola Lodeiro's winner. Uruguay's three points sees them top Group A, with Great Britain and Senegal following with a point a piece. Earlier in the day, Spain's group rivals Honduras and Morocco got the men's tournament underway with a 2-2 draw. the result ensured Spain are bottom of the group after the first round of matches. Abdelaziz Barrad opened the scoring for Morrocco, before Honduran forward Jerry Bengtson equalized with a close range tap in. Bengtson, who plays for New England Revolution in the U.S., then put his side ahead with a 65th minute penalty. The lead only lasted two minutes though, Zakaria Labyad chipping the ball over Honduras goalkeepr Jose Mendoza in the 67th minute. Moments later Morocco's Zakarya Bergdich was sent off for kicking out at Mario Martinez, but the African side managed to hold on for a point. Mexico and South Korea got Group B underway with a goalless draw at St. James' Park, Newcastle. Substitute Raul Jimenez struck the post for Mexico in injury time, while South Korea captain Jacheol Koo went close with a glancing header. It was a disappointing game between two sides with genuine hopes of making it to the knockout stages. In the other Group B game, Gabon and Switzerland tied 1-1 after Pierre Aubameyang saved a point for the African side after Admir Mehmedi gave the Swiss side the lead with a fifth minute penalty.","Japan stun Spain with 1-0 victory .

"Protesters hurled rocks and police fired tear gas in Istanbul on Sunday, the third day of demonstrations. Thousands of protesters remained in control of the city's Taksim Square after security forces abandoned the district Saturday following 36 hours of vicious clashes and angry demonstrations against the government. Demonstrators erected makeshift barricades at the entrance to the square, which holds huge symbolic importance for Turkey's leftist political parties and labor movement. There were reports of confrontations in at least one other neighborhood in Istanbul and in cities such as Ankara and Adana, where a man told CNN the situation was bad. Police fired tear gas in Ankara to disperse demonstrators. ""There is civil police arresting people all over the place,"" Cenker Kardesler said by phone. ""The police tried to corner the people. They came at us from both sides."" In Taksim Square, tensions remained high between protesters and police, but the scene was calmer than it had been in recent days. Many people helped municipal workers in their cleanup efforts. But on Friday and Saturday, this bustling neighborhood was a battleground as riot police used water cannons, tear gas, pepper spray and armored personnel carriers to prevent protesters from entering this transit and commercial hub at the heart of the city. Saturday afternoon, police withdrew after firing several last volleys of tear gas at crowds, sending thousands of screaming people fleeing for cover. Police used similar tactics in the Istanbul neighborhood of Besiktas early Sunday, a resident said. A woman who was on her way to buy groceries told CNN she saw police using tear gas and people fleeing in terror. Police crackdown triggers anti-government riots . Turkey's semi-official news agency reported that more than 700 people have been detained since Tuesday, and most have been released. Andalou News Agency said 58 civilians are still hospitalized and 115 security officers have been injured. There have been protests in 67 of Turkey's 81 provinces over the past four days, Andalou reported. What began as a small sit-in to protest against the government's plan to demolish a park in Taksim Square has swelled to the biggest protest movement against Turkey's prime minister since Recep Tayyip Erdogan was elected more than 10 years ago.  The crowds have been chanting ""Tayyip resign"" and ""shoulder to shoulder against fascism."" In a televised speech on Sunday, Erdogan remained defiant. ""I ask in the name of God, Tayyip Erdogan is a dictator?  If you are the kind of person who can call someone who serves their people a dictator, then I have no words for you,"" Erdogan said. He went on to praise his accomplishments overseeing a decade of unprecedented economic growth in Turkey.  He also defended his record as a leader who has planted many trees. Court to hear case at center of Istanbul protests . ""They are putting on airs saying we massacre trees,"" he said.  ""We have planted approximately 2 billion trees."" But many of the demonstrators say their anger is no longer directed against the proposed government plan to demolish Gezi Park, the last green space in central Istanbul. ""This park was just the ignition of all that,"" said Yakup Efe Tuncay, a 28-year-old demonstrator who carried a Turkish flag while walking through the park Saturday. ""The Erdogan government is usually considered as authoritarian.  He has a big ego; he has this Napoleon syndrome. He takes himself as a sultan. ... He needs to stop doing that. He's just a prime minister."" The scope of the protests shows there is a bigger issue, about freedom of speech and accusations of authoritative government. ""People are entitled to disagreement with the government; they can exercise their democratic rights, but they can do so within the context of a democratic society,"" Erdogan's chief adviser, Ibrahim Kalin, said Saturday. International human rights groups Amnesty International and Greenpeace have denounced what they describe as the excessive use of police force against peaceful protesters. A spokesman for European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton issued a statement that said Ashton ""regrets disproportionate use of force by members of the Turkish police."" Ashton also called for talks between the two sides.","Police fire tear gas in Istanbul and Ankara .

"A FedEx package handler went on a shooting rampage early Tuesday at his workplace in suburban Atlanta, wounding six people before turning the gun on himself, officials said. ""That individual is deceased here at the scene,"" Cobb County Police Sgt. Dana Pierce told reporters. Police were sweeping the area with search dogs to ensure no secondary devices had been planted. Authorities identified 19-year-old Geddy L. Kramer of Acworth as the shooter. His body was found near a shotgun, Pierce said. ""That was the only weapon that he had at that time,"" Pierce said. The warehouse is located in Kennesaw, Georgia, about 21 miles northwest of downtown Atlanta. ""Numerous"" 911 calls from inside the half-million-square-foot package and delivery facility alerted police to the shooting at 5:54 a.m., Pierce said. The victims were taken to WellStar Kennestone Hospital, where an emergency room doctor involved in the response said three were in critical condition. EMS officials warned the hospital at 6:26 a.m. to prepare for the victims' arrival, Dr. Michael Nitzken said. By 7 a.m., the six patients -- all of whom had suffered multiple gunshot wounds -- had arrived. Without naming them, Nitzken identified them as: . -- a 28-year-old man in critical condition after undergoing surgery; . -- a 52-year-old woman in stable condition after undergoing surgery; . -- a 22-year-old man in stable condition; . -- a 38-year-old man in stable condition; . -- a 42-year-old woman who was treated and released; . -- a 19-year-old man who was treated and was to be released. Two of the patients -- the 28-year-old man and the 52-year-old woman -- suffered life-threatening injuries and the man was placed on mechanical ventilation, he said. ""They appeared to be shotgun blast effects, with multiple, small projectiles,"" Nitzken said. Their arrival at the level-two trauma center coincided with a shift change. ""That proved to be to our benefit,"" the doctor said, because the staff was double what it typically would be. ""We're trying to make the best of a bad outcome."" FedEx spokesman Scott Fielder told CNN that the situation had stabilized ""and we are focused on the needs of our team members and cooperating with the law enforcement investigation of this tragedy.""","Shooter has been identified as 19-year-old Geddy L.

"Two French aviation design studios are betting on gambling in the air. Jean-Pierre Alfano of AirJet Designs and Frédérique Houssard, the founder of Designescence, have teamed up to create the Casino Jet Lounge, a luxe bar-cum-casino they hope will one day become standard on long-haul commercial flights. The Casino Jet Lounge features trendy seating, a drinks area and a blackjack table. ""We're trying to bring back the glamor of the '50s and '60s a little bit; the kind you see in the James Bond movies,"" says Houssard. The concept is relatively new (launched last October), so as of now, Houssard and Alfano are still in talks with various airlines. The idea of in-flight gambling may seem like a new one, principally because no airline is currently doing it. But in reality, the concept has been around for decades. Singapore Airlines took gambling up in the air in 1981, when they installed lightweight slot machines in the aisles on a flight that operated between Singapore and San Francisco. It was an experiment that lasted a mere two months. The company admits the machines posed ""an operational challenge"", and had them removed. See also: In-flight internet taking off . In the 1990s, Swissair installed gambling software that allowed passengers to bet up to $350 on a variety of casino classics, including poker, keno and blackjack. It seemed other carriers were going to follow suit, that is, until a Swissair plane crashed in 1998. Air crash investigators implicated a failure of the jet's in-flight entertainment system as a reason for the disaster. However, the idea of in-flight gambling re-emerged a few years ago. Virgin Atlantic Airways tycoon Richard Branson announced in 2005 that a handful of recently purchased A380 planes would include double beds and in-flight casinos. ""You'll have two ways to get lucky on a Virgin flight,"" he joked with The New York Times. The company seems to have backtracked since then. ""Casinos were just an idea, along with many other ideas we talked about a few years ago,"" a Virgin spokesman told CNN. ""Truthfully, we did not really get any further with it."" They declined to comment as to why they didn't ultimately implement casinos on their A380s. Ryanair announced in 2004 that it would introduce gambling through an in-flight entertainment system, though this too has yet to come to fruition. Ryanair's head of communications, Stephen McNamara, said the company still hopes to do so in the future. ""We don't have the technology in place at the moment, but hopefully we will in the next two or three years,"" he says. ""Really, the reason we don't currently is based on the expense of the Wi-Fi technology that would be required for it. We're waiting for the price to come down."" See also: Ryanair considers serving in-flight porn . Aside from the initial investment, there are several other barriers to introducing casinos on airplanes. For starters, as more carriers are unrolling Wi-Fi on their flights, passengers could feasibly just gamble online from their mobile devices. One wonders if this wouldn't defeat the purpose of airlines investing in their own gaming systems. McNamara says that Ryanair plans to combat the issue by ultimately offering ""closed loop"" Wi-Fi, so that passengers will have to go through the airline's own system to gamble. Houssard and Alfano also don't see online gambling as competition to their own concept. ""When you're gambling on your screen, or on your phone, you're still cramped with other people. If you get out of your seat and enter another space with your friends and colleagues, it gives you a completely different experience,"" notes Alfano. ""When you're on a 14-hour flight, even when you're in business class, all you can really do is eat, drink, watch movies and sleep. The Casino Jet Lounge isn't just a bar or entertainment idea. We see it as a social space."" It's difficult to imagine that airlines would be willing to give over potential passenger space (and the fares that come with it) to a social arena, but Alfano says if designed properly, there shouldn't be a conflict. See also: In-flight phone calls to become standard, experts say . ""Most big aircrafts have crew rest areas and lavatories in the cargo area down below. The space could be easily rearranged to include a social space, without representing a loss of revenue,"" he says. The biggest obstacle to in-flight gambling, however, is a legal one. Since 1994, gambling has been prohibited in U.S. airspace. Still, Houssard believes that this might change in the future. ""A few years ago, it was forbidden to play games for money on the internet. It was not open then, but now you can play online. A lot of things are changing.""","Two French design studios have teamed up to create a model for an in-fight casino .

"Talks with Iran over its nuclear program resume Thursday. Make no mistake: The deal the Obama administration is pursuing with Iran over its nuclear program is a good deal. It will leave Iran with neither a nuclear weapon nor an undetectable breakout capability. And by ensuring that the deal also is a win for Iran, Tehran won't have incentives to cheat and violate the agreement. Based on conversations with diplomats on both sides of the table, I believe it is a durable deal that enhances America's security and nonproliferation goals while making Iran much less hostile and U.S. allies in the region much more safe. And make no mistake about the flip side: The alternative to this deal -- the continuation of the sanctions path -- will see Iran continue to inch toward a nuclear weapons option while the U.S. and Iran gravitate toward a disastrous military confrontation. It's either a deal or another war in the Middle East. Those are the stakes. It is true that Iran is eager to get a deal. President Hassan Rouhani will likely lose the popular support he enjoys unless he can find a fix to Iran's economic troubles. The best way of achieving that goal is to reduce Iran's tensions with the U.S. and get sanctions lifted by showing flexibility on the nuclear issue. But it is also true that Washington needs a deal. Iran's nuclear program has steadily advanced over the years. As the West has escalated sanctions to gain leverage, the Iranians have escalated their nuclear program for the same reason. In 2005, the Iranians offered to cap their enrichment program at 3,000 centrifuges.  The West nixed that offer. By the time the George W. Bush administration left office, the Iranians had around 7,221 centrifuges. Today, they have more than 19,000 centrifuges. Their stockpile of low enriched uranium has reached more than 10,000 kilograms. It was around 1,000 kilograms when Barack Obama took office. The end result is that the Iranians have added a lot of new facts on the ground, making a complete roll back a near impossibility. The nuclear deal that could have been secured years ago is likely more attractive than any deal Washington can strike a year from now. In addition, Washington's current negotiation cards may soon expire. The sanctions regime and the international consensus to isolate Tehran might quickly disintegrate if talks fail and the blame falls on Washington (read Congress). In fact, the Iranians are counting on this. The more forthcoming, flexible and reasonable they come across on the nuclear issue in their current charm offensive and the more the U.S. Congress puts its hawkishness and dysfunctionality on public display, the easier they can shift the blame for the impasse onto the United States and the more successful they will be in peeling countries off from the sanctions regime. This is exactly how Obama succeeded in securing this unlikely sanctions program in the first place: His extended hand of friendship in 2009 and Tehran's inability to unclench its fist shifted the blame squarely to the rulers of Iran. As a result, sanctions that the Bush administration did not even dare to dream of became reality only 18 months into Obama's presidency. The Iranians have now set the stage to return the favor if Congress fails to be serious about a deal. Those in Congress worried that even the offer of modest sanctions relief in the talks will cause the collapse of the current sanctions infrastructure must consider how quickly sanctions can fall apart if there isn't a deal. In the former case, Washington will extract valuable concessions from Iran in return for the lifting of sanctions. In the latter case, Washington will lose the sanctions without getting anything from the Iranians. And the moment the sanctions regime begins to fall apart while Tehran continues to expand its nuclear program, the calls for military action will rise once more. That would be the cost of Congress overplaying its hand. No wonder U.S. lead negotiator Wendy Sherman told CNN after the last round of talks that ""we have to do everything we can to reach a diplomatic solution."" She continued: ""There are other options, but a diplomatic solution is the best option, and we all have to do everything we can as quickly as we can to see if in fact we can achieve just that."" The American people sent an unmistakable message to Congress against war with Syria. On Iran, the American public needs to make its voice heard on Capitol Hill once more in order to avoid a war that would be far more devastating than Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan combined. Fortunately, diplomacy is not only the best available option, the deal Obama is pursuing is also a very good option.

"A 29-year-old woman, remembered by her mother for her ""heart of gold."" A Boston University graduate student from China who'd gone to enjoy the marathon's finish with two classmates. An 8-year-old boy, cheering on runners with his family. All of them, gone. Their lives were snuffed out by twin blasts at the tail end of Monday's Boston Marathon. Thirteen others -- out of 183 hospitalized -- had limbs amputated, according to hospital officials. The question is: Why? The victims: Promising lives lost in tragedy . More than a day later, authorities don't have an answer. Unlike after the September 11, 2001, attacks, no one claimed responsibility for this terrorist attack. No one had been identified as a suspect. The attack came out of nowhere, with no threat. Just horror. As Richard DesLauriers, the special agent in charge of the FBI's Boston office, put it Tuesday afternoon: ""The range of suspects and motives remains wide open."" The two identical pressure-cooker bombs -- each with the capacity to hold six liters of liquid, according to a Boston law enforcement source -- blew up seconds and a short distance apart on Boston's Boylston Street. They contained BB-like pellets and nails, the FBI's DesLauriers said, causing even more damage. Photos obtained by CNN, which were in a bulletin sent to federal law enforcement agencies, showed parts of a pressure cooker, a shredded black backpack and what appear to be metal pellets or ball bearings. Such evidence -- including a partial circuit board -- are headed to an FBI facility in Quantico, Virginia, where authorities will try to determine how the devices worked and cull out clues identifying the person or persons responsible. More on the investigation into the bombings . Whatever investigators find, whenever they find it, it won't take away the pain. Scores who are not grieving loved ones are faced with a lengthy physical recovery. There's the psychological battle as well -- living with the memories of the deafening blasts, the carnage, the fear as they searched for loved ones. Ron Brassard was one of them. One second, he was laughing and smiling. The next second, there was a roaring blast, originating  from about 10 feet away, and he looked down to see a ""puddle of blood."" He later discovered a ""chunk of the leg was just not there."" His wife was hospitalized, too, and a friend lost both her legs. Brassard told CNN's Anderson Cooper he is angry. But he's also not about to let this terror change him, any more than it already has. ""You can't let people control your life like that,"" Brassard said from his hospital bed. ""You just can't."" Hundreds run toward carnage to help . The pressure wave from Monday's explosions in Boston's historic Copley Square whipped the once limp international flags straight out, as if they were caught in a hurricane. Some runners said they thought the first blast was a celebratory cannon. By the second, there were no such illusions. The scene on the ground was sheer horror. Blood and unconscious people were everywhere. So, too, were people who went to help. Boston heroes run to help . Some were spectators, like Carlos Arredondo. An affiliate of the Red Cross, he tended to a man who'd lost two of  his limbs. Dr. Natalie Stavas, a pediatric resident at Boston Children's Hospital, was near the home stretch of the race she was running with her father when she heard the blasts. Despite having run 26 miles, she went over barriers and past policemen, until one stopped her. Stavas told CNN she told him she was a doctor and pleaded, ""You have to let me help, you have to let me through."" She said she performed CPR on the first person she encountered. For the next two, she worked to halt their bleeding. Stavas stressed that there were hundreds of others doing whatever they could. ""It was horrific. It was the worst thing I've ever seen,"" Stavas said. ""It was unbelievable."" Nails, metal beads found in patients . While authorities have given no indication they know who was behind the attack, they have offered details on the devices used. DesLauriers, from the FBI, said the bombs were possibly placed in pressure cookers hidden inside a backpack or another black nylon bag. Another law enforcement official told CNN it was ""likely but not certain"" the bombs were on a timer, not set off remotely by a cell phone. Experts see hallmarks of 'lone wolf' devices . Another federal law enforcement official said both bombs were small, and initial tests showed no C-4 or other high-grade explosive, suggesting the materials used in the attack were crude. And deadly. Those killed include 8-year-old Martin Richard, a resident of the city's Dorchester neighborhood whom babysitter Caitlin Doyle recalled as ""just all-around a wonderful kid (with) a big, bright smile that no one could ever forget."" There was 29-year-old Krystle Campbell, who was ""fun, outgoing (and) always there to help somebody,"" her grandmother Lillian Campbell said. Lastly, there was the Boston University graduate student from China -- whom the school and Chinese consulate declined to identify by name. According to a LinkedIn profile, she graduated from a Chinese university with a degree in international economics and was set to earn her master's degree in mathematics and statistics in 2014 from B.U. Others survived, thanks largely to the work of emergency personnel and volunteers on-site and scores of professionals in several world-class hospitals nearby. Doctors removed more than a dozen nails from one patient, and three had been struck with metal beads slightly larger than BBs, said Dr. Ron Walls, the emergency medicine chairman at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Back in Copley Square, in the heart of Boston, investigators on Tuesday continued searching for any hint that might lead them to the perpetrator. Authorities also pleaded for the public's help. Did they know of anyone who made a threat involving April 15 or the marathon? Did they hear explosions in a remote area, possibly as a test run? And did they spot anyone near the finish line dropping off what ended up being the two bombs? Obama calls attack 'terror' By 5 p.m. Tuesday, the FBI had gotten more than 2,000 tips, DesLauriers said. They'd also begun poring over scores of photos and videos from the scene. ""We are doing this methodically,"" he said, ""... and with a sense of urgency."" Mayor: 'We will not let terror take us over' At one point, 11 Boston-area hospitals had 23 people in critical condition and 40 listed as serious. There are still some fighting, with more surgeries planned. But there is progress. In fact, according to a CNN tally, at least 100 of the 183 people who received treatment were able to go home by Tuesday night. How Boston and America recovers over the coming days, weeks and months remains to be seen. As has happened before after such terror attacks, Tuesday saw authorities responding to alerts and threats -- in places like Dallas, Cleveland and New York -- that all proved to be unfounded. Security in Los Angeles and New York has been stepped up in light of the Boston attack, and authorities in London are reviewing measures for that city's upcoming marathon. Back in Massachusetts, one question is what becomes of the Boston Marathon -- the world's oldest annual marathon, dating to 1897, drawing more than 20,000 participants. Rather than shutting it down, officials promised to build the race back up. ""Next year's marathon will be even bigger and better,"" Gov. Deval Patrick. That sense of defiance was echoed by Mayor Thomas Menino. Residents and visitors to the city might have to deal with more checks at transit stations and elsewhere. They might have to get used to seeing more authorities out and about. But they shouldn't change their attitudes, said the mayor. ""This tragedy is not going to stop Boston,"" Menino said. ""We will not let terror take us over.""","Photos shows parts of a pressure cooker, backpack and pellets .

"It is easy to see the Chicago teachers strike as an unfortunate incident that will soon pass.   This is, after all, their first strike in 25 years.  The norm is that the district and the Chicago Teachers Union have regularly negotiated their way to contracts every several years.  So it might appear that, almost always, collective bargaining ""works."" But does it?  The purpose of the Chicago school system — and of the American school system more generally — is to educate children.  The way to assess collective bargaining is not to ask whether it works to bring labor peace.  It is to ask whether it promotes the interests of children in a quality education.  And the answer to that question is no, it does not.  Not even remotely. Opinion: America would be better off with more strikes . Collective bargaining is not fundamentally about children. It is about the power and special interests of adults.  In Chicago and elsewhere, the teachers unions are in the business of winning better salaries and benefits, protecting job security, pressuring for restrictive work rules and in other ways advancing the occupational interests of their members.  These interests are simply not the same as the interests of children. And they inevitably lead, through the exercise of union power, to contracts whose countless formal rules are literally not designed to create an effective organization for schools.  In fact, they guarantee that the schools will be organized in perverse ways that no one in their right mind would favor if they just cared about what is best for kids. Because of the formal rules that unions fight for in labor contracts, district leaders can almost never get bad teachers out of the classroom. Nor can they allocate good teachers to the schools and classrooms where they can do the greatest good for kids.  Add to this that the evaluation process is a full-blown charade, and 99% of all teachers, including the very worst teachers, are regularly given satisfactory evaluations.  Also, teachers are paid based on their seniority and formal credits, without any regard for whether their students are learning anything. And so it goes.  This is a school system organized for the benefit of the people who work in it, not for the kids they are expected to teach. Schools of thought: What are the key issues . Collective bargaining is not the only arena in which jobs take priority over kids.  It also happens in the politics of state and national governments, which should be governing the public schools in the best interests of kids, but aren't. A major reason is that the teachers unions are by far the most powerful political force in American education. The National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers have some 4.5 million members between them, they are among the top spenders in state and national elections, they have activists in virtually every electoral district in the country, they have formidable lobbying machines and much more.  They are among the most powerful special interests of any type in the country. What have they done with all this political power?  For more than a quarter century, this country has been frantically trying to reform and bring real improvement, effective organization, to the public school system.  And the unions have used their political power to block or seriously weaken these efforts: by preventing the spread of charter schools, undermining true accountability for schools and teachers, resisting performance pay, protecting teacher tenure and in countless ways defending a poorly performing status quo.  Very successfully. Every one of us pays the price.  Our children are being denied a quality education, fulfilling careers and productive lives. The nation is losing precious human capital, its long-term economic growth is taking a direct and destructive hit and its position of leadership in the world is seriously threatened. Teachers: Why do you teach? So, yes, Chicago's teachers are out on strike.  That is today's news, today's headline.  But the real problem is much larger.  It is that power over this nation's key educational decisions — in Chicago and virtually everywhere else — is disproportionately exercised by special interests. Long after Chicago's teachers are back to work, this problem will remain.  The fundamental challenge facing our country is to find some way of solving it.","Chicago teachers are on strike for the first time in 25 years over contract disputes .

"Facing renewed controversy about the safety of energy drinks, Monster Energy Corp. has decided to market its products as beverages instead of dietary supplements.

Monster Energy's products will not change, but in the coming months its labels will include the caffeine content in each can. ""Monster has a commitment to being responsible and wants to be transparent about the ingredients in their products,"" Taylor said in an e-mail. Energy drinks have been under intense scrutiny lately. Last year the parents of a 14-year-old girl filed a lawsuit against Monster after their daughter died following the consumption of two Monster Energy beverages that contained a combined 480 milligrams of caffeine. That's the equivalent of drinking about 20 8-ounce cans of soda. In November, the Food and Drug Administration began investigating 13 deaths that were preliminarily linked to the dietary supplement 5-hour Energy. The deaths had been reported to the FDA as ""adverse events,"" which does not mean the product is responsible for or that it contributed to any health issue. The manufacturer, packer or distributor of a dietary supplement is required to notify the FDA of any adverse events linked to its product, according to agency spokeswoman Tamara Ward. That requirement does not apply to products sold as beverages or food. The FDA has received 20 adverse event reports about Monster products; five are linked to a death. Again, these reports do not represent any conclusion by the FDA about whether the product is responsible for a health problem, Ward said in an e-mail. ""When important information is missing from a report, it is difficult for FDA to fully evaluate whether the product caused the adverse event or simply coincided with it."" This week, 18 public health experts sent a letter to the FDA about the safety of energy drinks. The scientists have concluded there is not enough evidence to show that high levels of caffeine in energy drinks are safe. ""To the contrary, the best available scientific evidence demonstrates a robust correlation between the caffeine levels in energy drinks and adverse health and safety consequences, particularly among children, adolescents,"" they wrote. Monster does not recommend children, pregnant women or those sensitive to caffeine consume its beverages, Taylor said. ""That recommendation is on the labels of all Monster products."" Caffeine stimulates your central nervous system, according to the FDA. It can increase your heart rate, raise your blood pressure and cause irregular heart rhythms. The FDA regulates caffeine in sodas at a level of .02%, or 200 parts per million (there is no current FDA caffeine limit for energy drinks). That translates to about 50 milligrams in an 8-ounce can. A 2012 Consumer Reports analysis found about 90 milligrams of caffeine in an 8-ounce can of Monster Energy, and the drink comes in sizes up to 24 ounces. To compare, a 16-ounce Starbucks Grande has 330 milligrams, according to Consumer Reports. The scientists say caffeine in energy drinks differs from that in coffee because the caffeine in coffee occurs naturally, instead of being added by a manufacturer. (Food additives are subject to regulation by the FDA.) The FDA is reviewing current scientific studies on the safety of energy drinks, Ward said, and is monitoring new ingredients being added to these products. So should consumers stay away from energy drinks, or supplements? The FDA hasn't made any recommendations but cautions people to consult with their doctors to make sure they don't have an underlying medical condition that too much caffeine could affect.","Monster Energy drinks will no longer be sold as dietary supplements .
Drink labels will now include the amount of caffeine in each can .
Monster will no longer be required to submit reports of ""adverse events"" to the FDA ."
"(CNN) -- Americans are exercising more than in the past, but most are still not working out enough to meet federal guidelines, a new survey shows. The CDC says more highly educated people were more likely to say they got regular exercise. From 2001 to 2005, the number of women who said they exercised regularly rose from 43 percent to 46.7 percent; the number of men who said the same thing rose from 46 percent to 49.6 percent, according to a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""Physical activity is increasing among American adults,"" said lead author and epidemiologist Isa Miles. But she added, ""They still have a little work to do."" The study looked at data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, which compared telephone responses from 205,140 people in 2002 with responses from 356,112 in 2005. Regular physical activity was defined as at least 30 minutes per day of moderate-intensity activity at least five days per week or at least 20 minutes per day of vigorous-intensity activity at least three days per week. The study found that racial and ethnic differences persist. Among men, non-Latino whites reported exercising the most (52.3 percent), followed by ""other race"" (45.7 percent), non-Latino blacks (45.3 percent) and Latinos (41.9 percent). Among women, non-Latina whites were most active (49.6 percent), followed by ""other race"" women (46.6 percent), Latinas (40.5 percent), and non-Latina blacks (36.1 percent). People with more education were more likely to say they got regular exercise. Among people who said they had graduated from college, the figures were 54.6 percent for men and 53.3 percent for women, versus slightly more than a third of men and women (37.2 percent and 37.1 percent, respectively) who said they had not graduated high school. Inactivity has been linked to increased risk for heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity. The authors acknowledged the study has limitations: The data was self-reported, meaning that its accuracy depended on people's ability to recall what happened and to report it truthfully. In addition, the survey did not include people without land-line phones. More recent surveys included calls to cell phones, a CDC spokeswoman said. The CDC's Miles said she is among the minority of Americans who said they engage in regular physical activity but added, ""You do have to trust me."" She said the study's release on the day before Thanksgiving, when many Americans spend time on a couch in front of a television set, was ""purely coincidental.""

"Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is threatening to kill the 73 Yemeni troops it is holding hostage if the government does not release al Qaeda prisoners. In a statement issued late Thursday, the group advised family members of the hostages to push the government to cooperate, but a senior security official in the southern province of Abyan, where the troops are being held, said the government would not give in to the group's demands. ""We will work on freeing the soldiers being held by the militants, but only by reasonable means. The government will not set free any militants. This will only make the terror crisis even worse,"" said the security official, who is not authorized to talk to media. The official said three of the troops had already been killed. The threat of more killings came as Yemen mourned the approximately 200 troops killed this week by al Qaeda in three Yemeni provinces. President Abdurabu Hadi vowed Thursday to step up government efforts to fight al Qaeda, saying he will not allow Yemen to fall into the hands of extremists. A delegation from the Yemen Military Committee, the highest security authority in the country, reached Abyan on Wednesday as part of an investigation into how al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) has been able to score consistent victories in the region over the past week. Western officials describe AQAP as al Qaeda's most dangerous affiliate. ""We expected obstacles, but the president will do all in his power to uproot the terror militants from the country,"" said Yahya al-Arassi, the president's spokesman. ""This is a promise he gave the people."" AQAP has tried to win support by portraying itself as a defender of Yemenis against a U.S.-backed dictatorship. The group is linked to jihadist fighters who have taken control of swathes of southern Yemen. The United Nations refugee agency said Friday that tens of thousands of civilians are fleeing tribal clashes in the north and fighting between government troops and militants in the south. In the Haradh governorate, north of the capital, Sanaa, tribal clashes over the past three months have displaced about 52,000 people, Yemeni authorities have said, according to the spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Adrian Edwards. Another 314,000 Yemenis were already displaced in the country's north, he said in a news release. A peace agreement was signed in June 2010 between the government and Al-Houti forces but the situation in northern Yemen is volatile and insecure, the UNHCR said. ""We continue to run two camps for displaced Yemenis in the north and have been providing assistance to internally displaced persons in the camps and in host communities,"" Edwards said. In the south, at least 1,800 people have been displaced by recent fighting between government troops and militants in the Abyan governorate, the UNHCR said. They have joined more than 150,000 others in the south who have been displaced since last May, when the conflict began.","Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula vows to kill 73 Yemeni troops .

"The recent news that a group of highly respected medical experts, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, is considering advising against routine prostate cancer screening shouldn't have come as too much of a surprise to anybody. Indeed, the fact that so many people now are claiming to be surprised is an interesting story. Many respected organizations that issue screening guidelines have for a long time expressed concern about the effectiveness and known risks of screening for prostate cancer. The list of groups that have expressed caution about widespread use of the prostate-specific antigen test, known as PSA, includes the American Urological Association, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, the European Urology Association and the American Cancer Society. Here is the problem in a nutshell: Widespread PSA screening began 20 years ago, amazingly, well before anyone bothered to initiate studies to find out whether such screening saves lives. Because doctors and patients believed that screening works — wasn't it obvious that it would? — they opposed rigorous studies, called randomized trials, that assign half the patients to get screening while the other half goes unscreened. Despite opposition from doctors and patients, the trials finally got done, and today the harms of screening are better proved than the benefits. A substantial number of men receive unnecessary treatment, as their cancers are so slow-growing they are not life-threatening.  These treatments commonly lead to harms such as impotence and incontinence and can even lead to premature death.  This, while the benefits -- the number of lives saved -- are very small at best, nonexistent at worst. Alas, the history of medicine is filled with examples of physicians jumping the gun, acting in a manner unsupported by evidence, even ignoring the words of caution in the ""evidence-based guidelines"" promulgated by their own professional societies. I am convinced that most advocates of screening and aggressive treatment are motivated by genuine desire to benefit men.  Unfortunately, they are uninformed or unwilling to believe the reality that early detection and aggressive treatment of cancer is not always the best thing. For two decades, some supporters of prostate cancer screening, even some so-called experts, have overstated, exaggerated and, in some cases, misled the public about the evidence supporting its effectiveness. They downplayed or failed to mention the risks of screening and misapplied and misstated basic principles of cancer screening. With evangelical fervor, true believers conducted mass screening in shopping malls, at state fairs and in supermarket parking lots. Screening has been sponsored by medical practices, hospitals, drug and medical device companies, politicians and even manufacturers of adult diapers.  Most of these sponsors wanted to do a public service, but many profited from it.  Some may also have been blinded by that profit. The phenomenon of so-called experts, who do not understand basic principles of screening, making exaggerated statements is not limited to prostate cancer.  It also occurs in breast and lung cancer screening.  Well-designed scientific study has clearly showed that these procedures save lives, but science has also demonstrated that the procedures have limitations and risks of harm. The Task Force, an independent board of experts in interpretation of medical evidence, convened by the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, sanctioned true screening experts to review and assess every published scientific study concerning prostate cancer screening. This recently published review is very reasonable.  It recognizes that the few studies that suggest that prostate screening saves lives are undermined by biases and inconsistencies. Of course, the studies that did not show a benefit to screening also have flaws.  However, all studies consistently show that significant harms are associated with screening and the sometimes unnecessary treatment. Ironically, the Task Force recommendation isn't too far apart from that of the American Urologic Association, which represents most of the doctors who diagnose and treat prostate cancer. The association's 2009 publication titled ""PSA Screening Best Practice"" reads: ""Given the uncertainty that PSA testing results in more benefit than harm, a thoughtful and broad approach to PSA is critical. Patients need to be informed of the risks and benefits of testing before it is undertaken. The risks of overdetection and overtreatment should be included in this discussion."" While the Task Force statement is wise and reasonable, there is risk that the pendulum will swing too far. A move against all use of the PSA tests in screening and diagnostics would be unfortunate.  The Task Force review does see some benefit to prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment.  Guarded use of PSA testing as a diagnostic tool in select individuals within the physician-patient relation is reasonable and consistent with the U.S. Preventive Taskforce statement. Cancer screening is complex. Some outspoken clinician advocates of screening need to understand that complexity.  We need balanced, truthful information widely available to physicians and patients. Sadly, the overselling and overpromise of screening technology in cancer and other diseases harms patients and — justifiably -- weakens trust in the medical profession. It also adds to the unnecessarily high cost of health care, which is already threatening the health of the U.S. economy. More than anything, the battle over prostate cancer screening raises a disturbing question: Are we as a society prepared to pay attention to scientific evidence?","U.S. preventive services panel is considering advising against routine PSA screening .

"Israel intercepted a rocket fired at Tel Aviv on Tuesday and killed militants who stormed into Israeli territory, the military said, as people on both sides of the Gaza border were living under a barrage of attacks from the air. In a dramatic escalation of the conflict, militants fired more than 130 rockets at Israeli civilians, Israel said. Palestinians reported 24 people in Gaza were killed and more than 150 injured in Israeli airstrikes. Israel said it targeted about 150 ""terror sites"" in Gaza. The warning sirens that blared in Tel Aviv, one of Israel's most populated areas, showed a threat Israel had warned of. The country said militants' rockets from Gaza are powerful enough to reach 3.5 million Israeli citizens. ""Hamas will pay a heavy price for its vicious attacks on millions of Israeli civilians,"" the Israel Defense Forces said on Twitter. ""No nation would accept constant rocket fire. Neither will we,"" the IDF said, using the hashtag #ItMustStop. Islamic Jihad, another Palestinian militant group, took responsibility for the rocket fired at Tel Aviv.  In a statement, the group called it a ""response to the ongoing Zionist aggression."" Hamas controls Gaza.  Israel has said it holds Hamas responsible for the actions of militant groups inside the territory. Hamas, on Twitter, used the hashtag #Gazaunderattack and warned, ""Retaliations are coming, it is a matter of time."" Flare-up in Israeli-Palestinian violence: Why now? Hamas later claimed responsibility for firing rockets on Jerusalem and Haifa. Three explosions sounded just west of the capital. There were no immediate reports of casualties. ""The occupation started this aggression and it must pay the price. We will be the ones to define the cost of the bill,"" Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum posted on his Facebook page. The possibility of an Israeli incursion into Gaza loomed, with the Cabinet authorizing the military to call up 40,000 troops if needed -- 10,000 more than were called up during Israel's offensive into Gaza in November of 2012. Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, a military spokesman, said that only about 1,000 have been called up so far. He referred to ""possible ground maneuvers."" Israeli Intelligence Minister Yuval Steinitz told CNN a ground operation ""might become necessary."" But it was Hamas that claimed responsibility for ""storming"" into Israeli territory Tuesday. Hamas-controlled television reported ""from the heart of the battlefield"" that a group of its ""commandos"" was ""conducting its duties in Zikim Zionist military base according to plan."" Zikim lies just north of Gaza and south of the Israeli city of Ashkelon. The group of militants tried to enter Zikim through the water, Israeli media reported. Israeli soldiers spotted the divers in the water and called in an infantry force, Israel's Channel 10 reported. An exchange of fire ensued. Israel responded by infantry, air force, and navy, Lerner said.  Five attackers -- armed with Kalashnikoves and hand grenades -- were killed, the Israel Defense Forces said.  One Israeli soldier was lightly wounded, and the situation was ongoing as of Tuesday evening on the beach near the military's base in Zikim, he said. Meanwhile, Hamas said it blew up a tunnel under Karem Shalom, an Israeli town near Gaza's southern border.  The town's residents were ordered to turn off all lights in their homes, Channel 10 reported.  Israeli aircraft hovered above and fired toward Gaza, the station said. People in 'human shield' killed on Gaza rooftop . Among the dead in Gaza was Mohammad Sha'aban, a leader of Hamas' militant wing, Palestinian sources said. Israel confirmed that Sha'aban, ""a senior Hamas terrorist,"" was killed. Another militant was killed in an Israeli airstrike on an open field in Gaza. Several Palestinians were killed in an airstrike on a Gaza rooftop. Palestinian medical sources told CNN the death toll was 10, but then lowered it to seven. Official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported that six were killed. Those killed were forming a ""human shield"" on the roof of a home belonging to members of Hamas' militant wing, Palestinian sources said. Two were children, WAFA and Palestinian medical sources said. The home was near another home belonging to the same Hamas members that Israel struck Monday night, Palestinian sources said. Palestinians said another of the 24 killed was a child who died of wounds after an airstrike on a motorcycle. The Israeli military, on Twitter, said Hamas ""uses Palestinians as human shields when firing rockets at Israel."" The tweet included a photo of what Israel said showed Hamas ""caught firing a rocket"" from a civilian area. Israeli warnings: Stay away from Hamas . A CNN producer was among those who received an automated phone call from the Israeli military. It warned people in Arabic to stay away from members of Hamas and other terrorist groups in Gaza and not to cooperate with them ""because they are risking your lives."" The message told people not to use their homes to store arsenals for terrorist groups. ""Anyone who is present in these buildings risks their lives."" On Monday, Israel dropped fliers telling residents that terrorist groups and those who smuggle weapons continue to hide among residents even though they know they are ""always a target for the Israel Defense Forces."" It warned that those activities create dangers for residents and their children. The fliers provided phone numbers and e-mail addresses for Gazans to secretly provide information about militant activities. The Israeli military's Operation Protective Edge against Hamas is part of an effort ""to restore a state of security,"" Lerner, the Israeli military spokesman, told CNN on Tuesday. Teens' deaths sparked new violence . Tensions in the region reached a fever pitch after three Israeli teens, including one dual U.S. citizen, on their way home from school in the West Bank were kidnapped last month. Israel blames Hamas. Their bodies were found last week. Later in the week, a Palestinian teen was abducted and then found dead within an hour in Jerusalem. Israel has arrested suspects and says there's ""strong indication"" it was a revenge killing. Amid clashes in the days following, the Palestinian teen's American cousin, who was visiting, was beaten by men in Israeli security uniforms. Israel also announced a confession in the May killing of another Israeli Jewish teen. The suspect is an Arab resident of northern Israel, and police believe the attack was fueled by Palestinian ""nationalism."" Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, who was criticized by Palestinians when he condemned the Israeli teens' kidnappings, called on Israel on Tuesday to immediately stop its strikes, warning the operation would drag the region into instability. Abbas said a truce was needed to ""spare the innocent from mass destruction."" And presidential spokesman Nabil Abu Rdainah accused Israel of carrying out an ""open massacre"" against children, women and the elderly, WAFA reported. He said Israel is making a ""decision to expand the war,"" which he said will drag ""the region into a spiral of bloody violence"" that ""will burn everyone."" Long-range threat . Israel says the aim of its offensive is to strike Hamas in Gaza and stop rocket fire into Israel that threatens civilians. Hamas is estimated to have 10,000 rockets of varying ranges, Lerner said, including some that can reach as far north as Tel Aviv and beyond. Israel confirmed that a rocket hit the city of Hadera, which is some 62 miles (100 kilometers) from Gaza. ""They have substantial armaments which can strike the soft underbelly of Israel,"" Lerner said. He said the Israel Defense Forces' position had changed from focusing on de-escalation to preparing for a deterioration of the situation. 'Red lines' crossed . The conflict between the two sides has worsened in the past few days. ""The enemy has crossed the red lines and will be made to pay the price for its crimes,"" Mushir Al-Masri, a Hamas leadership figure and member of the Palestinian parliament, wrote on his Facebook page Monday. ""The blood of our martyrs is precious ... and is fuel for the intifada and the resistance."" After that statement, the barrage of rockets from Gaza into Israel increased, with Hamas claiming responsibility. Political strains . The conflict is creating strains within the governing coalition of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman, head of the Yisrael Beiteinu party, said in a news conference Monday that he told Netanyahu of his intention to dissolve his party's joint faction with Netanyahu's Likud party, saying it was ""not working."" Lieberman criticized Netanyahu's handling of Gaza. Tensions are also increasing between Hamas, which controls Gaza, and the more moderate Palestinian Authority in the West Bank.

"London, England (CNN) -- A British oil rig has started drilling off the Falkland Islands in a move likely to stoke further tensions between Argentina and the UK over the disputed South Atlantic territory. In a statement to the London Stock Exchange, British oil and gas exploration company Desire Petroleum said the Ocean Guardian rig had begun drilling an exploration well in the North Falkland Basin, some 100 kilometers (60 miles) north of the islands. Desire estimates that the North Falkland Basin could contain 3.5 billion barrels of oil as well as having ""significant gas potential."" The exploratory drilling is expected to last around 30 days, a spokesman for the company told CNN. But potential revenues from oil and gas have reignited a long-running dispute between London and Buenos Aires over ownership of the Falklands. Last Tuesday Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner signed a decree requiring all ships navigating from Argentina to the islands to carry a government permit. The Falklands, known as Las Malvinas in Argentina, lie in the South Atlantic Ocean off the Argentinean coast and have been under British rule since 1833. Argentina has always claimed sovereignty over the islands and invaded them in 1982, prompting a war in which more than 600 Argentinean and 255 British military personnel died. The island's government, representing a population of around 2,500, remains committed to British sovereignty and the UK maintains a military presence on the islands. The spokesman for Desire said that the company was not commenting on political issues and was ""focusing on the drilling campaign."" The Argentine position is that natural resources around the islands should be protected, and Britain must accept international resolutions labeling the Falklands a disputed area. ""This has to do with the defense of the interests of Argentineans, not just about sovereignty,"" Argentine Cabinet Chief Anibal Fernandez said last week, adding that Argentina lays claim not just to the islands, but to any resources that could be found there. In a statement last week, the Falkland Islands government said it had ""every right to develop a hydrocarbons industry within our waters."" ""The British Government has clearly stated that they support our right to develop legitimate business,"" it said. ""The British Government have also reiterated their stance on our British sovereignty.""","Argentina and UK at odds over ownership of South Atlantic islands .

"In an open letter to President Barack Obama published Tuesday, dozens of doctors asked to be allowed to treat hunger-striking prisoners at the U.S. detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. For four months, many detainees at Guantanamo have been on a hunger strike, protesting their detention at the facility. ""It is clear that they do not trust their military doctors,"" the more than 150 doctors and other medical professionals wrote in an open letter published online by The Lancet medical journal. ""They have very good reason for this, as you should know, from the current protocols of the Joint Task Force Guantanamo, which those doctors are ordered to follow."" In May, 13 detainees wrote an open letter in the UK-based Guardian newspaper asking to see civilian doctors because they said they did not trust the military doctors whom they accused of force-feeding them against their will. In their letter to Obama, the doctors and medical professionals said:  ""The orders they receive are ultimately your orders as their Commander-in-Chief. Without trust, safe and acceptable medical care of mentally competent patients is impossible. Since the detainees do not trust their military doctors, they are unlikely to comply with current medical advice."" Of the 166 detainees at Guantanamo, 104 are on a hunger strike to protest their treatment an indefinite detention, according to Capt. Robert Durand, a spokesman for the detention facility. Forty-four of the detainees have received ""enteral feeding,"" where a tube is inserted through the nose and down the throat to administer liquids, military officials said. The detainee protest began last year, with five to six detainees starting and stopping hunger strikes. But the number grew after lawyers for some of those held drew attention to conditions at the facility, Army Lt. Col. Todd Breasseale, a spokesman on detainee issues at the Pentagon, said earlier this year. Human rights groups have long protested the detention of suspected enemy fighters who haven't been charged with crimes. The government says the detainees are too dangerous to transfer but cannot be tried, characterizing them as war prisoners under the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force Act. Obama has recently renewed his vow to shut the prison established last decade to house suspected terrorists. The open letter from the doctors came a day after the federal government was forced to release the names of dozens of detainees at the military prison after a newspaper sued the federal government for the information. The list released Monday identifies 46 inmates being held for ""continued detention"" at the facility. The report was made public after a lawsuit by the Miami Herald. The Obama administration first acknowledged that detainees were being held indefinitely in Guantanamo in 2010 but didn't make their identities public until now. Of the 46 detainees listed for indefinite detention, the report shows that 26 are from Yemen, 10 are from Afghanistan, three are from Saudi Arabia, two each are from Libya and Kuwait, and one each are from Kenya, Somalia and Morocco.","The Lancet medical journal published the open letter on Tuesday .

"Darren Wilson was just one of 53 officers in a small-town police department until his encounter with a unarmed 18-year-old last Saturday on a street in Ferguson, Missouri. Authorities, citing death threats, had refused to release Wilson's name in the days after he fatally shot Michael Brown. A resident of the St. Louis area, Wilson, 28, has been staying at a secure location since the shooting. On Friday, Police Chief Thomas Jackson disclosed the identity of the man whose actions sparked sometimes violent protests and thrust the city of 22,400, a St. Louis suburb, into the national spotlight. It was not known whether Wilson, an officer for six years, has been placed on modified assignment. Jackson told reporters the officer had faced no disciplinary action during his time on the job. Brown was African-American; Wilson is white. Hours after the officer's name was released, however, little further information emerged about him. The disclosure of his identity, in fact, was overshadowed by new details from the police implicating Brown in a convenience store robbery that was reported shortly before the shooting. The claim was immediately greeted with skepticism and anger from some in the community who have accused Ferguson police of attempting a cover-up. Attorneys for Brown's family released a statement Friday saying they were ""beyond outraged"" over the timing of the robbery allegation, and accused the police of blaming the victim. ""There is nothing based on the facts that have been placed before us that can justify the execution style murder of their child by this police officer as he held his hands up,"" the statement said. Missouri's governor, Jay Nixon, told reporters, ""I think the focal point here remains to figure how and why Michael Brown was killed. New head of Ferguson security: 'How would I feel?' The police chief, before speaking to reporters, told CNN's Don Lemon that the officer was ""devastated"" by what had happened. Jackson has described the officer as well-mannered and respectful. ""This is his community,"" Jackson said. ""He never wanted any of this to happen."" Documents released by Ferguson police Friday suggested that Wilson had reason to believe he was encountering a suspect in what Jackson said was a ""strong-arm"" robbery at a convenience store. Read the police documents . The documents said Wilson, who was treated for injuries after the shooting, was in the area searching for the suspect when he spotted Brown. Brown was named in the documents as the suspect in a robbery of a $50 box of cigars. The suspect roughly handled a clerk trying to stop him before walking out of the store with a box of Swisher Sweets cigars, according to the documents. A police officer who responded to the robbery said he identified Brown as the robbery suspect by comparing surveillance images of the incident to the body of the slain teen. The images, showing a large man grabbing a smaller man by his shirt, were included with the documents released Friday. Complete coverage of the Ferguson shooting and protests . Jackson said that on the day of the shooting, the officer had responded to a call about a sick person before receiving a call about the convenience store robbery shortly before noon. Wilson had received a description of the suspect over the radio and tried to stop Brown on the street, Jackson said. The documents said four to six shots were fired. Authorities previously had not mentioned reports of a robbery in the area. Long-simmering tensions between residents, police . Police have said Brown was killed in a struggle for the officer's gun. No one has disputed that Brown was unarmed, but witnesses said he was shot as he tried to distance himself and raised his hands into the air. Brown, an African-American, was days away from starting college. The shooting sparked protests and isolated looting incidents, and police response with rubber bullets and tear gas, and arrested dozens of people. Many in the community demanded to know the name of the officer involved in the shooting. Residents complained about long-simmering tensions between the mostly African-American community and predominantly white police force. Two-thirds of Ferguson's population is black. The police chief is white. Only three African-Americans are on the 53-person police force. The mayor also is white, and so are five of the six city council members. 5 things to know about Michael Brown's shooting .","Michael Brown's family ""beyond outraged,"" saying police are blaming victim .

"President Barack Obama may have a phone and pen, but outgoing Gov. Rick Perry of Texas says he has the grounds for a lawsuit if he uses either. Speaking at the Republican Governors Association annual meeting in Boca Raton, Florida, on Wednesday, Perry said ""there's probably a very real possibility"" that Texas could sue the White House if the administration takes executive action on immigration. ""I'll speak from our perspective in the state of Texas,"" Perry said. ""The cost to the people of the state of Texas is an extraordinary amount of money that this President is exacerbating with his announcement that he's going to allow for this executive order."" The President is expected to announce his executive action plan Thursday in a prime time address. Sources familiar with the plan tell CNN that the plan includes deferring deportation for the parents of U.S. citizens, a move that would affect up to 3.5 million people. Perry will serve as until January, after which Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, also a Republican, will assume the governorship. Perry says that lawsuit would be in good hands with Abbott. ""When he (Abbott) was asked, what do you do (as attorney general for the past six years)? He said, 'I go to the office. I sue Obama, and I go home.' "" Asked whether he believed Texas will have the standing to challenge the implementation of the executive order, Perry answered, ""I do."" Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, another potential 2016 contender, also said that he would also consider legal action against the administration. ""I wouldn't push a shutdown,"" Walker said, sitting next to Perry on stage. ""I would go to the courts because I think there's a pretty compelling argument."" ""I think you would be hard-pressed to find anybody -- other than a partisan Democrat -- who wouldn't say this is illegal.""

"Having not seen or heard from her daughter in two weeks, Alexis Murphy's mother said in a CNN interview she is keeping strong with support from family and friends. ""A mother would know if her daughter is really gone, but I still have hope,"" Laura Murphy said. Alexis Murphy was last seen at a gas station earlier this month. Police have arrested a suspect in her abduction, but the suspect's attorney told a CNN affiliate his client split ways with the 17-year-old after a drug deal. Murphy's disappearance set off a search that extended 30 miles outside of Lovingston, Virginia, and involved helicopters, search parties with canine units, the Nelson County Sheriff's Office, Virginia State Police and FBI. Where is Alexis Murphy? Alexis left her Shipman, Virginia, home to visit Lynchburg on August 3, and police have surveillance video showing her at a Lovingston gas station, according to affiliate WVIR-TV in Charlottesville. Randy Taylor, 48, was seen on the video and was arrested in her abduction Sunday, police told CNN affiliate WRC-TV, but Taylor's attorney, Michael Hallahan, told WVIR that Taylor was arrested because they found one of Alexis' hairs in his camper. The attorney also told WVIR his client wasn't the last person to see Alexis and that police need to be looking for a ""black male, mid- to late-20s, cornrows and a 20-year-old burgundy Caprice with 22-inch wheels."" Taylor saw the girl the night she disappeared, the lawyer said. They were both parked at the gas pumps, and Alexis made a reference to smoking marijuana, Hallahan said. Taylor told her he'd like some marijuana, the attorney said. ""She said, 'I know a guy.' She told him to meet at another location in Lovingston and they rode up there in both cars,"" the lawyer told the station. That ""guy,"" Alexis and Taylor all took separate cars to Taylor's camper in Lovingston, where Taylor bought $60 worth of marijuana. The men smoked and drank together, but Murphy did not, the attorney said. Alexis and the unidentified man left before sundown, and that was the last Taylor saw of either of them, Hallahan told WVIR. Hallahan further told the station there is DNA evidence of the unidentified man -- in the form of a 12-ounce Icehouse bottle -- in the camper. Alexis was last seen wearing a pink blouse, floral spandex pants and brown boots, according to WRC. She was carrying a gray purse. Her 2003 Nissan Maxima was found August 6 in the parking lot of a movie theater near Charlottesville. The teen's aunt, Trina Murphy, told CNN she bought a car from a dealership where Taylor used to work, ""which is really eerie."" Another relative, Angela Taylor, described her as a ""girly girl"" and told WVIR that the volleyball player had just taken her senior pictures and was looking at colleges. ""She was just looking forward to everything, excited for everything, and for this to happen is just completely out of character for her,"" Taylor told the station.

"(CNN) -- We all have weird, irrational concerns. So, if you're just staring at your walls, drowning in fear that the great Tom Hanks may never release a digital typewriter app for your iPad, then this one is for you. Because it finally exists. I'm just not exactly sure why. But, the new Hanx Writer app definitely looks, acts, and sounds just like a real typewriter, all nestled within the technological convenience of your amazing, space-age digital tablet. The one you bought to replace your laptop. Which you bought to replace your desktop. Which we all bought to replace our typewriters when we realized we were living in the '80s and didn't have to deal with this crap anymore. Speaking of which, did you know the decline of typewriters can directly be traced to the rise of the British pop music duo, Wham!. Coincidence? Yes. Totally. Completely. It's just that I sort of got sucked into an Internet information wormhole, and that was my major takeaway. Typewriters went out. Wham! came in. Serious journalism. Anyway, I really don't mean to be critical of anyone's interest in outdated typewriters. Or even modern, pretend digital typewriters. After all, both are great if you enjoy that warm, old-world feel of seemingly irreversible mistakes. ""Dave, you misspelled seven words."" ""Whatever. It's not like it's the Torah."" ""No, it's your resume."" As for me, it's just too much trouble. I'm simply not hipster enough to fully appreciate a device that somehow makes it more difficult to write 700 words about not wearing pants. That kind of art requires only the very best modern technology. And a weird childhood. But long-form writing really isn't the point of the Hanx Writer, for it serves a completely different purpose. Digital nostalgia. And it's a hit. As I'm writing this on Thursday night, the Hanx Writer sits proudly as the No. 1 free iPad app in the iTunes store. Behold! The awesome power of Tom Hanks! He managed to take something from your parents' garage, and put it right on your iPad. But what I really find funny is the iTunes category: Productivity. Sorry, Mr. Hanks. I do appreciate the inventiveness of your app and your passion for the medium, however let's not kid ourselves. It's anything but productive. Unless, of course, your goal for the day is to make multiple spelling and punctuation mistakes. In which case, it"" s f&9#ing greatgdzfg!.; . To be fair, it does have a few necessary conveniences, like a setting which allows you to use ""modern delete."" It also provides for copy-paste. So, it's sort of a combination of old and new. Users can enjoy the feeling of a typewriter while still processing words digitally. The idea is that what you make will feel to you, and look to your reader, like something more personal than an e-mail or a text message. And Hanks argues that kind of personalization shines best through a typewriter. Even a digital one. The Oscar-winning actor is actually a huge aficionado of typewriters. A year ago, he even wrote an op-ed in the New York Times about why he loves them so much. Amazingly, Hanks says he uses a manual typewriter almost every day. He wrote: ""Everything you type on a typewriter sounds grand, the words forming in mini-explosions of SHOOK SHOOK SHOOK. A thank-you note resonates with the same heft as a literary masterpiece."" Maybe so. ""Sarah, thanks for being my beautiful maid of honor on such a special day for me and Brad. I'm sorry you threw up in the hotel lobby."" And maybe not. Now, for what it's worth, this column was crafted (ha!) over the span of two days using two different computers. During that time, I paused to read more of Hanks' op-ed. And, despite my earlier cynicism, I admit that I now better understand the appeal. Dammit, Tom Hanks. Why do you have to be so charming? So, yeah, I'm sort of sold on the idea that an old typewriter might tap into your creativity in a different way. Which is why they put a lot of thought into making this app. Pulling from Hanks' vast personal collection, the app's developer, Hitcents, created several totally original vintage-style typewriter choices. One of these comes standard with the app. The others are available for purchase. And each types with a completely different style. With the help of Hanks, they literally studied the ink patterns of these old typewriters, and digitally recreated the typefaces within the app. Thus, if you're not working on anything too serious as a final draft, and if you want to explore your creativity and communication in a different, perhaps even more personal, way, the Hanx Writer might just be the app for you. Maybe so. ""Sarah, we just got a bill from the hotel."" And maybe not. Follow @JarrettBellini on Twitter.

"House Speaker John Boehner said Rep. Darrell Issa was justified in ending an acrimonious hearing on IRS targeting of conservative groups -- a meeting concluded when Issa cut the hearing room microphones with his harshest critic on the panel, Rep. Elijah Cummings, in mid sentence. ""From what I understand, I think Mr. Issa was in his rights to adjourn the hearing,"" Boehner told reporters on Thursday. The Congressional Black Caucus wants Issa removed as House Oversight Committee chairman following Wednesday's uproar, which it sees as the latest in a series of disrespectful responses to pushback from Democrats during hearings on the IRS matter. The group offered a resolution on Thursday. ""Chairman Issa's abusive behavior on March 5th is part of a continuing pattern in which he has routinely excluded members of the committee from investigative meetings and has routinely provided information to the  press before  sharing it with committee members,"" Congressional Black Caucus Chairman Rep. Marcia Fudge said. The organization also sent Boehner a letter. ""The abuse of authority and misuse of the congressional privileges afforded them are an affront to the expectations of the American public. Congressman Darrell Issa of California abused his authority and therefore must be reprimanded to ensure the dignity of the House of Representatives is preserved,"" Fudge, an Ohio Democrat, wrote. ""We urge you to take prompt action to maintain the integrity of this body and remove Mr. Issa as chair of the Oversight & Government Reform Committee immediately,"" the letter continued. Tensions are strained between Democrats and Republicans as the two sides continue to probe whether the IRS intentionally targeted conservative groups seeking tax exempt status. The issue flared anew this week following a series of hearings last year around the oversight panel's investigation. Issa: GOP-led IRS targeting probe may be at 'dead end' Republicans see former IRS official Lois Lerner's decision to invoke her constitutional rights not to testify at hearings as obstructionist. Democrats believe their GOP colleagues are trying to squeeze any kind of political capital they can out of an embarrassing episode for the Obama administration in a midterm election year. Those frustrations boiled over on Wednesday when Issa refused to take Cummings' statement and muted his microphone when he protested an early end to the hearing during which Lerner again refused to testify. Cummings, a Maryland Democrat, says he knows a thing or two about respect. ""Let me tell you something. I've been practicing law for 30, 40 years. And, so you see these kind of things,"" Cummings said after the hearing Wednesday. ""But the thing that we are determined is not to be detracted, to get to the truth. And so I see it as a distraction. I don't worry about disrespect, okay?"" On Thursday, Cummings elaborated on why he felt Issa's actions were troubling. ""This is not the first time chairman Issa has shut mics down. You can't shut out the minority voice,"" Cummings said. ""He shut me down because he didn't want to hear what I was saying or what he thought what I was saying. That's un-American."" Cummings told CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront"" that he talked briefly with Issa on Thursday and said he doesn't ""expect him to apologize."" Other Democratic lawmakers were similarly upset. ""What happened was so outrageous, so demeaning, so unjudicial, so awful in every respect, that we just absolutely have actually reached the boiling point,"" said Rep. Louis Slaughter or New York and the top Democrat on the Rules Committee. Issa defended his actions. ""He was talking into a mic in an adjourned meeting. The fact is Mr. Cummings came to make a point of his objections to the process we'd been going through. He was, he was actually slandering me at the moment that the mics did go off by claiming that this had not been a real investigation,"" Issa said Wednesday. ""This had been a bipartisan investigation by multiple committees in which we had testimony in multiple hearings ... in which it was very clear there was targeting of conservative groups in which there were people who were acting outside the norm. We're going to continue our investigation.  But just because Mr. Cummings would like to have a more convenient truth doesn't give him the right to make a speech."" Issa has also indicated that the probe may be approaching a ""dead end"" after nearly a year. ""It may well be that we have gotten to the bottom of it,"" Issa said. Such uncertainty raises questions about whether Republicans who have alleged the targeting order came from political higher-ups, even the White House, can win a legal battle to compel Lerner to provide testimony.","Rep.

"Britain and international Olympic officials are taking issue with an advertisement claiming Argentina has sovereignty over the Falkland Islands. The advertisement shows  Argentine field hockey star Fernando Zylberberg training in the streets of Port Stanley in the Falklands, a UK territory in the South Atlantic. The video ends with the slogan: ""To compete on English soil, we train on Argentine soil."" The Argentine advertisement brought attention to the country's athletes training for the upcoming Olympic Games in London, and the video makes a statement about the war over the Falklands. Argentina has long claimed sovereignty over the islands it calls Las Malvinas. Last month marked the 30-year anniversary of the start of the war. The Falklands have been under British rule since 1833. Britain won the 74-day war that began with an Argentine invasion attempt, but Argentina still presses claims to the islands, which are home to more than 3,000 people. ""We are saddened at this attempt by Argentina to exploit the Games,"" the British Foreign Office said. ""The Olympics is about sport and not politics. The people of the Falklands are British and have chosen to be so. They remain free to choose their own futures both politically and economically and have a right to self-determination. There are three parties to this debate, not just two as Argentina likes to pretend. The islanders just can't be written out of history."" The International Olympic Committee said the Games shouldn't be a ""a forum to raise political issues and the IOC regrets any attempt to use the spotlight of the Games for that end."" ""We are in contact with the Argentine NOC (National Olympic Committee) on a regular basis and we have been reassured on a number of occasions that the NOC will not seek to use the Games as a political platform and will fully respect the Olympic Charter. The IOC has always striven to separate sport from politics and honor the spirit of the Games and all those who take part,"" the IOC said. The production company that filmed the controversial commercial issued a statement Friday saying it ""strongly"" condemned the work and asked the Argentine government to pull the spot. The firm, Y&R, also apologized ""to the many who have been rightly disturbed by it, as have we,"" the company said. ""Furthermore it is against our policy to be involved in anything that is politically motivated. In addition, this spot was also offensive to the Olympics spirit. Whatever it was the creators set out to highlight, what they produced is contrary to everything that we as a company stand for."" Ian Hansen, a member of Falkland Islands' Legislative Assembly, also criticized the advertisement. ""This video was filmed without the knowledge of the Falkland Islands authorities,"" Hansen said. ""We determine our own future, and we will not be bullied by the Argentine government, neither by their attempts to undermine our economy, nor by their constant misrepresentation of the truth."" An article in  Argentine state media agency Telam called the advertisement ""impressive."" The advertisement was ""far from any military connotation, and is part of the national government policies towards the Malvinas, to continue to claim sovereignty by peaceful means,"" the article said.","""This spot was also offensive to the Olympics spirit,"" Y&R says .

"(CNN) -- Former Portugal and Real Madrid coach Carlos Queiroz has been handed the challenge of reviving Iran as an Asian soccer superpower and clinching qualification for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. The 58-year-old, best known for his time at Manchester United where he helped the English club win the European Champions League and three domestic titles as an assistant coach, arrived in Tehran on Monday to sign a three-year contract. He is the first non-Iranian to be appointed since Croatia's Branko Ivankovic ended his second stint after the 2006 World Cup. Queiroz had agreed to take the job in February but then changed his mind due to family reasons, the official IRNA news agency reported. Marvelous Mourinho record falls -- but will it ever be beaten? He had been without a job since September, when he was sacked by Portugal after a row with anti-doping officials before the 2010 World Cup. He was banned for six months, but the Court of Arbitration for Sport subsequently overturned that ruling last month despite agreeing that his behavior was unacceptable. Queiroz was criticized by Portuguese media after the national team needed to go to a playoff to qualify for the World Cup in South Africa, where his side lost in the second round to neighbors and eventual champions Spain. He takes over an Iran team which lost in the quarterfinals of the Asian Cup in January under Iran-born U.S. national Afshin Ghotbi, who before the tournament agreed a deal to join Japanese club S Pulse afterwards. The Iranians -- known as ""Team Melli"" -- begin their campaign to qualify for the 2014 event against the Maldives in July, having failed to win a place among the world's top 32 nations in South Africa. ""I am here in Iran to help the team make it to the 2014 World Cup. This is my most important aim and I hope with everyone's help we can make it,"" Queiroz said after signing his contract live on state television, according to ISNA. ""I know about expectations. One thing I can tell you is that everyone thinks that they can reach the four and win the World Cup. But let's be realistic. How many have won the World Cup? We need to plan for the near, mid and long terms."" Queiroz will earn a salary of about $2 million a year, according to the website of Iran's English language Press TV channel, as he seeks to restore the fortunes of a nation which won the Asian Cup three times in a row from 1968 and qualified for the World Cup for the third time in 2006. ""You need to put together talent, organization and order. The better you put them together, the more chances of success,"" he said. ""Everything is open and I need the support of Iranian coaches. Coaching is about adaptation. If you can't adapt, then you cannot work. After working in different places, I have good chances of adapting in Iran. I worked with players from different continents. I dream of working on the moon."" Queiroz first came to prominence as coach of Portugal's national youth teams where he helped uncover future stars such as Luis Figo and Rui Costa, but his first spell in charge of the senior side ended in failure after failing to qualify for Euro '92 and the 1994 World Cup. After an unsuccessful spell as coach of Lisbon's Sporting, he took jobs in the United States, Japan and the United Arab Emirates before being hired by South Africa, but quit after leading the national team to the 2002 World Cup finals. He was taken on by United manager Alex Ferguson and won the English Premier League title in his first season at Old Trafford before becoming the main man at Spanish giants Real Madrid.. Queiroz lasted only a season of his two-year contract after failing to win a major trophy with a squad featuring the likes of Figo, Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo and David Beckham -- who also moved from United in 2003. He went back to Old Trafford to rejoin Ferguson in 2004, where further success saw him given the Portugal job again in 2008 on a four-year contract.","Carlos Queiroz signs three-year contract to take charge of Iran's national team .

"CNN senior international correspondent Nick Paton Walsh has won an Emmy award for outstanding writing for his reports filed from Syria and Afghanistan. The award-winning reports were ""Aleppo Airstrikes,"" ""Aleppo: Old City Fight,"" and ""Afghan Women Self-Immolation."" In its submission to the Annual News and Documentary Emmy Awards, CNN highlighted Paton Walsh's ""poetic writing,"" saying it contrasted ""with the sobering environments from which his stories are usually drawn."" ""His reports punch through the daily accounts of wounded and dead, and give us a fresh way to see the grinding pitilessness of war, and its quirky inconsistencies,"" the broadcaster said. ""Aleppo Airstrikes"" is the account of indiscriminate shelling in the Syrian city of Aleppo. Walsh's piece to camera sees him crouching as a government bomber jet flies above. ""It's that sound that terrifies ordinary residents of Aleppo daily,"" he says. Of the lone infant who survives the strike, Paton Walsh observes: ""A year old, he was born into Syria's bloody revolution, and may yet survive it still."" In ""Aleppo: Old City Fight,"" Paton Walsh goes right inside the fight for the historic old city. His report focuses on the improvised nature of the battle, with ""pot-shots at nothing in particular"" and what it could mean for the wider conflict. CNN said Paton Walsh's war reporting was ""complemented by his sensitive stories about the plight of women in the developing world."" In ""Afghan Women Self-Immolation,"" the correspondent reports on an epidemic of self-immolation among young married women in Herat. The women take the drastic measure as a form of protest against the abuse they suffer at the hands of their husbands or in-laws. CNN said Paton Walsh's ""delicate writing has a reverential tone, bestowing upon these sad burn victims in Herat the respect they seek."" Beirut-based Paton Walsh has worked for CNN since 2011, focusing on the Middle East, Afghanistan and surrounding region. He topped five other contenders to take home the award for outstanding writing at the awards ceremony, which was held in New York, Tuesday. More recently, Paton Walsh has reported from scenes of conflict in Egypt and Turkey and from Dagestan, where he secured an interview with the parents of the alleged Boston bombers. CNN's Anderson Cooper 360 also won an Emmy, for Outstanding News Discussion and Analysis for ""Kids On Race: The Hidden Picture,"" while CNN's 2012 U.S. election night coverage saw it honored with an Emmy for ""Outstanding Live Coverage of a Current News Story -- Long Form."" Paton Walsh's previous awards include the British Press Awards' Young Journalist of the Year in 2000 and Amnesty International's Gaby Rado Award (2006) for a reporter at the start of their career for his work in the former Soviet Union. He also won Amnesty's television award for his work in Sri Lanka in 2010, while he was working for British broadcaster Channel 4 News. Read more from Nick Paton Walsh: .

"It was a heart-wrenching story. A Mississippi grandmother said she brought her 3-year-old granddaughter into a KFC in Jackson earlier this year. Little Victoria Wilcher had to eat through a feeding tube, her grandmother said, because she had been recently attacked by pit bulls. The girl's face was badly scarred, and she wore an eye patch. The grandmother, Kelly Mullins, said she ordered food -- mashed potatoes -- something the child could more easily swallow. Then she was asked to leave. Victoria's appearance was disturbing other customers. That account, told on the family's Facebook page Victoria's Victories received national media attention, and it enraged many on social media who then contributed money to the family. But Tuesday, KFC said it conducted two investigations, including one by an independent investigator, and neither revealed any proof that the scenario described to reporters and on social media actually occurred, KFC spokesman Rick Maynard said in a statement e-mailed to CNN. The same day, the Victoria's Victories page appeared to have been removed from Facebook. Shortly before it was taken down, this posting appeared: ""I promise its not a hoax, I never thought any of this would blow up the way it has. ...  Please do not believe untrue media. I have personally watched this family go without to provide for Victoria. They have not and would not do anything to hurt Victoria in any way."" Despite CNN's repeated calls Tuesday, neither the family nor the family's attorney could be reached for comment. Donation page suspended . After the family's account became public, donations poured into the family's fund-raising effort at www.gofundme.com. At the time, KFC left an apology on the Facebook page and pledged to donate $30,000 for Victoria's treatment. On Tuesday, the CEO of GoFundMe, Brad Damphousse, said in a statement that the fund-raising webpage was suspending the campaign and offering to refund donations. ""In lieu of the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the 'Victoria's Victories' online fundraising effort, GoFundMe has temporarily suspended the campaign until the full truth is made clear,"" the statement said. Also, the Leader-Call newspaper in Laurel, Mississippi, published a report casting doubt on the family's story, using unnamed sources. ""The sources spoke on the condition of strict anonymity because they were not permitted to speak on the record,"" the newspaper said. Authorities verified to CNN on Tuesday the account of how Victoria came to be injured. Pit bulls attacked the girl in April while she visited her grandfather, from whom Mullins is divorced, authorities said. The dogs bit the girl all over, including her face. She has severe facial scars and lost sight in her right eye and the ability to move the right side of her face, Mullins told CNN affiliate WAPT-TV. The child wears an eye patch with a cartoon character on it. Despite saying it hadn't found proof that one of its restaurants mistreated the girl or her grandmother, KFC is vowing to honor its commitment to donate $30,000 to assist with Victoria's medical bills. ""We hope everyone keeps Victoria in their thoughts and prayers,"" the chain said in a statement. ""She will certainly be in ours.""","KFC says it conducted two investigations into family's allegations of mistreatment .

"The Falkland Islands government announced Tuesday that the British territory will hold a referendum on its political status. The vote is intended to affirm islanders' desire to remain a self-governing territory of the United Kingdom and to reject claims of ownership by nearby Argentina. The Argentine government in recent months has stepped up its rhetoric over the Falklands, saying that the U.K. is exploiting the resources of the islands it calls Las Malvinas. The British defeated Argentina in a 1982 war over the territory. ""We have thought carefully about how to convey a strong message to the outside world that expresses the views of the Falklands people in a clear, democratic and incontestable way,"" said Gavin Short, chairman of the Falklands legislative assembly. ""So we have decided, with the full support of the British government, to hold a referendum on the Falkland Islands to eliminate any possible doubt about our wishes."" The vote will take place in the first half of 2013. The Argentine government did not immediately respond to the announcement. Short accused the Argentine government of misleading rhetoric that implies that there is local support for Argentine rule. ""We certainly have no desire to be ruled by the government in Buenos Aires, a fact that is immediately obvious to anyone who has visited the islands and heard our views,"" he said. This year marks the 30th anniversary of the war. The Falklands have been under British rule since 1833. Britain won the 74-day war that began with an Argentine invasion attempt, but Argentina still presses claims to the islands, which are home to more than 3,000 people. The most recent controversy regarding the Falklands happened last month, when Argentina released a video boosting its Olympic team that was filmed on the islands. The advertisement showed Argentine field hockey star Fernando Zylberberg training in the streets of Port Stanley in the Falklands. The video ends with the slogan: ""To compete on English soil, we train on Argentine soil."" The British government accused Argentina of exploiting the Olympic Games, which will take place in London this year, for political ends. In March, six Nobel Peace Prize laureates wrote a letter to British Prime Minister David Cameron, urging him to hold talks with Argentina on the future of the Falkland Islands. The letter called on Cameron to ""review the British government's position of refusing to dialogue on this matter."" The British government has repeatedly stated its position that the residents of the islands should be the ones to determine their fate. The planned referendum seeks to do just that. ""We are holding this referendum not because we have any doubts about who we are and what future we want, but to show the world just how very certain we are about that,"" Short said.","The Falkland Islands will hold a referendum on its governance .
The vote has the backing of the British government .
Argentina also claims the British-held islands ."
"Two adjacent buildings collapsed Wednesday night in the historic center of Rio de Janeiro, injuring at least four people, Mayor Eduardo Paes told reporters. It was not immediately clear what caused the collapses -- one a 20-story building and the other 10 stories -- nor was the extent of the casualties clear. Paes did not rule out the possibility of a gas leak, but other hypotheses included the possibility of structural failures in the buildings, which were located behind the Municipal Theater. Fire officials said at least four people were injured, according to a post on the city government's Twitter account. CNN affiliate Band News reported 11 people were missing in the collapses, which occurred before 9 p.m. ""I started to hear a crackling. I thought they were gunshots. When I looked up, I saw the top floors falling,"" maintenance worker Julio Cesar de Oliveira Brandao told CNN affiliate TV Record. A fire broke out after the blast, Agencia Brasil said. Police and fire officials were isolating the area and searching for victims, the news agency reported. Cars parked on the street near the buildings were covered in dust, and there was a strong smell of gas in the area, fire officials said, according to the news agency. The lobby of one of the buildings contained a bank branch and a bakery, Agencia Brasil said. Witnesses told Band News that neighboring buildings swayed, as if there had been an earthquake. One witness said many people were inside one of the buildings when it collapsed. The buildings are in a bustling commercial and financial area of Rio de Janeiro. Electrical engineer Jorge Drauss told TV Record he was drinking juice at a nearby diner when he saw small stones falling from the top of one of the buildings.

"With much of the business and financial world waiting nervously for the results of new elections in Greece, young people on the streets of Athens on Thursday sounded more concerned about the hardships the Greek people are facing than the international consequences of their upcoming vote. Clara Kalemi, 18, said her father had been unemployed for two years. ""Finally he got a job but with a very low salary. We can't afford this,"" she said. University student Romans Eksarhos said he and his classmates have little to look forward to. ""We can't do anything; we don't have any hope for our lives,"" he said. ""We know that we are going to finish university, get our degree, maybe our Ph.D., and we are going to work for 300 euros"" a month. That's about $380. A temporary Greek government took office Thursday as the country wrestles with a political crisis that sprang from the country's inability to pay its debts. Greece is heading toward new elections next month, with polls suggesting a narrow victory for a radical leftist party that wants to tear up an international loan agreement which forced the government to make deep budget cuts. That possibility has sent ripples of fear through markets in Europe, Asia and the United States as analysts worry that it could ultimately lead to the collapse of the European Union's currency -- an event an expert predicted Thursday could cost up to $1 trillion. Ratings agency Fitch cut Greece's long-term credit rating from B- to CCC Thursday, only one notch above default level, reflecting worries over its ability to remain in the euro currency zone. ""The downgrade of Greece's sovereign ratings reflects the heightened risk that Greece may not be able to sustain its membership of  Economic and Monetary Union,"" Fitch said. ""In the event that the new general elections scheduled for 17 June fail to produce a government with a mandate to continue with the EU-IMF programme of fiscal austerity and structural reform, an exit of Greece from EMU would be probable."" IMF is the International Monetary Fund . Alexis Tsipras, the leader of the Syriza party, leads in polls ahead of the June 17 election. On Thursday he urged the public to support him. Read Tsipras equate austerity with 'hell' ""People will conquer fear. They will not succumb; they will not be blackmailed,"" he said, accusing the parties that made the international loan agreement of ""irresponsible scare-mongering."" The Centre for Economics Business and Research in London, meanwhile, issued a stark warning Thursday. ""The end of the euro in its current form is certain but will be traumatic,"" predicted the CEBR's Douglas McWilliams. He estimated that the ""immensely painful"" breakdown of the currency used by 17 countries would cost a minimum of $300 million. The European Central Bank said Wednesday it had stopped providing cheap money to some Greek banks after Greeks pulled about 800 million euros ($1 billion) in savings out of the banking system on Monday. It would not say which banks it had cut off, forcing them to turn to the Greek Central Bank for more expensive loans. The Hellenic Hotel Federation, meanwhile, said tourism revenue was plummeting. Hotel reservations have dropped 30% to 50% in different parts of the country, the trade group said. Greek voters punished the major parties at the polls earlier this month for the harsh budget cuts imposed by the country's international lenders. The election left no party able to form a government, creating deep uncertainty about Greece's ability to continue to meet the terms of its bailout package and therefore its debt obligations. The political deadlock is leading to concerns that Greece will not have a functioning government in place when it needs to make critical debt payments next month, which could in turn jeopardize its place in the eurozone, the group of 17 European Union countries that use the euro currency. And a crisis could quickly spread beyond Greece, one analyst warned. ""If Greece exits the euro it won't be alone. Others will exit,"" said Paul Donovan, a global economist with UBS bank. ""There would be bank runs across multiple countries,"" he predicted. ""Citigroup, for example, may not be exposed to Greece, but it may be exposed to Portugal, Spain, France. ... It may be exposed to a company that's exposed to France or exposed to exports to EU."" In a worst-case scenario, he said, ""you're talking about widespread defaults in the corporate sector as well as the sovereign sector. It becomes very problematic."" European leaders were united Wednesday in saying they want to help Greece stay in the euro. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she is working to keep Greece in the eurozone . ""Europe needs to show solidarity and help, particularly with growth, unemployment and development,"" she said. Merkel, a champion of forcing governments to balance their budgets in order to promote stable economic growth in Europe, said she regrets the suffering of the Greek people in the face of harsh government budget cuts. ""It's very bitter, obviously,"" she said of the austerity measures that have left some Greeks struggling to pay for food or utilities. But, she said, ""Sacrifices had to be made. ... I think these are necessary measures that had to be taken."" The European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund have been pumping money into Greece to keep the country in the euro and able to pay its debts, but they have demanded that the Greek government slash spending to get the funds.","Ratings agency Fitch downgrades Greece's long-term credit rating .

"On a political level, it was a powerful Middle East nation playing host to a people whose cause it supports. As a sporting contest, it was a one-way procession as Iran's national football team warmed up for next week's World Cup qualifier with a 7-0 thrashing of an under-strength Palestine side. Iran's rulers support Palestine's claims for statehood on the condition that Israel is dissolved -- a ""cancer cell"" that needs to be removed, according to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad -- and Wednesday's friendly match in Tehran highlighted some of the difficulties the Palestinians face. The team traveled to Iran soon after Tehran hosted a five-day international conference in support of Palestine intifada -- or uprising -- attended by its Arab and other Islamic allies. They arrived at Azadi Stadium without any players who hold Israeli documents -- a significant chunk of the squad -- and predictably struggled to hold off an Iran side featuring some of Asian football's biggest names. Having kept the match scoreless until first-half injury-time, a headed goal from Mohammad Ghazi opened the floodgates and six more followed after the interval. Karim Ansarifard, Javad Nekounam (with a penalty), Javad Kazemian, Pejman Montazeri and Pejman Nouri made it 6-0. Kazemian completed the rout at the end with another penalty after Palestine's goalkeeper was sent off for a second booking. An American soccer star playing for Palestine . The match will not count in FIFA's world rankings, as Iran coach Carlos Queiroz brought on a seventh substitute -- one more than is allowed for ""A"" internationals. But it was one more step for the Palestinians, who hosted their first competitive home match in March. The team lost in the second round of Asian qualifying matches for the 2012 Olympics, and also in the second round of regional qualifiers for the 2014 World Cup. Iran, by contrast, is top of Group E in the third round ahead of second-placed Bahrain's visit to Tehran on Tuesday. ""The Palestinians have long used football to form an idea of a nation,"" Middle East football expert James Montague told CNN. ""FIFA are one of the few organizations to have recognized an entity called Palestine, and their mere existence is a chance to fly the flag abroad. ""The fact that the head of the FA is a man called Jibril Rajoub, Yasser Arafat's national security adviser and one of the highest-ranked men in Fatah, tells you that they take the team -- and the power that football has to invoke national unity and foreign propaganda -- very seriously indeed."" Montague, author of the book ""When Friday Comes: Football in the War Zone,"" said the friendly match gave Ahmadinejad a chance to show his support for Palestine's cause. ""He has often used football for political ends, like before the 2006 World Cup when he used the team's popularity to boost his dwindling support,"" Montague said. ""But it can backfire. The terraces in Iran have also become a crucible for opposition to unpopular policies in a country with very few outlets for dissent. ""Palestine are on the up. After years of a debilitating Israeli occupation, they now have a pro league, a women's team and a national squad that came close to qualifying for the group stage of Asian qualification for the 2014 World Cup. ""Iran's golden generation has passed, but under Carlos Queiroz they hope to return to the glory days when they made it to France '98 and famously put Team USA to the sword.""","Palestine beaten 7-0 by Iran in friendly match in Tehran on Wednesday .

"Ken Weatherwax, who played Pugsley on the 1960s TV show ""The Addams Family,"" died Sunday, according to the Ventura County Coroner's Office. He was 59. According to the coroner's office, he died of natural causes. His niece, Shanyn Vieira, posted on Facebook that he had a heart attack. Pugsley was the older of the two Addams children on the cheekily macabre comedy, based on Charles Addams' darkly humored New Yorker cartoons. His father, Gomez, was played by John Astin, and mother Morticia was played by Carolyn Jones. Sister Wednesday (Lisa Loring), Uncle Fester (Jackie Coogan), butler Lurch (Ted Cassidy), Grandmama (Blossom Rock) and the disembodied hand Thing rounded out the cast. The series ran from 1964 to 1966. Weatherwax, who was about 9 when the show started, played the part for all 64 episodes. The show (and its catchy, finger-snapping theme song) were popular enough in reruns to spawn two movies in the 1990s and a 2009 Broadway musical. After the show left the air, Weatherwax -- who struggled to find other acting roles -- entered the Army. He later provided the voice of Pugsley on an animated ""Addams Family"" and worked as a grip and set builder in Hollywood, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Weatherwax was related to other showbiz figures, including actress Ruby Keeler and Lassie trainer Rudd Weatherwax.

"Chiquita Chavis is an Army Reservist who served in Afghanistan and is waiting to see if she'll be deployed for a second time. But since returning from her first tour in 2010, she has fallen on hard times. She came back to find that the civilian job she left had been restructured, and with only part-time work, she struggled to make ends meet for herself and her young daughter. They ended up living in a friend's garage. ""I never had to live in the street,"" said Chavis, 30. ""But I (was) not in a situation where I could support myself on my own."" Chavis is not alone. While the Department of Veterans Affairs reports that overall veteran homeless rates are going down, female rates are going up. In fact, female veterans are the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. homeless population and are more at risk than their male counterparts, according to the report. Read the report on veterans' homeless rates (PDF) The VA says veterans become homeless for many reasons, including mental health issues and substance abuse. But it notes that female veterans can face additional challenges, such as sexual abuse. Female veterans are also more likely to be single parents, the VA says, which can make it more difficult to find adequate housing. Chavis' luck changed at a job fair when she met Jaspen Boothe, a captain with the Army National Guard. Within days, Boothe had helped Chavis and her daughter move to a transitional home where they could stay until they got back on their feet. Boothe, 35, considers it her mission to help her female comrades who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless. Since 2011, she has provided transitional housing or financial assistance to more than 50 female veterans and their children through her nonprofit, Final Salute. ""Not every veteran is living under a bridge,"" Boothe said. ""Not all veterans have mental issues. Not all veterans have experienced substance abuse. Some veterans have just fallen on hard times."" When they do fall, it can be hard for female veterans with children to find housing, according to the Government Accountability Office. It reported that 60% of the homeless shelters that serve female veterans don't accept children or have restrictions based on age or the number of children that can be housed. Read the GAO report on veterans and housing (PDF) In the past two years, Boothe has opened two transitional homes in the Virginia suburbs of Washington, where veterans and their children can live for up to two years while they get their lives back on track. Her nonprofit also offers them assistance with child care, employment placement and accessing benefits or counseling through the VA. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2013 CNN Heroes . ""We offer wrap-around services ... anything they could possibly need to help get themselves back in a state of independence,"" Boothe said. ""We give all the tools that you need, but your success in this program is up to you."" Additionally, Boothe works to prevent homelessness by providing interest-free loans or grants to help female veterans pay for rent, deposit and utilities. To date, she's helped 100 women and children through her programs, and she has given plenty of personal support and encouragement along the way. ""I definitely am someone who relates to them on their level,"" she said. ""(I) let them know: ""Hey, you can get past your circumstances. They're only temporary."" She should know; she was once homeless herself. As a single mother, Boothe joined the Army Reserves to make a better life for herself and her young son. She was based in New Orleans and set to deploy to Iraq in 2005 when her life was turned upside down. Hurricane Katrina hit. Boothe and her son were fine -- she'd already sent him to live with a relative in Missouri while she prepared to deploy -- but the family lost everything, and Boothe became homeless. A month later, she was diagnosed with head, neck and throat cancer. She underwent surgery and radiation treatment at Brooke Army Medical Center in Texas, but she was eventually discharged from the Reserves because of her illness. When Boothe asked the VA what assistance was available for her, she was told they didn't have any programs that could help with the challenges she was facing as a female veteran with a dependent child. They referred her to local social services, which Boothe called probably the most demeaning experience of her life. ""You're treated basically as a baby's mama or a crack head, or some woman who's made a bunch of bad decisions with her life, and the only resources available were welfare,"" Boothe said. ""I'm not a welfare mom, I'm a soldier."" Boothe joined her young son in Missouri, where she was able to eventually get her life back together. Today, her cancer is in remission, and she lives with her son, her new husband and their son in Virginia, where she is on active duty with the Army National Guard. For years, Boothe considered her experience an isolated incident. But when she realized that other female veterans were struggling, too, she decided to take action. For her, it's part of the oath she swore to uphold when she entered the service. ""As a soldier, you raise your right hand, and with that comes certain responsibilities,"" she said. ""One of those is to never leave a fallen comrade. ... So whether they're in or out of uniform, they have me if they need me."" Boothe's help has given Chavis the break she needed. ""I have a job now, and I got promoted in like two weeks,"" Chavis said. ""I'm really at peace here, and I can focus on what my next steps are. ... Jas set me up for success."" Boothe is determined to help as many female veterans as she can. At the end of the month, she'll be getting another opportunity when she starts her dream job: working in women veterans outreach at the VA. One way or another, her ultimate goal is to make organizations like hers obsolete. ""I don't have a blueprint, but I'm going to figure it out,"" she said. ""It's my duty as a soldier to help my fellow sisters."" Want to get involved?

"The fire that engulfed the Porsche carrying actor Paul Walker apparently did not erupt until a minute after the car clipped a light pole Saturday. That conclusion is based on security camera video obtained by CNN that shows black smoke starting to rise from the crash scene 60 seconds after it shows the light pole and a tree falling. Could Walker and the other occupant in the car have made it out in those 60 seconds? That's hard to tell. The two may have died on impact when the car struck the light pole. The answer might be clearer when the coroner's office releases its preliminary findings of the autopsies of the remains of two men -- presumed to be Walker and friend Roger Rodas, a coroner's officer said. The autopsies were completed Tuesday, Los Angeles County Coroner Lt. Fred Corral said. But investigators have placed a ""security hold"" on  it for now. The coroner will not even disclose if the identities have been confirmed using dental X-rays.  Officially, the dead are only identified as case numbers. Corral did not give a reason for the secrecy, which can be requested by law enforcement agencies during an investigation.  It is often done in cases involving criminal probes, but there has been no indication this is anything more than a traffic accident investigation. The autopsies should be able to confirm whether Rodas, as witnesses reported, was behind the wheel with Walker in the passenger seat. Video  obtained by CNN Tuesday from a security camera posted on a building on the opposite side of the street from the crash does not show the Porsche Carerra GT crashing along a business park street in Valencia, California, Saturday afternoon. It does show the light pole and tree falling.  Smoke is faintly visible above the scene 60 seconds later, followed by a heavy plume of black smoke after two minutes. As investigators searched for more information about the accident that killed the popular ""Fast & Furious"" actor on Saturday, one of his co-stars dramatically addressed grieving fans. Using a police car's loudspeaker, actor Vin Diesel thanked a crowd of mourning fans, calling Walker an ""angel up in Heaven."" Every night since the crash fans have gathered and left mementos near the spot on a wide business park road in Valencia, California, about 30 miles north of Hollywood, according to Walker's publicist and CNN affiliate KCAL. Rodas, owner of a high-performance car shop, is believed to have been driving. Both Rodas and Walker were drivers for Rodas' Always Evolving racing team, according to the team's website. By Tuesday Diesel had posted several pictures of his friend on his Facebook page. And earlier this week, another co-star, Tyrese Gibson, broke down sobbing as he laid a yellow flower at the site. ""My heart is hurting so bad no one can make me believe this is real,"" the singer and actor posted on Instagram. He also shared the duo's last text exchange. Walker's father, Paul Walker Sr., choked back tears Monday. ""His heart was so big,"" he told CNN affiliate KCAL. ""I was proud of him every day of his life."" The actor had told his father that he wanted to take a hiatus from acting to spend more time with his 15-year-old daughter, Meadow, the elder Walker said. ""And then boom, he got another movie. He would say, 'I don't know what to do.'"" He said the actor's siblings are having an especially hard time grappling with the death. ""I'm just ... glad that every time I saw him, I told him I loved him,"" the father said. ""And he would say the same thing to me."" The Walker family issued a statement expressing thanks for ""the outpouring of love and goodwill from his many fans and friends."" They asked that instead of flowers, people make donations to his charity, Reach Out Worldwide. The actor was at a benefit for the charity just before he died. ""It's comforting for them to know that the son, brother, and father they love so much is equally adored, respected, and appreciated by so many,"" the statement said. ""Paul founded the organization with the genuine desire to help others, and it's important to his family to keep his memory alive through ROWW."" No memorial service plans have been made, Walker's publicist has said. How fast? Meanwhile a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office probe is focused on the speed of the 2005 Porsche Carrera GT, the spokesman told CNN. Sheriff's Sgt. Richard Cohen told CNN that authorities received a tip Sunday suggesting that another car was at the scene racing the Porsche when it slammed into a light pole and burst into flames. But investigators have since ruled out the presence of a second vehicle and the theory that the Porsche was drag racing, a spokesman said Monday afternoon. But speed was a factor in the crash, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office said.  A 45-mph speed limit sign was attached to the light pole knocked down by the Porsche. The car, which sold for $450,000 when new, is a notoriously difficult vehicle to handle, even for professional drivers, according to Autoweek magazine. A top driver called it ""scary,"" the magazine reported Sunday. It is powered by a V-10, 610-hp engine. The wreck took place about 3:30 p.m. Saturday. Antonio Holmes told the Santa Clarita Valley Signal newspaper that he was at the charity event when Walker and Rodas left for a ride in the Porsche. ""We all heard from our location,"" Holmes told the Signal. ""It's a little difficult to know what it was. Someone called it in and said it was a vehicle fire. We all ran around and jumped in cars and grabbed fire extinguishers and immediately went to the vehicle. It was engulfed in flames. There was nothing. They were trapped. Employees, friends of the shop. We tried. We tried. We went through fire extinguishers."" 5 reasons the car Walker died in is different . Jim Torp, a car enthusiast who was at the charity event, said Walker was smiling as he got into the Porsche minutes earlier. Torp thought he heard a blast in the distance before the car slammed into a light pole, he said. ""What the first explosion was -- I don't know if their tire blew up, because it sounded like a tire blew on the car,"" Torp told CNN Monday. Skid marks on the asphalt near the crash site, which indicate a car was doing doughnut spins, also are being examined, Cohen said. It's not uncommon for people to speed down that street, and two years ago deputies tried to crack down on that, he said. Torp told CNN that he looked closely at the skid marks and concluded they were left by a car with smaller tires. Remarkable generosity . There are tales of Walker's incredible generosity. CNN confirmed one story from a decade ago when Walker noticed a young U.S. soldier shopping with his fiancee for a wedding ring in a Santa Barbara jewelry store. ""The groom was just back from duty in Iraq, and he was going to be deployed again soon and wanted to buy a wedding ring, but he said he just could not afford it,"" saleswoman Irene King told CNN. ""I don't think the soldier realized how expensive those rings are, about $10,000."" The couple apparently did not know who Walker was, King said. ""Walker called the manager over and said, 'Put that girl's ring on my tab,'"" she said. ""Walker left all his billing info, and it was a done deal. The couple was stunned. She was thrilled and could not believe someone did this."" King called it ""the most generous thing I have ever seen."" The day Walker died he was at a holiday toy drive for Walker's charity hosted by the store that Rodas owned. Walker and Rodas had planned Saturday as a day to help survivors of Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines. The car shop website invited customers to a ""Charity Toy Drive & Automotive Social Gathering."" ""During the holiday season, many economically disadvantaged children from around the world are faced with the same dilemma year after year; the lacking of joy and cheer,"" the invitation read. ""Our goal here is to be able to provide aid to these less fortunate children in hopes of helping them grow up to become confident, responsible and productive young adults."" Box office success . Walker's career began on the small screen, first with a commercial for Pampers when he was 2, and then with parts in shows such as ""Highway to Heaven"" and ""Touched by an Angel."" His first few movie roles were as supporting characters in teen flicks, most notably in ""Varsity Blues."" But his career really took off when he was cast as undercover cop Brian O'Conner infiltrating a street-racing gang in 2001's ""The Fast and the Furious."" The box-office success of the surprise summer hit yielded numerous sequels.  And along with Vin Diesel, Walker was one of the franchise stalwarts. The six ""Fast & Furious"" films sold a total of $2.6 billion in tickets worldwide, according to BoxOfficeMojo. Walker wasn't just a car enthusiast on the silver screen; off screen, the actor competed in the Redline Time Attack racing series. On his verified Twitter account, Walker described himself as an ""outdoorsman, ocean addict, adrenaline junkie ... and I do some acting on the side."" Walker also is the star of ""Hours,"" an independent film scheduled to be released December 13 about a father struggling to keep his newborn infant alive in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. People we lost in 2013 . Future of franchise . Walker was in the middle of the seventh film in the ""Fast & Furious"" franchise. The film was due out next year. It's unclear how the movie's production might proceed. When Oliver Reed died in the middle of the production of ""Gladiator,"" the rest of his scenes included a digitally produced image of his face on another actor's body, Tom O'Neil, editor of the show business website Goldderby.com, told CNN. In some cases, other actors have filled in for co-stars who have passed away. ""We don't know what they'll do here, or even if they'll just say, ""It may be tasteless to proceed at all because we can't be showing Paul Walker in a speeding car, defying death in a movie that ended up being the way he died,'"" O'Neil said.

"(CNN) -- Enietra Washington doesn't remember the flash or the bang when she was shot. All she recalls is a stunned silence in the orange Ford Pinto, driven by the man who'd offered her a ride to a party. The bullet that doctors pulled from her body in 1988 became a key piece of evidence against the man now suspected of being the ""Grim Sleeper"" serial killer, blamed for the deaths of at least 10 women in the Los Angeles area between 1985 and 2007. The .25-caliber slug matched a weapon police now link to eight of those killings, which detectives say were committed by 58-year-old Lonnie David Franklin Jr. Washington is the only known survivor of an encounter with the Grim Sleeper, whose nickname comes from a 13-year gap between slayings police blamed on him. But now, investigators are looking into whether Franklin can be connected to any more of another 230 Los Angeles-area slayings, including some they previously considered solved. Washington told HLN's ""Issues with Jane Velez-Mitchell"" that her attacker turned on her so quickly she hardly knew what happened. ""He does it unexpectedly,"" she said. ""It's not like the woman is forewarned and can even protect herself. If she's not paying attention just as I was, you turn around to say something to him and he point-blank shoots you first. ""If you're not in the grace of God and you know how to keep yourself from panicking, you're at his will,"" she said. Washington, then 29, said she was drawn to the orange Pinto with the striped top. When its driver offered her a ride, she turned him down, only to have him retort, ""That's what's wrong with you black women. Men can't be men to you,"" she recounted. She agreed to accept a ride to a gathering at a friend's house, thinking she could pawn him off on someone there. After he stopped at what he said was his uncle's house to get cash, she said he muttered something she didn't quite hear -- ""then all of a sudden, everything just went real quiet."" Only when her attacker told her, ""Bitch, I'll shoot you again,"" did she realize she had been shot a first time, she told HLN. Most of the sleeper's victims were discovered dumped in south Los Angeles alleys and covered with debris, authorities said. All victims were shot; some were strangled too, an indictment alleges. Prosecutors have said they will seek the death penalty against Franklin, who was arrested in July 2010. A pretrial hearing is scheduled for November 7, according to the district attorney's office.","Enietra Washington is the only known survivor of the ""Grim Sleeper"" killer .

"Ikenna Nzeribe was the sole survivor after assassins from Boko Haram stormed his Nigerian church in 2012, just 60 miles from where the jihadists last month abducted more than 200 girls. The church massacre remains vivid for Nzeribe three years later -- as are the scars on his face, neck and arm. The Muslim extremists fired shots into the air and shouted ""Allah Hu Akbar,"" or God is great. Nzeribe and 13 other Christians hit the floor. They were mourning how Boko Haram earlier had killed three fellow Christians, but now Boko Haram was coming for them. The masked gunmen shot the 13 worshippers in the head, fatally. Now it was Nzeribe's turn. ""As soon as I saw the man, I knew it was over for me,"" Nzeribe, 33, said about the gunman. ""The only thing I could do was say a last prayer, which was 'Blood of Jesus cover me.' ""And that was it for me,"" he told CNN. Nzeribe, a handsome banker, was shot in the face with an AK-47 assault rifle, blowing away his jaw, lips and part of his tongue. He faked death -- ""until they finished,"" he said. He bled profusely. ""I would say I died in the process,"" Nzeribe added. ""But God brought me back to life."" Rescuers took him to a local hospital in Mubi, a suburban area in northeastern Nigeria where he was part of a Christian minority and where the mass shooting in church occurred. He was later flown to London, where surgeons reconstructed his face. Nzeribe recalled looking in the mirror for the first time post-surgery. What he saw was ""a very different person,"" Nzeribe said, shaking his head. He stopped the interview, wiping away the tears and finding composure after long breaths. A zigzagging scar runs up Nzeribe's chin to his upper lip. His mouth is even more disfigured, but at least he can talk, in soft tones. And he has a great laugh, though he can't smile. He's had more than a dozen surgeries, with more pending. He's now recovering in Houston, where he receives treatment and lives with his wife and their baby, joining a Nigerian immigrant community whose residents find the climate similar to their native country's. His attorney, Frank C. Onyenezi, is working on Nzeribe's immigration status. ""We've come a long way,"" Nzeribe said of his surgeries and reconstructed face. He's flattered to hear how he appears younger. ""It gives me confidence,"" he said of his surgically reconstructed face. ""It gives me hope."" A devout Christian whose tale has been publicized in the religious press, he said has forgiven the gunmen of Boko Haram, whose mass abduction of Nigerian schoolgirls has outraged the international community. ""The first thing I did was to forgive them,"" Nzeribe said. ""Had they known better, they couldn't do that."" But Nzeribe isn't naïve: He is warning the world about how Boko Haram and its leader, Abubakar Shekau, commit atrocities with impunity. ""Everything he says he will do, he does them,"" Nzeribe said. ""It gives them a sense of fulfillment and makes them want to do more. ""Just like al Qaeda, they are very, very destructive,"" he added. He now prays for the kidnapped 276 girls, still missing in Nigeria. Nigerian girl escapes Boko Haram .","Ikenna Nzeribe is shot in the face with an AK-47 by Boko Haram gunmen in 2012 .

"After the firestorm over Edward Snowden's disclosure of U.S. surveillance programs, the most contentious aspect revealed by last year's classified leaks will continue under reforms announced Friday by President Barack Obama. Someone will still collect records of the numbers and times of phone calls by every American. While access to the those records will be tightened and they may be shifted from the National Security Agency to elsewhere, the storage of the phone metadata goes on. For that reason, civil libertarians, members of Congress and others complained that Obama failed to go far enough in what his administration labeled as the most comprehensive intelligence-gathering reforms since he took office in 2009. In his 45-minute speech at the Justice Department, Obama unveiled new guidance for intelligence-gathering as well as reforms intended to balance what he called the nation's vital security needs with concerns over privacy and civil liberties. By making the changes after a review he ordered following the Snowden disclosures, Obama put his signature on the U.S. intelligence operation and helped define his legacy as a chief executive who had promised a more open and transparent government when he entered the White House in 2009. He outlined a series of steps -- some immediate and some requiring time to work out, possibly with Congress -- that would change some aspects of the NSA collection of phone records and other information but generally leave intact the core and function of existing programs. Obama also addressed concerns abroad that the United States spies on ordinary people as well as allied leaders. Snowden's disclosures showed U.S. surveillance of personal communications of leaders in Germany, Brazil and other allies. ""The United States is not spying on ordinary people who don't threaten our national security"" Obama said, adding that ""unless there is a compelling national security purpose, we will not monitor the communications of heads of state and government of our close friends and allies."" Obama not dwelling on Snowden . Before Obama spoke, a senior administration official who briefed reporters on condition of not being identified said the President's assurances of no further spying on foreign leaders extended only to ""dozens"" of heads of state and government of U.S. friends and allies. Initial reaction indicated those favoring robust intelligence gathering agreed with the President. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said Obama ""took a measured and thoughtful approach,"" while Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said he supported the reforms. House Speaker John Boehner warned Obama against allowing politics to ""cloud his judgment"" over maintaining what the Ohio Republican called necessary programs for national security. ""The House will review any legislative reforms proposed by the administration, but we will not erode the operational integrity of critical programs that have helped keep America safe,"" Boehner said in a statement. On the other side, Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky said the speech deserved ""an 'A' for effort and probably a 'C' for content,"" while WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange told CNN that it was  ""embarrassing"" for a head of state to speak so long and ""say almost nothing."" ""Unfortunately, today, what we see is very few concrete reforms,"" said Assange, who noted that Snowden intends to publicly respond to Obama's speech as soon as next week. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent who caucuses with the majority Democrats, called Obama's speech an first step in a necessary dialogue on balancing security needs with privacy rights in the digital age. ""The devil is going to be in the details,"" Sanders said, adding that the discussion will continue for years as technological capabilities expand. Obama: Intel has helped us . Obama's changes to the controversial NSA telephone bulk collection program disclosed by Snowden require intelligence analysts to get approval from the Federal Intelligence Surveillance  Court to go into the metadata stored by the agency. Today, the NSA determines when analysts can examine the metadata, a senior administration official told reporters on condition of not being identified. ""That is no longer an issue that is dealt with solely within the NSA,"" the official said. ""They have to bring it to the FISA court."" In addition, Obama said he ordered Attorney General Eric Holder to work with intelligence officials on finding another place to store the metadata records that include phone numbers and the length of calls, but not content. Obama also called on Congress to authorize establishment of a new panel of outside advocates to participate in ""significant cases"" before the secret FISA courts that handle intelligence collection issues. Another step extended U.S. legal protections involving surveillance to foreign nationals, noted CNN Chief National Security Correspondent Jim Sciutto, who called the President's speech extraordinary in one way for publicly addressing what had been top-secret programs seven months ago. However, Sciutto noted Obama's reforms made no mention of losses by U.S. technology businesses around the world due to concerns that customers would be spied on under the programs disclosed by Snowden's leaks. Some critics on both sides of the political aisle contend collection of such vast amounts of information violates personal privacy. Democratic Sens. Patrick Leahy of Vermont and Tom Udall of New Mexico said they intend to continue pushing legislation to limit the metadata collection beyond what Obama proposes. Republican Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan said that ""Congress must do what the President apparently will not: end the unconstitutional violation of Americans' privacy, stop the suspicionless surveillance of our people, and close the era of secret law."" In his speech, Obama argued that national security depended on access to such data as long as it was under proper control and regulation. Read Obama's remarks . ""No evidence of abuse has been found involving surveillance programs, but changes are needed in response to legitimate privacy concerns that have been raised, Obama said. The new guidance he issued declared the United States will not collect intelligence ""for the purpose of suppressing or burdening criticism or dissent, or for disadvantaging persons based on their ethnicity, race, gender, sexual orientation, or religion."" Offering a historical review of U.S. intelligence gathering, Obama recalled events in American history going back to Paul Revere's famous ride. The 9/11 terrorist attacks raised the profile and priority of U.S. intelligence efforts, the President said, and now technological advances that allow supercomputers to gather huge amounts of digital data have complicated efforts ""to both defend our nation and uphold our civil liberties."" Obama and the bottom line . Obama remained critical of Snowden, who is now living under asylum in Russia, following his series of leaks that began last June and transformed the debate on national security surveillance in the post 9/11 era. ""Our nation's defense depends in part on the fidelity of those entrusted with our nation's secrets,"" Obama said. ""If any individual who objects to government policy can take it in their own hands to publicly disclose classified information, then we will never be able to keep our people safe, or conduct foreign policy."" While the bulk telephone data remains with the NSA for now, Obama wants those records moved out of government hands, though it is uncertain where, a senior administration official said in briefing reporters on condition of not being identified. Federal courts are divided on NSA telephone data collection. One judge in Washington ruled  preliminarily in December that it was probably unconstitutional on privacy grounds. A second judge ruling in another case in New York subsequently found it lawful.","House Speaker John Boehner says any changes can't harm national security .

"A University of California San Diego student left unmonitored in a holding cell for five days by the Drug Enforcement Administration has settled a lawsuit for $4.1 million, his attorney said. ""This was a mistake of unbelievable and unimaginable proportions,"" attorney Julia Yoo said on Tuesday. Daniel Chong, 25, drank his own urine to survive and even wrote a farewell note to his mother before authorities discovered him severely dehydrated after a 2012 drug raid in San Diego. He was held in a 5-by-10-foot cell with no windows but a peephole through the door. It had thick concrete walls and was situated in a narrow hallway with four other cells, isolated from the rest of the DEA facility, said Eugene Iredale, another of Chong's attorneys. There was no toilet, only a metal bench on which he stood in a futile attempt to set off the sprinkler system with his cuffed hands, Chong told CNN affiliate KSWB. He kicked the door and yelled, anything to get someone's attention, the station reported. ""I was screaming. I was completely insane,"" he told KWSB. One matter still unclear is why no one heard him. Chong told the San Diego Union-Tribune last year that he heard footsteps, muffled voices and the opening and closing of cell doors, even from the cell adjacent to his. Yet no one responded to the ruckus coming from inside his cell. Chong was detained on the morning of April 21, 2012, when DEA agents raided a house they suspected was being used to distribute MDMA, commonly known as ""ecstasy."" A multiagency narcotics task force, including state agents, detained nine people and seized about 18,000 ecstasy pills, marijuana, prescription medications, hallucinogenic mushrooms, several guns and thousands of rounds of ammunition from the house, according to the DEA. It wasn't until the afternoon of Wednesday, April 25, that an agent opened the steel door to Chong's cell and found the handcuffed student, Iredale said last year. Upon his release, Mr. Chong told CNN affiliate KNSD that he was visiting a friend and knew nothing about the presence of drugs and guns. He was never formally arrested or charged, the DEA said. While detained, Chong had given up and accepted death, using a shard of glass from his glasses to carve ""Sorry Mom"" onto his arm as a farewell message, Yoo said. Chong lost 15 pounds and suffered from severe post-traumatic stress disorder, she said. ""He's the strongest person I have ever met,"" Yoo said. ""As a result of his case, it's one of the primary reasons the DEA placed a nationwide policy that calls on each agent at satellite offices to check on the well-being of prisoners in their cells on a daily basis,"" Yoo said. A DEA spokeswoman declined to comment extensively about the settlement and told CNN that a review of DEA procedures was conducted and submitted to the inspector general's office at the Department of Justice. She also referred CNN to a previous statement. ""I am deeply troubled by the incident that occurred here,"" said DEA San Diego Special Agent in Charge William R. Sherman shortly after the incident. ""I extend my deepest apologies to the young man and want to express that this event is not indicative of the high standards that I hold my employees to."" Since the incident, Chong has returned to complete his undergraduate degree at UC San Diego, Yoo said. ""He changed his major from engineering to economics and wants to finish school, pursue his career and help take care of his mother.""","""I was screaming. I was completely insane,"" student tells station .

"The gun used in an assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II is to be displayed in the late pontiff's childhood home in Poland, ahead of his expected canonization next month. Italy's Justice Ministry has loaned the weapon, a Browning 9mm, to the John Paul II Museum in his hometown, Wadowice, for three years. ""It is a dark, dark object,"" the museum's director, Reverend Darius Ras, told CNN. ""But it is important for the historical memory of events in the life of John Paul II."" Would-be assassin Mehmet Ali Agca used the firearm to shoot the then-Pope in the abdomen, arm and hand, as he was driven through St Peter's Square, Rome on May 13, 1981. Pope John Paul II suffered life-threatening injuries in the attack, but recovered after undergoing major surgery; he later forgave Agca after meeting him in prison. Agca, who has never fully explained the reasons behind his attempt to kill John Paul II, was jailed for life; he was pardoned in 2000 after almost 20 years behind bars, and deported back to Turkey. The gun, which is being taken to Poland by Ras, will be one of the key exhibits in the museum's new displays about John Paul's life when it reopens on April 9, 2014. The museum will also show the furniture used in the Pope's room at Rome's Gemelli Hospital, during his final stay there, shortly before his death in 2005. His hospital bed, a chair and side table, along with a sketch of his face, which had been on the wall near his bed, have been kept in storage at the hospital for the past nine years. Pope John Paul II is to be canonized on April 27, 2014, alongside Pope John XXIII.","Gun used in assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II to be displayed in hometown .

"Youth unemployment is not a new subject to make the headlines (see Spain and Greece) but it is has become a particularly acute problem for Jordan. Those aged between 15 and 24 make up a large percentage of the working age population in the Middle East nation of nearly 8 million people and have been particularly hard hit in recent years. According to April figures from Jordan's Department of Statistics, 36.6% of 15-19 year olds and 27.9% of 20-24 years olds in the country are out of work. Events in the surrounding region have hardly helped in this regard. First, the Arab Spring hit investment. Then, the Syrian civil war sparked a refugee crisis. The Jordanian government says approximately 1.2 million Syrians have fled the country and entered into Jordan, many of whom are looking to work and provide for their families. A further 29,000 Iraqi refugees have registered in Jordan, according to the UNHCR, and this number could rise if the ongoing destabilization and march of ISIS continues. CNN's John Defterios sat down with Jordan's labor minister, Nidal Katamine, to discuss the scale of these issues and what measures need to be put in place to tackle them. He began by asking whether the current conditions make it nigh on impossible to decrease unemployment in the medium term. Nidal Katamine (NK): The problem is when you have a sudden increase in population into the country vis-a-vis the refugees we are receiving from Syria and prior to that the economic situation going on via the Arab Spring ... that has increased the foreign labor force in the country. Hence your strategies have to be all the time readjusted. It's very tough to keep or maintain a strategy that would reduce figures in view of this very unusual phenomenon. John Defterios (JD): Is the west or industrialized world not doing enough to assist in this transition because of the Syrian crisis and again the bubbling of the Iraqi crisis? NK: To be frank with you the west is looking into it and trying to do something but in effect they're not really doing enough to support Jordan in this disaster as it were. This is a disaster that is happening in the region and Jordan is taking the thrust of it. We've been trying to reach out to donors and to the rest of the world. We've received a lot of promises and pats on the back but unfortunately we have not really received real support. We're very, very disappointed at this stage. As a minister of labor I made this clear last year to the ILO, the International Labour Organization, and I plead for assistance. Ultimately, you need to help the people on the ground here who require training or who requires to be adjusted within a new society and also not to influence the existing labor society that they are hosted in. JD: If you have nearly one out of four youth unemployed and you have a Syrian refugee or an Iraqi coming in what happens? Do they undercut the existing wages that are there and is this the tension that is on the street. NK: Let me give you an idea of the scale of the problem. Imagine if the whole of Canada just visited the USA. This is how it is now for us vis-a-vis the Syrian refugees alone, let alone the neighboring countries like Egypt ... it is very tough for us. It is affecting our labor force. Unfortunately, those who are living in Jordan as refugees, they are looking for any work that could cover their expenses. Therefore their reduced wages is attracting the labor market and obviously that is definitely influencing the figures in Jordan. JD: The private sector has been complaining for years that they don't like what comes out of the education system, that they have to retrain the workers. Should they stop complaining and be more active at the front line of the challenge? NK: I think in Jordan we have not succeeded in the past to do the proper match. Even the developed world is facing problems. I feel that for example the body that is responsible for unemployment in the rest of the world is always the ministries of labor which should not be the case. Each ministry in relation to its own specific task should be responsible for that particular sector of unemployment. For example, the ministry of health should be responsible for the unemployment figures and they should be doing the mismatch or the match between the graduates of the sector and how could they actually fill into the jobs of the market. So, I think there is an overall comprehensive picture that should be looked into rather than just looking it from an aggregate point of view. JD: I'd like to talk to you on a personal level. You are a father of three, two of (your children) are training to be solicitors or attorneys in the UK. Would you welcome them back and say there is enough opportunity in your own market? NK: I would definitely like them to carry on working in Jordan. Wherever you go there is a challenge for every individual. Even if you want to go and find a job in the UK you still have to compete with a lot of challenges and compete with a lot of those who probably have better qualifications than yourself. Therefore, even in Jordan you still have to compete and I think it's only making Jordan stronger to try to present themselves to the labor market to represent themselves with more communication skills and more experiences. I don't think I should worry about them finding a job in Jordan if they are qualified.","Jordan has high rates of youth unemployment .

"Moscow, Russia (CNN) -- The mortality rate in Moscow, Russia, has ""doubled recently"" because of an extended streak of heat and smog, Andrei Seltsovsky, the head of the city health department, told Russian news agencies Monday. Seltsovsky said that the average daily mortality rate in Moscow is 360 to 380 cases, but ""today the rate is around 700."" Out of 1,500 slots in city morgues, 1,300 were occupied, he added. The death toll directly attributed to the country's recent spate of wildfires remained at 52, the Russian Health and Social Development Ministry said on its website Monday. Another 62 people across Russia were in hospitals with wildfire-related ailments, and in all, 741 people had sought wildfire-related medical assistance, it said. CNN iReport: See and share images of Russia wildfires . The ministry said 22 out of the country's 83 regions, mostly in central Russia, are affected by wildfires. And no relief is in sight, with temperatures forecast to remain high in central and northwestern Russia through August 20. The Russian meteorological service Roshydromet said on its website Monday that the level of air pollution will remain high in and around Moscow in the coming days. ""The air will remain filled with products burning in forest and peat fires, and with toxic emission coming from motor vehicles and industrial enterprises,"" Roshydromet said. It asked Moscow's industrial businesses to start cutting emissions by 20 to 40 percent from 3 p.m. Monday until 3 p.m. Wednesday to help reduce air pollution. Alexander Frolov, who heads Roshydromet, appeared live on Russian state TV on Monday. He said high levels of pollutants in the Moscow air pose a serious danger to Muscovites' health. ""The highest levels were registered on August 7 and 8, with the concentration of particulate dust exceeding the permitted level by 3.4 times. It is very harmful for the human body as it accumulates in it and is virtually not excreted,"" he said. Frolov said carbon monoxide and ozone levels were significantly higher than the permitted norm. ""It can be said that we lived through probably the worst time with very high levels of harmful substances caused, firstly, by exhaust from motor vehicles and industries and, secondly, by forest fires,"" he said. The Moscow region and the majority of the European part of Russia remain in a zone of high fire risk, Frolov said. According to the Russian index of fire risk meteorological indicators, developed by Roshydromet, most of the European part of Russia is in the fifth, or emergency, risk class for wildfire potential. Forests in the southwest, south and southeast of the Moscow region are particularly fire-prone, primarily because of peat bogs, he said. ""As many as 276 wildfires have been extinguished,"" Russia's emergency ministry told the state media RIA Novosti on Sunday. ""Currently, 554 wildfires are raging on an area of over 190,000 hectares,"" or more than 730 square miles. The dire conditions also are wreaking havoc on agriculture in Russia, Frolov said. ""Unfortunately, the forecast is for virtually no precipitation in August,"" he said. ""Precipitation is crucial as we now need to think when to plant winter crops. The situation in many regions is such that so far there is no reason to start planting winter crops, despite the optimal planting time beginning in some regions."" Roshydromet forecasts a 30 percent drop in Russia's harvests due to the drought, he said. Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin announced a ban on grain exports last week that will start on August 15 and could last until December 31. At Monday's government meeting broadcast on state TV, Putin said the order was prompted by uncertainty over this year's farm production. A decision on the timeframe for the grain export ban will happen only after the results of the harvest are known, Putin said. Some regions won't be sowing winter grain at all this year, so a swift end to the export ban shouldn't be expected, he said. ""Of course, this is a temporary measure, but we are in an extraordinary situation and we have to worry about our own citizens and our own farmers,"" Putin said. ""The question is what the country will be left with in 2011. We don't know what the harvest will be and how much carry-over grain there'll be in 2011."" The prime minister said Russia would need 78 million metric tons of grain to support its people this year, but because of the drought, the country might produce only 60 million to 65 million metric tons, forcing it to dip into its ""state intervention fund."" ""One can say that neither we nor our ancestors observed or registered anything like it, in terms of heat, within a 1,000-year period since the foundation of our country,"" Frolov said Monday. ""This phenomenon is absolutely unique. There is no record of such cases.""

"Namibia's Fish River Canyon looks petite to anyone who's ever visited Arizona's Grand Canyon. Still, the gorge runs an impressive 1,800-feet deep and 100 miles long. It is the second largest natural gorge in Africa, and one of the most picturesque scenes the continent has to offer. Here's why you should visit the Fish River Canyon right now. The Quiver Tree Forest . The striking quiver tree, or kokerboom, is unique to Namibia, and only found in the southern part of the country. A species of aloe, the quiver tree is renowned for its unique, sculptural beauty. The name comes from the fact that local bushman traditionally used the tree's quills to make their quivers. Nearly 300 trees congregate in the Quiver Tree Forest, 124 miles from the Fish River Canyon, and a handy stopping-off point for anyone making the long trek out to the remotely situated gorge. Giant's Playground . Nearby the Quiver Tree Forest is the area known as Giant's Playground, so called because of the stacked arrangements of massive, dolerite rocks that can't help but look placed by human (or giant) hands. As it happens, the maze-like formations are completely natural. ""This area is sub-volcanic. It was a shallow sea millions of years ago,"" explains Marian Hulme, the owner of the local rest camp and caretaker of the forest. ""Lava pushed up and cooled down underneath the water. After the water disappeared, it opened up with erosion and [formed] like this,"" she says. In addition to these natural sculptures, Hulme's father, who was a caretaker before her, created art from stones and recycled materials. Hulme keeps up the tradition. ""Everything here tells a story. That's the idea [behind the art],"" she says. You can mule trek . Many tour operators offer two-to-five day mule treks. Visitors can explore the area with a guide on foot, while mules carry the load of their baggage. Mannfred Goldbeck, a local historian and CEO of tourism venture The Gondwana Collection, launched the Canyon Mule Trail years ago. ""I looked at the Grand Canyon and saw how they do it there, and just adapted it,"" he explains. ""We are constantly looking for activities that are soft adventure, and have a minimum impact on the environment. We are giving this area back to nature. We have to be the custodians of this area for generations to come,"" he says. Eco-tourism . While the canyon -- parts of which are 500 million years old -- remained unchanged for millennia, Goldbeck explains the arrival of European settlers in the 18th century had an unsettling effect on the canyon's ecosystem. Years of over-hunting and over-grazing took their toll, and a lot of local flora and fauna started to disappear from the area. ""The first explorers came in and they disrupted the balance that existed here. This is a very dry area, and only gets some rain [two to four inches yearly],"" says Goldbeck. In addition to its tours, The Gondwana Collection has created a private nature reserve in the area, and built several eco-lodges around the canyon. Goldbeck says the operative's aim is threefold. ""Tourism was secondary,"" he explains. ""Our first idea was to protect this area. We also wanted to bring people back into the area that once lived here. We had three legs: environmental, financial and social. Without any one, the pot will not stand.""","Namibia's Fish River Canyon is 500 million years old .

"The arrest of a man who allegedly obtained an image of a senator's bedridden wife has shaken up an already intense Republican primary battle in Mississippi. Political blogger Clayton Kelly was arrested Thursday, accused of exploiting a vulnerable adult and illegally and improperly obtaining a photo of her without her consent for his own benefit, according to the Madison Police Department. Donald Clark, an attorney for Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Mississippi, and his wife, Rose, told The Clarion-Ledger newspaper that the woman in question is Rose, saying the Cochrans' ""privacy and dignity have been violated."" Rose Cochran suffers from dementia and has lived at St. Catherine's Village, the nursing home where Thursday's incident took place, for 14 years, according to the newspaper. ""I have been fortunate to have a wonderful family, and like so many families, we are deeply affected by my wife's serious, long-term illness, that we consider to be a very private family matter. We will continue doing everything we can to protect my wife's safety and security,"" said Cochran in a statement obtained by The Clarion-Ledger. Police say Kelly broke into the facility and took the picture by Rose Cochran's bedside. The photo surfaced in a political attack ad on YouTube that aimed to smear Cochran, according to The Clarion-Ledger. It is unclear how the photo was used because the ad was removed within hours of being posted, according to the newspaper. Kelly, a 28-year-old Madison, Mississippi, resident, has a host of social platforms that cover politics and often attacks the senior senator. The video, like the majority of Kelly's material, supported Cochran's opponent in the Republican primary -- and that's where things get politically complicated. Chris McDaniel is a lawyer, radio commentator and Mississippi state senator. With tea party support and endorsements from Club for Growth and Sarah Palin, he is challenging Cochran, and the race has been heated, with plenty of name-calling. When the incident first came to light, McDaniel's campaign distanced the candidate from Kelly, saying he was neither a volunteer nor a member of the campaign. ""I've reached out to Sen. Cochran directly to express my abhorrence for the reprehensible actions of this individual. This criminal act is deeply offensive, and my team and I categorically reject such appalling behavior. My thoughts and prayers are with Sen. Cochran and his family,"" McDaniel said in a statement. ""Politics is about the exchange of ideas and this type of action has no place in politics whatsoever and will not be tolerated."" Questions started to arise, however, when members of Cochran's staff suggested that a McDaniel staffer apologized to a Cochran staffer before the police report was even released, according to The Clarion-Ledger. The implication from Cochran's staff was clear: McDaniel's team must have some connection with Kelly if they knew about his arrest before the news broke. McDaniel's team was quick to fire back. ""The McDaniel campaign found out about the break-in when a local political blog posted about it at 11:40 p.m. last night. Sen. McDaniel has denounced the break-in and called Sen. Cochran to extend his condolences. It is unconscionable for the Cochran campaign and the liberal media to use the act of a sick individual to lob despicable accusations,"" said Noel Fritsch, a campaign spokesman. In a follow up email Sunday, Fritsch went further, pointing out that The Clarion-Ledger has updated its story multiple times and clarifying the time line of what the campaign knew when. McDaniel campaign manager and Mississippi state Sen. Melanie Sojourner saw the post at around 1 a.m. Saturday and ""was alarmed that it was likely Ms. Cochran who had been photographed based on the preponderance of evidence, including the name of the rest home and the comments on the blog,"" said Fritsch. She notified McDaniel briefly at around 7:30 a.m., reached out to Cochran's campaign manager to condemn the alleged crime shortly afterward and briefed the candidate in full at around 10:30 a.m., according to Fritsch. At 10:49 a.m., the campaign released its statement. So far, there has been no tangible evidence that links the campaign directly to Kelly. Kelly is being held at Madison County Detention Center, with bond set at $100,000.","Blogger who allegedly obtained an image of a senator's bedridden wife is arrested .

"A former aide and a former mistress of one-time presidential candidate John Edwards have settled a civil lawsuit between them that, among other measures, mandates the imminent destruction of sex tapes featuring Edwards and the woman. Orange County, North Carolina, Superior Court Judge Carl Fox on Thursday signed the settlement agreement between Andrew Young, his wife and Rielle Hunter, the woman who had sued the couple, according to court official Tammy Keshler. Hunter had sued Young and his wife, Cheri, for invasion of privacy seeking to reclaim materials that she said belong to her, including personal photographs and an alleged sex tape showing her with Edwards. While the settlement addresses the transfer and destruction of videos, photographs and other documents, no monetary damages were awarded and the Youngs admit no liability. The court clerk will destroy the sex tape, while the Youngs must make a good-faith effort to ensure that the copy of the video that they gave to the U.S. government is likewise destroyed, per the agreement. The former aide and his wife will get back family videos and photos, though they cannot use any that include Hunter or her daughter -- whom Edwards has admitted he fathered -- for anything besides family purposes. Edwards' fall: From golden boy to tabloid tale . Young wrote a book, ""The Politician: An Insider's Account of John Edwards's Pursuit of the Presidency and the Scandal That Brought Him Down,"" in which he describes an elaborate plan to use money from two wealthy benefactors to allow Edwards to maintain a relationship with Hunter. She worked as a videographer on the failed 2008 presidential campaign of the former North Carolina senator, who was also the Democrats' 2004 vice presidential nominee with running mate John Kerry. Plans are under way to make that book, ""The Politician,"" into a movie from Aaron Sorkin and Colvin Road Entertainment. The Youngs can use information already in the book, in court proceedings or otherwise in the public domain. But anything beyond that is prohibited by court order, and the couple cannot publicize the planned film. A gag order prohibits either of the parties from discussing the settlement. The agreement does not resolve the pending criminal contempt proceedings against Young and his wife. Young's former boss, Edwards, is scheduled to be on trial himself after being indicted last year on charges including conspiracy, issuing false statements and violating campaign contribution laws regarding donations to and payments from his presidential campaign. Edwards' pending criminal trial . Edwards denies any wrongdoing. Whether the money given to support Hunter by Edwards' benefactors -- as alleged by Young in his book -- should have been considered campaign donations is a key issue in Edwards' upcoming trial. The ex-senator's legal team has disputed that notion, maintaining the money was a gift to Hunter. If convicted on all counts, Edwards could face 30 years in prison and a fine of up to $1.5 million.","John Edwards' ex-mistress had sued his former aide for invasion of privacy .

"A tiny bird is frustrating game players in record numbers, again. This time it's ""Flappy Bird,"" a no-frills smartphone game that has become the most downloaded free iPhone and Android app in the past week. The game's fluttering rise to the top has been a viral mystery. Its addictiveness and absurd level of difficulty have driven many to the brink of madness and spawned a number of online rants and hysterical reviews. The game's concept is simple. You are steering a bird, a wide-eyed, 8-bit yellow bird with no tail and some serious navigational issues. There is only one goal. Tap the screen to make Flappy fly and navigate it safely through an obstacle course of metal pipes. Cruise through a narrow gap between pipes to get a single point. Touch a pipe, however, and the little bird dies with a loud smack, nose-diving from the pale blue sky to the ground. ""Flappy Bird"" seems so easy, so completely inane that you are instantly angered by how difficult it is to keep the creature alive. Obviously you must keep playing until you get at least one point. Then, intoxicated by your hard-earned victory, you continue playing. It's all tappity tap tap, death, anger and repeat until you notice an hour has passed, and you've only managed to get a high score of 3 points. You are a smart, successful human with a college degree and a job, and you can't stop steering a bird through a little virtual maze in the hopes of a double-digit score. Side effects of playing too much ""Flappy Bird"" include soreness of the tapping finger, anxiety, guilt, waves of anger and even existential crises. ""There is little else as substantive and convincing as 'Flappy Bird' that the smartphone era has driven us to the cliff of insanity when it comes to compulsive behavior, contracting attention spans, and a desire to succeed at something arbitrary and meaningless,"" says CNET's Nick Statt in an article titled ""Flappy Bird is the embodiment of our descent into madness."" Over at Forbes, Paul Tassi wonders, ""What does that say about society as a whole? Have we reached a level of boredom bordering on dangerous if we're spending our time en masse on something so pointless?"" ""Flappy Bird is a condition of the universe,"" says writer and game designer Ian Bogost in a 2,800-word article for The Atlantic. ""A condition in the sense of a circumstance, but also in the sense of a blight, a sickness, a stain we cannot scrub out but may in time be willing to accept. A stain like our own miserable, tiny existences as players, which we nevertheless believe are more fundamental than the existence of bird flapping games or machine screws or the cold fog rising against the melting snow in the morning,"" Wow. So much angst from one little app. ""Flappy Bird"" was created by Dong Nguyen, a Vietnamese developer with a studio called DotGears. He did not reply to a request for an interview and has stayed mostly quiet in the wake of the game's recent and sudden success. Nguyen did give an interview in January to Chocolate Lap Apps, saying that Western mobile games are unnecessarily complicated and that he wanted to make something simple. Even though smartphones have elevated mobile gaming with rich graphics and intricately designed apps, the platform has a history of simple, addictive games becoming incredibly popular. Witness ""Bejeweled,"" ""Candy Crush"" and even the early iPhone hit ""Paper Toss."" ""Flappy Bird"" is just the latest in a string of smartphone games starring avians, though it makes ""Angry Birds"" look like ""World of Warcraft."" One of the great mysteries of ""Flappy Bird"" is why it suddenly shot to the top of the most downloaded charts. It was originally released for the iPhone in May but didn't become the top free iPhone app until mid-January, following a surge in popularity that seems to have kicked off in early December. Nguyen told Chocolate Lab Apps he created the game in two to three days and says he did not promote the app in any way after its release. There are some unproven theories floating around about the game's sudden success, including the use of bots to get it on Top 10 lists artificially, organic enthusiasm on social media and a surge in amusing user reviews in the Apple App and Google Play stores. ""Flappy Bird"" currently has an average four-star rating from more than 543,000 reviews in the Apple App Store and 228,000 on Android. Many of the reviews are lengthy, tongue-in-cheek tales of time lost, marriages ended and lives ruined by playing the game. Android users report wanting to destroy their phones in frustration by throwing them off bridges, tossing them into the blades of a helicopter or running over them with 18-wheel Mack trucks. Reviewers curse the game and warn others not to follow them down the dark hole of ""Flappy Bird."" ""My family called an exorcist to try and remove this devil game but flappy bird had already firmly gripped my soul,"" said iOS user Ahhccwat. ""My boss fired me. My kids stopped talking to me.

"(CNN)  -- Chinese basketball star Yao Ming has suffered a fresh injury setback which could place his NBA career in jeopardy. The seven-time All-Star has a stress fracture in his left ankle, his Houston Rockets team announced on its website. Yao, 30, has been sidelined since November 10 after playing just five games in the current NBA campaign. The giant 7ft 6 (2.29 meters) center also sat out all of last season after fracturing a bone in his left foot and undergoing major surgery. The Rockets said his stress fracture is related to the previous injury and was discovered by an MRI scan after problems emerged during his rehabilitation program. ""There is no timetable for his return at this time,"" said the statement. Yao averaged 10.2 points and 5.4 rebounds a game in his five games this season for the Rockets, whose playoff hopes have been dented by his absence. Yao was the first pick in the 2002 NBA draft and has built up a reputation as one of its leading players during his career at Houston. A national hero in China, Yao has represented his country in the 2004 and 2008 Olympics, helping them to the quarterfinals on each occasion. He carried China's flag at the opening ceremony for the 2004 Games in Athens.","Chinese basketball star Yao Ming sidelined by stress fracture to left ankle .

"With 100% of precincts reporting results, CNN can report that the Mississippi Republican Senate primary is headed for a June 24 runoff. Sen. Thad Cochran and Chris McDaniel will battle again after both candidates fell short of the 50% threshold needed to avoid another contest. The race is a high-profile tea party vs. establishment showdown. For tea party supporters, it's perhaps their best chance to claim victory after facing a string of defeats this year. Tuesday marked the biggest single day of primary voting in 2014, with contests in eight states. In Iowa, the winner of that high-profile GOP Senate primary had rare support from both sides of the battle between conservatives and the establishment. If Republicans can flip the Hawkeye State and five other Democratic-held seats, they will regain control of the Senate. And California used its new ""jungle"" primary system for the first time in a gubernatorial race. That's where the top two finishers advance to the November election, regardless of party affiliation. With Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown the overwhelming favorite, the race was for second place, and a moderate Republican edged out a tea party-backed conservative state lawmaker. Top Takeaways from Tuesday's primaries . Mississippi . At 76, Cochran is the second-oldest Senate incumbent running for re-election. McDaniel, a state senator, ran on a platform of change, saying Cochran, who has served in Congress for four decades, has been in Washington long enough. ""We don't have six more years of the status quo,"" he recently told CNN. ""I am not going to Washington, D.C., to be a member of the cocktail circuit or to make backroom deals. I'm going up there to fight and defend the Constitution."" Cochran and McDaniel were separated by fewer than 1,400 votes with McDaniel slightly ahead, 49.5% to 49%, according to numbers compiled by The Associated Press. A third Republican candidate in the primary race, Thomas Carey, grabbed 1.5% of the vote. So what happens next? The two candidates have a little under three weeks before they go head to head again. Runoffs usually have lower turnout and tend to favor challengers. Money will be key as both dig deeper into their campaign war chests and rely on outside help from independent groups. McDaniel's campaign was already asking for more cash Wednesday. ""I'm going to be brutally honest with you: our campaign is pretty low on money and there's no way we can win if conservatives from around Mississippi and America don't stand up and make sure we have the resources we need to win,"" he said in an email blast. FreedomWorks, a national tea party group that backed McDaniel, pledged to ""double down"" on its efforts to make sure he wins. Another conservative group, Club for Growth, even called on Cochran to drop out, but vowed to ""vigorously pursue this race"" in support of McDaniel no matter what. Cochran supporters also say they're ready for another round. Henry Barbour, who runs the pro-Cochran PAC Mississippi Conservatives, told CNN's Dana Bash that they're ""going to get up and rethink"" their message. ""Really organize from the ground up,"" he added. Barbour said ""complacency"" among Cochran voters ""hurt us"" and he thinks ""they got outshouted."" His group dished out six figures to support Cochran, who was also backed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which represents the interests of business. The chamber put out a statement in support of Cochran on Wednesday, but declined to specify if it will go up with another ad buy. Another leading outside group that tends to support establishment candidates, American Crossroads, said it would stay out of any runoff. Stuart Stevens, a Cochran adviser and former adviser to Mitt Romney, told Bash that three weeks allows more time to scrutinize McDaniel's record and ask tough questions. The winner will face off against former Rep. Travis Childers, who CNN projects will be the Democratic nominee, in November. Nasty Senate race digs deeper in the mud . Iowa . State Sen. Joni Ernst didn't have to take sides in the battle between grass-roots conservatives and the Republican establishment: She had the backing of both, and she easily came out on top in a crowded primary race. Ernst, a lieutenant colonel in the Iowa National Guard who grabbed national attention by touting her hog castrating skills in a campaign commercial, had the support of some top names and groups among both the tea party movement and the mainstream GOP. At her victory party Tuesday night, Ernst acknowledged and thanked her GOP competitors. ""It is going to take all of us pulling together to unite this party and win in November,"" she said. The race was originally a free-for-all between four major GOP candidates, but in the closing weeks of the campaign, Ernst pulled ahead of her rivals. The big question going into primary day was whether she would top 35%. If no candidate passed that threshold, the nomination would have been decided a week later by delegates at the Iowa GOP convention. But in the end, Ernst won in a landslide. Ernst will face off against Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley, who had no opposition for his party's nomination. The winner of November's general election will succeed longtime Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin, who is retiring at the end of the year. Republicans believe they have a good shot at flipping Harkin's seat. Big-name Republicans from both the establishment and conservative wings of the party, like Mitt Romney, Marco Rubio and Sarah Palin, joined Ernst on the trail. She also grabbed support from the Chamber of Commerce and the National Rifle Association as well groups like the Senate Conservatives Fund, which often backs like-minded candidates who launch primary challenges against incumbent Republican senators. Midterms: What's at stake . California gubernatorial race . Brown and Republican Neel Kashkari finished in first and second place, respectively, and will advance to the general election. Brown's first-place finish was never in doubt. Kashkari and fellow Republican Tim Donnelly were vying for the second spot. Some GOP strategists said they were concerned that if Donnelly, a conservative with tea party backing, had won, it could  have hurt Republican candidates come November in down-ballot races in a state where the general election electorate is much more moderate. Kashkari, a moderate, was a Treasury Department official under President George W. Bush. One time anti-war protester Cindy Sheehan was also on the ballot, the nominee of the Peace and Freedom Party, a socialist party. She grabbed about 1% of the vote. Sheehan became the face of the anti-Iraq war movement in 2005 when she protested for weeks outside Bush's ranch in Crawford, Texas, after her son Casey was killed in combat. 2014 midterms: What's at stake .","Mississippi Senate primary runoff will be June 24 .

"They call it an airbridge, but it feels more like a flight to another planet. The ""easiest"" way to get to the Falklands is on a British Royal Air Force charter flight from RAF Brize Norton in central England. But it's not that easy. From the time I shut my front door in Britain to the time we touch down on these remote islands, 24 hours have elapsed. An eight-hour leg to the Ascension Islands -- a tiny speck of land in the Atlantic -- and then another eight hours down to RAF Mount Pleasant on the Falkland Islands -- a slightly bigger speck of land. But this speck is suddenly back in focus as Britain and Argentina spar again over its sovereignty. The two countries went to war over the issue in 1982, and tensions between the two countries are rising again over the islands which Argentina calls Las Malvinas. How royal visit fuels Falklands spat . My first impression on landing is how similar the base is to the one we'd left in Oxfordshire. Here though, posters on the walls advertize the penguin colonies. For nature enthusiasts this is a paradise with vast swathes of untouched wildness. See high-res images of life in the Falklands . Outside the wire, a rough gravel road and barren countryside give the impression of being in the Highlands of Scotland. No trees, lots of sheep and every other car is a Land Rover. And lots and lots of ... well, nothing. No houses, no people, no electricity pylons, nothing. Finally we approach the capital Port Stanley, or just plain Stanley as the locals call it. It's more like a village really -- a couple of food stores, a post office, some pubs and a gift shop. And everything is quintessentially British. Red telephone boxes, warm beer, fish and chips. It reminds me of Cornwall or Scotland: windy, isolated and bathed in a similar dazzling light. Our first stop is Gypsy Cove, where we see Magellanic Penguins waddling across powder white sand. Perfect, apart from the signs warning you to watch your step, because this used to be an Argentine minefield. The mines should have been cleared, but you never know, seems to be the message. It doesn't exactly encourage parents to take their kids down to the water to watch the wildlife. The islanders are proud, tanned, rugged and permanently wrapped up against the chill of the south Atlantic. They say they are Falkland Islanders first, British second, and most won't countenance the idea of becoming Argentine. They are no nonsense to the point of being, at times, slightly stubborn. But they are also immensely hospitable. Everyone seems to know everyone else -- many are related, distant cousins or connected by marriage. Hardly surprising in a community of just 3,000 people. They seem slightly amused and perplexed by some of the rhetoric coming out of Buenos Aires, but they are analyzing every word. It matters here. Many are withering about Cristina Kirchner, the outspoken Argentine President. They say their feelings have been utterly ignored in the war of words between Britain and Argentina. Most are fervently loyal to Britain but in fact these islands are not part of the United Kingdom. There are one of 14 British Overseas Territories like Gibraltar or Bermuda, a sort of halfway house between independence and colony. The Falkland Islands government can raise its own taxes and has its own bank notes, but it relies on the UK for defense and foreign policy -- and a supply of home comforts, like PG Tips Tea, Chocolate Digestives and Spitfire Ale. A couple of days into our trip, we get news of excitement at the only school on the island. An RAF search and rescue helicopter has landed on the football pitch. Everyone's taking pictures, hoping Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge is piloting the chopper. It's difficult to tell, but the town is abuzz afterwards. His presence here might be ""routine"" as the British Government says and ""provocative"" for the Argentines, but for the islanders it's special. He hasn't been spotted drinking in the local pubs yet, but on such a small island with so little to do, it's surely only a matter of time. We won't be here to share that first pint though -- the airbridge beckons for the long, long journey home.","The Falkland Islands, or Las Malvinas, are the source of a long-running dispute between the UK and Argentina .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on Monday challenged a university audience to look into ""who was truly involved"" in the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, defended his right to question established Holocaust history and denied there were gay Iranians. When pressed about the harsh treatment of women, homosexuals and academics who challenge Iran's government, Ahmadinejad painted a rosy picture, saying, ""Women in Iran enjoy the highest levels of freedom,"" he said. He elicited laughter and boos from the audience at Columbia University when he said, ""In Iran, we don't have homosexuals, like in your country."" His remarks, which lasted about an hour, made several general references to God, religion and science. He portrayed himself as an academic, misunderstood and unfairly criticized in the United States. Ahmadinejad is in New York to address the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday. He spoke at the invitation of Columbia's president, Lee Bollinger, who in his introduction excoriated the leader by saying he ""exhibit[s] all the signs of a petty and cruel dictator."" Blaming his schedule, Ahmadinejad left Columbia after his speech before answering many questions posed to him, Bollinger said. Hundreds gathered to protest Ahmadinejad's appearance, incensed that a leader who has publicly denied the Holocaust and called for the destruction of the state of Israel was given a prestigious forum to espouse his beliefs. Christine C. Quinn, speaker of the New York City Council, said Columbia should not be giving Ahmadinejad a platform. ""All he will do on that stage ... is spew more hatred and more venom out there to the world,"" she said. Hamid Dabashi, a professor of Iranian studies at Columbia, called the whole forum ""misguided."" Refusing to back off of his stance on Israel, Ahmadinejad again questioned whether the Holocaust happened. ""If the Holocaust is a reality of our time, a history that occurred, why is there not sufficient research that can approach the topic from different perspectives?"" he asked. The Iranian leader has made statements in the past suggesting Israel be politically ""wiped off the map,"" though he insists that can be accomplished without violence.  See some of Ahmadinejad's controversial remarks » . While he would not respond with a ""yes"" or ""no"" when asked Monday if he sought the destruction of Israel, he said the status of Israel should be determined by a free election. ""Let the people of Palestine freely choose what they want for their future,"" he said. Ahmadinejad has drawn fire for defying international demands that Iran halt production of enriched uranium. At Columbia, he said Iran is a member of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the world's central nuclear technology governing body, and has submitted many times to IAEA inspections. ""Over and over again the agency's reports indicate that Iran's activities are peaceful, that they have not detected a deviation,"" he said. Washington and other nations accuse Tehran of trying to create a nuclear weapons program.  Watch reaction to Ahmadinejad speaking at Columbia University » . Ahmadinejad said Iran questions ""the way the world is being run and managed today."" But he said Iran would hold talks with the U.S. government ""under fair and just circumstances."" U.S. officials have said Iranian explosives and weapons are making their way to Shiite Muslim militias in Iraq's sectarian conflict and have been used against U.S. troops in the four-year-old war. U.S. commanders have said they have captured Iranian agents involved in supplying those weapons to the militias, some of which have longstanding ties to Iran. On this point, Ahmadinejad employed a tactic he used often Monday -- answering questions with more questions. Bollinger asked, ""Why is your government providing aid to terrorists? Will you stop doing so and permit international monitoring to certify that you have stopped?"" Through a translator, Ahmadinejad replied, ""Well, I want to pose a question here to you. If someone comes and explodes bombs around you, threatens your president, members of the administration, kills the members of the Senate or Congress, how would you treat them? Would you reward them or would you name them a terrorist group? Well, it's clear. You would call them a terrorist."" Earlier Ahmadinejad had said he wanted to visit ground zero in New York to ""pay his respects"" to those who died in the attack on the twin towers at the World Trade Center. Several groups were outraged. Security became an issue and the visit was canceled. Asked what he hoped to accomplish there, the Iranian president said it was unfair he could not extend his sympathies to victims of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Addressing the press directly, he seemed to make a connection between the ""root causes"" of the September 11, 2001 attacks and a solution in Iraq and Afghanistan. ""If the root causes of 9/11 are examined properly -- why it happened, what caused it, what were the conditions that led to it, who truly was involved, who was really involved -- and put it all together to understand how to prevent the crisis in Iraq, fix the problem in Afghanistan and Iraq combined."" He stressed repeatedly that Iran wants to negotiate with the United States and other nations, several times describing Iran as a ""cultured"" and ""civilized"" nation. ""I think that if the U.S. administration, if the U.S. government puts aside some of its old behaviors, it can actually be a good friend for the Iranian people, for the Iranian nation,"" he said. ""For 28 years, they've consistently threatened us, insulted us, prevented our scientific development, every day, under one pretext or another."" As he ended his talk at Columbia, he invited faculty and students to visit any university in Iran they choose. ""We'll give you the platform. We'll respect you 100 percent. We will have our students sit there and listen to you, speak with you, hear what you have to say,"" he assured. Earlier Monday, in a question-and-answer videoconference with the National Press Club, Ahmadinejad said the Middle East can govern itself without interference from the United States and other Western nations. Speaking from New York to the luncheon in Washington, Ahmadinejad said Iran wanted to see ""an independent powerful Iraq ... which will benefit the entire region."" ""We are two nations interconnected,"" he said of Iran and Iraq. ""We are brothers and friends."" But he said the region didn't need U.S. help. ""We oppose the way the U.S. government tries to manage the world. ... We propose more humane methods of establishing peace,"" he said. E-mail to a friend . Copyright 2007 CNN.

"The FBI is scrambling to track a growing number of Americans who have left to join the fight in Syria, including investigating how the young men were recruited and the logistics of their travel, officials said Thursday. Dozens of Americans are among the thousands of foreigners who have flocked to Syria to take part in its bloody civil war. ""How are people being radicalized, what methods are being used, and what are the logistics behind the travel of some of these young men?"" said Kyle Loven, chief division counsel for FBI in Minneapolis, discussing how Syria has replaced Somalia as the go-to place for young jihadists in recent years. For three years, there was only one known American casualty in Syria. But, in recent days, the toll may have tripled. On Wednesday -- months after a Florida man killed himself in a northern Syria suicide bombing and a day after news broke that Douglas McAuthur McCain, a 33-year-old man reared in Minnesota, died fighting for ISIS -- a coalition of Syrian opposition groups announced that its forces had killed another American in battle. ""Although we have social media involved in radicalization efforts, we want to determine also if there is a ground game here with respect to radicalization our youth,"" Loven told CNN. Authorities are trying to determine whether the other American killed in Syria last weekend is Abdirahmaan Muhumed, a U.S. official told CNN. U.S. counterterrorism and intelligence officials were working to verify the name but have not confirmed it. The death of McCain was easier to verify because of photos of his neck tattoo, the official said. But Omar Jamal, a friend of Muhumed's family, told CNN from Minneapolis that Muhumed was the second American killed in fighting over the weekend. The Syrian coalition did not name the fallen American. But it did say he and McCain died as its forces battled Kharijites, a historical reference to fanatical Muslims who rejected moderate teachings and advocated killing those who violated ultraconservative values. The coalition noted that its fighters from groups with names such as Hazem Movement, the Islamic Front, Al-Mujahideen Army, Noureddine, al Zanki Battalion, Faylak Al Sham had joined those from the more moderate Free Syrian Army and more extremist al-Nusra Front. They took on ISIS forces last weekend in and around Aleppo -- which is where McCain was killed. Still, the idea of more Americans fighting for groups like ISIS, and more of them dying, wouldn't be surprising. Since about 2007, the FBI has been tracking members of Minnesota's large Somali community who were recruited to fight for the Al-Shabaab terror organization in Somalia. In recent years, some of those radicalized young men have been recruited to travel to Syria. The story of one of them, Troy Kastigar, who was a close friend of McCain's, predated McCain fighting -- and dying -- overseas. Kastigar converted to Islam and traveled to Somalia in 2009 to fight for Al-Shabaab militants. He was killed that same year after appearing in a YouTube video encouraging young Americans to join the struggle. Kastigar's mother, Julie Ann Boada, told CNN Thursday that the young man in the recruitment video for the hardline Islamic group is in fact her late son. Her son ""was wanting to have a purpose and wanting to be a valuable human being and not finding that,"" she said of the spiritual search of her son and his friends. ""And then I think some of the things they were told were lies and some things were truths... I think they felt that they could go help some people who needed help."" Kastigar attended the same Minnesota high school as McCain. Boada said her son was a bright, passionate and energetic young man who enjoyed karate, basketball and dancing. ""He really wanted to make a difference in the world,"" she said of her son. Boada said her son struggled in school, had some legal troubles and a hard time finding a job. He turned to religion and left for Kenya to study the Quran, she said. ""I think they were manipulated,"" she said. ""I don't think they knew fully what they were a part of."" She added, ""The thing to focus on is, to not make young men ...  feel powerless in our community."" Some young men were lured to Syria, which isn't exactly a stable place with stable borders. Nor is neighboring Iraq, where ISIS -- under the name it calls itself, the Islamic State -- has made major advances in recent weeks. ""The ability to travel into these countries demonstrates how porous the borders are,"" said U.S. Army Brig. Gen. Mark Kimmitt, who had top roles in the State and Defense Departments in President George W. Bush's administration. ""I think we need to understand that there's going to be more of this rather than less of this."" Sources: McCain radicalized gradually . The first American casualty was Moner Mohammad Abu-Salha, a 22-year-old from Florida who joined al-Nusra Front, an al Qaeda-linked organization that the U.S. government has blacklisted as a foreign terror organization. The group showed a video of him, and U.S. officials later confirmed, taking part in a suicide bombing earlier this year in northern Syria. U.S.: Jihadi in suicide bombing video grew up in Florida . On Tuesday, the world was introduced to Douglas McCain. Friends and relatives described him as a decent man who loved to play basketball and loved his family. His conversion to Islam didn't alarm his relatives, according to uncle Ken McCain, though Facebook posts in support of ISIS did. He'd been on U.S. authorities' radar for some time by then. They become aware of McCain in the early 2000s, due to his association with others -- including one person from Minnesota who died in Somalia, apparently while fighting as a jihadi -- a U.S. official said. Still, there was no indication then that McCain -- who at one point studied Arabic at San Diego City College -- was involved in anything nefarious. Law enforcement sources told CNN that he appears to have radicalized gradually in the years since his conversion. Authorities didn't know about McCain's travels to Turkey until he was already there, a U.S. official said. Turkey was also the last place where, several months ago, McCain was in contact with his relatives. At the time of his death, at least, McCain was on a list of Americans believed to have joined militant groups. Such people would be stopped and subjected to additional scrutiny if they traveled, according to the official. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki added that U.S. authorities knew about McCain's ties to ISIS. Psaki didn't say how they approached his case, specifically, though she did lay out the government's general strategy and concerns about cases like his. ""We use every tool we have to disrupt and dissuade individuals from traveling abroad for violent jihad and to track and engage those who return (to the United States),"" Psaki told reporters Wednesday. ""(McCain) is a reminder of the growing concern that the United States has, that many countries in the world have, about the thousands of foreign fighters from 50 nations who are engaged in Syria and who are affiliating themselves with ... extremist groups."" Opinion: ISIS: Is it really a threat to the U.S.? Official: Americans-turned-extremists 'willing ... to die' ISIS, especially, isn't just any extremist group. Its tactics are so brutal that even al Qaeda -- which was behind the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks -- disown them. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel last week called ISIS ""beyond just a terrorist group. They marry ideology, a sophistication of strategic and tactical military prowess. ""This is beyond anything we have seen, and we must prepare for everything."" Who is ISIS? That includes more Americans dying. Some might be like McCain, who went to the Middle East to join the jihad. Or there may be more like James Foley, the American journalist that ISIS beheaded -- a gruesome execution that it videotaped and broadcast, along with the promise of more such killings if the United States doesn't continue to strike ISIS in Iraq.

"""Mr. Gulden works in two great photographic traditions -- that of Edward Curtis, who devoted his life to documenting the passing of a way of life, and that of Ansel Adams, who wanted to make photos of nature that were indelible. To have combined them is another remarkable accomplishment."" So wrote the Wall Street Journal in a review of photographer David Gulden's most recent book ""The Centre Cannot Hold,"" (Glitterati), published last year. Known for his evocative black and white images of wildlife, the New York native has spent the past two decades photographing primarily in Kenya. Gulden's obsessive patience, his passion for these animals and his talent are evident in his work -- many of his photographs capture an animal in the most intimate of moments, blissfully unaware of being observed. In her foreword of his book,"" writer Susan Minot introduces him as ""someone who tears the doors off vehicles so he can set his camera down at a unique low angle."" We caught up with the adventurous photographer between shoots in Nairobi. CNN: Your photos are known for ""not glorifying"" the animals that you shoot. What does that mean to you? David Gulden: I try to make my photos a bit gritty, a bit raw. I don't wish to over dramatize my subjects and I wish to avoid sentimentality. There's beauty in east Africa's wildlife but it's a stark and often harsh beauty. There's no glory, only survival. CNN: Have you ever had any accidents while photographing on safari? David Gulden: An agitated female black rhino with a young calf charged my vehicle. She smashed into the driver's door with full force and then, like something out of ""The Flintstones"" -- she thrust her horn up through the ceiling and it popped out the top of the roof. No one got hurt including the two rhino. CNN: What are some tips for photographing on safari? David Gulden: Don't be afraid to get weird or try something unusual. Be wary of the safari guide who thinks he knows everything. CNN: What cameras do you use? I'd been using Nikon film cameras but my vehicle caught fire and burned to the ground with all my gear inside. Now I use Canon digital cameras. More: Amazing desert photographs taken by paragliding photographer . CNN: Why do you prefer using black and white in your photography? David Gulden: Black and white is more timeless than color -- it invites the viewer to look more closely. CNN: What is the longest you've ever waited for a shot? David Gulden: It took three years to photograph the mountain bongo. There are less than 100 of them in the wild and they live in rough, remote, densely vegetated mountain terrain and they are extremely shy. I have yet to see one -- I got the photo using a sophisticated camera trap. CNN: How did you first get into safari, and what made you keep going back? David Gulden: My father took me on safari when I was 15, and I fell hard for it. When I was 18, before I returned to take a semester course in Kenya with the National Outdoor Leadership School, my dad introduced me to the photographer Peter Beard -- the most interesting man imaginable -- and there was no turning back. CNN: How often do you travel? David Gulden: I live in the suburbs of Nairobi, so I have to travel to get to the wilderness. The good thing about my home is that I can go in any direction and in only a few hours' drive, I'll find the greatest wildlife on the planet.

Harold Diamond, a 39-year veteran of Monticello School District took the cash option on the $326 million jackpot, which will total $130,676,438 after taxes, according to the New York Lottery statement. Diamond purchased the life-changing ticket after voting on Election Day in November. As it became clear he and his wife, Carol, won't make it to dinner because of stormy weather, she insisted they stop and eat at the Valero and wait for the weather to clear.  ""I have to thank her with both barrels, because if it weren't for her insistence, we would not be here today,"" he said in the release. While eating at the Subway shop within the Valero, Diamond noticed the Mega Millions jackpot flashing on the Lottery terminal and decided to get ten $1 Quick Pick numbers for that evening's drawings. Diamond said he forgot about the ticket and remembered only when he heard people talk about it while playing golf, according to the New York Lottery news release. ""I put the ticket in my wallet and forgot about it,"" he said. ""I went to play golf the next day and the guys in the clubhouse were talking about the jackpot-winning ticket someone bought at a Valero on Route 302, and I thought, wait a minute -- I bought a ticket there last night! As soon as Diamond realized he was holding a lottery ticket from the shop, he rushed home to catch the evening news and saw that six numbers drawn matched the second set of Quick Pick numbers on his ticket, he said. ""When I saw the last number, I yelled up to my wife I think we won a few bucks,"" he laughed, at the check awarding ceremony. Diamond said they proceeded to read the numbers back and forth to each other. ""We were like in a daze, in a dither,"" he said. Diamond's win marks the 29th time a New Yorker has won the top prize on the multistate megajackpot game, which launched in 2002. ""We couldn't be more thrilled. They were just a gem of a couple,"" said Carolyn Hapeman, spokeswoman for the New York Gaming Commission.

"(CNN)It is not easy to capture a man's life in 152 minutes, let alone a life as illustrious and complex as Nelson Mandela's. For London-born actor Idris Elba, who played the South African leader in the 2013 biopic ""Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom,"" the task was sure to feel Herculean. ""I could never really articulate what it felt like to play Mandela properly in an interview,"" he admits in a phone conversation with CNN. Though the actor is British, and physically bears little resemblance to the late South African leader, Elba recalls the unexpectedly warm reception he received, particularly from extras on set -- many of whom were locals who lived through the apartheid era. ""South Africa is very embracing. Even though I'm not from South Africa and was about to play Mandela, they still gave me a lot of love,"" he says. By the end of filming, many were even calling him ""Madiba."" The experience, life-changing in many ways, was bound to feel odd. For Elba, the best way to capture not just the man but the feeling of playing him on film, was through music. Next week will see the release of ""Mi Mandela,"" a tribute to Mandela made up of songs written and produced by Elba himself, and performed by a mixture of South African and British talent, including Mumford & Sons, the Mahotella Queens and Maverick Sabre. ""There were various sensations I experienced (playing Mandela), and I could never give an answer I was satisfied with. I think this album represents that answer. It allows me to express the feelings of playing him,"" says Elba. The ""Luther"" actor describes the record as a ""character album,"" and hopes to produce similar projects for the many other roles he's taken on over the years. In this respect, ""Mi Mandela"" is as much about his own journey as it is about Mandela's. In the album's title song -- the only one that Elba performs on -- he has a tongue-in-cheek lyric about the casting choice. ""All the families showed me love, the people wished me well/The whole town wondering how Mandela could be played by Stringer Bell,"" he sings, referring to his breakout role in HBO's ""The Wire."" ""It's the thoughts I was thinking at the time of making that film. Music is a good way to get closer to a character, closer to an actor. It describes the whole journey of playing Mandela. It's better than any picture, any postcard, any script, any autograph from an actor,"" he says. ""I would love to hear a character album from Marlon Brando in 'The Godfather,'"" he admits. ""Just to understand what Marlon was going through at the time of making that film, how he was feeling playing that character. What kind of music would that be? What would it sound like? That would be fascinating for me."" A link to his father . For Elba, playing Mandela had personal resonance as well, as filming for the role coincided with the death of his father. ""I lost both men around the same time,"" Elba confides. ""Mandela reminded me of my dad, and my dad reminded me of him. They were both massive symbols in my life."" Elba describes how his father, a Sierra Leone-born shop steward working out of London's Hackney, fought for the rights of union workers at a time in English history when their plight was particularly arduous (it was Maggie Thatcher's time in power, after all). ""He was always equating himself with Mandela and people like Mandela who were standing up for what they believed in, and I would always succumb to 30-minute lectures about rights,"" he recalls. He co-wrote the song ""Tree,"" which features on the album and is performed by American artists Audra Mae and Cody Chesnutt, partially as a tribute to his father. ""Somebody tell my father, that we are standing by his tree/ And even though we miss him, we are glad that he's set free,"" the lyrics go. ""That song is particularly moving to me,"" says Elba. ""As much as I wrote it for my dad, it relates to Mandela too, even more so now."" Idris Elba's ""Mi Mandela"" is set for release on November 24 .","Actor Idris Elba releases his first album, ""Mi Mandela"" next week .

"(CNN) -- Selfies are everywhere. Even Indonesian macaques are getting into the game. In 2011, two of these Old World monkeys borrowed photographer David J. Slater's camera and reportedly snapped some pictures of themselves. One of the selfies by a female macaque has since gone viral, making its way to Wikipedia's free-to-use website. Slater asked the site to take down the photo, but Wikipedia asserts the photo is uncopyrightable because animals can't own copyrights. It raises two interesting questions: . First, can a monkey even acquire copyright in a selfie? Second, can a human acquire copyright in a monkey's selfie? It's a depressing idea, that the terabytes of gratuitous selfies snapped by vapid 20-somethings -- serving no other artistic purpose than showing off their outfit or their abs on Instagram -- would be entitled to copyright protection. Meanwhile, a one-of-a-kind ""selfie"" by a downright adorable monkey, might not be entitled to protection. But the law -- international and domestic -- is full of grim irony. In the United States, to qualify for copyright protection, a work (the photograph) must meet three criteria: . (1) It must be fixed in a tangible medium: No problem here. Photographs are a classic example of fixation in a tangible medium, just like paint on a canvas or doodles in a textbook. This is easily satisfied by our simian. (2) It must be ""original."" The Supreme Court has observed that this means possessing a shred of creative spark, no matter how crude, humble or obvious it might be. There's an important distinction to be made here, however: Animals might be capable of original works, but mere works of nature cannot qualify. A tortoiseshell or an ostrich egg is created by a living creature, and may be more symmetrical and aesthetically pleasing than many of the wacky sculptures gracing our federal buildings. But they are the result of survival or procreation, not a creative choice. Therefore, these animal creations are not original -- at least under copyright law. On the other hand, some animals do express themselves creatively, and with that minimal degree of creativity required by the law. It's just hard to say where we draw the line on the evolutionary scale. A finger-painting gorilla is likely expressing originality, but if you dip a beetle in ink and let him walk around on paper, is the beetle showing his creative spark? Or is he simply trying to flee? Overall, originality is a low threshold, and probably satisfied by the macaque's selfie. It's also a purely academic discussion, because while some animals' work may be original, unfortunately for aspiring macaques, no animal can ever be an ""author."" Which brings us to ... (3) The work must have an ""author.""  In the U.S., the term ""authorship"" implies that the work must owe its origin to a human being. Materials produced solely by nature, by plants, or by animals are not copyrightable. Similarly, in the UK, an author must be a ""person."" The bottom line is that monkeys may create works of art, but those works cannot qualify for copyright protection. So, can humans acquire rights in works created by animals? One view would be that (a) if animals are your property, and (b) they create property, then (c) the property of your property is also your property. A dairy farmer owns the egg laid by a chicken; kittens become the property of the owner of the cat that birthed them. Unfortunately for the photographer here, copyright ownership does not work the way ownership does on the farm. Because the monkey cannot create a copyrightable work, that work can never be copyrightable. On the other hand, if the photographer takes a work by an animal and turns it into an ink-blotted, Andy Warhol-inspired piece of pop art, then he acquires rights in the new creation. But in the case of a monkey's selfie by itself, that photograph immediately and forever falls into the public domain, and can be used by anyone, without permission. Society's view of animals has certainly evolved over the years. In fact, it has evolved so much that it creates public confusion. The concept of ""animal rights"" is a compassionate one, but it also runs counter to our current legal view of animals. Animal lovers routinely ascribe human qualities to their beloved pets, and animal rights activists will burn a columnist in effigy for daring to suggest that a dog shouldn't vote or drive a bus. For now, whether you consider monkeys to be property or peer, their pictures cannot qualify for protection in the Copyright Office. In the case of copyright, that which is created by Mother Nature, is owned by Mother Nature -- which is to say it is owned, not by one of us, but all of us.","Danny Cevallos: Photog whose camera used in viral monkey selfie wants it off Wikipedia .

"A jury will be allowed to consider a confession by a suspect with a low IQ who is accused of killing a 6-year-old boy more than three decades ago, a judge ruled Monday. In May 2012, Pedro Hernandez told police that he choked Etan Patz to death in New York City in 1979, police say. Hernandez's attorney, Harvey Fishbein, argued that his client falsely confessed and the statements were not reliable because Hernandez had been repeatedly diagnosed with schizophrenia and has an ""IQ in the borderline-to-mild mental retardation range."" The statements in question were made during three events across two days in May 2012: a 7½-hour interrogation, a 20-minute videotape of the statement following the interrogation, and a statement made at the district attorney's office the next morning, Fishbein said. ""I think anyone who sees these confessions will understand that when the police were finished, Mr. Hernandez believed he had killed Etan Patz. But that doesn't mean he actually did and that's the whole point of this case,"" Fishbein told CNN affiliate NY1. But Judge Maxwell Wiley ruled Monday that the confession was admissible, writing that Hernandez's waiver of Miranda rights was ""knowing and intelligent,"" according to court documents. Wiley cited reports of two forensic psychology experts who met with Hernandez and determined he was ""in fact capable of knowingly waiving his rights,"" the decision said. The two experts agreed that ""although the defendant has a very low IQ, that alone does not necessarily prevent a person from understanding Miranda warnings and making a knowing and intelligent waiver of his rights,"" court documents said. Fast Facts: Missing children in the U.S. Hernandez admitted to luring Etan, who was en route to a school bus stop, into the basement of a bodega where he worked as a stock clerk and killing him, according to police. The boy's body was put in a garbage bag and thrown away, Hernandez allegedly told authorities. The remains were never found. The Patz case garnered national attention after the boy went missing, and his picture was plastered on thousands of milk cartons around the country. Fishbein told CNN that although the jury will be able to consider the confession, it is now up to them to decide if it is truly reliable or not. In November 2012, a grand jury indicted Hernandez on second-degree murder and kidnapping charges. He pleaded not guilty in court the following month. The trial is set to begin January 5, Fishbein said. Who is Pedro Hernandez?","Jury will be allowed to hear Pedro Hernandez's confession to killing Etan Patz in 1979 .

"(CNN)In December 2013, photojournalist Levison Wood set out to become the first person to walk the length of the Nile River. During his travels, he was robbed at gunpoint, evacuated out of a war zone and almost eaten by crocodiles. He crossed swamps, climbed mountains, cozied up to scorpions in the Sahara desert, and dined on rat stew and grasshoppers. Those months, he says, were the best of his life. ""I've always been interested in the stories of the great Victorian explorers, like Livingstone and those guys,"" admits Wood. ""This was an opportunity to try and do something that nobody's ever done before, but really, it was an opportunity to explore Africa in the 21st century and see how things have changed and how they've stayed the same."" Wood's journey began in Rwanda, took nine months and spanned 3,750 miles. It was necessary to make the trip on foot, he says, because ""walking is the only way you can really get under the skin of a country."" Occasionally, he was joined by a film crew from the UK's Channel 4 (the network is planning to air a four-part documentary on his travels). Sometimes he traveled with a local guide. Mainly, though, he walked it alone. ""The biggest difficult was keeping up the motivation and momentum to wake up every morning, walk 20 miles, and do it over and over again,"" he says. ""At times, the monotony was crushing. Khartoum (in Sudan) marked the halfway point, and the most difficult time was probably just before I reached it. I wasn't halfway there and I still had 2,000 miles left to walk. That was pretty demoralizing,"" he admits. The kindness of strangers . Wood acknowledges that his survival was often dependent on the hospitality of local villagers, of which there was an abundance. The people of the Sudan, he says, were probably the most giving of all. ""It's portrayed in the Western media as this pariah state, and the government does leave a lot to be desired, but it had by far and away the most incredible hosts I've ever encountered across the world,"" he says. Even sharing water, he says, demonstrated an incredible act of kindness -- given it's a 20-mile walk to the nearest source for many villagers. Half the time he slept outdoors, while the other half he would lodge with a local. Food wasn't always a given. In Uganda, he recalled a two-day period when he went without food completely. ""My guide had a catapult,"" he recalls. ""He would shoot pigeons. We ate what we could catch. Other times we'd eat with villagers. The local delicacies could vary, from grasshoppers to rats."" Out of harm's way (almost) The journey wasn't without danger. Civil War in South Sudan broke out shortly after his arrival. As he ventured closer to the country, he started hearing tales of death, destruction, and a steady trail of fleeing refugees. He made it halfway through the country, to Bor -- the front line of the war. It was there that he was arrested and brought before an army commander, who told him he was not welcome, and threatened to kill him if he crossed into the rebel side. He was evacuated to the capital, and flew to North Sudan. ""I missed out 400 miles of the journey, but it was a sensible thing to do; carrying on through would have been tantamount to suicide."" Had he made the trip uninterrupted, he would likely have achieved a Guinness World Record. Now, he's not so sure, though he says it doesn't matter. ""It was never about breaking records, it was about taking the biggest adventure in my life, and it was certainly that."" The finish line . Wood's journey ended in Egypt, where the Nile meets the Mediterranean Sea. It was a cathartic moment, he says, and one that was bittersweet. ""When you're doing something every day for months and months, to see it end, there will be some sadness,"" he admits. Mainly, though, he remembers it as ""one of the happiest days of my life."" ""The first thing I did was run into the sea, and just enjoy the moment,"" he says.","Levison Wood spent nine months walking the length of the Nile River .

"(CNN) -- For many years, I had a pretty good working definition of cool: It was the thing that I was not. I was a chubby, bespectacled kid with a bowl haircut and my nose buried in the nearest book. When it came time to choose up sides for sports, they assigned me to the team with the best players — as a handicap. The cool kids came to school in Jordans and Polo. I rocked Keds and fake Sanrio T-shirts my aunts sent to us from Taiwan. And that, of course, pointed to the biggest and most insurmountable obstacle standing in the way of my joining the ranks of the cool — the fact that I was one of just four Asian kids in my entire school, a tally that included my younger sister. The cool kids were all white, except for a handful of black and Latino athletes. My fellow Asian students, meanwhile, were to varying degrees just like me: We were seen as permanently different, always out of sync with the shifting tides of style and status. Not quite outcast, but never part of the in crowd either. So when the phenomenon of Asian cool first arrived, I was caught off guard, and frankly, more than a little suspicious. When I was in college, Japanese and Hong Kong pop culture were first catching fire at the fringes; they'd attracted plenty of enthusiasts, but those fans were no cooler than I was. (Possibly less cool.) By the time I was working as a young journalist, I found myself on a beat covering anime and action cinema, J-rock and Cantopop, gadgets and gaming — all things I was personally fascinated by, but couldn't quite believe had attracted the attention of the so-called mainstream. And I secretly thought that it couldn't last. The popularity of Asian pop culture was a fad, and like all fads would eventually fade. I wasn't entirely wrong. After 1997 and reunification with mainland China, Hong Kong's star ebbed. Anime and manga remain hugely popular, but have lost the dominant position they once held among youth. Japan's once unassailable titans of technology — Sony, Panasonic, Toshiba — have seen their products fall out of place as the must-haves among mobile millennials. And yet, even as Hong Kong and Japan have moved out of the centerpoint of cultural cool, another Asian nation has stepped into the spotlight: South Korea — the origin point of Samsung, ""Snowpiercer,"" Girls Generation and ""Gangnam Style."" The surging popularity of Korean pop culture can be seen in the booming attendance at KCON, the annual California-based gathering for fans of Korean music, TV and cinema, which opens its doors this weekend at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena. ""Our numbers have doubled each year,"" says Angela Killoren, chief marketing officer of the event's organizer, the North American subsidiary of Korean entertainment giant CJ E&M. ""We had 10,000 fans at the first KCON 2012, 20,000 in 2013, and expect 30, around 40,000 to 50,000 persons overall enjoying the KCON experience this year"" — which includes the appearance of major TV drama stars, a head-to-head pro gaming throwdown, a talent contest called SuperstarKCON and a concert featuring chart-busting idols Girls Generation and G-Dragon as headliners. But even if Korea is the king of pop-culture cool now, can Korea hold onto the crown better than its Asian predecessors? That's a question Euny Hong addresses in her new book, ""The Birth of Korean Cool: How One Nation Is Conquering the World Through Pop Culture."" ""I think it can,"" she says. ""The difference between cool Korea and earlier Asian pop culture waves is that Korea has been working to make this happen for almost two decades. Korea is cool because it decided to be cool — it's the first country in history that has made being cool a massive policy priority, backed by the Korean government to the tune of billions of dollars."" The fact is, the machine of Korean pop culture is as sleekly designed, systematically engineered and massively marketed as any Samsung gadget. It's not just a gigantic money-making industry, it's also the primary source of ""soft power"" by which the nation seeks to shorten its path from war-torn, third-world country to the top ranks of world influencers. ""Koreans have a deep-seated desire to see the nation recognized and validated,"" Hong says. ""We study harder than anyone in the world, we work more hours, and it's all because of this need to see us finally come on top."" Japanese cool is quirky, the sum of the nation's eccentricities. Hong Kong cool is frenetic, representative of the society's freewheeling striving spirit. American cool is casual: It's cool that's anchored in doing without trying, it's about being quintessentially effortless. By contrast, Korean cool could not be more effort-ful. The hypnotic appeal of K-pop videos are not just their candy-colored, otherworldly aesthetic, it's also because their performers — sometimes numbering in the dozens — are invariably dancing in perfect sync, with a level of precision possible only because candidates for K-pop glory are recruited as adolescents and trained for years in groups that are required to live, take classes, eat, sleep and rehearse together until they've achieved a transcendent level of harmony. It all underscores the fact that the rise of Korean cool was hardly an accident — and that it could well have staying power. American pop is often seen by nations around the world as an invading force, crushing native alternatives with the unfair-to-the-point-of-being-weaponized scale of its marketing budgets. Korean cool, by contrast, is recognized as the product of hard work and ingenuity, developed by a nation that just a few generations ago was newly bisected by war and mired in desperate poverty. In the fastest-growing markets in the world — Southeast Asia, Latin America, Africa, the Middle East — K-pop is aspirational in part because it holds out hope that they, too, will someday be able to join the ranks of the global economy's cool kids. Which means that lifelong nerds like myself might not be a completely lost cause, either. Back to practicing my precision dance routines.","Jeff Yang: For many years, I was never one of the cool kids, part of the in crowd .

"If it ain't broke, don't fix it, the old adage goes. Yet that's exactly what Airbus is doing to its successful A330 model in order to up its stakes in the skies. Airbus will launch the A330neo range, a revamped version of A330 airliner, the company announced Monday at the 2014 Farnborough International Airshow held in England. The new wide-body planes will compete with Boeing's Dreamliner 787. ""The A330 has been one of our most successful aircraft in the Airbus wide-body family,"" said Kiran Rao, Airbus' executive vice president of strategy and marketing. Airbus has sold more than 1,300 A330 airplanes to nearly 100 customers worldwide, making it one of the most successful aircraft in the wide-body category, Rao said. ""What we are doing is making this aircraft, which is already great, better,"" he said. The newly launched A330-800neo and the A330-900neo (enhanced versions of the A330-200 and  A330--300 models, respectively) will feature several new features, according to Airbus, not the least of which is a vast improvement in fuel efficiency. With the help of new Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines, an 800 kilograms reduction in weight of the aircraft, and a new aerodynamic design featuring a 64 meters wingspan and curved wingtips, the new airliner will see a 14% reduction in fuel consumption per seat. ""We enjoy very good sales of the A330, but we were listening to our customers. People were telling us, your aircraft is fantastic, but would be even more fantastic if you could achieve a better level of fuel burn,"" Fabrice Brégier, president and CEO of Airbus, told CNN. But not everyone is convinced by Airbus' claims of better fuel efficiency. Boeing's marketing head, Randy Tinseth, said he found Airbus' estimate ""extraordinarily optimistic,"" according to the Wall Street Journal. Brégier also admitted that since the investment was not planned, the new model will increase Airbus' development costs through 2017. He also said he anticipated the A330neo family would ultimately improve profits, and that he expects to sell at least 1,000 of the aircraft, which will be available for delivery by the end of 2017, during the week-long airshow. Previous experience suggests that Brégier has a point. Sales for Airbus' A320neo, a similarly updated version of their older, single-aisle A320 model, has been off the charts, with over 2,800 orders since it was launched in 2010, the company said. The new models are appealing to airlines as they tend to be cheaper than completely new designs. Still, the reduced cost, though attractive, is not the only feature likely to bring in new customers. The new aircraft also come outfitted with updated controls in the cockpit, and a larger rest area for cabin crew. Rao says that customers will be please with wider seats (18 inches in economy) and an updated in-flight entertainment system that will allow passengers to watch movies in 3D.","Airbus is launching the A330neo range, a revamped version of its successful A330 models .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- National Football League owners approved a 10-year labor and revenue-sharing agreement with players, who late Thursday discussed key elements but did not vote on it. Owners, meeting in Atlanta, agreed by a 31-0 vote to end the current lockout. Team facilities could be open by Saturday, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said, if players approve the deal. ""It is time to get back to football,"" Goodell said. ""That's what everybody here wants to do."" Player representatives conducted a conference call Thursday night in which they discussed the proposal and the recertification of the NFL Players Association, which dissolved after the lockout began in March. There was no vote, the association told CNN. New Orleans Saints player Heath Evans, referring to the collective-bargaining agreement, tweeted: ""The owners tried 2 slip many things n2 the CBA 'they' voted on that were NEVER agreed 2!"" NFLPA executive director DeMaurice Smith said after the owners' vote that there was no joint agreement. SI.com said it obtained an e-mail Smith wrote to player representatives, indicating workers' compensation and other issues remain unresolved. The proposed collective-bargaining agreement with 1,900 players would last through the 2020 season. ""I do feel good"" about the prospects of resolving the situation, Falcons player representative Coy Wire told CNN before Goodell announced the terms. Carolina Panthers majority owner Jerry Richardson called the compromise ""fair and balanced."" The proposed agreement includes a new rookie compensation system, a salary cap of $142.4 million per club in 2011 and additional retirement benefits, according to the NFL. In a bid to reduce injuries, the pact limits practice times and full-contact practices. Clubs receive credit for actual stadium investment and up to 1.5% of revenue each year. Current players can remain in the player medical plan for life, under the owners' plan. They also will have enhanced injury protection benefit of up to $1 million of a player's salary for the year after his injury and up to $500,000 in the second year after his injury. The first preseason game -- the annual Pro Football Hall of Fame Game, between the Chicago Bears and St. Louis Rams -- has been canceled because of the delay in opening camps, Goodell said. It had been scheduled for August 7. The regular season is set to open on September 8. The owners call for the free-agent signing period to begin Wednesday. The league's owners imposed the lockout on March 11, suspending the labor deal in place at the time in hopes of creating a new financial structure. Players Tom Brady, Drew Brees, Peyton Manning and seven others subsequently filed an antitrust lawsuit against the league on behalf of other current and eligible NFL athletes. A judge in early April joined that action with another filed by retired players. Since the lockout, the two sides have faced off in courts and around conference tables. The major issues have revolved around how to divide the billions of dollars of revenue reaped via the league each year, rules of free agency, a possible rookie wage scale, retirement benefits and a host of other matters. The heart of the issue between the players and the owners was how to divide the league's $9 billion in revenue. Under the old agreement, NFL owners took $1 billion off the top of that revenue stream. After that, the players got about 60%. The owners said the old labor deal didn't take into account the rising costs related to building stadiums and promoting the game. The players argued that the league has not sufficiently opened up its books to prove this. CNN's Lateef Mungin, Kevin Conlon, Phil Gast and David Mattingly contributed to this report.","SI.com: In e-mail, NFLPA head e-mail says workers comp, other issues remain .

Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the decision would be implemented ""over time and with careful analysis."" But he said the service chiefs were unanimous in their support for the move. Officials told CNN on Wednesday that not every position will open all at once. Once the policy is changed, the Department of Defense will enter what is being called an ""assessment phase,"" in which each branch of service will examine all its jobs and units not currently integrated and then produce a timetable for integrating them. The Army and Marine Corps, especially, will be examining physical standards and gender-neutral accommodations within combat units. Every 90 days, the service chiefs will have to report on their progress. The move is one of the last significant policy decisions made by Panetta, who is expected to leave in mid-February. It is not clear where former Sen. Chuck Hagel, the nominated replacement, stands, but officials say he has been apprised of Panetta's coming announcement. ""It will take a while to work out the mechanics in some cases. We expect some jobs to open quickly, by the end of this year. Others, like special operations forces and infantry, may take longer,"" a senior defense official explained. Panetta is setting the goal of January 2016 for all assessments to be complete and women to be integrated as much as possible. And the Pentagon has left itself some wiggle room that may ultimately lead to some jobs being designated as closed to women. A senior defense official said if, after the assessment, a branch finds that ""a specific job or unit should not be open, they can go back to the secretary and ask for an exemption to the policy, to designate the job or unit as closed."" The official said the goal remains to open as many jobs as possible. ""We should open all specialties to the maximum extent possible to women. We know they can do it."" Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican who spent six years as a prisoner of war during the Vietnam War, said he supports lifting the ban on women serving in combat, pointing out women are already serving in harm's way. But he said the move should not fundamentally change the military. ""As this new rule is implemented, it is critical that we maintain the same high standards that have made the American military the most feared and admired fighting force in the world -- particularly the rigorous physical standards for our elite special forces units,"" McCain said in a statement. But Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington called Panetta's decision a ""historic step for equality"" that recognizes the role women play in the military. Murray leads the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee and is a member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. The Pentagon must notify Congress of each job or unit as it is sent up to the secretary to be opened to women. Then the Defense Department must wait 30 days while Congress is in session before implementing the change. It is a marked difference from the way the military ended the exclusion of gays serving openly, or the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy. In that case, there were no stipulations attached to openly gay service members. There was no staggered approach that integrated openly gay troops into units. It was instead done all at once, across the board. A senior defense official explained the Pentagon's reasoning behind the different approach: ""You're talking about personal choice of behavior versus physical capability. And they were already in the units. If you take a unit that's never had women before, that's quite a culture change."" Another senior defense official said the goal is ""to provide a level, gender-neutral playing field."" The American Civil Liberties Union recently filed a federal lawsuit against the Department of Defense, charging that combat exclusion is unfair and outdated, harms America's safety and prevents women from receiving training and recognition for their work. The plaintiffs, who include women awarded Purple Hearts, say the exclusion places them at a disadvantage for promotion. The ACLU said was thrilled about Panetta's announcement. ""But we welcome this statement with cautious optimism, as we hope that it will be implemented fairly and quickly so that servicewomen can receive the same recognition for their service as their male counterparts,"" Ariela Migdal, senior staff attorney with the ACLU Women's Rights Project, said in the statement. Earlier this month, the Army opened the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment to women, and it has begun recruiting female pilots and crew chiefs. The Navy has put its first female officers on submarines in the past year, and certain female ground troops have been attached to combat units in Iraq and Afghanistan. More than 800 women were wounded in those wars, and at least 130 have died.","Sen. McCain supports the move and says the military must keep its high standards .

"Two men in Thailand are in trouble with the law thanks to an Instagram photo posted by pop star Rihanna during her recent visit to the holiday island of Phuket. The singer was visiting Phuket for a few days between stops on her Diamonds World Tour, departing on Sunday for Singapore. Opinion: Rihanna is spot on about Phuket problems . During Rihanna's visit she shared many of her experiences on Twitter and Instagram, including a photo of her holding a loris -- an endangered primate native to Southeast Asia. The Instagram picture, believed to have been taken at Phuket nightlife hotspot Bangla Road, was captioned ""Look who was talkin dirty to me!"" and ""liked"" by more than 230,000 viewers. The problem is, it's illegal for anyone to charge tourists money to take photos with the endangered primates -- an issue wildlife groups have long been trying to stamp out on the island. More: 12 international laws you may not realize you're breaking . Thai authorities react swiftly . Officials in Thailand quickly went on the defensive when outrage over Rihanna's loris image spread. The government ordered the Ministry of Natural Resources and local Phuket officials to urgently investigate the matter, reported local website Phuketnews.com. Sunday night, a raid on suspected touts led to the arrest of two men, aged 16 and 20, who were taken to a local police station and presented to the media. ""It is very difficult to do the raids because the touts have spies,""  Awat Nithikul, leader of the patrol officers, told The Phuket News. ""If someone hears that the police are coming their way, there will be a person who calls the touts and tells them to move. But this is a big deal because it might affect Thailand's reputation."" The newspaper says the two arrested touts are waiting to be bailed, and the two lorises in their possession will be returned to a national park in the nearby province of Phang Nga.

Rihanna's tweets about her X-rated experiences relating to some of the country's more infamous tourist attractions also led to red-faced explanations by embarrassed officials. According to the Bangkok Post, an English-language daily newspaper, Rihanna's tweets led to one official saying, ""Sex shows were completely against the law."" ""The authorities and law officials have surveyed the area to arrest and fine those involved [in staging sex shows],"" he said. ""But the shows still happen."" On the flip side, some of the photos posted during Rihanna's holiday will likely be appreciated by the local tourism industry -- including multiple shots of her in bathing suits that show off the area's gorgeous scenery -- given she does have more than 9.7 million Instagram followers.

"(CNN) -- A soccer whistle-blower has criticized FIFA's ""culture of self-protection"" after the world governing body rejected her claim over a breach of confidentiality as the World Cup bidding saga rumbled on. ""Woe be to any other person who cares enough to risk personal safety to report FIFA corruption,"" said Phaedra Al-Majid, who was in charge of international media relations for the Qatar 2022 bid until 2010, in a public statement. Al-Majid along with another whistle-blower -- Australian Bonita Mersiades -- gave evidence to American lawyer Michael Garcia, who has investigated the bidding process surrounding the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. The women claim Garcia ensured they would have anonymity in his investigative report -- and that he broke his promise. It's a report that has become mired in controversy after German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert -- FIFA's independent ethics adjudicator -- published a summary of the evidence the American had collated. The two women insist that assurances were given to them both in private and public that they would not be compromised after agreeing to give evidence ""through a sense of natural justice and a desire to bring closure to a long running chapter in our lives."" The women were not identified by name, but they contend they were ""clearly identifiable"" in the summary of Garcia's report. However, FIFA's disciplinary committee said Tuesday there ""were no grounds to justify the opening of disciplinary proceedings"" given ""the breach of confidentiality claim had no substance."" Referring to Eckert's summary, FIFA said; ""No names were mentioned in the statement and any information provided was of a general nature. Thus, there was no divulgence of any information of a confidential nature."" FIFA added that Garcia ""in his letter to Disciplinary Committee chairman Claudio Sulser, concluded that the complaints by the participants in the investigation were without merit and that, as far as he was concerned, there had been no infringements by Eckert."" FIFA's ruling drew an incredulous response from Al-Majid. ""The conclusion of the FIFA Disciplinary Committee dismissing my complaint against Herr Eckert for breaching my confidentiality is a transparent avoidance of a clear violation of its own rules,"" she said. ""I cooperated with Mr. Garcia's investigation for over two-and-a-half years under a clear, unqualified promise of confidentiality. He asked me for my confidentiality and repeatedly promised me mine. ""I kept my promise. Herr Eckert breached that confidentiality. I did not. The Disciplinary Committee's avoidance of this undisputable violation is emblematic of its culture of self-protection."" While admitting she had made public statements in the past, Al-Majid insisted they were made ""long before I entered into a confidentiality agreement with Mr. Garcia. ""I made no public statements during the entire period of Mr. Garcia's investigation. ""I relied on FIFA's promise of confidentiality and continued to honor my promise until Herr Eckert published his 'Summary.' ""My recent public statements have only been made AFTER Herr Eckert's identification of me in blatant violation of FIFA confidentiality rules."" On Twitter, Al-Majid posted an explanation FIFA had sent her, which seemed at odds with the organization's media release explaining why it had dismissed her complaint, given the letter suggested she was not entitled to complain as she was no longer working in football. Former head of corporate affairs in the Australia 2022 bid Mersiades was equally critical of FIFA. ""FIFA is nothing if not predictable, and has today surpassed itself in obfuscation and deflection,"" Mersiades said in a public statement. ""These issues are no longer just about winning bids from Russia and Qatar and losing bids, including Australia. It is about FIFA and the bid process that lent itself to abuse. ""In FIFA's world, there is no room for ordinary fans. FIFA's world is littered with corruption, mismanagement and self-interest. ""The real football world -- the many millions of players and billions of fans -- deserve a better FIFA, one that is governed by people who make decisions and take action in a transparent manner and who are held accountable in the best interests of the sport and civil society. ""Will a new, independent candidate stand-up to depose the President and build a new FIFA?"" Eckert's report cleared Russia and Qatar, who will stage the 2018 and 2022 events respectively, of wrongdoing and instead was critical of rival bidders England and Australia. Soon after its publication, Garcia said the 42-page summary contained ""numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations,"" as he too lodged an appeal with FIFA's appeals committee. However, on Tuesday FIFA declared Garcia's appeal ""not admissible."" ""The said statement about the report on the inquiry into the 2018-2022 Fifa World Cup bidding process does not constitute a decision and as such is neither legally binding nor appealable,"" said FIFA. ""Mr. Garcia has just received the decision and is reviewing it,"" said a spokesman for the American lawyer. ""We have no further comment at this time.""","Soccer whistle-blower hits out at FIFA's ""culture of self-protection""

"A random act of violence has left a promising 23-year-old college baseball player dead, a family devastated and two countries half a world apart rattled. Christopher Lane, who was from Australia, was gunned down in Duncan, Oklahoma, while he was out jogging last week. The motive? Three teens who had nothing better to do, according to police. ""They witnessed a young man run by on the street. Chose him as the target,"" Police Chief Danny Ford told CNN affiliate KSWO. Charges were filed Tuesday against the three teens. James Edwards Jr., 15, and Chancey Luna, 16, were charged as adults with felony murder in the first degree, according to Kaylee Chandler, Stephens County Court Clerk. Michael Jones, 17, faces two charges -- use of a vehicle in the discharge of a weapon and accessory after the fact to murder in the first degree, she said. A judge set bond at $1 million for Jones, while no bond was set for Edwards and Luna, Chandler said. When police arrested the teens, one of them offered up a motive that made clear that Lane, who attended East Central University on a baseball scholarship, was chosen at random. ""He said the motive was, 'We were going to kill somebody,'"" Ford told Australian radio station 3AW. ""They decided all three of them were going to kill somebody."" A brutal crime . Police say the teens shot Lane in the back in the town of about 24,000 and sped away in their car. ""There were some people that saw him stagger across the road, go to a kneeling position and collapse on the side of the road,"" Ford told KSWO. Attempts to revive Lane failed. Police caught the teens a few hours after the shooting.  Thanks to security cameras from local businesses, police saw their car speeding down the street. Lane was remembered as magnetic -- the sort of person who could always lighten the mood. ""Chris was a charming guy, genuinely good person, with great character and had a love for life. As cliché as it sounds Chris was the kind of guy you want your sons to grow up to be and that you want your daughters to marry.  It just breaks my heart knowing how much more he could have brought to this world as a husband, father, son, brother and friend,"" said Sam Malchar, a former ECU teammate and classmate. Half a world away . Nearly 10,000 miles away in Australia, Lane's family struggled to cope with the news. ""He's left his mark as we know, and you know there's not going to be any good come out of this, because it was just so senseless,"" Christopher's father, Peter Lane, said.  ""It's happened.  It's wrong, and we're just trying and deal with it the best we can."" Lane's girlfriend, Sarah Harper, posted an emotional tribute on Facebook, saying ""you will always be mine and in a very special and protected place in my heart."" Friends and strangers alike posted condolences on another Facebook page, honoring the slain baseball player. ""Such a sad waste of a young man's life,"" one poster wrote. ""Know that many Americans are sorry for this tragedy and want justice for Chris,"" wrote another. ""God bless.""

"One thing makes Scottish photographer David Yarrow's work stand out from a world of wildlife photography -- a unique point of view. African elephants tower over you, lions stare balefully into your eyes, tigers look up from the water and rhinoceros charge straight at you. It can be a bit unsettling -- this feeling of feeling a little close to the animal. The unusual angles are the result of hours of research and elaborate planning, as well as countless trial and error in the field. Yarrow's new book, ""Encounter,"" gathers 87 of his most stunning images, taken in some of the most remote parts of the world, in the dreariest of seasons, in the most dramatic light. We spoke with the photographer at a recent exhibit in Hong Kong -- where his larger images were selling for more than $15,000 -- where he'd come just after a show at the Saatchi Gallery in London. CNN: What's been your most gratifying experience in the field? David Yarrow: With these animals you've got to photograph them in a way that they haven't been seen, or else the shot comes out boring. The shark photo was the result of 30 hours of waiting on a boat deck in Cape Town. It's impossible to know when the shark will come out of the water, so you have to focus on the baby seals and hope a shark is eying it too. More: 9 not-in-the-guidebook Africa safari tips . Sharks only predate out of the water if the waters are calm and they'll only do it in the first hour after sunrise, and this only happens off Cape Town in July. The first few days I went out, there was nothing. But the belief that you'll (get the shot), to never give up, is important. CNN: There's a shot of a lioness we can't stop looking at. David Yarrow: I worked for a long time for the shot of the lioness. We scented the camera casing in Old Spice and she came straight up to the camera. Perhaps my most important work in this exhibition is the photograph of the rhinoceros. Rhinoceros have these amazing jawlines that you don't usually get to see because they are not photographed from angles where you can see them. For this photo I set up the camera in the watering hole, to get this unusual angle, and got this shot at night at 10 p.m. after days of failure. CNN: How about frightening encounters? David Yarrow: The only moment of terror I've had was when I met a bear in Alaska. You really aren't supposed to be on your own, but I was, and it was a big grizzly that had just come back from eating salmon. Thank goodness it wasn't hungry. You're told what to do when you meet a bear -- you're not supposed to run away, you're supposed to talk to them. My heard was pounding so hard and it was difficult to get anything to come out of my mouth but then I started talking. ""Hello Mr. Bear, how are you."" And then it just looked at me and walked away. CNN: What's your favorite time of year to take pictures? David Yarrow: It depends on what I am photographing. For Africa, I like to go in October. It's the end of the dry season and you get these big thunderclouds for a backdrop. You don't want blue skies when you are photographing -- blue skies are boring -- and you can't get these dramatic shots of light with blue skies.

Not that it's not cold -- I still got frostbite -- but it's better than other months. And then I like to go to Japan in January. I go shoot the snow monkeys. CNN: Which cameras do you use? David Yarrow: Nikons -- D3S and D800. CNN: Do you travel alone or with people? David Yarrow: I go alone. People usually don't want to go when and where I'm going. I want to go when it's raining, and where no one's around! CNN: How long does it usually take to get the photograph you want? David Yarrow: You can't just show up on Sunday and expect to leave on Monday. After you do all the research, get to know the animals' habits, then if you turn up on Sunday and get a good picture by Thursday that's a good job. CNN: Where do you recommend for safaris? The prices tell you everything. I like Botswana, Kenya, Zambia and Namibia. I wouldn't recommend South Africa. For photographing, I don't like to go to the parks where they don't let you get out of the car. You can't get the good angles if you stay in the car.

"More than 30 years ago, 6-year-old Etan Patz vanished from a Manhattan street on his way to a school bus stop. His parents never saw him again. The case -- lately reopened by police -- riveted millions. It also changed the country. ""It awakened America,"" said Ernie Allen, president and chief executive officer of the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. ""It was the beginning of a missing children's movement."" The Patz case was the first of several high-profile cases that catapulted concern about missing children to the forefront of national consciousness. Just weeks after Etan disappeared in May 1979, an attacker abducted the first of more than 20 children to be kidnapped and killed in Atlanta, stirring fear until police arrested a suspect two years later. In another case that made headlines, in 1981 someone abducted 6-year-old Adam Walsh from a Florida shopping mall and killed him. The cases received increasing news coverage in a fast-changing landscape that saw a proliferation of media outlets with growing interest in compelling visual images -- such as a heart-rending photo of a smiling child or video of parents pleading for their child's safe return. The actual number of children who were kidnapped and killed did not change -- it's always been a relatively small number -- but awareness of the cases skyrocketed, experts said. ""Interest in the situation exploded,"" said Marc Klaas, whose 12-year-old daughter, Polly, was kidnapped and strangled to death in a 1993 case that also received intense news coverage. ""It really pulled the lid off of America's dirty little secret, the fact that children are being victimized in large numbers,"" he said Friday. The cases also stoked fear, sparked awareness and prompted change from politicians and police. In 1984, Congress passed the Missing Children's Assistance Act. That led to the creation of the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. President Ronald Reagan opened the center in a White House ceremony in 1984. It soon began operating a 24-hour toll-free hotline on which callers could report information about missing boys and girls. Police officers also started to respond more quickly to reports of missing children, experts said. After Etan disappeared, investigators tried what was then a novel technique to try to find him: They put his face on thousands of milk cartons, a technique that would become more common in the next few years. Relatives and authorities also put the images of missing children on billboards and fliers distributed by mail. Those more assertive efforts eventually led to the AMBER alert system, which broadcasts news about missing children on TV, radio, the Internet, mobile phones, lottery tickets and highway signs. That system has helped save 554 children, the federal government says. Most of them were recovered after the first-ever White House Conference on Missing, Exploited and Runaway Children in 2002. Before the dramatic increase in awareness of crimes against children in the 1980s, only a few high-profile cases grabbed the public's attention. Klaas points out that in 1873, after a 4-year-old Philadelphia boy named Charley Ross disappeared, authorities produced the first missing child flier. The 1932 disappearance and killing of Charles Lindbergh Jr., the 20-month-old son of the world-famous aviator, attracted worldwide attention. It resulted in the Lindbergh Law, which permitted federal authorities to chase kidnappers across state lines. Even before the Etan Patz case, groups were working in the 1970s -- largely out of the spotlight -- on the issue of missing children. They advocated tougher rules in cases of children who were abducted by relatives, said Joel Best, professor of sociology and criminal justice at the University of Delaware. Children abducted by relatives, runaways, and abductions by strangers are the three classifications of what came to be repackaged and rebranded by activists as ""missing children"" in the late 1970s and early 1980s, Best said. ""The missing children's movement was the outgrowth of an earlier child-snatching movement,"" Best said. Runaways comprise the largest number of the missing children, Best said, and while there are few abductions by strangers, those ""emotional, wrenching stories"" make an impact. Lisa Cohen, author of ""After Etan: The Missing Child Case that Held America Captive, said the Etan Patz case galvanized media-saturated New York. So did his photo, which Cohen called a ""beautiful"" shot made by his photographer father, Stan. ""A picture is worth a thousand words,"" she said. Cohen said people empathized with the angst of Stan and his wife Julie -- seen by TV viewers and newspapers readers as normal, intelligent and wise people. The case never ended, the story was never over, and the news outlets never stopped covering it. ""It started a ball rolling,"" she said. ""There was a real momentum."" Barbara Friedman, associate professor of University of North Carolina's School of Journalism and Mass Communication, said such ""heinous crimes are always newsworthy"" and ""have been reported in the press for as long as there has been a press."" ""As media became more plentiful and visual in the 1980s, child abductions and child murders allowed for the kinds of images that are at once intimate and universal -- like school photos and grieving families,"" Friedman said. ""The use of milk cartons as another form of media to locate missing children was a way to bring the issue into the family space -- the breakfast table -- heightening awareness as well as anxieties."" Etan's family and Adam Walsh's parents have been particularly media savvy, she said, as they kept their cases front and center before the public and law enforcement. ""They were strategically and actively engaged in cultivating their attention. And in the age of the 24-hour news cycle, there were more reporters looking for substantive news stories and more space to fill,"" she said. The case raised consciousness but also stirred fear. ""I think it ended an era of innocence in this country,"" Allen said. ""Parents around the nation saw how it happened and thought, 'But for the grace of God, my child.'""","The Patz disappearance was one of several high-profile cases .

"The cosmetics section of any department store anywhere in the world might usually be the first thing you encounter when you walk through the door, but in China it's often a mirror maze on a vast and dazzling scale. There are serried ranks of demonstrations as shop assistants jostle for attention armed with French moisturizers, South Korean all-in-one BB creams and Japanese lip glosses and violet eye shadows. If department stores in Asia are the battle ground for its emerging middle classes, then the cosmetics counter is its front line. Big demand . In China, cosmetics now outstrips groceries as the biggest selling item in its department stores, according to a report from Fung Business Intelligence Center. In 2013, Chinese women, and increasingly men, spent 162.5 billion yuan ($26 billion) on cosmetics in an industry that showed 13.3% growth year-on-year, according to the same report citing figures from Euromonitor International. Japan's annual beauty and personal care market is still the largest in the region at about $50 billion, second in the world only to the United States (which is about $70 billion), according to Euromonitor International. But China's 150 million-strong middle class is closing the gap fast. For them, however, ground zero in terms of models of beauty is increasingly South Korea. While South Korea's domestic market is only a third the size of China, in terms of soft power the country punches well above its weight thanks to Asia's insatiable appetite for Korean drama series and their stars. China's middle class is expected to grow to 500 million within a decade. By 2030 around one billion people in China could be middle class -- as much as 70% of its projected population, according to a report from EY. In terms of brands, according to Euromonitor, L'Oréal China continued to hold the leading position in the Chinese cosmetics market in 2013 with a value share of 34%. And while South Korean brands might be little known outside the region, thanks to the popularity of K-pop and Korean soap operas -- whose stars such as Song Hye-kyo and Kim Hyun-joong and Yoona of Girls' Generation are household names in the Asia-Pacific region -- Korean beauty brands are now the hottest ticket item in China. Star power . One Korean brand in particular, Laneige (meaning the ""the snow"" in French) and made by South Korea's AmorePacific Corp, is popular among China's middle classes. With its blue and white design and French cachet, the skincare product benefits from the soft power of being South Korean and, more importantly, cheaper. Vivienne Rudd, director of global innovation at market researcher Mintel, said South Korean beauty and personal care retail market posted 5.8% growth year-on-year to 2013 compared with just 2.1% for the UK and 3.9% for the US. ""The success of South Korean brands has a lot to do with Chinese consumers copying the style of South Korean soap opera and music stars,"" Rudd told CNN. ""They'll even go so far as to get the particular products being used by these stars. The stores will try to get in the exact shades that South Korean actresses are using."" She said the same way that H&M and Zara will get catwalk styles in quickly, South Korean retailers will do the same with cosmetics. ""This is particularly true with lip color,"" Rudd said. Hot market . Increasingly, however, South Korea is setting the standard for the growing market in skincare products, creating the all-in-one BB creams -- which contain tints, moisturizer and even sunblock -- that have become so popular in Asia. ""South Korea is really the hot market for innovation and it's even overtaken markets like Japan as the place where everyone looks for the experts in skincare. The Chinese are fascinated by facial skincare and by face color cosmetics,"" Rudd said. ""South Korean women are very much held up as the standard of beauty across Asia."" Despite the coverage that South Korean brands have received recently, it is still brands from Europe and the U.S. that rule the roost in China. Beauty expertise . ""Western brands such as L'Oreal still have the brand recognition in China,"" Rudd said, adding that because South Korean brands have been slowing recently, they have been marketing more aggressively in the Chinese market with products aimed directly at Chinese consumers. Apart from creating brands that build on the idea that South Korea has a special expertise in terms of Asia beauty, South Korean cosmetics are seen as lighter and more fun than their Western counterparts. ""They are very quick to use catchy new ingredients, thick textures and they're very careful with their pricing,"" she said. In the meantime, however, Chinese brands have not been slow to sell in their own markets with brands such as Shanghai Jahwa emerging as a major competitor to Western brands, especially third and fourth-tier cities in China. ""There's a certain cachet with French brands, however, and it's amusing to see Chinese brands creating names in Chinese that, when pronounced phonetically, sound very much like French names,"" Rudd said.

"Three weeks after Malaysia Airlines Flights 370 set off from Kuala Lumpur, search aircraft set off Saturday from Australia -- hoping to, finally, find the Boeing 777 in the southern Indian Ocean where experts now believe it ended up. The area that search teams -- including a Chinese Ilyushin IL-76 and an Australian P-3 Orion that set off Saturday morning from Perth -- are now focusing on is 1,100 kilometers (680 miles) to the northeast from where they'd been concentrating for more than a week, and it's closer to the Australian coast. This change is thanks to a new analysis of satellite data that Australian authorities say show the commercial airliner could not have flown as far south as once thought. Saturday's renewed search comes days after Japan and Thailand both said they'd sent new satellite images to Malaysia showing separate debris fields that could be related to the plane, which vanished with 239 people aboard. Air Vice-Marshal Kevin Short, commander of Joint Forces New Zealand, told CNN's Erin Burnett five of the dispatched aircraft ""located debris in their search area"" on Friday.  Some of the spottings were ""hundreds of miles away"" from each other, although Short said this vast expanse is ""not unusual"" given the ocean conditions and the time passed since the airplane's purported crash. That includes 11 small objects spotted by one of his military's P-3 planes. CNN's Kyung Lah, who went out on a U.S. Navy P-8 search plane Friday, said the crew of that plane spotted white objects, orange rope and a blue bag. ""At one point, sure, everybody on board got a little excited, but it's impossible to tell from that distance what anything is,"" she said. Aircraft setting off Saturday will try to relocate those objects, take photos of them for analysis, and direct four ships in the area ""to their exact location,"" according to Short. But again, the world must wait -- there's no confirmation that anything spotted from the air so far has anything to do with the missing airliner, which authorities have been hunting since early March. ""We should not underestimate the difficulty of this work (in) an extraordinarily remote location,"" Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said Saturday. ""... While we are throwing everything that we have at it, the task goes."" The Australian Maritime Safety Authority stressed what's been detected so far ""cannot be verified or discounted as being from MH370 until they are relocated and recovered by ships,"" six of which are to arrive Saturday in the new search area. They could be flotsam, like one distinctive piece of fishing gear spotted in the revised zone. This was not the first time it turned out suspected debris ended up being unrelated to the mystery plane: A Chinese aircraft reported spotting possible aircraft debris early in the search, but that sighting turned out to be nothing. Still, Short said, ""Finding debris ... gives a lot more hope."" Malaysia plane saga: Your questions answered . Better conditions . The new search zone remains vast -- roughly 123,000 square miles (319,000 square kilometers). It is still also remote -- 1,150 miles (1,850 kilometers) west of Perth. But John Young of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said conditions there are ""likely to be better more often"" than they were in the old search area, where poor weather grounded flights two days this week. Planes will be able to spend more time in the air because the new search zone is closer to land, Young said. U.S. flight crews involved in the search aren't frustrated or disillusioned by the sudden change in the search, Cmdr. William Marks of the Navy's U.S. 7th Fleet said. ""For the pilots and the air crews, this is what they train for,"" he said. ""They understand it."" Marks told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Friday night that finding the debris is just part of the goal. Oceanographers could then analyze data about current, winds and more, then, to chart where they believe the bulk of the plane lies deep underwater . ""Finding the debris in of itself is OK. But it's working backwards to that starting point,"" Marks said aboard the USS Blue Ridge. ""And this area will be, hopefully, much better (than the previous search area) for that."" If and when the body of the 777 is found, the question still remains: Why did it go down? That may not be answered until investigators undertake the arduous process of retrieving the aircraft and trying to, literally, piece together what happened to it. Wasted time? Some analysts have raised their eyebrows at the sudden search area shift. ""Really? That much debris and we're not going to have a look at it to see what that stuff might be?"" said David Gallo of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, who helped lead the search for the flight recorders from Air France Flight 447, which crashed into the Atlantic Ocean in 2009. Others lamented the amount of time, money and resources that were spent in the old search area. ""This is time that has been wasted, there's no question,"" said CNN aviation analyst Miles O'Brien. Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein disputed that suggestion. ""I don't think we would've done anything different from what we have done,"" he said. CNN safety analyst David Soucie said it was ""a good sign"" that experts had adjusted their assumptions. ""Assumptions are the key to all of this,"" he said. ""If you assume something and you end up with a final conclusion, you have to constantly review that."" Vast, evolving search . The shifting hunt for Flight 370 has spanned oceans and continents. It started in the South China Sea between Malaysia and Vietnam, where the plane went out of contact with air traffic controllers. When authorities learned of radar data suggesting  the plane had turned west across the Malay Peninsula after losing contact, they expanded the search into the Strait of Malacca. When those efforts proved fruitless, the search spread north into the Andaman Sea and northern Indian Ocean. It then ballooned dramatically after Malaysia announced March 15 that satellite data showed the plane could have flown along two huge arcs, one stretching northwest into the Asian landmass, the other southwest into the Indian Ocean. The search area at that point reached nearly 3 million square miles. On Monday, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said that further analysis of the data had led authorities to conclude the plane went down in the southern Indian Ocean, far from land. Malaysian officials told the families of those on board that nobody would have survived. But many relatives have said that only the discovery of wreckage from the plane will convince them of the fate of their loved ones. 'Unspeakable challenge' for families .

"He calls himself Jah'Keem Yisrael on Facebook. But he grew up as Alton Nolen, a good kid raised in a loving home, said a woman who identified herself as the mother of the Oklahoma beheading suspect in an online posting. Nolen, 30, is expected to be formally charged in last week's fatal attack at the Moore, Oklahoma, food processing plant from which he'd just been fired. Police accuse him of beheading one woman and attacking another before being shot by the company CEO, also a reserve deputy. Nolen was in stable condition Monday. Charges will include first-degree murder and assault with a deadly weapon, according to Jeremy Lewis, spokesman for the Moore police. The spokesman said Nolen was cooperative and forthcoming with detectives. ""He wasn't trying to hide anything,"" Lewis told CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront."" Nolen allegedly told investigators that he felt oppressed at work -- particularly over not getting a raise, a law enforcement official said. While his Facebook page included images of Osama bin Laden and an apparent beheading, there's no indication that Nolen was motivated by terrorism, a second law enforcement official said. Whatever the motivation, the violent image was at odds with the one offered by those who said they were his sister, mother and friends -- none of whom said violence was part of his personality. ""My son was raised up in a loving home,"" the woman who identified herself as his mother said in a Facebook posting Sunday. ""My son was raised up believing in God. My son was a good kid. I know what they're saying he done, but I'm going to tell you this: That's not my son."" The video was posted to the Facebook page of a woman named Megan Nolen, who said she was Alton Nolen's sister. ""Alton, my brother, he's always been a great person, a loving person,"" Megan Nolen said in the post. ""He's always been a people's person, he's never been a violent person, so for something like this to have happened, we're all still in shock right now."" The brutal attack also seemed out of character to Karla Dunn, who was friends with Nolen's younger siblings, according to CNN affiliate KOCO-TV in Oklahoma City. ""He was really just a normal person,"" Dunn told the station. ""He was polite. If you asked him to do something, he did it. It was like no red flags actually that I could ever think of."" At some point, that no-red-flags life seems to have taken a turn. In 2006, CNN affiliate KOKI-TV in Tulsa reported, Nolen was arrested after a police officer saw him throw bags of crack cocaine and marijuana out a car window as he was being pulled over for traffic violations. Out on probation in 2010, he was stopped for an expired tag when a trooper learned he had outstanding arrest warrants, KOKI reported. He struggled with the trooper, then escaped only to be arrested 12 hours later, the station reported. In 2011, he was convicted on drug, resisting arrest and escape charges and sent to prison. In online prison records related to that incident, authorities note that in addition to a ""Jesus Christ"" tattoo on his chest and praying hands on his right arm, he had the Arabic words for ""peace be upon you"" tattooed on his abdomen. The Facebook page where Nolen posted under the name Yisrael -- confirmed by police to be his -- features a cover photo of fighters holding a machine gun and a rocket propelled grenade launcher. U.S. beheading suspect to be charged . It also features numerous messages related to Islam but offers no hint he was planning an attack or that it had anything to do with his religion. The law enforcement official who spoke to CNN on Monday said Nolen had watched beheading videos, but it was unclear if they were linked to ISIS. And another law enforcement official told CNN on Monday that there was no indication of a link to terror. Nolen's problems at work including getting in trouble for his performance and for trying to convert co-workers to Islam, the second official said. While it's unclear when Nolen himself converted, his Facebook page abruptly changed from posts featuring song lyrics, talk about football and other topics to posts almost exclusively related to Islam in April 2013 -- shortly after he was released from prison. Among the posts are screeds condemning the United States as ""wicked"" for failing to help Palestinians during the recent hostilities with Israel. His last post condemned masturbation. Leaders at the mosque he sometimes attended said he was quiet, not outgoing, and that there was no sign of violent tendencies in his personality, according to KOCO and The Oklahoman newspaper. ""The only time I ever said anything to him was one time,"" Saad Mohammed, spokesman for the Islamic Society of Greater Oklahoma City, told KOCO. ""He was in the mosque and he had his Quran and prayer rug on the floor. And I said, 'Hey, pick it up because I don't want the Quran on the floor.' And he picked it up and he sat down. That's it.""","Suspect was forthcoming, cooperative, police say .

"The skies above China are set to become a lot more crowded as wealth and air travel in the country take-off. China is going to need around 5,000 more commercial jets over the next 20 years to fulfill the needs of the country's burgeoning jet set, according to Randy Tinseth, vice-president of marketing for Boeing Commercial. In 2010, Chinese airlines welcomed aboard 267 million passengers (in 1980 it was just 3.4 million), a number second only to the U.S. (over 500 million). That represented a 15% increase compared to 2009 as the country's airline market steadily heads towards the stratosphere. Airbus and Boeing want to maintain their share of the booming market, but a much talked-about mission to create China's own civil aircraft business is aiming  to challenge their dominance in a few years time. The vanguard of the Chinese project is the C919. It's a single-aisle, 168-seat plane to rival Boeing's 737 and Airbus' A320, the small-sized jets that account for around 65% of global airline sales. Developed by the state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China (Comac), the company hopes it will propel it to a place in the sun among the industry heavyweights. It won't be the first plane developed by Comac that has been in partnership with Canadian firm Bombardier on smaller airliners, but it will have more indigenous design and manufacture features that previous aircraft. Honeywell and GE are among the companies that will supply some of the aircraft's avionics, but having international component makers is something that has been a common part of the aviation industry for many years, says Sivi Govindasamy, Asia Managing Editor of Flightglobal Group. ""It's geared towards bringing pride to China by competing in a very visible market segment. Its so they can say, 'We can do this, and do this darned well.'"" Just how well is unknown, as the C919 only exists in model form at present. From its current advanced design stage, a test plane is scheduled to be flying in 2014, with 2016 targeted for the first delivery. A spokesperson for Comac says that it has so far secured orders for 215 planes and will announce new deals at the Singapore Airshow later this month. Those in the aviation world are already taking note, but  ultimately its success will come down to the bottom-line, suggest Govindasamy, and how much it will cost to buy and operate. ""When an airline buys an aircraft it really has to look at its economics because profit margins are so thin. Anything that helps them save money, they'll do it,"" says Govindasamy. ""How much money (the C919) will be able to save airlines is still not clear, especially as both Boeing and Airbus have come up with re-engineered variants of the 737 and A320."" China's three state-owned giants, Air China, China Southern  and China Eastern will be the principle recipients of the planes currently on Comac's book. Read how China's low-cost carriers are taking off . Last year low-coats carrier Ryanair was the one western airline to indicate it was considering purchasing the C919, but Govindasamy believes that most international airlines will be playing a wait-and-see game. ""If you look at any aircraft program around the world, the very first aircraft of a family generally doesn't tend to be the best,"" says Govindasamy. ""You would have to come up with a second variant that would improve the first substantially. Only once the aircraft is out there and performing can those improvements be made. So a lot of people are looking at what they might do afterwards. That's a good ten to 15 years away.""","Comac C919 plane set to rival Boeing 737 and  Airbus A320 .

"Australia has long prided itself on its commitment to fairness. It is a signatory to a range of international conventions intended to protect the vulnerable and has in the past provided sanctuary for those seeking refuge, most notably in the wake of the Vietnam War. In recent years, however, successive Australian governments have adopted increasingly punitive measures to deter asylum seekers from coming to Australia by boat. This is despite Australia hosting relatively low numbers of refugees. Now the Australian government has adopted a military response to the arrival of boats: its Operation Sovereign Borders is led by a three-star general and implemented by Australian Navy and Customs personnel. Boats attempting to bring asylum seekers to Australian territory are intercepted and either towed or escorted back to Indonesian waters. If an intercepted boat is unseaworthy, Australia may transfer asylum seekers to lifeboats, with limited provisions, and release them close to Indonesian waters. They then have no choice but to return to Indonesia. In implementing this extraordinary policy, Australia has entered Indonesian waters on a number of occasions, sparking protest from Indonesia over incursions into its sovereign territory. Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of Australia's policy is its failure to identify and protect refugees among the asylum seekers it intercepts at sea, despite its obligation under the Refugee Convention to protect refugees from being returned to persecution. As Indonesia is not a party to the Refugee Convention, Australia has no assurance that refugees returned to Indonesia will not be deported to their home countries where they face harm. Offshore processing . A further troubling aspect of the policy is the refusal to process the claims of those arriving by boat in Australia. Asylum seekers are transferred to the Pacific island nations of Nauru and PNG's Manus Island for detention and processing within 48 hours of arriving in Australian territory. The detention centers on Nauru and Manus Island are grossly overcrowded, lack adequate health services, are prone to outbreaks of disease and have inadequate water and sanitation. Asylum seekers have engaged in self-harm and attempted suicide. The centers have been criticized by Amnesty International and the UNHCR for not meeting required protection standards. In fact, the Australian Minister for Immigration and Border Control has conceded that Australia is unable to guarantee the safety of every asylum seeker in the PNG detention facility. The stark reality is that a young Iranian asylum seeker, Reza Berati, was murdered on Manus Island in February 2014. Asylum seekers have reported living in constant fear in detention and staying awake in shifts to watch over each other; and many asylum seekers have suffered serious injuries there. The situation in the Nauru detention center is equally grave. Asylum seekers burnt down a significant portion of the detention facility in July 2013, there have been allegations of sexual assault and the UNHCR has highlighted the gross inadequacies of the detention centre, particularly for children. Who's responsible? Disingenuously, Australia has attempted to argue that it only plays a support role in the facilities and has no responsibility for asylum seekers in these detention centers because Nauru and PNG are sovereign nations. However, Australia has clear power and effective control in the facilities. It is responsible for selecting and transferring asylum seekers to the centers and for their day-to-day operation. Australia is also solely responsible for the high financial costs of running these detention centers. It pays for the operation and service provision at the centers, pays a visa fee in Nauru for every asylum seeker detained or resettled there and is paying the legal costs PNG is incurring to fight the Constitutional challenge to the Manus Island detention center. Australia's clear power and effective control in the centers means that it has certain responsibilities under international law to the detained asylum seekers. By failing to determine the suitability of detention for each individual detainee and exposing asylum seekers to unacceptable conditions, Australia is arbitrarily detaining asylum seekers and subjecting them to ""cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment,"" according to Amnesty International. Such treatment violates its obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Further, the current indefinite detention of children in Nauru places Australia in violation of its obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child and Operation Sovereign Borders targets asylum seekers who come to Australia by boat, in violation of Australia's obligation under the Refugee Convention to refrain from punishing refugees for their mode of arrival in a country. Resettlement plans . Australia has vowed not to resettle any of the refugees it sends to Nauru and PNG. Nauru has agreed to issue five-year visas to refugees processed in Nauru and PNG has also indicated a willingness to resettle refugees processed in that country. In addition, Australia has reached in-principle agreement with Cambodia to resettle some of the refugees processed in Nauru. Relying on impoverished nations, which may not be in a position to protect the rights or safety of refugees, is deeply concerning. The Australian government's unwillingness to resettle refugees in Australia is another reminder of the deliberate harshness of its asylum policies. These extreme measures are intended to make asylum in Australia an unattractive option for the vulnerable people who may wish to seek protection. They repudiate the country's reputation for fairness and commitment to human rights.","Australia has adopted increasingly punitive measures to deter asylum seekers .

"Ukrainian authorities and pro-Russia rebels in eastern Ukraine agreed on a complete ceasefire and buffer zone early Saturday in talks in Belarus, Russia's state-run RIA-Novosti news agency reported. Both sides also agreed to move heavy weaponry back from the front lines of the conflict, which had been raging from April until a preliminary truce was reached two weeks ago. That ceasefire has been shaky and interspersed with fighting that is at times heavy. The new deal -- hammered out at talks in Minsk by representatives of Russia, the Ukrainian government, rebel leaders and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe -- sets out nine provisions for a more lasting ceasefire, RIA Novosti said. The ""Minsk memorandum,"" read out by former Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma, includes: a bilateral ceasefire; no movement of military forces beyond the front line as of September 19; no use of weapons or offensive action; heavy weaponry to be moved back at least 15 kilometers (nine miles) from the front line, to create a 30-kilometer buffer zone. The provisions also include a ban on the use of heavy weaponry in residential areas; a ban on flights over the buffer zone except by the OSCE, which has been monitoring implementation of the ceasefire; and the withdrawal of all foreign fighters and military equipment from Ukrainian territory -- to be monitored by the OSCE. Ukraine and the West say Russia has given heavy weaponry and training to the rebels, as well sending Russian troops over the border to fight alongside them. Russia's President Vladimir Putin denies the claims. Russia sends convoy . Meanwhile, a third Russian humanitarian-aid convoy has arrived in the city of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine after crossing the border early Saturday, Russia's state-run Itar-Tass reported. The 200 trucks are carrying food, power generators, medical supplies, clothes and bottled water, according to the report. According to Itar-Tass, Ukrainian authorities and representatives from International Committee of the Red Cross were offered the chance to inspect the latest convoy but ""refused without offering any reasons."" Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council spokesman Col. Andriy Lysenko told reporters in Kiev on Saturday that Russia had informed Ukraine that it would send a humanitarian aid convoy but that it had not asked for permission. Lysenko was not able to confirm that the convoy had crossed the border. He said separatists control the Izvarino checkpoint through which the convoy reportedly passed and that Ukrainian border guards would not be able to inspect the trucks' contents as they do not man the crossing. Two previous convoys entered Ukraine from Russia without the permission of Ukrainian authorities or checks on what the trucks were carrying. They delivered supplies to the city of Luhansk, like Donetsk a stronghold for the pro-Russia rebels who have been battling Ukrainian forces for control of the area. Poroshenko 'fully satisfied' with U.S. help . On Thursday, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko advocated before a joint session in Congress in Washington for greater support to his military, which has been battling pro-Russia rebels in his country's east. The United States has sent nonlethal aid such as blankets and night night vision goggles, but Poroshenko requested help arming his troops -- a request that once again was rebuffed. Poroshenko, who also met with  U.S. President Barack Obama, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that Ukraine was ""fully satisfied"" with the offer of U.S. help received. He also stressed that the crisis in eastern Ukraine could not be resolved by military means alone. A rocket attack by pro-Russia rebels killed 10 civilians and injured 12 others in eastern Ukraine on Wednesday, the Ukrainian military said. In Ukraine this week, lawmakers passed legislation giving ""special status"" to rebel-controlled areas in the eastern Luhansk and Donetsk regions. The measure grants amnesty to the separatists -- but only if they disarm, release hostages and give up occupied buildings. The new law also provides protections for Russian-language speakers in the region. Sanctions pressure Russia . Russia's incursion into Ukraine has spurred several rounds of economic sanctions from the United States and Europe, which have so far failed to persuade Putin to change course. After Poroshenko's speech to Congress, legislators on the Senate Foreign Relations panel voted unanimously to advance a bipartisan package of new aid to Ukraine that includes both military and non-military assistance to the country. The measure allocates $350 million for the effort. At the same time, the Ukrainian Parliament and the European Union ratified a political and economic agreement that also includes free trade provisions, though they won't come into force until the start of 2016. Former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych's decision to drop the EU Association agreement late last year in favor of closer ties with Moscow triggered the popular unrest that led to his ouster in February, followed by Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region a month later and the deadly conflict in eastern Ukraine. Moscow is opposed to Ukraine's pivot toward the West, which has been pushed forward by Poroshenko.","Russia did not ask for permission to send in its aid convoy, Ukrainian official says .

"He was a basketball-loving kid from the Midwest who turned into a jihadi-fighting terrorist in Syria -- and then died there. Exactly what spurred Douglas McAuthur McCain's metamorphosis remains murky. But while his radicalization and death have stunned loved ones back home, his actions abroad have raised fears that other Americans may follow suit. Here's what we know about the 33-year-old man who died while fighting for ISIS, the radical militant group that has captured swaths of Iraq and Syria and spawned major concerns in the United States: . U.S. on alert amid new claim of American killed in Syria . He grew up in Minnesota . McCain grew up in the Minneapolis suburb of New Hope, his friend Isaac Chase said. The two lived in the same New Hope apartment building and became fast friends. ""When I first moved here, I didn't know anyone, so I went to the park and I would see him and his brother and a bunch of other people playing basketball, and he asked me if I wanted to play,"" Chase said. ""We just hung out pretty much from 10 o'clock in the morning all the way until nighttime. We'd just play basketball and talk. ... He was an older guy that I looked up to. He was actually a good dude."" Chase remembers McCain as a nice, quiet young man, but one who was looking for purpose in life. When Chase joined the Air Force in 2007 and served in Iraq, McCain was impressed that his friend was making something of his life and wanted to do the same, Chase said. But after learning that McCain died while fighting for ISIS, which is trying to establish an Islamic state across Iraq and Syria, his friend was bewildered. ""It just hurts a little bit knowing that if he was over there and I was over there at the same time, we would've been going against each other,"" Chase said. ""That's what hurts the most because he was a good person, and I just don't understand why anyone would do anything to the U.S."" His family is stunned . And he was raised by good parents, Chase added. He said McCain's mother attended church regularly, while the father is deceased. Ken McCain described the nephew he knew as ""a good person, loved his family, loved his mother, loved his faith"" -- the latter being a reference to Christianity he practiced before his conversion to Islam several years ago. Opinion: When Americans leave for jihad . The family wasn't alarmed by his conversion. But McCain's Facebook posts sympathetic to ISIS got relatives' attention, the uncle said. ""We are devastated, and we are just as surprised as the country is,"" Ken McCain said of the news his nephew had become a jihadi in Syria. But not every family member believes Douglas McCain joined ISIS, a group with tactics so brutal even al Qaeda has disowned it. ""We're from Chicago. We grew up in Minnesota,"" his cousin Kenyata McCain told CNN affiliate KARE. ""He's not a terrorist. That's crazy."" ""His religion was very important to him, but those people -- the ISIS people -- they don't represent what my cousin's beliefs are or were at all."" Kenyata McCain -- who said Douglas commented about her sons growing up on a Facebook photo a few days before his death -- wondered if her cousin may have gotten caught up in the wrong crowd. ""Why was he in Syria? ... What kind of people was he hanging around? I feel like maybe it was the people he was hanging out with because that's not who he is. He's not ISIS,"" she said. Spent time in California, Sweden, Turkey . Douglas McCain didn't take a straight path from Minnesota to Syria, from Christianity to an extreme brand of Islam, from ""good person"" to accused terrorist. Physically, he moved around some as well. That includes time in Southern California, where he attended San Diego City College, according to spokesman Jack Beresford. At the beginning of this decade, McCain also spent time in Sweden. An acquaintance of his in that Scandinavian nation, Kevin Tornstrom Kohlin, remembers him as ""a really good basketball player"" and a ""fun guy who spread a lot of good energy."" ""I never noticed him giving any bad energy, at all, to anybody,"" Kohlin said from Vasteras, Sweden. ""Everybody who met him, of those I know, remember him the same way."" McCain appeared to have no problem with anyone's religion -- including that of Kohlin, who is Christian. While all his stops aren't publicly known, uncle Ken McCain did say that his nephew was in Turkey when he last touched base with him a few months ago. Not coincidentally, Turkey borders Syria. From hip-hop dancer to jihadist: How dad tracked down son in Syria . U.S. government had been monitoring him . McCain had several run-ins with local law enforcement in Minnesota since 2000, according to the Hennepin County Sheriff's Office. These include arrests for disorderly conduct, speeding, driving after revocation, theft by swindle and giving an officer false information. And in 2003, he paid a $250 fine after pleading guilty to having marijuana in a motor vehicle, according to court records. Still, these were minor issues, certainly not matters of national security. In the early 2000s, though, Douglas McCain did come to the federal government's attention, according to a U.S. official. He was associated over the years with numerous people who authorities were watching -- including one from Minnesota who ended up dying in Somalia while fighting as a jihadi -- the official said. But there was no indication that McCain was involved in anything nefarious during his time in the Midwest. Things changed, though, as the years went by. U.S. counterterrorism investigators had been looking into his activities for some time before his death, a U.S. official said. McCain was on a list of Americans who are believed to have joined militant groups and who would be stopped and subjected to additional scrutiny if he traveled. It's not clear when McCain got on that list. Moreover, U.S. authorities did not learn that he was in Turkey until he was already there, according to a U.S. official. How and why he moved on to Syria, how and why he became a jihadist and joined ISIS, befuddles those who knew him back in the United States. Some clues about his final days, weeks and months may lie in a Twitter account reported to be that of McCain's. A June 9 message read: ""I will be joining you guys soon."" He followed up the next day, ""I'm with the brothers now."" Then came this perhaps telling retweet, on June 26: ""It takes a warrior to understand a warrior. ""Pray for ISIS."" Who is the ISIS? How ISIS is overshadowing al Qaeda .","Retweet from McCain's purported account refers to warriors; says ""pray for ISIS""

The 33-year-old was last seen at the JW Marriott Desert Springs Resort & Spa on Thursday night after a company dinner. Meza was reported missing after he failed to show up for various meetings the following day. ""I spoke to him ... I was the last conversation per his telephone records ... on Thursday night around 11:20 p.m.,"" said his wife Diane. ""It was late on a work night.

"An X-ray shows a bullet lodged in a baby's head. The image would be chilling enough without knowing the child was still in its mother's womb when it became the target of snipers hiding in the shadows in northern Syria. The mother survived. Her baby didn't. And it's not the only one. Volunteer doctor David Nott, a British surgeon who's worked in several Syrian hospitals with the charity Syria Relief, says snipers are playing a ""targeting game,"" and heavily pregnant women are on the hit list. ""Most of the children removed were seven, eight, nine months gestation, which meant it was fairly obvious to anybody that these women were pregnant."" Young children are also being targeted, Nott said. Polio cases suspected in Syria . Photos provided to CNN by Syria Relief show a young girl with painted nails lying in a hospital bed with head wounds. She appears no more than five years old. Another, around the same age, lies under a green sheet with a gaping wound to her forehead. Nott said 90% of surgeries he performed on any given day were for sniper wounds. On some days, the wounds were suspiciously similar. ""After a while we noticed that there were certain trends going on,"" Nott said. ""We had some days, say, 10 or 15 gunshot wounds of which eight or nine of them were targeted in one particular area. So for example, one day, we received say 15, 16 gunshot wounds and of that eight to nine were targeted in the left groin only. ""Then the following day they were targeted in the right groin only. So it seemed to me like there was some of thing going on -- a game going on -- between the snipers."" Knott said other local doctors he worked with told him they'd heard snipers were receiving little presents -- like packets of cigarettes -- for people they'd shot during the day. UK Foreign Secretary Hague: No role for Bashar al-Assad in future Syria . Desperate dash for supplies . In video obtained by CNN from Aleppo, men, women and children try to outrun snipers' bullets as they cross from the regime-controlled enclave of the city to rebel-held areas. They risk their lives because food and provisions are on the rebel side. But their homes and families are on the regime side. Desperate, they make a dash for supplies. Not everyone makes it through. It is a scene reminiscent of another conflict: Bosnia. Its capital, Sarajevo, was literally under siege from snipers of the Bosnian Serb Army for more than four years. But during that war in the early 1990s, the United Nations operated humanitarian corridors to ensure that, despite the fighting, aid still got through. Nott also volunteered in Bosnia and described his relief back then at seeing extra supplies trucked in. ""It was wonderful to see the lorries coming in with UNHCR written on them.  And when you saw one of them, you knew that that they were filled with food, provisions and medical aid for the besieged town."" He says Syria desperately needs the same. ""Now is the time to develop a humanitarian corridor to allow health and aid workers to go in, and not feel threatened on the way in and not feel threatened on the way out,"" he said. ""I felt very scared going in and coming out and this isn't right.""

"For air travelers who like to gripe about being cramped in economy, here comes another warning that they've never had it so good. Airbus has filed a patent application showing detailed renderings of what may be the plane seat of the future. The design shows narrow rows of folding saddle seats with low backrests on which passengers perch rather than recline. The patent application, which makes even the most budget of budget airline seating look luxurious, was published last month and is available for viewing by the public. Are you a window flier or aisle seater? As CNN reported last week, a new study says the vertical passenger seat may be the next big cost-cutting move in aviation. Upright seat designs would allow airlines to pack more passengers into a cabin and provide an affordable alternative to public transportation on short haul flights. The patent says current seating configurations have reached their passenger limit but numbers can be increased by switching to saddle-style designs (presumably stowing travelers in the overhead compartments has been ruled out). It says the saddle format will accommodate four seats into a space previously occupied by three. The Airbus design is somewhat similar to the SkyRider, a perching saddle for planes developed by Italian firm Aviointeriors and unveiled at an expo in 2010. If Airbus is looking for positive feedback for its design, it may struggle. The UK's Daily Telegraph likened the patent to ""the inside of a galley,"" under the headline ""The world's most uncomfortable plane seat?"" An Airbus spokesperson told CNN that the patent didn't necessarily mean it would be saddling up its aircraft anytime soon. ""Airbus files hundreds of patents each year -- this is what innovative companies do,"" Airbus UK head of media relations Robert Gage said via email. ""Many patents never become reality and there is no expectation that this would. It is really to preserve an idea and has not developed beyond this stage."" Gage said that even if the designs were to be developed, it would be up to airlines would choose the seating configurations and type.","Airbus publishes patent for folding saddle seats with low backrests .

"(CNN) -- Israel pledged to limit the use of munitions containing white phosphorus and make greater efforts to protect civilians during conflicts, in a report this week to the United Nations. The Israeli military was roundly criticized for firing white phosphorus shells over densely populated areas during the Gaza offensive that began in late 2008. White phosphorus ignites and burns, creating white smoke when it is exposed to oxygen. Militaries use it as a smoke screen to protect troops during combat. If it comes in contact with skin, white phosphorus creates an intense and persistent burn. In making the changes, Israel said it had done nothing wrong. ""The use of smoke-screening munitions containing phosphorus during the Gaza operation ... was consistent with Israel's obligations under the Law of Armed Conflict,"" Israel said in the report. Yet, as a result of ""the lessons learned"" in the aftermath of the Gaza offensive, the report said the Israeli military ""is in the process of establishing permanent restrictions on the use of munitions containing white phosphorus in urban areas."" In a report entitled ""Rain of Fire: Israel's Unlawful Use of White Phosphorus in Gaza"" released last year, Human Rights Watch said Israel's firing of white phosphorus shells over densely populated areas during the Gaza offensive ""was indiscriminate and is evidence of war crimes."" ""In Gaza, the Israeli military didn't just use white phosphorus in open areas as a screen for its troops,"" said Fred Abrahams, a senior emergencies researcher for Human Rights Watch. ""It fired white phosphorus repeatedly over densely populated areas, even when its troops weren't in the area and safer smoke shells were available. As a result, civilians needlessly suffered and died."" The offensive, called Operation Cast Lead, was launched December 27, 2008 and ended January 17, 2009 with a ceasefire. Of the 1,453 people estimated killed in the conflict, 1,440 were Palestinian, including 431 children and 114 women, a U.N. report said. The 13 Israelis killed included three civilians and six soldiers killed by Hamas, and four soldiers killed by friendly fire, it said.","White phosphorus is used to create smoke screen for troops .

"[Breaking news update 1:35 p.m. ET] . President Barack Obama knew there would be ""glitches"" and said ahead of time there would be problems in the October 1 rollout of a key part of his health care initiative, but ""there is no question that we did not anticipate the scale of problems with the website,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said on Wednesday. Separately, Carney said the Department of Health and Human Services will begin conducting daily briefings on Thursday about progress toward fixing problems with the Healthcare.gov website. [Original story moved at 8:56 a.m. ET] . Before it even launched, red flags went up about the Obamacare website. Health insurance companies complained about it, and the site crashed during a test run. But nobody told the President of any of it, the nation's health chief told CNN. Kathleen Sebelius said President Barack Obama didn't hear that there may be problems with the sign-up portal for his signature health care law until it went live on October 1. That's when the site nosedived into a technical abyss. Rough Obamacare rollout: 4 reasons why . In an exclusive interview with CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta, the Health and Human Services secretary admitted that her department and the White House are displeased with the technically botched website's rollout. ""No one could be more frustrated than I am and the President,"" she said. The site was supposed to make it simple for people to search and sign up for new health care policies, but instead it's been clunky and, at times, inoperable. And for Sebelius, that's disappointing. ""We're not at all satisfied with the workings of the website,"" she said. ""We want it to be smooth and easy and let consumers compare plans."" Obama: No 'sugarcoating' problems with website . Bringing the 'A-Team' A team of high-tech experts from within the government and from Silicon Valley is going to tackle the issues, Sebelius said. Jeff Zients, acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, will lead the team. So why weren't they brought in before the website launched October 1? ""We (had) hoped that they had their 'A-Team' on the table"" from the start, Sebelius said of the contractors and agencies responsible for the project. But now, she said, ""we want new eyes and ears. We want to make sure that we get all the questions on the table, that we get all the answers and accelerate the fix as quickly as possible."" The secretary attributed some problems to ""extremely high"" volume, saying nearly 20 million people came to the Obamacare website in the first three weeks after its launch. Yet only 500,000 people have created accounts on the website. And not all of them have necessarily enrolled in health care plans. Obamacare applications near half a million . It's not like no one saw this coming. When the website crashed during a test run, just a few hundred users were on it. But the Obama administration went ahead with the launch. Waiting was not an option, Sebelius said. Report: Site failed ahead of rollout . ""There are people in this country who have waited for decades for affordable health coverage for themselves and their families,"" she said. Opinion: Obamacare a disaster that needs fixing . A political lightning rod . Sebelius' comments struck some Republicans as surprising and even odd. ""At this point, she has a lot of questions to answer, and we look forward to her testimony in the House next week,"" said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner. A Senate GOP leadership aide called the situation ""odd."" ""Everyone was surprised by her statement that the President was unaware of the website's failures until a few days into it,"" the aide told CNN. ""They had been claiming that the Obamacare rollout was his top priority and that he was receiving regular updates, which was inaccurate. And he gave remarks on October 1 about how great it was and that people should go sign up,"" the aide said. ""Assuming that he didn't know that the website didn't work, why did they let him make that speech when they knew it had crashed in testing? Did really no one recommend a delay to the President? It just seems odd."" Before the website's launch, Republicans made targeting the program a centerpiece of their agenda. Many insisted they wouldn't vote to fund the entire government unless Obamacare was defunded or delayed. They said that the website's woes show that the Obama administration and the federal government generally aren't capable of executing what the GOP says was an ill-advised program from the get-go. ""God only knows how much money they've spent, and it's a failure,"" Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader, said Sunday on CBS. ""The government isn't going to be able to get this job done correctly."" On the other side, Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire sent a letter to Obama asking that the open enrollment period be extended past March 31, 2014. She also asked that he consider delaying assessment of a penalty to those who don't sign up for any health insurance before the so-called individual mandate kicks in. Even Obama has been critical, insisting Monday that there's ""no excuse for the problems."" But he also said the problems should not amount to a blanket condemnation of the Affordable Care Act. ""Nobody's madder than me about the website not working as well as it should,"" Obama said, ""which means it's going to get fixed."" Calls for resignation . Several top Republicans -- including 2012 vice presidential nominee Rep. Paul Ryan -- have called on Sebelius to step down due to the program's problems. The secretary skirted questions Tuesday about whether she'd step down, saying only that she works ""at the pleasure of the President"" and is committed to her job. ""I think my job is to get this fully implemented and to get the website working right,"" she told Gupta. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett stood up for Sebelius in an interview with CNN's Piers Morgan on Tuesday night. ""I am a friend of Kathleen's, and I'm a friend of her when she's in trouble,"" he said. ""I like Kathleen. I feel sorry for her in the position she's in. Obviously, it's a huge screw-up, but it will get worked out."" Sebelius refused to give a timetable Tuesday as to when the website will be fully operational, but she insisted it's improving every day. ""More people are having an easier time,"" she said, ""and we intend to stay at this until we open the doors wide open."" Rubio calls for delay of Obamacare sign-up deadline . And it's too early to call the rollout a failure, the health secretary said. There's still a long time for people to take advantage in person, by calling or by using the website during the open enrollment period. When that six-month stretch is over, Sebelius said, people can better decide whether this part of Obamacare is a success or a failure.

"Is soccer's glass ceiling finally cracking? French second-tier side Clermont Foot hinted at a new dawn for the sport after appointing the country's first ever professional female coach for a male team. Helena Costa, who was previously in charge of the Iran women's national team, will take over the reins at Clermont next season. The 36-year-old will become the first female coach of a French professional football club, while her appointment, announced Wednesday, represents the first time a team in the top two divisions of one of Europe's big five leagues -- Spain, Germany, England, Italy and France -- has hired a female manager. ""Clermont Foot 63 has chosen Helena Costa to be our new coach,"" a statement confirming the appointment read. ""This appointment will allow Clermont Foot 63 to begin a new era, relying on a group of 17 players currently under contract, which will be added by young players from the club."" The Portuguese will succeed Regis Brouard, who is currently in charge of Clermont but is leaving at the end of the season when his contract expires. Costa, a sports science graduate, has been rewarded following her work with the Iran and Qatar women's national teams, while she also led Benfica's male youth team to two World Youth titles. She also spent time as a scout with Scottish club Celtic. Currently 14th in Ligue 2, Clermontwill introduce Costa to the French media after the season's final set of fixtures. Male chauvinism . While Costa is the first ever female coach in French professional football, Nelly Viennot previously served as an assistant referee in France, also featuring in Champions League games. The English Premier League boasts two high-profile females, with Eva Carneiro fulfilling the role of Chelsea's first-team doctor, while Karren Brady is West Ham's vice chairman. Former England women's national team manager Hope Powell was linked with the Grimsby job in 2009, although she denied that she was ever in the running for the post. In Italy, Carolina Morace took charge of Italian Serie C1 team Viterbese for two matches in 1999. Maria Jose Claramunt, meanwhile, is currently the director of the Spanish national team, however, she is responsible for marketing issues rather than sporting ones. Historically women working in the football industry have had to contend with male chauvinism. Richard Keys and Andy Gray were household names on British broadcaster Sky Sports -- two men who presented football to UK viewers for so long they had become an integral part of the game itself. But both were forced to leave the broadcaster in 2011 shortly after they were caught making derogatory remarks about female match official Sian Massey. Talking near a microphone they thought had been turned off, Gray said: ""Can you believe that? A female linesman. Women don't know the offside rule."" Keys replied: ""Course they don't.""","Clermont Foot appoints Helena Costa as new coach .

"Euro 2012 hosts Ukraine and Poland have told CNN World Sport a documentary accusing football fans from both nations of racism was ""unbalanced and biased."" An investigation by UK television channel the BBC featured right-wing supporters from both countries displaying racist and anti-Semitic attitudes. Footage also appeared to show soccer fans at a match in Ukraine targeting Asian supporters with violence. Former England defender Sol Campbell warned fans not to travel to Poland or Ukraine after seeing the pictures and questioned why both countries were awarded the tournament in the first place. Are Poland and Ukraine ready to host festival of football? But speaking to CNN World Sport, representatives from the governments of Ukraine and Poland said the show was misleading. ""What was aired, in my personal opinion, is unbalanced and biased reporting about the situation in Ukraine,"" Volodymyr Khandogiy, Ukraine's ambassador to the UK, said. ""I would like to say we do not in Ukraine have a problem of that magnitude as it appeared on the screen. ""Racism and racial ideology is against the law and if those young fans were shouting anything close to Nazi slogans they would have been prosecuted. Racism, rather than Ronaldo and Ribery, dominates Euro 2012 storylines . ""Ukraine is very well known for its tolerance and it has a long history of living together with other nationalities. In our national football championship, roughly half of all the players are from Asian, African and Brazilian countries."" The Panorama episode broadcast footage filmed at matches in both Poland and Ukraine that purported to show fans displaying Nazi salutes in the stands and aiming monkey chants at black players. Family members of two players in the England squad -- Arsenal pair Theo Walcott and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain -- have already said they won't be going to the tournament due to fears over racism. But Marcin Bosacki, Polish Foreign Ministry spokesman, told CNN the program was ""cheap journalism."" He said: ""There is a problem with racism and anti-Semitism in Poland but it is blown out of every possible proportion in this material. Italian PM: Suspend Italian soccer leagues . ""They interviewed many people with balanced opinions and they complained today that their voices were not used in this program. ""Do you know how many British tourists come to Poland evry year? 500,000. And do you know how many reports they gave to the British Embassy and consulates about racism in the last three years? Zero. ""We are hospitable and treat all people who come here as friends."" UEFA claim taking high-profile tournaments to different places in Europe helps to tackle any problems regarding discrimination in the host country. In a statement, soccer's European governing body said: ""UEFA Euro 2012 brings the spotlight on the host countries and clearly creates an opportunity to address and confront such societal issues. ""UEFA's 'zero tolerance' approach to racism is still valid both on and off the pitch and ultimately the referee has the power to stop or abandon a match should racist incidents occur."" Piara Power, executive director of the Football Against Racism in Europe organization, said there was still plenty of work to be done in both Poland and Ukraine. ""I think we know the situation in domestic football in both Poland and Ukraine and I'm afraid the documentary hit the nail on the head -- it's a very bad situation,"" he said. ""Nevertheless there is some good work going at grass roots level to make sure that Euro 2012 inside stadiums does not resemble the sort of scenes we saw in the documentary."" Powar said that although the BBC's documentary had provoked a strong reaction in the UK, other countries involved in Euro 2012 would be concerned that UEFA do all they can to ensure a safe tournament. ""There will be mixed teams in the Netherlands, Germany, the French have a lot of black players,"" he added. ""I think all of those teams will be looking at themselves and saying what sort of safety precautions do we need to take? Do our relatives travel or do they stay behind and how do we respond to possible outbreaks of racism? ""We have a procedure with UEFA to deal with these sort of issues and we're fairly clear that it's a good procedure. ""It will work in the right way and I think we'll see a lot of teams and their fans probably getting sanctioned quite heavily by UEFA by the end of the tournament.""","Euro 2012 hosts Ukraine and Poland hit back over claims of racism in their countries .

"A huge chunk of Europe's male population is salivating at the imminent arrival of Euro 2012 -- a month long festival of football between the continent's best soccer sides. But the tournament, arguably second only to the World Cup in scale and prestige, is proving equally popular with the fairer sex, according to new research. For Germany and Italy, two perennial heavyweights in the four-yearly competition, women make up nearly half of the huge support they attract. This is a far greater figure than England, whose domestic Premier League is one of the world's most popular competitions, where the national team's supporter profile contains around 33% females. Pedro Pinto's Euro 2012 predictions . Danny Townsend, from firm Repucom who conducted the survey, says the Premier League has attracted more female fans to the game in recent years, but has a way to go to match its continental rivals. ""In Germany in particular, the national association has been ahead of the game for some time in this sense,"" he told CNN. ""Cultural differences also come into play to a degree, but  you only have to look at the profile of women's football in Germany compared to the UK for an example of the work that has been done. ""Ultimately, it's a major goal for all clubs and organizations to engage more female fans. In most European markets, male interest in football is so incredibly high it is close to reaching a ceiling. ""However the potential for growing female interest is huge -- and, at the end of the day, it equates to more people playing the game and more people investing in the game."" Racism, rather than Ronadlo and Ribery, dominates Euro 2012 storylines . Germany's burgeoning female football fan population contributes to their position at the top of Repucom's table, with 62% of its country's people supporting the national team and 44% of that figure made up of women. Italy are second on the list in terms of well supported nations with 61% of their population willing the Azzuri onto victory -- and just like Germany, 44% of that figure consists of females. Spain, the current European and world champions, can begin their defense in Poland and Ukraine safe in the knowledge that half of their countrymen and women will be dedicated to the cause. But while England can rely on the backing of 15.6 million supporters when Euro 2012 kicks off, that figure only translates to 44% of the adult population. Perhaps for a team that has only won one major title -- the 1966 World Cup -- that is not surprising. Yet France, who took both the 1998 World Cup and the European Championships in 2000, are bottom of the fan mini-league, with only 38% of their nation counting themselves as fans of the national team. According to Townsend, England's poor performances on the pitch in recent years have translated to a drop in fervent fans off it. ""I think if we were to look back over the past 20 years or so, you would expect to find that England's domestic supporter base would rival that of Germany or Italy in terms of the percentage of the population who back the team,"" he said. ""But what is undeniable is that the past couple of years have been very difficult for England on and off the pitch. Naturally, that impacts on the brand even although in aspects such as replica shirt sales, England is still way ahead of its competitors. ""Bringing back the feel-good factor and the pride in the national team has to be considered a major element of manager Roy Hodgson's remit in Poland and Ukraine over the coming weeks.""","New study of soccer fans shows female supporters on rise in Italy and Germany .

"Running the rule over fellow airline passengers; it's as common as stowing your bag under the seat in front of you and fastening your seat belt. Who hasn't spent a few moments sitting at a departure gate wondering who you might be seated next to for the next few hours? You hope it's not the family with the hyperactive child or the nervous flyer who unfortunately, for them and you, is out of valium. Now Dutch airline KLM has tapped into our in-built social screening to offer a service that will let you know more about fellow flyers well before take off. Launched this month as part of their online booking service,  ""Meet & Seat"" allows passengers to link their Facebook or LinkedIn profiles to the seats they choose. The idea is that when picking an aisle or a window seat you can see if the person next to you has similar interests and the potential for stimulating conversation, or if you'll need extra batteries for your noise-cancelling headphones. So far KLM is only letting passengers on flights from Amsterdam to New York, San Francisco and Sao Paolo use the service. The airline says all personal profile details are deleted from the airline's systems 48-hours after the flight. Are you a high-flyer? Take our air travel quiz . For those that aren't so bold and want to be set up with strangers by social media, a website for shy and lovelorn flyers went live earlier this year.

If you're single and you didn't get the other person's name, how can you search for them on the internet or Facebook?"" Scully-Power first thought of the idea last year after meeting his current girlfriend on a flight from Thailand to Sydney. The 31-year-old Australian did get her number and love blossomed, but he thought that more people have probably missed their opportunity than seized it. When researching if there was something in his idea he found there were around 4,000 internet searches each month for ""we met on a plane."" It's early days for the site, but it has clearly stuck a chord with flyers with people from 28 countries posting lonely-heart missives. Some posts even mention flights they took over ten years ago and a fateful missed connection.

"(CNN)It might sound like a Vin Diesel movie, but tennis authorities in Australia are hoping that the FAST4 format, which debuted Monday with an exhibition match between world No. 2 Roger Federer and former Wimbledon and US Open champ Lleyton Hewitt, could ""revolutionize"" the sport. That contest ended in the Swiss star's favor, beating his old friend and rival 4-3 2-3 3-4 4-0 4-3 at Sydney's Qantas Credit Union Arena. This new version of tennis, which marks some of the most significant rule changes in the sport's history, consists of the best-of-three sets with quick changeovers and sudden-death playoffs to prevent tiebreaks from dragging on. The first player to four games wins the set. ""Playing Roger in this new format will be an exciting challenge for both of us and a lot of fun,"" said Hewitt ahead of the match. ""It's a fantastic innovation for tennis, and one that I hope will take off."" The Australian roadshow will decamp to Melbourne next, with Spanish superstar Rafael Nadal taking on three opponents in separate matches Wednesday. First he'll line up against former US Open finalist Mark Philippoussis before taking on current US Open junior champion Omar Jasika, finally playing a best-of-five match against compatriot Fernando Verdasco. New game, new rules . Billed as tennis' answer to cricket's TV-friendly Twenty20, the two formats share more than just a catchy approach to branding. Both take a fast-paced approach to sports that, for the uninitiated, could be considered soporific. Cricket traditionally takes five days to play a Test -- international -- match, and men's singles tennis can last for hours, or in some rare cases, days. Players will also have to hurry during end-changes, as there are no seating breaks and they get a scant 90 seconds to sit in between sets. A couple of more fundamental rule changes, including the removal of the service let rule -- that requires a server to retake their service if the ball hits the net cord -- and the removal of the advantage point. In FAST4, the receiving player gets to choose which side the serve -- for a sudden death ""power"" point -- is directed to at deuce. Faster, glitzier tennis . FAST4 promises to provide some of the extravagance and glamor that, the majors aside, some evidently feel is missing from the sport. Proponents hope that the truncated timeframe -- each set is supposed to last no more than 15 minutes, with games typically not lasting for much longer than an hour -- will allow for a greater number of people to find the time to play tennis. ""The new format is a game changer and is set to revolutionize the game of tennis, particularly at club and social levels,"" Tennis Australia' s chief executive officer Craig Tiley said. ""Time today is precious and this new fast format is perfect for any player who wants to fit their tennis matches into a busy lifestyle."" Tennis Australia high performance coach Craig Morris added: ""Our long term objective in creating a product like FAST4 tennis is to attract more people to the sport, and get more people to play tennis. ""There's no plan to replace traditional tennis, this is a great complementary product that is entertaining for fans and fun to play."" It's not the only innovation that the sport is toying with. The International Premier Tennis League, ""the first city-based professional league in the world, played across four countries,"" debuted in November in 2014.","New, quicker format debuts in Sydney .

"Law enforcement officials in Cuba and the United States are investigating a theft of at least 70 works of art from the island nation with a value totaling more than $1 million, says the Miami art dealer who first reported the heist to U.S. authorities. On Tuesday, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) circulated a list of the missing artworks, which art dealer Ramon Cernuda examined and said would likely be valued at close to $1.5 million. Cernuda first alerted law enforcement officials to the theft in February after buying a painting by a 20th-century Cuban artist for $15,000. After researching the painting, Cernuda said he discovered the work was registered to Havana's National Museum of Fine Arts. He said he contacted officials there who, upon searching their archives, confirmed the painting and others were missing. While no major works were stolen, Cernuda said the case was notable because art theft is relatively rare in Cuba. Museums are tightly guarded and artwork is usually inspected before it leaves the country. ""The theft is so much more complicated than the smuggling out of Cuba,"" Cernuda said. ""To just get the art out of the museum is very complicated."" Cuban authorities have not said whether any arrests have been made, but a statement issued by the Cuban National Council of Cultural Heritage said an investigation showed the artworks were removed from their frames while in storage. Cernuda said the same dealer in Miami who sold him the painting he purchased had another 10 Cuban artworks for sale that appeared to have been crudely cut from their frames. ""It's an obvious tell that something is going on,"" he said. Cernuda said he has turned over the painting he purchased to the FBI, and he said the agency is investigating. Despite chilly relations between the United States and Cuba, Cernuda said he expected any art that is recovered would be returned to the island. ""I am about certain it will go back,"" he said. ""Stolen property is stolen property.""","UNESCO lists at least 70 artworks that are believed to have been stolen .

"(CNN)Novak's Djokovic's preparations for the Australian Open were derailed Thursday by big-serving Croatian Ivo Karkovic as the world number one joined defending Qatar Open champion Rafael Nadal on the sidelines. Karlovic coped the better with the windy conditions to secure a 6-7 7-6 6-4 victory to reach the semifinals, a surprise even to the 35-year-old who described it as ""unbelievable"" in his post-match interview. ""When I arrived here, I didn't expect that one. He wasn't able to show his full range because it was windy. I just focused on my game and in the end I was a little luckier."" A tally of 21 took his total number of aces to 67 in three matches and Karlovic also showed his all-court game with 49 winners against the Serbian star. Djokovic, who had to pull out of the final of the Abu Dhabi exhibition tournament last weekend due to a fever, had shown little ill-effects in beating Dusan Lajovic and Sergiy Stakhovsky for the loss of only six games in earlier matches. But he but could not find a way past Karlovic, who has now beaten him twice in their three career meetings. Karlovic, who gained the crucial break of service in the deciding set, hit the 9,000 aces milestone on the ATP Tour on Monday and will next face Spain's David Ferrer for a place in the final. Djokovic's exit completed a sorry week for the big name attractions in the Qatari capital, with defending champion Rafael Nadal going out in straight sets to German qualifier Michael Berrer in his opener. It was Nadal's first official match of his latest comeback after being hit by injury and illness at the back end of 2014. Meanwhile, world number two Roger Federer was also made to struggle against Australian John Millman at the Brisbane International event earlier in the day. Federer lost the first set of the second round match before rallying to a 4-6 6-4 6-3 victory.","Novak Djokovic beaten in quarterfinals of Qatar Open in Doha .

"Etihad Airways obviously had a clear agenda when redesigning the cabins on its Airbus A380 and Boeing 787 Dreamliner passenger jets -- come up with a product so outlandishly luxurious that the world's jet setters are left with no question as to who's leading the inflight glitz game. Case in point: on Etihad, travelers will soon be able to fly commercially in their own private residence with access to a Savoy Academy-trained butler, gourmet chef and concierge. Unveiled at a weekend launch to introduce Etihad's redesigned/renamed A380 and B787 cabins, ""The Residence by Etihad"" -- available only on the airline's A380 jets -- is a three-room VIP suite with its own living room, double bedroom and ensuite shower. Etihad says the space will sit in the upper-deck cabin and be available for single or double occupancy. One rung down on the luxury ladder, the upper deck of the new A380s -- the first of which is due for delivery in December -- will also offer nine new First Apartments, which are private suites with a separate reclining lounge seat and full-length bed. Each ""apartment"" will have its own 64-inch sliding door, minibar, personal vanity unit, wardrobe and swiveling TV monitor for viewing from either the seat or the bed. On the airline's new Dreamliners, the first of which is due for delivery in October, Etihad will offer First Suites, each with a large seat and ottoman, which converts into an 80.5 inch-long bed. On center seats, armrests retract and the suites can be joined to create a ""double"" bed. Other features include a minibar and a 24-inch TV monitor. Service at 'highest level yet in commercial aviation' On both the A380 and the B787, Etihad Airways will offer new Business Studios, which it says provide 20% more personal space than its current business-class seat. All seats have aisle access and convert into a fully flat 80.5-inch bed. Special prayer areas for Muslim passengers will be offered on both aircraft. Etihad says prayer areas can be curtained off for privacy and are equipped with a real-time electronic Qibla-finder showing the exact direction of Mecca based on the aircraft's geographical position. On the Airbus A380, all first- and business-class passengers will have access to The Lobby, a serviced lounge located between the two classes of cabins. With the launch of these new aircraft, Etihad Airways says it will update dining equipment, amenities and soft furnishings across its entire fleet. No word yet on how much tickets will cost. ""These new living spaces will raise inflight product and service standards to their highest level yet in commercial aviation and alter air travelers' expectations of inflight comfort and luxury forever,"" said James Hogan, Etihad Airways' president and CEO, in a statement. The cabins are the work of the Etihad Design Consortium, which is made up of three design companies -- Acumen, Factorydesign and Honour Branding. Etihad says it held consumer research and workshops in Abu Dhabi, Sydney, London and New York to determine what makes a ""perfect flight"" and asked consumers for their feedback, which was used to design the new products.

"A memorial cross at the National September 11 Memorial and Museum in New York can remain at the newly-opened facility, an appeals court ruled Monday. A three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit found that the cross, located at ground zero, was ""a symbol of hope"" and historical in nature. It did not intentionally discriminate against a group of atheists who sued to have it removed, they ruled. Cross moved to Trade Center site . The court also rejected arguments the traditional Christian cross was an impermissible mingling of church and state. ""With this recognition, a reasonable observer would view the primary effect of displaying the cross at ground zero, amid hundreds of other (mostly secular) artifacts, to be ensuring historical completeness, not promoting religion,"" the judges said in their decision. The 17-foot cross in the museum was erected by rescue and recovery workers, and built from intersecting steel beams that had been part of the World Trade Center's North Tower, after it collapsed during the al Qaeda terror attacks in 2001. 9/11 Museum . It was moved a year ago from near a church to its new location in lower Manhattan. ""This is an enormously important and common-sense ruling,"" said Eric Baxter, counsel for the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which filed a brief supporting the museum's right to display the cross, noting that the court drew an ""important distinction"" between religion and history and culture.

"No one used the word reward, but the subtext was clear for all to see. In April 2007, when Poland and Ukraine were surprisingly awarded the right to co-host the 2012 European Championship -- one of international football's top tournaments after the World Cup -- both countries' delegations exploded with joy. For the Ukrainians it was especially poignant. At the center of the celebrations was President Viktor Yushchenko, who had come to power leading the 2004 Orange Revolution, ignited when the election battle between him and the then Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych was allegedly riddled with fraud. Massive street protests swept away the old regime, whose last desperate attempt to cling on to power, according to supporters of Yushchenko, was a plot to poison the challenger. Yushchenko barely survived. But survive he did, and the chance to host Euro 2012 was redemption. Ukraine was finally, post communism, moving towards democracy and the rule of law. Euro 2012 represented a chance, as the Olympics did in Seoul and Tokyo decades before, for sport to welcome Ukraine into the club of free nations. ""We will be able to show millions of fans the unforgettable charm of our cities and the history they have preserved so beautifully,"" Yushchenko said when Ukraine's joint bid was selected to host the tournament. ""And put on display of Slav hospitality and culture."" A coronation . The final in Kiev on July 1, 2012, was to be the coronation. But with a month to go until Ukraine was to enjoy its moment in the sun, Yushchenko's words ring hollow. He was voted out of power in 2010, his Orange Revolution unraveling as, according to his supporters, the new president Yanukovych -- ironically the man he defeated in 2004 -- tries to roll back the gains made eight years ago. And far from highlighting Ukraine's development, Euro 2012 has done the opposite. Instead European statesmen and women are boycotting the event as the blond heroine of the Orange Revolution, former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, languishes in a prison cell thanks to what her supporters claim are spurious political charges. Last week her family released pictures of what they say is proof that Tymoshenko was beaten up in prison, which the Ukrainian government denies. ""Her condition is worsening, her physical condition,"" her daughter Eugenia Tymoshenko told CNN. ""That was after eight days of hunger strike. She was already much weaker because of the attacks when they beat her on April 20. Because of her protest her morale is very strong (but) we have asked her to stop her hunger strike."" Tymoshenko has been in prison since October last year. She received a seven-year sentence for abuse of power over the signing of a gas deal with Russia that the current president deemed detrimental to the national interest. But few outside of Ukraine saw it as anything other than the persecution of a political rival. ""Once she was arrested, there was a whole machine that started working,"" said Eugenia. ""They wanted to keep her in jail as her popularity was growing. She is now more popular. It is mostly fear that moved him and his people to keep her there until the (parliamentary) elections in October this year."" ""It's just political repression and they have moved to physical destruction. That has become critical. My mother is now on hunger strike because other political prisoners are suffering in jail with no medical help."" Political controversy . The pictures of Tymoshenko, baring her bruises to the camera, have created a firestorm in Europe's corridors of power. When it emerged that Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel was considering a boycott of the event to protest Tymoshenko's treatment, other EU leaders followed suit. EU president Herman Van Rompuy has said he won't attend -- as has Jose Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission, who less than 12 months ago had met with President Yanukovych and was presented with an official Euro 2012 match ball. The governments of Austria and Belgium have all said they will not be attending. Poland's opposition, who were in power when the Euros were awarded, has called for Ukraine's matches to be moved to Warsaw. The British and German governments are re-evaluating their positions. Even some of the players have spoken out. Germany captain Philipp Lahm told newspaper Der Spiegel that he did not find his ""views of democratic fundamental rights, human rights, personal freedom or press freedom to be reflected in the present political situation in Ukraine."" While Russian premier Vladimir Putin has criticized the boycotts -- stating that ""you can't mix politics, business and other issues with sport"" -- and the Ukrainian foreign ministry has condemned the outcry for causing ""damage to the interests of millions of ordinary Ukrainians that vote for various political parties or are not interested in politics at all,"" others point the finger of blame for the crisis at the Ukrainian government. ""There has been progress in many ways and the last round of elections that elected Yanukovych was largely free and fair,"" admitted Hugh Williamson, Europe and Central Asia director of Human Rights Watch. ""But we have particular concerns about what Yanukovych has done in prosecuting his political opponents. Few (Ukrainian government figures) have spoken out about her (Tymoshenko's) mistreatment and there's clear evidence that the charges against her are politically motivated."" Should fans boycott? While Human Rights Watch stops short of calling for a fan boycott of the tournament, it does support moves by political leaders to make a stand. ""Should politicians watch matches? We think they should speak out clearly. If they decide to not see a match ... we welcome that that is a clear signal,"" Williamson said. ""One could see a more extreme case with China and the (2008) Olympics. There's a clear risk that by allowing such countries to host such sporting contests, it legitimizes their actions."" Yet the scandal has highlighted a much more fundamental tension at the heart of Ukrainian society: whether, as those that led the Orange Revolution contest, Ukraine's future lays westwards, towards the EU; or whether its future is in the east and with Russia, the direction in which the current president is moving. ""The story of the European Championships was supposed to be bridge building between the two different Europes, cooperation across borders between east and west,"" argued Dr. Andrew Wilson, an expert in Ukrainian politics at Britain's University College London. ""But no, the story now is the good performance of Poland. Their success is in stark contrast with the problems in Ukraine."" He also suggested that the criticism that has followed the Tymoshenko case could push many Ukrainians away from EU integration, and towards the Kremlin's sphere of influence. ""Yes the boycott will have an effect,"" Wilson said. ""Prestige matters to this guy Yanukovych. They hoped the Euros would give them prestige. The argument that Ukrainians will turn to Russia is one made by Ukrainians. They say: 'Criticize us after we've made it, not before.' "" Not everyone is sympathetic to Tymoshenko's plight in Ukraine. President Yanukovych has repeatedly said that there was a criminal case to answer for. ""If Tymoshenko were looking for a compromise she would tell the truth to the Ukrainian people about why she broke the law,"" he told British newspaper The Times in a bellicose interview last year. Orange fatigue . And others point to Tymoshenko's poor political performance while prime minister for the lack of sympathy she has received in Ukraine. ""The Orange Revolution was a huge disappointment,"" explained Wilson. ""Media improved, civil society is stronger, but the Orange leaders fought like rats in a sack, especially Tymoshenko and former President Yushchenko. After five years of infighting, there was Orange fatigue."" Others in Ukraine point to the the failure of arguably the most infamous sporting boycott in history: the decision by the U.S. to snub the 1980 Moscow Olympics in protest at the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan. The Soviets returned the favor four years after for the 1984 Los Angeles Games. ""The experience of boycotting the Olympic Games of 1980 in Moscow by the West and the counter strike (by the) Socialist camp of the Games in Los Angeles did not influence political events too much but spoiled the careers of some great athletes,"" says Oleg Zadernovsky, a Ukrainian sports journalist who writes for World Soccer magazine. ""The whole country expects something similar to a game of football with two halves. ""At first Ukrainians would like to host with honor and dignity the biggest ever sporting event on its territory, while the second half will start in October this year when many of them will go to the ballot boxes to support opposition parties who promise to free Yulia Tymoshenko."" Yet for all the pressure, the tournament is unlikely to be moved. In a statement, the head of Ukraine's Euro 2012 organizing committee Markiyan Lubkivskyi admitted that while ""there are certain appeals by European politicians to UEFA"" over the issue of Tymoshenko as well as a myriad of other security concerns, ""the issue of moving the tournament (to Poland) was not considered even theoretically. It is impossible from a technical point of view or otherwise."" But as the political row rages, Tymoshenko remains in jail on hunger strike as Ukraine's reputation crumbles. What once seemed like a reward now looks like a curse. Eugenia Tymoshenko believes that the blame rests with one man. ""The political boycott is the result of the government and the actions of President Yanukovych that are against European standards that the EU wants to see,"" she said. ""The previous government had given (Ukraine) this wondrous opportunity for this celebration of sport with the European Championships. ""And I think European leaders do not want to be see (the president) use this politically, using repression and torture against political opponents.""","As Euro 2012 approaches, co-hosts Ukraine under fire over jailing of ex-PM .

"The 20th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards were full of fun and glowing moments. Here are some of the best from the show: . 1. Rita Moreno sings! The famed actress -- one of a handful of people to have won what's called the ""EGOT"" (Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, Tony) -- accepted the Life Achievement Award at the SAG Awards with all aspects of her forceful personality. She started with a curse, joked with presenter (and old ""Electric Company"" friend) Morgan Freeman and concluded with a touching rendition of ""This Is All I Ask."" Now 82, and more than 50 years removed from her ""West Side Story"" Oscar, she promised that she's ""early in the third act of my life."" Relive all the action with our live blog . 2. Bryan Cranston sings! Well, not much. But following Moreno, the ""Breaking Bad"" actor -- who won for lead actor in a TV drama -- launched into an impromptu rendition of ""I Won a SAG Award."" Then he turned modest, noting with some surprise how impressed he was when Emma Thompson came up to him. ""I lost it,"" he said. ""I've had so many crappy jobs in my life ... and the only thing that got me through was dreaming, one day, I could actually make a living as an actor."" SAG Awards winners list . 3. Lupita Nyong'o's acceptance. Nyong'o, who won a supporting actress award for her performance in ""12 Years a Slave,"" was positively giddy. ""I'm ... "" she giggled at one point, and had to take a breath and start the sentence again. She thanked Solomon Northup, who wrote the slave narrative on which the film was based, and director Steve McQueen, ""for taking a flashlight and shining it underneath the floorboards of this nation and reminding us what it is we stand on."" She said when she told her father she'd gotten in a movie with Brad Pitt, he responded that he didn't ""know him personally, but I'm glad you got a job."" She was glad, too. 2014 Oscar nominations announced . 4. Sofia Vergara's assets. The ""Modern Family"" star was directed to accept because ""America loves her and her boobs.""

"When radical Islamist fighters stormed the northern Iraqi town of Sinjar over the weekend, the Yazidi minority who call it home fled into the surrounding mountains in fear of their lives. Now, trapped without food, water or medical care in the summer heat, thousands of families are in desperate need of help. It's already too late to save dozens of children who've died of thirst. They are the latest victims of the brutal advance by the Islamic State, formerly the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, whose Sunni Muslim fighters have been targeting Iraq's Christians and other minority groups, as well as Shiite Muslims. Lawmaker Vian Dakhil, the only MP representing the Yazidi minority group in Iraq's Parliament, said in an impassioned speech that 70 Yazidi children had died so far, that women were being killed or sold into slavery and that 500 men had been ""slaughtered."" Tearfully appealing to lawmakers for help, she warned that the Islamic State was trying to wipe her community out. ""There is a collective attempt to exterminate the Yazidi people,"" she said. ""Similar to the fate of every other Iraqi, my people are being killed. The Shiites, Sunnis, Christians, Turkmen, Shabak people have been killed -- and now the Yazidi people are being killed."" Yazidis, among Iraq's smallest minorities, are of Kurdish descent, and their religion is considered a pre-Islamic sect that draws from Christianity, Judaism and Zoroastrianism. One of the oldest religious communities in the world, they have long suffered persecution, with many Muslims referring to them as devil-worshippers. 'Come to our rescue' Dakhil is not alone in highlighting the desperate plight of the sect, most of whose 500,000 or so members live in and around Sinjar in northwestern Nineveh province, bordering Iraq's Kurdish region. The U.N. children's agency, UNICEF, said Tuesday that official reports indicated 40 children from the Yazidi minority had died ""as a direct consequence of violence, displacement and dehydration"" since the weekend. ""Families who fled the area are in immediate need of urgent assistance, including up to 25,000 children who are now stranded in mountains surrounding Sinjar and are in dire need of humanitarian aid including drinking water and sanitation services,"" it said. Dakhil gave a similarly awful account. ""Over the course of 48 hours, 30,000 families are stranded in the Sinjar Mountains with no water and food. They are dying -- 70 kids so far died from thirst and suffocation,"" she said. ""Fifty old men died due to the deteriorating situation. Our women are being captured and sold as slaves."" As Dakhil, an MP for the Kurdistan Alliance list of Nineveh, Sinjar and Chenkal and chairman of a parliamentary committee for construction, addressed the Speaker, fellow lawmakers could be seen standing silently in solidarity. ""Brothers, let's put our political differences aside and work together as human beings,"" she pleaded. ""In the name of humanity, come to our rescue, come to our rescue."" Reports of killings, abductions . Rights group Amnesty International said Tuesday that fighters from the Islamic State continue to surround the mountain area where the Yazidis and other Iraqis who fled the Sinjar area are hiding. Kurdish fighters battled the militants on Monday in an attempt to retake Sinjar, a Kurdish commander said, and have been engaged in house-to-house combat in some of the fiercest fighting since the fall of Iraq's second city, Mosul, to the Islamic militant group in June. Hundreds of missing civilians, mainly men but also women and children, are reported to have been killed or captured, Amnesty International said. One relative told the group that the fighters had abducted or killed more than 30 members of two families from the village of Khana Sor, north-west of Sinjar close to the Syrian border. ""We urge the international community to provide humanitarian assistance, while the Iraqi and Kurdish authorities must spare no effort to ensure that much-needed aid is delivered to the displaced civilians and that they are protected from further ISIS attacks on the ground,"" said Donatella Rovera, Amnesty International's senior crisis response adviser, who is currently in northern Iraq. The U.S. State Department said Sunday that it was ""actively monitoring the situation"" in Sinjar, as well as the city of Tal Afar to the east, and that the United States is supporting both Iraqi security forces and Kurdish Peshmerga forces in the fight against the Islamic State. Spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the militants' assault, ""focusing on towns and villages populated by vulnerable minorities, demonstrates once again that this terrorist organization is a dire threat to all Iraqis, the entire region and the international community.""

"How could a commercial airliner disappear without a sign, you ask? In fact, several people on the ground or at sea claimed they saw Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 before it went missing after its post-midnight takeoff from Kuala Lumpur on March 8. The purported eyewitnesses include fishermen, an oil rig worker and islanders in an atoll. Some even alleged they saw it crash. While none of their claims have been substantiated, their assertions add to the ongoing mystery of the missing Boeing 777 and the 239 people aboard. Sighting claim: Kota Bharu, Malaysia . In the middle of the night, two fishermen near the Malaysia-Thailand border saw a plane flying low over the South China Sea -- at the same time that air traffic controllers lost contact with Flight 370 over the same body of water, at 1:30 a.m. or almost 50 minutes after takeoff. Fisherman Azid Ibrahim and a friend had taken people fishing that night off the coast of Kota Bharu. ""I was fishing when I saw the plane -- it looked strange. Flying low. I told my friend that's not normal. Normally, it flies at 35,000 feet. But that night it touched the clouds.  I thought the pilot must be crazy,"" Ibrahim said. ""It was really low. I saw the lights they looked like the size of a coconut,"" he said. Their fishing grounds lay under a flight path, but the predawn plane was unusual to see because of its low altitude, they said. The fishermen filed a police report about their sighting, but Malaysian officials haven't commented. Location, weather may hamper search . Sighting claim: Oil rig off Vietnam . A New Zealand man working on an oil rig off Vietnam claimed he saw a burning object in the sky Saturday morning, hours after the plane had taken off. Mike McKay of New Zealand was stationed on the Sona-Mercur oil rig on seas about 186 miles southeast of Vung Tau, a coastal Vietnamese town outside Ho Chi Minh City, according to CNN affiliate Radio New Zealand. McKay wrote of his sighting in an e-mail, the news outlet said. ""Gentlemen. I believe I saw the Malaysian Airlines flight come down. The timing is right. I tried to contact Malaysian and Vietnamese officials several days ago. But I do not know if the message has been received,"" he wrote last week. ""I observed the plane burning at high altitude at a compass bearing of 265 to 275 degrees from our surface location. ""While I observed (the plane) it appeared to be in one piece. From when I first saw the burning (plane?) until the flames went out (at high altitude) was 10-15 seconds. There was no lateral movement so it was either coming toward our position stationary (falling) or going away from our location. The general position of the observation was perpendicular/south-west of the normal flight path and at a lower altitude than the normal flight paths,"" he wrote. In fact, Vietnamese authorities dispatched aircraft last week to search for the plane, in response to McKay's report, the affiliate reported. When the Vietnamese navy sent a plane to conduct a search, it found nothing, ABC News reported. Vietnamese naval officer Le Minh Thanh told that network that the plane investigated the area cited by McKay, but the search came up empty. New theories about what happened to missing flight . Sighting claim: Maldives atoll . On a remote island in the Maldives, residents claimed they saw a ""low flying jumbo jet"" the same morning that the Malaysia plane disappeared, according to the website of the Maldivian news outlet Haveeru. Residents on the isle of Kuda Huvadhoo in the Dhaalu Atoll gave a description that matched the commercial airliners: white with red stripes, according to the news outlet. ""I've never seen a jet flying so low over our island before. We've seen seaplanes, but I'm sure that this was not one of those. I could even make out the doors on the plane clearly,"" an unidentified eyewitness said, according to Haveeru. ""It's not just me either, several other residents have reported seeing the exact same thing. Some people got out of their houses to see what was causing the tremendous noise too."" These claims, published in a story Tuesday, were dismissed by Malaysian officials. The Maldives coast guard told CNN it had no reports of such sightings and had not even been requested to conduct a search. The acting Malaysian transport minister also declared the reports false. ""I can confirm that the Malaysian Chief of the Defense Force has contacted his counterpart in the Maldives, who has confirmed that these reports are not true,"" Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said at a press conference. The Maldives Ministry of Defense and National Security also confirmed that their radar systems and surveillance mechanisms show no indication of the missing plane. Sighting claim: Off Indonesia coast . Indonesian fishermen claim they saw an airplane crash around the Strait of Malacca on the morning of March 9 -- more than a full day after the Malaysian plane took off -- the Indonesian state news agency Antara reported late Monday. The strait lies between Indonesia and Malaysia. The Indonesia fishermen, based in the North Sumatra provincial subdistrict of Pangkalan Susu, went to sea for a week of fishing on March 9, a Sunday. At 11 a.m., they saw a plane crash, Antara reported. ""We saw an airplane crash around the Malacca Straits,"" a fisherman identified as Hendra said, according to Antara. The fishermen saw a white plane crossing and circling, Antara reported. Smoke came from the plane's right rear portion when it circled for a second round and tilted to the left, the agency said. Flying lower, the plane then fell from sight. ""We suspect the plane crashed into the sea,"" Hendra said, according to Antara. ""We could not go to the location where the aircraft was lost due to large waves, and the boat did not have enough fuel."" The aircraft is believed to have crashed in waters off the Aceh provincial district of East Aceh. But there are two problems with these fishermen's account. They spotted the plane more than 24 hours after it took off from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. And Indonesian military officials said their radar didn't spot Flight 370. The Jakarta Post reported that Indonesian air force spokesman Air Commodore Hadi Tjahjanto said the Air Force's radar in Lhokseumawe, Aceh, didn't detect the missing flight in the area that the Malaysian military suggested was the plane's last detected position, around Penang waters. ""Our radar information has been shared with our Malaysian counterparts,"" the air force spokesman added, according to the Jakarta Post.

"(CNN)Introducing the Latina Meryl Streep, Act I. When she was growing up in Chicago, that's what Gina Rodriguez wanted to be. At the time, as the daughter of Puerto Rican migrants, that dream must have seemed unattainable. Now, not so much. For the last several months, the NYU graduate has been winning praise for her acting chops. And Sunday, she became only the second Latina to ever win a Golden Globe award for best actress, for her role in the television show ""Jane the Virgin,"" which airs on the CW network. The first was America Ferrera, who in 2007 took home a Golden Globe for her role in the television show ""Ugly Betty."" Among the performers in the audience cheering on Rodriguez's win Sunday night: Meryl Streep. What turns this from a good story into a great one is that Rodriguez -- recently dubbed the entertainment industry's ""Next Big Thing"" by The Hollywood Reporter -- is more than just a talented actress. We've seen those before. True, given Hollywood's antiquated predilection toward telling stories in black and white -- to the exclusion of Hispanics, Asians and others who don't fit into that narrow color scheme -- not enough of the talented Latina actresses who came before got the recognition they deserved or roles that reflected reality. But they were there, on screen and on film. Many Latinos have had Rodriguez on their radar for the last several months. It's all because of a series of thoughtful and provocative interviews that she has given about her priorities, world view and career choices. Read the interviews and you'll see: What makes Rodriguez special is not that she can play a character, but that she has character. They don't teach that sort of thing in acting school. You get it from your parents. And, in this case, Rodriguez obviously got it from hers -- Genaro and Magali. In July, on a panel during the Television Critics Association summer press tour in Beverly Hills, Rodriguez discussed why she had turned down a role in Lifetime's ""Devious Maids"" where Latinas are cast as -- oh, the suspense -- housekeepers. She explained: ""I found it limiting for the stories that Latinos have. For the stories that Americans have, I feel like there's a perception that people have about Latinos in America specifically -- somebody growing up in Chicago, English being my first language, Spanish being my second -- that we are perceived a very certain way. Our stories have been told, and they're not unmoralistic -- you know, being a maid is fantastic. You know, I have many family members that have fed many of their families on doing that job, but there are other stories that need to be told. And I think that the media is a venue and an avenue to educate and teach our next generation."" She turned down a steady paycheck, with no guarantee that something else would come along. ""I didn't become an artist to be a millionaire,"" she told the gathering. ""I didn't become an actor to wear Louis Vuitton. I have to give this dress back when we're done. I became an actor to change the way I grew up. The way I grew up, I never saw myself on screen. I have two older sisters. One's an investment banker. The other one is a doctor, and I never saw us being played as investment bankers. And I realized how limiting that was for me. I would look at the screen and think, 'Well, there's no way I can do it, because I'm not there.' And it's like as soon as you follow your dreams, you give other people the allowance to follow theirs."" When ""Jane the Virgin"" came along, Rodriguez thought the show -- which is loosely adapted from a Venezuelan telenovela -- was the ""most authentic, genuine representation"" of a Latino family that she had ever seen on television, she told The New York Times. It has the alluring spice of cultural references, but not to the point where it overpowers the palate. ""For once, I was reading a script where they weren't talking about my ethnicity,"" she told the Times. ""They weren't putting a Puerto Rican flag on my shoulder. They weren't putting a taco in my hand."" In an industry full of people who are known for being shallow, self-centered and afraid to make waves, Rodriguez is none of those things. She is smart, brave and eager to challenge those in power to confront their prejudices and blind spots. Oddly enough, these are the kinds of things that are supposed to get you in trouble in Hollywood, where people think of themselves as liberal and don't much appreciate those who tell them otherwise. Remember the Sony hack story, and how flustered the liberal studio executives, writers, producers and actors became when it was revealed that some of what they say in private isn't very progressive? But Rodriguez isn't in trouble. Instead, she's on the fast track to stardom. And, best of all, she seems intent on taking her community along for the ride.","Gina Rodriguez says her show, ""Jane the Virgin,"" gives an authentic picture of a Latino family .

"(CNN)In 2014, beheading a westerner proved to be a chillingly effective strategy for Islamic militants. The killings of James Foley, Steven Sotloff, David Haines, Alan Henning and Abdul-Rahman Peter Kassig were both barbaric and uniquely modern. The murderers acted with a key demographic in mind, knowing that millions of people would tune in to watch. So the camera has created a new kind of crowd in the course of our long history of public beheadings. Its entrance on the scene, in France, on 17 June 1939, had a similarly immediate and unequivocal effect. That morning, the public guillotining of German serial killer Eugen Weidmann, outside the Saint-Pierre prison in Versailles, was filmed by a spectator -- unbeknownst to the authorities. You can see the footage online today. Photographers also recorded the action, and their pictures filled newspapers and magazines in the days after Weidmann's death. As if the rowdy crowds on the day were not bad enough, now the action could be viewed again and again by untold thousands of voyeurs. After that, the guillotine was rolled away behind prison walls -- not because decapitations were too horrifying to watch, but because people will watch them no matter how horrifying they are. For centuries, public executions had been intended to terrify by example, when for many they were little more than light entertainment. The advent of film proved this beyond doubt.If the history of beheadings tells us anything, it is that there will always be people who want to see. Today the Internet offers us front-row seats, on the understanding that no one need know we have taken our places to watch. Murders can be ""nothing to do with us"" even as we click on the screen to play the film. In the 21st century, spectators experience a sense of detachment from the event -- which has already happened at some point in the past and in ""another world"" supposedly far removed from our own -- alongside an unprecedented sense of intimacy. Now we can watch close-up, but in private, in our own time and space. The recent ISIS beheadings were experienced by many viewers like a gruesome serial drama, and the murderers know we will tune in for the next episode. Even those who do not watch the ISIS ""show"" can hardly avoid the media analysis that accompanies each instalment. Producing these films requires relatively little organization, money or complicated technology. Compared to other terrorist offenses, it is low-tech and high-impact. The action can be carefully choreographed while retaining its ruthless authenticity, and the results are sensational. The camera has become a new stage for public beheadings, a new spike for displaying a trophy head. When pathological criminals behead innocent civilians, the murderers address their audience and present their spoils, drawing those who watch into their narrative. The entire spectacle denotes the powerlessness of the victim, and, by extension, the powerlessness of their countrymen to intervene. Spectators who watch beheadings online impotently fulfil the perpetrators' desire to be seen. The ISIS murderers have relied on sophisticated manipulation of social media sites to ensure that their footage appears on our screens before we even know what we are watching. At the same time, a person's reaction can reverberate through the cyber-crowd instantaneously, creating the kind of group mentality that mirrors the dynamics of a real crowd. When the footage of James Foley's murder circulated via social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook in August 2014, a Syrian activist named Hend Amry asked people not to share it and initiated the hashtag #ISISmediablackout. ""Pour water on their flame,"" she tweeted. The movement to boycott the film gathered momentum in the hours that followed, and Twitter responded by removing tweets that embedded the video or screenshots of it. For the first time since the death of Daniel Pearl in Pakistan in 2004, the silent majority found a voice, and more and more members of the crowd refused to watch. A group of militants had tried to make an impact, in an appalling way, and their efforts were beginning, just beginning, to fail. When the victim of a beheading is bound and defenceless, he or she becomes a pawn in somebody else's production. The power no longer derives from the act of decapitation itself, which may require a pathological perpetrator, but it does not require the luck and skill to win a fight. Instead, the power emerges from the reception the slayer receives as he plays his part on the stage. There is no triumph in the killer's actions until we watch. Modern technology may offer a hiding place to voyeurs, but it can also give a voice to human decency. No good can ever come from murder, but if public opinion is able to neutralize the killers' triumph by refusing to broadcast the graphic imagery they want us to see, then this is a step forward.

"Angry. Sad. Grieving. That's how family members of 62-year-old Carolyn Watkins described their feelings after her body was discovered in a car, days after it was towed from a crash. ""We were wondering where she was, and she was in the car the whole time,"" said Algernon Parker, 42, Watkins' son. ""Even if it was a dog, that would be bad, but you know, I mean, a human? Come on now. You don't even want to leave your dog in the car for 2 to 3 hours."" Watkins' body was found inside her wrecked car at a tow yard Monday, the same day family members said they reported her missing. Her car was taken to the yard Friday after a trooper discovered it in a ditch in Johnston County, North Carolina. In his report, the trooper noted that no one was in the vehicle. That report has since been called into question, and authorities said they are working to get to the bottom of the case. ""First and foremost, we offer our most sincere condolences to Carolyn Watkins' family,"" said Frank Perry, commissioner of the Department of Public Safety, Law Enforcement Division. ""At this early stage, our main concern is to conduct a thorough and professional investigation so we can determine exactly what happened."" At the request of the Johnston County district attorney, the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation is similarly looking into both the death and the actions of the trooper. Parker's wife, Patricia, 43, said the family did not initially report Watkins missing because they figured she had gone out of town for the Easter weekend. Watkins lived with her son and daughter-in-law in Clayton, also in Johnston County. But when she didn't show up or call her job Monday, they knew something was wrong. They filed a report, prompting detectives to go back to the car to search for clues. They found Watkins instead, slumped in the front seat. ""It was terrible she had to lay in that vehicle that long,"" Patricia Parker said. At first, family members were worried Watkins may have still been alive when she was taken to the tow yard, but medical officials have since told them that she likely died on impact. Watkins suffered blunt force injuries to the head and neck, according to her daughter-in-law. She blamed the trooper, who was placed on administrative duty with pay following the incident. Watkins had two children and four grandchildren. She loved to garden, cook and was described by both Parkers as someone who never met a stranger. ""I was angry, and now I'm just sad about it,"" said Algernon Parker. ""Tell your loved ones you love them, that's all. I didn't have a chance to do it.""","Authorities, including the State Bureau of Investigation, are investigating what happened .

"Los Angeles (CNN)Mitt Romney may have slowed some of Jeb Bush's momentum this week, but the former Florida governor is off to a fast start on the California fundraising circuit. And several events are being co-hosted by former financial backers of Romney, according to the invitations obtained by CNN. The two potential 2016 presidential candidates will both be in California this week. Romney, the former Massachusetts governor and 2012 Republican presidential nominee, will briefly address the Republican National Committee's winter meeting in San Diego on Friday night. Romney to speak at California RNC meeting . Bush has a full slate of fundraisers for both his Right to Rise leadership PAC and the Right to Rise super PAC, an independent committee that would be likely to support his presidential bid. Under campaign finance laws, super PACs may not coordinate with official campaign committees during a certain phase of the presidential campaign, but Bush has not formally announced an exploratory bid for the presidency or any official campaign committees. On Thursday in Los Angeles, the former Florida governor is the featured guest at a reception and discussion for his Right to Rise leadership PAC co-hosted by Brad Freeman, a close friend and top financial backer of his brother, President George W. Bush. Guests are asked for contributions of up to $5,000, the annual limit they may give to the leadership PAC in a calendar year. Bush will then head out to the desert for two Right to Rise super PAC fundraisers, followed by an evening reception to benefit the leadership PAC. The host committees for the events for the leadership PAC and the super PAC include many of the same people. Christie supporters to form leadership PAC . The Friday night reception and discussion will take place at the Eldorado Country Club in Indian Wells and will be limited to 100 guests, who were asked to contribute $1,250 per individual or $2,500 per couple to Bush's new Right to Rise PAC. The host committee includes hotelier Gordon Sondland, a real estate investor who was a member of Romney's national finance committee and major supporter of the super PAC that backed him in 2012. Another member of the host committee is former ambassador Charles J. Swindells, who was appointed as U.S. Ambassador to New Zealand and Samoa by President George W. Bush. Former Missouri Sen. John Danforth, who was considered as a vice presidential running mate for President Bush and later served as his special envoy to the Sudan and U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, will be on the honorary host committee for the evening Indian Wells fundraiser, as well as the earlier events to benefit the Bush-aligned super PAC. In 2011, Danforth endorsed Romney and joined him at a fundraising event in St. Louis, praising him as having shown the ""skill and leadership ability to ensure that the U.S. remains the strongest and most respected nation in the world."" Republicans will have to spin struggling state economies in 2016 . Other alumni from President Bush's administration on the honorary host committees for Friday's events include former U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Rockwell Schnabel; former U.S. Ambassador to Germany William ""Tim"" Timken and his wife, Sue; former U.S. Ambassador to Spain and former owner of the Seattle Mariners George Argyros (a longtime GOP fundraiser who helped Romney raise money in California during the 2012 cycle). The luncheon for the discussion with Bush to benefit his Right to Rise super PAC will be held at the home of Stacey and Greg Renker, a couple well-known for their philanthropy and contributions to the Eisenhower Medical Center in the Palm Springs area. Luncheon guests were asked to contribute $12,500 to the Bush-aligned super PAC. An afternoon roundtable with Bush at the home of Carol Price will also benefit the Right to Rise super PAC with donations from guests of $7,500.

"You feel happiness all the way down to your genes, scientists say. But the kind of happiness you're feeling matters, as different kinds can have wildly different effects on your physical well-being. In fact, the happiness you get from instant gratification -- eating that giant cupcake or buying that fabulous pair of shoes -- may have the same physical impact on your genes as depression or stress, according to a groundbreaking study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. ""I've been studying the physical and psychological impact of positive emotion for 20 years, (and) the pattern of results we found with this study completely surprised me,"" said the lead author, Barbara Fredrickson. Fredrickson is a professor of psychology and the principal investigator of the Positive Emotions and Psychophysiology Lab at the University of North Carolina. ""I've known anecdotally that positive emotions impact us on a cellular level, but seeing these results have given us proof that there is a real difference in the kinds of happiness we feel and its potential long-term consequences."" How shopping makes you happy . The experts divide well-being into two different types: hedonic and eudaimonic. These are fancy words to describe happiness that comes from two different sources. Hedonic well-being comes from an experience a person seeks out that gives them pleasure. As study co-author Steve Cole describes it, it's ""having lots of positive experiences that come from, say, eating great food or smelling beautiful flowers."" Eudaimonic well-being is a kind of happiness that comes not from consuming something but from a sustained effort at working toward something bigger than you. In other words, it's working toward a sense of meaning in your life or contributing to some kind of cause. Think of the happiness you see on the Dalai Lama or Mother Teresa's face. While the two kinds of happiness are conceptually different, they can and do influence each other, so it has been hard for scientists to measure which kind has had a greater positive influence on someone's physical or psychological well-being. 9 simple steps to happiness . Cole, a professor of medicine, psychiatry and biobehavioral sciences at UCLA, studies the biological pathways by which social environments influence gene expression. ""I know what misery looks like on a genetic level,"" Cole said. ""I can look at white blood cells and see a physical response to stress and misery, but we knew very little about how -- if at all -- positive psychology gets disseminated to the body. That's what this study does."" If you experience misery and stress, your genes react to it. Essentially, there is an increased expression of genes involved in inflammation and a decreased antiviral response. People who are subjected to long periods of stress have white blood cells that make slightly more pro-inflammatory proteins on a constant basis. Inflammation is the first line of defense against infection, so that would be a very useful kind of protein to have; however, something that causes your body to create inflammation over a sustained amount of time can cause collateral damage to healthy tissue. Colorado College microbiologist Phoebe Lostroh, who is not affiliated with the study but is familiar with its contents, explains it this way: ""The immune system of someone stressed out is not at the normal level of green on the terrorism alert scale. Instead, it's on yellow or orange, if not all the way on red. So there's this low level of constant inflammation, which is not healthy."" Use your money to buy happier time . Low levels of inflammation can cause exhaustion. They also increase a person's risk for cancer, heart disease and Alzheimer's and can damage various tissues wherever the white blood cells are causing inflammation where they shouldn't be, Lostroh said. With this understanding in mind, the scientists in the new study took blood from 80 healthy adults who were screened for the two types of happiness.  None of them reported being depressed or stressed. Scientists extracted the RNA from their blood and took a closer look at the inflammatory and antiviral responses. The study found that people who experienced the well-being that comes from self-gratification had high inflammation and low antiviral and antibody gene expression, a result similar to what people who are depressed or experience great stress have. Cheerfulness may hold back female leaders . The people who found happiness by pursuing a greater good had a lower level of this inflammatory gene expression and strong antiviral and antibody gene expression. Bottom line? Happiness that comes from working for the greater good has a much more positive genetic impact. ""Keep in mind positives go with both kinds of well-being,"" Fredrickson said.  ""But emotions you feel today ... really will effect who you are at a cellular level."" The study didn't get at why the two kinds of well-being have different genetic impacts, but Cole has a theory. ""Hedonic well-being is dependent on your taking self-involved action to constantly feed this positive emotion machine,"" he said. ""If something threatens your ability to seek out this kind of personal happiness -- if you get injured, for instance, or you experience a loss -- your entire source of well-being is threatened. You are living closer to the edge of that kind of stress. ""But if you find well-being in the connections you have to others and in pursuing something that involves collaborating with other people, if in that circumstance you get sick or injured or suffer a personal loss, that community you've worked so hard to connect to, they will help you get through.""","Hedonic well-being is a happiness from instant gratification .
Eudaimonic well-being is a happiness that comes from working toward greater good .

"A pregnant nurse tells CNN she was fired from her job after she refused to get a flu shot for fear of miscarrying. ""I'm a healthy person. I take care of my body. For me, the potential risk was not worth it,"" Dreonna Breton told CNN Sunday. ""I'm not gonna be the one percent of people that has a problem."" Breton, 29, worked as a nurse at Horizons Healthcare Services in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, when she was told that all employees were required to get a flu shot. The Centers of Disease Control and Prevention advises that all health care professionals get vaccinated annually. She told her employers that she would not get the vaccine after she explained that there were very limited studies of the effects on pregnant women. Breton came to the decision with her family after three miscarriages. CDC: More states reporting widespread flu . The mother of one submitted letters from her obstetrician and primary care doctor supporting her decision, but she was told that she would be fired on December 17 if she did not receive the vaccine before then. Horizons Healthcare Services spokesman Alan Peterson told CNN affiliate WPVI that it's unconscionable for a health care worker not to be immunized and that pregnant women are more susceptible to the flu. The CDC website states that getting a flu shot while pregnant is the best protection for pregnant women and their babies. ""I know that the CDC says to get it, and that's fine, but it was our choice to avoid the flu vaccine and the unknowns that come with that,"" Breton said. Breton offered to wear a face mask at work, a practice that is used if employees are exempted for religious reasons. The hospital did not approve, according to Breton. Breton has no interest in taking legal action, she said. She stated she only wants the company to reevaluate their policy on vaccines for pregnant employees and to continue working as a nurse.

"(CNN)After 15 years of being addicted to drugs, David Gordon was ready to turn his life around, but he soon realized there were others that were still being controlled by addiction. Having been through the cycle of jail and drugs, starting with marijuana and ending up with heroin, he decided to start his own rehabilitation center in Bogor, a city just south of Indonesia's capital Jakarta. Now, 18 years later, he is the director of the Yakita Foundation, one of the only non-governmental drug rehabilitation services in the country with locations across in Indonesia. Spreading drug problem . ""I saw an article about the only drug recovery center in the country at that time, at the government hospital,"" explains Gordon. ""I went over as a volunteer and saw the problem immediately. I sat with 22 young people, 21 were heroin addicts. ""I had never seen that many heroin addicts in one place at one time, and I'm an old junkie. That was the day that all of this began."" Gordon started the foundation in 1996, alongside his wife Joyce, who brought in her knowledge from working with non-governmental organizations (NGOs). In the mid-1990s it was difficult for drug addicts to get clean as there were few drug programs and help centers. ""In 1996 heroin was running wild. It had spread so quickly people did not recognize the severity of the problem,"" says Gordon. ""I thought the best way to begin was to start the narcotics anonymous program in Indonesia. It was already well established worldwide, but nothing was translated. So my wife Joyce translated the alcoholics anonymous book and the narcotics anonymous basic text."" Educational solutions . David and Joyce's first program lasted six months, they taught 156 modules over that period, teaching five hours a day and checking on the progress of each individual student. ""The offering was a complete program,"" says Gordon. ""We had programs that dealt with prevention, intervention, detoxification, and the beginnings of a basic aftercare program. We created a school with an above university level of education. ""It gave them a basic understanding that they had a choice. If you're going to relapse at the end of six months, choose it. Giving them the choice is what a real program will do."" Family support . However, the pair have come up against some problems, family support being one of them. ""Aftercare is a big problem across the country,"" says Gordon. The sense of shame prevents some families from being involved in the aftercare programs, which could make a huge difference. In addition, the drug problem in the country is growing faster than the foundation can possibly work. Despite this setback, the Yakita Foundation won't quit. ""I keep going for the same reason I started."" says Gordon. ""I remember a long time ago somebody put their hand out to me when I had no hope and showed me these programs. I started with a 12-step program and they gave without taking anything. ""That was a very long time ago now and I do it for the same reason. I see people who have no hope.""","Former addict and ex-convict David Gordon is taking on Indonesia's drug problem .

"(CNN)France's Muslims warn of a growing anti-Islam backlash as the country slowly comes to terms with last week's deadly attacks on Charlie Hebdo magazine and a Jewish supermarket. Groups representing French Muslims have urged authorities to step in to protect them in the same way as they have boosted security around Jewish sites. ""All Muslim organizations in France are concerned about the numerous anti-Muslim acts seen in the past few days and call on the authorities to be vigilant to ensure the security of mosques,"" said Dalil Boubakeur, rector of the Great Mosque of Paris and president of the French Council of the Muslim Faith. Prime Minister Manuel Valls told CNN's French affiliate BFMTV on Monday that a number of mosques had been attacked in recent days, with shots being fired in some cases. In other instances, religious buildings have been set on fire, a pig's head has been stuck to a prayer room door and messages of hate have been sprayed on walls, according to French media reports. Valls said the thousands of extra police and soldiers deployed to ensure national security since Wednesday's attack on Charlie Hebdo would watch over mosques as well as Jewish schools and synagogues. After attacks, 7 questions being asked about Islam . France is at war against terrorism, not Islam or Muslims, Valls told the French Parliament on Tuesday. France will protect all its citizens, with determination and calmness, he said. The Union of Islamic Organizations in France, or UOIF, urged the French authorities to take all the necessary steps to protect Muslims and mosques as it rejected any link with terrorists. The group said there have been more than 50 anti-Muslim incidents, including reports of shootings and threats. French Muslims are worried and hoping for a rapid return to calm, it said. Security has been increased at Muslim sites. ""Terrorism and crime have no religion,"" the group said in a statement. ""The UOIF absolutely refuses that Muslims and their places of worship should be implicated or targeted for terrorist excesses which are only down to their authors."" The three terrorists who carried out last week's attacks, killing 17 people in the course of three days of fear, have been linked to the Islamist extremist groups ISIS and al Qaeda. Two of them, brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi, who stormed the offices of Charlie Hebdo, said they were acting to avenge the Prophet Mohammed. The magazine has previously published controversial images of the prophet -- seen as blasphemy by Muslims -- and it's been revealed that the cover of the new edition to be published Wednesday, drawn by the attack survivors, will again feature a cartoon of Mohammed. With some 3 million copies set to be distributed, there's scope for an angry reaction from those who see it as deeply offensive. But in his statement, Boubakeur urged the Muslim community to ""remain calm"" and avoid an emotional reaction, ""all the while respecting the freedom of opinion."" Many French Muslims turned out in Paris and elsewhere for huge national unity marches Sunday, keen to show they shared in the nation's horror and grief at the events of last week. Some held placards saying ""Je suis juif,"" or I am Jewish,"" as a sign of solidarity with the four Jewish people killed in the supermarket attack, picking up on the widely embraced slogan, ""Je suis Charlie."" One young Muslim woman named Amina, who held a sign declaring both statements as she marched, told CNN that the killings were not down to religion. ""It is very important for me because, as you can see, Jews and Muslims shouldn't be enemies and they should refuse to be enemies,"" she said. As a Muslim, Amina said, she had cried when she learned that so many people had been killed. ""Here in France it is very, very, very difficult to live when you are Muslim because they always think you are a terrorist. And when I heard that again, Muslims killed people because they were not OK with what they said, I was totally ashamed and I was very sad,"" she said. One of the 12 victims in the Charlie Hebdo attack was police officer Ahmed Merabet, a French Muslim of Algerian descent. At a national ceremony in Paris, French President François Hollande eulogized him alongside two other slain officers, Franck Brinsolaro and Clarissa Jean-Philippe, awarding each the Legion d'Honneur (National Order of Merit.) Merabet's brother, Malek, told reporters that Ahmed had been proud of his name, proud to be a police officer and proud to defend the values of the French republic. ""He was killed by false Muslims,"" said Malek Merabet, warning of the dangers of a wider backlash against those who share his faith. ""I address myself now to all the racists, Islamophobes and anti-Semites,"" he said. ""One must not confuse extremists with Muslims. Mad people have neither color or religion. ""I want to make another point: Don't tar everybody with the same brush, don't burn mosques -- or synagogues. You are attacking people. It won't bring our dead back, and it won't appease the families."" Bergen: Does Islam fuel terrorism?

"(CNN)In a bid to put Middle Eastern countries on the map, its businesses are putting their names on football shirts. As the region's nations establish themselves as sporting powers, countries such as Qatar and the United Arab Emirates have pumped millions into sponsoring football clubs. A report published by Repucom states that in 2014 alone, brands from the UAE spent $163 million on shirt sponsorship deals. It's a level of spending matched by Qatar, with companies from the gulf kingdom investing an average of $49.1m on each shirt deal it makes with European football clubs. According to professor Simon Chadwick from the University of Coventry, Qatar's bid to establish global prominence through football is similar to the U.S. establishing itself within the technology industry. ""In the case of Qatar, its 2030 Industrial Vision has sport as a fundamental pillar of its strategic development as a nation,"" he told CNN. ""Just as the United States, through Silicon Valley, has positioned itself at the heart of the global IT industry, so sport is being used in the same way by emerging nations."" The Middle East has enjoyed a rapid rise within the world of football, aided by Qatar's successful bid to host the 2022 World Cup. Football has now become a booming business in the region, but investors are tending to hand money to European clubs, not their own. The Middle East has spent $1.5bn on acquiring stakes in European football clubs and billionaires from the region have purchased Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain, helping to transform the English and French champions into European powerhouses. Whilst these investments provide much needed financial stability for these clubs, they are also muscling out local sponsorship. It's becoming more and more likely that European clubs will be owned by wealthy foreigners rather than local companies who have been hit hard by the global financial crisis. Qatar and UAE weathered the economic downturn thanks to the oil industry, so are now set to lead expensive deals in the football world -- and not just for the love of the game.","Qatar and UAE's wealth make them big players in football .

"Planes, trains and automobiles -- all these modes of transportation were affected Saturday by Hurricane Sandy, even with the storm many hours away from making landfall. The storm is expected to cause massive flooding and widespread power outages when it hits the East Coast, in full, late Sunday and into next week. But before that happens, transportation companies and government officials are allowing -- and, in some cases, urging -- people to plan for the worst. A number of airlines, for example, are allowing customers to change their flight plans without paying any fees due to Sandy. Delta will let those ticketed to fly between Sunday and Wednesday, in and out of airports in 15 states and the District of Columbia, to reschedule by November 4. United's offer applies to travel to-and-from 29 airports, for the same dates. East Coast braces for 'superstorm' Other airlines, such as American, are offering a similar process, with slight variations. And at least in U.S. Airways' case, the weather is already keeping airlines busy: The airline apologized to customers on its Twitter feed for long waits to get through to agents due to a high call volume tied to Sandy. Amtrak announced Saturday that it will cancel some of its train runs on Sunday to and from Richmond and Newport News, Virginia; Chicago and Washington; Miami and New York; and Washington and New York. In addition, a train scheduled to run Monday between Washington and Chicago will also remain in the station. ""Passengers are encouraged to travel on earlier available trains on Sunday,"" Amtrak said in a news release. ""Additional cancellations might be necessary in the coming days as this major storm moves north."" Even New York's vaunted, round-the-clock subway system could shut down due to flooding and other issues tied to the storm. Officials say they'll decide Sunday whether to suspend service on the subway, as well as on buses and commuter rail, depending on Sandy proceeds. For now, New Yorkers should plan their lives as if such a suspension will happen, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. ""New Yorkers need to take action now to protect themselves, and as the transportation system prepares to possibly suspend service, no one should wait until the last minute to prepare,"" said Cuomo, who has declared a state of emergency in the state. Meanwhile, New Jersey is taking steps to shut down NJ Transit bus, rail and Access Link service on Monday -- much as it did last year for 36 hours due to Hurricane Irene. ""By beginning this important process, NJ Transit will be better able to support the state's response to Hurricane Sandy by freeing up buses or other resources that may be needed for hurricane relief,"" Department of Transportation Commissioner James Simpson said in a press release. For all the potential headaches at airports, train stations and bus terminals, the type of transportation affected first and most directly by Sandy may be boating. All along the East Coast, meteorologists and officials have warned people to steer clear of the seas because of potentially perilous high winds and large waves tied to the storm. Pam and Bob Haigh, a Rhode Island couple, were surprised -- given how late it is in the hurricane season -- that Sandy has delayed their plans to sail from Maryland to the Florida Keys. But they know that this isn't the first time that Mother Nature has affected travel plans -- nor will it be the last. ""We've got a surprise, so we'll just ride it out,"" Pam Haigh said.

"Citing a lack of evidence, Afghan authorities released from prison 65 men Thursday over strong objections from U.S. officials, who said they pose a threat to security forces and civilians. ""We took this decision according to our law,"" said Mohammad Ishaq Aloko, the Afghan attorney general. In a statement posted on its website, the U.S. Embassy in Kabul called the move ""deeply regrettable,"" saying the Afghan government ""bears responsibility for the results of its decision."" Abdul Shukor Dadras, head of the Afghan Review Board, said the attorney general ordered the releases from the Parwan Detention Center -- formerly known as Bagram prison -- after a careful review of 88 cases. The U.S. military in Afghanistan said some of the men are linked to attacks that killed or wounded 32 American or coalition service members and 23 Afghan security personnel or civilians. But a 23-page document obtained by CNN Pentagon Correspondent Barbara Starr from a U.S. military official who asked not to be identified said about 19 of the released men were associated with direct attacks that killed or wounded 60 U.S. or coalition force members. There was no immediate explanation for the discrepancy. According to the document, 25 of the men were linked to the production or placement of IEDs; 33 tested positive for explosive residue when processed after capture; and 26 were associated with attacks that killed or wounded 57 Afghan citizens and Afghan National Security Forces. Prior to the prisoners' release, U.S. authorities had repeatedly aired their displeasure over the plans. ""We have made clear our judgment that these individuals should be prosecuted under Afghan law. We requested that the cases be carefully reviewed,"" the U.S. military said ahead of the release. ""But the evidence against them was never seriously considered, including by the attorney general, given the short time since the decision was made to transfer these cases to the Afghan legal system."" Releasing them, the embassy said, ""is contrary to Afghanistan's commitment in our 2012 Memorandum of Understanding to take all necessary steps to ensure that detainees do not pose a continuing threat to Afghanistan, the international community or the United States."" NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said he was ""gravely concerned"" by the decision, ""which appears to have been made based on political calculations and without regard for due process before the Afghan courts."" In a statement, he called it ""a major step backwards for the rule of law in Afghanistan."" The U.S. military noted that the group included an alleged Taliban explosives expert, a suspected Haqqani network commander and a specialist accused of building and placing improvised explosive devices. ""These individuals are dangerous,"" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said Wednesday. ""They pose threats to the safety and security of the Afghan people and the Afghan state."" Afghan President Hamid Karzai defended the releases and slammed the United States for criticizing them. The decisions were made only after ""rigorous and repeated investigations and fact-finding,"" he told reporters in Ankara, where he met with representatives of Turkey and Pakistan. ""Afghanistan is a sovereign country,"" he said. ""If the Afghan authorities decide to release a prisoner, it is of no concern to the U.S. and should be of no concern to the U.S. And I hope that the United States would stop harassing Afghanistan's procedures and judicial authority and I hope that the United States will now begin to respect Afghan sovereignty."" Karzai also addressed the question of whether he will sign a bilateral security agreement (BSA) with Washington that would allow for U.S. and other coalition forces to remain in Afghanistan after this year. ""There must be first the launch of the peace process before the BSA is signed,"" he said. ""Now this condition is not an opposition to BSA; it is a facilitator of the BSA. I put this condition not to oppose the signing of BSA but to promote, facilitate the signing of the BSA with the United States, and I hope that it should be understood in the same terms.""","""It is of no concern to the U.S.,"" says Afghan president about the prisoner release .

"While about a quarter of adults in the United States suffer from some form of mental illness, most of them are not getting adequate treatment, if any. In the age when there's an app for everything, it's no surprise that there are a lot of smartphone tools out there claiming to help people cope. From informational resources to interactive mental wellness programs, there's plenty out there to choose from. And even if you don't have a diagnosed mental illness, you may benefit from recognizing the triggers of bad moods or creating ways to enhance positive thinking. Don't mistake your phone for a therapist, but some mental health professionals are encouraging their patients to use mobile apps as a way to supplement their care. ""You can definitely utilize and capitalize on the smartphone technology to create tools that people have with them all the time,"" said Kristen Mulcahy, a psychologist in Falmouth, Massachusetts. Mulcahy came up with the idea for an app for people with obsessive-compulsive disorder that is a fully comprehensive tool with versions for children and adults. Patients with OCD have unwanted thoughts and anxieties that trigger repetitive behaviors. The Live OCD Free app for iPad or iPhone makes use of a well-tested treatment for OCD called exposure and response prevention. The technique forces patients to face their fears head-on without engaging in compulsions. Users can practice this with, for instance, leaving the house without checking the door lock multiple times, over a given time period. If they give in before the timer is up, there's a ""Just Gave In"" button. The user can also create an audio recording of an obsessive thought to listen to on loop, in order to practice enduring it without doing a repetitive behavior. More than just a tool to use on your own, the app can help the user's therapist see progress over time by generating charts that can be e-mailed. ""It holds (patients) a lot more accountable, because they know I'm going to be able to see everything they are or aren't doing,"" she said. The price tag is steep at $79.99, but it may help patients cut back on their more expensive in-person sessions a lot faster, Mulcahy said; the app is a ""surrogate therapist."" Tracking your body with technology . For less than a dollar, there are a variety of tools available to address other aspects of mental health. Dr. Rakesh Jain, psychiatrist at the University of Texas Medical School at Houston, uses a free mood tracking app called Moody Me by MedHelp. Users can upload photos that correspond with different moods, from ""manic"" and ""excellent"" to ""horrible"" and ""depressed."" You can delve deeper into what's causing the mood by with a list of relevant emotions, symptoms and events. Users who are taking medications can also note them in their daily mood entries. The app also creates graphs of moods over time so users can detect patterns. Moody Me also has a social feature, where users can share their moods with their friends. There are ""Ask a Doctor"" forums with advice from real experts on a variety of topics and communities for discussions around specific mental disorders. Jain also gets his patients to use a body weight tracker called BMI by NutriSystem to track their body mass index, since depression is a mind-body disorder. Although BMI is an imperfect indicator of health, studies have shown that depression and BMI are linked. His favorite app is called Live Happy, which costs 99 cents. It was developed in collaboration with Sonja Lyubomirsky, a psychologist at the University of California, Riverside, and the company Signal Patterns. The app offers happiness-boosting activities wherever you go. For example, the ""Best Possible Self"" activity asks you to take 15 to 30 minutes in a quiet place and reflect on what your life will be like ideally in five years, including the life goals you want to accomplish. There's a ""Strive"" section where you can identify goals and characterize them, too. Part of this app is also expressing gratitude. You can call, text or e-mail a person whom you appreciate. A ""gratitude journal"" allows you to jot down things that you are thankful for in your life. The ""Replay Happy Days"" activity leads you through the exercise of remembering happy moments to replay positive emotions. ""It is extremely scientifically based and (an) unusually powerful app,"" Jain said. If you aren't sure whether what you're feeling could be classified as depression or anxiety, there's a free tool called depressioncheck. This app offers a three-minute screening for anxiety and depression. Of course, it's not meant to replace a real mental health professional's evaluation; you should seek consultation with a licensed therapist before trying to make any diagnoses on your own. For those who have bipolar disorder, there's an app called Bipolar Disorder Connect. This free app is a gateway into a community of people living with bipolar disorder. Users ask each other questions and talk about treatments. Finally, the National Center for Telehealth and Technology, part of the U.S. Department of Defense, has put out an intriguing suite of mental health apps as well. PTSD Coach, co-created by the VA's National Center for post-traumatic stress disorder, includes a PTSD self-assessment and information about the condition. Relaxation skill tools and anger management techniques are part of the program. It is intended for veterans and military service members. And for a simple guided relaxation program, check out Tactical Breather, from the same group. A voice guides you through inhalations and exhalations that, according to the website, ""can be used to gain control over physiological and psychological responses to stress."" It was developed for combat situations but can be used by anyone for stress management at any time.","The Live OCD Free app makes use of OCD therapy techniques .

"(CNN) -- Gwyneth Paltrow may have given more ammunition to ""the enemy."" The actress has come under fire for likening the impact of negative online comments to being in a war, according to an interview she gave to Re/Code. While discussing those trolls who make nasty, anonymous comments online, Paltrow called the effect of their insults ""dehumanizing."" ""You come across (online comments) about yourself and about your friends, and it's a very dehumanizing thing,"" Paltrow said, according to the interview. ""It's almost like how, in war, you go through this bloody, dehumanizing thing, and then something is defined out of it. My hope is, as we get out of it, we'll reach the next level of conscience."" That bit of introspection did not go over well. Cindy McCain, wife of Sen. John McCain -- a former prisoner of war -- tweeted, ""Gweneth Paltrow is a joke. Her life is like taking bullets for a soldier. What a joke! My 2 sons serving in the military should talk to her."" She further tweeted, ""Perhaps Gweneth Paltrow should go out on patrol with some soldiers. Kind of like a Red Carpet in her mind I guess!"" It's not the first time the star has stirred strife with her comments. In March she faced criticism after she told E! it was ""much harder"" for her as both a mother and a celebrity. ""I think it's different when you have an office job, because it's routine and, you know, you can do all the stuff in the morning and then you come home in the evening,"" she said. ""When you're shooting a movie, they're like, 'We need you to go to Wisconsin for two weeks,' and then you work 14 hours a day and that part of it is very difficult.

"Commuters encountered an unexpected passenger when they boarded a New York City subway train early Wednesday: a shark. A still wet 1-and-a-half foot shark carcass was discovered on the floor of a subway car at around midnight in downtown Manhattan. ""I thought it was just a plush toy or a prank,"" passenger Juan Cano told CNN. ""When I saw the teeth that's I knew it was real, it was no toy."" The shark, described as weighing between five to 10 pounds, was discovered near a row of seats by passengers on the Queens-bound N train at the 14th Street stop. The shark had blood on its mouth, as though it has recently been punctured by a fishing hook, according to Cano. The shark quickly drew a crowd, as entering subway riders began to photograph and pose with the shark, even adding a subway fare card, soft drink can and a cigarette to the supine shark as props. After several stops, an MTA official entered the train at Queensboro Plaza, cleared it of passengers, and locked its doors, Metropolitan Transit Authority spokesmen Kevin Ortiz told CNN.  The shark was removed later that night and disposed of. The shark's species was never identified. MTA officials were unable to ""determine the shark's origin,"" according to Ortiz. This is not the first case of a mysterious shark appearance. In Nantucket last week, a  5-foot-long shark carcass was discovered outside the door of a bar on Water Street. ""I have no idea how or why it got there."" Sea Dog Brew Pub manager Jim Agnew told CNN. Asked whether anything out of the ordinary happened that evening, Agnew could only point to having to ask two people to leave, but those were ""peaceful ejections"" he said -- adding that the customs had since returned to the bar. Some have speculated that the appearance of sharks in mysterious places is a publicity stunt for the Discovery Channel's ""Shark Week."" Photos of the two mysterious sharks have exploded on social media using the hashtag #sharkweek. Discovery Channel denies any involvement. ""Shark Week is all about conservation, so it deeply saddens us that someone would think that this was funny or in any way connected to our celebration of sharks,"" said spokeswoman Laurie Goldberg. MTA officials told CNN they have no plans to ""continue investigating"" how the shark got on the subway.","Shark carcass found on subway .

"The chilling images from North Korea brought back memories from one of the most disturbing and important moments of none other than Saddam Hussein's tactics for establishing his iron-clad rule of Iraq. The young North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un, it appears, has learned from the most ruthless and long-lasting of modern dictators. On Monday, North Korea's citizens saw what would have seemed impossible just a few months ago: The man who had stood at Kim's side since he came to power, his uncle Jang Song Thaek, publicly humiliated in a shake-up that signaled a fierce power struggle and sent a stern message to the country and the world. The televised footage showed what unfolded during the meeting of the party's Central Committee, reportedly the day before. In a room of stunned party members, two uniformed soldiers grabbed Jang -- until recently the country's second most powerful man -- and took him away after he was accused of betraying Kim and the revolution. Just a few days later, on Thursday, the North Korea government-controlled Korean Central News Agency reported that Jang had been executed for betraying the regime: ""Despicable human scum Jang, who was worse than a dog, perpetrated thrice-cursed acts of treachery in betrayal of such profound trust and warmest paternal love shown by the party and the leader for him."" Decades-old grainy black and white images from Iraq tell a similar story of power and intrigue whose consequences are now well-known. On July 22, 1979, during a meeting of Iraq's Baath Party, the names of 60 top party leaders labeled traitors were read as, one by one, the terrified men were removed from the hall. That footage was also distributed widely -- a sign to all that Hussein would let no one stand in his way, instilling fear even among the most powerful in the country. It was a moment that as much as any other cemented Hussein's rule for almost a quarter of a century. In keeping with the totalitarians' textbook, the North Korean regime denounced Kim's uncle in language that would be familiar to those who have lived under the worst dictatorships. The masterpiece of totalitarian prose, published for all to read in the state media, accused Jang of leading a ""dissolute and depraved life."" It condemns him for pretending to support Kim while ""dreaming different dreams,"" and living a life of corruption, ambition, drug use, ""wining and dining at back parlors and deluxe restaurants,"" as well as ""gambling in foreign casinos at the party's expense"" and being ""affected by the capitalist way of living."" Kim's uncle, the regime charges, was ""behaving against the elementary sense of moral obligation and conscience of a human being."" Most of all, Jang -- married to the sister of Kim's late father, former leader Kim Jong Il --  is accused of planning to challenge his nephew and undermine him as ""unitary center"" of the state. It's a stunning ledger of charges and one that makes no effort to conceal there is a power struggle in North Korea. Tellingly, the accusations speak of a Jang Song Thaek ""group,"" which suggests the purge is far from over. There have already been reports that a couple of Jang associates were executed. State media has followed the reports with a scrubbing of the files. Jang is being erased from the records. The man who stood at Kim's side when his father died is being Photoshopped out of existence. All mentions of him -- except for the condemnations -- are disappearing from the website of the Korean Central News Agency.  And every photograph is now suddenly, and not-so-mysteriously, free of his image. He has even been deleted from a recent documentary about Kim Jong Un. The question is what comes next: What does this mean for the millions of North Koreans living under Kim's brutal rule? How does this execution and purge affect nuclear-armed North Korea's behavior on the global stage? Jang was known as something of a reformer, although that term must be viewed within the context of the totalitarian regime. He supported limited market reforms and reportedly opposed Pyongyang's nuclear test earlier this year -- both positions that put him at odds with the military. There is little doubt that Jang's execution strengthens the military's hand. The experience from Iraq suggests that a reign of fear among the powerful serves only to entrench the harshest policies. High-ranking officials, worried about appearing weak or disloyal, will be more reluctant to suggest reforms that loosen the regime's grip. That is dismal news for those who live in a state that is the world's worst violator of human rights. A new report from Amnesty International  says as many as 200,000 North Koreans, including children, the elderly and generations of families live in prison camps where they routinely endure torture, starvation and worse. Life outside the camps is also subject to harsh conditions for most North Koreans. When the younger Kim came to power in 2011 after his father died, some held hope that his time living in Switzerland had instilled reformist instincts, expecting he would moderate domestic policies and undertake more conciliatory actions toward the rest of the world. But so far, he has proven as defiant and inflexible as his father and grandfather. In a major crisis a year ago, he launched long-range missiles and later detonated  a nuclear weapon and then threatened a nuclear attack against the U.S. and South Korea. Kim may now want to prevent anyone from taking advantage of turmoil in Pyongyang with another show of force. It is not clear what exactly caused the high-level purge. The military might have triggered and won the clash with Jang. Some suggest Kim may now be a figurehead in a military-led regime, but he already reshuffled the military command. He appears to be in control. More likely, however, Kim is consolidating power, much like Hussein did in 1979. He is building his own inner circle of trustworthy loyalists and daring anyone to defy him. The young heir who rose to power two years ago under the protection of an experienced uncle is sending notice that he is not a child any more. The dictator is all grown up and settling in for a long time in power.","Kim Jong Un accused his uncle of betrayal; North Korea media say uncle was executed .

"Opening statements in the trial of actress Nicollette Sheridan's claim that her ""Desperate Housewives"" character was killed off because she complained about mistreatment by the TV show's creator were delayed Wednesday morning as the judge considered an evidence dispute. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Elizabeth Allen White tossed reporters from the courtroom while she heard arguments over whether the jury should hear conversations that may have been protected by attorney-client privilege. Once lawyers deliver their openings to the jury, Sheridan is expected to testify in her wrongful termination lawsuit against series creator-producer-writer Marc Cherry and ABC. Several of Sheridan's former cast mates -- including Eva Longoria, Marcia Cross, James Denton, Felicity Huffman and Neal McDonough -- are on the list of witnesses expected to defend Cherry. The suit contends that Cherry created ""a hostile work environment"" from the show's beginning in 2004. ""Cherry has a reputation for behaving in an extremely abusive and aggressive manner toward the individuals who work on the show, and is known for regularly demeaning the writers and staff in front of others on the show, including Sheridan,"" the suit says. Cherry focused his hostility on Sheridan in the fifth season when ""Cherry consistently behaved in a dismissive, demeaning and unprofessional manner toward Sheridan, not only in front of the other cast and crew on the show, but before the public at large,"" it says. This ""hostility and aggression toward Sheridan culminated"" on the set of the show on September 24, 2008, the suit says. The suit alleges that ""during a rehearsal for the show, when Sheridan questioned Cherry about something that was in the script, Cherry took her aside and forcefully hit her with his hand across her face and head."" Sheridan complained to ABC executives about the September 2008 incident, but ""nevertheless, Cherry's abusive and aggressive behavior towards Sheridan not only persisted, it worsened,"" the suit contends. ""He continued to behave in a derisive and condescending manner toward Sheridan."" Eleven episodes later, in March 2009, her character, Edie Britt, was electrocuted after a car crash, ending Sheridan's employment on the series. Defense lawyers argue that Cherry ""lightly tapped her head in giving her direction for a scene,"" and ""the decision that the character of Edie would die was made before the incident and was primarily a creative decision."" Sheridan's lawyers contend it is ""exceptionally unusual for a popular character to be killed off or written out of a television series unless the actor has requested to be released from his or her contract."" Sheridan lost at least $20 million by missing out on the last three seasons, the suit says. Her pay was to be $250,000 for each episode in the eighth year, which is the final season for the series, it said. Lawyers estimated in court filings that testimony in the trial could last more than two weeks.","Nicollette Sheridan claims show creator-producer Marc Cherry hit her during a 2008 rehearsal .

"(CNN)A man who fell from a Royal Caribbean cruise ship off the coast of Cozumel, Mexico, was rescued by a Disney cruise ship after passengers spotted him on the water, Mexican authorities say. ""The man was traveling in the Oasis (of the Seas). It was early in the morning. He doesn't remember how he fell. Fortunately, another cruise, the Disney Magic, saw him,"" said Cozumel Port Captain Alfonso Rodríguez. The lucky man, a 22-year-old U.S. citizen, had been in the water for about five hours during last Thursday's ordeal, Rodriguez said. ""At 7:31 a.m. a passenger aboard Disney Magic reported a man in the water. The passenger had thrown multiple lifesavers in the water to help him,"" said Rodriguez. ""They rescued him and gave him medical attention."" The man was taken to a local hospital and was in good condition before he was flown back to the United States, Rodriguez said. ""This man was reborn. Most people that experience that kind of fall break their neck. It's like hitting concrete,"" he said. Rescue caught on camera . David Hearn, a Disney Magic passenger, recorded the rescue. In his video, a yellow rescue boat bobs on dark ocean waters, and a man's head and arms are barely visible above the waves. The man then swims toward the boat and is brought aboard. ""We were in our stateroom. On the speaker system, we heard the crew saying 'Mister M-O-B, starboard side.' I got dressed and went up to the upper deck,"" Hearn said. M-O-B is the code used for ""man overboard."" When Hearn reached the Magic's upper deck, the ship's crew had already lowered the lifeboat. ""It was pretty surreal at first. It's not something you expect when you go on a nice cruise,"" Hearn said. ""Our first question was, where did he come from? We thought it was someone that fell off our ship."" Hearn said he spoke to the passenger credited with spotting the man in the water. ""His daughter had gotten up, and they had a room with a balcony. She wanted to sit out there, and he went with her,"" Hearn recalled. ""They heard a noise, and as the ship got closer, they realized it was a man screaming for help. They got on the phone with guest services, and the ship came to a stop."" Safety at sea? Royal Caribbean closed-circuit TV video showed the man was alone on the Oasis ship Deck 5 when he went overboard at 6:07 a.m. ""There were no other guests or crew around at the time,"" said Cynthia Martinez, a Royal Caribbean spokeswoman. CNN's request for the video was denied. Oasis of the Seas is one of the world's largest ships, with room for more than 8,000 passengers and crew. It had departed from Port Everglades, Florida, on January 3, and Cozumel was the last port of call, Martinez said. The ship's safety features include a minimum safety railing of 42 inches and more than 1,200 security cameras. ""For their (passengers') safety, we recommend that guests not lean over or climb on any railing,"" said Martinez. But Miami-based maritime lawyer Jim Walker says these measures are not enough. Instead, he advocates automatic man overboard detection systems. ""This poor guy was pretty lucky. The real issues is why he fell off the ship and why there is no clear explanation,"" Walker said. Automatic man overboard detection technology uses radar and sensors to establish a perimeter around a ship. A mechanism notifies the crew when a person has fallen overboard. One manufacturer of these systems, Mobtronic, boasted a 95% man overboard detection rate. The Cruise Vessel Safety and Security Act requires large passenger ships to ""integrate technology that can be used for capturing images of passengers or detecting passengers who have fallen overboard, to the extent that such technology is available."" Unlike this incident, Walker said, the problem with most man overboard cases is that the person is never found and the case goes unsolved. ""There are some people who commit suicide,"" he said. ""The suicides are easily detected because the person leaves a message or doesn't bring any luggage onto the ship, or they sell their homes, et cetera. But there are a whole group of cases that don't fall on the suicide pattern. There are other cases which we suspect are a result of foul play."" A website that tracks man overboard cases, CruiseJunkie.com, listed 243 cases since 1995.","Cozumel authorities say the man was at sea for about five hours .

"(CNN)Among the major artists playing at this year's New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival are the Who, Elton John, Keith Urban, John Legend and Wilco. Wait. Isn't this supposed to be a jazz festival? It is -- and it isn't. There are 12 stages going, and you can still hear plenty of jazz, blues and local performers, including the Meters, the Radiators, Dr. John, the Rebirth Jazz Band and Rockin' Dopsie Jr. & the Zydeco Twisters. Sure, it's not the festival rooted in Pete Fountain and the Neville Brothers it once was, but David Freedman doesn't have a problem with it. ""It's really that not much of a tragedy,"" said Freedman, the general manager of New Orleans' local music-oriented station, WWOZ. ""I know some people see it that way, but the fact of the matter is, you can still hear all the great acts. If you want to have a good time going to the 'old jazz fest,' it's still there."" (It should be noted that WWOZ broadcasts more than 30 hours from the site.) AEG, the giant entertainment company, is now the driving force behind Jazz Fest, leading to the influx of big names. Previous years have featured Bruce Springsteen and Fleetwood Mac as headliners. The change in focus started happening after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Freedman says. The festival also brings in a great deal of money for local organizations and musicians, many of whom get far more exposure playing in front of crowds of thousands -- or tens of thousands -- than they would at small clubs. ""A lot of the local acts get in front of the Elton John fans,"" Freedman said. ""If, in fact, it turned into a pop fest, I wouldn't even bother with it,"" he added and chuckled. ""And 'OZ isn't interested in Elton John no matter how big he is."" The 2015 New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival will be held at the city's Fair Grounds from April 24 to May 3.

"(CNN)The killings of 12 journalists and others at Charlie Hebdo in Paris has led many to wonder about the role of Islam in fueling vicious attacks on civilians in the name of the religion. Policymakers wring their hands about how to curtail the spread of extremist religious ideologies that terrorize Western targets, but also Muslims and non-Muslim minorities in the Middle East, who are extremism's primary victims. Where are some Muslims getting the idea that violence against journalists who offend them is OK? Why do they see beheadings as a fitting punishment? A good place to look for answers would be to examine Saudi Arabia's policies of intolerance and extremism. King Abdullah, as the protector of Islam's most sacred religious sites and leader of Saudi Arabia, is widely considered an important role model for Muslims around the world. So it should not come as a surprise that many Muslims take their cues from the country on the prohibitions and punishments they consider appropriate to inflict on those who challenge or disagree with their interpretations of Islam. Saudi Arabia gave a good indication of its position on appropriate punishments last  Friday, when it carried out Round 1 of a public flogging -- 50 lashes -- against Raif Badawi, a young blogger, in front of the al-Jafali mosque in Jeddah. A Saudi court had fined Badawi and sentenced him in 2014 to 1,000 lashes over 20 sessions and to 10 years in prison for the crime of ""insulting Islam"" -- in part for setting up a liberal website to debate various topics, including religion. Badawi is not the only Saudi who has faced punishment for his perceived views. The government has jailed many leading intellectuals, writers, and activists who have dared to question any tenet of the orthodoxy imposed by the country's Wahabi religious leaders. A former colleague of Badawi,  Su`ad al-Shammari, was jailed in late 2014 on charges of ""insulting the messenger and the hadith"" in connection with tweets that allegedly criticized religious authorities. In October, a Saudi court sentenced a Shiite cleric, Nimr al-Nimr, to death for criticizing the government and ""breaking allegiance with the ruler."" The prosecutor had sought what the Saudis call a crucifixion sentence, the kingdom's harshest, in which the convicted person is beheaded and the decapitated body displayed in public. There is so much shock and outrage about ISIS propaganda videotapes showing its beheadings of journalists in Iraq and Syria -- and most recently, the reported beheadings of two Tunisian journalists in Libya. But the much more routine and widespread beheadings by Saudi Arabia get little scrutiny and condemnation.  Saudi Arabia beheaded at least 26 people last August alone. The 82 executions in 2014 make Saudi Arabia a world leader in capital punishment. Saudi Interior Ministry news releases indicate that about half of them were for nonviolent crimes, the other half for drug offenses and one for sorcery. Yes, you read that right. In 2014, Saudi Arabia was still beheading people for ""sorcery."" So is it really any surprise that extremist groups -- also acting in the name of Islam -- seem to be following Saudi's lead, meting out their own severe punishments against journalists and activists they find offensive? If Saudi Arabia thinks publicly beheading people comports with Islamic religious teachings and deters those who also might want to criticize them or question their religion, why shouldn't ISIS? One might argue that a nation, unlike some self-designated Islamic Caliphate, has the legitimacy and authority to exercise state-sponsored violence, including against its own citizens. But countries also have obligations to respect human rights. Saudi Arabia's abusive prosecutions and cruel punishments flout these obligations, and undermine its own legitimacy. There is probably little governments and policymakers can do to influence the ideology of extremist armed groups. But there's a lot more they can and should do to influence the policies and practices of purported allies in the ""war on terror.""  That includes the anti-ISIS coalition, to which Saudi Arabia and many other unaccountable, authoritarian, and deeply abusive Arab governments belong. While the United States and United Kingdom governments' statements condemning Badawi's flogging were a good start, more often these countries are utterly silent in the face of Saudi Arabia's grotesque abuses against its own citizens. The West's denunciations of ISIS abuses have less credibility when governments carrying out similar abuses, if much smaller in scale and magnitude, are good chums, strong allies, and important investors. If the international community is serious about taking on Islamist extremist ideologies -- if it  wants to see real models of tolerance, respect for diverse viewpoints, religious freedom, and the free and peaceful exchange of ideas — it must urge King Abdullah to be the true protector of the rights of Muslims around the world. For a start, he can overturn the sentence against Badawi and release dozens of detained activists and writers. He could even abolish beheadings, overnight, if that is what he wanted. ..","Sarah Leah Whitson: Blogger's flogging most recent example of Saudi's extreme punishment .

"Washington (CNN)One's out and another looks like he's back in. And another is building up his 2016 team. The 2016 Republican presidential field has been shaping up in more ways than one in the last week. Here's who's stirring the pot, and what they're mixing in: . Romney, Romney ... Romney? A week after former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush spent his time locking in support from the Republican establishment's top GOP donors, former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney set fire to the political world on Friday when he signaled to a roomful of donors that he's seriously considering a 2016 presidential bid. Romney is giving more than just a cursory glance at his 2016 presidential prospects. After meeting with prospective donors, Romney reportedly spent the weekend phoning former operatives and backers, signaling that he's not kidding about a three-peat presidential campaign. Romney is also headed to a Republican National Committee meeting near San Diego this week, a get together that will include other potential 2016ers including Ben Carson, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Texas Gov. Rick Perry. The former nominee's moves over the weekend are the surest sign yet that he will enter what is expected to be a competitive fray of Republican contenders duking it out for the nomination. The buzz comes months after Romney kicked up speculation this summer when he gave several interviews suggesting that while a 2016 run was unlikely, it wasn't completely out of the question. And Romney's wife, who went back and forth this summer on whether Romney 2016 was a possibility -- ultimately settling on ""we never say never"" --  is now reportedly on board. It's Romney's sons who are split, according to sources who spoke with Romney this weekend. The move could set up a battle of political heavyweights between the Romney and Bush operations -- one few expected just last week. Chris Christie launching PAC . Fresh off his State of the State speech, The New York Times broke the news Tuesday night that the New Jersey governor is preparing to set up a leadership political action committee as soon as this month to finance his political travel and allow him to begin fundraising. It'll likely be run by Phil Cox, who worked with Christie at the Republican Governors Association. Meanwhile, well-known New York businessman and GOP fundraiser Ken Langone is hosting a dinner next week that will allow Christie to discuss his plans with major donors. Christie will follow that dinner with a trip to the Iowa Freedom Summit, a conservative event hosted by Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa. Rand Paul taps campaign manager . The Washington Post reported on Tuesday that Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky is hiring Chip Englander to run his likely 2016 presidential campaign -- while Doug Stafford will remain Paul's chief political adviser. The hiring of Englander, a California political veteran who ran Republican Bruce Rauner's successful bid for the Illinois governor's office in 2014, gives Paul a veteran hand who has won in blue states. Paul Ryan a no-go . As Romney is jumping back in, his former running mate Rep. Paul Ryan is shutting down speculation over a presidential run of his own. ""After giving it a lot of thought, I've decided not to run for president,"" Ryan said Monday in a statement, pointing instead to his focus as the new chair of the House Ways and Means Committee as his priority. Ryan insisted despite the conspicuous timing that he came to a decision over the holidays, well before Romney seized headlines this weekend with talk of another run. Ryan has been a steadfast Romney supporter since before the former Massachusetts governor tapped him as his vice presidential pick. Walker makes moves . The governor of Wisconsin, widely viewed as a rising Republican star, is set to launch a new political organization in the coming weeks, laying the groundwork for a potential presidential campaign. Walker brought on a national political strategist who would serve as his campaign manager in the event of a potential run, GOP sources told CNN's Peter Hamby. And remember, he'll be headed to the RNC meeting, too, this week. But like a pair of other Republican governors with presidential ambitions, Walker could face some questions on his handling of his state's economy in an eventual campaign. Mike Huckabee . Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee is giving America a taste of a classic pre-presidential campaign move: he's releasing a new book. Huckabee's book, ""God, Guns, Grits, and Gravy,"" hits stores next week, but a sneak peak reveals an interesting mishmash of insight into Huckabee's brain. The release comes after Huckabee quit his Fox News show earlier this month to give a 2016 campaign a serious look. The book's got everything from musings on Miley Cyrus and BeyoncÃ© to an explanation of his views on homosexuality and even his thoughts on his potential 2016 rivals. Jeb Bush . So, Jeb Bush didn't have the best week after Romney swooped in and stole some of his thunder -- and nearly all of the headlines. But Bush did give donors a glimpse at what his 2016 operation would look like during his first fundraiser for his new Leadership PAC, ""Right to Rise."" A few snippets include promoting a muscular American foreign policy and his plan to pursue a diverse electorate. Ben Carson . The tea party conservative who has been inching toward a presidential run took some heat last week over plagiarism allegations. Carson apologized after he was caught lifting material from unattributed sources in his book, America the Beautiful. ""I attempted to appropriately cite and acknowledge all sources in America the Beautiful, but inadvertently missed some. I apologize, and I am working with my editors to rectify the situation,"" Carson said in a statement to CNN. ...What about the Democrats? Efforts to recruit Sen. Elizabeth Warren are still underway, former Virginia Gov. Jim Webb is breaking in a new knee and Hillary Clinton hasn't made a public appearance in almost a month. As the Republican field keeps shifting, Democrats are left wondering...what field? Progressive groups are holding a rally on Saturday in an effort to get Warren to jump in, but the liberal senator is looking more like she won't run in 2016, giving Fortune magazine a flat ""no"" when asked whether she'll run for President -- her most decisive answer yet. Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley wants voters to know he's not out of the running, though. He told an audience on Thursday that he is ""seriously considering"" a presidential run.","Romney stole the show of potential 2016 candidates this weekend, telling donors and operatives that he's looking at 2016 .

"(CNN)Central American migrants en route to the United States face incredibly tough odds. If they're not tossed from a train or left in a desert, they may be cheated -- or worse. ""People would tell me: 'Well, we've kind of accepted, or, we're used to being robbed and beaten and raped,' "" photographer Michelle Frankfurter said. ""They're willing to risk all that,"" she said. ""It sheds some light on just how bad things are in Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala."" Between 2009 and 2014, Frankfurter took several trips to Mexico to document migrants' journey from the country's southern border to its northern one. She was inspired by ""Enrique's Journey,"" a book by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Sonia Nazario, which tells the story of a Honduran boy risking it all to reunite with his mother in the United States. ""I watched these people leave everything behind -- leave with nothing but a little backpack with a few belongings -- and then this faith that they have,"" Frankfurter said. ""There's a lot of sadness and deprivation, but there's a lot of beauty in it as well,"" she said. She described her favorite photograph from the series (No. 11 in the gallery above). Taken inside a makeshift chapel, it shows a crucifix, a wounded man and several migrants resting on the floor alongside dogs. Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. ""I've been to that particular place a number of times and I never ever saw that kind of confluence of elements together in one single image like that,"" she said. ""Everything to me is in that one photograph."" Frankfurter found people to follow at shelters. She'd spend a couple days with a group before venturing out to the rail yard and hopping a train. She takes a long-view approach. Rather than see the current rush of migrants as something like the break of a dam, Frankfurter has watched the pressure build for decades -- as civil wars, trade policies and a booming drug trade combine to squeeze people from all sides. She lived in Nicaragua in the late 1990s. ""I kept thinking that I would see that wave taper off ... and instead there was just this dramatic spike,"" Frankfurter said. ""It seems like a story that just keeps mutating in a way, but just keeps on going, and that there is no real end to it."" Michelle Frankfurter is a photographer based in Maryland.

"(CNN)It is a message of defiance, but also forgiveness -- and many Muslims responded with similarly mixed emotions. It is a magazine cover depicting the Prophet Mohammed with a tear falling from his cheek, holding a sign that says, ""Je suis Charlie,"" the slogan that became a worldwide meme. Above Mohammed are the words ""All Is Forgiven."" On Wednesday, two Muslim extremists attacked the offices of Charlie Hebdo, a French magazine with a history of mocking Mohammed. Twelve were killed, including several top editors, by two men with terrorist connections who said they were avenging the prophet. Many Muslims object to any depictions of Mohammed -- respectful or not -- saying that such images defy his teachings and lead to idolatry. For the secular satirists at Charlie Hebdo, neither of those concerns seemed to matter much. They often lampooned Mohammed, crudely caricaturing him as a backward, foolish figure. It's not surprising that, in its first issue since the attack, Charlie Hebdo again put Mohammed on the cover. But this time, instead of showing the prophet in an unflattering light, the magazine struck a far different tone -- and was received by some Muslims in a far different way. ""My initial thought is that the cover is a near perfect response to the tragedy,"" said Hussein Rashid, a professor of Islamic thought at Hofstra University in New York. ""They are not backing down from the depiction of Mohammed, exercising their free speech rights. At the same time, the message is conciliatory, humble, and will hopefully reduce the anger directed to the Muslim communities of France."" Zineb El Rhazoui, a columnist at Charlie Hebdo magazine who worked on the new issue, told the BBC that the staff didn't want to express hatred toward the terrorists who killed her colleagues. ""The (mobilization) that happened in France after this horrible crime must open the door to forgiveness. Everyone must think about this forgiveness."" Chosen by Charlie Hebdo's editors on Monday night, the cover was released by Liberation, the French newspaper that is sharing its office space with staffers from the satirical magazine. Many media outlets have republished the cover in a show of solidarity. The issue will hit newsstands this Wednesday in a flood of 3 million copies translated into multiple languages. As the new cover spreads across social media, Muslims responded with a mix of emotions, from wariness to appreciation, from miffed to dismissive. Yahya Adel Ibrahim, an imam in Australia, counseled his 100,000 Facebook followers to follow the example of Mohammed, even if they encounter images that they believe are blasphemous. ""As it is clear that the cartoons are to be published again, Muslims will inevitably be hurt and angered, but our reaction must be a reflection of the teachings of the one we love & are angered for,"" Ibrahim said. ""Enduring patience, tolerance, gentleness and mercy  was the character of our beloved Prophet."" On Twitter, some Muslims were skeptical that publishing an image that many consider offensive should be construed as an act of solidarity. Other Muslims said they appreciate the magazine's sentiments. Rashid noted that the cover's central message -- forgiveness -- resonates not only throughout Islam but through other faiths as well. ""The cover is a call to our better angels, and an acknowledgment that religion also offers good to the world."" Other Muslim leaders criticized the cover. ""That the depiction appears benign is of little consequence because it will be seen as offensive and deliberately provocative,"" said Dawud Walid, executive director of the Michigan chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. There's nothing in the Quran, Islam's primary text, about depicting the prophet. But according to the hadith -- stories and sayings attributed to Mohammed and his companions -- he discouraged Muslims from making images of him. Walid said that Charlie Hebdo's new cover ""will offend many"" but noted that ""over 99.999% of France's 5 million Muslims acted peacefully when the previous depiction was released."" Yasir Qadhi, an American cleric with a wide following, said he's not pleased by any depictions of Mohammed, but it's clear that this Hebdo cover, unlike others, is not meant to make fun of Muslims. Qadhi also said that while he respects the right to free speech, there appears to be a double standard when it comes to what Western society -- and Hebdo -- find suitable for mocking. ""Did you happen to notice any cartoons mocking the death of the cartoonists themselves, and lampooning their work and efforts?"" Qadhi asked. Satire of the type attempted by Charlie Hebdo often serves a valuable end, said Omid Safi, director of Islamic studies at Duke University. But Safi faulted the French magazine for misfiring in its choice of targets. ""I see satire as always having a purpose of mocking the powers that be, hierarchy, power, unearned privileged. So who are we speaking power to today?"" Safi said. ""Sure, violent terrorists. But what about all the other agents of violence, including the state-sponsored ones? That's why I don't find Charlie Hebdo particularly good satire."" Many Muslims seemed content not to comment on Hebdo's latest depiction of their prophet, or to pay it no mind. ""Let us ignore the provocations and defamation and get about the work of being a source of good and mercy to all we may come into contact with,"" Imam Zaid Shakir, a popular cleric and scholar from California, posted on Facebook this week. ""May Allah bless you all and make things easy for you and your families during these trying times."" CNN's Brian Stelter contributed to this report.","Some Muslims appreciate new Charlie Hebdo cover, while others are dismissive .

"The impact of the drought currently gripping the United States is real and tangible, as millions can attest. But the depth of the pain still falls short of that experienced by many in the Great Plains and beyond during the so-called Dust Bowl era of the 1930s.

"(CNN)It may bear more than a passing resemblance to Barad-dur, the dark fortress of Sauron depicted in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, but the Al Noor Tower could become the tallest building on the African continent if construction begins as planned later this year. The project is slated for the picturesque city of Casablanca in Morocco and is being proposed by Dubai-based construction firm, Middle East Development LLC, in conjunction with French architects Valode & Pistre. Aside from a stylishly swish exterior, features of the 114-story building include offices, apartments, a seven star luxury hotel, an art gallery and a luxury arcade of shops. While a definitive date for breaking ground has still to be settled, its location finalized and full agreement of the Moroccan authorities sought, the tower's designer told CNN that the project is progressing as planned. ""Our goal is to start the soil testing in June 2015,"" said Amedee Santalo. ""Then the engineering studies will take another few months (six to nine) and the construction should take two and a half to three years maximum to be completed."" If permission is granted, Santalo believes the building will be the first of many large skyscrapers that will spring up across Africa in the coming years. He adds that this a sign of the continent's growing strength and potential. At 540 meters tall (designed specifically as a recognition of Africa's 54 countries) Al Noor would currently rank as the fifth tallest building in the world, in between Taipei 101 (501 meters) and One World Trade Center (541 meters), according to data from the Emporis building directory. ""Africa will have, in the next 15 years, thousands of towers,"" Santalo said. ""The continent has an amazing potential with a lots of virgin places and a population of over a billion."" Santalo added that Morocco's stability, favorable landscape and the fact that it was at the gateway between Europe and Africa made it an attractive location for such a large development. The current tallest building in Africa is the  223-meter tall Carlton Center in Johannesburg.","The Al Noor Tower in Casablanca has been proposed by a Dubai-based construction company .

"Ordering lunch just got a lot more complicated than deciding how to answer, ""Do you want fries with that?"" Chick-fil-A President Dan Cathy sparked reactions that were swift and strong after he weighed in on same-sex marriage by saying his company backs the traditional family unit. Politicians from Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel to former GOP presidential candidate Rick Santorum spoke up. Supporters and opponents of same-sex marriage protested. And suddenly, the type of fast-food bag you carry could reveal your views on a hot-button social issue that has split the country. Some proponents of same-sex marriage have decried Cathy's comments and called for a boycott of the chain, which had annual sales of more than $4.1 billion last year and has more than 1,615 locations in 39 states and Washington, D.C., with the strongest concentration in the Southeast. ""How backward and ignorant ... how sad,"" CNN reader Joe Brown said. ""No more Chick-fil-A for me. I am not in the stone-casting business as a Christian."" Evangelist Billy Graham defends Chick-fil-A . The Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD), meanwhile, is promoting a National Same-Sex Kiss Day to be held at Chick-fil-A restaurants across the country on August 3. The Atlanta-based Chick-fil-A, for its part, has gained the support of such high-profile leaders as the Rev. Billy Graham. Graham has praised restaurant founder S. Truett Cathy and son Don Cathy ""for their strong stand for the Christian faith."" ""I've known their family for many years and have watched them grow Chick-fil-A into one of the best businesses in America while never compromising their values,"" Graham said, breaking his usual silence on hot-button issues. Regular customers of the chain also have shown their loyalty to Chick-fil-A, posting messages on the company's Facebook page since the controversy broke out. CNN reader Greg Tanner said his appreciation for Chick-fil-A ""tripled"" after he heard about Cathy's comments. ""I've always loved their chicken. I was always bummed yet respected them for closing on Sundays. Even though I'm a foxhole Christian and don't practice any particular religion, I do wholly believe that marriage is between a man and woman. ... Stand up for what you believe!"" Tanner said. Politicos such as Santorum and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee are also showing their support. Huckabee has called for a ""Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day"" next Wednesday. Henson, Huckabee take sides in Chick-fil-A same-sex marriage controversy . ""I have been incensed at the vitriolic assaults on the Chick-fil-A company because the CEO, Dan Cathy, made comments recently in which he affirmed his view that the Biblical view of marriage should be upheld,"" Huckabee, a Republican, wrote in a Facebook posting announcing the event. He called for supporters to ""simply affirm appreciation for a company run by Christian principles by showing up"" at their local Chick-fil-A next week. As of Friday afternoon, nearly 300,000 had accepted a Facebook invitation to participate in the event. But at the local level, Chick-fil-A is meeting resistance from city officials in Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia and San Francisco. Philadelphia City Councilman James Kenney sent a letter to Cathy this week, telling the CEO in blunt terms to ""take a hike and take your intolerance with you,"" and vowing to introduce a resolution at the next council meeting condemning the company. ""There is no place for this type of hate in our great City of Brotherly and Sisterly Affection,"" Kenney wrote. San Francisco Mayor Edwin M. Lee tweeted: ""Closest #ChickFilA to San Francisco is 40 miles away & I strongly recommend that they not try to come any closer."" In Chicago, Alderman Joe Moreno has been working for months to block construction of a Chick-fil-A in his district, citing traffic congestion and worry about the company's ""business practices."" Mayor Emanuel, a Democrat, said this week that ""Chick-fil-A's values are not Chicago values. They're not respectful of our residents, our neighbors and our family members."" 9 religious companies (besides Chick-fil-A) And in Boston, where Chick-fil-A is considering opening a location, Mayor Thomas Menino, also a Democrat, made it clear the chain would not be welcome. ""I don't want an individual who will continue to advocate against people's rights. That's who I am and that's what Boston's all about,"" he said. Chick-fil-A responded to the firestorm this week by defending its company culture and saying it would stay out of political debates in the future. ""The Chick-fil-A culture and service tradition in our restaurants is to treat every person with honor, dignity and respect -- regardless of their belief, race, creed, sexual orientation or gender,"" a company statement said. ""We will continue this tradition in the over 1,600 restaurants run by independent owner/operators."" The statement has done little to quiet the uproar as protesters rallied Thursday at the grand opening of a Chick-fil-A in Laguna Hills, California, and disrupted planned festivities for the day. Roughly 250 participants carried signs emblazoned with rainbows and messages of support for gay rights. ""Those kinds of messages and that kind of rhetoric is very, very hurtful to our families,"" Laura Kanter, youth program director at LGBT advocacy group The Center Orange County, told CNN affiliate KABC of Cathy's comments. ""We have families, we have children, we have parents."" In Washington, protesters gathered where a Chick-fil-A food truck had parked for the lunch hour Thursday and said they would continue to follow it as it moves around the district. Readers defend Chick-fil-A's stance on marriage . The groundswell of opposition to the chain could reflect changing attitudes about same-sex marriage. A CNN/ORC poll last month found that a majority of Americans support same-sex marriage, reflecting a dramatic shift in public opinion over the last two decades. Despite the growing support, voters in 31 states have approved measures defining marriage as a union between a man and a woman. The number of Americans who say they have a close friend or family member who is gay, meanwhile, has jumped from 49% in 2010 to 60% today, the first time in CNN polling that a majority of Americans have said that.  In the 1990s, most Americans said they did not know anyone close to them who was gay.  Attitudes about sexual orientation have also changed over that same time period. In 1998, a majority believed that someone who is homosexual could change their sexual orientation if they chose to do so. Today, only a third feel that way, and the number who say that gays cannot change their orientation is almost six in 10. Chick-fil-A executive dies . When it comes to Chick-fil-A, many say Cathy's comments won't sway them one way or another on their fast-food meal of choice. ""No American can say anything these days without someone getting offended. If I don't want my rights of Free Speech taken away, then I'm not going to try to take someone else's rights away,"" said CNN iReporter Byron Thomas of Beaufort, South Carolina. ""Chick-fil-A has done nothing wrong! Chick-fil-A's stance on gay marriage isn't banning anyone from their restaurant or refusing to serve them."" Kim Mitchell, who bypassed protesters in Washington on Thursday to get a bite from the Chick-fil-A food truck, said she supports the chain's overall business model as well as same-sex marriage. ""I believe (Cathy's) employing a lot of young people and he's more of what we need in business today,"" she told CNN affiliate WJLA. Koert Van Ittersum, who teaches brand management to MBA students at Georgia Tech, said the long-term impact of the controversy on Chick-fil-A's bottom line remains to be seen, though he expects it to be ""fairly marginal."" ""It will have an impact -- how big it's going to be is very difficult to say,"" he said. ""There's a group of people out there who support Chick-fil-A because of their values, and this may strengthen that for them ... (but) if people get offended by what other people say, that will have negative implications if it irks people enough and they ... say, 'I'm going to vote with my wallet.'

"New York (CNN)When Sharrif Wilson was released after being wrongfully imprisoned for more than 20 years, he couldn't wait to have a hot slice of New York pizza. ""I feel free. I feel great right now.  I'll able to do things that I [couldn't] do for the last 21 years,"" Wilson told CNN the day after his February 2014 release. His freedom was cut short. Wilson, 38, died Saturday night at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan after suffering from breathing problems and other health issues, less than a year after DNA evidence led to his freedom, according to a statement from his attorney's office. ""They took him away from us. And we finally got him back,"" Fatima Wilson, Sharrif's sister told CNN affiliate WPIX. Wilson was arrested in June 1992, along with his friend Anthony Yarbough, in the slaying of Yarbough's 40-year-old mother, Yarbough's 12-year-old sister and 12-year-old cousin in a Coney Island housing project. Yarbough was just 18, and Wilson only 15, when they were accused of murder. Brooklyn detectives placed Yarbough and Wilson into separate interview rooms and coerced false confessions from the two teens, who were later convicted in separate trials. Yarbough, who was sentenced to 75 years to life in prison, also was released last year. Yarbough's attorney and the district attorney's office began revisiting the case in 2010. In 2013, new DNA evidence from under Yarbough's mother's fingernails matched sperm from the 1999 unsolved rape and murder of Migdalia Ruiz of Brooklyn, according to an investigation by the Medical Examiner's office. Yarbough and Wilson were already incarcerated when the 1999 rape and murder occurred, according to Adam Perlmutter, Wilson's attorney. ""He was a healthy, young, 15-year-old-boy.  And he came out a broken, morbidly obese individual whose health care wasn't really well monitored and maintained by state prison authorities,"" Perlmutter told WPIX. Brooklyn District Attorney Kenneth P. Thompson said his office examined ""newly discovered scientific evidence that was not available at the time of the trial."" ""Based on this new evidence, I believe a jury would have been more likely to return a different verdict,"" Thompson said. DNA frees North Carolina's longest-serving death row resident . Wilson's death recalls the case of William Lopez.  After being wrongfully imprisoned for over 20 years, Lopez passed away at age 55 last September of a massive asthma attack, just days before a scheduled pre-motion conference for his $124 million lawsuit against New York City. He had been out of prison less than two years, said Jeffrey Deskovic, whose foundation had worked with Lopez to help secure his release.

"(CNN)Public transportation in any city almost always attracts an assortment of characters, but a hairy bus rider that roams the aisle on all fours and licks the seats might be a little much for even the most open-minded commuters. But public transit riders in Seattle don't just tolerate Eclipse, a black Labrador-bull mastiff mix -- they've grown to love her. ""All the bus drivers know her,"" passenger Tiona Rainwater told CNN affiliate KOMO.  ""She makes everybody happy.  How could you not love this thing?"" Eclipse started riding the bus to the dog park a couple of years ago with her owner, Jeff Young. Her first solo ride happened after Young paused to smoke a cigarette and couldn't finish in time to board the bus. Eclipse, knowing exactly what to do, hopped on the bus alone. Young caught the next one and the two reunited four stops later at the dog park. The tradition never stopped. For Young, Eclipse's independence isn't really that surprising. ""She's been here the last two years, so she's been urbanized, totally,"" Young said. When local radio host Miles Montgomery saw Eclipse looking for a window seat so she could ""get off at the dog park,"" he couldn't believe it. ""I just look out the window and I'm like, 'Did that just happen?'"" Montgomery told KOMO. Indeed it did, Young said of his friendly companion. ""She's a bus-riding, sidewalk-walking dog,"" Young said.","Eclipse has ridden the bus for two years now .

"(CNN)Domestic assault charges against U.S. women's soccer star Hope Solo were dismissed by a judge in Washington state on Tuesday, her attorney said. ""Today's decision brings closure to what has been one of the most difficult and emotionally draining times of my life,"" Solo said on Facebook. ""I always had faith that once the facts of the case were presented, I would be cleared of all charges, and I am so happy and relieved to finally have it all behind me."" CNN affiliate KOMO reported that attorney Todd Maybrown successfully argued in court that he couldn't depose witnesses for the prosecution because they refused to be questioned despite a court order. Solo, who holds the national team record for most shutouts, didn't appear in court. She was in Carson, California, at the squad's training camp in preparation for the upcoming World Cup. She had faced two counts of fourth-degree domestic violence assault. ""We are gratified that, after considering all of the facts and circumstances of this case, the judge has dismissed all charges,"" Maybrown said in a written statement provided to CNN. ""With a careful review of the facts surrounding these matters, it is clear that Hope never should have faced charges in the first place."" Police had said Solo, 33, assaulted two relatives in June at a home in the Seattle area. Officers responded to a 911 call in which a man reported that a woman would not stop ""hitting people"" or leave the house, a police statement said. At the home, officers heard a disturbance. Inside, Solo appeared ""intoxicated and upset,"" according to police. Police said Solo's nephew and sister had visible injuries. After interviewing witnesses, police believed that Solo was the ""primary aggressor and had instigated the assault,"" the statement said. Solo, a two-time Olympic gold-medal winner, said in a letter to fans a few days later that she was ""confident in the legal process and believe my name will be cleared."" Her attorney denied that Solo had committed any crime, saying she was assaulted and injured in the incident. ""I love my family dearly,"" Solo wrote. ""We, like all families, have our challenges, but my sincere hope is that we are able to resolve this situation as a family. Adversity has always made us stronger, and I know this situation will be no different."" The U.S. women's next match is February 8 in France. The World Cup, hosted by Canada, begins in June. She also plays for the Seattle Reign of the National Women's Soccer League, which begins its season in April. Solo also played on World Cup teams in 2007 and 2011, and appeared on ABC's ""Dancing With the Stars."" In 2012, Solo sent out a harsh tweet criticizing Olympic soccer commentator Brandi Chastain for her negative commentary during the 2012 London games. During the 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup, Solo openly criticized U.S. women's soccer coach Greg Ryan after she was benched and the U.S. lost its next match by four goals. In an interview with CNN two years ago, Solo spoke about her public image. ""I have a bad rap,"" she said. ""People look at me as selfish, outspoken. But I know who I am."" The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency in 2012 publicly warned Solo after she tested positive for a banned diuretic -- a substance she claimed she didn't know was in premenstrual medication prescribed by her physician. The agency accepted Solo's explanation, and she competed in the 2012 Olympics. ""I don't expect any of the media to be positive,"" Solo told CNN in 2012. ""But I know that I'm doing wonderful things for the sport of soccer, and I know I'm doing amazing things for female athletes. So I can take it."" Solo was eliminated from ""Dancing With the Stars"" in 2011 following a run on the show marred by frequent disputes with pro partner Maksim Chmerkovskiy and the judging panel.

"(CNN) -- World soccer's governing body FIFA have confirmed that vice president Jack Warner has resigned from his position within the organization. Last month Trinidadian Warner, along with fellow-FIFA member Mohammed bin Hammam, were provisionally suspended by FIFA's Ethics Committee, pending the outcome of an investigation of corruption allegations against them. But, following 68-year-old Warner's resignation, that investigation will now not take place. A FIFA statement read: ""His resignation has been accepted and his contribution to international football and to Caribbean football in particular are appreciated and acknowledged. ""Mr Warner is leaving FIFA by his own volition after nearly 30 years of service, having chosen to focus on his important work on behalf of the people and government of Trinidad & Tobago as a cabinet minister and as the chairman of the United National Congress, the major party in his country's coalition government. ""The FIFA Executive Committee, the FIFA president and the FIFA management thank Mr Warner for his services to Caribbean and international football over his many years devoted to football at both regional and international level, and wish him well for the future. ""As a consequence of Mr Warner's self-determined resignation, all Ethics Committee procedures against him have been closed and the presumption of innocence is maintained,"" the statement continued. Warner, the head of the Caribbean, North and Central American Federation (CONCACAF), and Asian football chief bin Hammam, were suspended after allegations that cash gifts of $40,000 were offered to the heads of CONCACAF's national associations in an attempt to defeat FIFA supremo Sepp Blatter in the presidential election earlier this month. Chuck Blazer, general secretary of CONCACAF, reported possible misdeeds during the May 10 and 11 conference in Trinidad. Blatter was subsequently elected unopposed for a fourth term as president and Warner and bin Hammam were suspended while an investigation into the claims continued.","Jack Warner has resigned from his position as FIFA vice president .

"Acting VA Secretary Sloan Gibson said he is frustrated and expects to have a plan in place to take ""personnel actions"" against employees responsible for manipulating patient wait lists at one VA medical center by the end of this week.  He wouldn't identify the location of the center, but said it is not the Phoenix facility that has been at the epicenter of a wait-list scandal. Gibson, the top official of the Department of Veterans Affairs, said the investigation process ""takes a long time. And nobody is more frustrated about that than I am."" He added that investigators at the Office of Inspector General are on the ground at more than 70 locations, and he needs to wait for each investigation to be complete before anyone can be fired. The investigations came after months of CNN reports on deadly delays for veterans waiting for care at VA hospitals. Gibson was put in place temporarily after the ensuing firestorm forced the resignation of the former VA secretary, Eric Shinseki. Gibson said he believes the behavior of VA employees has begun to change across the nation, but he wants to hold accountable the individuals responsible for fraudulent practices as soon as possible. ""Until people actually see those consequences I think they still don't trust it's a serious thing,"" Gibson said. ""I want to set the tone."" Gibson spoke to CNN outside a hearing before the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs on Wednesday; the acting secretary described an ongoing culture within the VA of faulty scheduling, long wait times, retaliation against whistle-blowers and lack of accountability for the leaders who have perpetuated these issues.  In order to curb these failures, Gibson requested $17.6 billion over the next three years to hire 10,000 doctors and medical providers, pay for private health care appointments and increase the agency's infrastructure to meet veterans' needs. ""I believe in as little as two years, the conversation can change,"" Gibson said, indicating his confidence that his proposed solutions can transform the VA. About $10 billion of the requested funds would cover the costs of additional VA staff and private care for veterans while about $6 billion would pay for new clinics and medical space, Gibson said. Sen. Mike Johanns, R-Nebraska, challenged Gibson's request for additional funds, however, noting that Congress repeatedly approved more money at the request of former VA Secretary Eric Shinseki in years past, yet the backlog of appointments persisted. Highlighting the severity of the issues, the committee's chairman, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, said more than 600,000 veterans are still waiting at least a month for appointments and about 8,000 are waiting at least four months. ""What are the legitimate needs? What are the real needs facing the 22 million veterans in this country?"" Sanders asked. ""We have an immediate crisis."" The Veterans Health Administration has reached out to more than 160,000 veterans to get them off wait lists and into medical centers, Gibson said, but he added that the VA needs to take drastic steps to restore trust with veterans and the American public at large. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut, said he has called for a criminal investigation by the Department of Justice into allegations that VA leaders intentionally manipulated patients' appointments. ""I do think that criminal responsibility has to be applied if there was ... destruction of documents, fraud in reporting,"" Blumenthal said. Gibson told senators on Wednesday that he will not tolerate retaliation against whistle-blowers, but a panel of VA employees told the House Committee on Veterans Affairs last week that the threat of retaliation continues to silence individuals who have knowledge of wrongdoing. After Shinseki's resignation, President Obama nominated the former chief executive of Procter & Gamble Co. and West Point graduate, Bob McDonald, to lead the VA. McDonald will face a Senate confirmation hearing next week.","Workers responsible for manipulating patient wait lists at one center face action .

The allegations were ""republished by countless media outlets around the world, thus further perpetuating the untrue depiction of Oberst as a rapist,"" said a defamation lawsuit filed by Oberst against Faircloth in February.  ""To add insult to injury, certain media outlets published stories in which Faircloth's defamatory false statements were characterized as true, and in which Oberst's fans were actually encouraged to stop supporting his musical career.""

"(CNN) -- A 32-year-old Saudi Arabian who has crusaded for women to drive in her country said she was stopped Saturday for driving a car -- even though there is no law against it. Manal al Sharif, a mother of a 5-year-old boy, told CNN authorities released her and then tried to detain her again early Sunday. Al Sharif, one of those behind Women2Drive, claimed traffic and religious police detained her for six hours Saturday after they spotted her driving in Khobar. She said she was forced to sign a form promising not to drive again, and then was allowed to go home. She told CNN that lawyers are trying to stop police from detaining her for a second time. A Women2Drive tweet later indicated al Sharif and her brother had been taken from their Khobar residence to a police station. CNN was trying to reach Saudi authorities for comment. Women2Drive is an initiative endorsing the right of women to drive and travel freely in Saudi Arabia. While there are no traffic laws that make it illegal for women to drive in Saudi Arabia, religious edicts are often interpreted as a ban on female drivers. Hundreds of women have joined the campaign on Facebook and Twitter to begin driving June 17. Some women, such as Al Sharif, with international licenses began driving earlier. Al Sharif recently told CNN, ""We are not doing anything that is breaking the law."" Strict segregation by sex means women in Saudi Arabia can't travel without a male relative. They can't take public transport. To get around, women hire expensive drivers or taxis. Al Sharif became frustrated after she had difficulty going home one evening. ""I had to walk on the street for half an hour looking for a cab. I was harassed by every single car because it was late at night and I was walking alone,"" she told CNN. ""I kept calling my brother to pick me up but his phone wasn't answering. I was crying in the street. A 32-year-old grown woman, a mother, crying like a kid because I couldn't find anyone to bring me home."" Al Sharif, who has taught other women how to drive, is resolute about Saudi women being more outspoken. ""We have a saying,"" she told CNN. ""The rain starts with a single drop.

"Six men have been arrested in connection with the shooting of Malala Yousufzai, the teenage activist who spoke out against the Taliban, but the main suspect remained at large, Pakistani police said Wednesday. Police identified Atta Ullah Khan, a 23-year-old man from the Swat district where Malala was attacked, as the primary suspect. Police said they were searching for Khan, who was studying for a master's degree in chemistry. The Swat Valley in northwestern Pakistan is a Taliban redoubt. In addition to arresting six men -- all of them from Swat -- police have detained Khan's mother, brother and fiancee. The suspect's relatives were not accused of involvement but are being questioned, a senior police official told CNN. The official did not say what role Khan may have played. Khan had studied for a Bachelor of Science degree in physics at Jahanzeb College in Swat. Alam Zeb, the school's principal, said Khan had given school officials three or four dates of birth. Zeb condemned the attack and said he was surprised to hear that a former student may have been involved. The 15-year-old girl, who has become a symbol of courage after being shot in the head by the Taliban for demanding education for girls, is being treated at a hospital in Birmingham, England. On Wednesday, she remained in stable condition and ""continues to make good progress,"" the hospital's website said. She is expected to need ""a significant period of rest and recuperation"" before undergoing reconstructive surgery, Dr. Dave Rosser, medical director of University Hospitals Birmingham, said last week. Malala was fighting an infection, but was able to move her extremities and has stood with help from nurses, the hospital said. Malala's family remains in Pakistan. Malala can't speak because a tube has been inserted into her trachea to protect her airway, which was swollen after her gunshot injury, but she was writing coherent sentences, Rosser said. The Pakistani Taliban have claimed responsibility for the October 9 shooting and vowed to kill Malala, if she recovers.","Six arrests are made in the shooting of Malala Yousufzai .

"(CNN)Does Islam have anything to do with the terrorist atrocities in Paris last week? The short, uncomfortable, answer is: Of course it does. Consider the choice of targets of the terrorists: A magazine that in the terrorists' minds had insulted the Prophet Mohammed. Before they died on Friday, one of the Kouachi brothers who carried out the attack on the Charlie Hebdo magazine spoke on the phone to a French journalist, saying, ""We are just telling you that we are the defenders of Prophet Mohammed."" Consider that the other target of the terrorists was a kosher store serving Jews. Virulent anti-Semitism   is, of course, a staple of militant Islamist ideology. Militants can point to the Quranic verse, ""O believers, take not Jews and Christians as friends,"" as religious ""proof"" for this position. Consider also that the three terrorists believed in their own minds that they were holy warriors who would die ""martyred"" in their holy war and that they would live on in Paradise. One of the terrorists, Cherif Kouachi, planned to fight in the Iraq War against the Americans but was detained by French authorities in 2005 before could execute his plan. Kouachi told French investigators that ""the wise leaders in Islam told him and his friends that if they die as martyrs in jihad they would go to heaven"" and ""that martyrs would be greeted by more than 60 virgins in a big palace in heaven."" This refers to the hadith, or saying of the Prophet Mohammed, that martyrs will enjoy the favor of 72 virgins. Before he was killed, another of the terrorists, Amedy Coulibaly, recorded a ""martyrdom"" video in which pledged his allegiance to the leader of ISIS. In the video he said, ""I am firstly addressing the caliph of the Muslims Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. ... I pledged allegiance to the Caliph as soon as the caliphate was declared."" This statement refers to the belief that a Muslim caliphate, or empire, will stretch across the Muslim world and will be led by a caliph, who is the political and religious successor of the Prophet Mohammed. The fact that the Paris attacks have something to do with Islamic beliefs cannot be wished away either by claims that Islam is simply a religion of peace, or by political correctness, or because we live in an increasingly secularized modern era that often doesn't take deeply held religious beliefs sufficiently seriously. (Nor, of course, does it mean that Muslims who reject fanatical beliefs bear any kind of responsibility for what happened in Paris, as Rupert Murdoch suggested in a much-criticized tweet, or have a particular obligation to do something to fight extremism.) The reason that Islamist militants can assert that jihad is necessary against the perceived enemies of Islam is that there is sufficient ammunition in the Quran to buttress their beliefs.  The same could also, of course, be said for the Old Testament, which is full of scenes of violent death visited on the enemies of God. And it is also the case that only a tiny minority of Muslims are willing to do violence in the name of Allah. Nonetheless, a well-known verse in the Quran, which for believers is literally the Word of God, commands Muslims that they ""fight and slay the nonbelievers wherever you find them, seize them, beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them in every stratagem [of war]."" The same verse adds that if the nonbelievers ""repent"" and pay what is rendered in some translations of the Quran as charity to the poor and in others as a tax to Muslims, then they can be spared. Indeed, when Osama bin Laden made a formal declaration of war against ""the Jews and the Crusaders"" in 1998, he cited this Quranic verse at the beginning of his declaration. Assertions, therefore, that Islamist terrorism has nothing to do with Islam are as nonsensical as claims that the Crusades had nothing to do with Christian beliefs about the sanctity of Jerusalem or that the exponential growth of Israeli settlements on Palestinian lands are not rooted in the beliefs of certain fundamentalist Jewish groups about the God-given rights of Jews to live in their God-given homeland. After Paris attacks, seven questions being asked about Islam . Indeed, there is an explicitly religious civil war driven by terrorist groups such as ISIS, al Qaeda and Hezbollah unfolding in the Middle East in countries such as Iraq, Syria and Yemen that pits ultrafundamentalist Sunnis against ultrafundamentalist Shias. This war could well replicate the religious Thirty Years' War that tore apart 17th century Europe in both viciousness and length. Already hundreds of thousands have died in these conflicts. Elements in the Gulf Arab states and Iran have helped to foment this regional civil war. Certain Gulf Arabs support proxy jihadist Sunni groups such as al Qaeda's affiliate in Syria, while Iran supports Shia militant forces such as Hezbollah. Islam is, to be sure, a big tent and the one and a half billion Muslims in the world run the gamut from mystical, moderate, pacific Sufis to Salafists. Salafism is an ultrafundmentalist branch of Islam that is particularly prevalent in Saudi Arabia. Salafism is intolerant of what its adherents consider to be Islamic deviancy such as Shia Islam, as well as of other religions such as Judaism or Christianity, and it offers scant roles for women outside the home. Salafism is not, however, a gateway to violence for the tens of millions of its peaceful adherents around the world. That said, while very few Salafists are terrorists, jihadist terrorists are almost invariably Salafists. A similar point could also be made about Christian fundamentalists in the United States: Very few kill abortion clinic doctors, but anyone who kills an abortion clinic doctor in the States is almost invariably a Christian fundamentalist. For terrorists such as those who carried out the attacks in Paris last week, their Salafism also became increasingly politicized. To boil it down, they adopted the ideology of what can be termed ""Binladenism,"" as it was Osama bin Laden who laid out this ideology for a global audience in a series of interviews and statements he made before he was killed in 2011. Before we get into an explanation of this ideology, it might be helpful to explore what an ideology is: It is an idea or set of ideas that claims to fully explain the world and, often, history itself. Examples of such ideologies might include Marxist-Leninism, which claimed that history could only be understood in material terms as a class struggle between the capitalists and the workers. Another such ideology was Nazism, which asserted that the German/Aryan race's rightful, dominant place in the world could only be attained by the enslavement or elimination of supposedly inferior ethnic groups, particularly Jews. Ideologies, by their nature, are not susceptible to challenges posed by countervailing evidence. Whether they are secular (Marxist-Leninism) or they are religious, they are fundamentally theological in the sense they are belief systems that are not open to question or scientific inquiry. You either believe. Or you don't. Common to many ideologies is the belief that history has a direction and a purpose and that at the end of this history, the world will be transformed into a utopia. In Marxist-Leninism's case, this utopia was the classless society of true communism, and for Nazism, it was the Thousand Year Reich. In the minds of the true believers, the only possible explanation for why these nirvanas haven't been attained as yet is that a pesky set of enemies are standing in the way. Since such groups are blocking the creation of utopia, they are not simply just obtuse, they are, in fact, evil and therefore must be exterminated. This belief explains both Stalin's campaign to murder millions of Russians who were purported to be counterrevolutionaries as well as Hitler's Holocaust. Similarly, the ideology of Binladenism is the belief that the world will finally be made perfect after the restoration of a Taliban-style Caliphate that will stretch across the Muslim world from Indonesia to Morocco. Its supporters brand as evil the people and nations that they perceive are standing in the way of this dream, including Jews, Israel, any Middle Eastern regime that doesn't follow Taliban-style rule, the United States and its Western allies such as France. In bin Laden's telling, there was a global conspiracy by the West and its puppet allies in the Muslim world to destroy true Islam, and this conspiracy is led by the United States. Religious-based moral outrage about Western foreign policy in the Muslim world -- a key tenet of the ideology of Binladenism -- is a recurring theme that crops up with many militant Islamist militants. The Paris terrorists shared in this. One of the terrorists,  Amedy Coulibaly, recorded a video before he died, saying that the bombing of ISIS positions in Syria and Iraq by Western countries had motivated his attacks: ""If you attack the Islamic State, we will attack you. ... You and your coalition, you bombarded regularly over there."" For the Paris terrorists, as it was for bin Laden, the only answer to the purported Western assaults on Islam is revenge. That explains 9/11, and it also explains the terrorist attacks in Paris last week. To claim that these attacks had nothing to do with a number of Islamic beliefs -- albeit cherrypicked -- is preposterous.","Peter Bergen: Debate rages about whether attacks have anything to do with Islam .

"(CNN)Sixteen hours in the ocean, for a trained swimmer -- with an escort boat and all kinds of safety precautions nearby, plenty of water and electrolyte drinks and nutrition at hand -- is a long, grueling session. When I was training for my Cuba-Florida Swim, yes, the 10- and 12- and 14- hour practice swims were tough enough, depending on the day's wave action. But when we got into the 15-, 16-, 17-, 18-hour sessions, we well knew we were going to be under duress. The concentration, the perseverance, the physical stamina required for that length of time in the sea is formidable. But for an untrained swimmer, absolutely alone, immersed in a liquid some 25 degrees under normal body temperature, 16 hours is a survival test many might not pass. A less courageous soul might quickly succumb to the hypothermia, the unknown, the salt exposure, the adrenaline spike when face-to-face with a circling shark. Rob Konrad's history as a tough NFL player, to my mind, prepared him for this harrowing journey after he fell off his boat Wednesday into the Atlantic Ocean, nine miles off the South Florida coast. He said he swam  to shore, was circled by a shark and stung by jellyfish, all while knowing he might not survive. But he did. And it's almost as if his entire life got him ready to save his own life out there. First, he had two choices. One was to conserve energy, tread water, and wait for a boat or even a plane to spot him. Instead he took action. People have drowned when they've made the mistake of keeping their clothing on after a boating accident or plane crash leaves them in the water. They think they'll stay warm longer that way. But Konrad knew he needed to shed everything but his underwear to be able to move. He used the sun's position, knowing he had to swim west, by day. And he tried to move toward the shore lights at night. A pro football player knows pain. They say for an NFL player each game is akin to putting the body through 35 car collisions. Most of those players, come Monday, hobble around with aches and deep bone bruises and ripped ligaments, and worse. A pro football player also knows a long, exhausting season. He needs fortitude for the long haul. He is accustomed to gritting his teeth and enduring discomfort in the moment, with an eye toward the many weeks to come. Konrad called on his athlete self to set his will and bear down on his goal: survival. It brought tears to my eyes when he talked about picturing his two children as angels on his shoulders to motivate him. I remember Vietnam War POW survivor Jerry Coffee, who suffered unspeakable pain, wrenched into a box the size of a coffin for seven unimaginable years. Jerry pictured his family. He vowed he would see them one day again. Rob Konrad did the same. You might think it's a blessing to go overboard in salt water, which allows more natural buoyancy, rather than in fresh water. But any marathon swimmer will tell you that the little flotation you get from salt water is not worth the sickness that comes when you take in gulps of the sea, not worth the salt exposure to the mouth and face, and certainly not worth the encounters with creatures. You'd prefer a freshwater lake any day. Konrad said a shark circled him at one point. It's alarming how quickly word gets out in the shark universe that there's a man overboard. They show up almost immediately when a swimmer is dangling, no rescue boat in sight. Konrad may not have known that, if you can summon the moxie, the right move is a swift,  aggressive  punch to the shark's sensitive snout. But it seems Rob's particular shark wasn't starving. We are told by shark experts that humans are not normal shark food. And Rob was close enough to shore that there were likely plenty of reef fish that already kept the sharks well-fed. Had he been 50 or 60 miles off shore, it could have been a different story: There, a shark may not have eaten in a week or two, and a splashing swimmer would be highly enticing. But all of these considerations are intellectual hogwash when you're out there totally on your own and a fin is doing figure eights around you. Konrad's shark left him after a while. Another stranded soul might have panicked; he stayed calm. Konrad was suffering from hypothermia by the time he touched land. The water temperatures he swam through were about 73 degrees Fahrenheit. True, one has a better chance of surviving 16 hours in those temperatures than in the North Sea, for example, but 73 is nevertheless way below 98.6. To go through the night, untrained, especially given his dense musculature, ideal neither for flotation nor endurance, meant he was going to start feeling cold, which he did. No, Rob Konrad wasn't a long-distance swimmer, stroking a powerful freestyle, keeping his metabolic rate up, reaching up for water and food from a handler every half-hour. Rob Konrad was a tough guy, versed in grit and bravery from his football days, determined to outlast the elements, no matter how long it took. We should all honor your courage, Rob. And we know what else helped you make it to shore. You are, after all, a Dolphin.","Diana Nyad: Ex-NFL player who swam 16 hours to safety showed smarts, determination, courage .

"(CNN)Professional climbers Tommy Caldwell and Kevin Jorgeson may be hours away from reaching a new height: the top of El Capitan in Yosemite National Park. Since December 27, Caldwell and Jorgeson have been scaling the 3,000-foot rock formation. Now, it appears the duo will reach the summit on Wednesday or Thursday. The route Caldwell and Jorgenson are attempting is the notoriously difficult Dawn Wall, more than a half mile high. There are many routes up El Capitan, but only a handful have been attempted by climbers trying to free climb -- using only their hands and feet -- with ropes designed only to catch them when they fall. And none have successfully conquered El Capitan's Dawn Wall. Perhaps no route is more challenging than the Dawn Wall, which offers few footholds and may be the most difficult climb in the world. If they succeed, Caldwell and Jorgeson would be the first to successfully free-climb the Dawn Wall, Yosemite National Park officials confirmed. For Caldwell, it's a dream that has been in the making for several years.  An accomplished climber, Caldwell already completed five other routes on El Capitan, according to his bio. But family members say the Dawn Wall route is one that has consumed him. ""He was looking for more of a challenge"" said Caldwell's father Mike. ""He started going up and repelling down and trying to see if he could see holds that could turn into a climb. Over a two-year period, he probably spent 25-30 days on the wall just looking it over."" Jorgeson, who started climbing competitively as a teenager, didn't know Caldwell until he decided to join him on the climb. ""Kevin called Tommy offering to help with the climb and that's how they met,"" Mike Caldwell said. The team attempted an earlier push on the project several years ago, but were shut down due to weather, according to Caldwell's Facebook page. The anticipation of completing the climb is generating excitement, with family members headed to the mountain. Tommy Caldwell's wife left Colorado Monday headed to Yosemite, and Caldwell's parents are heading that way Tuesday. The climbers, meanwhile, have expressed the adventure's joys and heartaches through various social media accounts.

"Facebook's decision to file for public status means its No. 2 executive, Sheryl Sandberg, might be worth as much as $1.6 billion. According to Forbes, that would catapult her just below the seemingly untouchable Oprah in the ranking of the richest self-made women. She won't have much company: Only 7.5% of the major earners at America's Fortune 500 companies are female. The many media profiles of Sandberg all seem to be asking the same question: How did Sheryl do it? How did she get the confidence to perform so well at such a high level? And perform she has. According to The New York Times, she took Facebook from 70 million users and no business model to profits reaching $1 billion on $3.7 billion in revenue in just four years. Sandberg's own mentor, Larry Summers, ignited a firestorm in 2005 when he wondered publicly whether one reason women weren't achieving at the highest levels in the sciences was a lack of biological aptitude, particularly for math. Before long, he was ousted from his position as president of Harvard -- not officially for this reason -- and the nation was abuzz about women's lack of parity in so many fields and forums. At that time, about 15% of opinion pieces were written by women, though the imbalance was largely under the radar. The opinion page became a particularly contentious space for an outpouring of women's voices in this overdue conversation. Nationally syndicated columnist Susan Estrich called The Los Angeles Times' leadership out for sexism on its opinion pages. Anne Applebaum of The Washington Post argued with Estrich and said she resented being called a ""female"" journalist. And Maureen Dowd of The New York Times, echoing one of the most commonly held beliefs about why women don't have parity, wrote that women weren't fairly represented because they are afraid of being attacked and care too much about what others think. They lack confidence. But what does that really mean? The notion that women lack confidence implies a negative judgment. It's viewed as a weakness, coded as feminine. But some recent social science research reveals a more likely and complex explanation: People do things because people who look and talk like them or share the same background do those things. To assume that a lack of confidence is the reason so few women are intellectual leaders is too simplistic. When a woman doesn't go for a big corporate job like Sandberg's or says no when television producers call, saying she doesn't have any confidence implies it's an individual choice made in some sort of sociocultural vacuum. As women, in many cases, the impulse to do something out of the norm of our peer group, like write an opinion piece or ask for a promotion, has simply never occurred to us. If it does, we don't act on it. Our girlfriends aren't doing it. Our female colleagues aren't doing it. Why should we? Peer influence, whether you're a teenage girl trying to figure out what to wear to junior high on Monday morning or a midlevel manager at Morgan Stanley, is a powerful indicator of what you think is possible for yourself. In ""Join the Club: How Peer Pressure Can Transform the World,"" Tina Rosenberg writes, ""The social norms set by our peers dominate our choices about what we value and what we expect in life."" Sandberg, who often urges women to ""lean into"" their careers, must know that you don't lean in alone. She runs a monthly salon for women out of her home, inviting guest speakers like feminist Gloria Steinem and trailblazing Sen. Claire McCaskill. Women of various generations gather and shape their ambitions over a meal and some conversation. At The OpEd Project, we cultivate new voices, training minorities and women to inhabit their place as narrators of the world. The challenge is to shift the way we think about ourselves. We must see our peers and ourselves as leaders who have a right and a responsibility to weigh in on the matters of our day. We have to create a new ecosystem in which we see ourselves as part of the critical conversations of our age and feel equally entitled and compelled to narrate them. Who hasn't heard a parent quip, ""If all of your friends were jumping off of a cliff, would you?"" There's some profound wisdom in that old cliché: If your friends aren't aiming for high-profile corporate leadership or going head-to-head on the Sunday morning talk shows, you're not likely to, either. We can create more Sandbergs by surrounding ourselves with confident, outspoken women. Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter.

"(CNN)It was almost 5 p.m. on a Tuesday, and 18-year-old Woodline Kethura Robuste was doing her homework, researching Voltaire at a Port-au-Prince cybercafe. Meanwhile, Kencia Marseille, 29, had returned home from a day at Alliance Universite -- where she studied information technology -- and was chatting with a friend. That's when everything started to shake. Violently. While Kethura was able to run out, unscarred, she lost her uncle and her house was destroyed. Kencia was injured when falling debris struck and broke her hip. Luckily, everyone else in her family survived unhurt. It's been five years since a January afternoon in Haiti was interrupted by a devastating earthquake that instantly changed millions of lives and everyone still remembers the day vividly. It is estimated that the earthquake took the lives of more than 230,000 people. Five years after the quake: Haiti at a crossroads . But since 2012, these two women -- along with 20 others -- have also shared a different experience. In the outskirts of South Bend, Indiana, a town where sports usually means Notre Dame football, 22 Haitian and Haitian-American women live in two small apartments and work hard to achieve one big dream: They strive to win soccer glory wearing the colors of the Haiti National Women's Soccer Team under the guide of Polish-born coach Shek Borkowski. To open their doors is to enter another world where Creole mixes with English and French in the hallway of an apartment kept at tropical warmth. Fragrant rice, beans and bananes cook on the stove top. Socks, shorts and jerseys are in the washing machine; bright cleats are strewn in room corners. They come from Port-au-Prince, the capital, as well as Leogane, Cap Haitien and Petit Goave. Some played with local teams, with unclear prospects for a future in the sport. Their stories are those of struggle and of love for a game they played despite mothers' warnings, admonitions or disapproval. Kencia, now 33, is the only one of her 16 siblings who plays the sport. ""My mother, she didn't accept me playing soccer, she thought that soccer is only for men, but I like soccer since I was young. I always liked to play, even though she beat me, even though I had to hide to play,"" she recalls. Kencia, the team captain until this season, was one of the first players recruited by Borkowski. While living in Port-au-Prince, she played with the Aigle Brilliant and was told about the team that the coach was assembling. She didn't think twice about making the leap. ""I was really happy because my objective for a long time was to play in another country,"" she says. Charities continue to help in Haiti's recovery . What was the hardest thing about coming to the United States? The cold, she says, as she digs deeper into the pockets of a blue sports jacket with the seal of the Haiti Soccer. For the players, being part of the team also means sacrifices. None of them gets paid or gets perks. Kethura -- or Kethu as she's affectionately known -- lost her father last year in the midst of the World Cup qualifier matches season. The Haitian Soccer Federation offered to cover a one-way ticket to Haiti with a much later return flight. She decided to stay and play with the team. ""Soccer helps me forget the pain. I don't think of anything,"" says soft-spoken Kethura, who is now 22 and also serves as the team translator. Her first soccer memory was a gift from her father. ""I was 7 or 8 years old when I got my first cleats, from my father. I always played with the other kids but barefoot. One day he decided to buy me new cleats,"" she recalls. ""My father always talked to me about soccer because he loved the game, and he wanted me to play soccer and become a great football (player)."" The team has brought together players from all backgrounds, sharing Haitian roots and soccer dreams. Shanna Hudson lives in Southern California, where she played for the LA Blues before the team folded. She came to play for Borkowski after hearing he needed players. With perfect English and ""so-so"" Creole, she says her grandparents came from Haiti. Samantha Brand also lives and trains in California, where she met fellow teammate Kim Boulos, a blond, green-eyed player of Haitian descent. They quickly reported to Borkowski to join the team when it all began in 2012. Princeton janitor brings clean water to hometown in Haiti . ""It's our shot at glory,"" Kim says with a broad smile. Samantha proudly shows a video of the sub-11 girls team she coaches back home in San Francisco. For Samantha -- for them all -- it's all about building a future for women in the sport. ""I think it's really important for females like us to be coaches. My club right now is supporting me through this entire thing because they realize that young females don't have enough female professional soccer players that are tangible to them, and so I think it's really a big responsibility for us to turn around and give back to the youth,"" she says. At the helm of this squad is Shek Borkowski, an established soccer coach who took FC Indiana, in the Women's Premiere Soccer League, to two consecutive championships in 2007 and 2008 and Russian club Zvezda to a Supreme League title in the 2009-2010 season. Borkowski was offered the coaching position, and after watching Haiti play in the London Olympics, he decided to take on the challenge and aimed to help the team become the first Caribbean nation to play at the 2015 Women's World Cup. Borkowski met with Haitian Soccer Federation President Yves Jean-Bart. ""President Jean Bart was very upfront with me; he shared the challenges that the federation faced so I just knew from day one."" With limited funds from the Federation -- just enough to cover the travel between Haiti and the United States -- Borkowski brought the team to the South Bend, Indiana. ""The soccer culture in Haiti is such where if a boy plays soccer, there's clear opportunities for that boy to turn professional. So the family understands that, and they will allow the boy to play and practice. ""With girls, there [are] simply no opportunities available, so it's not being taken serious,"" says Borkowski. ""For families, it's difficult to understand why a girl should be practicing twice a day because there is no end game,"" he adds. ""The only way to take a step forward was to bring them to a controlled environment. It was critical for us to get them out of Haiti and bring them to the United States,"" he says. In South Bend, Borkowski incorporated part of the squad to the FC Indiana team and uses the college soccer season as preparation for the team and practice for tournaments. He also established a nonprofit organization -- IWOF for International Women's Opportunity Foundation -- to raise funds for the team. They regularly do soccer camps and fundraising events to cover their costs. ""We're typically three months behind on rent payments because the money we bring in comes in the summer months,"" says Borkowski. ""This is pretty stressful for players."" Everything from their uniforms and cleats to the gear and the coaching staff's time is donated. ""All of our positions are voluntary, in that we do not receive any type of salary"" says Kristin Eggert, the team's assistant coach and a former soccer player. The squad aimed to change their fate by qualifying for the 2015 Women's World Cup in Canada. The qualifying tournament held over the summer across the Caribbean and several U.S. cities helped them gain notoriety, particularly after the cash-strapped team came to aid its counterparts from Trinidad and Tobago, coached by Randy Waldrum. ""His team arrived in Dallas with 500 dollars and no transportation from the airport. Randy Waldrum is a former coach for the University of Notre Dame; he's helped us in terms of development and so when this happened to his team, it was just a natural reaction that we have to help as well,"" Borkowski said. Their gesture went viral in the Twittersphere, many pledged support to the Haitian team. Among them, TOMS shoes donated sports gear, and the Clinton Foundation reached out to inquire about the team's needs. Borkowski says substantive aid still needs to materialize. But after a very exciting season of matches against Caribbean countries and bigger teams such as USA, Mexico and Costa Rica, Haiti was unable to win the three matches needed to secure a spot to the World Cup. For Borkowski, it's back to the drawing board. ""We are at a crossroad,"" he says. ""We don't know how we're going to approach preparation this year."" For some players, this was the end of the road. Captain Kencia Marseille and other players return to Haiti, to go on with the lives they paused in the name of the sport. Roughly half of the players that came from Haiti will remain in the team and a new crop will join the national squad as well as the U-17 and U-20 teams, all coached by Borkowski. Qualifying matches for the two spots available to the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Football Associations for the 2016 Olympics starts this coming fall. The players' dreams live on.","The worlds of Woodline Kethura Robuste and Kencia Marseille imploded five years ago .

"Another Sherpa guide has died in Friday's Mount Everest avalanche, bringing the death toll to 13, a Nepalese government official said Saturday. It is the single deadliest accident on Mount Everest, officials said. Three others are missing, said Madhu Sudan Burlakoti of Nepal's Tourism Ministry, and at least half a dozen are injured. A group of about 50 people, mostly Nepali Sherpas, were hit by the avalanche at more than 20,000 feet, said Tilak Ram Pandey of the ministry's mountaineering department. The avalanche took place just above base camp in the Khumbu Ice Fall. Climbers and guides had been setting the ropes for the route, acclimating and preparing the camps along the route when the avalanche hit Friday, said Gordon Janow with Alpine Ascents International in Seattle. All 50 to 60 climbers were Nepalese locals and Sherpas who were taking food and supplies to the camps, Pandey said. The climbers are all now accounted for, Pandey said. ""Rescue teams have gone ... to look for the missing."" 'I did not think I would survive' One of those who survived is Wangdi Sherpa, 26, who was working with trekking firm Summit Treks to take 13 Britons to climb Everest. He recounted how he and others were going to set up Camp II, above base camp, when disaster struck -- and it was only by chance that he was not among the victims. ""A big piece of ice suddenly came off the mountain. I did not think I would survive. I am very happy to have survived,"" said Wangdi, who has reached the mountain's summit three times before. He and an assistant, who were attached to a safety rope, hid behind a piece of ice as the avalanche came tumbling down, he said. ""We could do that because we were in the front,"" he said. ""Up to 12 of those behind us survived, but the ones after them died. Those who had already crossed ahead when the ice came off also survived. ""We stayed behind the ice for five minutes. By the time we reached base camp it was around 11 a.m. When the ice fell we saw nothing because of the dust,"" Wangdi said. 'There is always a risk of death' This latest accident occurred during the spring climbing season, the busiest of the year. Climbers arrive in April to acclimate to the altitude before heading toward the summit of the world's highest mountain. Ethnic Sherpas act as guides for the mostly foreign clients. Now the question is whether the planned expedition will go ahead in the wake of Friday's tragedy. ""The Sherpas and the clients are not in a condition to talk to each other at the moment,"" said Jeewan Ghimire, of Shangri La Treks. Four of his Sherpas are dead after the avalanche and one is missing. ""It could take a week more before a decision on whether the climb will go ahead will be taken,"" he said. According to Ghimire, ""A distance is being maintained between the two sides. The clients will have to accept the decision of the Sherpas."" ""Our friends and brothers have died. There will be no question of doing anything without a discussion with everyone involved,"" said Pasang Sherpa, who also has been to Everest before. ""This is our job, so there is always a risk of death. We cannot say that there has been exploitation."" About 334 foreign climbers have been given permission to climb Everest over the next couple of months, with an estimated 400 Sherpas helping them, mountaineering official Dipendra Poudel said Friday. From May 15 to 30 is usually the best window for reaching the 29,028-foot peak. Lakpa Sherpa, who has twice reached the summit of Everest, lost his cousin Ang Kaji Sherpa on the mountain on Friday. Despite that loss, he said safety standards have improved by 80% on what they were 10 years ago, because the Sherpas are better trained. He added, ""There is always a risk in this job."" The deadliest year was in 1996 . Before Friday, the deadliest single-day toll was from an accident in May 1996, when eight climbers disappeared when a huge storm hit. Their tragic story was chronicled in Jon Krakauer's bestselling book ""Into Thin Air."" The deadliest year on Everest was 1996, when 15 people died. Another 12 climbers were killed in 2006. Until the late 1970s, only a handful of climbers reached the top each year. The number topped 100 for the first time in 1993. By 2004, it was more than 300. In 2012, the number was more than 500.

"Washington (CNN)Washington's commuters will face delays Tuesday morning following a deadly incident on the capital's subway train system. One passenger died after smoke filled the L'Enfant Plaza metro station Monday afternoon, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority said. A total of 84 people were taken to hospitals. The National Transportation and Safety Board released a statement saying ""an electrical arcing event"" sparked the incident. ""There was an electrical arcing event involving the trackside power cables (the third rail),"" said a statement from the NTSB's Peter Knudson. A six-car Yellow line train was southbound from L'Enfant station when sparks were noticed about 1,100 feet in front of the train as the tunnel filed with smoke. ""Passengers on the train self-evacuated.,"" Knudson said.  ""The train did not derail.  There was no fire on the train."" The smoke was thick enough to prompt WMATA to suspend service on several lines, including parts of the Green and Yellow line, which both stop there. Blue, Orange and Silver lines were bypassing the stop for a period of time, but resumed service Monday evening. Tuesday morning service will be dicey, according to the WMATA website.  ""All Yellow Line service will be replaced with additional Blue Line trains"" until the Yellow line returns to regular service.  Other trains will be delayed. Following the incident, emergency vehicles crowded the streets around the complex of office buildings that make up L'Enfant Plaza. The buildings largely house private businesses, but the U.S. Postal Service is also headquartered at L'Enfant Plaza. Alec Dubois, a freshman at Gonzaga College High School, told CNN affiliate WJLA he was in a tunnel on a train near the station when smoke started filling the air. ""People were freaking out, going everywhere. The conductor was telling us to stay calm. He said he was trying to get our train back to the station. We had no cell service. I was trying to call my parents. And then there was black stuff everywhere, it was all over my pants, too. It was under our noses. We have no idea what it was."" ""We decided to go out one of the side doors and then we started walking on the rails,"" he said. ""Once we got out of the station, we just sprinted for our lives...because we had no idea what was happening."" He described the smoke as ""translucent."" Lesley Lopez, a metro rider who was there when the smoke broke out, said she ""wasn't sure what was happening, and then I heard a voice say, 'Get out of the train station.'"" The longtime metro rider said, however, the evacuation was ""poorly managed,"" and that she was ""disturbed"" by the fact she was given no evacuation instructions or indication of what had happened. ""It's disheartening because there did not appear to be an emergency plan,"" she said. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser issued a statement following the incident thanking city first responders and offering her condolences to the family of the dead passenger. Video from CNN affiliate WJLA showed emergency crews taking several people from the station on gurneys.

"(CNN)A North Korean ambassador insisted that his country had nothing to do with the massive computer hack at Sony and called for the United States, which has blamed North Korea, to provide evidence. The United States hit North Korea with new sanctions this month after the FBI said the country was behind the attack.  Some technology experts say others could be involved, such as former employees of the studio. But the FBI director has expressed ""not just high confidence, but very high confidence,"" that North Korea was behind the hacking. In a rare press briefing on Tuesday,  An Myong Hun, North Korea's deputy U.N. ambassador, emphatically denied his country's involvement. ""My country has nothing to do with the Sony hacking. It is out of sense to do that, and we very want United States to provide evidence,"" An said. He said that North Korea had offered last week to the United States to ""undertake joint investigation"" into the hacking scandal. Despite having applauded the hacking ""a righteous deed"" and condemning ""The Interview"" as ""a disgusting movie openly agitating terrorism against a sovereign state,"" North Korea has consistently denied responsibility. At the same time, it has blamed the U.S. government for being behind the making of the Seth Rogen-James Franco film. North Korea government has warned the United States that its ""citadels"" will be attacked, dwarfing the hacking attack on Sony. At a briefing on the subject, Rep. Ed Royce, a California Republican and chairman of the House Foreign Relations Committee, called to ""cut off hard currency"" so North Korea cannot carry out offensive attacks like the cyber attacks. NSA will lead fight against future hacks . U.S. hits back with sanctions .

Sony Pictures made ""The Interview,"" a comedy depicting the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The White House imposed sanctions this month targeting leaders in North Korea's government, preventing them from accessing property and entering the United States. The isolated nuclear regime, which has denied involvement in the Sony hack, was already subject to a strict set of U.S. economic restrictions. ""We have made clear that we will respond to the DPRK's misbehavior,"" said Sung Kim, the U.S. special representative for North Korea policy. ""We are under no illusions about the DPRK's willingness to abandon its illicit weapons, provocations and human rights abuses on its own."" The U.S. Department of Treasury has designated three North Korean entities -- including the Reconnaissance General Bureau, the Korea Mining Development Trading Corporation and Korean Tangun Trading Corporation -- and 10 officials based around the world as ""critical North Korean operatives."" The aim of the sanctions is to isolate North Korea and cut off their entities from being able to use the international financial system, said Daniel Glaser, assistant secretary of the Department of Treasury, during a briefing about the hacking on Tuesday. Royce, the committee chairman, urged for stronger measures against North Korea. ""We need to step up and target those financial institutions in Asia and beyond that are supporting the brutal and dangerous North Korean regime,"" he said. ""Such sanctions have crippled North Korea in the past, leaving the regime unable to buy the loyalty of its generals.""

"(CNN)Briggs Fussy doesn't remember much about walking down the aisle 20 years ago with the woman who would eventually become his wife. ""I don't really remember the wedding part at all,"" Briggs said.  ""I didn't even talk to her."" A groom not remembering the wedding could undoubtedly crush a bride, especially a bride like Brittney Fussy, who admits she's been planning her wedding since she was a little girl. But Brittney Fussy said the only thing she remembers about their trip down the aisle was her partner's unique name. ""I don't remember too much about being a flower girl,"" she said. Briggs and Brittney Fussy took their first walk down the aisle when they were just 3, as a ring bearer and flower girl in the wedding of Briggs' godmother.  The couple took their second walk down the aisle Saturday to become husband and wife. The couple, who failed to leave an impression on each other at their first wedding, reunited years later in their ninth grade in a government class at Blaine High School, north of Minneapolis. Share your true love story: How did you meet? Briggs had just transferred to Brittney's school; she said she knew the moment she heard the teacher say his name that it had to be the same Briggs who walked her down the aisle all those years ago. ""I confirmed it with my mom,"" Brittney said before she said anything to Briggs and then the couple laughed about how both of their moms had pictures of the pair hanging up at their respective houses. They didn't become a couple until junior year and eventually separated to attend college in separate cities -- Briggs to the University of Wisconsin, LaCrosse, and Brittney to Minnesota State University, Mankato. A few years into the long-distance relationship, Briggs returned to Minnesota State to be with his beloved. ""I knew I was going to marry her,"" he said. Before they tied the knot over the weekend, the couple viewed the video of themselves in the wedding. Briggs called it ""hilarious."" Brittney said she was the ""obnoxious flower girl,"" who can be seen on wedding video weaving in and out bridesmaids.  At one point, she pauses in front of the bride to look up at her.  Briggs, on the other hand, stood calmly in the same place for the entirety of the ceremony. ""I'm such a rule follower -- I'm sure someone said 'stay still,' and I never moved,"" Briggs said. Brittney promises she's a rule follower now, too, but contends she and her groom can both be ""pretty weird and outspoken"" sometimes. The picture of the two of them at age 3 is now framed in their own home, and they even reenacted the photograph at their own wedding. ""I'm pretty cheesy when it comes to love stuff, I'm not going to lie,"" Brittney said. Briggs and Brittney, who are both finishing up their degrees in economics and elementary education at Minnesota State, Mantoka, said they didn't really understand what all the fuss was about regarding their story at first. But they said they have known all along that they were meant to be. ""It's all a part of God's plan,"" she said, ""All fate for sure."" As for their second time down the aisle, the couple said it's far more memorable than their first. ""It was wonderful,"" Brittney said.

"(CNN)Given his sailing pedigree it's the last thing you would expect, but America's Cup hero Sir Ben Ainslie had to send out a distress call after sailing into trouble on his honeymoon. And who better to answer a knight's call for help than another knight of the British realm, Sir Richard Branson. A four-time Olympic sailing gold medalist, Ainslie was on honeymoon in the Caribbean with his new wife, British TV presenter Georgie Thompson, when the furling system broke on the vessel's main sail. ""Seeing as Ben is one of the greatest sailors of all time, what we didn't except to see was his boat getting into trouble!"" Branson explained on his blog. ""However, his boat had a serious mechanical problem, in no way Ben's fault, and he put a message out asking for help."" Ainslie was sailing close to Branson's private Necker Island, where some of the tycoon's staff soon sailed to the rescue helping to cut the tangled sail to pieces. ""Unsurprisingly, Ben kept an amazingly cool head whilst directing operations -- he just needed more hands to sort out the mess,"" the billionaire added. It's not the first Ainslie has extricated himself from sticky situations. The 37-year-old Briton captured a fourth consecutive gold at the 2012 London Olympics after a poor start to the competition. The following year he played a pivotal role in Oracle Team USA's dramatic America's Cup win. He joined the crew as the team's tactician and helped turn an 8-1 deficit into a 9-8 triumph. Once back on dry land, the newly weds holidayed with Branson on Necker Island for a few days. The sailing star will be soon returning to his life on the ocean waves as he continues his plan to lead a British team to victory in the next edition of the America's Cup in 2017.","Sir Ben Ainslie is rescued by Sir Richard Branson while sailing on his honeymoon .

"(CNN)Sen. Marco Rubio said he'll make a decision on running for president in the next few weeks and feels confident that he could obtain the resources to ""credibly run a campaign and win,"" despite an increasingly crowded GOP field taking shape. In a wide-ranging interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer, the Florida Republican also gave his thoughts on Republican efforts to defund the president's executive action on immigration, and further explained why he won't support the administration's new Cuba policy. 2016 . Rubio, who released a new book ""American Dreams"" on Tuesday, said he's still deciding whether he thinks he can be more effective as president or as a senator under the new majority. He has already said he won't run for both offices in 2016. Marco Rubio: Radicalized individuals 'very real threat' to the West . With power players Mitt Romney and Jeb Bush now considered likely contenders, Rubio said ""they're both credible and well-funded"" candidates but argued there would still be room for his campaign if he decides to plow forward. ""I'm confident that if we decide to run for president ... we will have the funding and the resources necessary to credibly run a campaign and win,"" he said. ""But I understand that the longer you wait, the harder it becomes to do that,"" he added. Romney tells donors he's considering 2016 bid . Bush and Romney have already been in active in talking with big-money supporters and securing financial resources, making it strategically more difficult for other potential contenders like Rubio to lock down support from the GOP's donor class. Rubio, 43, will huddle with donors and supporters at a retreat he's hosting in Florida later this month, where plans could be formalized for 2016. He said he doesn't have a date in mind to make a decision, only saying he'll decide ""soon enough so that you can build the kind of campaign it takes to win."" Source: Rubio on track for 2016 run . Pressed on whether that means ""within the next few weeks,"" Rubio replied: ""Yes, soon."" Executive action . To combat President Barack Obama's executive action on immigration — which would allow up to 5 million undocumented immigrants to stay in the country temporarily -- Republicans on Capitol Hill are pushing a strategy to tie funding for the order to a must-pass spending bill for the Department of Homeland Security. House GOP plans immigration showdown . Rubio, however, questioned whether it was the right move, saying he's not in favor of ""something that would be traumatic for the country or something that would put the nation in danger."" ""I could support that, but ultimately if there's going to be a veto threat — as I'm sure there will be and the consequences of that is that we can't secure our nation -- that would be a real problem for a lot of people,"" he said. ""For me included."" He added ""if there was a way to do it that overcomes that obstacle, I would be all for it."" Rubio was among a bipartisan Gang of Eight senators who helped craft a comprehensive immigration reform package that passed in mid-2013 but failed to advance in the House. He said he doesn't regret being part of the process but argued he wouldn't do it the same way again. ""We learned that you're not going to reform immigration law in America with...everything all in one big bill,"" he said. ""I think that is true for multiple topics.  I think that is especially true when it comes to immigration."" As he also lays out in his book, Rubio said the ""only way"" to address immigration reform will be through a sequence of bills, rather than one massive reform package -- with the first step being to better enforce current immigration law and with a pathway to citizenship as an ultimate goal of reform. Cuba . Following Obama's announcement last month to loosen the U.S. embargo on Cuba, Rubio said he still plans to vote against any new funding for a U.S. embassy in Havana. He also criticized the Cuban Interests Section in Washington — a diplomatic mission in the nation's capital — as ""almost an exclusively intelligence gathering outpost."" ""I mean, they conduct no diplomacy and there are a large number of people trying to get into Cuba,"" Rubio said. ""The reason why our Interests Section is so busy is the large number of people trying to get out of Cuba."" 2016 Republicans slam Cuba announcement . The junior senator from Florida, whose parents emigrated from Cuba, said any policy change towards Cuba must be met with ""reciprocal steps."" ""If you want a better relationship with us economically, that should have been as a result of an opening politically on the island of Cuba,"" he said.","Sen. Marco Rubio tells CNN's Wolf Blitzer that he'll make a decision on 2016 in a few weeks .

"Cambridge, Massachusetts (CNN) -- A century ago, the rise of Germany and the fear it created in Britain led to world war. Some analysts predict a similar fate from the rise of China and the fear that is creating in the United States. One should be skeptical about such dire projections. By 1900, Germany had surpassed Britain in industrial power, and Kaiser Wilhelm II was pursuing an adventurous, globally oriented foreign policy that was bound to bring about a clash with other great powers. In contrast, China still lags far behind the United States economically and militarily, and has focused its policies primarily on its region and on its economic development. While its ""market Leninist"" economic model (the so-called ""Beijing Consensus"") provides soft power in authoritarian countries, it has the opposite effect in many democracies. Soft power is the ability to produce preferred outcomes by attraction rather than coercion or payment, and China has announced major efforts to increase its soft power. Watch an interview with Joseph Nye . Even if China's gross domestic product passes that of the United States around 2030 (as Goldman Sachs projects), the two economies would be equivalent in size, but not equal in composition. China would still have a vast underdeveloped countryside, and it will begin to face demographic problems from the delayed effects of the one child per couple policy it enforced in the 20th century. Moreover, as countries develop, there is a tendency for growth rates to slow. TED.com: Asia's rise...how and when . Assuming a 6 percent Chinese growth and only 2 percent American growth after 2030, China would not equal the United States in per capita income until sometime in the second half of the century. China is a long way from posing the kind of challenge to America that the kaiser's Germany posed when it passed Britain at the beginning of the last century. Unlike India, which was born with a democratic constitution, China has not yet found a way to solve the problem of demands for political participation (if not democracy) that tend to accompany rising per capita income. The ideology of communism is long gone, and the legitimacy of the ruling party depends upon economic growth and ethnic Han nationalism. Premier Wen Jiabao talks of reform but faces conservative resistance. The Chinese political system suffers from a high level of corruption, and should the economy falter, it is vulnerable to political unrest. Whether China can develop a formula that can manage an expanding urban middle class, regional inequality, and resentment among ethnic minorities remains to be seen. Xi Jinping has been anointed the likely next leader (in 2012), but not even he knows how China's political future will evolve. The current generation of Chinese leaders, realizing that rapid economic growth is the key to domestic political stability, has focused on economic development and what they call a ""harmonious"" international environment that will not disrupt their country's growth. But generations change, power often creates hubris, and appetites sometimes grow with eating. Already, some younger party members and military men argue that China's success in recovery from the global financial crisis should lead to a greater political role. And the United States objected last summer when China defined its ""core interests"" as including the distant waters of the South China Sea. TED.com: Why nations should pursue ""soft power"" Whatever Chinese intentions are, it is doubtful that China will have the military capability to expel the United States from East Asia. The region has its own internal balance of powers, and in that context, many states welcome an American presence in the region. Chinese leaders will have to contend with the reactions of other countries as well as the constraints created by their own objectives of economic growth and the need for external markets and resources. Too aggressive a Chinese military posture could produce a countervailing coalition among its neighbors that would weaken both its hard and soft power. China's recent overreaction to a maritime collision near the disputed Senkaku islands led to a hardening of attitudes in Japan. A recent Pew poll of 16 countries around the world found a positive attitude towards China's economic rise, but not its military rise. The fact that China is not likely to become a peer competitor to the United States on a global basis does not mean that the dangers of conflict in Asia can be completely ruled out. But given the global challenges such as financial stability, cybersecurity, and climate change that both China and the United States will face, they have much to gain from working together. Unfortunately, hubris and nationalism among some Chinese and unnecessary fear of decline among some Americans make it difficult to assure this future. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Joseph S. Nye.","Joseph Nye, who coined term ""soft power,"" says China's power is far behind that of U.S.
He says rise of Germany a century ago threatened Britain, led to world war .
Nye says China's focus has been on its own region .
He says China has major internal and external challenges to overcome ."
"World number two Rafael Nadal has sensationally lost to Fernando Verdasco 6-3 3-6 7-5 in the third round of the Madrid Open. The loss was the first defeat of the clay court season for the six-time French  Open champion. Considered arguably the greatest player to ever set foot on clay, Nadal had recently won in Monte Carlo -- a record eighth title -- before clinching his seventh tournament victory in Barcelona. He had previously beaten Verdasco in all 13 of their previous meetings. It took Verdasco three hours and 11 minutes to overcome Nadal in an error-strewn match. Verdasco hit nine double faults but Nadal somehow conspired to lose despite leading 5-2 in the final set. It brought to an end a 22-match winning streak for Nadal that stretched back to 2011. ""I never was in control of the match, I didn't know how to win a point,""  Nadal told reporters, before suggesting he will not show up next year unless the controversial blue clay surface is changed. ""Movement is very important for me and I couldn't move. I couldn't hit ball the way I wanted. I lost because I deserved to lose."" The shock defeat will reopen the debate about the Madrid Open's use of blue clay. World number one Novak Djokovic has already been an outspoken critic of the surface. ""It's impossible to move,"" he told reporters earlier in the week. ""I cannot find the words to describe this court. It's really tough to play like this on a center court. We need serious discussion about the future of this blue clay. ""We cannot change anything this year, but my first impressions are not good. I don't want to be the one complaining, but I say honestly what I feel."" Ironically it was Nadal that refused to be drawn on the issue of the blue clay after he had comfortably beaten Russia's Nikolay Davydenko in straight sets 6-2 6-2 on Wednesday. ""It was my first match here in these circumstances,"" he said.  ""I am very happy about my result, about the way that I played."" But Nadal changed his tone after the defeat. ""I couldn't close out the match at 5-2. He played better than me,"" he said. ""The ATP and the tournament can do what they want, I tried my best, I've  trained here since Thursday. I was as prepared as I could be. ""I was not good enough to adapt my game to this court. If things continue  like this, it will be very sad. Next year this will be one less event for my calendar."" Verdasco will next play sixth-seeded Czech Tomas Berdych in the next round. Despite his complaints about the surface, Djokovic moved into the quarterfinals after beating Switzerland's Stanislas  Wawrinka 7-6 6-4. Roger Federer also reached the quarterfinals after dispatching French 14th seed Richard Gasquet 6-3 6-2. The win, coupled with Nadal's shock loss, means that Federer will move up to second in the world rankings ahead of the Spaniard. Meanwhile Serena Williams fought back after a disastrous start against Caroline Wozniacki to reach the quarterfinals of the women's event in Madrid. The American lost the first set 6-1, before storming back 6-3 6-2 to set up a mouthwatering tie against Russian second seed Maria Sharapova, who made the last eight after Lucie Safarova  withdrew citing an illness. ""I had a slow start today, I don't know why,"" said Williams. ""I was  sluggish and mentally maybe fighting some demons."" Polish fourth seed Agnieszka Radwanska continued her fine form by beating Italy's Roberta Vinci  7-6 (7-1) 6-4.","Rafael Nadal loses to Fernando Verdasco in three hours at the Madrid Open .

"Thousands of Chinese protesters hurled bottles and eggs outside the Japanese embassy in Beijing over the weekend amid growing tensions between the two nations over a group of disputed islands. Waving Chinese national flags and holding portraits of the late Chairman Mao Zedong, the mostly young protesters chanted ""down with Japanese imperialism"" and called for war as they made their way down the streets under the watchful eyes of police and guards. Elsewhere in China, anti-Japanese rallies broke out in dozens of cities and sometimes turned violent. Messages and photos posted on Chinese social media sites showed angry mobs in numerous cities ransacking Japanese stores and restaurants as well as smashing and burning cars of Japanese make. Japanese media also reported incidents of assault on Japanese nationals in China in the past few days. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman insisted Friday that the public anger was not aimed at the Japanese people, whose safety would be protected in China according to law. Authorities rarely permit protests in China, prompting suspicion that Saturday's nationwide rallies were government-sanctioned. In Beijing, police walking along the demonstrators were seen to ask spectators to join in instead of blocking the street. By Saturday night, China's state-run media had started appealing for restraint, running commentaries that condemned violence and lectured the public on the true meaning of patriotism. In a sign of rising concern over the gathering of large crowds, authorities in cities that had seen the most ferocious protests canceled entertainment and sporting events. Asian islands dispute: Who claims what? Tensions escalated Friday when Chinese maritime surveillance ships ignored warnings from Japan and briefly entered waters around the group of islands at the center of the heated territorial dispute. The ships arrived near the uninhabited islands -- which Japan calls Senkaku and China calls Diaoyu -- and began patrols and ""law enforcement,"" China's state-run news agency Xinhua reported. Economic consequences of island spat . The islands, situated in the East China Sea between Okinawa and Taiwan, are under Japanese control, but China claims they have been a part of its territory for ages. The long-running argument over who has sovereignty has triggered  protests in both nations. The United States,a key ally of Japan, has repeatedly urged Tokyo and Beijing to resolve the dispute through dialogue. U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta will meet with his counterparts in Japan and China this weekend, the Department of Defense said Thursday. Chinese vessels had all left the waters by Friday afternoon and headed north, the Japanese Coast Guard said. Japan said it will intensify patrols of the area. The controversial Chinese move to begin patrols around the islands follows Japan's purchase of several of the islands from a private owner this week.  China described the deal as ""illegal and invalid."" Animosity between the two countries over the islands runs deep. They have come to represent what many Chinese see as unfinished business: redressing the impact of the Japanese occupation of large swathes of eastern China during the 1930s and 1940s. China says its claim goes back hundreds of years. Japan says it saw no trace of Chinese control of the islands in an 1885 survey, so formally recognized them as Japanese sovereign territory in 1895. Japan then sold the islands in 1932 to descendants of the original settlers. The Japanese surrender at the end of World War II in 1945 only served to cloud the issue further. The islands were administered by the U.S. occupation force after the war. But in 1972, Washington returned them to Japan as part of its withdrawal from Okinawa.","Chinese ships briefly enter waters around the group of islands .

"(CNN)Making New Year's resolutions is easy. Keeping them past January is not. Why? Because simply resolving to do something isn't enough. You need the means to start on the right path and stay the course. Too many of us set large-scale intentions but fall short on a follow-through strategy. That's where yoga comes in:  the ancient practice can provide the resources and support for a multitude of modern-day lifestyle changes. If you've set any of the top resolutions -- like being happier, getting healthier or sleeping better -- yoga offers ways to transform your resolutions into lasting reality.  And it doesn't matter if you're a seasoned yogi or never stepped onto a mat, you can leverage yoga to realize your most ambitious lifestyle goals. Here are seven popular resolutions and how you can fulfill them with yoga: . 1. Be happier . If you want to be happier, your wandering mind is likely your biggest obstacle. According to a 2010 Harvard study, people spend 47% of their time thinking about things that aren't happening. Understandably, spending half your life lost in thought is considered a major cause of unhappiness. Yoga is a practice based on mindfulness and awareness that emphasizes using your breath to consistently connect to the present moment. It also teaches you how to breathe deeper and use meditative techniques to tap into your parasympathetic nervous system to reduce stress and increase happy hormones. 2. Get healthier . Whether you're looking to lower your blood pressure, reduce stress or lose weight, studies abound showing the benefits of yoga for these issues. Weight loss is probably the most popular resolution made and broken. Yoga's overall focus on body awareness and the present moment can help practitioners enhance self control and avoid mindless eating, which are important for long-term success with weight loss.  And, although yoga isn't the ideal cardiovascular exercise, certain styles, like Power Yoga and Ashtanga, can increase muscle mass, which burns more calories. 3. Sleep better . Yoga is very helpful in facilitating sleep! I've created numerous yoga-based sleep programs for my professional athletes and celebrity clients, whose demanding schedules make sleeping difficult. Using yoga stretches to release tension and enhance blood flow in the abdomen, combined with meditative techniques and diaphragmatic breathing focused on exhaling produces a natural sedative effect in the body. 4. Make friends . If you're looking to forge friendships, look no further than your local yoga studio! Studios build their businesses around a sense of community. Most hold events in and out of the studio -- from book clubs to cocktail parties -- to foster relationships among students. Christina Lowden, co-owner of Trinity Yoga in New Port Richey, Florida, says, ""yoga tends to attract like-minded people, so relationships blossom easily while chatting after class or at special events."" 5. Volunteer more . Volunteering is an admirable resolution but it can be surprisingly daunting to find the right organization to donate your time. Let your yoga studio take the guesswork out of volunteering and make getting involved an easier process. Most yoga studios are affiliated with a charity, and often donate time to schools, prisons or shelters. For example, Lowden says her studio recently helped start a facility for homeless and struggling veterans. 6. Travel . If traveling more is one of your goals, yoga can provide the impetus. Yoga retreats take place all over the world, ranging from weekend workshops to month-long immersions. Whether you're into modest camping trips or five-star luxury hotels in exotic locations, you can find a retreat that's perfect for you. Check out www.bookyogaretreats.com, which claims to be ""the world's largest yoga travel site."" 7. Learn something new . Maybe the practice of yoga is new to you. If that's the case, there's your resolution! But if you've been practicing a while, there are opportunities to expand your knowledge into related subjects. You can explore energy chakras, learn new forms of meditation or even become a yoga teacher.  A quick online search will reveal boundless books, courses and certification programs on any yoga-related topic that interests you. And, chances are a studio near you will have a related workshop on their schedule. ""Every January, our studio holds workshops on the yoga philosophy of the Yamas and Niyamas,"" says Lowden. ""Being kind, truthful and balanced in life may not be new thoughts, but the reminder of these qualities as the backdrop of a yoga practice can inspire new resolutions."" Regardless of your resolution, if you need inspiration and support to get over the January hump and achieve lasting change, try spending some time on your yoga mat.","Yoga is a useful tool to help keep New Year's resolutions .
It can offer a way to stay in shape, make new friends, sleep better and travel more ."
"(CNN)It's safe to say Matthew McConaughey nailed it during his audition for ""Dazed and Confused."" We already know the actor went on to become a superstar who immortalized the words ""All right, all right, all right,"" but thanks to the wonders of the Internet, we can watch the magic begin during his tryout for the film. A video of McConaughey's audition is making the rounds in honor of the Criterion release of the 1993 Richard Linklater film. There's the young actor looking majorly relaxed (he is playing a stoner, after all) and tossing off lines like ""That's what I love about high school girls, man. I keep getting older, but they stay the same age."" Here are some other stars who also set out to wow casting directors with their takes on characters. Robert De Niro auditions for 'The Godfather' De Niro didn't snag the role of Sonny Corleone (that went to James Caan) in the epic film, but we suspect that director Francis Ford Coppola saw something he liked in the then-lesser known performer, as De Niro was cast as the young Vito Corleone in  ""The Godfather II."" Scarlett Johansson's 'Jumanji' audition . Even as a little girl, Johansson had star power and beauty. She makes going out for the role of Judy Shepherd look effortless (though the part eventually went to Kirsten Dunst). Jimmy Fallon's 'SNL' audition . ""Saturday Night Live"" made him a star, and now he's a big-time talk show host. But years ago, Fallon used his celebrity impressions of stars like John Travolta, Jerry Seinfeld, Chris Rock and Adam Sandler to get his foot in the door. Chris Colfer's 'Glee' audition . Colfer slayed when he tried out for the role of Kurt Hummel. You can hear the delight in the room when he sings ""Mr. Cellophane."" Gabourey Sidibe's 'Precious' audition . This one is pretty deep. Sidibe shows off her acting chops as she reveals, in character, that she is HIV-positive. Mark Hamill's 'Star Wars' audition . It now seems incomprehensible that anyone but Mark Hamill could have played Luke Skywalker in ""Star Wars,"" but who knows what would have happened had he not done as well in his 1977 audition. Rachel McAdams audition for 'The Notebook' You'll probably have a better reaction to McAdams' tryout for ""The Notebook."" The film made her a part of pop culture, but the actress cringed when ""Today's"" Matt Lauer surprised her with her audition tape.","McConaughey's audition tape shows the actor before he was a star .

"(CNN) -- Argentina's central bank president was removed from his post by presidential decree, a possible final blow in a political standoff between the banker and the executive. Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner's decree on Thursday removed Central Bank President Martin Redrado from his post for ""misconduct and dereliction of duty by a public servant,"" the state-run Telam news agency reported. But Redrado may not go easily. Because of the decree, the central bank chief and his supporters were ""already analyzing all available legal measures"" to maintain his post, a central bank official familiar with the developments told CNN en Español. The source asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue. Earlier this week, the president announced she had accepted Redrado's resignation after the bank chief declined to support a plan to use $6.5 billion in reserves to pay the country's debt. Redrado retorted that he had not resigned, and that only the Congress, not the president, could remove him. Opposition politicians advised Redrado not to abide by the decree and to seek an injunction to protect his rights, the central bank source said. The dispute appeared to stem from a government plan to use $6.5 billion in reserves from the Central Bank to pay down debt, something that the central bank, as an independent body, declined to do. According to Redrado, the proposal should be studied to see if such a request should come from the congress, rather than the nation's president. Redrado's current term ends in September. Sergio Berensztein, a professor at Torcuato Di Tella University in Argentina, said the outcome of the power struggle between Redrado and Fernandez de Kirchner could set a precedent of how Argentina deals with increasing government expenditures in the face of low government revenue. Public spending is higher than government revenue in Argentina, creating the need to turn to the country's central bank. However, Berensztein told CNN en Español that decisions to draw money from the central bank must come from congress, rather than presidential decree. ""The most important thing here is that there is a overstepping by the executive, in violation of central bank autonomy,"" he said.","NEW: Redrado may not go easily .
Redrado has said only Congress, not president, could remove him .

"(CNN)Andrew Brannan, a decorated Vietnam War veteran convicted of murdering a 22-year-old sheriff's deputy in 1998, was executed Tuesday, said Gwendolyn Hogan, spokeswoman for the Georgia Department of Corrections. Earlier in the day, the Georgia Supreme Court joined the state's parole board in declining to stop the execution. The justices denied a stay of execution by a vote of 6-1, with one justice not participating. Brannan was scheduled to die of lethal injection at 7 p.m. ET Tuesday at the Georgia Diagnostic and Classification Prison in Jackson. Hogan said the court ordered execution was carried out at 8:33 p.m. ET. She said a final statement was given, expressing remorse to the family of the slain deputy. The state's high court had also denied Brannan's request for an appeal on the basis that it is unconstitutional to execute a person with his medical conditions and combat history. In denying clemency late Monday, the State Board of Pardons and Paroles said, ""In reaching its decision, in addition to hearing testimony during the meeting on Monday, the board prior to the meeting had thoroughly reviewed the parole case file on the inmate, which includes the circumstances of the death penalty case, the inmate's criminal history, and a comprehensive history of the inmate's life."" Attorneys for the 66-year-old Brannan had hoped his sentence would be found unconstitutional. His defense attorneys claim Brannan, who served in Vietnam in the early 1970s, was suffering from post-traumatic stress and bipolar disorder at the time of the shooting and was off his medication. In a petition filed Monday with Butts County Superior Court, Brannan's attorneys requested his life be spared because ""executing American combat veterans whose service-related mental impairments played a role in subsequent violent conduct violates the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and analogous provisions of the Georgia Constitution."" The document went on to say ""death is inappropriate for those with diminished capacities to understand and process information, to communicate, to abstract from mistakes and learn from experience, to engage in logical reasoning, to control impulses and to understand the reactions of others."" Attorneys Joseph Loveland Jr. and Brian Kammer, who represent Brannan, say that the death penalty is reserved for the ""worst of the worst"" offenders who commit murder and that Brannan does not fit that category. They contend his mental problems were directly related to his combat service and defense of the country's interests and ideals. The killing of Laurens County Deputy Kyle Dinkheller was captured on the deputy's dash camera just outside Dublin, Georgia. Versions of the video have been uploaded to YouTube. Brannan is seen in the video confronting Dinkheller after being pulled over for driving almost 100 mph in his pickup. Brannan appears to be confrontational from the start, acting irrational as the deputy tells him to keep his hands out of his pocket. He then mocks the deputy and at one point seems to dance around yelling, ""Shoot me,"" at Dinkheller. Brannan then yells that he is a Vietnam veteran. He lunges at the deputy before he runs back to his truck, grabs a rifle and begins to shoot. The video goes on to show a heated gunbattle as both men hide behind their vehicles for cover. Bullets appear to pierce the windshield of the deputy's car. Brannan's car door window shatters above his head. In the video, Dinkheller and Brannan are shot and wounded in the battle. Brannan advances on the deputy, and off camera, you hear the deputy scream before Brannan repeatedly shoots him and then flees the scene. Dinkheller died, leaving behind a wife and child. Brannan, who had no criminal record before the shooting, was convicted of the murder in 2000. During the trial, attorney Kammer says the defense presented evidence that Brannan suffered from PTSD but claims that crucial testimony from a Veterans Affairs doctor treating him was never heard. His sentence was appealed, and a judge ordered a new sentencing trial, but that was later overturned by the Georgia Supreme Court. Dinkheller's father, Kirk Dinkheller, posted on his Facebook page this month that ""January 12, 2015 it will be 17 years since my son Kyle was murdered in the line of duty and on January 13, 2015 his killer will finally be held accountable. Nothing will ever bring my son back, but finally some justice for the one who took him from his children and his family.""

"(CNN)The children of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. will be in an Atlanta court Tuesday in the latest chapter of an ugly legal fight pitting the two brothers against their sister. At issue: control over two precious items that belonged to their father, his Bible and his Nobel Peace Prize. Bernice King contends her brothers aim to sell them, something she robustly opposes. Dexter King and Martin Luther King III succeeded last year in getting Bernice King to hand over the relics.

Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney could soon decide which side will ultimately control the items. The Bible, which King took on the road with him, was used to swear in President Barack Obama for his second term.

That image: of a civil rights icon being recognized for his work stands sharply at odds with the public fight between the siblings. Something Bernice King herself has noted, calling it ""an embarrassing chapter in our family's history."" Before the case ended up in a courtroom, the siblings held a vote to determine if they should sell the items. The three make up the board of the King Estate. The brothers say that the future of the estate would be threatened if a sale could not be made. They both voted to sell, Bernice voted against. No prospective buyers or dollar amount have been publicly disclosed. In 2006 the estate put King's papers on the auction block. But before the planned sale at Sotheby's could go forward a group of anonymous buyers stepped in. The group paid an ""undisclosed amount"" for the 10,000 manuscripts and books, including drafts of his ""I Have a Dream"" speech. The collection, which had been expected to go for as much as $30 million, is now housed at Morehouse College in Atlanta. Two years later Bernice and Martin filed suit against Dexter. They accused him of converting ""substantial funds from the estate's financial account at Bank of America"" for his own use. The case was later settled.","Dexter King, Martin Luther King III want to sell MLK's Bible and Nobel Peace Prize .

"(CNN) -- The son of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi early Monday proposed the speedy implementation of significant democratic reforms in the traditionally restrictive country, while warning of a chaotic civil war, return to colonialism and mass poverty if citizens sided with anti-government demonstrators. ""Tomorrow, we can speak rationally, we can spare the blood, we can stand all together for the sake of Libya,"" Saif al-Islam Gadhafi said during a speech on Libyan state television that he said was unscripted. But if the unrest continues, ""forget about democracy, forget about reform ... It will be a fierce civil war."" While criticizing international media for overstating its extent, the younger Gadhafi acknowledged the violence in Libya as well as ""mistakes"" by police and military in addressing unrest. Still, he principally blamed drunks, criminals and foreigners for fanning dissent and instigating attacks that threatened to tear apart Libya. Gadhafi: Libya's flamboyant, mercurial ruler . Eyewitnesses told CNN by phone about tear gas and gunfire targeting anti-government demonstrators in Tripoli, and claimed that -- after days of unrest that left at least 219 dead, according to medical sources -- opposition forces had taken over Benghazi. Saif Gadhafi didn't confirm that assertion, though he did call out anti-government elements for ""sedition."" Who is Saif al-Islam Gadhafi? ""This is a national treason,"" he said. ""Each one of us wants to be a leader, each one of us wants to be a prince."" Obtaining independent confirmation on events in Libya is very difficult. The Libyan government maintains tight control on communications and has not responded to repeated requests from CNN for access to the country. CNN has interviewed, however, numerous witnesses by phone. Saif Gadhafi, appointed in 2009 as Libya's general coordinator, insisted his father, Moammar, was not like recently deposed Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. He also said Libya was unlike those two countries, predicting that its civil war would be ""1,000 times worse"" and its economic hardship even more severe should the current government fall. He conceded these are ""difficult times"" and that ""there are people inside Libya who are opposing us."" Even while he cast blame, the leader's son also acknowledged changing times regionally and proposed ""radical"" reforms -- like bolstering local governments, relaxing restrictive laws, raising salaries, extending loans and drafting a constitution, which doesn't now exist. Michele Dunne, an expert at the Carnegie Endowment for Peace, noted that the Western-educated Saif Gadhafi has pushed such reforms previously, but they have not gotten much traction. Meanwhile, eyewitnesses -- who are not being identified, for security reasons -- told CNN about significant movement and growing violence on Sunday, the sixth consecutive day of unrest in the isolated and reclusive North African nation. Medical sources and others on the ground have said that at least 219 had died nationwide in the violence. Saif Gadhafi, though, claimed in his speech that international media had overstated the death toll. He also claimed foreign nations and ""illegal immigrants"" had stirred the uprising, with some dissenters attacking government installations as well as stealing caches of weapons. The central government lost control of Benghazi, with multiple witnesses reporting that protesters took over Libya's second-largest city with support from some military who dropped their allegiance to Moammar Gadhafi. However, his son continued to insist the military remained loyal to the ruling government and would be taking an increasingly active role in suppressing unrest in the coming days. The reported power shift followed fresh clashes that left 25 dead earlier in the day, a doctor at Benghazi's Al Jalla Hospital said. A source at Benghazi Medical Center, the city's other major hospital, said there were 10 people dead there Sunday. One man told CNN that uniformed troops opened fire on thousands of mourners as they passed through the streets during a funeral procession honoring those killed the previous day. Protesters later Sunday packed at least one car with explosives and sent it crashing into a compound wall at a military camp in the eastern city, eyewitnesses said. Security forces then fired on the protesters as they attempted to breach the camp. On the camp's southern side, meanwhile, protesters drove a tank from a nearby army base in another attempt to break in, witnesses said. They have also obtained other weapons, the protester said. Libyan state television reported the camp has been defended, and that protesters were being warned on loudspeakers not to attack the compound. The network called it an act of sabotage. The protester said that the military camp is significant because it houses Gadhafi's eastern palace. ""It's a symbol of his dominance here,"" he said. ""And it's the last symbol, basically."" A protester said some fellow anti-government demonstrators had other weapons. Saif Gadhafi alluded to this claim in his speech early Monday, claiming criminal elements had stolen weaponry and even fired them in an attempt to cast blame on military and security forces. People said there was a food shortage in parts of Benghazi. The internet remained down in the city and electricity was cut off for the second night in the row, but was back in the morning. One man, a technology expert who has set up cameras airing live online video streams around Benghazi, estimated that the numbers of anti-government demonstrators in the city has grown by 20% since the protests began Tuesday. ""There are a lot of people getting killed for their freedom,"" he said Sunday. ""Our goal is simple: We want Gadhafi to leave. We want freedom. ... We want democracy."" Others in Libya reported similar protests in the cities of al-Baida, Ajdabiya and significantly in Misratah -- an indication that the demonstrations centered in the east may be spreading west. Meanwhile, the most significant unrest to date hit Moammar Gadhafi's doorstep of Tripoli on Sunday. Clashes broke out between a large crowd of demonstrators and people who appeared to be African mercenaries in the center of the city, according to an activist. Elsewhere, hundreds of protesters were demonstrating in front of the courthouse, the activist said. Both groups were calling for the downfall of the regime. A woman said she saw demonstrators running down a Tripoli street outside her window, chased by apparent mercenaries in pickup trucks. The Africans were firing at the demonstrators and throwing tear gas at them, according to the witness. Many families have closed their windows and turned off their lights out of fear, she said. Another witness said that crowds of anti-government demonstrators hit the streets and set cars on fire. Masked, armed men in SUVs drove through the streets blasting pro-government music, said the witness, claiming that the same people had been firing at protesters and passerby. Gunfire also rang out near Green Square and the presidential palace, according to multiple witnesses. Another man said that men were walking around Libya's streets with automatic rifles early Monday, firing seemingly indiscriminately. The crackdown, as well as the government's role and reaction to it, stoked the ire of many opposed to Moammar Gadhafi as well as governments outside Libya. Libya's ambassador to the Arab League said Sunday he resigned his position on Saturday over ""the killing of innocent people."" Abdel Elhuni said the protesters are asking for ""normal things"" and that Gadhafi is ""over, finished."" He speculated that the Libyan leader has only a day or two left in power because ""he lost the people."" British Foreign Secretary William Hague spoke on Sunday with Saif Gadhafi and ""made clear the U.K.'s grave concern at the escalation of violence,"" the Foreign Office said in a statement. ""He expressed alarm at reports of large numbers of people being killed or attacked by Libyan security forces. The Foreign Secretary told Mr. Gadhafi that the Libyan government's actions were unacceptable and would result in worldwide condemnation."" The United States also said it was ""gravely concerned with disturbing reports and images coming out of Libya. ""We are working to ascertain the facts, but we have received multiple credible reports that hundreds of people have been killed and injured in several days of unrest -- and the full extent of the death toll is unknown due to the lack of access of international media and human rights organizations,"" State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said in a statement. U.S. officials have communicated to Libyan officials including Libyan Foreign Minister Musa Kusa ""our strong objections to the use of lethal force against peaceful demonstrators,"" Crowley said. ""Libyan officials have stated their commitment to protecting and safeguarding the right of peaceful protest. We call upon the Libyan government to uphold that commitment and hold accountable any security officer who does not act in accordance with that commitment."" One man in Tripoli said was particularly angry at state-run TV for ""pretending that nothing is happening."" A medical staff member at Benghazi Medical Center was among those sharply critical of Saif Gadhafi's speech, calling him a liar and saying -- disputing his assertion that Libya could split into several parts if not united under his father's rule -- the nation was one. ""There are no divisions among Libyans,"" the staff member said. ""We want to be united with our brothers and sisters ... All Libyans think this way, it is the regime that lacks knowledge about the people.""

"Jerusalem (CNN)They prayed for the best but feared for the worst when a gunman stormed into a Jewish store in east Paris and unleashed terror just hours before Shabbat on Friday. Now, four days after Yoav Hattab, 21, Yohan Cohen, 22,  Philippe Braham, 45, and François-Michel Saada, 63, were shot dead at the Hyper Cacher kosher supermarket -- the final, tragic chapter to the Charlie Hebdo terror attacks in the French capital that shocked the world -- their devastated families have laid them to rest at the Givat Shaul cemetery in Jerusalem. Family members, wrapped in coats to ward off the chill on a sunny Tuesday morning, embraced each other and wept as the bodies of their loved ones arrived. They were joined by hundreds of other people, many of whom traveled from France to mourn the deadliest attack on that country's Jewish community since 2012. Some were draped in the Israeli flag; others carried signs bearing the faces of the dead and words, in French, declaring, ""I am dead because I am Jewish,"" and ""I am Charlie, I am Jewish, I am Israeli, I am French, and I've had enough."" The wife of Braham thanked the crowds that gathered to pay tribute to the fallen. ""What can I say? Philippe, my dear love. He was a perfect person, always a husband, a father who lived only for his children. Today, he is with my son. I'm crying, but I know that you all cry with me, and I thank all of you for all of this. Philippe, protect yourself, protect me."" Helicopters flew overhead and soldiers stood guard among the headstones as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the families in a speech. ""When I hugged you in Paris, I said to you that I know your hurt -- the hurt of fathers, of parents, boys and girls, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, who have lost their dearest,"" he said. ""And so, the people of Israel, the state of Israel, hug you with love in this dark day when four souls came to Jerusalem ... the final resting place of Philippe, Yohan, Yoav and François-Michel. May their souls rest in peace."" Netanyahu also called for a unified response in the face of last week's terror attacks: ""These are not only the enemies of Israel; they are the enemies of the world, and the time has come that all civilized people should come together and should uproot these enemies from amongst us."" The bodies of the four men were flown to Israel's Ben Gurion Airport,  before a convoy of ambulances carried their coffins to waiting crowds of mourners in Jerusalem. Sephardi Chief Rabbi Yitzhak Yosef led the state ceremony with a reading from the Book of Psalms, before the rending of garments, a symbolic act at Jewish funerals where mourners cut their own clothes. Tearful family members recited the mourner's kaddish as Israeli and French dignitaries helped them light candles in honor of the dead. Jonathan Saada lit a candle for his father with Nir Barkat, the mayor of Jerusalem. Braham's widow lit another with Nathan Sharansky, the chairman of the Jewish Agency. Hattab's father -- the chief rabbi of Tunis, Tunisia -- lit a candle with Joel Mergui, the Jewish Central Consistory president. Cohen's sister joined Haïm Korsia, the chief rabbi of France, in lighting one in memory of her brother. In an emotional speech, Israeli President Reuven Rivlin called on European leaders to take steps to wipe out anti-Semitism. ""We can't get away from the fact that this terror is particularly harsh on the Jewish people,"" he said. ""It would be dangerous to get away from the fact that there is anti-Semitism, (whether it's) old anti-Semitism or new anti-Semitism. It doesn't matter what the terrorists think. ""The leaders of Europe, they have to take an active part, and with a strong hand they have to ensure the security of the Jewish people in Europe. It's unacceptable that in 2015 that people of Israel are unable to wear the skullcap on the streets of Europe and that cemeteries and synagogues have to be protected and we cannot get away from it anymore."" The killings of the four hostages by Amedy Coulibaly came two days after the terrorist's associates massacred 12 people in an attack on the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris. Charlie Hebdo attacks: Who were the 17 victims? Hattab, one of seven children, was a student in Paris who traveled often to see his family in Tunisia, according to his Facebook page. ""You are the magnificent Tunisian that we will treasure forever. Rest in peace,"" Fatma Ben Hamouda wrote on the page. Cohen was a student who was working at the Hyper Cacher market. His parents were from Algeria and settled in Sarcelles in the 1960s, according to French news outlets RTL and AFP. His apparent Facebook page lists a French translation of his favorite quote by Shakespeare: ""We are such stuff as dreams are made on."" François-Michel Saada was a retired senior executive whose children live in Israel. He was married to Laurence Saada, a psychomotor therapist, for more than 30 years, according to RTL and AFP. Braham worshipped at a synagogue in the Paris suburb of Montrouge, and his children attended a Jewish school not far from where a police officer was killed last Thursday, the day before his own life was taken, allegedly by the same man, in the supermarket siege.

"DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (CNN) -- President Bush gave Tanzania's president, who played basketball as a youth, a pair of Shaquille O'Neal's shoes Sunday, along with millions of dollars to help combat disease and poverty in the east African country. President Jakaya Kikwete, next to President Bush, looks on as Bush greets a boy at a Tanzanian hospital Sunday. The gift of the American basketball icon's size-23 hightops spoke to the lighter side of Bush's visit. President Jakaya Kikwete presented gifts, too -- a stuffed leopard and lion, a Zebra skin and a wood carving for the American president who was enthusiastically welcomed on the second stop of his five-nation African tour. The Tanzanian president later artfully dodged a reporter's question on the potential that the U.S. might elect a black president, Sen. Barack Obama, whose father is Kenyan. Kikwete looked at Bush before demonstrating his political deftness, saying, ""Let him be as good a friend of Africa as President Bush has been."" But there was plenty of serious business to tend to as well, namely the signing of a compact under which the U.S. is to provide a $698 million grant to Tanzania.  Watch how Bush explained what African nations are candidates for U.S. aid » . U.S. funding is intended to help African governments buy mosquito netting and insecticide to prevent the spread of malaria. ""It breaks my heart to know that little children are dying needlessly because of a mosquito bite,"" Bush said. Bush also attended a roundtable on the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, program, which Kikwete said is saving lives and helping the African continent avert a health disaster. Bush said he has requested $30 billion over the next five years for the program. Though PEPFAR has helped increase accessibility to anti-viral drugs, the program is controversial because there is little focus on distributing condoms -- a staple of the program under President Clinton -- or on sex education, said Joel Barkan, a senior associate for the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The program is ""largely pursued through faith-based initiatives,"" he said, adding that it's not clear whether the AIDS-prevalence rates are going down. After their visit to Tanzania, the president and first lady Laura Bush will travel to Rwanda to meet with President Paul Kagame.  Watch why Bush looks to Africa as part of his legacy » . The U.S. has provided nearly 7,000 Rwandan troops with training, and spent more than $17 million to equip the troops and send them to Sudan, according to National Security adviser Stephen Hadley. Ethnic and tribal violence has raged for years in Sudan's western Darfur region, leaving about 200,000 dead and more than 2 million displaced. Arab militias, said to be backed by the Sudanese government, have wantonly attacked Africans, and numerous rebel groups have attacked government targets. ""In Darfur, the U.S. will continue to call the killing what it is -- genocide,"" Bush said last week. The Bushes will go to Ghana then Liberia after visiting Rwanda. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who is on the Africa trip, will head to Kenya on Monday to support efforts to reach political conciliation there. The country erupted in ethnic violence after a December presidential vote, in which President Mwai Kibaki kept his post. Opposition leader Raila Odinga blasted the results, saying the election was rigged. He and his supporters declined to recognize the election results. Violence has declined some since former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan began mediating between the two groups. Bush's first stop on the six-day tour was Benin, where he arrived Saturday. There, President Thomas Yayi Boni inducted Bush into the National Order of Benin and gave the American president a sash, cross medallion and lapel pin. He also thanked Bush for U.S. aid aimed at fighting poverty, malaria and HIV/AIDS, and he asked for help for Benin's struggling cotton exports. Boni said it was tough for Benin to compete with Asian cotton producers because of their superior infrastructure and with U.S. cotton growers because of government subsidies. Bush responded that the U.S. is willing to make concessions, but suggested that Benin might be better served to develop a cotton-products industry rather than trying to export raw cotton. Boni said Benin needs international help bolstering its electricity, water, communication and transportation systems before expanding its manufacturing sector. Bush said he chose Benin to start his African tour because its leaders were determined to fight corruption and were careful to make sure U.S. aid dollars were properly spent. ""The United States wants to partner with leaders and their people, but we're not going to do so with people who steal money, pure and simple,"" Bush said. The United States has given Benin $307 million in a five-year grant to fight poverty, part of Bush's Millennium Challenge Account, which provides aid to countries that practice democratic principles and sound economic policy. Bush's trip to Africa is ""basically an effort to celebrate successes,"" said Joel Barkan of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Most Americans picture Africa as the ""continent of gloom and doom,"" but the president is saying the bigger picture is one of ""making progress."" Barkan added, ""The question might be asked why he's not going to a number of countries,"" in particular the regional powers of Kenya, South Africa and Nigeria. ""If the election in Kenya had gone well,"" the analyst said, ""I'm sure Kenya would have been included. That's not possible now."" The trip marks Bush's second to the continent and his wife's fifth.

"(CNN) -- FIFA president Sepp Blatter faces an investigation by world football's governing body after being included in a probe into bribery. The 75-year-old's only opponent at the June 1 presidential election, Mohamed Bin Hammam, had called for Blatter to appear in front of the ethics committee following his own summoning to Sunday's hearing. Bin Hammam is due to be quizzed along with Jack Warner, who runs the CONCACAF federation covering Central and North America. The pair have been accused of bribery by FIFA executive committee member Chuck Blazer in relation to a meeting they held with the Caribbean Football Union (CFU) on May 10 and 11 this year. FIFA probes fresh bribery scandal . Bin Hammam, who is head of the Asian Football Confederation, denied any wrongdoing and on Thursday demanded Blatter be included in the probe after claiming he was also named in evidence handed to the ethics committee. On Friday, in relation to the allegations against him, he said it was ""obvious that they are without substance"" and claimed it all pointed to a conspiracy to discredit his bid to become president. FIFA confirmed on Friday that Blatter, who is seeking a fourth term as the ruling body's head, had a case to answer. It said Bin Hammam had claimed that Warner, a FIFA vice-president, would have told Blatter in advance about alleged cash payments to delegations attending the CFU meeting, and that he ""would have had no issue with these."" ""Subsequently, the FIFA Ethics Committee today opened a procedure against the FIFA President in compliance with article 16 of the FIFA Code of Ethics,"" the statement said. ""Joseph S. Blatter has been invited to take position by May 28, 11:00 CET and to attend a hearing by the FIFA Ethics Committee on May 29."" Blatter, who came to power in 1998, issued a brief statement refusing to comment on the situation. ""I cannot comment on the proceedings that have been opened against me today. The facts will speak for themselves,"" the Swiss said. Blatter said on Thursday he was not responsible for the investigation into Bin Hammam so close to Wednesday's election. ""To make a point very clear, let me say this: I take no joy in having to observe yet another ethics committee hearing and investigation,"" Blatter wrote in his column for the Inside World Football website. ""And I take absolutely no joy in seeing my friends and colleagues of many years dragged before the ethics committee. I take no joy to see men who stood by my side for some two decades suffer through public humiliation without having been convicted of any wrongdoing. ""To now assume that the present ordeal of my opponent were to fill me with some sort of perverse satisfaction or that this entire matter was somehow masterminded by me is ludicrous and completely reprehensible."" However, Bin Hammam claimed that the accusations were part of a plan to force him to withdraw as a candidate for the presidency. ""I am not at all afraid to answer any questions that the Ethics Committee may have for me at the hearing next Sunday. As long as the committee guarantees a fair process, I have nothing to fear,"" he told CNN. ""The accusations contain statements according to which Mr. Blatter, the incumbent FIFA president, was informed of, but did not oppose, payments allegedly made to members of the Caribbean Football Union."" Warner has also been named in allegations made by the former head of England's 2018 World Cup bid, who claimed he was asked to provide money to the Trinidadian in exchange for his vote. Warner denies the allegations. The English Football Association was due to send its report to FIFA on Friday, following claims by its former chairman David Triesman that Warner sought financial help to build an education center and asked the FA to pay for Haiti's World Cup TV rights.","FIFA to investigate its president Sepp Blatter in probe into bribery claims .

"(CNN) -- FIFA has cast doubts on the hopes of several countries bidding to host the 2018 and 2022 World Cup tournaments in a technical evaluation report released by soccer's governing body on Wednesday. Russia, seeking to host football's premier event for the first time in 2018, was criticized for its limited transport options -- which may cause problems due to ""the country's vastness and remoteness'"" the report said. Its information and communications technology needs to be upgraded, while 13 of its proposed 16 stadiums will be started from scratch and its accommodation plan suggests ""a dependence on construction and modernization in the hotel sector."" Russia received a ""low risk"" legal rating, as did its main European rivals England and Spain-Portugal, but the Belgium-Netherlands joint bid was marked ""medium risk"". England, the 1966 host, received a mainly favorable evaluation but it failed to meet FIFA's requirements for venue-specific training sites and accommodation. The Spain-Portugal bid also fell short in required contracted venue-specific training sites, but it has an advantage over England in that there are no government restrictions on media rights. The Belgium-Netherlands bid fell short in team facility and accommodation requirements, and did not supply the necessary government guarantees to satisfy FIFA's protection program needs. Of the 2022 candidates, Qatar's bid was highlighted as having the most shortfalls -- mainly due to the small size of the country, its excessively hot climate during the tournament months of June-July, and the need to start most construction from scratch. ""The fact that 10 out of the 12 stadiums are located within a 25-30 kilometer radius could represent an operational and logistical challenge,"" the report said. ""Any delay in the completion of the transport projects could impact FIFA's tournament operations. Moreover, it appears to be difficult to test a transport concept prior to the event under conditions comparable to the World Cup. ""The fact that the competition is planned in June-July, the two hottest months of the year in this region, has to be considered as a potential health risk for players, officials, the FIFA family and spectators, and requires precautions to be taken."" The Qatar bid was praised for a novel aspect to its stadium plans, which would see modular sections used to build 22 grounds around the world in developing countries. Its time-zone difference of three hours from Europe means it rated higher in terms of television revenue -- an area where rivals Australia, South Korea and Japan fell down. Australia's geographical size was also highlighted as a potential problem, while it failed to meet FIFA's accommodation requirements, but it was rated a low legal risk. The United States' size was not deemed to be problematic given the competitiveness of its air industry, but the report noted temporary transport would have to be provided to and from most of the proposed stadiums. The U.S. government did not provide the necessary guarantee, but FIFA said the country's past experience in hosting major sports events -- including the 1994 World Cup -- had proved its willingness to make material concessions"" and ""accommodate the concerns of event organizers."" The U.S. bid had the highest projected tickets sold of almost five million, and the report said ""TV ratings and media rights in the Americas are likely to be higher."" Japan and South Korea are seeking to stage the event for the second time, having been co-hosts in 2002. Japan's bid focused on innovative high-tech aspects, and was praised for its facilities and transport, though its government did not provide the required guarantees and it was rated a medium legal risk. South Korea, which hopes to stage some games in the North, met most requirements but received one black mark in that ""the majority of FIFA's constituent target groups would be accommodated in two or three-star quality standard rooms."" It was given a low legal risk rating, but FIFA said its broadcasting law ""adversely affects the free and unrestricted exploitation of media rights"" and therefore needs to be suspended. FIFA's executive committee members, who have been lobbied by all the candidates and visited their facilities, will vote to decide the hosts for both tournaments on December 2. Other factors apart from the technical requirements have historically played a part in awarding hosting rights. FIFA took the 2010 tournament to South Africa despite a lack of existing infrastructure in a bid to develop football on the continent, having done the same in the U.S. in 1994. Meanwhile, FIFA's ethics committee will announce on Thursday the fate of the two executive committee members accused of offering to sell their World Cup votes, the UK Press Association reported on Wednesday. Nigeria's Amos Adamu and Oceania president Reynald Temarii were last month provisionally suspended along with four other FIFA officials following an undercover investigation by British newspaper the Sunday Times. The ethics committee also investigated claims of illegal collusion between bid candidates at its three-day hearing in Switzerland this week.","FIFA report highlights potential problems in World Cup bids lodged by nine countries .

"(CNN) -- World football's governing body FIFA have confirmed that vice-president Jack Warner and executive committee member Mohamed bin Hammam have been provisionally suspended by the organization with immediate effect. The announcement follows an enquiry by FIFA's Ethics Committee, after alleged violations of the FIFA Code of Ethics linked to the upcoming FIFA presidential election. FIFA released a statement on Sunday saying: ""The Ethics Committee considered that a provisional suspension was required while the investigation continues, taking into account the gravity of the case and the likelihood that a breach of the FIFA Code of Ethics and the FIFA Disciplinary Code has been committed."" Former rival to FIFA president faces ethics hearing . The news, following a dramatic 24 hours which saw bin Hammam withdraw as the only challenger to Sepp Blatter in next month's presedential election, means that Blatter will be re-elected unchallenged after he was cleared of any wrong- doing by the Ethics Committee. In relation to Blatter's case, the statement added: ""Regarding the proceedings opened against FIFA president Joseph Blatter, at the request of Mohamed bin Hammam, for a potential breach of the FIFA Code of Ethics -- all charges were dismissed in full. ""The Ethics Committee found that no breach of the Code of Ethics had been committed and they will meet again in due course in order to take a final decision on the matter after gathering more information and evidence on the cases."" Blatter himself released a statement saying: ""The FIFA Ethics Committee has reached its decisions. ""I do not wish to comment in detail, but simply to say that I regret what has happened in the last few days and weeks. FIFA's image has suffered a great deal as a result,"" added the 75-year-old Swiss. Bin Hammam, 62, was a major influence in Qatar's surprising victory in winning the right to host the 2022 World Cup finals. He and Warner became a target for investigation after Chuck Blazer, general secretary of regional football body CONCACAF that covers North and Central America and the Caribbean, reported possible misdeeds during a May 10 and 11 meeting in Trinidad. The allegations concerned whether the duo had offered cash gifts to national associations in return for pro-bin Hammam votes in the presidential election.","Jack Warner and Mohamed bin Hammam provisionally suspended by FIFA .

Pakistan's Election Commission said a formal announcement would be made later Tuesday. Since the presidency is a nonpartisan role, Hussain would have to resign from the Pakistan Muslim League-N party, which Sharif leads. Hussain would succeed President Asif Ali Zardari, one of Sharif's longtime political rivals. The presidency was more powerful under Pervez Musharraf, the army general who held the office from 2001 to 2008 after he led a 1999 military coup.

Mohammed Hamzah Khan, 19, had invited his family to join him in his plans to travel to join ISIS in the Mideast, authorities said. The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria is using warfare and terror in an attempt to create an Islamic state across Sunni areas of Iraq and in Syria. The teenager's mother, Zarine Khan, condemned ISIS and accused it of using social media propaganda to brainwash Muslim youths. She cited last week's terror attacks in Paris that killed 17 people and allegedly involved a now dead suspect with ties to ISIS. ""We condemn this violence in the strongest possible terms. We condemn the brutal tactics of ISIS and groups like them. And we condemn the brainwashing and the recruiting of children through the use of social media and Internet,"" the mother told reporters while reading tearfully from a statement. ""We have a message for ISIS, Mr. Baghdadi and his fellow social media recruiters: Leave our children alone!"" Zarine Khan said, as her husband, Shafi Ullah Khan, stood beside her. She was referring to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the mysterious boss of the terror group ISIS. Her son is charged with one count of attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization. The charge he faces carries a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. He wrote that he was leaving the United States to join ISIS, according to a criminal complaint. Authorities said they found a three-page letter in the bedroom he shared with a sibling in Bolingbrook, Illinois, in which he invited his family to join him. But he warned them not to tell anyone about his travel plans, the complaint said. ""First and foremost, please make sure not to to tell the authorities,"" he wrote, according to the complaint. ""For if this were to happen it will jeopardize not only the safety of us but our family as well."" A round-trip ticket was purchased for Khan from Chicago to Istanbul, authorities said. Authorities arrested him at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago in October. Investigators searched Khan's Bolingbrook home, where he lives with his parents, and found documents allegedly written by Khan that stated his intentions. In a letter, Khan wrote that there is an obligation to ""migrate"" to ISIS-controlled territory. CNN's Bill Kirkos and George Howell contributed to this report from Chicago.

"(CNN)Republicans who want to make a play for the White House by positioning theirs as the party that can govern, in contrast to hapless Democrats, could face a significant obstacle: their governors. From New Jersey to Wisconsin to Louisiana, GOP governors with their eyes on the White House have presided over unbalanced budgets, unfunded pension liabilities, credit downgrades and sluggish job growth. That comes in contrast to an increasingly rosy economic picture nationally, with a strong December jobs report that capped off the best year in terms of economic growth for the nation since 1999. Unemployment, at 5.8 percent, was below predictions, and job growth has continued for month after month. Three of the most prominent potential 2016 contenders — New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal — could face the most scrutiny, and have the toughest time explaining, their economic records for 2016. It's a troubling prospect for the party as it prepares to offer Republicans as the ""party of solutions"" in contrast to the Democrats, which it says has offered ineffective policies that contributed to a slow recovery and increasing inequality in the nation. Charlie Black, who chaired Sen. John McCain's 2008 presidential run, said that ""the biggest problem the Democrats will have in the next election is that the economy is bad."" RELATED: Kansas tax cuts on trial amid huge budget deficit . ""It's really lack of jobs and lack of economic progress that's the biggest issue,"" he said. But reality of late hasn't borne that argument out. And he admitted that some governors may have some explaining to do. ""If you're John Kasich, you have a good story to tell — but some of the others might have a little bit more difficult story to tell. But you can always come up with the right spin on it if you work on it,"" he said. Who will have to spin the most? Establishment Republican operatives are already quietly whispering over the elephant in the room for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie — his state's economic woes. Christie came into office pledging replenish the state's pension program, but had to reverse that promise to help balance the state's budget. Pension liabilities have subsequently ballooned under his watch, topping $83 billion, according to the last report from debt ratings agency Moody's. Coupled with other budgetary shortfalls, the pension liabilities have resulted in Moody's and other agencies downgrading New Jersey's credit rating eight times — a record for a sitting governor of the state, according to the Star-Ledger. He also faces sluggish job growth. New Jersey's job growth has been slower than the national average, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the state's unemployment rate has been higher than the national average over the past year. For his part, Christie and his supporters are aggressively fighting back against the narrative that New Jersey's economy is sliding. During Tuesday's state of the state speech, the governor outlined his ""Five In Five"" record, a laundry list of mostly economic accomplishments Christie trumpets as a sign of good Republican management of the state's pocket book. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal is taking flak from both his right and his left, with critics saying at turns that he's cut too much government funding and too little. His latest budget has seen some of the steepest cuts to higher education ever proposed for the state — so steep, in fact, the Republican speaker of the Louisiana House has vowed to block block them, telling a local outlet the cuts ""would set us back generations."" Jindal and his allies, however, say they've needed to enact steep cuts to balance the state's budget. But even conservatives are dissatisfied, noting that to achieve a balanced budget, the governor has had to rely heavily on a non-replenishable pool of ""onetime"" funds that won't be available next year. ""It's frustrated many of us because it does go against what we typically say, and that is, we should not spend more money that's coming in,"" Louisiana state Rep. Brett Geyman, a fiscally conservative Republican, said of Jindal's budgets in an interview. ""We face a very large shortfall as we go into the spring session of 2015 because we've been relying too much on those onetime funds for recurring expenses."" Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker may also have to face scrutiny of a record that oversaw slower than national average job and wage growth, according to an analysis from PolitiFact. His office pushed back on the analysis, noting that the current 5.2 unemployment rate for the state is down from 7.8 when Walker came into office. Democrats also point to the fact that job growth was uneven across low, middle and high-wage sectors — with middle-wage jobs, key to the stability of the middle class, declining during the recession, according to an analysis from University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee professor Marc Levine — as evidence Walker hasn't done enough for the middle class. And the state faces a $2.2 billion budget deficit heading into the new year. A Walker aide said, however, that's a flawed prediction based on preliminary budget proposals, and that Walker will balance the final budget. ""We will fund priorities and provide necessary services at a good value to taxpayers,"" said spokeswoman Laurel Patrick. And Walker himself sought to paint a rosy picture of his state's fiscal health during his State of the State speech Tuesday night. ""We finished each year with a surplus, and we will again this year,"" Walker said. ""Wisconsin's pension system is the only one fully funded in the country. The state's pension and debt ratio is one of the best. Our bond rating is positive. And the rainy day fund is the largest in state history — 165 times bigger than when we first took office."" Ted Strickland, president of the progressive Center for American Progress Action Fund and a former governor of Ohio, said he believes once the public begins ""looking below the surface"" of their records, ""you'll find there's a lot of smoke and mirrors going on with the claims they're making."" ""In my judgment, they are so tied to an extreme ideology that they don't want to be confronted by the facts and the truth about what their approach, their trickle-down approach leads to: Greater deficits, a weaker economy, and greater inequality,"" he said. But Jindal, Christie and Walker all have accomplishments to tout as well. Christie has had to deal with a Democratic legislature that's often worked to block his legislative priorities; Louisiana has become more business-friendly under Jindal's watch, according to a number of nonpartisan rankings; and Walker's union-breaking efforts were lauded as a model for other states nationwide. But strategists say they won't be able to run from the blemishes on their records. Ryan Williams, a spokesman for Mitt Romney's 2012 bid, said that every bit of the GOP presidential contender's record as governor of Massachusetts became susceptible to scrutiny when he ran. ""It's all fair game for your opposition — given that you are the executive of your state,"" he said. ""When you're a governor running for president — you have to own whatever the pluses and minuses are for your state's economic record,"" he said. Some GOP governors have better records than others. Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who's contemplating another presidential run, travelled to other states, touting the Texas economy and trying to woo businesses with low tax rates. He could make his state's  economy a key pillar of a 2016 campaign. And some states governed by Democrats, like Illinois, have seen their share of economic struggles. But Democrats are hoping to make even some of those governors that aren't running a problem for Republicans. They've pointed to Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback, whose promised conservative ""experiment"" of implementing steep tax and spending cuts has crippled the state's economy, as evidence the conservative vision of governance doesn't work. Strickland decried what he called an ""exaggerated pursuit of the trickle-down agenda,"" in Kansas, ""where taxes were cut for the wealthy and the economy is in shambles."" ""That's an example, I think, of what Republicans are capable of doing if they were to win the presidency,"" he said. Some Republicans believe Brownback's labors will eventually bear fruit. Grover Norquist, president of the conservative anti-tax group Americans for Tax Reform, lauded Brownback's move and said he should jump in the race for 2016. ""There isn't a problem in front of Sam Brownback and the Republicans in Kansas that they can't fix,"" he said. ""I think he should run for president — he's radical, different, unexpected."" But there's a growing chorus of voices within the GOP calling for a more moderate economic vision going forward. Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder has expressed an openness to a new gas tax, while Gov. John Kasich has floated a tax on oil and gas companies to pay for an income tax cut. It's that tension — between the moderate economic visions of purple-state governors and those of their red-state brothers — that could cause further complications for the GOP in a presidential primary fight, where they'll have to debate the benefits of both approaches on a national stage. Stan Veuger, an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said in an interview that ""Democrats have some totally reasonable points"" on the economy. ""It's not the case that if you cut tax rates, revenue is going to go up immediately,"" he noted, calling such a suggestion ""ludicrous."" He suggested the best solution for Republican governors was to take the middle road — and perhaps use Brownback as a cautionary tale. A Republican governor with a struggling state economy could say, ""I'm a solid conservative governor with an eye to the deficit and the debt, but I'm not going to take crazy stances in any direction,"" Veuger proposed. Congress is getting richer .","Some Republicans mulling White House runs will have to defend struggling economies in their states .

"Ottawa (CNN)A third Canadian man arrested this week on terrorism-related charges will remain in custody after making a brief court appearance Tuesday. Suliman Mohamed, 21, stood watching the court proceedings before being remanded into custody. He wore a brown-colored, hooded jacket and was carefully watched by his parents, sitting in the front row. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police announced Mohamed's arrest Monday, charging him with participating in the activity of a terrorist group and conspiracy to participate in terrorist activity. Federal prosecutor Roderick Sonley indicated Tuesday that the government would disclose more details of evidence against Mohamed before his next court date, set for February 12. Outside the Ottawa courthouse, Mohamed's father defended his son, saying he was a devout Muslim and not a radical. ""My son is not involved in this at all,"" Idris Altahir said. ""He's a very normal person, quiet, polite and generous."" Police allege Mohamed's terrorist activity was directly linked to the arrests of Ashton and Carlos Larmond, two Ottawa twin brothers accused of conspiring to commit terrorism offenses. ""My son doesn't participate in these things, but we're going to see the evidence, what they have,"" Altahir said. After an investigation dating back to at least August, the Larmond brothers, both 24, were arrested Friday in two different locations. Ashton Larmond was arrested in Ottawa, but his brother Carlos was arrested at Montreal's Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport, where police allege he was intending to travel overseas for terrorist purposes. Carlos Larmond was charged with participation in the activity of a terrorist group but also with attempting to leave Canada to participate in terrorist activity abroad, a relatively new Canadian terrorism law. Through their attorney, the brothers indicated they would be fighting the charges. To date, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police have released few details.","Suliman Mohamed makes court appearance after arrest on terror-related charges .

"An uncle of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has been executed for trying to overthrow the government, the Korean Central News Agency reported early Friday. ""Traitor Jang Song Thaek Executed"" blared the headline posted by the state-run news agency about the man who, until recently, had been regarded as the nation's second-most powerful figure. The story said that a special military tribunal had been held Thursday against the ""traitor for all ages,"" who was accused of trying to overthrow the state ""by all sorts of intrigues and despicable methods."" It added, ""All the crimes committed by the accused were proved in the course of hearing and were admitted by him."" Once his guilt was established, Jang was immediately executed, it said. The KCNA report described Jang as ""despicable human scum"" and ""worse than a dog,"" and said he had betrayed his party and leader. ""This is a stunning development,"" Marcus Noland, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told CNN on Thursday. ""I've been following North Korea for 20 years and I do not remember them ever publicly announcing the execution of a senior leader. You hear rumors about it, but this theatrical arrest earlier in the week and now this execution are unprecedented."" He added, ""The regime, I think, is trying to intimidate anyone that might have independent ideas or harbor any ambitions."" KCNA's report comes days after Jang was removed from his military post. Jang, who was married to Kim's aunt, had served as vice chairman of North Korea's top military body and had often been pictured beside the 30-year-old leader, who has ruled North Korea since the death in 2011 of his father, Kim Jong Il. It has previously been reported that Kim Il Sung -- the late father of Kim Jong Il and the architect of the North Korean state -- disapproved of Jang's marriage into the family, according to Time Magazine. In Washington, a State Department official acknowledged having seen the report of Jang's execution. ""While we cannot independently verify this development, we have no reason to doubt the official KCNA report,"" Deputy Spokeswoman Marie Harf said in a statement. ""If confirmed, this is another example of the extreme brutality of the North Korean regime.  We are following developments in North Korea closely and consulting with our allies and partners in the region,"" Harf added. ""I think the message to people in North Korea is: Don't mess with Kim Jong Un,"" said Mike Chinoy, a senior fellow at the U.S.-China Institute at the University of Southern California and author of ""Meltdown: The Inside Story of the North Korean Nuclear Crisis."" ""This is about as brutal and ruthless a signal that could possibly be conveyed -- that Kim Jong Un is in charge and that anybody who seeks to create any kind of alternative power center is going to get destroyed politically and, in the case of Jang Song Thaek, physically as well."" He called the incident ""the most dramatic, highly visible shakeup in the North Korean leadership in decades."" Kim accused Jang and his allies of double-dealing behind the scenes, ""dreaming different dreams"" and selling the country's resources at cheap prices, thereby threatening North Korea's economic development, according to a KCNA statement this week. ""Jang desperately worked to form a faction within the party by creating illusion about him and winning those weak in faith and flatterers to his side,"" the statement said. The statement accused Jang of womanizing, drug use, gambling, eating at expensive restaurants and undergoing medical treatment in a foreign country. Friday's KCNA report accused Jang of having distributed pornographic pictures among his confidants and having taken at least 4.6 million euros (US $6.3 million) ""from his secret coffers and squandered it in 2009 alone."" How does North Korea make money? Two allies of Jang -- Lee Yong-ha and Jang Soo-kee -- were recently executed, South Korean lawmakers told reporters prior to Friday's report. The lawmakers, including Cho Won-jin of the governing Saenuri Party, said they had received a briefing from South Korea's National Intelligence Service. CNN has not been able to independently confirm the report. North Korea, a state shrouded in secrecy, has been involved in a protracted standoff with its neighbors and Western powers over its nuclear weapons program. Tensions between North Korea and South Korea soared this year as Pyongyang reacted angrily to tightened United Nations sanctions imposed in response to its latest nuclear test. The two sides are still technically at war after the Korean conflict, which began in 1950 and ended in 1953 in a truce, not a treaty. The South Korean government held a national security meeting on Friday morning and was keeping a close eye on events in the north, Unification Ministry spokesman Kim Eui-do told reporters. On a separate note, Seoul has accepted a proposal from Pyongyang to meet on December 19 in the Kaesong North-South Korea Industrial Complex, the spokesman said. The execution may have repercussions among the security and military forces as well as in the economy, since Jang was well-connected in those areas, USC's Chinoy said. ""All those people now are either going to have to make very visible that they're abandoning that previous connection and that they're going to show total loyalty to Kim Jong Un, or they're going to be in trouble."" But it's not clear what, if anything, the incident may portend, he added. ""It raises a lot more questions than answers."" For example, the killing could affect Pyongyang's relationship with Beijing, since Jang had dealt extensively with China -- North Korea's biggest and most important neighbor and supplier of food and aid, said Chinoy, who was a CNN correspondent. ""I think the Chinese saw him as a sober, adult supervisor"" of the untested young leader, he said. And Pyongyang's denunciation of Jang -- which implied he had had dubious connections with an outside power -- was likely referring to China, whose leaders may now be ""deeply unsettled,"" Chinoy said. The incident could have even wider repercussions, Chinoy said. If there is a sense of instability inside North Korea, with top-level people getting killed and others at risk, ""there's always the temptation to strike out externally,"" Chinoy said.

"An American explorer's claim to have found the long-lost Santa Maria, Christopher Columbus' flagship from his first voyage to the Americas, has been dismissed by a group of U.N. experts. Underwater explorer Barry Clifford made headlines when he said in May that he believed a shipwreck on a reef off Haiti's northern coast could be the fabled ship, which went down in 1492. But a team from the U.N. cultural agency UNESCO said in a report Monday that bronze or copper fasteners found at the site point to shipbuilding techniques of the late 17th or 18th centuries, when ships were covered in copper. Before that, fasteners were made only of wood or iron, it said. ""There is now incontestable proof that the wreck is from a much later period,"" according to the report by mission leader Xavier Nieto Prieto, who visited the site for several days beginning September 9. The experts also believe that contemporary accounts, including Columbus' own journal, indicate that the wreck is too far from the shore to be that of the Santa Maria. The UNESCO mission was requested by the Haitian government to check out Clifford's claim to have solved a 500-year-old mystery. Clifford told CNN in May that he was ""very confident"" that his team had discovered the wreck of a ship he described as having ""changed the course of human history."" He believed the site had been looted since he first uncovered it in 2003. The Santa Maria was the flagship of Columbus' small fleet that set sail from Spain in August 1492 under the sponsorship of King Ferdinand II and Queen Isabella I. The voyage aimed to find a westward route to China, India and the gold and spice islands of the East. But the land the sailors set eyes on in October 1492 was an island in the Caribbean. Among the islands on which Columbus set foot was Hispaniola, which is divided between Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Columbus established a fort in Haiti. That December, the Santa Maria accidentally ran aground off the island's coast. Some planks and provisions from the wrecked ship, which was about 117 feet (36 meters) long, were used by the garrison at the fort, according to Encyclopaedia Britannica. Columbus set off back to Spain with the two remaining ships, the Nina and the Pinta, in January 1493. The UNESCO report called for further investigations to find the Santa Maria and urged Haiti to take steps to ensure that its underwater heritage is protected in line with U.N. conventions.","U.N. experts say a wreck found off Haiti is not that of the long-lost Santa Maria .

"New York (CNN) -- The iconic World Trade Center cross --  two intersecting steel beams that held up when the Twin Towers collapsed on September 11, 2001 -- was moved Saturday to its new home at the nearby 9/11 Memorial and Museum. Recovery workers and their families were among those invited to attend a ceremonial blessing before the cross, which was uncovered in the rubble of the collapsed buildings. The service was led by Father Brian Jordan, a Franciscan monk who ministered to workers clearing the area after the 9/11 attacks. ""After a 10-year journey of faith, the World Trade Center Cross has finally found its home,"" Jordan said, according to a news release from organizers of the event. ""I am grateful to the leadership of the Memorial Museum for their sensitivity, compassion and professionalism. I urge all those who believe in the consolation and power of the Cross to visit it in its future home in the Memorial Museum."" Joe Daniels, 9/11 Memorial president, said the cross is ""an important part of our commitment to bring back the authentic physical reminders that tell the history of 9/11 in a way nothing else could. ""Its return is a symbol of the progress on the Memorial & Museum that we feel rather than see, reminding us that commemoration is at the heart of our mission."" This September 11 will mark the 10th anniversary of the attacks, and the memorial will be dedicated that day.  It will open to the public the following day.

"New York (CNN) -- The first 13 rules of basketball sold Friday for more than $4 million, setting a record for the highest sales price for sports memorabilia, according to Sotheby's, which conducted the auction. The auction house had estimated that Dr. James Naismith's two-page ""Founding Rules of Basketball"" would bring less than half the $4,338,500 that David and Suzanne Booth bid for the 119-year-old document. ""This is the birth certificate. It started here,"" said Selby Kiffer, Sotheby's vice president for manuscripts and books department. Naismith, a Canadian physical education instructor working at a New England YMCA, created the game of ""Basket Ball"" so students could play a sport indoors in winter. Naismith had no idea his invention would catch on so rapidly after the YMCA movement introduced it on an international level. But the game has changed considerably since Naismith's days. Naismith wanted the game to have no physical contact between players and to encourage sportsmanship. How far it's come: After a recent pickup game, President Barack Obama received 12 stitches on his lip, proving that the contemporary game of basketball is tougher than it was in 1891. The first game was played with nine players on each team and a soccer ball they lobbed into peach baskets secured about 10 feet off the floor on either end of a gymnasium. Players could only pass the ball, no dribbling. A foul was called for carrying the ball, holding it against the body or hitting it with a fist or for any physical contact with an opposing player. And contact with an opposing player with ""evident intent to injure the person"" resulted in the offending player being ""disqualified"" for the rest of the game, with no substitution. The Booths hope to bring Naismith's rules to the University of Kansas, inspired, they said, by lifelong Jayhawk basketball fan Josh Swade and his campaign to return the rules the university, where Naismith spent the last 41 years of his life and is buried. David Booth, a billionaire who is chairman and co-CEO of a Texas mutual fund company, said the purchase is a ""challenge to the University of Kansas."" ""As soon as they create a venue to house it and persuade us that they will maintain it, we will give them the papers,"" said Booth, who has an undergraduate degree from the school. ""In the meantime, we will keep them in a vault."" Booth, who said college basketball is his favorite sport, said the $4 million-plus he is spending for the rules is ""absolutely worth it."" ""It is an incredibly important document,"" he said. ""I am donating it because it is the right thing to do."" Naismith ""invented the game, and so these papers should be there,"" he said. ""I hope there is enough support at KU that they really want it."" Naismith came to Kansas in 1898 after earning a medical degree in Colorado. He coached the first Kansas basketball teams and later became the school's athletic director. He coached the legendary Forrest ""Phog"" Allen, who succeeded Naismith as Kansas coach in 1920, remaining at the helm through 36 years and three national championships. At Kansas, Allen, in turn, coached other legendary basketballers: Dean Smith, head coach at the University of North Carolina for 36 years, and Adolph Rupp, head coach at the University of Kentucky for 42 years. Ironically, Naismith is the only Kansas basketball coach to compile a losing record. After Naismith's death in 1939, the family held onto the 13 rules of the game in a safe deposit box at various locations. In that time, basketball has become one of the biggest businesses in sports. Players earn millions of dollars in salaries. ""The greed factor is getting quite strong. People are making an awful lot of money in the game and have a tendency to lose, in our opinion, the values,"" said Ian Naismith, the founder's youngest grandson. The family has always been involved in the game of basketball, but after many offers, it is ""time to move forward,"" said Naismith, now living outside Chicago. CNN invited Sotheby's to bring the rules Thursday to New York's Madison Square Garden, where the New York Knicks were preparing to take on the Charlotte Bobcats. ""They're cool,"" exclaimed Knicks coach Mike D'Antoni. ""It's a game that's been awfully good to me and a lot of other people. So the rules are special,"" said former Knicks coach Larry Brown, now with the Bobcats. The proceeds from the auction will go to the James Naismith International Basketball Foundation. The humanitarian foundation promotes Naismith's legacy of encouraging good sportsmanship, positive role models, higher education and services for underprivileged children.

"(CNN) -- It's a bright May morning and the purple-shirted army of tricycle drivers is on the streets of Lagos once again. Eyes trained ahead, they zip past traffic on their specially-modified vehicles, dipping in and out of the Nigerian megacity's slums. This is the mobile division of Wecyclers, an innovative enterprise using an incentive-based program to help solve Lagos's acute waste management problem. Every week, the company's cyclists peddle from door to door in low-income neighborhoods to pick up recyclable trash from registered households. Items like plastic bottles, aluminum cans and plastic sachets are all weighed and logged on site, and from there are taken to a specific sorting area where they're bagged in order to be sold to recycling factories. In return, participating households receive points via SMS. These can eventually be exchanged for rewards, mainly donated items ranging from bowls and blenders to food products and mobile phone air time. ""Every three months they have opportunity to redeem the points for something,"" says Weclycers chief executive Bilikiss Adebiyi-Abiola. ""So we give them really small gifts that just motivate them and encourage them to recycle."" Lagos, a sprawling megacity of more than 18 million people, generates a massive 10,000 metric tons of waste daily, according to the city's waste management authority. Only 40% of it is believed to be formally collected, leaving large quantities of rubbish blocking gutters and piling up on streets and outside houses -- a major health and environmental hazard. ""Low income communities are the ones that are more affected,"" says Adebiyi-Abiola. ""(People) end up living in their waste, so we basically saw that there was a really big need to provide collection services for people that are living in the low-income areas."" Born and bred in Lagos, Adebiyi-Abiola went to the United States at the age of 17. There, she trained and worked as a computer scientist, before enrolling to MIT for a masters in business administration. It was during that time, while working on a study project focused on the problems faced by people in low-income areas, when she came up with the idea to launch a company offering waste collection and recycling services in her hometown. ""I really love Lagos and I wanted to do something that would give back to it,"" says Adebiyi-Abiola. ""For me, the environment is really where it all starts,"" she adds. ""When you have a clean environment then you have health, when you have health then you can start thinking about money, jobs and things like that."" Set up just a year and a half ago, Wecyclers has grown today to have some 5,000 households subscribed to its service. The startup has so far collected nearly 300 tons of waste, using a fleet of 16 low-cost cargo bicycles that are creatively designed to transport large cloth sacks of trash. In regards to recycling as a business, however, there are still many challenges faced by Wecyclers, which is yet to make a profit. ""We hope that as we grow and add value to the material we sell, then we hope to see profits come in,"" says Adebiyi-Abiola, who employs 31 people. Despite the problems, the entrepreneur has big plans for the future. She says she's determined to keep on working to expand the service across Lagos and beyond and ultimately help to change people's attitudes toward waste. ""I want to show the whole world that this is something that can succeed,"" says Adebiyi-Abiola. ""That we can create a low-cost way of solving the Nigerian problems, the Lagos problems, here, with Lagos solutions,"" she adds. ""To show that we can have ingenuity and innovation here and almost create a movement around waste and make people realize the importance of recycling and the environment -- I'm already seeing that but I want to see it on a really big scale all across Nigeria.""","Bilikiss Adebiyi-Abiola is the co-founder and CEO of Lagos-based startup Wecyclers .

"(CNN) -- An important hydroelectric dam shared by Brazil and Paraguay failed Tuesday night, pushing a large swath of central and southern Brazil into darkness, said the country's minister of mines and energy, Edison Lobao. At about 10:30 p.m. (7:30 p.m. ET), the Itaipu dam shut down completely, Lobao said in a radio interview. Power began to slowly return Tuesday night, and authorities expected a restoration of power overnight, Lobao said. An official at Brazil's National Electric System Operator told CNN that the incident at Itaipu caused an outage of 18,000 megawatts.
