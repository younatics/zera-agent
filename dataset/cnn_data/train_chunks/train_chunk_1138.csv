"George Zimmerman accused the Sanford police department of corruption more than a year before he shot Trayvon Martin, and said that he observed officers being so lazy it was ‘disgusting’ when he went on ride-alongs with the department. The Sanford Police Department was embroiled in a scandal a year before Zimmerman shot and killed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, and during that time Zimmerman attended a public hearing as an outraged citizen. He used that forum to criticize the department after the agency covered up the beating of a black homeless man by the son of a white officer. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . On tape: Newly-released surveillance footage from the inside of the Sanford police station shows George Zimmerman walking around unattended at an earlier date than the Martin shooting . Case: The prosecution will argue that this footage shows a 'cozy' attitude he held with the police and how he felt comfortable to wander around unattended . In the speech, Zimmerman said he witnessed 'disgusting' behavior by officers when he was part of a ride-along program, though the agency said it did not know when, if ever, Zimmerman was in that program. 'The officer showed me his favorite hiding spots for taking naps. He explained to me he doesn't carry a long gun in his vehicle because in his words, `Anything that requires a long gun requires a lot of paperwork and you're gonna find me as far away from it.'' Zimmerman also said the officer in question 'took two lunch breaks and attended a going away party for one of his fellow officers.' 'I would just like to state that the law is written in black and white,' Zimmerman said during a 90-second statement to city commissioners at a community forum. 'It should not and cannot be enforced in the gray for those who are in the thin blue line.' The forum took place on January 8, 2011, days after a video of the beating went viral on the Internet and then-Sanford Police Chief Brian Tooley was forced to retire. In his favor: Public opinion has shifted so that now 40 per cent of Americans believe George Zimmerman acted in self defense, which is up from only 15 per cent who believe such in March . Tooley's department faced criticism for dragging its feet in arresting Justin Collison, the son of a police lieutenant. 'I'd like to know what action the commission is taking in order to repeal Mr. Tooley's pension,' Zimmerman said to the commission. 'I'm not asking you to repeal his pension; I believe he's already forfeited his pension by his illegal cover-up in corruption in what happened in his department.' Zimmerman's public comments could be important for his defense because the Martin family and supporters contend the neighborhood watch volunteer singled Martin out because he was black. These comments could be used to lessen the prosecution’s argument that Zimmerman is racist. The Miami Herald first reported details from the January 2011 community forum Wednesday. The Associated Press obtained a copy of the tape from the meeting. Final picture: As part of the ongoing court preparations, George Zimmerman's team submitted photos last week of Trayvon caught on the convenience store's camera . While the public forum may be helpful for his case, there is also new surveillance footage from inside the police station on a different date which shows Zimmerman walking through the police department unattended. Benjamin Crump, one of the lawyers hired by the Martin family, contends that the footage shows that Zimmerman had a ‘cozy’ and ‘comfortable’ relationship with the police, which attributed to his quick release on the night of the shooting. Zimmerman is free on bond awaiting his second-degree murder trial for shooting Martin. Martin was walking back to a townhome he was staying at when he got into a fight with Zimmerman, who shot him in the chest at close range. Preparations: Both sides are submitting evidence in the coming days as Zimmerman is in hiding . Zimmerman, who claims the February 26 shooting of Martin was self-defense, was initially not arrested. But after protests around the country and an investigation by a state prosecutor, he was charged. Tooley's successor, Bill Lee, temporarily resigned his post following a no-confidence vote by city commissioners. Lee offered to resign permanently, but his commissioners turned down his request. He is on paid leave.

"A mob of protesters set fire to the wooden door of Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto's ceremonial palace in Mexico City yesterday - denouncing the massacre of 43 trainee students. Armed with torches, the group broke away from what had been a mostly peaceful protest demanding justice for the trainee teachers - abducted six weeks ago before being shot and incinerated by corrupt police in league with Cartel members. Yesterday, three suspects told police investigating the slaughter that they layered their victims, many still alive at the time, 'like a grill' before bathing them in gasoline and setting them alight. Scroll down for video . A mob of protesters set fire to the wooden door of Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto's ceremonial palace in Mexico City yesterday . At the Presidential Palace last night police put out out the flames and enforced fencing designed to keep the protesters away from the building - which was built for Hernan Cortes after the Spanish conquest and now houses Mexico's finance ministry. Pena Nieto lives in a presidential residence across town and was not in the palace at the time. In recent weeks tens of thousands of others in have taken to the streets of Mexico City and the southwestern state of Guerrero, where the students were abducted, to condemn the government's handling of the case. It the toughest challenge yet to face President Pena Nieto, who took office two years ago vowing to restore order in Mexico, where around 100,000 people have died in violence linked to organized crime since 2007. The group, carrying torches, broke away from what had been a mostly peaceful protest demanding justice for the trainee teachers . Demostrators tear down the barricades in front of the main entrance of the Mexican National Palace in Mexico City last night . At least two people were injured in last night's protest, local television reported. Riot police cleared the square before midnight and an ambulance was assisting the injured people. Police have now released footage of the the suspects using twigs and trash bags to explain candidly how they layered the victims 'like a grill' before soaking them in petrol and setting them on fire. Their voices are cold and unemotional as officers follow them through the rubbish dump where every single victim was shot, killed and dumped in a river near Iguala in Guerrero State. Gestering in handcuffs, one in a high visibility jacket is sat in the police station as he confirms reports that the students were targeted en route to protesting at a speech made by Mayor Jose Luis Abarca's wife. Abarca allegedly demanded that the students be 'taught a lesson' so they didn't interrupt the event. He tells investigators: 'They came in the biggest truck. They asked them who they were, and they all responded that they were students. This image released by Mexico's Attorney General's office shows the former mayor of the town of Iguala, Jose Luis Abarca, left, and his wife, Maria de los Angeles Pineda, after their arrest in Mexico City . Jose Luis Abarca, left and his wife Maria de Los Angeles Pineda are believed to have links to the drug cartel . A masked demostrator waves a Mexican flag at the main entrance of the Mexican National Palace last night . 'So they took them down and asked them why they had come to Iguala, and they said they had come for Abarca's wife.' Another takes the investigators to the scene, using plastic bags as props. He dumps one on the dirt, saying: 'They let them drop like that. The students stood up and then they would walk like this [bending with his hands behind his head].' The alleged gang member shows how they were then pushed to the ground and shot. Those that died instantly were then dragged by their hands or legs into one pile and the living into another. Brazenly, one suspect then mimes how all the victims were swung into a landfill one at a time by two gang members. 'The bodies would roll until they reached the flat part,' a third suspect chilling recounted in a monotonous voice. Chilling: This is one of three gangs members who walked investigators through the brutal alleged massacre of 43 students near Iguala, in Mexico's Guerrero State. He used a twig to show how the bodies were stacked . Unemotional: Another suspect sat handcuffed in the police station mimes swinging the bodies one by one . Cover up: A third leads the detectives down to the river by San Juan bridge where the bodies were dumped . Nearby, they built a circle of rocks and put tires in the middle, he explains. On top of the tires, they put firewood - all 43 bodies were then layered on. 'In the beginning, the bodies would be placed like this,' he said, scratching lines into the ground using a stick.'Like a grill'. A second layer of victims would then be placed over them at a perpendicular angle, followed by another layer - 'until all the bodies fit'. Two members - named as El Huassaco and El Deva - stood at either end of the pile and 'bathed the grill of bodies with diesel and gasoline'. Desperate to hide all trace of their victims, the men were then scrambled to find bottles and plastic to put on the fire to stop it from extinguishing. They left with the fire still burning and came back to clean with trash bags and bottles to pick up the charcoal and bones, the suspects said. Demonstrators march holding images of the missing students - massacred to be 'taught a lesson' by Mayor Jose Luis Abarca's wife . When their truck arrived at the San Juan bridge a gang leader identified as 'El Turco' allegedly told the group to deposit the bags, making small holes in them so the remains were lost in the water. So far, 19 mass graves have been discovered around Iguala and 74 people have been arrested. The 43 students have not been seen since they disappeared near the southern city of Iguala on September 26 after being attacked by police. Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam said: 'The high level of degradation caused by the fire in the remains make it very difficult to extract the DNA that will allow an identification.' The bone fragments are being sent to Austria to a specialist laboratory for DNA testing. Police allegedly handed the students over to the Guerreros Unidos cartel who are believed to have killed them and disposed of their bodies. Murillo Karam said there is no evidence the students were involved in organized crime. The 43 students, pictured, went missing as they travelled to a protest in Iguala, Guerrero State, September 26 . Authorities say it started when police, under orders of then Iguala Mayor Jose Luis Abarca, opened fire on students who were in Iguala collecting donations and had commandeered public buses. Six people were killed in two confrontations before the 43 students were taken away and allegedly handed over to Guerreros Unidos. Jose Luis Abarca, who was previously mayor of Iguala, and his wife Maria de los Angeles Pineda were found and arrested in Mexico City on Monday. They are accused of organising the alleged massacre. Concerned that the group were about to disrupt a speech to be given by his politically ambitious wife, Abarca ordered police to 'teach them a lesson' according to Mexican media reports. Demonstrators throw stones as they attack the Guerrero State Government Palace building yesterday . Demonstrators - pictures turning over a car in Guerrero state - are angry at the way the investigations in this case have been conducted . Pineda, believed to be top of the criminal underworld tree in Iguala. demanded that police arrest the students. It was thought her speech may have been her announcement of her desire to succeed her husband as mayor. What's worse, the students had no intention of disrupting Pineda's speech, but were merely travelling through the town on buses they'd hired to take them to Mexico City for a remembrance service in honour of students massacred there in 1968. He admitted that many of the bodies had been badly burned which will make the process of extracting DNA more difficult. He said: 'I have to identify, to do everything in my power, to identify, to know if these were the students.' Students from the Ayotzinapa school run from a burning car during a protest yesterday . Some parents of the missing students do not believe that their children are among the dead. Mario Cesar Gonzalez told CNN: 'We are not going to believe anything until the experts tell us: You know what? It is them.' Isrrael Galindo, claimed: 'The government is trying to resolve things its way so that to rid itself of this great problem it is facing. My son is alive. My son is alive. My son is alive.' The victims were mostly in their 20s studying to be teachers when they planned to travel to Iguala on September 26 for a demonstration. Amnesty International has criticised the Attorney General over his handling of the case. Residents have held demonstrations calling for a full investigation into the fate of the 43 missing students . Erika Guevara Rosas, Americas Director of Amnesty International said: 'Tragically, the enforced disappearance of these student teachers is just the latest in a long line of horrors to have befallen Guerrero state, and the rest of the country. 'The warning signs of corruption and violence have been there for all to see for years, and those that negligently ignored them are themselves complicit in this tragedy.' Amnesty said the mayor of Iguala has long been suspected of criminality and links to drugs cartels. Ms Guevara Rosas said: 'If the allegations against Iguala’s mayor and the federal and local police had been investigated when other serious human rights violations occurred, it is more than likely that the terrible murders and enforced disappearances of the students would not have taken place.'","Protesters set entrance of President Enrique Pena Nieto's ceremonial palace alight in Mexico City last night .

"The mother of a developmentally disabled girl has filed a legal claim against her daughter's former special education teacher for allegedly putting the child in a gated enclosure that the mother said amounted to a cage. Ledelldra Brooks told The Fresno Bee she found her 7-year-old daughter wearing a dirty diaper inside the pen made from a toddler gate and a crib gate attached to bookshelves when she showed up unannounced at the girl's first grade classroom at Viking Elementary School in Fresno in May. Brooks called the police, who dismantled the unit and referred the results of their investigation to the district attorney as a possible case of misdemeanor child abuse. The mother of a developmentally disabled girl claims her daughter's former special education teacher put the child in a gated enclosure that the mother said amounted to a cage . 'I honestly want the public to know what's going on behind special education, what went on in my daughter's class,' she told The Bee. Teacher's aides told police the girl was one of seven students in the class and that children were put in the gated enclosure when they were out of control or posed a risk to themselves or their classmates, according to records obtained by Brooks' lawyer and reviewed by the newspaper. They said Brooks' daughter ended up there the day her mother saw her for being disruptive and scratching an aide. Viking Elementary Principal Christie Yang told officers the secured area was installed about three years ago as a safety precaution and that she had seen students inside it before Brooks expressed her outrage. Joseph Bowling, executive director of the board that oversees the San Joaquin Valley on behalf of the State Council on Developmental Disabilities, said he was extremely troubled to learn about Brooks' allegations. Isolating disabled children is never appropriate and there are more effective ways of soothing them, he said. 'This is not something I would put a child into and claim this is for their own protection. It's a cage, this is what you would put a wild animal in,' he said. 'I can't believe that somebody, an administrator walking in that room and seeing it, would allow that.' Fresno Unified School District officials have searched other special education classrooms for similar enclosures, but district spokeswoman Micheline Golden would not say whether any were found or whether new training policies for employees who work with special education students had been implemented, the Bee said. She said the district could not comment on a pending legal case. 'Fresno Unified is committed to providing the best education possible for our special education students and being their advocates,' Golden said.","Ledelldra Brooks says she found her 7-year-old daughter wearing a dirty diaper inside the pen made from a toddler gate and a crib gate attached to bookshelves .

"Oprah doesn't like first lady Michelle Obama because she's a show off Edward Klein's new book, Blood Feud, alleges. The legendary talk show host was once a close friend and adviser of the president's, but she had a falling out with the first family during the president's first term in office. 'It appeared to Oprah that Michelle was . jealous of her, furious that Barack was seeking her advice instead of . Michelle's,' a source close to Winfrey told Klein. The other woman: Oprah, pictured here in May, thinks Michelle Obama doesn't like her because the president takes Oprah's advice over his wife's, a source close to Oprah told Blood Feud author Edward Klein . 'For her part, Oprah didn't like being with Michelle, because . the first lady was constantly one-upping the president and anybody else . around her. ' At another point in the book Oprah is quoted as saying that the Obamas make her 'jumpy.' Oprah reportedly told a friend that ' ""even when the Obamas think they are being . charming, they hold you at arm’s length."" ' Obama had no stronger ally than Oprah throughout his first campaign for president, including the time he was competing against Hillary Clinton for the Democratic Party nomination. Winfrey, who is oft labeled as the most influential woman in the world, is credited with securing both the party nomination and the presidency for Obama, attracting a million votes or more for her candidate in the general election, according to two economists. Oprah lent not only her credibility to Barack Obama's campaign, endorsing the Illinois Senator's candidacy before he officially announced his intentions to seek higher office, she barnstormed the country headlining rallies and fundraisers for Barack. The night Obama accepted the Democratic nomination in 2008, Oprah gushed to reporters, 'I've never experienced anything like that.' 'I cried my eyelashes off,' she said. 'And what I saw with Barack Obama was something that was . transcendent and I felt transformational for me as a human being and . for this country. 'I often wondered what it would be like to sit and . listen to Lincoln speak or Roosevelt speak or what it would have been . like to have been old enough to understand what Martin Luther King was . saying 45 years ago today,' Oprah said. 'And what he did brought that home in a way . that I could never have imagined,' she added. 'I didn’t not endorse him.' Scroll down for video . Oprah didn't just endorse Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election, she barnstormed the country campaigning with him . Oprah is pictured here with then-candidate Barack Obama and his wife Michelle on the campaign trail in Iowa in December 2007 . In January of 2009, Oprah flew to Washington to celebrate with her friends Barack and Michelle. She taped her show in D.C., shared a private dinner with the newly minted first couple, attended several inauguration balls and partied at the White House. That was the first and last time the Obamas laid out the red carpet for Winfrey after they moved into the White House, Blood Feud suggests. Klein writes that 'Oprah had been promised unique access to the White House by Obama if he won. 'She would get regular briefings on administration initiatives and advance notice on programs, which would give her invaluable material for her fledgling cable venture, OWN, the Oprah Winfrey Network,' he said. ' ""There were big plans,"" ' Oprah's confidant told Klein. Instead, the Obama's snubbed Winfrey after Barack settled into his new role as the leader of the free world. ' "" It slowly dawned on Oprah that the Obamas had absolutely no intention of keeping their word and bringing her into their confidence,"" ' the source said. Winfrey retaliated by prohibiting stories about the Obama's from appearing in her magazine, O, and vowed not to campaign for Barack in 2012. ' ""Oprah was hurt and angry and will never make up with the . Obamas,"" ' Winfrey's friend told Klein. ' ""She knows how to hold a grudge."" ' Oprah blamed Michelle and the president's senior adviser, Valerie Jarrett, directly for double-crossing her. Jarrett, who's described in the book as Michelle's closest friend, blew off Oprah's many requests to chat about how the White House planned to work with OWN. ' "" And just as obviously, President Obama didn't interfere on Oprah's behalf, "" ' Klein's source said. Best of friends: Oprah . taped her show in Washington, D.C. during Barack Obama's 2009 . inauguration and barely left the first couple's side throughout the . festivities . Given the way she was treated after the 2008 election, it should have come as no surprise to the White House that Winfrey was unavailable to campaign for Barack in 2012. ' ""Oprah has turned our back on us,"" ' former White House Senior Adviser David Plouffe allegedly told Obama during a discussion about the president's re-election campaign. Jarrett reportedly rebuffed Plouffe and told Obama that Oprah would end up getting on board. Klein says Jarrett turned out to be wrong, and Oprah 'refused to help.' ' ""Oprah isn't going to do sh*t for us in 2012,"" 'Jarrett was later forced to admit to the president. ' ""She refuses to lift a hand. She's going to announce publicly that she isn't going to campaign for us this time around."" ' In January 2012 Oprah told CNN she was a '100 percent supporter' of Obama but wouldn't verbally endorse the president. Four months later Winfrey told CBS' Charlie Rose in an interview that she was 'not going to be out there' campaigning for Obama throughout the summer and fall. 'I’m 100 percent behind our president. I actually love our president, and have the utmost respect for him and that office and what it takes to be there,' Winfrey said. 'I will not be out there because I’m trying to fix a network.' At the time of Winfrey's announcement, OWN had just laid off 30 employees. Oprah and Michelle attend Time's 100 Most Influential People in the World Gala at Rose Hall - Jazz at Lincoln Center on May 5, 2009 in New York City . Oprah and the Obamas appeared to be on good terms earlier this year. Winfrey hosted Michelle's 50th birthday party at her Maui, Hawaii, home in January . While Oprah's decision keep her head down during the election is supported by her own statements, claims that her decision was rooted in anger at the Obamas doesn't jive with previous or subsequent events. In August 2010, more than a year and a half after Barack took office, Winfrey attended the president's 49th birthday party in Chicago. At a Kennedy Center Honors reception at the White House that December, President Obama had nothing but nice things to say about the billionaire businesswoman. 'Michelle . and I love Oprah Winfrey - personally love this woman,' he said. 'And the more you know Oprah, the more spectacular you . realize her character and her soul are and the more you appreciate what a . wonderful, gifted person she is.' The month before Winfrey announced she wouldn't campaign for Obama again, she attended a $35,800 a plate fundraiser for the president a at Tyler Perry's home in Atlanta, Georgia. There, Obama told party guests: 'When Oprah decides she likes you, then other people like you, too. 'She continues to be not just a friend but somebody Michelle and I seek out in thinking about not just the day to day issues … but  in trying to keep our focus on the big picture. 'And what she’s done for so many people not just in America but around the world is extraordinary,' he said. Barack the backstabber?: A friend of Oprah's told Klein Obama cast Oprah aside soon after he took office . President Barack Obama shakes hands with supporters after speaking at his town hall meeting today at Minnehaha Park, in Minneapolis . Just this past January Winfrey hosted Michelle's 50th birthday party at her home in Maui, Hawaii.

"NBC would have offered The Daily Show's Jon Stewart 'virtually anything' to step into the role of Meet the Press host, believing that he could liven up the Sunday morning political format. Just one month after Chuck Todd took the anchor chair for the weekly news program, reports have surfaced that the network had in fact been desperate for Stewart to front the show. But whatever money or deal was put on the table, comedian and media critic Stewart has resisted NBC's advances and remains at his post on Comedy Central. Just one month after Chuck Todd (right) took the anchor chair for Meet the Press, reports have surfaced that the network had in fact been desperate for Jon Stewart (left) to front the show . New York magazine claimed that before choosing Todd, NBC News president Deborah Turness held negotiations with Stewart. The magazine said this information was according to three senior television sources with knowledge of the talks. One source explained that NBC was prepared to offer Stewart virtually 'anything' to bring him over. 'They were ready to back the Brink's truck up,' the source said. A spokesperson for NBC declined New York magazine's request for comment. James Dixon, Stewart's agent, did not respond to multiple requests for comment. But while Stewart has remained silent on the matter, Todd responded on social media with a tweet referencing the drama. 'If it's Sunday, it's your moment of zen', he wrote. This is not the first time NBC have tried to recruit Jon Stewart.

"A Northern California couple out walking their dog in February 2013 on their Gold Country property stumbled across a modern-day bonanza: $10million in rare, mint-condition gold coins buried in the shadow of an old tree. Nearly all of the 1,427 coins, dating from 1847 to 1894, are in uncirculated, mint condition, said David Hall, co-founder of Professional Coin Grading Service of Santa Ana, which recently authenticated them. Although the face value of the gold pieces only adds up to about $27,000, some of them are so rare that coin experts say they could fetch nearly $1million apiece. Experts say it's likely whoever owned the property 150 years ago buried the coins as a kind of California gold rush-era bank - to save as an investment and for a rainy day. The coins were then forgotten for over a century. Scroll down for video . Booty: A trove of rare Gold Rush-era coins unearthed in California last year by a couple as they walked their dog may be the greatest buried treasure ever found in the United States, worth more than $10million . One of the 1800s-era U.S. gold coins unearthed in California by two people who want to remain anonymous. The value of the ""Saddle Ridge Hoard"" treasure trove is estimated at $10 million or more . Show and tell: David Hall (left), co-founder of Professional Coin Grading Service, poses with some of 1,427 Gold-Rush era U.S. gold coins, at his office in Santa Ana . 'I don't like to say once-in-a-lifetime . for anything, but you don't get an opportunity to handle this kind of . material, a treasure like this, ever,' said veteran numismatist Don . Kagin, who is representing the finders. 'It's like they found the pot of . gold at the end of the rainbow.' Kagin, whose family has been in the rare-coin business for 81 years, would say little about the couple other than that they are husband and wife, are middle-aged and have lived for several years on the rural property where the coins were found. He first met the couple last April. They have no idea who put the the coins there, he said. The pair are choosing to remain . anonymous, Kagin said, in part to avoid a renewed gold rush to their . property by modern-day prospectors armed with metal detectors. However, Kagin's company posted a brief question and answer interview with the couple - identified only as John and Mary - on a website set up to market the coins. Mary revealed that the discovery of the coins was foretold by her astrological chart - through she didn't realize it at the time. 'I did look back at it. It’s very funny, my chart did talk about treasure, but it was more about the treasure of spirit….' she said. She added: 'I never would have thought we would have found something like this; however, in a weird way I feel like I have been preparing my whole life for it. Precious exhibits: Some of 1,427 Gold-Rush era U.S. gold coins are displayed at Professional Coin Grading Service in Santa Ana, Calif. Most of the coins were minted in San Francisco, but one $5 gold piece came from as far away as Georgia . California Gold Country: Near the center of the map is Sutter's Mill, the site of the 1848 find that started the Gold Rush. Hopeful prospectors flocked to the area east of Sacramento to the Nevada line and down through much of the Sierra Nevada range . 'John just knew what to do - it was a little bit karmic… Perhaps in some way we were the ones that could honor the coins.' John and Mary are a self-employed couple in their 40s. 'The family and the attorneys researched who might have put them there, and they came up with nothing,' Kagin said. 'The nearest we can guess is that whoever left the coins might have been involved in the mining industry.' They also don't want to be treated any differently, said David McCarthy, chief numismatist for Kagin Inc. of Tiburon. 'Their concern was this would change the way everyone else would look at them, and they're pretty happy with the lifestyle they have today,' he said. They plan to put most of the coins up for sale through Amazon while holding onto a few keepsakes. They'll use the money to pay off bills and quietly donate to local charities, Kagin said. Before they sell them, they are loaning some to the American Numismatic Association for its National Money Show, which opens Thursday in Atlanta.

Lucky find: A can containing 19th century gold coins is shown in the ground . CALIFORNIA GOLD RUSH 1848 - 1864 . Sutter's Mill in Coloma, California - Site of the find that started the California Gold Rush . While the lucky California couple who discovered the $10million in gold coins won't reveal themselves, the shocking find illustrates the vivid, gold-lined history of the region. The region where the ranch is located is known as California Gold Country. It was in the region in 1848 that the California gold rush began when the precious metal was discovered at Sutter's Mill in Coloma near Sacramento. Though it was just a few tiny nuggets, the find kicked off one of human history's largest migrations as gold hungry prospectors descended on the area from around the world. Fast forward to today and the region's once booming population has shrunk considerably along with the ebb of the Gold Rush. THE SADDLE RIDGE HOARD . Thought the Gold Rush ended some 150 years ago, the California couple stumbled upon a rich hoard. The coins date from 1847 to 1894. Those dates are one of the things that makes the coins so rare. Because paper money was illegal in California until the 1870s, most coins minted before then are extremely worn. However, coins in the Saddle Ridge Hoard--so named because that's what the couple named the area of their ranch where the treasure was found--are mostly in uncirculated mint condition. What makes their find particularly . valuable, McCarthy said, is that almost all of the coins are in . near-perfect condition. That means that whoever put them into the ground . likely socked them away as soon as they were put into circulation. Because . paper money was illegal in California until the 1870s, he added, it's . extremely rare to find any coins from before that of such high quality. 'It wasn't really until the 1880s that you start seeing coins struck in California that were kept in real high grades of preservation,' he said. The coins, in $5, $10 and $20 denominations, were stored more or less in chronological order, McCarthy said, with the 1840s and 1850s pieces going into one canister until it was filed, then new coins going into the next one and the next one after that. The dates and the method indicated that whoever put them there was using the ground as their personal bank and that they weren't swooped up all at once in a robbery. Although most of the coins were minted in San Francisco, one $5 gold piece came from as far away as Georgia. The coins were store chronologically, with the 1840s and 1850s pieces going into one canister until it was filed, then new coins going into the next one and the next one after that. The dates and the method indicated that whoever put them there was using the ground as their personal bank . Experts are lauding the Gold Country find as one of the most spectacular ever found in America and put its value at $10million or more. Some of the rarer coins could fetch $1million a piece. Here are some of the other frontrunners for greatest American treasures: . Tennessee construction workers unearthed $1million in gold coins in 1985. 400,000 silver coins were found in a dead Reno, Nevada man's home in 1974 and fetched $7.3million. Coins and ingots worth $130million were found in the 1980s in a ship that sunk off North Carolina, but that hefty hoard wasn't truly discovered...historians knew all along it was out there . Kagin and McCarthy would say little about the couple's property or its ownership history, other than it's in a sprawling hilly area of Gold Country and the coins were found along a path the couple had walked for years. On the day they found them last spring, the woman had bent over to examine an old rusty can that erosion had caused to pop slightly out of the ground. They found eight cans in total. 'Don't be above bending over to check on a rusty can,' he said she told him. They are located on a section of the property the couple nicknamed Saddle Ridge, and Kagin is calling the find the Saddle Ridge Hoard. He believes it could be the largest such discovery in U.S. history. One of the largest previous finds of gold coins was $1million worth uncovered by construction workers in Jackson, Tennessee, in 1985. More than 400,000 silver dollars were found in the home of a Reno, Nevada, man who died in 1974 and were later sold intact for $7.3million. Gold coins and ingots said to be worth as much as $130million were recovered in the 1980s from the wreck of the SS Central America. But historians knew roughly where that gold was because the ship went down off the coast of North Carolina during a hurricane in 1857.","The lucky unnamed couple in their 40s stumbled on the historic find on their property last spring .

"Man who sent his teenage nephew into a busy intersection with a fake grenade launcher and dressed in Arab mimicking garb was convicted of endangering the boy’s life and carrying out a terrorism hoax and could face five or more years in prison. Filmmaker Michael David Turley of Phoenix, Arizona was tried in Maricopa County Superior Court and jurors deliberated for two hours Monday before convicting the 40-year-old after prosecutors argued Turley could have gotten the boy killed because some witnesses said they even considered running him over in their vehicles. At the time of the July stunt, Turley videotaped his nephew, whose head and body were wrapped in cloth, while he carried a fake rocket launcher as the boy pretended to be a terrorist. Scary? Michael David Turley sent his teenaged nephew into a Phoenix intersection dressed in mock terrorist garb and carrying a fake grenade launcher in July and says it was to test the local authorities' response time . Crusader? Michael David Turley could face five years or more in jail for the stunt, but his attorney is pushing for a probation sentence . Turley told an officer who arrived at the scene that he and his 16-year-old nephew, who was wrapped in a baby blue sheet, were filming a movie. They were not arrested at that point. Turley's video commentary makes a point of this, suggesting the officer, who told Turley to put the camera down, wasn't concerned enough about the possibility it was an actual terrorist attack. However, after the YouTube video he posted of the stunt made the rounds online, Turley was arrested and charged with giving a false impression of a terrorist act, according to abc15.com. In the YouTube video, Turley said he wanted to see how long it would take authorities to respond to a terrorist situation and mentioned a movie theater shooting two weeks earlier that killed 12 people in Aurora, Colo. He was also charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor and ‘misconduct of simulated explosive devices.’ Sentencing is set for Aug. 8. Prosecutors said Turley faces penalties ranging from probation to more than five years in prison. Turley's attorney, Brad Rideout, said he planned to 'argue for probation' for his client unless he wants to appeal the verdict. 'We haven't discussed that with him yet,' Rideout said. 'My client is in shock.' Slow response: Turley and his nephew walked around a Phoenix, Arizona neighborhood hoping to attract the attention of police but were disappointed no one seemed afraid . In a YouTube video that Turley made of the hoax, his young relative was dressed in a sheet, had a scarf wrapped around his head, made erratic movements while in a crosswalk and pointed the fake weapon at vehicles, prompting motorists to call 911. Prosecutor Michael Anderson told jurors in closing arguments Monday that Turley, who was responsible for his nephew's safety that day, could have gotten his young relative killed in the hoax. Anderson said some motorists who saw the teen with the realistic-looking fake launcher had discussions about whether they should run him over. Still, some recordings of 911 calls also showed that some witnesses assumed the weapon was a fake. Police response: Police initially questioned Turley and his nephew but didn't seem concerned and didn't pursue it . Rideout said callers weren't terrified and instead figured they were witnessing a joke, pointing out that they could see his client filming the hoax and that his nephew did a brief dance while on the street corner. Earlier in the trial that began June 11, Rideout told jurors that it was foolish for Turley to get his nephew involved but noted that no one was injured and no vehicles wrecked as a result of the hoax. In testimony last week, Turley said his video of the hoax was meant to be satirical and that most passing motorists laughed at them. He told jurors he didn't think his actions endangered his nephew's life. Suburban commando: Though police didn't pursue the issue at first, once the YouTube footage came out, they pressed charges. Turley has now been convicted of endangering his nephew and carrying out a terrorist hoax .","Turley was also convicted of giving a false impression of a terrorist act .

"What a gamble: Statisticians calculated a system to virtually guarantee a win . A group of science and mathematical experts won almost $8million on a state lottery after discovering a fool-proof way of winning. The group, which included a biomedical researcher and MIT undergraduates who were 'looking for an interesting school project', bought more than $40million of tickets over seven years but won approximately $48million - an $8million profit. Statisticians calculated that, during brief periods when the unclaimed jackpot of the Massachusetts Cash WinFall game total reached $2million, players buying $100,000 worth of tickets would almost certainly win. And their gamble paid off. Using these small windows of opportunity, the group bought as many tickets as they could, using a loophole in which lottery officials failed to limit the amount that could be sold in one day. During these high payout intervals, the gambling syndicates won most of the lottery's prizes. Officials at the Massachusetts state . lottery knew one of their games had essentially been taken over by the . group of highly-intelligent gamblers but did nothing because their . syndicate generated $16million. The gambling group included graduates from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (pictured) who were looking for an interesting school project . The MIT researchers capitalised on the way the Cash WinFall game worked. Unlike most lotteries, the jackpot was limited to $2m, and once this was surpassed the excess redistributed to smaller prizes – known as a ‘roll-down’ week. The smaller jackpots won by matching five of six numbers became five to ten times bigger on roll-down weeks – with the typical $4,000 win becoming up to $40,000. The group calculated if they bought $600,000 of tickets on rollover weeks, they would most likely make a 10-15 per cent profit. As the success of the scheme became clear they began buying enough tickets to force a roll-down week themselves. Their system became an almost . full-time business as the sophisticated gamblers snapped up hundreds of . thousands of lottery tickets at $2 each. By 2005 they had essentially . monopolised  the game. The group's scheme came to light in a recently-published report by the state's inspector general, the Boston Globe reports. It is thought lottery officials found out about the loophole in 2010 - or maybe earlier - but did not act because it was bringing in so much money, the report added. However, when journalists began looking . into the loophole last summer, lottery chiefs introduced a $5,000 limit . on the number of tickets retailers were allowed to sell every day. The Cash WinFall game was finally halted by Massachusetts state treasurer Steven Grossman earlier this year. Grossman told the Boston Globe: . 'I feel it is important to essentially apologise to the public because a . game was created that allowed syndicates to gain special opportunities . that others did not have - using machines themselves, partnership with . lottery agents, using them after hours. We’re sorry some gained unfair . advantage. 'Revenues were tremendous and the . lottery benefited, but there were practices that were not appropriate . and things done that were not right.' The report into the Massachusetts syndicate concluded that, while it had been a financial success for the lottery, no officials personally benefited financially from it. Officials were simply guilty of failing to manage the game and enforcing the rules. Massachusetts is not the only state to be targeted by gambling networks. The same loophole was used and exploited in a similar lottery in Michigan. One group was said to have netted $8million profit before the game was shut down in 2005.","Gamblers virtually took over Massachusetts Cash WinFall lottery, officials admit .

"A pregnant woman was left with these life-changing injuries after a close friend's dog mauled her face until it was 'hanging off'. Laura Holmes, 21, said she feared she and her unborn baby would die when the American Akita dog attacked her as she sat sending a text message. The animal leapt up and tore at her face, ripping chunks of flesh from her mouth and cheeks, leaving her needing 60 stitches. Friends then tried to drag the pet off her and only succeeded when they repeatedly kicked the dangerous dog, which was later destroyed. The dog's owner has become the first in Britain to be prosecuted under tough new laws after failing to control the seven stone Akita. Scroll down for video . Recovery: Laura Holmes has had significant re-constructive surgery but admits she can't look in the mirror - but happily her son Nathanial is happy and healthy despite his early delivery . Before: Miss Holmes, left before the attack, says she is lucky to be alive after the attack while she was pregnant, right . Miss Holmes, from Nottingham, was rushed to Queen's Medical Centre, where surgeons battled to save her face and her baby. Laura had to give birth to baby Nathaniel - now 15 weeks old - by C-section because doctors felt she may not be able to withstand the pain of a natural birth due to her injuries. In a landmark prosecution, the dog's owner, Tracie Taylor, received a 16-week jail sentence suspended for a year and was ordered to pay Laura just £1000 in compensation. Under new laws changed on May 13 - just a day before Laura was left with life-changing injuries - owners can be taken to court if the animal is dangerous and out of control. The dog, Koda, was destroyed shortly after the attack when Taylor, also from Nottingham, surrendered it to police and she has also been banned from owning any animals in the future. 'I thought I was going to die - I was so afraid for my life and my unborn baby's life,' the victim said. 'The doctors told me my injuries were so bad I am lucky to be alive. 'My face was hanging off and I've been left with really awful scarring. I'm too upset to even look in the mirror now. Dangerous:  This is Koda, the American Akita who attacked Laura Holmes. It was destroyed shortly after the attack and it emerged it had already bitten someone else four years earlier . In the dock: In a landmark prosecution, the dog's owner, Tracie Taylor, received a 16-week jail sentence suspended for a year and was ordered to pay Laura, right during her recovery, £1,000 in compensation . Painful: Miss Holmes also has the scars from the attack all over her body, including her arms . 'I've never been so scared. I was sitting in my friend's house sending a text - she'd had the dog for about seven years and I'd never even seen it growl before. Irresponsible dog owners who allow their dog to attack people or assistance dogs will face tougher prison sentences from today. Changes to the Dangerous Dogs Act will also mean dog owners can now face prosecution if their dog attacks a person in their home or on any private property, except if they attack a trespasser. The maximum sentences for allowing a dog to attack someone have also been substantially increased. The maximum prison sentences in England and Wales are now: . Up to 14 years, from two years, for a fatal dog attack. Up to five years, from two years, for injury. Up to three years if an assistance dog is attacked. 'I looked up from my phone and then I saw this dog launching itself at me - and before I knew it I was in the worst pain I'd ever felt in my life. 'My first thought was for my baby - I was terrified the attack would mean I would lose him. I was trying to scream and tear the dog off my face but he wouldn't let go. 'My friends were screaming and trying to grab the dog, but when it let go of my face it grabbed my leg - it was chasing me through the house. 'I would never normally hurt a dog but I had to start booting it to get it off me. 'I ran to the bathroom and stood over the sink. When I looked down I saw my own flesh had fallen into the sink.' The dog had already bitten someone else four years earlier, but due to the law at the time no prosecution had been brought. Laura added: 'This never should have happened to me because it bit someone before but nothing was done about it. he dog chased me through two rooms - it wouldn't stop. 'There was no barking or growling - it just went for my face and that was that. 'My hair was soaked in blood so they cut it all off and I wasn't allowed to wash my face after the first surgery which took six and a half hours.' Laura was operated on at Queens Medical Centre, Nottingham, and is due to have further facial surgery in December and is still struggling to eat and drink after the assault. Nottingham Magistrates Court heard yesterday that it was the second time that the dog had attacked someone. Innocent: Heavily pregnant Laura Holmes was sending a text when Koda suddenly leapt up and tore at her face . David Miles, prosecuting, said: 'Laura went upstairs and saw the dog looking out of the window. 'She sat on the bed and looked at her phone and with no warning the dog bit her face. 'She tried to get off the bed and the dog then bit her on the right arm and as she turned away from the animal it bit her on the left leg. 'Laura ran from the room to the bathroom but the dog managed to get hold of her left arm this time and started to pull. 'She managed to get in the bathroom and when she looked down she saw her own flesh in the sink. 'The defendant's daughter took down the mirror so she could not look at what had happened.' Taylor represented herself in court and said: 'I can't sleep at night and have considered ending it all. 'I am leaving Nottingham because it is not fair that the family have to see me all the time after what happened.' Magistrate Geoff Jordan said: 'We accept no amount of money could compensate the victim. 'It is not the court's view that this is how much the injury is worth and if we could award more we would.' Dogs' legislation officer PC Steve Feary said: 'I believe this is the first conviction of its kind for Nottinghamshire and one of the first for the country. 'But no one wins here. Laura was badly injured that evening and she will carry the physical scars with her for the rest of her life, not to mention the psychological effects she continues to battle - and all this while trying to raise a new baby. 'I hope this serves as reminder that being a pet owner, and particularly a dog owner, brings with it accountability. 'If someone dies as a result of your dog attacking them you could face up to 14 years' imprisonment. If they are injured it's up to five years.'","Laura Holmes, 21,  feared she and her unborn baby would die in May attack .

"The Government tonight lost another vote in the House of Lords over its plans to shake-up the welfare system. Peers rejected plans for a 'bedroom tax' on under-occupied council houses by a majority of 10. The amended Bill will now have to be sent back to the House of Commons However, the Government are likely to stand-firm and overturn the changes. Defeat: Peers tonight voted through an amendment to the Government's Welfare Reform Bill and it will have to be sent back to the House of Commons (file photo) It is the latest House of Lords defeat in the battle between the two houses over plans to cap benefits at £26,000 per year. The plans will save the taxpayer £290million in 2013-14 and are designed to encourage benefit claimants to get back to work. Under the draft legislation, people in council properties will lose £14 per week in state handouts for every spare room they have from next April. Peers voted by 236 votes to 226 to exempt the disabled, war widows and foster carers from the proposed £14 cut. Six Liberal Democrat rebels voted in favour of the amendment - in defiance of Government policy. The exemptions - proposed by crossbench peer Lord Best - will cost around £100million. Lord Best insisted his amendment . would not remove the pressure on 'scroungers' who were able to work and . was targeted at those who needed help. He said: 'These are households for . whom pressures to take a job, a key policy driver for the Government ... are not relevant. For these people the penalty simply represents a . substantial loss of income with no escape.' Reforms: Iain Duncan Smith, the Work and Pensions Secretary, wants to cut state handouts to £26,000-per-year . He added that it was unfair that people would face the benefits cut automatically from next April if no new properties are available - even if they are prepared to move. He told the House of Lords: 'To suddenly impose the under occupation penalty on all these households before they have any chance to move elsewhere seems most unjust.' He added: 'The new amendment confines the postponement of the imposition of the bedroom tax to certain categories only rather than to all tenants. 'I deeply regret abandoning hundreds of thousands of households, who even if this amendment is approved, will still be caught by the penalty charge on April 1 next year, even if they are willing to move, but are trapped where they are because there are no smaller flats available. 'However, needs must and the new amendment reduces the cost in the early years, from perhaps a maximum of £300million by around half, a far cry from the billions referred to in earlier debate.' Labour's Baroness Hollis of Heigham backed Lord Best and said the Government's cuts were hitting the most vulnerable. She told peers: 'Families with a . disabled child can lose £14 a week while most of us enjoy a tax-free . winter fuel allowance, or find for the second year running that our . council tax has been frozen. 'Not a penny of these cuts are . falling on me, and I suspect on very few of you, and yet we are asking . disabled families and families with disabled children to carry those . cuts for us.' Shadow work and pensions secretary . Liam Byrne said: 'The Lords voted today to protect war widows, carers . and disabled people from having instant rent cuts and potentially . becoming homeless. 'To propose the idea shows just how . far this Government has now left basic decency behind. The Government . attempted this desperate cut because they've let the unemployment bill . spiral out of control. 'What they should focus on now is boosting the number of taxpayers by getting more people back into jobs.' The Welfare Reform Bill has already endured a . difficult time in the House of Lords, where peers have inflicted a series of . defeats on ministers. Earlier this month MPs threw out a series of changes made by peers. The decision tonight to back Lord Best's amendment means the Welfare Reform Bill will now have to go back to the Commons again. The latest round in the welfare reform battle protracted session of parliamentary 'ping . pong' with the legislation being sent between the two chambers until . agreement can be reached.","Welfare Reform Bill which will cap handouts at £26k will now be sent back to the House of Commons .

"ISIS jihadis have threatened to forcibly marry any female fighters they manage to capture in a message delivered to the Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga. Speaking exclusively to MailOnline, Colonel Nahida Ahmad Rashid, commanding officer of the 2nd Battalion Peshmerga Female, said that the jihadis even plan to wed women they are 'disgusted' by. 'The message said that whenever they catch any Peshmerga woman, they will marry them,' she explains. No surrender: Col. Rashid, holding a picture of a dead fighter, says she is unfazed by ISIS' marriage threat . Fighting on: Col. Rashid and her troops have instead vowed to kill as many ISIS jihadis as possible . 'Even if they are disgusted by her, they will marry her. Even if they don't want to use them. Still, marriage.' But Colonel Rashid says she and her troops have other ideas and revealed that she has asked fighters to keep a spare bullet to hand in case of capture. 'I have told all my frontline soldiers to keep one bullet in their pocket in case they are captured,' she reveals. 'I never want any of them to be captured by ISIS.' So far, Colonel Rashid and her fighters have not needed to use their spare bullets, although she says that other PKK [Kurdistan Worker's Party] soldiers fighting in the Syrian town of Kobane have been forced to do so. 'Last week, one of the PKK fighters found herself alone and surrounded by ISIS after all her friends had been killed.  She shot herself rather than let them take her.' On the frontline: Col. Rashid greets one of her captains during a visit to the frontline in Iraq . No messing: Peshmerga fighters such as this lady say they will fight ISIS to their very last drop of blood . Orders: Fighters have been told to keep a spare bullet to use on themselves in case of capture by ISIS . Unstoppable: Col. Rashid says her troops are better than those deployed by ISIS but their weapons are worse . The Kurdish Peshmerga is famous for its use of female soldiers, all of whom battle alongside their male counterparts on the frontline. As a result, they are on the sharp end of the fight against ISIS who, according to Colonel Rashid, are particularly terrified of women fighters because they believe that men dispatched by women won't go to Paradise. 'ISIS are real hypocrites,' she sniffs, disdainfully. 'They think if they are killed by women Peshmergas, they aren't going to go to heaven. ' 'They want to make us submissive but they are afraid of us so they are real hypocrites.' But if ISIS hope that their threats of forced marriage will make Colonel Rashid and her fighters rethink their participation in battle, she has a stern message for them - we will find you and when we do, we will kill you. 'It is a huge tragedy for me to see humans, in the 21st Century, torturing and beheading people like ISIS do,' she adds. 'Until the day I die, until the last drop of my blood, I will fight ISIS. Training: Female Peshmerga fighters go through exactly the same training as their male counterparts . Equal: Col. Rashid says the only difference is that women don't use the very heaviest machine guns . Visit: Over the crest of the hill, hidden by blue tarpaulin, lurk a group of ISIS jihadis . Ready to fight: According to Col. Rashid, Peshmerga women never run away or refuse to fight . 'I find them indescribably disgusting. How would you feel if it was women living near you who were being married off by force by ISIS? How would you feel? They are doing the most disgusting things I have ever seen in my life.' She also hit out at men who think women make less impressive fighters. 'On the frontline, the only difference between a male peshmerga and us is in the machine guns we use. 'The heaviest weapon we use is the 14.7mm. The men use heavier guns. Other than that, there are no differences between us. 'When the enemy comes, you have a gun in your hand and you have to fight. If you run back, they will kill you. If you don't fight, they will kill you. You have to fight to survive.' Dangerous: The Peshmerga have suffered relatively light casualties in Iraq so far . Plans: Sevres, a 22-year-old Peshmerga fighter, says she is happy that she's being deployed to the frontline . Clean up operation: Sevres says she and her friends will 'clean Iraq of dirty ISIS' jihadis . What's more, she says, she has no shortage of volunteers willing to join her force - including her own 10-year-old daughter. 'She is just 10 but she wants to become a Peshmerga,' she chuckles. 'She says she wants to take revenge on ISIS for all the things they have done to children.' One who feels the same is a 22-year-old fighter named Sevres. A newcomer to frontline life, she says she is hugely proud of her country and will fight to defend it whatever the cost. She too has little time for ISIS and describes their thoughts on female fighters as 'freakish', saying that along with her husband, she plans to kick them out of Iraq. 'I feel very sad about the things they [ISIS] do and the threats they have made against us women if they capture or kidnap us. But my priority now is to defend my country, not listen to what they say.' Ominously, she adds: 'I am so happy that I am going to defend my country. I am going to clean the place of dirty ISIS.'

"A high school valedictorian denied her diploma after delivering a speech deemed too racy by her principal says she will not apologize for her choice of words. Appearing on NBC's Today show, recent graduate Kaitlin Nootbaar from Oklahoma's Prague High School said she doesn't need her diploma nor does her school need her apology after using the word 'Hell' in her class speech. 'I know what I've achieved and the fact that I don't want to give an apology, maybe I'll never get my diploma and that's fine,' the 18-year-old told NBC's Matt Laurer on Wednesday. Scroll down for video . Won't back down: High school valedictorian Kaitlin Nootbaar has refused to apologize after delivering a speech at her high school graduation that included the word 'Hell' in it . Upset: Because of her refusal to apologize, her former high school has refused to give her her diploma which has upset both her and her father, left . Appearing by her father's side, David Nootbaar, a military veteran, expressed his pride in his daughter for not backing down and practicing her first amendment in her speech that drew laughter and applause by her fellow students. 'Why should she bow down to this man and give those rights away when so many young men are laying their lives on the line to protect those rights?' Mr Nootbaar said. Moving on without her diploma, Miss Nootbaar is preparing to start her freshmen year at Southwestern Oklahoma State University on a full scholarship this fall after receiving straight A's throughout her four years in high school. When she went to collect her certificate from the school's administration office last week she was told she wouldn't be getting it until she wrote a formal letter apologising for using the unacceptable word. Not needed: Despite denied her diploma, the straight-A student says she doesn't need it as she embarks on her freshmen year of college on full scholarship . Apology: The 18-year-old issued an apology to her school and teachers on Wednesday, however, after hearing of numerous calls of harassment over the issue . 'We went to the office and asked for the diploma and the principal said ""Your diploma is right here but you’re not getting it. Close the door we have a problem"",' Mr Nootbaar told kfor.com. The script for the teenager's speech - inspired by the film Eclipse: The Twilight Saga - . had been given to the school in advance of the ceremony. It included the . word 'heck' but in the moments leading up to the ceremony she said she decided to change it to 'hell' instead. 'Right before I got on stage is when I talked it over with my classmates and the ones I had talked to were like no go ahead and say it!' she told NBC. As her father explained: 'Her quote was, when she first started school she wanted to be a nurse, then a veterinarian. Parody: The valedictorian, pictured, said that her speech was a parody of one given in the Twilight movie Eclipse . 'And now that she was getting closer . to graduation people would ask her what do you want to do and she said . ""How the hell do I know? I’ve changed my mind so many times.""' Furious, Miss Nootbaar said she won't be saying sorry because she doesn't think she did anything wrong. 'She earned that diploma she completed all the state curriculum,' said Mr Nootbaar. 'In four years she has never made a B. She got straight A’s and had a 4.0 the whole way through. 'She has worked so hard to stay at the top of her class and this is not right.' Despite her upset, Miss Nootbaar did offer one apology to her teachers, however. 'I'm sorry about the problems that this has caused the school especially the teachers. I've heard that they've been getting calls from numerous people and that would be nice if that would stop,' she said. Watch the video here: .

"Children should do Sudoku and crosswords in school to boost their brain power, experts say. Doing Sudoku puzzles improves memory and doing crosswords improves verbal fluency and word games are great for learning vocabulary, University of Cambridge researchers have found. Their report, Puzzles in Education, presents the results of an extensive review into the use of puzzles in schools. Children should do Sudoku and crosswords in school to boost their brain power, experts say . Although 75 per cent of teachers use puzzles in some form in their lessons, they are often seen as ways to engage children rather than improve learning. But the research suggests that puzzles have far wider psychological and cognitive benefits for pupils including those at the Key Stage Two level, aged seven to 11 years old. The games were found to be most useful in learning terminology and vocabulary, abstract reasoning and memorising data. Sudoku, the popular Japanese logic-based puzzle, is especially useful in teaching maths and science, if it is adapted. For instance, using chemical symbols instead of numbers. Internet safety: More children are using tablets . Nursery school age children are being taught internet safety because of the soaring use of iPads and tablets. About 28 per cent of three-and four-year-olds use a tablet computer at home, according to Ofcom, and many nurseries have iPads for children. The charity ChildNet, which helps schools hold classes on the web, said it is increasingly being invited in to pre-school establishments to hold online safety lessons. The toddlers are given simple messages not taught about specific dangers, such as online bullying or the risks of being groomed. ‘This is the age where children are starting to interact with technology,’ said chief executive Will Gardner. ‘The message is: If something goes wrong, tell someone. ‘Touch screens have enabled access to technology to go right down the age range.’ Word searches are recommended for learning about specific topics, particularly where a knowledge of terminology or vocabulary is needed. And crosswords help verbal fluency, improve memory and general problem-solving skills. Generally, all puzzles were found to support the National Curriculum. The study, compiled by the university’s Faculty of Education, was commissioned by Puzzler Media. ‘This research reveals the clear value of puzzles within educational practice,’ said Kath Donovan, director of primary at the learning company Pearson. ‘They can be engaging... but they are not used enough.’","Sudoku puzzles can improve your child's memory, experts have claimed .

"These are the incredible before-and-after pictures of 37-year-old Richard Lee Norris who was given the most extensive face transplant ever performed. Mr Norris, who was injured in a 1997 gun accident, was pictured seven months after being given a new face, teeth, tongue and jaw in a  36-hour surgery at the University of Maryland Medical Center. For 15 years, Mr Norris . lived as a recluse in Hillsville, Virginia, hiding behind a mask and only coming out at night time. He can now feel his face and is able to brush his teeth and shave. He's also regained his sense of smell, which he had lost after the accident. Scroll down to see the transplant taking place . Incredible: Richard Lee Norris, 37, who had the most extensive face transplant to date, is seen before and in a photo made 114 days after the transplant was performed in March . When he shot himself in the face in . 1997, Mr Norris lost his nose, lips and most movement in his mouth. He has had . multiple life-saving, reconstructive surgeries which also replaced underlying nerve and muscle tissue from scalp to neck. Motor function is now 80 per cent on the right side of the face and 40 per cent on the left. 'I am now able to walk past people and . no one even gives me a second look. My friends have moved on with their . lives, starting families and careers. I can now start working on the new . life given back to me,' he said in a release to NBC. He received the new face from an anonymous donor in March whose organs saved five other patients' lives on the same day. The transplant was led by Dr Eduardo D. Rodriguez, professor of surgery at the University . of Maryland School of Medicine and chief of plastic, reconstructive and . maxillofacial surgery at Shock Trauma. Dramatic: Mr Norris suffered gun injuries in 1997 and has underwent years of surgeries before his final life-changing face transplant in March (right) 'Before, people used to stare at . Richard because he wore a mask and they wanted to see the deformity,' Rodriguez said in March. 'Now, they have another reason to stare at him, . and it's really amazing.' Mr Norris opened his eyes on the third day after the surgery with his family around him. 'He put the mirror down and thanked me and hugged me,' said Dr Rodriguez.  'We concealed all the lines so it would give him the most immediate best appearance with minimal touch-ups down the road.' To ensure Mr Norris would retain . maximum function of his facial expressions and movements, doctors gave . him a new tongue for proper speech, eating, and chewing, normally . aligned teeth, and connected his nerves to allow for smiling. Norris's transplant comes on the . heels of successful face transplants in Forth Worth, Texas, and Boston, . Massachusetts, last year. He is the first full face transplant recipient . in the United States to retain his eyesight. A virtual army of 100 doctors, . scientists and other university medical staff ranging from plastic . surgeons to craniofacial specialists teamed up for the operation. The surgery involved ten years of . research funded by the Department of Defense's Office of Naval Research, . and will serve as a model for helping war veterans injured by . improvised explosive devices in Afghanistan, the university said. Transformation : Scans show the original injuries to Norris's face (left), with the damaged areas removed and after the transplant (right) 'Surreal experience': Lead surgeon Eduardo Rodriguez explains how the procedure successfully replaced the 37-year-old's face, teeth, tongue and jaw . 'Amazing': The operation by Dr Rodriguez and his team took 36 hours and is believed to be the most extensive procedure of its kind ever performed . Rodriguez saluted the work of the . teams around the world that had conducted the 22 face transplants to . date, without which, he said, this operation would not have been . possible. The first full face transplant was . performed in France in 2005 on a woman who was mauled by her dog. The . Cleveland Clinic performed the first face transplant in the U.S. in . 2008. The Department of Defense has been funding some face and hand surgeries with the goal of helping wounded soldiers. More . than 1,000 troops have lost an arm or leg in Afghanistan or Iraq, and . the government estimates that 200 troops might be eligible for face . transplants. The University . of Maryland's research on transplants was funded by a grant from the . Office of Naval Research, and doctors said they hope to begin operating . soon on military patients. Officials provided little detail on Norris or the circumstances of the accident. 'This . accidental injury just destroyed everything. The rest of his friends . and colleagues went on to start getting married, having children, owning . homes,' Dr Rodriguez said. 'He wants to make up for all of that.' 2005: The first ever face transplant was performed in 2005 on a 38-year-old French patient, Isabelle Dinoire, who had to have the surgery after a large part of her face was ripped off in a horrific dog attack. She was unable to speak or eat properly because of her injuries. Her new face was transplanted from a woman of 46 who died from a severe loss of blood to the brain. 2008: The first person to receive a face transplant in the U.S. was Connie Culp, from Ohio. The now 48-year-old was operated on in 2008 after her top lip, nose, roof of her mouth, one eye and both cheeks were destroyed by then husband Tom, who brutally shot her in the face after flying into a rage. Surgeons spent months trying to fix the damage by trying numerous plastic surgery procedures but it took a donor's face mixed with part of her own for it to work. 2010: A Spanish farmer, known only as Oscar, was horribly injured in 2005 a shooting accident, which prevented him from breathing normally and made it difficult to swallow or speak. After two years of planning, a team of 30 doctors started work on him in March 2010, in an operation which was to last 24 hours. The transplant included complete facial skin and muscles, eyelids, nose, lips, upper jaw, all his teeth, the palate, cheekbones and lower jaw. 2010: Charla Nash, from Stamford, Connecticut, was so severely mauled by a 200-pound chimpanzee called Travis that belonged to her friend, that she lost her eyesight, hands and face. Nash received a face and hand transplant in 2010 over 72 hours of operations in total. Her hands later had to be removed after infection set in. She is now suing the state of Connecticut. 2011: Dallas Wiens became the first man in the U.S. to receive a face transplant after suffering life-threatening burns when he fell off a lift platform and slammed into a live power cable that seared off his face. A team of 30 doctors, nurses, anaesthesiologists and residents performed the transplant at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, replacing Wiens' nose, lips, facial skin, muscles of facial animation and nerves. 2012: Ugur Acar, 19, from Turkey, suffered serious burns to his face during a house fire when he was just 40 days old. He underwent several procedures through his life until he received the cosmetic procedure to repair his face in January at Akdeniz University's School of Medicine in the country.

The other San Jose, set in California's Silicon Valley, is the third largest city in the state. It was founded in 1777, as El Pueblo de San José de Guadalupe, the first civilian town in the Spanish colony of Nueva California.

"British cleaners and Portuguese manual workers are among new suspects in the Madeleine McCann investigation, The Mail on Sunday has learned. Scotland Yard identified what they describe as ‘people of interest’ during a review of the Portuguese inquiry into the three-year-old’s disappearance in May, 2007. The suspects are thought to number 12 – not 20 as has been reported – and include a number of British cleaners who were working near the apartment complex where Madeleine, twin siblings Sean and Amelie and parents Gerry and Kate were staying. Detectives are believed to be investigating whether a couple comforted a crying Madeleine McCann . Sources said ‘low-level’ workers – handymen, cleaners and gardeners – have become the focus of interest. Some are thought to have been employed by the Ocean Club complex on a casual basis and may have already been interviewed. Police are said to be keen to trace six British cleaners who were working in Praia da Luz when Madeleine vanished and who didn’t appear in the Portuguese files. They are said to have used a white van and went from apartment to apartment offering their services, chiefly concentrating on expats. Gerry McCann and Kate McCann hold their twins Sean and Amelie at the Ocean Club Resort in 2007 . The Ocean Club in Praia da Luz where Maddie disappeared. Portuguese police refuse to reopen the case . A source said: ‘There is quite a culture of people drifting from door to door offering services from everything from your garden to your roof or windows.’ As well as the manual workers there are a number of more obvious suspects who already appear in the Portuguese files but who British police feel haven’t been ‘bottomed out’ properly and therefore warrant further investigation. ‘There are a lot of people who could be explored further, if only to be eliminated,’ said Detective Chief Superintendent Hamish Campbell, head of Scotland Yard’s Homicide and Serious Crime Command. However officers face having to break down Portuguese resistance to re-opening the inquiry. Officials in Lisbon say they can reopen the case only if there is new evidence. But it has been claimed that the new leads could, if properly explored, result in new evidence and possibly solve the Madeleine mystery. Madeleine disappeared in 2007 when she was on holiday with her parents and brother and sister in Portugal . Kate and Gerry McCann have never given up hunting for their daughter . Detectives examining the Portuguese files were alarmed that the original inquiry had not traced and interviewed all the staff and holidaymakers who were at the Ocean Club when Madeleine went missing. Last year the Met said that it had identified 195 fresh leads that should have been investigated either by conducting further witness interviews, eliminating suspects or carrying out forensic tests that were missing from the 2007 inquiry. Officers found unexplained gaps in the investigation timeline and that there had been a complete lack of forensic examination of mobile phone activity in the area on the night Madeleine disappeared. Madeleine in an Everton football shirt before she disappeared. British officers face difficulty in breaking down resistance in Portugal to reopening the case . Madeleine McCann is seen how she may look as her ninth birthday approached in this computer-generated handout photograph released in 2012 . Mr Campbell said it was ‘perfectly probable’ that information which could identify the suspect responsible for Madeleine’s disappearance was already in the Portuguese files. He reiterated a claim that Madeleine could still be alive. He said: ‘You only have to look at the case in Cleveland, Ohio, and the European cases. Of course there is a possibility she is alive. But the key is to investigate the case and, alive or dead, we should be able to try and discern what happened.’ The McCanns, of Rothley, Leicestershire, have been kept closely informed of Scotland Yard’s review – codenamed Operation Grange – over the past two years. A spokesman for the couple said: ‘They have been encouraged from the moment the review started and are now greatly encouraged that police have drawn up a short list of people who they believe are of interest to the inquiry.’","British cleaners and Portuguese manual workers are among new suspects .

'Both victims are priests and the crime occurred in a living quarters attached to the church,' Officer Martos said. He said that the attacks took place outside of the church's inner sanctum. Father Terra managed to call 911 after the attack. In the early hours of Thursday, parishioners gathered to pray outside the Mother of Mercy Mission Church. Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton said that the attacks on the two priests 'strikes at our core'. So far no suspects have been located and no motive established but investigators were looking at surveillance cameras from the area surrounding the church, which is near the state Capitol. Police were waiting to also speak to Father Terra to find out more about the assailants. Father Walker suffered a fatal gun shot wound and was pronounced dead at a hospital in Phoenix. Father Terra suffered severe injuries and hospital staff were stunned that the priest was still able to communicate with them, the police spokeman said.

"Elizabeth Edwards tormented herself by using video footage of Rielle Hunter and John as her computer screensaver so she could watch her husband's reaction to his lover again and again, according to Hunter's new book. Despite the pain the affair caused John Edwards' cancer-stricken wife, Hunter says she has no regrets 'following her heart' into the bed of a man who was married for 32 years. Just days before the release of the mistress' tell-all memoir, 'What Really Happened: John Edwards, Our Daughter and Me,' new pictures show Hunter on a North Carolina beach getaway with the disgraced politician and their daughter. Scroll down for video . Happy and at ease: Rielle Hunter says John Edwards late wife used video of them together as her screensaver. Here the scandal spent time together relaxing at a Figure Eight, North Carolina beach house . Beach body: John Edwards couldn't resist Rielle Hunter, even though it cost him his political career, and new photos of her on the beach give some clues as to why . Tell-all: Hunter was pictured with her daughter Quinn on a beach in North Carolina days before her book, 'What Really Happened: John Edwards, Our Daughter and Me,' is set for release . Hunter offers lurid details about the couple's sex life, especially the 'extraordinary,' sleepless night that she 'surrendered' to Edwards -- just hours after meeting him at a reception in a New York City hotel. She claims she wrote the lurid book for Quinn, the couple's four-year-old love child. Edwards denied she was his daughter for nearly two years. Hunter bragged that she played a role in destroying the 'myth' of John and Elizabeth Edwards, but says the book is part of her 'duty' to Edwards' three other children. People magazine has released an excerpt of the memoir, which is due out on Tuesday, that describes Elizabeth's tortured reaction to learning that her husband was having an affair with his campaign videographer. New woman: John Edwards played the family man on Father's Day, spending time with Quinn and Rielle at a rented beach house . 'Witch on wheels': Hunter is merciless in her criticism of her lover's wife, Elizabeth, who died of breast cancer in 2010 . 'Elizabeth requested all the tapes (I’d made of the campaign). She locked herself in a room to watch,' Hunter writes. 'On one tape she saw Johnny walking into a room and his reaction to seeing me. She apparently told him that he never once looked at her the way he looked at me. So she took that bit and put it on her computer as a screen saver in order to watch it over and over again. However, she praised her lover for 'standing up' to his wife when they argued about his affair. Elizabeth demanded to know how her husband could be attracted to someone like Hunter -- who has a history of cocaine use and was the inspiration for a sexually voracious, drug-addled New York party girl character in the 1988 novel 'Story of My Life.' Edwards reportedly responded: 'She makes me happy.' 'He was so strong, fearless, and hoest in every other area of his life, but when it came to her, he was incredibly weak,' Hunter writes. Elizabeth was battling breast cancer as news of her husband's affair and their love child hit the public. She succumbed to the horrific disease in December 2010. But Hunter shows only scorn for Elizabeth. She says she was controlling and abusive toward her husband, which drove him into the arms of other women. Hunter calls her lover's late wife 'venomous' and a 'witch on wheels.' 'Many people invested their hearts, their time and their energy into the image of John and Elizabeth Edwards. While this image wasn't exactly true, I did play a role in destroying this myth, and many supporters ended up feeling hurt, betrayed, and disillusioned,' she writes, according to Radar Online. She goes on to say the book is meant to tell 'the truth' about the affair to the public, but also to the three children, Cate, Emma Claire and Jack, that Edwards had with his wife. Forsaken: Edwards tore apart his family, which included two small children, Jack and Emma Claire, when his wife learned he was cheating with Hunter . 'I feel that I owe them the full story. I also believe that I have a responsibility to Johnny and his entire family to offer the truth,' she says. Hunter describes Edwards as cowed by his wife, an older woman who was an accomplished lawyer. Elizabeth Edwards and Hunter actually met at a campaign event in December 2006, while Hunter was working for Edwards campaign, before she learned of the affair. 'I introduced myself. Elizabeth did not look me in the eye. In fact, she appeared to be frightened,' Hunter writes. Hunter also met Edwards' two young children, at his insistence, just a month and a half after they started sleeping together. He brought Emma Claire and Jack, age six and eight at the time, to a mall -- without his wife -- where he introduced them to his new mistress. Taking responsibility: After denying she was his daughter for two years, Edwards is spotted spending quality time with his 'precious Quinn' Hunter claims she quickly won both children over after they went to a Cold Stone Creamery for ice cream. Elizabeth finally kicked Edwards' out of the house and formally separated from him in December 2009 when Edwards was about to undergo dental surgery. The final straw for the publicly-humiliated wife was her husband's demand to see Quinn, his love child, before doctors sedated him. 'Johnny had had enough and took the first step toward taking control of his own life,' she writes.","Tell-all memoir, 'What Really Happened: John Edwards, Our Daughter and Me,' is due out on Tuesday .

Release of the film comes as a French survivor today claimed that panicking crew were already 'fleeing in their life jackets' before passengers were warned the cruise liner was sinking. Pensioner Daniele Perruchon also said men shoved past children screaming 'I don't want to die' as they raced to save themselves aboard the sinking ship. Scroll down to see video...

Search: The scale of the drop passengers endured on a safety rope can clearly be seen in this picture of the Costa Concordia, taken on Sunday . The 68-year-old was travelling with an elderly friend celebrating her 80th birthday when the chaos erupted on Friday night. But she said they were abandoned in the darkness as the giant ship listed after striking rocks off Italian island of Giglio. She and her friend were having dinner when the lights went out and crockery began crashing around them, she told French newspaper Nice-Matin. She said: 'At that point a loud speaker announcement in Italian said 'The electrical circuit of the stabilizers has cut out. This is not a problem'.

'Then as we were waiting in the gloom we saw terrified staff dashing past us in their life jackets. People were shouting and pushing each other. 'I was with an elderly person and determined not to panic. We made it back to our cabin and got our life jackets, then managed to reach one of the decks. 'Then we felt the ship begin tipping over. There was mass panic. The ship was at a steep angle and people were trying to reach the life boats by clinging to the walls. 'A woman fell on me and we went crashing into a telephone cabin. We managed to get into a life boat but it was unable to launch, and we were eventually taken off it by the Italian coastguard.' But she added: 'At no time did anyone come and help us. We felt abandoned. So much for women and children first. Abandoned: The Costa Concordia leans on its side just outside Giglio harbour last night . 'I heard children crying out 'I don't want to die' as men pushed past trying to get themselves off the boat.' Mrs Perruchon, from the French Riviera resort of Menton, said the cruise had been meant as a 'dream holiday' for her and her elderly friend. She said: 'We have decided the first thing we are going to do is get straight back on another cruise liner to beat the fear.' Rescuers have found six people dead inside the ship and are still searching for 29 people who remain missing from the 4,200 aboard. They include five-year-old Italian girl Dyana Arlotti and her father William, 34, who are  feared drowned after the vessel ran aground. Grounded: Oil removal ships patrolled near the cruise ship Costa Concordia last night . Mr Arlotti, 34, from Rimini, who is . divorced from Dyana’s mother, had taken his daughter on the cruise with . his current partner as a treat. Yesterday Dyana's distraught mother Susy Albertini told of her frantic search for news of her daughter. She said: 'I’ve made hundreds of calls to my . ex-husband’s mobile phone but there is no answer. ‘I called . all the authorities, the police, the town hall and the fire brigade but . no one knows anything . ‘The last time I saw Dyana was on . Thursday morning. I took her to nursery. Her father picked her up in the . evening. It’s not the first time that she’s gone with her dad on a . cruise – they both enjoy it. Dyana was happy when she left. Missing: Barbara (left) and Gerald Heil (right), of White Bear Lake, Minnesota, are still unaccounted for after the disaster . ‘They boarded the ship on Friday in .

Frenchman Francis Servel, 71, insisted his wife Nicole take his . lifejacket before they leapt off the sinking cruise ship into the sea. ‘For an hour we had waited in line to . get into a lifeboat – my husband let everyone else go first,’ said Mrs . Servel, a 60-year-old grandmother, back at home in Toulouse. ‘I can’t swim so he gave me his . lifejacket. ‘He shouted “Jump, jump, jump”. 'I froze and couldn’t jump, . but he jumped off the ship and shouted upwards, “Come on, don’t worry”. ‘I jumped off and the last thing I heard him say was that I would be fine. I never saw him again.’ She managed to swim ashore while her husband was swept under water and drowned. During her time in the cold water, she . said, ‘I thought of my children and grandchildren. 'The thought of them . kept me afloat, kept me living. I don’t know how I did it. ‘I swam for several minutes and then I found myself on a rock. ‘Villagers came to pick us up.

"Dwindling numbers: The Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams, holds the King James Bible, which celebrates its 400th anniversary this year. He has been urged by David Cameron to speak up for Christianity . Christianity is slowly, but surely losing ground in England and Wales, according to an official survey yesterday. The number who declare themselves to be Christian has dropped by nearly 10 per cent in five years, while the number of non-believers is growing. The state research into race and religion also showed that Christians are less than half as likely to attend a place of worship as followers of other traditions. The Citizenship Survey showed that Christianity remains the faith of the great majority of the population. But its share dropped from 77 per cent to 70 per cent between 2005 and 2010. Over the same period the numbers who say they have no religion went up from 15 per cent to 21 per cent. The findings were published days after David Cameron’s speech on the importance of Christianity to Britain, in which he urged the Church of England and its leader, the Archbishop of Canterbury, to take a lead in restoring moral values. The Citizenship Survey is the sixth and last in its ten-year history. Labour launched the research effort in 2001 in the hope of charting levels of prejudice and neighbourhood tensions and finding ways to help ease them. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles ordered the end of the project earlier this year because ministers considered the £4million cost of each survey could not be justified. The findings were based on questionnaires answered by 10,000 people, with further groups of 5,000 ethnic minority members and 1,200 Muslims consulted to shore up findings among smaller groups of the population. Losing faith? Canterbury Cathedral (above) is the mother church of the Anglican Communion and seat of the Archbishop of Canterbury. But its significance appears to be diminishing as fewer people are declaring themselves Christian . Questions covered issues including fear . of crime, giving to charity, the state of neighbourhoods and experiences . of the downturn as well as matters of religion and race. The results on the decline of Christianity come at a time when many Christians feel that equality laws are attacking some of their core beliefs. Four test cases on the rights of Christians, including two involving people refused the right to wear crucifixes at work and two which centre on Christians who refused to acknowledge same-sex relationships, are to be decided by the European Court of Human Rights in coming weeks. The report said: ‘While Christianity . remained the most prevalent faith in England and Wales, between 2005 and . 2010 there was a steady decrease in the proportion of people who . identified themselves as Christian. ‘Christian people were much less likely . than all the other main religions to say that they practised their . religion, while Muslim people were most likely to practise their . religion.’ Disillusioned: The apparent decline of the faith comes as many Christians believe their core beliefs, such as being able to wear crucifixes at work, are coming under fire from equality laws . However there were signs that, as Christian numbers dwindled, their commitment increased. A third of Christians said they went to church regularly. The figure was 33 per cent, up from 31 per cent in 2005. Urging action: Mr Cameron spoke out recently to stress the importance of Christianity to help restore moral values . Fewer . than half the population now think racial prejudice is on the increase. In the two years to 2010, numbers who believe racism is getting worse . went down from 56 per cent to 47 per cent. The . authors of the survey, produced by the Communities Department, said: . ‘The positive shifts over time were generally observed across all ethnic . and religious groups, and were often most pronounced among minority . groups.’ Seven per cent of the whole population thought racial or religious harassment was a problem in their neighbourhood, and 4 per cent of people had actually experienced racial bullying, in most cases consisting of verbal abuse. This was down from 5 per cent in the previous year. Asian people broadly said they had suffered less racial harassment over the past two years. For example, among Pakistanis the numbers who said they had experienced racial harassment in the past two years dropped from 20 per cent in 2009 to 13 per cent last year. However, Caribbeans and Black Africans said their experience of racial harassment had risen.","Christians also less likely to attend place of worship compared to other religions, state survey reveals .

"Professor Tanya Byron says she is treating a growing number of child patients who are suffering stress from exams . Pushy middle-class parents who pressure their children to do well in school risk damaging their mental health, a leading psychologist warned yesterday. Professor Tanya Byron said a growing number of youngsters are so terrified of getting bad grades they suffer from  stress and never develop the ‘emotional resilience’ needed to succeed in later life. She claimed many children are effectively ‘brought up in captivity’ because their parents are too scared of letting them play on the street. Professor Byron, who specialises in child and adolescent mental health, delivered her warnings as millions of teenagers are in the midst of GCSE and A-level exams. She told Radio 5 Live presenter Richard Bacon that psychologists are increasingly treating young patients ‘who come from families where you wouldn’t predict that they would generally really struggle at a psychological level’. She added: ‘It’s a small number but it’s a growing number.’ Professor Byron revealed that she felt sorry for her own children, aged 16 and 18, because of the constant pressure they face. ‘I just think, “Oh, you poor things”. I mean it’s ruthless and it’s endless. It is continuous assessments and it is exams, it’s AS-levels. ‘There’s a lot of pressure on kids even without parents adding to it,’ she added. The 47-year-old who has presented TV programmes on child behaviour such as Little Angels, said: ‘We are a risk-averse society. I say children are being brought up in captivity. Kids nowadays have more managed lives. ‘You don’t really see kids on the . streets any more. I grew up in the 70s, I was out on my bike with my . mates. We took risks, we did things, we weren’t all supervised. 'Now . you see kids fear failure. They are not really given the opportunity to . take risk or experience challenge or fail at anything. Dr Byron warned that pupils are so afraid of getting bad grades that they suffer from stress, and are being brought up 'in captivity' by overly cautious parents . ‘So failure becomes a massive issue for them. They start to put themselves under so much pressure and that’s when they become vulnerable.’ Professor Byron said adolescents are particularly vulnerable to psychological pressures because their prefrontal cortexes – the part of the brain that controls rational thought, problem-solving and empathy, is not yet fully developed. She added: ‘A lot of children don’t get the depth of experience or the confidence in their learning or themselves that  they need. ‘I see a lot of children who lack emotional resilience… the ability to take the knocks of life, fall down and pick yourself up again, to think, “I made a mistake but, hey, let’s move on”.’","Professor Byron says pushy parents harming kids 'emotional resilience'

"It looked like a typical Sunday morning at any mega-church. Several hundred people, including families with small children, packed in for more than an hour of rousing music, an inspirational sermon, a reading and some quiet reflection. The only thing missing was God.Nearly three dozen gatherings dubbed 'atheist mega-churches' by supporters and detractors have sprung up around the U.S. and Australia - with more to come - after finding success in Great Britain earlier this year. The movement fueled by social media and spearheaded by two prominent British comedians is no joke. Scroll down for video . Attendees play a game with each other at the Sunday Assembly, a godless congregation founded by British comedians Sanderson Jones and Pippa Evans . On Sunday, the inaugural Sunday Assembly in Los Angeles, Calif. attracted several hundred people bound by their belief in non-belief. Similar gatherings in San Diego, Nashville, New York and other U.S. cities have drawn hundreds of atheists seeking the camaraderie of a congregation without religion or ritual.The founders, British duo Sanderson Jones and Pippa Evans, are currently on a tongue-in-cheek '40 Dates, 40 Nights' tour around the U.S. and Australia to drum up donations and help launch new Sunday Assemblies. They hope to raise more than $800,000 that will help atheists launch their pop-up congregations around the world. So far, they have raised about $50,000.They don't bash believers but want to find a new way to meet like-minded people, engage in the community and make their presence more visible in a landscape dominated by faith. British comedians Sanderson Jones, right, and Pippa Evans smile as they go over their presentation before the Sunday Assembly in L.A. on Sunday . Church choir: The British duo sing the song, 'Lean on Me,' by Bill Withers . Jones got the first inkling for the idea while leaving a Christmas carol concert six years ago. 'There was so much about it that I loved, but it's a shame because at the heart of it, it's something I don't believe in,' Jones said. 'If you think about church, there's very little that's bad. It's singing awesome songs, hearing interesting talks, thinking about improving yourself and helping other people - and doing that in a community with wonderful relationships. What part of that is not to like?' The movement dovetails with new studies that show an increasing number of Americans are drifting from any religious affiliation. The Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life released a study last year that found 20 percent of Americans say they have no religious affiliation, an increase from 15 percent in the last five years. Pew researchers stressed, however, that the category also encompassed majorities of people who said they believed in God but had no ties with organized religion and people who consider themselves 'spiritual' but not 'religious.' Congregants dance from their seats during the song filled Sunday Assembly in L.A. Sunday Assembly - whose motto is Live Better, Help Often, Wonder More - taps into that universe of people who left their faith but now miss the community church provided, said Phil Zuckerman, a professor of secular studies at Pitzer College in Claremont. It also plays into a feeling among some atheists that they should make themselves more visible. For example, last December, an atheist in Santa Monica created an uproar - and triggered a lawsuit - when he set up a godless display amid Christian nativity scenes that were part of a beloved, decades-old tradition. 'In the U.S., there's a little bit of a feeling that if you're not religious, you're not patriotic. I think a lot of secular people say, `Hey, wait a minute. We are charitable, we are good people, we're good parents and we are just as good citizens as you and we're going to start a church to prove it,' said Zuckerman. 'It's still a minority, but there's enough of them now.' That impulse, however, has raised the ire of those who have spent years pushing back against the idea that atheism itself is a religion. 'The idea that you're building an entire organization based on what you don't believe, to me, sounds like an offense against sensibility,' said Michael Luciano, a self-described atheist who was raised Roman Catholic but left when he became disillusioned. 'There's something not OK with appropriating all of this religious language, and ritual for atheism,' said Luciano, who blogged about the movement at the site policymic.com. A volunteer posts a sign at the Sunday Assembly, the godless yet spirited congregation . That sentiment didn't seem to detract from the excitement Sunday at the inaugural meeting in Los Angeles. Hundreds of atheists and atheist-curious packed into a Hollywood auditorium for a boisterous service filled with live music, moments of reflection, an ""inspirational talk"" about forgotten - but important - inventors and scientists and some stand-up comedy. During the service, attendees stomped their feet, clapped their hands and cheered as Jones and Evans led the group through rousing renditions of ""Lean on Me,"" ""Here Comes the Sun"" and other hits that took the place of gospel songs. Congregants dissolved into laughter at a get-to-know-you game that involved clapping and slapping the hands of the person next to them and applauded as members of the audience spoke about community service projects they had started in LA. At the end, volunteers passed cardboard boxes for donations as attendees mingled over coffee and pastries and children played on the floor. For atheist Elijah Senn, the morning was perfect. 'I think the image that we have put forward in a lot of ways has been a scary, mean, we want to tear down the walls, we want to do destructive things kind of image is what a lot of people have of us,"" he said. ""I'm really excited to be able to come together and show that it's not about destruction. It's about making things and making things better.'

"It is an astonishing new view of a unique nebula. Researchers have used NASA's Hubble Space Telescope to photograph the iconic Horsehead Nebula in a new, infrared light to mark the 23rd anniversary of the famous observatory.

Scroll down for video . The Horsehead Nebula as viewed at near-infrared wavelengthswith the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope. This thick pillar of gas and dust is sculpted by powerful stellar winds blowing from clusters of massive stars located beyond the field of this image. The bright source at the top left edge of the nebula is a young star whose radiation is already eroding the surrounding interstellar material. Hubble has been producing ground-breaking science for two decades since its launch aboard the space shuttle Discovery on April 24, 1990. During . that time, it has benefited from a slew of upgrades from space shuttle . missions, including the 2009 addition of a new imaging workhorse, the . high-resolution Wide Field Camera 3 that took the new portrait of the . Horsehead. The nebula is a favorite target for amateur and professional astronomers. It is shadowy in optical light, and appears transparent and ethereal when seen at infrared wavelengths. 'The rich tapestry of the Horsehead Nebula pops out against the backdrop of Milky Way stars and distant galaxies that easily are visible in infrared light,' said Nasa. The nebula is part of the Orion Molecular Cloud, located about 1,500 light-years away in the constellation Orion. The cloud also contains other well-known objects such as the Great Orion Nebula (M42), the Flame Nebula, and Barnard's Loop. It is one of the nearest and most easily photographed regions in which massive stars are being formed. Spot the horsehead: A new view from ESA's Herschel space observatory of the iconic Horsehead Nebula in the context of its surroundings. The Horsehead Nebula resides in the constellation Orion, about 1300 light-years away, and is part of the vast Orion Molecular Cloud complex. To the left, the panoramic view also covers two other prominent sites where massive stars are forming, NGC 2068 and NGC 2071. In the Hubble image, the backlit . wisps along the Horsehead's upper ridge are being illuminated by Sigma . Orionis, a young five-star system just out of view. Along the nebula's top ridge, two fledgling stars peek out from their now-exposed nurseries. Scientists know a harsh ultraviolet glare from one of these bright stars is slowly evaporating the nebula. Gas . clouds surrounding the Horsehead already have dissipated, but the tip . of the jutting pillar contains a slightly higher density of hydrogen and . helium, laced with dust.

"They were armed and brutal men who would fight to the death in front of baying crowds of thousands. Yet despite the horrific nature of being a Gladiator, their tales have inspired many budding warriors. And now, despite Gladatorial contests being banned in 325AD, men can train to fight like  Spartacus in an ancient Roman amphitheater - at the world's only Gladiator School. Scroll down for video . Tough: Men who fancy their chances as a Roman Gladiator can train to fight like Spartacus at the world's only Gladiator school . Battle: The Scuola Gladiatori Roma, in Rome, is the only school of its kind, teaching brave participants ancient Roman combat techniques . Difficult: Students at the school are put through their paces with a series of grueling agility, co-ordination, speed and strength tests . The Scuola Gladiatori Roma, in Rome, is the only school of its kind, teaching brave participants ancient Roman combat techniques. Students are put through their paces with a series of gruelling agility, co-ordination, speed and strength tests. They are then taught basic weapon skills before they are thrust into the arena in full metal armour to put their new skills to the test in a battle with their instructor. Ben Ince, from Men's Fitness magazine, was brave enough to take on the challenge at the school in Rome, where he was trained by head trainer Marcus Valerius. Speaking about the unique experience, he said: 'There haven't been any gladiatorial contests in Rome since Emperor Constantine outlawed them in 325AD, so I was unsure what exactly I'd be learning. 'First up was an assault course, consisting of ropes, benches and gauntlet of swinging sandbags hanging from a wooden beam. Warrior: Students at the school are also taught basic weapon skills . Difficult: This student learns some of the basic skills which Gladiators needed to know in order to survive . Preparations: The student hones his agility skills during his training . 'I do plyometric work during my usual gym sessions, so the rope and bench jumps weren't too challenging but navigating through the sandbags required plenty of agility and co-ordination.' As part of his training Mr Ince was introduced to The Carousel, a device with a rotating blade at ankle length and another at shoulder length. The aim is to duck and jump to avoid being hit by the blade. This device is similar to techniques used by gladiators to test strength but Mr Ince  said avoiding getting hit by one of the blades was no easy task. He said: 'All you had to do was duck and jump which sounded straightforward but it took all my strength to avoid getting tripped or hit in the face. 'I established a rhythm of jumping the low pole and ducking the high one, when Valerius suddenly changed direction. 'In the split second it took me to adjust, the low pole caught my heel and sent me crashing to the floor.' After the strength, co-ordination and agility drills, Mr Ince  was taken to the armoury for the second phase of Gladiator training - weapon skills. Action: This student looks ready for battle as he holds up one of his weapons . Banned: There have not been any gladiatorial contests in Rome since Emperor Constantine outlawed them in 325AD. But that doesn't stop people from still wanting to learn the basic fighting techniques . Impressive: This is the ampitheatre where the gladiators sometimes train . Trainer Valerius said it was during this part of the training where students were taught basic fighting techniques including how to use a sword and shield. He said: 'Gladiators mostly trained with a wooden sword called a Rudus, it's lighter and safer than a metal sword and it teaches you how to judge distance. 'You have to think about it like boxing, you have a variety of strikes or punches that you can use in different combinations to attack your opponent. 'Gladiators would spend hours a day training on it to refine their technique.' Having mastered basic fighting techniques, it was time for Mr Ince  to try the armour before going head-to-head with Valerius in the arena. Ben was dressed in full Gladiator armoury which included a wide rimmed helmet with the traditional long fin on top, a protective metal sheath for his sword, a short wooden sword and a large rectangular metal shield. Dedicated: Gladiators would often spend hours training every day in order to refine their technique . Tricky: Students are put through an assault course which consists of ropes, benches and gauntlet of swinging sandbags hanging from a wooden beam . He said: 'I returned to the courtyard to find Valerius holding the net in one hand and the trident in the other. 'Now try to attack me' he said. 'I shuffled awkwardly, wondering how on earth people fought like this at all, let alone for five minutes. 'Valerius struck my shield with the trident, knocking me down. I scrambled back to my feet but before I could fully recover he struck again, jabbing with the trident to stay out of range of my sword. 'He began to rotate the net slowly until, accompanied by a final thrust of the trident, he aimed for the top of my head. Hold: This shows weapons and armour used in the gladiator training . 'Before I knew what was happening I was skidding face-first into the sand as he dragged me down in one swift motion. He said if this were an actual fight, I'd be dead. 'It was an eye opening experience. Trying to use the moves I'd been taught while wearing all the armour and weaponry was difficult. 'It wasn't so much the weight, more having to carry it on specific parts of your body at strange angles. 'After only a few hours training, I was exhausted from the heat, aching from all the reps and sore from the all the cuts and bruises I'd picked up. 'I now have a newfound respect for gladiators who, despite their diet and living conditions - not to mention the constant fear of death - were able to train relentlessly day after day.'","The Scuola Gladiatori Roma is the only school of its kind .

"Controversial: Clive Burgess was given a £74,000 increase in his pension and a £20,000 salary rise after being promoted two months before retirement . A senior police officer retired two months after securing a promotion that boosted his taxpayer-funded pension by £375,000, it has emerged. Chief Superintendent Clive Burgess was made Assistant Chief Constable in November and given a £20,000 pay rise. But by January the officer was working his last shift after  significantly bumping up his retirement fund. It came just weeks before a colleague at West Midlands Police also left with up to £450,000 extra in a similar arrangement. Sharon Rowe completed her final working day in May – just five months after being promoted from Assistant Chief Constable to temporary Deputy Chief Constable. Altogether, the two promotions could cost taxpayers more than £830,000 in additional pension payments if the pair live to their average UK life expectancies. Yesterday it emerged that Mr Burgess, 48, was interviewed for the new role just eight days after the force said that he would have to quit in January under the controversial A19 rule, when he would have reached 30 years’ service. On November 11 he was promoted to Assistant Chief Constable, which exempted him from the measure – and boosted his annual salary from around £74,000 to £94,000. Taking into account his lump sump entitlement and an annual pension pot for a life expectancy of 78, it means he can rake in an astonishing extra £374,829. He officially retired on April 1 after owed holiday was taken into account. In Miss Rowe’s case – reported in the Mail last week – promotion saw her salary increase by 40 per cent to £140,000. That equated to an extra £83,493 lump sum and £373,280 annual pension, taking her total promotion-linked payouts to £456,773. Home: Mr Burgess, who lives in this £475,000 detached house in Coventry, is now believed to have secured a taxpayer-funded pension lump sum worth more than £350,000 . Like Mr Burgess, Miss Rowe, 50, also had time off owed for holidays and only officially retired last month. John Hemming, a Liberal Democrat MP in Birmingham, condemned the payouts as ‘common ploys’ to boost retirement packages across the public sector. The revelations also come at  a time when West Midlands Police is carrying out recruitment freezes in an effort to save £150million. The news of Mr Burgess's promotion comes a week after Assistant Chief Constable Sharon Rowe (pictured with David Cameron in 2011) was set for a £450,000 pension bonus seven months after being promoted . Ray Egan, 75, who worked for the force for . 28 years, added: ‘It is morally repugnant that these two senior . officers are being allowed to cash in large sums by hoodwinking the . powers that be. It is just sheer greed.’ Next year, pay reforms will see police pensions based on average career earnings instead of a final salary figure. West Midlands Police said both officers were promoted after a recruitment process led by the Chief Constable. Mr Burgess yesterday declined to comment at his detached home in Coventry. Boost: Mr Burgess's promotion earned him £49,333 in the two months before his retirement . The salary rise from £74,000 to £94,000 led to a huge boost to Mr Burgess’ pension pot and potential tax-free lump sum. Officers receive two thirds of their salary as annual pension upon retirement - but based on the best or highest salary year of their final three years. Mr Burgess’ final year salary was a combination of 225 days at the salary at £74,000 and 140 days at £94,000, working out at around £82,000. Under his Chief Superintendent salary, the senior officer would have received two thirds of his £74,0000 salary as an annual pension, working out at £49,333. But his final year promotion means his annual pension rocketed to around £62,666 - a rise of £12,700 per annum. Officers can cash in the maximum 25 per cent allowed of their pensions upon retirement, called commutation, to receive a lump sum and a reduced annual income. If Mr Burgess cashed in the maximum 25 per cent of his former Chief Superintendent’s pension, he could have banked a £276,878 lump sum and a reduced annual pension payment of £47,000. But his new final year salary means he can cash in the maximum 25 per cent and receive a £351,707 lump sum - an increase of £74,829. His annual pension would then be set at £47,000 - up £10,000 on his previous figure. That means if Mr Burgess had commuted the full 25 per cent of his pension by the time he reaches the average male life expectancy age of 78 he would have netted an extra £300,0000 annual pension. This includes an extra £4,829 lump sum bonus - taking his total promotion-linked payouts to £374,829. If the officer had not cashed in his lump sum and claimed his full £49,333 annual pension income on his old salary, he would have received around £1,479,990 million by the time he had reached 78. But after promotion that figure, without any commutation, would have risen to £1,879,980 - a rise of around £400,000.","Chief Superintendent Clive Burgess was earning £74,000 a year .

"A German rapper who embraced radical Islam and travelled to Syria to fight with ISIS is overseeing the militant group's push to recruit Britons to come to the region and fight. Denis Cuspert, 39, who now calls himself Abu Talha al-Amani, is reported to have personally sworn an oath of loyalty to ISIS chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in April and has become the group's main propagandist. Like Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi Minister for Propaganda, he appeals to young, disillusioned people in Europe and provides an alternative ideology. Scroll down for video .

He is pictured in Bonn, Germany, in 2012 (right) Cuspert is a Muslim convert who holds previous prison convictions and was born to a German mother and a Ghanaian father in Berlin. Cuspert spent several years as a major player in the Berlin hip hop scene under the name 'Deso Dogg' before embracing radical Islam and travelling to join ISIS in Syria. He now oversees the group's sophisticated media operation and is reportedly using British fighters in an attempt to attract even more of their countrymen to the war-torn region. It is understood he leads a unit of German-speaking ISIS terrorists operating under the name 'The German Brigade of Millatu Ibrahim'. The rapper appeared in an ISIS beheading video and was seen holding the severed head of a man who he claims fought the terror group and as a result 'received the death penalty'. Another man in the video explains in Arabic that the victims were members of Syria's al-Sheitaat tribe, a group of about 70,000 Sunnis who are fighting ISIS.

"An 11-year-old boy is reported to have fathered a child with the 36-year-old mother of a schoolfriend (file picture) An 11-year-old boy in New Zealand has fathered a child with the 36-year-old mother of his schoolfriend. The revelation has prompted sexual abuse counsellors to call for a reform in the country's rape laws after details of the case first emerged when the boy informed the principal at his school, in South Auckland. The schoolboy and the baby are now both believed to be in care and Justice Minister Judith Collins has said she will look into present legislation which makes it impossible for a woman to be accused of rape. She said the case raised an 'important point', adding: 'I will seek advice from officials on whether or not a law change is required,' The Weekend Herald has reported. The current law states only a man can be accused of rape when they force sex. Women who have sex without consent can be charged with sexual violation. Both carry a maximum sentence of 20 years. Child Youth and Family confirmed it was dealing with a case at the school which was going before the courts. The paper has reported the boy approached his principal about two-thirds of the way through the 2012 school year. The contact is understood to have started in April last year when the boy and his friend took a day off school. They spent the day at the friend's home where the woman gave the boy alcohol and took part in a sexual encounter with him. It is understood the contact lasted for a number of months and the boy had turned 12 by the time the child was born. 'I will seek advice from officials on whether or not a law change is required' - Justice Minister Judith Collins . A CYF worker, who has since retired, told the paper the agency was involved in the case, adding the police would also be making inquiries, although the woman denied the sexual contact. Ken Clearwater, manager of Male Survivors of Sexual Abuse, said if the allegations were true the woman should be held accountable, adding the gender-dependent laws should be changed. Meanwhile, family lawyer Jeremy Sutton said the boy would not have rights to the child unless he was present at birth and that he would have to make a case for access. MailOnline yesterday reported how an elementary school teacher and mother-of-two, from Southern California, admitted performing sex acts on a student under the age of 14, claiming it was brought on by a manic episode. Malia Brooks, 32, pleaded guilty on Thursday to three counts of committing lewd acts with a child under 14, despite pleading not guilty the day before. Under the plea change deal, she'll face up to 12 years in prison instead of a possible 16. Her lawyer is seeking a four-to-six-year sentence.

"A young mother has told of how she was forced to defend herself with a knife when a man tried to enter her home during a seven hour outage of 911 phone services in Washington State. Alicia Cappola of Everett, Washington, was woken up by a man banging aggressively on her front door in the early hours of Thursday last week. Worried about her two young twins asleep in the other room, she phoned 911, but despite trying 37 times she was unable to get thought to emergency services. Attacked: Alicia Cappola of Everett, Washington, tried calling 911 more than 35 time, to alert police about the man trying to break into her home, but was forced to threaten the midnight intruder with a kitchen knife until he left . Ms Cappola kept trying 911, but explains that it continued to ring busy during the ten minutes the man was stood on her doorstep, attempting to get in. She says she made 37 calls about the intruder breaking into her home, but in the end was forced to drive him away herself with a knife. ‘I thought I had done something wrong because 911 is never busy and you know, tried it a couple more times,’ she told Huffington Post. ‘He stopped banging on the door after about ten minutes and ripped a screen off a window on my front porch and unfortunately the window was unlocked. ‘Then he came through the window I grabbed a knife in my kitchen and went toward him and told him to get out.’ The seven hour outage of 911 phone services in Washington state was blamed on a maintenance issue (stock image) The man, who according to Ms Cappola appeared to be under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol, left after she was able to convince him that this was not his home. She was later able to get through to 911 services and police arrived around 3am – over an hour after the man began his attempt to get through her door. CenturyLink says the seven-hour outage in Washington state 911 service early Thursday was caused by a technical error by a third-party vendor. In a statement Friday, the company said the vendor worked with CenturyLink to resolve the issue ‘as quickly as possible.’ The company said a similar, shorter 911 outage about the same time in Oregon affected about 16,000 phone customers in Lincoln, Tillamook and Yamhill counties. CenturyLink says that was caused by a maintenance issue.","911 services in Washington state cut off for seven hours last week .

"The surname Khan is the most common surname among doctors, according to a top ten list . Next time you’re treated at hospital, chances are you’ll be thanking a Dr Khan. The Asian name is the most common surname of doctors registered in Britain, according to figures. Patel – from the Gujarat region of India – was the second most popular, and Muslim surnames Ahmed and Ali also made the top ten list. Smith and Jones featured on the list as the most common names of British origin. The rest of the list was made up by Williams, Davies, Thomas and Taylor. But the list does not indicate where the doctor was born or trained. While many will have come from abroad, a high proportion of those with Asian surnames are likely to be the British-born children of immigrants. The most common first names for male doctors are David, John and Andrew, while for women they are Sarah, Elizabeth and Helen. There are nearly 270,000 doctors registered with the General Medical Council regulator. Its figures show more than one third gained their primary qualification outside the UK, with the biggest numbers from India, Pakistan, South Africa and Nigeria. Nearly 35,000 were trained in India and Pakistan. Since February 2012 there has been an 11 per cent increase in Pakistani-trained doctors registered in Britain, while numbers of Nigerian-qualified doctors have risen 8 per cent. There has been a 20 per cent increase in Bulgarian-trained doctors, and a 17 per cent rise in Romanian-trained doctors. But overall the proportion of foreign-trained doctors in Britain has fallen slightly by 1 per cent over 18 months. Britain saw an influx of Asian doctors in the 1960s and 1970s when the government invited medics from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh to solve an NHS staffing crisis. Since then many have come from other countries, particularly after Labour increased NHS funding from 1997. Khan - which means ruler or leader - is a surname with Mongolian-Turkic roots which is now mainly found in Islamic communities in Pakistan and Afghanistan. It is common among the Pashtuns of South-Central Asia, but is also used by Bengalis, Mughals and Muslim Rajputs. According to the British Surnames database, Khan is the 24th most common surname in the United Kingdom. In Iran and parts of the Indian subcontinent it is used as an honorific title after a person’s name. Patel - which means inn keeper - is a surname of northern Indian origin mainly used by Hindu groups whose ancestors belonged to the Landlords community. The name Patel is found primarily in the Indian state of Gujarat, but is also found in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and metropolitan cities like Mumbai and Delhi. According to the British Surnames database, it is the eighth most common surname within the UK. It is the third most common in the Greater London region. But in recent years there have been concerns some may have poor language skills and less thorough training. Foreign-trained doctors are also more likely to be struck off than British doctors. Last year 75 per cent of those struck off had been trained overseas. Doctors from abroad must pass an English language test and the GMC’s Professional and Linguistic Assessment Board test, designed to ensure they have the same level of medical knowledge as UK graduates who have completed their first foundation training year. Niall Dickson, chief executive of the GMC, said: ‘Doctors from all over the world have long come to work in this country and have in many areas kept the NHS going. We owe them a great deal. Our job is to make sure those who gain entry have the knowledge and skills to practise safely here.’","Muslim surnames Ahmed and Ali also make the top ten in 6th and 9th place .

"For most of us, starting a family comes after marriage and meeting a man but as a new study has revealed, that is no longer always the case. The number of single women opting to make their dreams of motherhood a reality using IVF has doubled, with 632 women choosing to go it alone in 2012 compared to just 259 in 2007. Donor insemination has also become a popular option, with 468 women choosing that route to motherhood in 2012 according to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority [HFEA]. Increase: Between 2007 and 2012, the number of single women undergoing IVF treatment doubled . Going it alone: More women are choosing to take control of their fertility and opt for single motherhood . In total, 47,800 women had IVF treatment in 2012; 2.3 per cent of whom were singletons, while three per cent involved women in same sex relationships. Experts have put the rise in singletons going it alone down to women becoming more willing to take responsibility for their own fertility. Speaking to the Sunday Times, Professor Geeta Nargund, medical director at Create Fertility, a private fertility clinic, said: . 'Women are taking control of their own reproduction as much as they took control when the oral contraceptive pill was introduced. 'We are seeing [everyone from] affluent career women to women who have no money and their parents or grandparents are paying for them.' But it seems not everyone is pleased by the development, with Dr Peter Saunders, head of the Christian Medical Fellowship, an anti-abortion evangelist organisation, admitting to having some concern about the impact growing up in a single parent family has on children. 'Many solo parents do a sterling job against tremendous odds but for the optimal environment for the emotional and spiritual development of children is to be with two married parents of the opposite sex to whom they are biologically related.' Others said that the importance to a child of having a father is frequently underestimated and should be taken into account. 'Around a quarter of families don't fit the traditional mum, dad and children, all living in the same house model,' said Adrienne Burgess, joint chief executive at the Fatherhood Institute. Concern: Some experts worry that bringing children up without fathers could have negative consequences . Big step: IVF and donor insemination have both become increasingly popular among single women . 'In around half of the apparently ""father absent"" homes, the child's birth father is playing a huge part in his child's life. 'Where fathers are truly absent, children are likely to need extra support.' Despite the warnings, singletons, among them neonatal nurse Naomi Watson, 35, from West Yorkshire look set to continue going alone in pursuit motherhood. Watson, now the mother of 14-month-old twin boys Albert and Arthur, says life as a single mother is tough but rewarding. 'I'd never met the right man,' she explains. 'I went to the clinic to check my fertility and it was low so I decided if I hadn't met a man within a year, I would do it on my own.' 'My boys can find out who their dad is when they are 18 and I wouldn't have done it if I didn't have that option,' she adds. 'It's hard and financially difficult but I knew it would be.'","Single women now make up 2.3% of those having IVF treatment .

"Investigation: The entire adult male population of Larmor Baden (pictured) are to be DNA tested in a bid to identify a firebug who has destroyed eight properties over the past year . The entire adult male population of a small village in northwest France are to be DNA tested in a bid to identify a firebug who has destroyed eight properties over the past year, including holiday homes rented out to British tourists. Four hundred Frenchmen aged between 15 and 75, representing half the population of Larmor Baden, on the coast of southern Brittany, will be asked to give saliva samples to forensic Gendarmes this week who will go from to house in a bid to trace the culprit. Their genetic profiles will be compared with DNA found by investigators at the scene of one of the blazes. The firebug first struck just over a year ago when three holiday homes went up in smoke leading investigators to suspect racist attacks. Then the village Post Office and another holiday home were torched. Since then a garage, a bar  and an ancient presbytery owned by the village have been targeted. A spokesperson at the Village Hall refused to link the attacks to racism saying the holiday homes were not British owned but only rented out to tourists including Britons. Mayor of Larmor Baden Denis Bertholom said that the attacks had created feelings in his village which varied from 'weariness to anger'. News of the mass DNA search sparked national headlines in France. It will be compared to genetic testing . of the entire adult male population of another small village in .

Forensic Gendarmes are trying to find a firebug who has destroyed eight properties over the past year on the island, including holiday homes rented out to British tourists . One hundred and seventy men aged between 15 and 35 were tested but the killer was only found five years later in Florida. Spanish drifter Francisco Arce Montes had crept into a Miami youth hostel and cut off a girl’s knickers with a pair of scissors. Montes was jailed in 2004 for thirty years in Rennes for murdering Caroline. The DNA tests at Pleine Fougeres were carried out at the insistence of Caroline’ s father John Dickinson who campaigned relentlessly for justice for his daughter. The DNA testing programme is being compared to the hunt for the killer of Caroline Dickinson, who was raped and murdered while on a school trip in France in 1996 .","Four hundred Frenchmen aged between 15 and 75 will be tested .

"A couple has lost their bid for compensation from a travel agent after they said their holiday to Turkey was ruined by the call to prayer from a nearby mosque. The man and woman, who have not been named, demanded half of the £1,900 they spent on the all-inclusive break, claiming they were disturbed by the sound of the Adhan repeated five times a day. They alleged their holiday, to the Turkish town of Doganbey on the Aegean coast, was ruined by the 'noise', which summoned Muslim worshippers to prayers from a loudspeaker mounted on a nearby mosque from 6am. Call to prayer: The claim said the 'noise' of the Adhan, from local mosque, ruined the couple's holiday . The German couple filed the complaint against a travel agent in Hannover, saying they were not able to relax at the five-star Angora Beach Resort Hotel. And they wanted the compensation to reflect there was an armrest missing from their chair on the flight to Turkey, and they had to endure a bumpy landing on the return journey. However, the complaint was last week dismissed by Hannover district court, which found the travel agent, that has not been named, was not at fault. The ruling added that the couple should have expected to be exposed to the sounds of the call to prayer due to the hotel being the centre of town – and said it was a local feature akin to the ringing of church bells in Germany. Popular destination: Izmir in Turkey, near where the couple was staying . ‘The complainants should have taken this authentic sound into account while booking for the resort,’ the court said. ‘The call to prayer is customary in Turkey and is comparable with church bells in a Christian country,"" the court said, according to newspaper The Local. ‘This does not constitute a deficiency of service.’ The court also ruled that the bumpy . landing was due to the weather, something that was beyond the control of . the tourism company. ‘Since any landing is dependent on the weather conditions, over which the air carrier has no influence, flight passengers have to expect to deal with isolated cases of rough touch downs,’ the court added.","Couple claimed £1,900 all-inclusive holiday was 'ruined' by the Adhan .

"Two teenage sisters have been murdered in Pakistan after they were accused of tarnishing their family's name by making a video of themselves dancing in the rain. The girls, aged 15 and 16, are seen running around in traditional dress with two other younger children outside their bungalow in the town of Chilas, in the northern region of Gilgit. The sisters, named as Noor Basra and Noor Sheza, appear to break into dance and one even flashes a smile at the camera. Innocent: The teenage sisters were filmed playing and dancing outside their home . However, when the footage was circulated via mobile phones, it caused outrage in the conservative Pakistani town. Last Sunday the girls were shot alongside their mother in their home by five gunmen. Police are investigating whether the attack was arranged by the girls' step-brother, named as Khutore, who allegedly wanted to 'restore the family's honour' according to The Sunday Times. The sisters' other brother has filed a case against Khutore and the four other alleged accomplices who are now believed to be on the run. The girls were shot alongside their mother in their home by five gunmen in the town of Chilas . Last year four women are believed to . have been killed by tribal elders for dancing and singing with men at a . wedding party in the remote north-western village of Kohistan in . Pakistan. A tribal council . of clerics – known as a Jirga – reportedly condemned the women to death . for ‘fornication’ and staining their families’ names. Their . actions were said to have brought shame on the community, which frowns . on men and women dancing together or fraternising at all. Four women were believed to have been killed last year after tribal elders condemned them to death for dancing and singing . The Human Rights Commission of . Pakistan said at least 943 women and girls were murdered in 2011 for . allegedly defaming their family’s honour. According to women's rights group, the Aurat Foundation, about 1,000 'honour' killings take place in Pakistan every year. The statistics highlight the scale of . violence suffered by many women in conservative Muslim Pakistan, where . they are frequently treated as second-class citizens. Malala Yousafzai holding her backpack on her way to school in Britain . From a young age Malala Yousafzai openly spoke out about the importance of education growing up in the Swat valley where the Taliban bans girls from going to school. But her outspoken views led to her being shot in the head last year on her way home from class. After the assassination attempt in October 2012, the Taliban said she had been targeted because she promoted 'western thinking'. The shooting sparked outrage in Pakistan and her story drew global attention to the struggle for women's rights in Malala's homeland. Following the attack Malala was brought to the U.K. for treatment and spent several months in a hospital undergoing skull reconstruction and cochlear implant surgeries. Now rehabilitating in Britain, Malala is the youngest Nobel peace prize nominee in history. Michael Pietsch, executive vice president and publisher of Little, Brown, said: 'Malala is already an inspiration to millions around the world.' The 15-year-old recently signed a book deal worth a reported £2m and set up a charity to support the education of 40 girls aged five to 12 in the Swat valley who would otherwise be forced into domestic labour. Actress Angelina Jolie even pledged to donate thousands of pounds to the charity. Malala's book will tell the story about the traumatic event and her long-running campaign to promote children's education.","Noor Basra and Noor Sheza were playing outside their home in Chilas .

"It will be Devon’s answer to the Angel Of The North: a giant statue of a naked pregnant woman holding a sword above her head. The monumental sculpture – which is a full ten inches higher than its 66ft North East counterpart – is  the brainchild of controversial artist Damien Hirst, who wants to erect it in a car park at Ilfracombe harbour. Hirst, who lives in a £3.5 million farmhouse just outside the resort, has told local councillors they can have the statue on loan for 20 years if they grant him the necessary planning permission. Controversiial: Damien Hirst wants to erect a giant statue of a pregnant woman in a car park in Ilfracombe, Devon . Hirst’s idea for an ‘Angel of the West’ has already divided opinion and some residents in the town, which is a teenage pregnancy blackspot, have instead dubbed it ‘The Belly of the South’. But the proposal is expected to be given the go-ahead by councillors convinced it will attract hundreds of thousands of visitors. It would also be a boon for Hirst’s restaurant, 11 The Quay, which is just 100 yards from the proposed site. Planners will make their decision in September, and the sculpture, which currently exists in three sections, could be in place two months later. Ill-conceived? A mock-up of how Hirst's planned statue would dominate Ilfracombe harbour . Councillor Mike Edmunds said: ‘We have got to find new ways of attracting visitors. 'We are lucky to have an artist of Damien’s stature in the area and we want to start rebranding the town in the area of the arts rather than as just a traditional resort.’ Another councillor, Philip Webb, added: ‘It is going to make a big  difference to the town and the local economy. In his back yard: Damien Hirst lives in a £3.5million farmhouse just outside Ilfracombe . 'Damien wants to make a statement and this statue certainly does that. 'I think it’s a wonderful idea and I’d be surprised if anyone opposed it.’ The bronze finished figure, which has a stainless-steel frame, will hold a glass-fibre sword aloft and a pair of scales behind her back and stand on a plinth of law books, staring out to sea. The scales and sword are similar to those carried by the Statue of Justice on the roof of the Old Bailey. One local source last night said 47-year-old Hirst had added the books at the 11th hour to ensure it would be taller than Antony Gormley’s Angel Of The North, erected in 1998. English Heritage has no objection to Hirst’s sculpture, thought to be the latest part of his Virgin Mother series, on the edge of an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Historic buildings inspector Francis Kelly said: ‘This sounds like an important and thought-provoking project that would add a considerable amount of interest to Ilfracombe.’ But council planners may have reckoned without public opinion. Bobby Davies, 69-year-old social secretary of Ilfracombe Yacht Club, said: ‘Oh, please no. Tell me they’re not really going to do this. ‘People will come to look  at it – probably to have a good laugh at our expense. Given Ilfracombe’s past problems with teenage pregnancies I can’t believe this is so in-your-face. Overshadowed: The proposed statue would be 10 inches taller than Antony Gormley's Angel Of The North, erected near Gateshead in 1998 . 'Why couldn’t we have had a fisherman or a seafarer?’ Resident Maureen Lowe, 63, said: ‘About five per cent of local people will go along with this. You can bet it will be called the Belly of the South around here. 'Personally I quite like the statue but it’s just too big.’ Hirst was unavailable for comment last night. By PHILLIP HENSHER . Damien Hirst, once among the most exciting of young British artists, has seen his reputation challenged. Similarities: Hirst's proposed work resembles Paul Day's £1m statue, The Meeting Place, erected at St Pancras . Critics have described this summer’s exhibition of his still lifes as ‘deluded’ in its incompetence, while his Tate retrospective has received mixed reviews. Some have speculated that the prices  of his art in the auction  room are inflated and must soon collapse. Now he is proposing this giant piece which has the same naive awkwardness of any number of new public statues. It looks, in style, very much like Paul Day’s £1 million statue at St Pancras of lovers embracing, probably the ugliest statue in London. Councillor Paul Crabb thinks locals would be ‘delighted’ by Hirst’s statue, which will certainly be impossible to ignore. What has encouraged this sort of misguided thinking is the Angel Of The North –  a grand and unique image created by an artist, Antony Gormley, on peak form. All sorts of proposed rubbish has followed. Hirst’s soppy, banal and overblown statue has nothing in common with Gormley’s, apart from size. It looks like a small statue, made by an ordinarily competent worker in an uninteresting style, blown up to the size of a lighthouse. And I bet plans for selling reproductions to tourists are, by now, completely prepared.","Artist submits plans for a statue 10 inches taller than Antony Gormley's .

"Marine Corps officials announced Thursday that three women have become the first to ever graduate from its tough-as-nails infantry course - but it could be two years before they’re allowed to serve in an infantry unit. The three completed the 59-day course at North Carolina’s Camp Geiger and met the same grueling test standards as the men, but even as more jobs are opened to women across all military branches Marines Corps leaders say they need more time to study whether females are fit to serve as grunts. Now Pvt. 1st Class Julia Carroll, Pvt. 1st Class Cristina Fuentes Monternegro, and Pvt. 1st Class Katie Gorz will go on to serve vital roles, but their historic accomplishment will remain largely symbolic. Selfless selfies: The world was introduced to the women who would become the first to ever finish the Marine Corps' grueling course on Camp Geiger in this Instagram photo taken by Harlee 'Rambo' Bradford (center). Bradford was actually sidelined with an injury before she could finish the 59-day course . Historic: Cristina Fuentes Montenegro (left) and Julia Carroll (right) are two of the three women who the Marine Corps said Thursday have become the first to ever successfully complete the tough-as-nails, 59-day infantry training course . Victors: Private First Class Katie Gorz, 19, of St. Paul, Minnesota also completed the grueling course, the Marine Corps said Thursday . This despite having successfully endured a 12-mile march with an 80-pound pack and a variety of combat fitness tests such as timed combat shuttle runs, timed ammunition container lifts and tests that simulate running under combat fire. ‘Any force-wide changes to be made will occur only after we have conducted our research, determined the way ahead and set the conditions to implement our recommendations,’ Marine spokeswoman Captain Maureen Krebs told the Washington Post. The step comes as the Marine Corps continues to evaluate where women might serve in combat. Earlier this year, the Pentagon lifted the ban on women serving in combat jobs, but each of the service branches is developing how this might be accomplished. The Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps are looking at the standards required for serving in battlefront jobs such as infantry, armor and elite commando positions. They have until Jan. 1, 2016, to open as many jobs as possible to women, and to explain why if they decide to keep some closed. The common requirements for men and women for each job would be based on specific tasks. Military officials have said the standards will not be lowered in order to bring women into any combat posts. Fuentes Montenegro, 25, of Coral Springs, Florida admitted she found the process difficult. ‘Our instructor, he told us all it takes is everything you got, and it’s true,’ she told the Military Times. ‘Once you are committed to a goal, you can make it if you put everything into it.’ Symbolic only: Despite their historic accomplishment, the women will not be joining an infantry unit because the Marine Corps has yet to okay that job for females . 18-year-old Julia Carroll of Idaho Falls, Idaho doesn’t think what she’s done is much to write home about. ‘I don’t really feel anything special just because, [the male graduates] did the same thing that we did, and a lot of them did it better than us,’ she said. ‘I don’t feel any different from them, I don’t think.’ Katie Gorz, 19, of St. Paul, Minnesota declined an interview with the Military Times. Another woman, Harlee ‘Rambo’ Bradford will likely become the fourth female graduate once she recovers from a leg injury and if she can pass the final Combat Fitness Test and Physical Fitness Test. On its website, the Marine Corps said the Camp Geiger course is the follow-on training for Marines who graduate from basic training at Parris Island, S.C., and about 20,000 Marines train there every year. Marines who complete recruit training at the post near San Diego move on to the infantry school at Camp Pendleton in California. Rare honor: Fuentes Montenegro smiles at a male recruit. She was one of 15 women who showed up on day one. Only three completed Camp Geiger's grueling 59-day course . Uphill battle: Earlier this year, the Pentagon lifted the ban on women serving in combat jobs but even as the three women made history the Marine Corps said the ban remains on women in infantry units . Parris Island is the only site where female Marines go through basic training. Carey said 15 women began the enlisted course with 254 men in September. It wasn't immediately clear exactly how many male Marines completed the course to graduation on Thursday. She said the course is separate from one that trains Marine infantry officers for leadership positions at Quantico, Virginia. Several women lieutenants have attempted to complete that course, but so far none has passed. A new group of enlisted Marines enters the infantry course every two weeks, and each of the units currently in training has women in them, Carey said. Under a 1994 Pentagon policy, women . were prohibited from being assigned to ground combat units below the . brigade level. A brigade is roughly 3,500 troops split into several . battalions of about 800 soldiers each. Historically, brigades were based . farther from the front lines, and they often included top command and . support staff. Last . year the military opened up about 14,500 combat positions to women, most . of them in the Army, by allowing them to serve in many jobs at the . battalion level. The January order lifted the last barrier to women . serving in combat, but allows the services to argue to keep some jobs . closed. The bulk of the . nearly 240,000 jobs currently closed to women are in the Army, . including those in infantry, armor, combat engineer and artillery units . that are often close to the battlefront. Similar jobs in the Marine . Corps are also closed.

"The world's oldest works of art have been found in a cave on Spain's Costa del Sol, scientists believe. Six paintings of seals are at least 42,000 years old and are the only known artistic images created by Neanderthal man, experts claim. Professor Jose Luis Sanchidrian, from the University of Cordoba, described the discovery as 'an academic bombshell', as all previous art work has been attributed to Homo sapiens. Important find: These six paintings of seals were discovered in the Nerja Caves near Malaga, Spain. They are at least 42,000 years old and are the only known artistic images created by Neanderthal man . The paintings were found in the Nerja Caves, 35 miles east of Malaga in the southern region of Andalusia. Spanish scientists sent organic residue found next to the paintings to Miami, where they were dated at being between 43,500 and 42,300 years old. They hope to establish the exact age by testing parts of the paintings themselves, but their investigation has been hampered by a lack of cash. Antonio Garrido, in charge of preserving the caves, said the paintings could revolutionise our view of Neanderthal man, who is often portrayed as being monkey-like. The Nerja Caves, an impressive series of enormous caverns, were discovered in 1959 by five boys out exploring. They are home to the world's largest stalagmite, standing 105ft (32m) tall. Underground: The Nerja Caves, an impressive series of enormous caverns, were discovered in 1959 by five boys out exploring . Tourist attraction: The caves are home to the world's largest stalagmite, standing 105ft tall . Neanderthals lived in the caves before becoming extinct about 30,000 years ago, leaving behind flint tools. Later, prehistoric Homo sapiens used the caves, painting on the walls and leaving pottery, tools and skeletons. Neanderthals, who were known to eat seals, are thought to have died out from competition with Homo sapiens, although scientists recently suggested they were wiped out by climate change. Previously the oldest works of art in the world were said to be 32,000-year-old images in the Chauvet Cave in southern France.

American journalist James Foley before he was kidnapped in November 2012 . 'It was like watching the murder of Lee unfold all over again. 'My heart broke looking at the pictures of his mum and dad.

Drummer Rigby, 25, was hit by a car and then dragged into the road by two Islamist fanatics in Woolwich, southeast London, in May last year. Michael Adebolajo, 29, and Michael Adebowale, 23, set about him with knives and a meat cleaver in a bid to cut off his head. They had claimed that they were 'soldiers of Allah' and were motivated by the plight of Muslims abroad to carry out the killing.

Adebolajo was born in Lambeth, south London, to a Christian family and educated in Romford, Essex. Adebowale was also born in the capital into a Christian family.

Mrs Rigby, 47, told The Sun that she cannot erase the memories of Lee's brutal murder from her mind and fears that the Foley family will be going through the same agonies. On Tuesday terror group Islamic State (IS) released a video showing Mr Foley on his knees reading an anti-American rant before he was decapitated by what is believed to be an English jihadist. The video is available online although Scotland Yard has threatened to arrest anyone who watches it or passes it on. Mr Foley's parents John and Diane have also asked people not to watch it. Diane and John Foley talk to reporters outside their home in Rochester, New Hampshire. Their son, James Foley was abducted in November 2012 while covering the Syrian conflict. Islamic militants posted a video showing his murder on Tuesday. The Foleys have asked people not to watch the video .

"A husband who fled the Middle East for Britain murdered his wife and buried her body next to a lay-by after he felt 'insulted' at her leaving him to become more Westernised, a court heard. Syrian-born Ahmed Khatib, 33, became resentful of mother-of-three Rania Alayed, 25, after she instructed a lawyer to help 'free her' from him, it was said. She caused further anger by attending college and meeting male and female friends before beginning a relationship with another man she met over the internet. Ahmed Khatib, pictured right,  is alleged to have murdered his wife Rania Alayed, left, and buried her body next to a lay-by after he felt 'insulted' at her leaving him to become more Westernised . After a family summit meeting failed in a bid to get the couple back together Rania was lured to a tower block in Salford, Greater Manchester where she was killed and her body stuffed in a suitcase, it was alleged. Khatib and his brother Muhaned, 38, were then said to have transferred the body to the back of a motorhome before driving to the A19 near Thirsk North Yorkshire where she was buried by the roadside. The remains of the victim have never been found. Later after Khatib was arrested he told psychiatrists she died after he pushed her during a row whilst 'possessed of spirit.' He claimed he accidentally causing her to stumble, fall and bang her head. Police descended on a house on Knutsford Road in Gorton, Manchester where Ahmed Khatib was charged with murder following the disappearance of mother-of-three Rania Alayed . After Khatib, pictured, was arrested he told psychiatrists she died after he pushed her during a row whilst 'possessed of spirit.' He claimed he accidentally causing her to stumble, fall and bang her head, the court heard . Manchester Crown Court was told Khatib and Syrian-born Rania had married in December 1987 when she was just 15 and had three children together. Prosecutor Tony Cross QC said it was a 'love marriage' rather than an arranged one but only came about as Rania's sister was married to Khatib's brother. The couple fled the Middle East for Britain where Muhaned was already living but in 2004 Rania began confiding in friends her husband was beating her, it was said. Arthur Millwood Court, the Salford home of Ahmed Khatib's brother Muhaned, became the focus of police activity after Rania Alayed disappeared in 2013 . Mr Cross said a friend witnessed the aftermath of an attack and added: 'She saw Khatib angry like a monster shouting he would kill her. It became clear to her that he and his family were controlling of her.' 'It appears he was violent, sexually and physically and would force her to give him money. She told one friend she feared he would kill her. How right she was was. He was prone to anger and openly displayed. He was contemptuous of females. He was also jealous. 'She had the courage to free herself from him using a solicitor and began to become a little Westernised. She went to college and had friends, male and female. 'This was all too much. During this period she was making friends outside her family circle. No doubt this was deeply resented by the defendant and in all probability by the rest of his family. He was desperate to affect a reconciliation. 'The family were very angry she had had the audacity to go to Law and one member even contacted her solicitor. They were insulted by her recourse to law. They wanted her and her children back within the family fold. 'It was obvious to them she was not going to comply with their wishes. They believed she was establishing an independent life perhaps with another man. Therefore it was decided she should either be coerced to comply or be killed.' Rania's uncle tried to help and was urged to persuade his niece not to get a divorce but during a family meeting she claimed Khatib had raped her. Khatib also took her phone believing she was using it to talk to other men. Rania left the family home in Longsight, Manchester with the children to move to a hostel and later in May 2013 rented a property in Cheetham Hill. She had also formed a relationship with a married man she met through an internet site 'Who's here.' Rania was last seen alive on June 7 last year when she met a friend in Manchester's Piccadilly Gardens and told of a plan to drop off her three children with her estranged husband via Muhaned's flat for the weekend.

"Tragic Danni Tripp, 20, took slimming pills and suffered a heart attack . A cleaner died after taking DMAA slimming pills - the same supplement that a London Marathon runner took before dying of a heart attack on the course. Danni Tripp was killed when she took the pills - which was a caffeine hit equivalent to 40 cups of coffee - but was sent home from a hospital because a doctor failed to recognise how seriously ill she was. Danni took the dietary supplement Dexaprine - known as DMAA - after splitting up from her long-term boyfriend three days earlier, an Oxford inquest heard today. The 20-year-old had been on a night out with friends drinking lager, Jagerbombs - which contain caffeine - and Smirnoff Ices when she returned home upset in the early hours of the morning. She complained of feeling unwell to her mother Teresa Crowley 30 minutes later and was rushed to hospital, the hearing was told. However, a doctor could not find details of the substance on the hospital computer so sent her home within 75 minutes. But she suffered a seizure at home in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, just over two hours later on December 11, 2011. She was taken to the John Radcliffe Hospital, in Oxford, by ambulance for the second time that day, but died of a heart attack. The coroner said he would be taking up the issues with the hospital trust. Toxicology tests showed she died of caffeine and multiple drug toxicity according to consultant forensic toxicologist Mark Tyler. There was also 71mgs of alcohol in her blood - a moderate amount after the alcohol would have been broken down in her body. Danni (centre) took the slimming pills after splitting up from her long-term boyfriend three days earlier . Pathologist Dr Sanjiv Manek told the . coroner that Danni suffered a cardiac arrhythmia and an abnormal heart . rhythm due to the overdose. 'The heart cannot pump blood around the body in the normal way,' he said. 'Organs suffer as a result, including the brain especially,' said the pathologist. The inquest was told that Danni had come out of a two-year relationship with Damian Moore  just three days before the fatal incident. A doctor treating her said he had 'given in to the family's request to discharge her early.' Giving evidence, Dr Aquib Hafeez said the patient was 'hyperactive' when she arrived at hospital for the first time. But Danni seemed to come down from the high after about an hour. 'She had calmed down, her temperature was down, her family was willing to look after her, she had not taken paracetamol (along with pills). I gave in and agreed to it (discharged her),' he said. 'I was going to keep her in and observe her. They (the family) said if you're going to observe her why can't we take her home? 'I decided to go with them. They did not force me or persuade me. 'I could not find the drug on Toxbase and was going towards safety than toxic.' He said he had not come across caffeine overdoses as part of his clinical practice to this harmful effect. Marathon runner Claire Squires, pictured, collapsed and died less than a mile before the finish line of the London Marathon last year after taking DMAA . But he said he could have rung Toxbase, a phone service where a consultant is available to offer advice about drugs. The doctor was unable to find information about the drug under the hospital's online drug database. The inquest heard that Danni arrived at hospital just before 5.30am. She was discharged about 75 minutes later at 6.45am but returned by 10.17am and was pronounced dead at 11.56am. Nurse . Nash Rustom said he was unable to carry out his baseline observation . because of the patient's erratic behaviour when she was first admitted. 'She was really agitated and was trying to climb over the bedside,' he said. 'She was not verbalising. It was hard to understand. It was difficult to do my observation. 'I would normally check heart rate and blood pressure. It was hard. She was moving the opposite way.' Danni was unsteady on her feet so the hospital provided a wheelchair. Dr . Rick Pullinger, who treated Ms Tripp during her second visit to . hospital, said that supportive treatment may not have resulted in saving . her life. He claimed that observation or . treatment in the intensive care unit may not have been successful even . if it had been administered at an earlier stage. The hearing was told that Danni's boyfriend had purchased the DMAA diet pills over the internet. The pills were taken off the market in their current state in February, last year. Dexaprine is described as a 'popular stimulant-based fat burner' and the 'most potent fat burner available on the market'. It is meant to give the user energy and suppress the appetite, making it a key ingredient in strong diet pills and exercise supplements. The UK's medicines watchdog MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency) ruled last August that it is unlicensed and that all other DMAA containing products needed to be removed from the market to protect public safety. Although DMAA is not illegal to take or possess in the UK it is no longer licensed so cannot be sold. The decision followed similar warnings around the world, including in the US and Australia where a man died after buying DMAA online. DMAA, most commonly used as a workout aid or dietary supplement, can have a physiological effect on the body by narrowing the arteries and raising the heart rate, said the MHRA. This has been linked to suspected adverse drug reactions worldwide, ranging from shortness of breath to heart attacks. Oxfordshire Coroner Darren Salter said he would be writing to the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust to highlight the importance of having set protocol when certain drugs are not listed on a hospital's database. He will also write to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency to make them aware of the tragic case. There have been 17 deaths of this kind in America, but only Danni and Marathon runner Claire Squires are known to have died in the UK. Recording a narrative verdict, the coroner said: 'I do not intend to apportion blame. 'There was no evidence Danni Tripp had taken any illegal substances and she had no underling health problems. 'It is quite alarming considering how death is so rare from caffeine toxicity. 'After an evening drinking, Danni Tripp arrived back home in Abingdon. 'At 4am she took slimming pills. There was no intent to take her own life or any sign to harm herself. 'By about 5.30am she had arrived at hospital and was discharged home. 'At 8.45am her condition deteriorated. She arrived back at the hospital by about 10.20am. Time of death was given as 11.56am on December 11, 2011. 'She had suffered a cardiac arrhythmia due to caffeine toxicity.' He added: 'My condolences go to the family. I extend my deepest sympathies for their loss. This was an exceptionally sad turn of events. Speaking after the inquest a tearful Ms Crowley, who is a mother-of-four, said: 'Danni was a lovely girl, full of life, very caring, who was very much the party girl. 'I don't believe she knew what effect the pills would have had when she took them. There's no way she would have done that knowing the risks. 'The inquest has been very thorough, but it won't bring her back, will it?'","Cleaner had been on a night out with friends drinking when she returned home and took DMAA pills .

"For those of us who are tired, stressed or even downright exhausted, they offer a much-needed pick-me-up in an increasingly fast-paced world. But it turns out that just one cup of coffee picked up from a high street chain could contain ten times as much caffeine as a can of Coca-Cola. A snapshot survey of some of the most popular coffee shops and sandwich chains revealed that a large americano from Costa Coffee contains 370mg of caffeine. Choosing to add an extra shot of espresso would take the figure to above 400mg in a single cup. This is compared with the 32mg in a can of Coke, a drink already perceived as being high in caffeine. It is almost twice the daily caffeine limit recommended for pregnant women in the UK – and close to some countries’ threshold for healthy adults. Other coffees with high levels of caffeine include a large americano from Starbucks, which contains 300mg of the stimulant and a medium americano from Costa Coffee, which contains 277mg. UK health authorities advise women to take in no more than 200mg of caffeine a day during pregnancy. Posed by model . But the survey found that choosing the cheaper option and enjoying a hot drink at home could also help people cut down their caffeine intake. A mug of instant coffee made at home contained an estimated 100mg of caffeine, while a cup of tea only had around 75mg. Health authorities in the UK have not issued official guidelines on how much caffeine an adult should consume in a day. However they have released advice about how much caffeine a pregnant women should expose their baby to. Thanks to fears about birth defects, miscarriages and premature deliveries, they advise women to take in no more than 200mg a day during pregnancy. And in Canada, officials have suggested that adults should normally limit themselves to 400mg – meaning that just one cup of coffee from a high street chain could contain an adult’s total recommended daily allowance. Dr Alan Crozier, from Glasgow University, said: ‘This is clearly a problem. People at risk could unwittingly ingest far more caffeine than they would dream of.’ A spokesman for Costa Coffee said: ‘Customers are able to request a reduction in their coffee strength or order any of our drinks as a decaf option.’","Large americano from Costa Coffee contains 370mg of caffeine .

"The face may look familiar to viewers of the Channel 4 television show, King of the Hill. But salesman behind counters in Nottinghamshire failed to notice the cartoon character on the fake identity card was Bobby King. And the age given on the document was only 17. However in an undercover operation by trading standards, a teenager using this ID card successfully purchased alcohol six times. Fake ID card showing Bobby Hill from Channel 4 TV show King of the Hill . More than half of the 22 shops tested by the county council trading standards operation either served the teenager alcohol without asking for identification, or accepted fake ID, even though it identified that he was underage. A total of seven stores failed to ask for identification and six checked his false ID card but still sold him the alcohol. The council said it would issue advice to all the retailers who wrongly served the volunteer and encourage them to adopt a Challenge 25 policy when selling age-related products. The retailing strategy encourages anyone who is older than 18 but appears younger than 25 to carry acceptable ID, such as a card bearing the PASS hologram, a photographic driving license or a passport. Mick Murphy, the chairman of the council's community safety committee, said: 'We take the sale of age-restricted products to children very seriously. 'Although the volunteer was 18, we would strongly recommend that retailers always ask purchasers of goods such as alcohol and cigarettes for identification if they look under 25. Retailers are being encouraged to adopt the Challenge 25 policy when selling age-related products, requiring anyone who appears under 25 to carry ID . 'It is disappointing that around a quarter of the shops tested did not properly check the identification that they asked for before accepting it. We are warning shops that we are considering using a child with fake ID following the results of this exercise.'","ID shows Bobby King from King of the Hill .

"Addressing the issue: Teenager Chris Whitehead wore his sister's skirt to class in protest at his school's ban on shorts which he said was unfair . A 13-year-old boy who wore a skirt to school in protest at a 'discriminatory' uniform ban on shorts was today given a prestigious human rights prize. Chris Whitehead made headlines in May when he turned up for class in his younger sister's black skirt. He was taking stand against a rule at Impington Village College near Cambridge which allowed girls to change into skirts during hot weather, while boys had to swelter in long trousers. The Year 9 student said wearing trousers in the heat affected concentration levels and an ability to study in class. His campaign made it onto national television when ITV's Daybreak presenter Adrian Chiles showed his support by wearing a floral skirt live on air. Now the teenager has become a runner-up in Liberty's human rights young person of the year competition held at the Southbank Centre in London today. Chris, who is a member of the school's student executive, said: 'I didn't think it would be that influential, but I'm really happy. It was a good surprise to be nominated.' He had decided to take advantage of a 'silly loophole’ in the school's uniform policy which meant boys could wear skirts because the school would be guilty of discrimination if it tried to stop them. He said at the time: ‘Wearing a skirt is just like wearing shorts with a gap in the middle. I don’t feel silly at all. I don’t embarrass easily. ‘I will be wearing the skirt at school all day in protest at the uniform policy and addressing the assembly with the school council.’ Backing: Chris, who sits on the school's student executive, with supporters at Impington Village College. The school later vowed to review the uniform ban . The 1,368-pupil school, which was classed as good in its last Ofsted inspection in 2006, imposed the ban two years ago after a consultation  with parents and teachers. Its ‘Look Smart’ dress code stated students must wear ‘plain black tailored trousers or knee-length skirts without slits’ – but did not specify gender. The school later promised to review its decision. Chris, of Histon, Cambridgeshire, was the youngest nominee on the Liberty awards shortlist which includes Cerie Bullivant, who fought against government control orders, journalist and activist Zin Derfoufi, and Abigail Stepnitz of the Poppy Project for women.

"New long-term data on the melting of Earth’s polar ice is not the ecological death knell some might expect. A team of researchers led by Dr. Bert Wouters at the University of Bristol compared nine years of satellite measurements of glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica in an attempt to determine if the melt-off is part of an accelerating trend in ice loss and sea-level rise. While the study showed a loss of about 300 billion tonnes of ice per year from the arctic and Antarctic regions, it concluded that natural processes cannot be ruled out as the force behind the receding ice sheets and thus that future sea-level rise cannot currently be accurately predicted. No conclusions: A new study says we don't know enough about polar ice melt to say whether or not it is human-caused or if the sea-levels will rise as they liquify . The ice covering Antarctica and Greenland contains about 99.5 per cent of the Earth's glacier ice and would raise global sea levels by around 206 feet if they somehow melted completely. As such, the two ice sheets are the biggest potential sources of sea level rise and are of particular interest to scientists studying changes in sea level and polar ice mass. In order to measure changes in ice sheets on Antarctica and Greenland, the researchers used satellites to detect tiny variations in Earth’s magnetic field that are indicative of a change in the distribution of mass, in this case the movement of ice into the ocean. Long-term: Dr. Bert Wouters and his team analyzed 9-years of data from satellites that measured the melting of ice on Greenland and Antarctica . Beginning in 2002, researchers looking at sea level rise led by Dr. Burt Wouters used satellites to take monthly measurements of Greenland and Antarctica's glaciers--the largest potential sources of rising tides--in an effort dubbed Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE). The study found that the two land masses lost about 300 tonnes of ice to the ocean each year of the study. However, the 9-year length of the research was insufficient to determine if the melt-off was part of an accelerating trend (ie caused by humans) or part of an ebb and flow of natural processes. The study found it had almost enough data to conclude Antarctica's ice sheets are melting as part of an increasing trend with a 'reasonable level of confidence.' However, Wouters' team said another decade of data is needed before the same is true for Greenland. Since current ice melt data could indicate variable climate trends and aren't necessarily part of an accelerating trend, the study warned that predictions of future sea-level rise should not be based on measurements of glacial loss. Beginning in 2002, the study dubbed Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) took monthly measurements of the two ice sheets over the course of nine years. Published in the journal Nature Geoscience this week, the results of GRACE did show a rapid loss of ice. ‘In the course of the mission,’ said Dr. Wouters, who is currently a visiting researcher at the University of Colorado, ‘it has become apparent that ice sheets are losing substantial amounts of ice about 300 billion tonnes each year and that the rate at which these losses occurs is increasing.’ However, the study stopped short of pointing a finger at why the loss is occurring and could not determine if the melt is indicative of an accelerating trend caused by human activity. Non-human factors also play a role in glacier melt. Shifting North Atlantic pressure systems like El Nino and slow changes in ocean currents can also cause the ice sheets to recede. ‘So,’ Dr. Wouters said in a release, ‘if observations span only a few years, such 'ice sheet weather' may show up as an apparent speed-up of ice loss which would cancel out once more observations become available.’ The duration of the GRACE study, the researchers say, is nearly enough to show an acceleration of ice melt in Antarctica with a ‘reasonable level of confidence.’ However, it will take another decade of satellite measurements to conclude whether or not Greenland’s ice is melting at an increasing clip. Perhaps the most important conclusion from the study is that more long-term satellite measurements are vital in the effort to measure and predict future sea-level rise. Big melt: The study showed that some 300 tonnes of ice was lost in Greenland and Antarctica each year . Whodunnit: Despite apparently grim data, the study could not conclude if the ice melt that occurred since the study began in 2002 was a natural occurrence or man-made . Data on sea level rise, much of it extrapolated from glacial melt numbers, has led coastal countries and municipalities worldwide to undertake costly infrastructure modifications ahead of the rising sea. Just last month, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg painted a grim picture of his city's future in the face of rising tides and, he said, the increased likelihood of more events like 2012's devastating Hurricane Sandy. In a news conference in which he called the efforts 'urgent,' Bloomberg announced a $20 billion climate change readiness plan that includes moveable flood walls and levees designed to save the island city from the wrath of rising oceans. Meanwhile, Dr. Wouters and his team . warn that a lack of sufficient long-term measurements should preclude . the use of current ice loss numbers as predictors of future sea-level . rise. 'Therefore,' the . researchers said, 'climate variability adds uncertainty to . extrapolations of future mass loss and sea-level rise, underscoring the . need for continuous long-term satellite monitoring.' Tit for tat: Since the study revealed that not enough is known about glacial melt to determine a cause or trajectory, it concluded that future sea-level rises could not be predicted . More questions: The study showed that there may be enough data to show an acceleration of ice melt in Antarctica, but it will take a decade more data gathering to understand why Greenland's ice is melting .","Greenland and Antarctica have lost about 300 billion tons of ice per year of the 9-year study .

"Rock star Bruce Dickinson has revealed he is battling cancer. The 56-year-old Iron Maiden singer has had treatment for a tumour on his tongue, the band’s website says. The cancer was diagnosed during a routine check-up just before Christmas and Dickinson has just completed a seven-week course of chemotherapy and radiology. Dickinson, 56, pictured during a concert in Santiago, Chile, is being treated for cancer it has been announced . A seven week course of chemotherapy and radiology treatment was completed yesterday, the band said . Dickinson - who quit the band in 1993 only to re-join in 1999 - is known and loved for his on-stage energy . The band are due to go on a European tour from May 27 to July 5, but have urged fans to be patient. Hundreds of upset Iron Maiden fans from around the world took to Twitter to wish him a speedy recovery. The band said in the statement: 'Just before Christmas, Maiden vocalist Bruce Dickinson visited his doctor for a routine check-up. 'This led to tests and biopsies which revealed a small cancerous tumour at the back of his tongue. A seven week course of chemotherapy and radiology treatment was completed yesterday. 'As the tumour was caught in the early stages, the prognosis thankfully is extremely good. Bruce's medical team fully expect him to make a complete recovery with the all clear envisaged by late May. It will then take a further few months for Bruce to get back to full fitness. 'In the meantime we would ask for your patience, understanding and respect for Bruce and his family's privacy until we update everyone by the end of May. Bruce is doing very well considering the circumstances and the whole team are very positive.' The metal band finished a three-year world tour in July 2014 with a headline slot at the Sonisphere Festival . Iron Maiden, pictured in 2001, were formed in Leyton, east London, in 1975 and have sold 80 million albums . Dickinson - who quit the band in 1993 only to re-join in 1999 - is known and loved for his on-stage energy and wide vocal range. Last year he said he had boycotted Glastonbury for being too bourgeois. 'Personally I have no interest in going to Glastonbury,' he said. 'In the days when Glasto was an alternative festival it was quite interesting, but anywhere Gwyneth Paltrow goes and you can live in an air-conditioned yurt is not for me.' In September, the trained pilot took part in a mock fight above the grounds of Knebworth House to commemorate the start of World War One. Dickinson flew one of the planes in the display, which lasted for 15 minutes and ended with the Band and Bugles of The Rifles playing the Last Post just before Deftone's set on the main stage. Iron Maiden were formed in Leyton, east London, in 1975 and have sold 80 million albums and won multiple awards, making them one of the most successful heavy metal bands of all time.","Iron Maiden said in statement that Dickinson, 56, is being treated for cancer .

"A Christian couple who were sued after refusing to allow a gay couple to stay in a double room at their seaside guesthouse will be legally allowed to turn away unmarried couples after becoming an non-profit organisation. Peter and Hazelmary Bull found themselves at the centre of an international furore after telling civil partners Martyn Hall and Steven Preddy that they could not share a room at the Chymorvah Hotel in Marazion, Cornwall, on account of their religious beliefs. But now they will be able to turn away unmarried gay and straight couples from the Bed & Breakfast, which doubles up as their home, after becoming a not-for-profit organisation. Fined: B&B owners Peter and Hazelmary Bull, who were fined for breaching equality laws by refusing to let a gay couple share a room at their guesthouse, will be legally able to turn away unmarried couples after deciding to become a non-profit organisation . Guesthouse: The Chymorvah Hotel in Marazion, Cornwall, run by Peter and Hazelmary Bull . Mr and Mrs Bull were forced to pay £3,600 to the couple in a landmark case in 2011 after they were found to have discriminated against them on the grounds of sexual orientation under Equality Act regulations. The couple insisted that their policy of not allowing unmarried couples to share a bed extended to heterosexual couples as well as homosexual pairs. But the courts disagreed. The hotel is now to be turned into a respite care centre for Christians and anyone staying under their roof will now have to abide by the Bull's rules as long as they are set out in the company's articles. The Bulls have since taken their case to the Court of Appeal, where it was dismissed and have now had permission to have it heard in the country’s highest court, the Supreme Court. Mrs Bull, 69, said the incident had changed their lives. She said: 'We have been through the mill since 2008. It has stepped up since the trial. 'In 2010, when the trial happened it was given a lot of press attention because it was a precedent and also dealt with quite a touchy subject. Most people have quite strong feelings one way or another. 'We are not fanatics. We have often been portrayed as being bigoted. Controversy: The couple's Chymorvah House B&B will be reopened as a respite care centre for Christians . 'I am not homophobic. I have no problem with them - I have always thought of them as people and enjoy their company. It is just that we thought it would be wrong for here. 'It had nothing to do with homophobia. 'All the way through we have always said no unmarried couples; it just happens that homosexuals fit into that category ... it is a terribly difficult subject.' The Chymorvah has been struggling to attract guests since the Equalities Act was brought in 2007, meaning they are no longer able to be rated by Visit England because of their policies and therefore are unable to advertise in many of the guides that used to bring in the majority of their customers. Ruling: Steven Preddy (left) and Martin Hall outside Bristol County Court in 2011 after a judge ruled that they had been treated unlawfully . Mrs Bull says that the recession has added to financial difficulties and she has hope for the future. She added: 'We have come through two and a half years now and we are coming into a new chapter in that we are revamping this place and relaunching it.' Not only have visitor numbers declined, but Mrs Bull says that the couple have had death threats and sufferered vandalism. But she said that messages of support have far outweighed any negative correspondence since their day in court. She said: 'All we wanted was to be able to support marriage, to say no here. 'This (the result of the trial) is the men’s human rights and they come into a collision with our human rights. 'Nobody ever thought it through when this legislation was first brought in. 'Can’t somebody work out a formula that keeps them happy and us?' To try to encourage more people to stay, the Bulls are trying to innovate. The first event they have planned is an educational supper on the Jewish festival of Passover for Christians next Friday. They will also be offering branch line breaks from June, where visitors will be offered guided tours of the five branch lines in Cornwall. Mrs Bull said she hoped it would attract rail enthusiasts. As for the legal battle, the Bulls won permission in August to take their case to the Supreme Court and their case is set to be heard on October 9 and 10. The Bull's appeal will be heard at the Supreme Court in October.","Peter and Hazelmary Bull were fined in 2011 for breaching the Equality Act .

"A former BBC colleague of Jimmy Savile has claimed the predatory paedophile was a necrophiliac. It is one of the most extraordinary allegations to have come out in the wake of the scandal. The claim was made on Radio 5 Live today by Paul Gambaccini, who started working as a DJ on Radio 1 in 1973. Scroll down for video . Paul Gambaccini, left, made the astonishing claims about Savile, right, on Radio 5 Live today . Mr Gambaccini, 63, said he was aware of the necrophilia claims in the eighties. He questioned why newspapers had not acted when he said a reporter had boasted that his colleagues were aware of a story linking Savile to 'necrophilia'. His comments astounded presenter Nicky Campbell who tried to stop the conversation by warning the allegations were not in the public domain. Campbell said: 'That particularly lurid accusation that you have just brought to people's attention is one that has not been in the public domain.' Gambaccini agreed and asked 'why not?'. And he asked: 'Who vetted the knighthood? Coco the clown? He had worked with Savile at Radio 1 where he had first heard stories about his abuse of under-age girls. He said the BBC was not the only organisation at fault for failing to expose Savile, saying the press was equally to blame. He claimed a reporter was heard talking at a wedding 10 years ago about Savile being a necrophiliac. He said that he used a 'politically incorrect' term to categorise the people to whom Savile devoted his attentions. He said: 'The expression I came to associate with Savile's sexual partners was either one used by production assistants or one I made up to summarise their reports ... ""under-age subnormals"". 'He targeted the institutionalised, . the hospitalised - and this was known. Why did Jimmy go to hospitals? That's where the patients were.' Paul Gambaccini said the BBC was not the only organisation at fault for failing to expose Savile, saying the press was equally to blame. Mr Gambaccini . continued to say today that Savile's alleged abuse was taking place at a . time when staff failed to get to grips with the concept of paedophilia. 'It was considered so far beyond the pale that people didn't believe it happened,' he said during the 5 Live Breakfast Show. He . said the entire society was taken in by Savile - 'including the Prime . Minister who invited him to Chequers; including the royal family, . photographed with him, he got a knighthood in this country, he got a . papal knighthood. 'This is not just the BBC this is history, this is a man who conned an entire society,' Gambaccini added. It . also emerged earlier this month that Savile denied claims he was sexually attracted to . corpses in an interview in 1990, after he admitted taking pleasure in . taking the deceased to Stoke Mandeville Hospital mortuary. The hospital, where Savile worked as a volunteer and had his own room, said that it has never received claims that Savile 'inappropriately interacted' with corpses. A spokesman said: 'We are not launching an investigation into claims that Savile was a necrophiliac. We have never received any complaints as to that nature.' 'During our time, to the best of our knowledge, Jimmy was not given free access around our clinical areas and whenever he attended the hospital he would give advance notice and usually be in attendance with his fundraising team.' Admittance: Max Clifford and Petrie Hosken appearing on This Morning. Mr Clifford admitted he was aware of the abuse allegations about Savile because of his work on a story about convicted paedophile Gary Glitter . In the 1990 interview with Q magazine, The Sun reported Savile was given the job of taking the dead to the mortuary. Savile, who died last year at 84, said: 'One of my jobs is to take away the deceased. You can look after . somebody, be alone with somebody, who has lived a whole lifetime, and . I’m just saying goodbye and looking after him. 'That is a privilege and an honour. Some . people get hold of the fact that Jim likes looking after cadavers and . say, ""Aha, Jim’s a necrophiliac!’ I’m not a necrophiliac"".' In an interview on ITV's This Morning today Max Clifford admitted he was aware of the abuse allegations because of his work on a story about convicted paedophile Gary Glitter. 'Don't forget I was the one that broke the Gary Glitter story, and when the people that came to me to tell me about Gary Glitter, Jimmy Savile's name came up several times in those conversations. That was years ago... I passed it all on.' Asked by Phillip Schofield if he passed the allegations on to the police, Clifford replied: 'No, the people concerned. The people that came to see me. 'And two or three of the people that came to see me didn't then fulfil their story with Gary Glitter for their own reasons... it's up to the people concerned to go to the police. It's not for me to say. They're the ones that this happened to or experienced it or saw it.' He justified his actions saying you can not 'make someone go the police.' 'It's their lives, it's their future. The information doesn't stack up unless they are prepared to go to the police and explain it.' He also alluded to the fact other figures could be implicated in the scandal, with Clifford saying: 'Oh, there's lots of other people.'","Former BBC DJ said he was aware of claims in the eighties .

"Blame: Shadow transport secretary Mary Creagh said that Thomas The Tank Engine set a poor example to children . Thomas the Tank Engine has been blamed for a lack of women train drivers by the shadow transport secretary. Mary Creagh said it was a ‘national scandal’ that there were so few women drivers on the railways, but was ridiculed for saying that the popular children’s story was partly to blame. She said all the main characters in the original books – published in the 1940s – are male, and the only female characters are an ‘annoyance, a nuisance and in some cases a danger’ to the railway. ‘There is a preponderance of men in the transport industry and I am very keen to unpack some of the myths that stop women from taking up what are often highly-paid and highly-skilled jobs,’ she said. Her remarks led Rob Wilson, a Tory MP, to suggest that Thomas’s creator, the Reverend William Awdry, ‘forgot he was meant to serve as one of Labour’s agents of social change’ when he wrote his stories all those years ago. ‘This is rather emblematic of Labour and socialism,’ he said. ‘It can’t stop meddling with things that really shouldn’t concern it – even children’s stories.’ There are 1,000 women working as train drivers, which equates to just 4.2 per cent of the total number. Train drivers' union Aslef is currently working to encourage more women into the industry. Mother-of-two . Ms Creagh said that the Thomas The Tank Engine books and television . show were 'wonderful', but criticised the series for not having enough . female characters.

Ms Creagh said that the tales of the little blue steam engine should follow the example of CBeebies series Underground Ernie, which features a main character called Victoria. She also suggested that train companies could up the numbers of female drivers by advertising in womens' interest magazines, or offering more part-time posts. Hit Entertainment, which owns the rights to Thomas, said that more female characters were being developed to address a historical imbalance.

"Two centuries after handkerchiefs were dipped in the blood of the beheaded French king Louis XVI, scientists believe they have proved one such rag kept as a revolutionary souvenir contains his bloodstains. For years researchers have been trying to verify the claim that an ornately decorated calabash contained a blood sample of the king, who was guillotined in Paris on January 21, 1793. On that day Parisian Maximilien Bourdaloue joined the crowds as dipped a handkerchief into the blood left at the scene of the decapitation. Beheading: Louis XVI was killed in 1793, as depicted in this painting of him being led to the guillotine by Charles Benazech . Study: Blood found in the gourd, right, was compared to DNA of the mummified skull of Henri IV, left, which found a genetic link . He is then believed to have placed the fabric in the gourd, which has been in the hands of an Italian family for more than a century, and had it embellished. Two years ago, analysis of DNA taken from traces of blood found inside the gourd revealed a likely match for someone of Louis' description, including his blue eyes. But it was never able to be proved beyond doubt as at the time the team did not have DNA of any royal relation. But a team of experts from France and Spain, which has published its findings in the journal Forensic Science International, have conducted further research using genetic material from another gruesome artefact - a mummified head believed to belong to Louis' 16th century predecessor, Henri IV. Their research has uncovered a rare genetic signature shared by two men separated by seven generations, and managed to provide evidence for the authenticity of both sets of remains in the process. French forensic pathologist Philippe Charlier said: 'This study shows that (the owners of the remains) share a genetic heritage passed on through the paternal line. Proof: The research has proved the authenticity of the gruesome artefacts of both the blood sample of Louis XVI, left, and the mummified head of Henri IV, right . 'They have a direct link to one another through their fathers.' The revolution in which Louis and queen Marie-Antoinette lost their heads in public executions also saw mobs ransack the royal chapel at Saint-Denis, north of Paris, hauling ancient monarchs like Henri from their tombs and mutilating the remains which they tossed into pits. Research: The results of the study were published yesterday and presented during a press conference earlier in December . An individual was recorded to have rescued a severed head from the chaos. Long thought to belong to Henri, assassinated at the age of 57 by a Catholic fanatic in 1610, the head changed hands several times over the next two centuries, bought and sold at auction or kept in secretive private collections. Scientists in 2010 said they found proof that the head was indeed Henri's, citing physical features that matched 16th century portraits of the king, as well as radiocarbon dating, 3D scanning and X-rays. The 2010 study, however, found no DNA and its findings have been contested by some. With the new evidence, 'it is about 250 times more likely that the (owners of the) head and the blood are paternally related, than unrelated,' according to co-author Carles Lalueza Fox of the Institut de Biologia Evolutiva in Barcelona. He said it would be 'extremely surprising' if the remains did not belong to the two monarchs, when all the physical and forensic evidence was taken together. Mr Charlier said: 'One can say that there is absolutely no doubt anymore.' The DNA data obtained from Louis XVI could now be used to decipher the genetic code of France's last absolute monarch and his living relatives.","Research solves 220 year mystery of Louis XVI remains in calabash .

"As of March 1 about 4.2 million Americans had signed up for medical insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act, according to numbers released Tuesday by the Obama administration. But it remains unclear how many of those enrollees have put their money where their mouse is. Combined figures published by Obamacare marketplaces in California, Connecticut, Maryland, Nevada, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington indicate that just 79 per cent of signups in those states have come with checks attached. If those numbers were to hold up nationally, it would mean that about 1.1 million Obamacare enrollees have selected insurance plans without paying for them – bringing the actual total of Obamacare-insured Americans down to 3.3 million. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius continues to plug the Obamacare insurance coverage system despite enrollment numbers that have been less than expected . Desperate or smart? On Tuesday the White House defended its decision to send President Barack Obama out to do an interview with 'Funny or Die' mini-show host Zach Galifinakis, saying the satire website immediately became the number-one online referrer to healthcare.gov . The Newark Star-Ledger reported in late February that 'at least three-quarters' of plans sold by three insurers in New Jersey have been paid for. February . brought 943,000 new people into the Obamacare fold, bringing the . Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services 60 per cent of the way to the . Department of Health and Human Services' original goal of enrolling 7 . million Americans by the end of March. HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told reporters on a conference call Tuesday that the administration expects a March surge to close the gap. Last . month she backed off from the prediction of 7 million new insurance customers, . saying the new target was 6 million. The 4.2 million total is 70 per . cent of that lower benchmark number. The reconfiguration of the administration's goal came after a chronically ill beginning for Obamacare, marked by national confusion, website outages and an implementation cost that has exceeded two-thirds of 1 trillion dollars. About one-quarter of the enrollees since the program's October 1 launch have been adults in the 18-35 age range. Those desirable, mostly healthy people were originally expected to be one-third of the total, paying into the system to offset the staggering costs of treating older, sicker Americans. As the March 31 deadline ending the . open-enrollment season approaches, the White House has yet to release . any statistics showing how many people have paid the first month's . premium for their new insurance policies. Andale! Obama promoted his signature health insurance law in a town-hall event for Hispanic-Americans at the Newseum in Washington, D.C> on March 6 . Controversy: Restaurants like Gator's Dockside in Clermont, Florida have begun adding 1-percent Affordable Care Act surcharges to customers' checks in order to pay for the increasing cost of coverage under the new law . A Centers for Medicare and Medicaid . Services spokesman told MailOnline last month that the agency hasn't . 'prioritized' reporting its payment statistics, but plans to do so 'once . our automated payment systems are completed and fully tested.' CMS manages health insurance exchanges for 14 states and the District of Columbia. All together, the seven states where both . enrollment and payment numbers have been published have signed up 1.05 million . people, but reported that just 835,000 have paid premiums. More troubling for the Obama administration is a survey published last week by the consultancy McKinsey & Co., which found that only 27 per cent of new enrollees – or 1.14 million of the total announced Tuesday – were uninsured before they signed up. Millions of insured Americans received cancellation letters from their insurers in October, November and December, spurred by the companies' recognition that their existing offerings didn't satisfy the Affordable Care Act's stringent minimum standards. Mixed messages: A smaller percentage of Americans are uninsured than 6 months or a year ago, but the number has gone up overall during the Obama presidency . Those requirements include a host of coverage options – maternity coverage required for male customers, for instance – that critics say policyholders shouldn't have to pay for. McKinsey also found that just 1 in 10 Americans who are eligible for Obamacare policies have chosen to enroll. Adding insult to injury, a Gallup poll released Monday shows that while the percentage of uninsured Americans has dropped from 17.1 per cent at the end of 2013 to just 15.9 per cent now, that number stood at just 14.4 per cent before Obama took office. It's also not clear what will happen to taxpayers whose have not made payments by March 31. The Obama administration has asked some insurers to extend payment deadlines and provide enrollees with a grace period, but executives at two insurance companies have told MailOnline that they don't intend to do so.","As March 31 deadline approaches, the administration is nowhere near its original goal of 7 million signups – or its revised target of 6 million .

"Marijuana has been blamed for causing car accidents and fuelling acts of violence. But now controversial new research suggests that couples who smoke the drug together are actually less likely to be violent towards one another. And experts claim it's not just the effects of cannabis on the brain, but the fact that couples who use it may share similar values and social circles, that may reduce the likelihood of conflict. Scroll down for video . Controversial new research suggests that couples who smoke marijuana together are less likely to be violent towards one another - perhaps because of their views as well as the drug . Researchers at the University at Buffalo School of Public Health and Health Professions and Research Institute on Addictions, in New York, studied 634 couples to find that the more they smoked marijuana, the less likely they were to engage in domestic violence. Examining the couples over the first nine years of marriage, they discovered that husbands who used the drug around three times a week with their wives, were less likely to be violent towards them in the future. Marijuana use by husbands  predicted less frequent attacks from wives (illustrated with a stock image) according to the study . Marijuana use by husbands also predicted less frequent attacks from wives. The study, published in the journal Psychology of Addictive Behaviours, said that the relationship between marijuana use and reduced partner violence was most evident among women with no track record of antisocial behaviour. These findings suggest that marijuana use is predictive of lower levels of aggression towards one's partner in the following year,’ said Dr Kenneth Leonard, director of the university’s Research Institute on Addictions. He explained that as with other studies of this kind, the research examines patterns of marijuana use and the occurrence of violence within a year, and doesn't look at whether smoking pot on a given day leads to violence at that time. ‘It is possible, for example, that - similar to a drinking partnership - couples who use marijuana together may share similar values and social circles, and it is this similarity that is responsible for reducing the likelihood of conflict. ‘Although this study supports the perspective that marijuana does not increase, and may decrease, aggressive conflict, we would like to see research replicating these findings, and research examining day-to-day marijuana and alcohol use and the likelihood to intimate partner violence on the same day before drawing stronger conclusions.’ A study  last year found that rates of divorce in heavy drinking couples were the same as those who abstained . A study by the same university last year claimed that heavy drinking is bad for marriage if one spouse indulges - but not both. Researchers followed 634 couples from the time of their weddings through the first nine years of marriage. Over the course of the nine-year study, nearly half of couples where only one partner drank more heavily, wound up divorcing. The divorce rates for other couples were 30 per cent. If both spouses were heavy drinkers, the divorce rate was the same as for couples where neither were heavy drinkers. 'Our results indicate that it is the difference between the couple's drinking habits, rather than the drinking itself, that leads to marital dissatisfaction, separation and divorce,’ said Dr Kenneth Leonard. ‘This research provides solid evidence to bolster the commonplace notion that heavy drinking by one partner can lead to divorce.' Heavy drinking was defined as drinking six or more drinks at one time or drinking to intoxication. The researchers claimed that heavy drinking spouses may be more tolerant of negative experiences related to alcohol due to their own drinking habits. They cautioned, however, that this does not mean other aspects of family life remain unaffected. ‘While two heavy drinkers may not divorce, they may create a particularly bad climate for their children,’ Dr Leonard said.","Study by the University at Buffalo in New York studied 634 couples in their first nine years of marriage to study the link between the drug and violence .

"Rising living costs: Energy company SSE will increase tariffs, adding £8.53 to the monthly gas and electricity bills . Energy giant SSE will increase its tariffs by 9 per cent in a move that could trigger the other ‘big six’ firms to follow suit. More than eight million gas and electricity customers will be affected in a blow for cash-strapped families struggling with rising living costs and below-inflation pay rises. The move will add £8.53 a month to the typical monthly direct debit, dual-fuel bill – taking the average annual bill to £1,274. SSE, the UK’s second largest energy firm, will introduce the  increase on October 15. The firm says the move is in response to energy price increases in wholesale markets, as well as rising costs of using the National Grid network. British Gas parent company Centrica recently warned that wholesale price rises may lead to higher bills this autumn. And utility groups are facing increasing costs of regulation and government-sponsored schemes, which are being passed on to customers. Martin Lewis of MoneySavingExpert.com warned of further energy-price misery to come. He said: ‘When one moves, others follow, and over the next three months I’d expect to see similar announcements.’ He urged customers to consider switching to better deals and  said there were some good fixed-rate deals on the market. SSE said it will cap prices following  the price rise until at least the  second half of 2013. Chief executive Ian Marchant said: ‘Unfortunately, the increases in costs that we have seen since making this pledge can no longer be absorbed and mean that we are unable to keep prices at their current levels beyond this autumn. More misery to come: Money expert Martin Lewis warned that other energy companies are likely to follow SSE's lead, making similar announcements in the next three months . ‘An increase in our prices has therefore, regrettably, become unavoidable.’ SSE, which trades as Southern Electric, Swalec and Scottish Hydro, said it had seen a 14 per cent increase in the average price in the wholesale market to secure gas for the coming winter. The group also announced changes to simplify bills by introducing a new fixed standard charge of £100 per year for fuel and a single unit rate for energy used. Richard Lloyd, executive director of Which?, called on the Government to reform the market ahead of the expected raft of price rises. He said: ‘We can’t go through another winter with people worrying about their energy bills. Unavoidable: From left, SSE chief executive Ian Marchant said the rate rises were 'regrettably unavoidable', while Richard Lloyd from Which? wants the energy market to be reformed . ‘The Government and the regulator . must reform our broken energy market. It’s time for energy prices to be . properly transparent and tariffs to be made simpler, so that consumers . get a fair deal.’ Consumer Focus said that, following . the October price rise, SSE will be by far the most expensive of the big . six providers for the typical dual fuel tariff. SSE’s price rise comes after it reduced gas prices by 4.5 per cent in March. Last September, it increased gas prices by 18 per cent and electricity tariffs by 11 per cent. SSE’s recent results showed its . domestic supply operation made £271.7million last year, although this . was 21 per cent lower than a year earlier.","Energy company SSE will increase its rates by 9 per cent .

"An openly gay former Dominican friar insisted today that homosexuality is the ‘ticking time bomb in the Catholic Church’ and that homosexual men are ‘massively over-represented’ within the Church. Mark Dowd, who is now a journalist, said research for his 2001 Channel 4 documentary Queer and Catholic suggested that at least half of people attracted into seminaries in the priesthood are gay. His comments came as the former leader of Roman Catholics in England and Wales, Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O’Connor, said the scandal-hit Catholic Church must undergo renewal and reform. Scroll down for video . Former friar: Mark Dowd, who is now a journalist, said research for his 2001 Channel 4 documentary Queer and Catholic had suggested at least half of people attracted into seminaries in the priesthood are gay . Mr Dowd told CNN: ‘When you have this culture of secrecy and guilt and repression, you have conditions which foster the potential for blackmail and for manipulation. ‘This is a very unhealthy stage for the church, because basically when you have secrecy, you have lies - and when you have lies, people often are put in terrible pressures of being compromised.’ Meanwhile, the Cardinal said the successor to Benedict XVI would need to be able to tackle reform of the Roman Curia, the Vatican departments which govern the 1.2billion-strong global church. Last weekend Italian newspapers published claims of homosexuality and blackmail within the Church, with one allegation centering around a secret ‘gay cabal’ of priests, reported CNN. But veteran Vatican journalist Marco Politi said this idea was ‘rubbish’, adding: ‘Here in the Vatican, there are monsignors who have love affairs, with women and with men. But they hide it.’ Mr Dowd added: ‘I've got my own experience of being in religious life myself. And I can tell you that gay men are massively, massively overrepresented in Catholic life. There's nothing wrong with that. Vatican: Italian media ran a series of stories last week about the alleged contents of a secret report prepared for the Pope by a commission of three cardinals who investigated the Vatileaks scandal last year . ‘The problem is that a lot of them are told that they are intrinsically unhealthy according to church teaching. And that's not a very appropriate state of affairs if we're talking about psychosexual health and emotional maturity.’ 'I've got my own experience of being in religious life myself. And I can tell you that gay men are massively, massively overrepresented in Catholic life' Mark Dowd, former Dominican friar . Earlier this week Britain’s most senior Roman Catholic, Cardinal Keith O’Brien, apologised for his failures after being ordered to quit by the Pope as a further sex scandal swept the church. Italian media ran stories last week about the alleged contents of a secret report prepared for the Pope by a commission of three cardinals who investigated the Vatileaks scandal last year. Paolo Gabriele, the pope's butler, was convicted of stealing personal papal documents and leaking them to the media. He was jailed and later pardoned by the pope. The documents alleged corruption in the Vatican and infighting over the running of its bank, which has been at the heart of a series of scandals in past decades. But the Vatican said the Italian media had spread 'false and damaging' reports and claimed it was an attempt to influence cardinals who will meet in a secret conclave next month to elect a new pope.","Mark Dowd says gay men are 'massively over-represented' within Church .

"Leader: Abubakar Shekau, head of Boko Haram, speaks in a video released by the Islamist group . More than 200 schoolgirls kidnapped by Boko Haram have been married off to militants, according to a man claiming to be the leader of the Islamic extremists. The man, who identifies himself as Abubakar Shekau, said the 219 girls, who were taken from  the remote northeastern town of Chibok in April, are now 'in their marital homes'. He added that they have all converted to Islam and have now memorised two chapters of the Koran. He said: 'We have married them off. They are in their marital homes. Don't you know the over 200 Chibok schoolgirls have converted to Islam?' The claims, which were published in a video seen today, contradict recent claims by the Nigerian government that the girls would soon be freed. They call into question whether talks between a Boko Haram faction and the government in neighbouring Chad will secure the girls' release. The man claiming to be Shekau, who the Nigerian military says it killed a year ago, also denied there was a ceasefire. Violence has continued since the government announced the agreement, raising doubts about how much influence Danladi Ahmadu, the man with whom the govenment is negotiating, has over the group. Shekau also announced that Boko Haram, which means 'Western education is sinful', was holding a German hostage after kidnapping him from the northeastern city of Gombe in July. Armed militants, understood to be linked to Boko Haram, kidnapped the teacher from a technical college. Boko Haram has killed thousands of people since launching its campaign for an Islamic state five years ago. The terror group has attacked targets almost every day for weeks. Last week it seized control of Mubi, the home town of Nigeria's defence chief Alex Badeh. It was Badeh who announced the ceasefire. Kidnapped: The 219 schoolgirls, pictured here in a video released by Boko Haram shortly after their abduction, have been 'married off' to jihadists, according to the terror group.

"The US has declared that it will not allow mobile phones - especially iPhones and Samsung's Galaxy - onto US bound planes from some airports in Europe, the Middle East and Africa if the devices are not charged. The new measure, which is bound to cause chaotic scenes at airports around the globe, is part of the US Transportation Security Administration's effort to boost surveillance amid concerns that terrorists are plotting to blow up an airliner. As part of the increased scrutiny at certain airports, security agents may ask travelers to turn on their electronic devices at checkpoints and if they do not have power, the devices will not be allowed on planes, the TSA said. Scroll down for video . Increased vigilance: US intelligence officials are concerned that al-Qaida is trying to develop a new and improved bomb that could go undetected through airport security . No doubt the new measures have the potential to create frantic searches for chargers at airports and one US source familiar with the matter said laptop computers are also among the devices security screeners may also require passengers to turn on. US officials are concerned that a cellphone, tablet, laptop or other electronic device could be used as a bomb by Yemen-based al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and the Islamist Nusra Front, al Qaeda's affiliate in Syria. In 2009 a Yemen-linked bomb-maker, Ibrahim al-Asiri, built an underwear bomb used in the failed effort to bring down a Detroit-bound airliner, and his devices were implicated in other plots. The Islamist Nusra Front, Al Qaeda’s affiliate involved in fighting with Syrian rebels to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad, is also thought to be plotting an airliner attack, according to intelligence reports. The TSA did not disclose which airports would be conducting the additional screening, however it was reported last week that passengers at British airports traveling to the US are facing extra checks on phones. An official told the BBC that London's Heathrow was among the airports. US officials singled out smartphones including iPhones made by Apple Inc and Galaxy phones made by Samsung Electronics Co Ltd for extra security checks on U.S.-bound direct flights from Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Special attention: The TSA in the US has announced that iPhones and Samsung Galaxy phones will come under strict scrutiny . US . security officials said they fear bombmakers from the Yemen-based al . Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) have figured out how to turn the . phones into explosive devices that can avoid detection. They also are concerned that hard-to-detect bombs could be built into shoes, said the officials, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue. A US official said that other electronic devices carried by passengers also are likely to receive more intense scrutiny and travellers may be asked to power up laptops, iPads, tablets and Kindles. A TSA statement said: ‘As the travelling public knows, all electronic devices are screened by security officers. ‘During the security examination, officers may also ask that owners power up some devices, including cell phones. ‘Powerless devices will not be permitted onboard the aircraft. The traveller may also undergo additional screening.’ Airlines or airport operators that fail to strengthen security could face bans on flights entering the United States, the officials said. The US Homeland Security Department announced on Wednesday plans to step up security checks, but they offered few details on how airlines and airports will implement them. Strict: The Transportation Security Administration will not allow cellphones or other electronic devices on US-bound planes from now on . US Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said at the time: ‘We will work to ensure these necessary steps pose as few disruptions to travellers  as possible.’ An official familiar with the matter said the United States believes that while it is possible there may be some additional delays at security checkpoints, at most major airports passengers will not be seriously inconvenienced. The official said most passengers taking long-distance flights arrive well in advance of scheduled departures, leaving time for extra screening. But he said the United States could not rule out disruptions in countries where airport infrastructure and security procedures are less sophisticated. In his weekly radio phone-in programme, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg warned last week that travellers may have to get used to the extra checks. ‘I don’t think we should expect this to be a one-off temporary thing,’ he said. ‘We have to make sure the checks are there to meet the nature of the new kinds of threats.’ ‘Whether it is for ever – I can’t make any predictions. But I don’t want people to think that this is just a sort of a blip for a week. This is part of an evolving and constant review about whether the checks keep up with the nature of the threats.’ US-based airlines had little to say about the enhanced security. American Airlines spokesman Matt Miller said the Department of Homeland Security had been in contact with American on the issue, but declined to comment further. On guard: Western nations have stepped up security at airports after US officials said they were concerned that al Qaeda operatives in Syria and Yemen were developing bombs that could be smuggled onto planes . Luke Punzenberger, a spokesman for United Airlines said: 'We work closely with federal officials on security matters, but we are not able to discuss the details of those efforts.' US security agencies fear bombmakers from AQAP and the Islamist Nusra Front, al Qaeda's affiliate in Syria, are collaborating on plots to attack U.S.- or Europe-bound planes with bombs concealed on foreign fighters carrying Western passports, the officials said. AQAP has a track record of plotting such attacks. Its innovative bombmaker, Ibrahim al-Asiri, built an underwear bomb used in a failed 2009 effort to bring down a Detroit-bound airliner, and his devices were implicated in other plots. There was no immediate indication U.S. intelligence had detected a specific plot or timeframe for any attack. US officials say the United States has acquired evidence that Nusra and AQAP operatives have tested new bomb designs in Syria, where Nusra is one of the main Islamist groups fighting to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad.","The new directive by the TSA affects flights out of Africa, the Middle East and Europe .

"Instagram is so awash with photos of food, the craze has even coined the term ‘food-ography’. And now a pop-up diner in London is taking advantage of this trend by letting people settle the bill for their meals simply by uploading photos of it to social networks.

The world's first pay-by-picture restaurant opens to the public in London tomorrow. Each diner will be served a two-course meal and if they upload photos of the food, pictured, to Instagram, Twitter or Facebook, using the #BirdsEyeInspirations hashtag, they won't have to pay . Scientists claim taking a photo of your food before you eat it makes it taste better. Researchers from Minnesota claim photographing food puts people in the moment and in doing so, heightens their senses. The person taking the photo will, on some level, feel the difference creating an incentive to continue the practice. The data also revealed that a longer delay between ritual and consumption bolstered these effects. These findings contradict a study from researchers in Utah that found looking at too many pictures of food can make it less enjoyable to eat. This is because looking at pictures of what is on a plate can make people bored with their meal before they've even taken a bite. The Picture House has been opened to mark the launch of a new range of meals from Birds Eye. Each diner will be served a two-course meal, and if they upload photos of the food to Instagram, Twitter or Facebook using the #BirdsEyeInspirations hashtag, they won’t have to pay. Diners at the pop-up restaurant at the Ice Tank in Soho will also be given tutorials from food photographer Marie Marte. The opening follows research by Birds Eye that found over half of people (52 per cent) regularly take photos of their meals.

"Savaged: Houston woman Maria Arcos is fighting for her life . A woman is fighting for her life after suffering a heart attack brought on by a horrific dog attack that has left her with severe wounds from head to toe. Maria Arcos  was set upon by a pack of at least 15 dogs while she was on her way to start a new job on Monday morning. The 52-year-old, from Houston, was passing through an underpass when she was surrounded by the pack of strays, the ring leader of which is believed to be a pit bull cross. The wild animals savaged her, pulling her to the ground and biting her arms and legs. Arcos was left with severe wounds and is now in hospital in a critical condition. Her family fear the attack left her so badly injured she might not pull through. Her stepson Oscar Reyes said: 'They were eating her - the dogs was eating her to the bone. 'They bit her arms, her legs, her neck. They cover her. 'Supposedly in 48 hours, if she doesn’t get better, she’s not going to make it.' During the frenzied attack, Oscar claims his stepmother's clothes were ripped off and she now has severe wounds covering most of her body. Although she was still conscious when officers arrived, the stress of the mauling caused her to have a heart attack. Her family are keeping a constant vigil by her hospital bed. Oscar added: 'They already have a lot of problems and then this happens. It shocks kind of everybody.' Sustained attack: He may be only a puppy, but he and the rest of the pack savaged a housekeeper on her way to work . Vigil: Stepson Oscar Reyes says they are keeping a constant vigil at his stepmother's hospital bedside. Right, officers have baited a trap with food to catch the strays . Police officers came to the house to break the shocking news and Oscar has been tasked with letting the rest of his family know, some of whom have not been at home. Arcos' horrifying ordeal occurred at about 6am on Monday near Lyons and Eastex Freeway in the Fifth Ward. She had been walking to a nearby bus stop on her way to start a new job as a housekeeper, but only made it halfway there. She was walking through an underpass when a pack of mixed-breed strays, said to number at least 15, set about her and pulled her to the ground. She was only saved when a railroad worker witnessed her being savaged and called for help. Deadly: Maria Arcos was walking through this underpass on her way to the bus stop when she was set upon . Vital clue: Officers were able to trace the dogs to their den underneath a mortuary using these foot prints . City of Houston animal control manager Chris Glaser said: 'Most of the time you won’t have them . acting out in an aggressive manner like this. 'Usually you’ll have one or . two, but an attack like this is very rare. 'It’s a pack mentality. That can happen when there’s an aggressive act by one and it continues. 'With that many dogs on her, she was being dragged up and down the street.' Animal control officers traced the pack responsible to their den underneath a nearby mortuary. They trapped the dogs in and have been trying to lure them into a single trap using food as bait. So far they have captured five of the animals from underneath the mortuary, two of which are puppies and only about four months old. Glaser said one of the dogs, a pit bull mix, appears to be the leader of the pack. He believes at least ten dogs are still hiding out underneath the mortuary. Officers are visiting up to five times a day to check on the trap. Glaser told KHOU 11 News all of the dogs would be tested for rabies and possibly destroyed.","'They were eating her - the dogs were eating her to the bone'

"Outrageous: James Tracy claims that the government was behind the Boston Marathon bomber that left 3 dead and more than 180 injured . Outrageous claims made by a professor who specializes in conspiracy theories are set to provoke grieving families by saying that the Sandy Hook massacre may not have happened at all. James Tracy, a tenured history professor at Florida Atlantic University, wrote a lengthy post on his personal blog saying that the shooting that left 20 children and six teachers dead may not have happened the way that it is widely believed, if it happened at all. Backed solely by the erroneous early reports filed during the midst of the horrendous incident, Mr Tracy 's claim is preying on the confusion of the tragic day. 'While it sounds like an outrageous claim, one is left to inquire whether the Sandy Hook shooting ever took place -- at least in the way law enforcement authorities and the nation's news media have described,' he has said. The 47-year-old professor bases his . outrageous claims largely on the flurry of conflicting media reports . that were made as news of the shooting was released throughout the day . on December 14. As . with many conspiracy theorists who find darker linings in even the most . horrific tragedies, this is far from his first foray into the world of . the unproven. Mr Tracy has written a number of book chapters about media coverage of wars, economic overhauls and union negotiations. On . his blog, however, he has hit a number of the classic conspiracy . theories: the September 11 attacks, the purview of the Department of . Homeland Security, the PATRIOT Act, the death of Osama bin Laden and . Fukishima have all been topics of interest. Shut down: Sandy Hook Elementary School is now closed, seen here on January 3, but a professor in Florida argues that the shooting that took place in the school may not have happened as is conventionally believed . Tragic: One of the points of professor James Tracy's argument is the fact that there have been no photos of the bodies of the 20 child victims or the six teachers . In his latest shocking claim, he focuses much of his attention on the fact that early reports claimed that police were either searching for or had two suspects in custody. The story then progressed that Ryan Lanza was the lone gunman, based reportedly on the identification that the shooter had on him at the time of the attack. Ryan, 24, was then found at his home in Hoboken, New Jersey - two states away from his 20-year-old brother Adam, the shooter. Even though he is paid to teach a class called Culture of Conspiracy which will undoubtedly produce outrageous ideas, Florida Atlantic University appears to feel that the questioning of the murder of first graders was a bridge too far. 'James Tracy does not speak for the . university. The website on which his post appeared is not affiliated . with FAU in any way,' school spokesman Lisa Metcalf said to the Sun Sentinel. Though his ultimate end goal is unclear, he says that the end goal of the 'supposed' shooting was political in nature. The moment he heard: Mr Tracy believes that there were government forces at work in the shooting at Sandy Hook, and theoretically then this may not be the moment President Obama was told . Predictably, his statements have . sparked outrage from people across the country and not just in the . still-grieving Connecticut town where much of the last three weeks has . been spent picking up the pieces. 'Is there something in the water in . Florida that makes for idiocy,' commented Ray Gillies on the story by . the local ABC affiliate WPBF. 'How dare you suggest this was a hoax . and entertain that this didn't happen,' said a Sun Sentinel reader with . the username JimNasium1. 'I'm afraid that you do not seem to be . worthy of the teaching credentials that you hold and were any of my . kids students of yours, I'd withdraw them from your roster within the . hour.You are NOT good at what you do and you suck as a human being.' Political ends: He argues that the shooting was enabled in order to speed up legislation against guns . Instead, he is speaking plenty for himself and other believers by posting repeatedly on his blog, memoryholeblog.com, and appearing on talk radio shows to promote the theory. 'As documents relating to the Sandy Hook shooting continue to be assessed and interpreted by independent researchers, there is a growing awareness that the media coverage of the massacre of 26 children and adults was intended primarily for public consumption to further larger political ends,' he wrote. He argues that Senator Dianne Feinstein was already in the midst of trying to rework the assault weapons ban that she co-sponsored back in the 1990s, and that the shooting gave her leverage to move it through the legislative process quicker. It is unclear if Mr Tracy has any vested interest in the gun control debate or if he himself owns any guns. Calls to Mr Tracy were not immediately returned.","Professor James Tracy asserts the shooting may have happened differently, if at all .

"Retiring: Bob Hoskins was given the diagnosis in the autumn. Announcing his retirement the star's agent said he planned to spent time with his family . Actor Bob Hoskins is retiring from showbusiness after being diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease. The announcement brings to an end a silver screen career which spanned four decades and included Hollywood hits such as Who Framed Roger Rabbit. His most recent appearance was in Snow White and the Huntsman, released this year and starring Kristen Stewart. Hoskins, 69, revealed his battle with the brain disorder yesterday, several months after his diagnosis. A statement released by his agent said: 'Bob Hoskins wishes to announce that he will be retiring from acting, following his diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease last autumn. 'He wishes to thank all the great and brilliant people he has worked with over the years, and all of his fans who have supported him during a wonderful career. 'Bob is now looking forward to his  retirement with his family, and would greatly appreciate that his privacy be respected at this time' Symptoms of Parkinson’s include tremors, muscle stiffness, difficulty with movement and a gradual slowing down of the body. Facial expression and balance can also be affected. Daiga Heisters, of support and research charity Parkinson’s UK, said: 'We are sorry to learn that Bob Hoskins has been diagnosed with Parkinson’s. Parkinson’s is a progressive condition that affects everybody differently, and can change on a daily, or even hourly, basis. 'Many people can live a full and active life with their diagnosis of Parkinson’s. However, it does affect some people quickly and severely.' Hoskins is perhaps best known for his role in 1988 Hollywood hit Who Framed Roger Rabbit? Actor Michael J Fox is one of the most . well-known sufferers of the disease, which he has battled for more than . 20 years. He was diagnosed at the age of 30, but did not make the news . public for another seven years.

"Scottish mathematicians believe that 'self replicating' robotic space probes sent by alien civilisations could already be in our solar system. The University of Edinburgh study warns that the probes are probably so hi-tech they appear invisible to us as we don't have technology advanced enough to detect them. While our Voyager probe has just reached the edge of our solar system, older and more technologically advanced civilisations could have launched similar probes years before us that are already here. Mathematicians believe robotic space probes, perhaps slightly similar to Nasa's Van Allen (pictured) have been sent by alien civilisations and could be in our solar system . Mathematicians Duncan . Forgan and Arwen Nicholson believe that alien races could have sent . probes that 'slingshot' round stars using their gravity to cover ground . quickly, Yahoo! News reported. The researchers analysed how a 'fleet' of probes could travel through space in a paper published in the International Journal of Astrobiology. They said probes that 'self . replicate' and build new versions of themselves from dust and gas while . traveling through space, could be in our solar system already. Dr Forgan thinks that as we have not seen any of these probes could mean that we are alone in our galaxy. Our Voyager probe (pictured) has just reached the edge of our solar system, but older, more technologically advanced  civilisations could have launched similar probes years before us that are already here . He said: 'The fact we haven't seen probes of this type makes it difficult to believe that probe building civilisations have existed in the Milky Way in the last few million years.' The mathematicians calculated that alien probes would only need to travel at 10 per cent of the speed of light in order to explore every part of our galaxy within 10 million years. They think that the probes can use . 'slingshot manoeuvres' around stars to increase their velocity by using . energy from the star's motion around the galactic centre. Scientists think that alien probes can use 'slingshot manoeuvres' around stars (pictured) to increase their velocity by using energy from the star's motion around the galactic centre . The study re frames the question posed in the 'Fermi Paradox' about the search for alien life . In 1953 physicist Enrico Fermi asked 'where is everybody?' The mathematicians 'prove' that alien probes could technically be close by in our solar system . Jacob . Haqq-Misra of the Rock Ethics Institute write that alien artifacts could already exist in our solar system but we haven;t looked hard enough for them . Nasa expert Robert Freitas thinks that they have been designed to appear invisible to us - so we can't prove they are nearby . Dr Forgan thinks the probes will make contact when we have passed their intelligence test - perhaps by sensing their presence . Our Voyager probe uses a similar technique on planets in the solar system, but utilising the larger gravity of a star would lead to a much bigger speed boost. The mathematicians used computing power to inform their predictions, which might not sound out of place in a sci-fi novel. Their work shows that it is mathematically possible for alien probes to be close by, but does not explain why they have not been in touch. The scientists said: 'We can conclude that a fleet of . self-replicating probes can indeed explore the Galaxy in a sufficiently . short time...orders of magnitude less than the age of the Earth.' They muse that the alien probes would have been programmed not to all arrive at the same time, or their presence could look like a hostile attack and cause panic on Earth. In a paper from 2011, Jacob . Haqq-Misra of the Rock Ethics Institute wrote that alien artifacts . might already exist in our solar system without us knowing, simply . because we haven't looked for them hard enough. Our Voyager probe (pictured) 'slingshots' around planets. Taking account of such techniques to gain a speed boost, the mathematicians' theory shows it is technically possible for alien probes to be in our solar system . The Scottish mathematicians draw on Nasa space expert, Robert Freitas's idea from 1983 that supposes that alien probes have been designed to appear invisible to us. Dr Forgan believes a probe's camouflage could be set up to test the intelligence of our civilisation . Only when a test is met, such as a species being able to detect a probe, would it attempt to communicate. He notes that evidence of broken probes is unlikely as any aliens attempting large-scale exploration of the universe would be skilled engineers. He thinks that such civilisations would send probes that can self-replicate over the incredibly long distances traveled.","Researchers from Edinburgh University analysed how a 'fleet' of probes could travel through space .

"A donkey born in a First World War trench who saved countless soldiers' lives on the battlefield is being honoured for his bravery almost 100 years on. Jimmy 'The Sergeant' was born in France after a shell wounded his pregnant mother as she went into labour during the Battle of the Somme in 1916. Troops brought the donkey up amid falling shells and gunfire on the frontline and weaned him on tins of condensed milk. War donkey: Jimmy in the 1920s with one of his keepers after he was 'demobbed'. he was born at the Somme in 1916 and saved countless soldiers' lives . Jimmy spent the next two years in the Army, . carrying equipment and soldiers, and he was even taught to raise his hoof in . salute, with the troop of Cameronian Scottish Rifles. Jimmy has now been awarded the Dickin Medal for bravery, the highest military honour for an animal, by the Cameronian's Museum in Hamilton, Scotland. Sam Morrell, Cameronian Scottish Rifles Regimental Association member and war historian, said: 'Jimmy played an important role in keeping up the morale of the troops, even if he just acted as a distraction from the horror of what was around them. 'He gave them something else to think about rather than whether or not they would be killed. 'He was a clever animal and even was even trained to raise his hoof in salute on command. 'After the war he gave a lot of pleasure to children and helped raised a lot of money for charity. It's only right that he should be honoured and I'm glad he is recognised by the Hamilton museum.' Despite being lauded for his role on the frontline, mystery surrounds the circumstances of Jimmy's birth. Troops: The Cameronian Scottish Rifles 'somewhere in France' during World War I. They looked after Jimmy on the frontline - but he was wounded three times by shells in the space of two years . Troops: The Cameronian Scottish Riffles somewhere in Malta during the First World War. After the end of the conflict they were based temporarily in Peterborough - and while there Jimmy was sold . It has been claimed he was delivered by Scottish troops following an agreed cease fire between Allied and enemy soldiers. With tank technology still in its infancy, donkeys and horses were still an essential tool in every country's armoury during World War I. However, as machine guns were developed throughout the conflict, they became less and less useful. The British mounted cavalry charges throughout the war. However, the key role of the horse - and the donkey - was as a method of transport to take weapons and supplies to the frontline. The motor car was still in the early stages of its development - and was certainly not versatile enough to cross the muddy terrain in France and Belgium. Although railways could have been built, the process was time-consuming and it was easiest to transport things by donkey or horse. Another account says Jimmy's mother was sent into labour after being hit by a shell and the baby donkey was born soon afterwards, only to be found by advancing Scottish troops in no man's land cowering next to her body. The young donkey was wounded three times by shellfire during his two years on the frontline. At the end of the war he was de-mobbed and in 1920 brought to Peterborough, where the Cameronian Scottish Rifles were briefly based before returning to Scotland. But before the soldiers left, Jimmy was sold at a charity auction to a woman known only as Mrs Heath from Peterborough, Cambridgeshire. Throughout the next 23 years Jimmy was used in a series of charity events raising thousands of pounds for the RSPCA, including donkey rides for children along the city's beach. After his death, he was buried in Peterborough's Central Park in 1943 and a monument erected. The grave fell into disrepair but it was restored in 2003. Sam said: 'There were many boys from this area who were in the Cameronians and were killed during World War One. 'Jimmy received the Dicken Medal and he was made an honorary sergeant with three stripes on his bridle. 'Jimmy was injured three times by shell debris but he recovered each time. He is a big part of the Cameronian history and we want to make sure that he is never forgotten.' Jimmy will be honoured as part of an exhibition at the Cameronian's Museum in Hamilton, which will reopen on April 4 following a refurbishment.","Jimmy 'The Sergeant' was born at the Battle of the Somme in 1916 .

"A mother has shamed her cyber-bullying daughter online by making her pose with a poster saying she is selling her iPod as punishment. The image posted online shows the North Carolina teenager, Hailey, holding up a handwritten sign explaining that she is selling the gadget to raise money for an anti-bullying charity. Hailey's mother posted it to Facebook, where it was seen by another user and shared on Reddit. 'I . make poor choices with social media,' the sign reads. 'As punishment, I am selling my . iPod and will be donating the money to the Charity Beat Bullying... Because bullying is wrong.' After the image was shared on reddit last week, numerous commenters accused Hailey's mother, Cara Schneider, of using her own bullying tactics against her daughter. Shamed: A mother snapped this picture of her teenage daughter after she allegedly caught her bullying online. The photo has since gone viral, but some commenters have accused the mother of being the bully . 'Humiliating your child to teach her not to humiliate other children? Gee, I wonder where she gets it!' one wrote. 'This is terrible parenting,' another added. 'It's things like this that make kids hate their parents. This will only make her behave worse out of spite.' But Schneider has defended her actions and said she does not regret posting the photograph as she wants her daughter to act appropriately towards others, the Examiner reported. She explained that the photo was just the latest way to discipline her daughter following a long line of other methods, including grounding her and making her carry out manual labor. She added that the photograph was posted on a Facebook page for a local yard yard sale so that the iPod could be sold, and that she had no intention of other people posting it elsewhere; she had shared it on Facebook before another user posted it to the reddit page without her knowledge. No regrets: The girl's mother, Cara Schneider, right, said she does not regret posting the picture on a Facebook group for a yard sale because she wants her daughter to act appropriately towards others . 'I'm not worried about the negative that has been said about her punishment,' she wrote on her Facebook page. 'I am her mother and I did what I thought was best given the circumstances. I've tried other punishments, and this fit the crime. I don't regret a thing.' Other reddit users supported her parenting choices. 'This makes me happy, because so often people only get caught after it's far too late to help the victims,' one wrote. 'Brava, mom. Brava.' She's not the first parent to shame their teenager publicly. Last year, a dad made his 15-year-old daughter wear a t-shirt showing his face and the message 'Try Me!!' to school after she disobeyed him over curfews.","North Carolina mother snapped an image of her teenage daughter holding up a sign reading: 'I make poor choices with social media'

"Swooping in over a packed beach sometimes just 10 metres above the heads of holidaymakers, it's easy to see why Princess Juliana Airport on the Caribbean island of St Maarten is one of the least loved destinations for pilots. Despite being the second-busiest airport in the Eastern Caribbean the runway at Princess Juliana is just 7,152 feet - less than half the length of many international airports. However with the island being such a popular tourist destination, the airport regularly sees landings of some of the largest passenger jets including the mighty Boeing 747-400. To make things even more tricky for pilots, a large bank of hills at one end of the runway means aircraft must circle round and come in to land from the sea which takes them over Maho Beach just a stone's throw from the runway and often packed with throngs of holidaymakers.

"'Grim day': Rt Rev Justin Welby, the incoming Archbishop of Canterbury is under pressure to make changes . The heads of the Church of England are under pressure to seek help from outside mediators as anger grows over the vote against women bishops. Justin Welby, the next Archbishop of . Canterbury, also faces calls from senior bishops to resolve the issue as . soon as possible rather than wait. The Archbishops' Council is due to meet next week to discuss the gaping chasm that has opened within the Church after Tuesday's controversial decision. Sources within the council are urging the use of professional mediators after an angry response from female clergy to the 'slap in the face' from the Synod. Church leaders have warned a fresh vote . on the issue may not be possible before 2015, with any changes not being made until 2020, but Government sources have . made it clear they wanted to see action much more quickly. Bishop Welby, who had a career in business before being ordained, is likely to acquiesce after warnings that the row could lead to the disestablishment of the Church, according to The Times. David Cameron yesterday warned the Church of England to think again about its ‘very sad’ rejection of women bishops, as MPs called for Parliament to intervene directly. In a strongly worded rebuke, the Prime Minister said it was time for the Church to ‘get with the programme’ or risk looking dangerously out of touch with modern society. He said: ‘I’m very clear, the time is right for women bishops, it was right many years ago, they need to get on with it as it were and get with the programme, but you do have to respect the individual institutions and the way they work, while giving them a sharp prod.’ Scroll down for video . Disappointment: Women embrace at a vigil outside Church House following the announcement of the rejection . Former Labour culture secretary Ben Bradshaw said: ‘If the Synod can’t sort it out, we need to help them. We cannot allow this to drag on for another ten years. 'It’s simply not sustainable, it’s not tolerable to the vast majority of Anglicans in this country and the vast majority of the English public who support women bishops and simply cannot understand how this is allowed to happen.’ Labour’s Frank Field was one of at least two MPs yesterday proposing legislation that would remove the Church’s exemption from equality law, meaning it could be sued for discrimination against women. Yesterday both Dr Rowan Williams, the current Archbishop of Canterbury, and the Right Reverend Justin Welby, who will assume the post at the end of year, admitted that the rejection of women bishops had left the Church out of step with society. Downbeat: Dr Williams, pictured last month showing his disappointment after the General Synod vote against allowing women bishops, said the decision had damaged the Church . Rejection: A general view of the Assembly Hall of Church House, where a vote rejected legislation introducing the first women bishops . Dr Welby said it was a ‘very grim day’, while Dr Williams said the Church had been ‘wilfully blind’ to the priorities of most people. The two prelates summed up the impact of the narrow defeat of just six votes. Even some among the 74 who voted against women bishops called for a peace and reconciliation process to try to reach agreement. Philip Giddings, chairman of the House of Laity, said: 'We need to take as long as it takes.' 'Very sad': David Cameron warned that the rejection of women bishops could make the Church look out of touch with modern society . As well as the threatening response from politicians, bishops expect the Church to suffer a major loss of face with the public. A source close to Culture Secretary Maria Miller, who is also minister for women and equality, said: ‘Whilst this is a matter for the Church, it’s very disappointing. As we seek to help women fulfil their potential throughout society this ruling would suggest the Church is at the very least behind the times.’ Labour frontbencher Chris Bryant, a former vicar, said the Government should consider ending the Church’s exemption from equality laws. He also called for a ban on the appointment of new bishops until the issue was resolved. He went on: ‘Maybe we should be introducing our own parliamentary Bill to allow for women bishops that is just straightforward and clear – it would still have to go to Synod but we could maybe start the process.’ Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said the Church of England needed to clarify its position on women bishops or risk becoming ‘marginalised’. Mr Hammond warned the Church was ‘in crisis’, adding: ‘It’s not just on the ordination of women, but a series of big divisive issues which the Church has to resolve, it has to heal, it has to find a way forward.’ The Church’s parliament, the General Synod, blocked the promotion of women by a tiny margin on Tuesday. Under its rules, there can be no reconsideration until a new Synod has been elected, which will not happen until 2015 – although there is an emergency process that could bring it forward.","Senior bishops want to bring in professionals to sort out the chaos .

Ms Kercher, from Coulsdon in Surrey, was found dead with her throat slashed in the bedroom of her home she shared with Knox in Perugia, Italy, on November 2, 2007. Knox returned to her home in Seattle in 2011 after the couple were acquitted, but a court upheld the guilty verdict last January, sentencing the former lovers to more than 25 years each in prison. Knox, who landed a job in her hometown in November last year as a freelance writer, has refused to return to Italy claiming the trial was unfair. The writer, who released a prison memoir in 2013 for which she was paid a reported £2.6million, initially used a pseudonym for her work at the West Seattle Herald, but has used her own name in recent weeks.","Amanda Knox was pictured strolling through streets of Seattle at weekend .

"While those watching The Hobbit might have felt they got their money’s worth when it came down to the film’s three-hour length, cinemas showing the blockbuster were left feeling a little hard done by. Now U.S. cinema owners have commissioned a report into losses suffered when screening a longer film four times a day rather than on six occasions, which is standard for a normal 90-minute film. The National Association of Theatre Owners is concerned that audiences are growing tired of the ‘film bloat’ of Hollywood directors, who could comfortable reduce the length of their longest films. Long haul: Martin Freeman plays Bilbo Baggins in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, which is 174 minutes . Alfred Hitchcock - director of Psycho, Vertigo and Rear Window, who died in 1980 - famously once said: ‘The length of a film should be directly related to the endurance of the human bladder.’ But his comments came in the 1950s, when films averaged 114 minutes - in contrast to Peter Jackson’s The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, which is 174 minutes, reported the Sunday Times. Cloud Atlas - a new drama based on a novel by David Mitchell starring Tom Hanks and Halle Berry, is just three minutes shorter than that, and many other Oscar contenders are more than 150 minutes. Long epic: Cloud Atlas - a new drama based on a novel by David Mitchell starring Tom Hanks and Halle Berry - runs for 171 minutes, and many other Oscar contenders are more than 150 minutes . One executive at the AMC (American Multi-Cinema) chain told the Sunday Times that he blamed Titanic and Avatar director James Cameron for ‘creating long “event” movies you had to see’. 'The . length of a film should be directly related to the endurance of the . human bladder' Alfred Hitchcock, late director . Some of the longest films in decades gone by on the big screen would come with an interval - and cinemas would often take that as a chance to sell food and drink to viewers, experts said. Famous long films from the past include 1963 classic Cleopatra, which ran for 242 minutes, the 229-minute Once Upon a Time in America from 1984 and 1962's 222-minute Lawrence of Arabia. Also among the longest films are Dr. Zhivago from 1965, which ran for 203 minutes, 1974's The Godfather Part II, which lasted 200 minutes, and the 195-minute Schindler's List from 1993. Channel 4 apologised today after coming under fire from Lord of the Rings fans for interrupting an emotional final scene from the last film in the trilogy with an advert for an upcoming programme. There was fury last night when a half-screen advert with a voiceover came on as Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellen) walked with Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) at the end of the 2003 film Return of the King. The advert was for 2010 film Robin Hood starring Russell Crowe, being shown on New Year's Day, and there was also a short trailer for 2011 film Wuthering Heights, which followed the programme. Tony McMahon said on Twitter: 'A new low in intrusive continuity announcing - Channel 4 makes an announcement during the closing scene of Lord of the Rings.' And David Smith ‏wrote: 'Well done, Channel 4. Well done. You just half-screened and talked over the last few seconds of nine hours of Lord of the Rings. Cretins.' A Channel 4 spokesman told MailOnline tonight: 'We take great care to ensure that continuity announcements are scheduled appropriately. 'But on this occasion a technical problem meant the announcement was broadcast earlier than planned. We’re sorry if it affected viewers’ enjoyment of the film.'

"The CEO of cash-strapped telecom start-up LightSquared has resigned amid controversy over his links to the Obama administration. Telecommunications industry veteran Sanjay Ahuja's departure was announced by the company on Tuesday. It comes after emails revealed his company's close contact with Obama officials as the firm was going under regulatory review. Just two weeks ago, the Federal . Communications Commission dealt the LightSquared a major blow by saying . it would bar it from building a wireless network that would interfere . with other satellite services. Resigned: Sanjiv Ahuja, pictured delivering a keynote in Orlando on March 23, has stepped down as CEO of LightSquared . Last week LightSquared said it would lay off nearly half of its staff of 330 to save money. This came days after it had failed to pay a $56.25million payment due to Inmarsat, a UK satellite company with which it has a spectrum-sharing agreement. While some industry analysts have speculated that bankruptcy might be on the cards, Falcone - whose Harbinger Capital Partners is the single biggest investor in LightSquared - ruled out that option. He said on Tuesday that the company is taking a more aggressive approach to its finances. Ahuja, who has served as CEO since 2010, will remain as chairman. LightSquared declined to elaborate on why he quit the top job. The company expects to complete its search for a new CEO 'in the near future,' according to a statement, which did not say who would stand in in the meantime. New addition: Hedge fund manager Philip Falcone has joined the board of the cash-strapped company backed by his firm Harbinger Capital Partners . LightSquared representatives declined to comment further. The company already has a shortlist of candidates with experience in the telecommunications industry and dealing with Washington politics, and hopes to decide on a new CEO in about a month, according to one person familiar with the executive search process who asked not to be named. After a bruising year of back and forth with lawmakers in Washington, Falcone shows no signs of backing down in his quest to gain approval to build a network. LightSquared will take 'an aggressive approach to its finances to ensure that it has adequate financial runway' while it continues to look for a way to build the network, Falcone said in a statement that gave no further details on his plans. The company has already hired investment bank Moelis & Co as a restructuring advisor, according to sources. Falcone invested more than 60 per cent of Harbinger's $4billion assets in LightSquared and his fund is the biggest equity owner. Last year Harbinger lost 47 per cent of its value after Falcone marked down the value of LightSquared in the portfolio. Falcone spent billions of dollars to buy spectrum licenses and pursue plans to build a high-speed wireless network on which LightSquared would offer wholesale services to other operators which are facing a scarcity of spectrum. But the bet turned sour when tests showed that the network LightSquared wanted to build would interfere with Global Positioning Systems that are used by everybody from airlines and the military to construction companies and farmers. LightSquared said that Chief Network Officer Doug Smith and Chief Financial Officer Marc Montagner will serve as interim co-chief operating officers.","Ahuja to stay as chairman of LightSquared .

"Kangaroos are descended from giant ten-foot (three metre tall) creatures that were too heavy to hop, new research suggests. Their extinct ancestors strode around the Australian outback 100,000 years ago, walking on two legs. It was only when kangaroos shrunk from 40 stone to a weight closer to their current seven-stone frame that they learned to bounce. Hop-less! Kangaroos are descended from giant ten-foot (three metres) creatures that were too heavy to hop, new research suggests. An illustration is pictured. Their extinct ancestors strode around the Australian outback 100,000 years ago, walking on two legs . Professor Christine Janis, from Brown University in Providence, US, said: ‘I don't think they could have gotten that large unless they were walking.’ The team, whose research was published last night in the journal PLOS One, analysed bones from more than 140 past and present kangaroo and wallaby skeletons, making nearly 100 measurements of each animal. Unlike modern red and grey kangaroos, the giant animals called sthenurine kangaroos that preceded them lacked specialised features geared for rapid hopping. Their bone structure indicated they had an upright posture and were able to support their weight on one foot at a time. It was only when kangaroos shrunk from 40 stone to a weight closer to their current seven-stone frame that they learned to bounce. Modern kangaroos are thought to have developed their distinctive hopping motion as an efficient way to travel the large distances needed to find food on the arid Australian outback (pictured) Large-bodied sthenurine kangaroos - a now extinct relative to modern-day kangaroos - first appeared in the middle Miocene period and became extinct in the late Pleistocene. They were too heavy to hop and instead walked on two legs. The largest of these kangaroos weighed around 38 stone (240kg) - almost three times as much as a modern kangaroo. Larger hip and knee joints, as well as more stable ankle joints, meant the large animals were more suited to walking. It was only when kangaroos shrunk from 40 stone to a weight closer to their current seven-stone frame that they learned to bounce. Modern kangaroos are thought to have developed their distinctive hopping motion as an efficient way to travel the large distances needed to find food on the arid Australian outback. The creatures had large hips and knees and stable ankle joints that would have helped them walk on two legs. Their hands were poorly suited for moving on all fours, but adapted for foraging. Modern kangaroos are thought to have developed their distinctive hopping motion as an efficient way to travel the large distances needed to find food on the arid Australian outback. Using elasticity in the tendons of their large legs to bounce is an effective, low-energy way to move at speed for long periods. But it only remains efficient if body weight remains low. The giant ancient kangaroos would simply have been too heavy, the scientists suggest. Professor Janis said: ‘People often interpret the behaviour of extinct animals as resembling that of the ones known today, but how would we interpret a giraffe or an elephant known only from the fossil record? ‘We need to consider that extinct animals may have been doing something different from any of the living forms, and the bony anatomy provides great clues.’ Whether or not reliance on walking rather than faster and more efficient hopping led to the ancient kangaoroos becoming extinct is unknown. Professor Janis said they may have struggled to elude human hunters, or been unable to migrate far enough to find food as the climate became more arid. In July, scientists from Colorado, Sydney and Burnaby in Canada discovered that a kangaroo’s tail provide as much driving force as their front and hind legs combined. 'We found that when a kangaroo is walking, it uses its tail just like a leg,' said Associate Professor Maxwell Donelan of Simon Fraser University in in Burnaby, Canada. ‘They use it to support, propel and power their motion. In fact, they perform as much mechanical work with their tails as we do with one of our legs.' 'What we didn't expect to find was how much power the tails of the kangaroos were producing. It was pretty darn surprising,’ said Associate Professor Rodger Kram at the University of Colorado Boulder. This summer, scientists discovered that a red kangaroo's tail provides as much driving force as their front and hind legs combined. The tail skeleton of a kangaoo is pictured right . Red kangaroos are the largest of the kangaroo species in Australia. When grazing on grass, they move both hind feet forward 'paired limb' style while using their tails and front limbs together to support their bodies. 'They appear to be awkward and ungainly walkers when one watches them moseying around in their mobs looking for something to eat,' said Professor Kram. 'But it turns out it is not really that awkward, just weird.' In human movement, the back foot acts as the gas pedal and the front foot acts as a brake, which is not especially efficient, said Professor Kram. Professor Donelan said no animal other than the kangaroo uses its tail like a leg. ‘Their tails have more than 20 vertebrae, taking on the role of our foot, calf, and thigh bones.' The kangaroo tail also boosts balance when male kangaroos grab each other by the chests or shoulders, then rear back and kick each other in the stomach in an attempt to assert dominance for the purpose of reproduction.","Kangaroos are descended from giant ten-foot (three metre tall) creatures .

"An Italian gymnast has provoked outrage after claiming the sport's first black world champion only won because of her skin colour. American Simone Biles, 16, made gymnastic history when she became the new all-round world champion on Friday. But moments after Carlotta Ferlito finished fifth, she told a journalist that she had joked with  teammate Vanessa Ferrari, who come fourth, that they should paint themselves black next time to stand a chance of winning. The 18-year-old told the interviewer: 'I told Vanny (Ferrari) that next time we should also paint our skin black, so then we could win too.' On her way to glory: Simone Biles, centre, picks up gold in the floor exercise competition on her way to becoming the first black world champion . Row: Italy's Carlotta Ferlito, pictured, said she joked with a teammate that they should paint themselves black next time to stand a chance of winning . She quickly took to twitter to apologise for the comments made on Friday at the World Championships in Antwerp, Belgium. On Tuesday, Ferlito tweeted: 'I want . to apologise with the Americans girls. I didn't want to sound rude or . racist. I love Simone and I'm a huge fan of USA gymnastics.' She . then added: 'I've made a mistake, I'm not perfect... I didn't think . about what I was saying. I'm just a human. I'm so so sorry.' Q. Well ready, set. Still a low score for your beam. How come?A. Now I will go ask Donatella. Q. Donatella Sacchi (judge and former Italian women's team technical director)?A. (Nodding) What they deducted because I really ... This time they were better in the execution because I started with two-tenths of a point lower in respect to the score. But, really the starting score, I understand since I didn't connect, but the execution, I don't know, I will ask, we'll see. Q. What about the success of (Simone) Biles, was it all planned?A. I told Vanny (Ferrari) that next time we should also paint our skin black, so then we could win too. (laughing) Source: Chicago Tribune . Outrage: Italian gymnast Carlotta Ferlito took to twitter to apologise for her comments can deny she was racist . But the row has now escalated after an . official in the Italian team tried to justify the comments in a posting . on Facebook, according to the Chicago Tribune. USA Gymnastics has demanded an explanation of subsequent comments made by an Italian Gymnastics Federation official David Ciaralli. According to the Chicago Tribune, he said: 'Carlotta was referring to a trend in gymnastics at this moment, which is going towards a technique that opens up new chances to athletes of colour (well-known for power) while penalising the more artistic Eastern European style that allowed Russians and Romanians to dominate the sport for years.' Bitter: Italian Carlotta Ferlito, left, made her gibe after finishing in fifth place behind American Simone Biles, right, who became the sport's first black world champion with victory in the all-round competition . He apparently added: 'Why are there no black swimmers? Because their physical features don’t suit the sport.' Ciaralli also said that black people 'may not have some of the necessities to be, let’s say, a field manager or a general manager' and that they aren’t good swimmers because they 'don’t have the buoyancy'. Mr Ciaralli has also apologised for his remarks, adding that they were not intended to reflect the officical view of the Italian Gymnastics Federation. But USA Gymnastics president Steve Penny said he was deeply disappointed by the comments, adding that racism should be stamped out of gymnastics. The row has not taken the shine off the stunning victory by Simone Biles. Speaking after winning the all-round competition got the best gymnast across a series of disciplines - including the floor, uneven bars - she said: 'It hasn't sunken in yet [that I am the world champion]. 'I am sure it will eventually, but we still have finals so we can't get too excited about it yet. But I know what I have done is a huge accomplishment and I am very happy.'","US gymnast Simone Biles, 16, became sport's first black world champion .

"Actor Ralf Little has been criticised after accusing Clarke Carlisle of not telling the full story . Actor Ralf Little has accused his former friend, Clarke Carlisle of not telling the 'full story' in his interview about the depression that led to his suicide attempt last year. The Royle Family star said Carlisle was going to 'get away with it again' in reference to his interview about a battle with depression that caused him to step in front of a lorry days before Christmas. Little tweeted a picture of the article, commenting: 'Oh dear. Looks like Clarke Carlisle's going to get away with it - AGAIN. #Teflon #nonstick.' His comment was met with a barrage of criticism from Twitter users, who accused him of being 'crass' and 'insensitive'. The actor wrote: 'Seems people want context about previous tweet. So let me say, I know the full story and it's not what's portrayed in the media. That's all.' Little and Carlisle had become friends in the early 2000s, but are thought to have fallen out when the footballer took the actor's bank card to fill Little's car with petrol. Instead, according to Carlisle's autobiography, he used the card to fund a drinking spree. Little did not refer to the incident, thought to have taken place in 2003, but admitted on Twitter that he should not have used such a forum to make the comment. Instead he wrote at length on the TwitLonger site to explain his view. The actor explained that he and Carlisle 'have history', and that while he wishes Carlisle a strong recovery he does not feel sad for him any more. However, he added he felt 'sad, and maybe a little angry' for Carlisle's wife Gemma, the footballer's children, and the lorry driver . He added that the former footballer had been in touch with him to offer 'a retrospective apology over things that went on a long time ago', but said he had been 'drained' of sympathy for him. Little wrote: 'There comes a point where it's just frustrating to witness someone constantly hammering the pattern of destruction for those around - and I was once one of those around - only to see the destructive force make a moving and sincere apology ... then do it again.' Clarke Carlisle was pictured for the first time since leaving hospital after after a collision with a lorry . Little felt 'sad, and maybe a little angry' for Carlisle's wife Gemma (pictured), his children, and the lorry driver . He added: 'Though, as a final thought, I would say again, I’m a fool for forgetting that Twitter is not, and never will be, the place for a comment like that. It’s too reductive and simplistic, and yes, without context, I can see it would seem insensitive and crass. Not my intention.' Carlisle later responded to the actor's tweets using his wife Gemma’s account. He wrote: 'Hi Ralf, it’s Clarke here. I have seen you once in 10 years, and that was to apologise for my repulsive behaviour as a young man. 'I know you have you're right to your opinion, but I've got to say, I sincerely hope that you're not the same person you were 10 years ago, as I very much am not. I hope you are well, happy and enjoying your excellent career. I pray depression never bites x' In his autobiography, You Don't Know Me, But...: A Footballer's Life, Carlisle wrote about his friendship with Little. He explained in his book that he had befriended Little and his two housemates  - a radio producer and band manager - after realising that he needed to make friends outside of football in order to keep his heavy drinking a secret from his team-mates. Describing Little as a 'very self-assured guy', Carlisle wrote that for his new friend 'everything had an element of competition, whether it was drinking, dancing, women, Pro-Evolution Soccer, income, level of fame, everything.' The actor had posted a series of Tweets including one which read 'Oh dear. Looks like Clarke Carlisle's going to get away with it - AGAIN' He added: 'This triggered two things within me. Firstly, I wanted to be liked by all of these guys. This meant that I would say yes to everything. If there was a party I was there, a drink to be had I was there, an event to be seen at I was there. I wanted to be a part of the group. Secondly, I wanted to win. This may sound pathetic, but it is where I was at. I wanted to be cooler, I wanted to party harder, I wanted to be richer (or look richer if I wasn't), I wanted to impress him and everyone around us.' Carlisle also said Little was 'desperate to be a footballer and genuinely believed he was good enough,' which had in turn spurred him on to live the actor's lifestyle and be a professional footballer. Speaking of the bank card incident he wrote: 'It was so bad in my drinking days that at one point Ralf lent me his bank card to get some petrol for his car, but I took it to go on a bender for a couple of days, helping myself to cash out of his personal account. In his autobiography Carlisle had written that Little, pictured at a Soccer Six event, was 'desperate to be a footballer and believed he was good enough' 'I still cringe to this day when I think back to some of those times when I was at my most desperate. 'It is part of my recovery programme to try to make amends to all those who you have wronged on your journey. 'I have repeatedly repented to all of my housemates, some of whom accepted it and some of whom didn't. I'm fine about that - just because I apologise doesn't make everything better. I had to face the consequences of my actions, which in this case meant I lost several friendships that I will never get back.' Carlisle was left critically injured when he was struck by a lorry near his home on the morning of December 22 on the A64, near York. He had to be airlifted to Leeds General Infirmary, with North Yorkshire Police confirming that an investigation was under way after a collision that ‘involved a male pedestrian and a lorry’. Speaking to the The Sun newspaper he said he had thrown himself in front of the lorry in an attempt to take his own life, adding that his life had spiralled out of control after being told by ITV he was losing his £100,000-a-year Champions League pundit role. He says he went straight to a casino and blew in one night what money he and his wife had before, only hours later on December 20, being charged with drink-driving. Carlisle, who is also a former chairman of the Professional Footballers' Association, was due to appear at Highbury Magistrates' Court, in north London, last month to face the drink-driving charge but the hearing was adjourned until March. ‘I had to die,’ he said. ‘This wasn’t escaping or running away. This was the perfect answer. It made everyone happy and it ticked every box.’ He said he had sat in the police cell and concluded that he could not let his children ‘have a criminal father’. He said he walked out of the police station having decided he ‘had to die’. Carlisle says he then vanished for 40 hours, sleeping rough while planning his suicide. Having found a spot on the A64, he then stepped over a barrier and jumped towards an oncoming lorry ‘like a shoulder charge’. Carlisle said he had wanted to emulate Little's lifestyle. The actor is pictured with Steve Coogan and Johnny Vegas at a film premiere in 2002 - around the time he was friendly with Carlisle . ‘I opened my eyes and I could see my hands in front of me and there’s blood dripping down them. I thought, “You’re kidding me”.’ At hospital it was discovered he had suffered only cuts, bruises, internal bleeding, a broken rib and a shattered left knee. He said he had ‘overwhelming feelings of shame, guilt and embarrassment’ On Christmas Day, Carlisle was admitted to a psychiatric unit in Harrogate and placed on suicide watch. He is now having counselling, with The Sun claiming the police are taking no further action over the A64 crash.

"Fitness guru Kayla Itsines is famous for sharing photos of her clients amazing before-and-after body transformations with her million-plus Instagram followers. But the 23-year-old personal trainer from Adelaide, who has become an internet sensation thanks to her bikini body guide, has now showed how she  helped  a young woman who suffered from  anorexia get fit and healthy. On Saturday Kayla shared the before and after selfie photos of Mikhaela Antoon, 17, from Sydney, showing her journey back to health after suffering from the eating disorder for four years. Scroll down for video . Recovery: Mikhaela Antoon fought her way back from anorexia with Kayla Itsines' health and fitness regime . Super fit: Kayla inspires women to achieve good health by posting shots of her and her client's transformations . In the after shot, despite still looking slim, Mikhaela can be seen looking happy, fit, toned and healthy as she shows off her right bicep in a classic fitness pose. The pose is typical of the pictures Kayla shares to her followers of herself after a work out. Mikhaela’s stomach also looks incredibly toned in the after picture - a stark contrast to the before photo, which shows the young woman on the beach looking dangerously thin. Kayla commented on her client’s 'amazing result' and shared the email Mikhaela had written to her: . 'I can't thank you enough Kayla,' the email read. ‘I have struggled with anorexia for four years now. ‘With the help of both your guides, I have finally found my place between a healthy mind set and healthy lifestyle. Idol: Mikhaela's picture (left) is typical of something Kayla (right) would share of herself after a workout, showing that she has found a healthy mentor in the Instagram star . Progress: With what looks like a school picture of herself in the corner, Mikhaela showed off a healthier figure . ‘I thank you for being such a positive role model and for your dedication to your work. ‘Every day I wake up feeling stronger and healthier all thanks to YOU!""’ Following the encouraging email Kayla reiterated her health and fitness message saying: ‘It doesn't matter what shape or size you are. 'EVERYONE achieves the same results, HEALTHY, lean, toned, strong and confident. ‘These things are all achieved, and are results of, hard work and dedication!’ More than 29,000 followers liked the post and many commented with supportive comments. One said: ‘Yes! Such a transformation,’ while another wrote: ‘So inspiring.’ Glowing: Mikhaela has said she has finally found my place between a healthy mind set and healthy lifestyle . Definition: Three weeks ago the Sydneysider shared this pic of herself working out, captioned: 'Back to the grind.' Since becoming healthier, Mikhaela appears to be in a   happy frame of mind and her Instagram account is littered with pictures of her not only working out, but also enjoying delicious  meals. She also regularly shares pictures of inspiring sayings which include: 'Your health is your greatest wealth' and 'Feeling strong is the best feeling.' But perhaps most tellingly, just over a year ago she uploaded a post which read: 'Dear Past, thank you for all the lessons. Dear Future I am ready.' Fitness star: The 23-year-old trainer regularly shares selfies of herself looking enviably toned and trim . Strength: Photos and videos show the brunette's strength and her love of working out with weights . Kayla certainly seems to have mastered the equation needed to achieve a healthy physique, coupled with a high level of fitness and strength without bulk. The successful business woman now has a staggering 1,190, 484 Instagram followers at last count, which included Victoria’s Secret angel Candice Swanepoel. On her website she explains how she began personal training in 2008 and quickly realised that she wanted to start helping women achieve a bikini body in the most 'efficient and effective way possible’. She adds: ‘My clients saw amazing results in 12 weeks or sometimes even sooner, and began to tell their friends and spread an amazing positive message.’ Earlier this month Kayla, who regularly shares pictures and videos of herself working out, spoke to Femail about her popular workout and meal plan. Her rules include always eating breakfast, 'even if you don’t necessarily feel like it. Having a good serve of protein, carbs and fats in the morning is the best way for you to start the day. You will have lots more energy to keep you going until lunch time.' Abs-olutely fabulous: She says anyone can obtain these results and be lean, toned and healthy . She also recommended to eat three main meals and two small snacks a day. Kayla’s bikini body workout consists of targeted circuits which aim to work on specific ‘problem’ areas of the body while also burning calories. Her diet plan aims to give you plenty of energy for her intense workouts, while reducing fat and calories to help you slim down.","The 17-year-old young woman suffered with anorexia for four years .

"A personal trainer has become an internet sensation with her bikini body guide earning her an astonishing 700,000 Instagram followers, including Victoria’s Secret angel Candice Swanepoel. Kayla Itsines, 23, from Adelaide, South Australia, works with clients near her home but has gained worldwide notoriety through her social media accounts where she shows off the enviable results of her regime. With a body that would not look out of place on a catwalk, Kayla seems to have mastered the equation needed for an ultra slim and lean physique, coupled with a high level of fitness and strength without bulk. Kayla Itsines now has nearly 700,000 followers on Instagram alone, all looking to achieve a body similar to hers . Kayla, who works as a personal trainer in Adelaide, Australia, began gaining fans online by posting pictures of herself and her own workouts . Kayla seems to have mastered the equation needed for an ultra slim and lean physique, coupled with a high level of fitness and strength without bulk . Demand from followers to know how she achieved her body was so high that Kayla released an ebook so fans could follow her high intensity workouts at home with minimal equipment. Speaking to MailOnline, Kayla explains: ‘I have always been healthy and fit. Whether it was basketball, other sport or just working out. I am far too impatient to not do something with my time. ‘Now my mission is what inspires me. I have a dream to end confusion within the health and fitness industry. Fads and scams in this industry have created so much distrust and insecurity around weight-loss programs. ‘I want all people to understand their body, have a place to learn about health and fitness and in turn feel confident & happy. I was always a little “too skinny” during my childhood and often got bullied for it. ‘I put in years of training and research to try to get my body to where it is today. Now I am in a position where I can educate girls to gain OR lose weight to get their dream body. Everyone’s goal appearance is different, but the goal is still really confidence.’ Hundreds of girls who follow Kayla's 12 week guide post their own before and after pictures to her . Kayla says her aim is to counter the distrust and insecurity around weight-loss programs created by fad diets and scams . So many people enjoyed the training style in my videos and kept requesting that I release a book of workouts so in January 2014 I released a training program and nutritional guidelines that are for women only.’ Kayla, who doesn't touch alcohol, is the first to admit that obtaining the ‘perfect’ body or getting into shape isn't easy, and her Instagram account is filled with motivational tips and phrases as well as details of her low fat healthy meals. However, the Instagram star is all about balance, shunning extreme or fad diets, and admits she allows herself to indulge every now and again. ‘If I'm not at the gym, I'm usually at the park with my Siberian Husky. I like to spend as much time as possible outside, even if I'm not training. ‘I do have a weak spot for Tiramisu but because I am lactose intolerant and this has dairy in it, I can only have it once every so often… but this is probably a good thing!’ Although she admits staying in shape and losing weight can be hard, Kayla also allows herself to indulge every now and again . Kayla's workouts are all about high intensity circuits which focus on problem areas as well as burning as much fat as possible in the shortest time . Her realistic and honest approach, as much as the advert of her body, is what has made Kayla so popular online. Currently with over 700,000 followers on Instagram, 145,595 likes on Facebook, and over 40,000 twitter followers, Kayla says her time sensitive workouts are key to her success. ‘I feel extremely lucky to have such amazing online followers, who I am able to chat to on a daily basis! It's definitely one of the best parts of my job. ‘My training concept in the Bikini Body Guide is about getting the most out of a limited amount of time. In today’s society most people are time poor so I wanted to help them burn as much fat as fast as possible in as little time as possible without sacrificing quality of training. ‘By applying science-based concepts to my particular style of training I was able to get the outcomes that girls wanted, such as flat stomachs, toned thighs, and strong, slim arms.’ As well as thousands of girls, hundreds of whom send her their before and after pictures following completing her 12 week guide, Kayla has drawn attention from some of the most lusted after women on the planet. Renowned for their bodies and intense workouts, Victoria Secret model Candice Swanepoel is one of Kayla’s fans. ‘Candice Swanepoel follows me. This was such an amazing moment for me. Candice has been one of my favourite models for such a long time.

"Posing with an assault rifle after joining rebels fighting the Syrian regime, this is the British son of a suspected Al Qaeda mastermind. Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, 23, is the latest in a growing stream of young men to join militant groups in the war-torn Middle Eastern country. He walked out of his family's £1million home several months ago telling them he was 'leaving everything for the sake of Allah'. Abdel-Majed abdel Bary, 23, also known as rapper Lyricist Jinn, who has gone to Syria to fight as a jihadist . Friends said Bary – an aspiring rapper on the 'grime' music scene – grew increasingly radical and violent after mixing with thugs linked to hate preacher Anjem Choudary. He has posted a series of photographs online, including shots of him masked and posing with guns under the title 'soldier of Allah'. In other messages he called on Allah to 'grant us martyrdom', and praised Osama Bin Laden. Bary, whose music has featured on Radio 1, is one of six children of Adel Abdul Bary, 53. Bary Snr was extradited from Britain to the US 14 months ago after an eight-year legal battle that made him a cause celebre of the Left as lawyers took his publicly funded case to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. Investigators believe Bary Snr was one of Bin Laden's closest lieutenants in the infancy of Al Qaeda and ran a London cell of the terror network. He faces life in prison if convicted of involvement in the bombings of US embassies in East Africa in 1998. His son's appearance among the ranks of UK jihadists in Syria, where several Britons fighting for the militants have already been killed, will add to concerns about their potential threat to the West. In the video Bary raps about taking part in a war on terror over images of Barack Obama and David Cameron . Bary lived with his mother Ragaa for more than a decade in a home in Maida Vale, West London, owned by Westminster Council. If it were sold on the open market it would be worth £1million. She travelled to Britain from Egypt in 1990 after her husband was granted refugee status. Friends said Bary's conversion to radical Islam happened as he grew increasingly frustrated with the British authorities over the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. And it came despite his fledgling success on the underground grime music scene, where he rapped under the names Lyricist Jinn and L Jinny. Bary appeared in dozens of videos, including one in which he posed outside the Bank of England and declared his allegiance to the global hacking group Anonymous. On July 1, he announced that he was turning his back on music as 'I have left everything for the sake of Allah'. It is understood that soon afterwards he travelled to Syria, where one of his oldest friends had already joined the fighting. He changed his Twitter name to Soldier of Allah and posed for pictures wearing a mask and military fatigues while carrying an AK-47 and other large assault rifles. Bary lived with his mother Ragaa for more than a decade in a home in Maida Vale, West London, owned by Westminster Council . Last month he said, 'Oh Allah, grant us martyrdom' and praised Bin Laden, calling him a 'lion'.Referring to conditions in Syria, he said it is the 'real jungle out here'. A Metropolitan Police spokesman refused to confirm whether the force's counter terrorism unit is aware of Bary's trip to Syria or his violent internet boasts. 'We are investigating a number of individuals who are believed to have travelled to Syria to engage in the conflict but are unable to comment on any specific case for operational reasons,' he said. 'Travelling abroad for the purpose of engaging in terrorist related activity is an offence and we will seek to prosecute, where possible, anyone engaged in this type of activity. The police work with partners to identify these individuals of concern in order to manage the risk they may pose. 'We are also keen to prevent young and vulnerable individuals becoming engaged in this type of activity and would urge anyone who is concerned about relatives or friends that they believe to be susceptible to, or involved in this sort of activity to get in touch with us.'","Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, 23, flew out several months ago .

"Actor Ralf Little has been criticised after accusing Clarke Carlisle of not telling the full story . Clarke  Carlisle became embroiled in a bizarre row with actor Ralf Little after confirming he had tried to take his own life when he threw himself in front of a lorry in December. The 35-year-old former Premier League footballer and PFA chairman probably expected nothing but sympathy when he spoke of the battle against depression that led to the suicide attempt which left him in hospital for six weeks. But Carlisle came under fire from his one-time friend and flatmate Little, 34, who in turn faced accusations of being insensitive to mental illness. Carlisle was left critically injured when he was struck by a lorry close to his home on the morning of December 22 on the A64 near York. Speaking to The Sun, Carlisle said his life had spiralled out of control after being told by ITV that he was losing his £100,000-a-year role as a Champions League pundit. He says he went straight to a casino on December 20 and blew in one night all the money he and his wife had saved. He was charged with drink-driving a few hours later. Carlisle was due to appear at Highbury Magistrates’ Court in north London last month to face the drink-driving charge but the hearing was adjourned until next month. ‘I had to die,’ he said. ‘This wasn’t escaping or running away. This was the perfect answer. It made everyone happy and it ticked every box.’ But on Twitter a row developed when The Royle Family star Little accused Carlisle of not telling the full story in his interview. Little said Carlisle was going to ‘get away with it again’, referring to him as ‘Teflon’. In response to a barrage of criticism, the actor then tried to qualify his comment. ‘Seems people want context about previous tweet,’ he wrote. ‘So let me say, I know the full story and it’s not what’s portrayed in the media. That’s all.’ Clarke Carlisle was pictured for the first time since leaving hospital after after a collision with a lorry . Little felt 'sad, and maybe a little angry' for Carlisle's wife Gemma (pictured), his children, and the lorry driver . Little and Carlisle became friends in the early 2000s, but are thought to have fallen out when the footballer took the actor’s bank card to fill Little’s car with petrol. Instead, according to Carlisle’s autobiography, he used the card to fund a drinking spree. Little explained that he and Carlisle ‘have history’ and that while he wishes his former friend a strong recovery he does not feel sad for him any more. He said he had sympathy only for Carlisle’s wife, Gemma, the footballer’s children, and the lorry driver. Carlisle then responded using Gemma’s Twitter account, apologising once again for what had happened in the past. But Little wrote: ‘There comes a point where it’s just frustrating to witness someone hammering the pattern of destruction for those around — and I was once one of those around — only to see the destructive force make a moving and sincere apology... then do it again.’ The actor had posted a series of Tweets including one which read 'Oh dear. Looks like Clarke Carlisle's going to get away with it - AGAIN' On Christmas Day, Carlisle was admitted to a psychiatric unit in Harrogate and placed on suicide watch. He is now having counselling, with The Sun claiming the police are taking no further action over the A64 incident. Little made the point that it was not the first time Carlisle had been charged with drink-driving — he has been banned in the past. As a player it is understood he sometimes caused his managers problems by disappearing on drinking binges.

"Cricketer Moeen Ali has been told to stop wearing his 'Save Gaza' and 'Free Palestine' wristbands while playing for England by the International Cricket Council. The 27-year-old all-rounder from Birmingham walked onto the pitch in Southampton today apparently free from the plastic bands he wore yesterday declaring his support for the population of Gaza. England were prepared to let Ali continue wearing the wristbands during the remainder of the third Investec Test against India, but the ICC has ruled that its international sports arena was not the place for the British Muslim's show of solidarity. He has not been charged or punished, but simply told the wristbands must go when he is out on the field. Empty wrists: Ali, seen on the pitch today, was not wearing the pro-Gaza bands after the ICC told him not to . Yesterday and today: The 27-year-old's wristbands were obvious yesterday, but he removed them today, right . Got to go: The International Cricket Council ruled that Ali must not wear 'Free Palestine' and 'Save Gaza' bands . Statement: Moeen Ali batted for England against India yesterday in political wristbands that read 'Save Gaza' Fundraiser: Ali featured in a Twitter post by the Ummah Welfare Trust after he helped raise money for the people of Gaza in his home city of Birmingham . A spokesman for the world governing body said: 'The ICC equipment and clothing regulations do not permit the display of messages that relate to political, religious or racial activities or causes during an international match. 'Moeen Ali was told by the match referee that, while he is free to express his views on such causes away from the cricket field, he is not permitted to wear the wristbands on the field of play and warned not to wear the bands again during an international match.' The England and Wales Cricket Board was unaware beforehand of Moeen's plans to wear the wristbands but was not planning unilaterally to ask him to take them off until the ICC made it clear he must. The body’s code reads: ‘Players and team officials shall not be permitted to wear, display or otherwise convey messages through arm bands or other items affixed to clothing or equipment unless approved in advance by the player or team official’s Board.'Approval shall not be granted for messages which relate to political, religious or racial activities or causes.’ The English Cricket Board (ECB) said that Ali did not ask for permission to wear the wristbands. Ali, a practising Muslim of Pakistani descent, wore the black-and-white bands on his wrist yesterday as he batted for England at the Ageas Bowl in Southampton. Ali stands with Ian Bell during England first innings in Southampton yesterday - he made 12 runs . Not his day: Ali scored 12 runs towards England's first innings total at the Ageas Bowl yesterday . He was pictured this week raising funds for the victims of the conflict in Gaza with the Ummah Welfare Trust in Small Heath, Birmingham. According to the United Nations, almost 1,100 people, including many civilians, have been killed during the fighting, with Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon saying on Monday that the territory was in a 'critical condition.' A UN statement released over the weekend designed to encourage a lasting cease fire between Israel and Hamas, expressed 'grave concern regarding the deterioration in the situation as a result of the crisis related to Gaza and the loss of civilian lives and casualties.' Meanwhile, bands showing support for the wounded soldiers charity Help for Heroes are allowed because it is a charity and not a political, racial or religious cause.","All-rounder Ali, 27, wore black and white wristbands while batting yesterday .

"The Ministry of Justice said today it would be 'difficult or impossible' for convicted rapist Ched Evans to play football abroad due to the terms of his licence . He has denied his guilt and failed to apologise to the teenage girl he is convicted of raping in a hotel room since being released from prison, with his long-term partner claiming all he wants to do is return to football. But  rapist Ched Evans'  may never play professionally again,with terms of his sex offender's licence rendering it near impossible for him to work abroad, the Ministry of Justice said today. It comes after the 25-year-old's former club, Sheffield United, revoked his invitation to train on their grounds this week. No other British clubs have expressed interest in signing the criminal since his early release from Wymott Prison on October 17 despite the Professional Footballers' Association saying yesterday it hoped he would be made an offer. Rumours swirled Evans may have been picked up by the Irish Professional Footballers' Association after its lawyer wrote an online article claiming he could be innocent. However it was said today  it would be 'difficult or impossible' for a sex offender to meet the terms of their licence while working abroad. 'We do not comment on individual prisoners. 'In general terms, a sex offender on licence would have to have regular meetings with their offender manager and that is difficult or impossible to do if they are living abroad,' a spokesman told MailOnline this morning. Evans, who plans to appeal his 2012 conviction for raping a teenage waitress in a hotel in Rhyl, North Wales, served just half of the five-year sentence he handed. The remainder of the sentence will be completed on licence, meaning he must regularly check in with an offender manager until 2016. By the time he has completed his entire sentence, he will be 27, and will remain on the Sex Offenders Register for life. Following his release last month, pressure mounted on Sheffield United not to resign the player or welcome him back to its grounds. A string of its patrons tendered their resignations over the issue, with Olympian Jessica Ennis-Hill vowing to have her name removed from one of the stands at Bramall Lane should he be reinstated. After failing to take a public stance for days, the club revealed Evans would be allowed to train with former teammates but did not invite him to return permanently. Their invitation was revoked this week after mass public outcry.  In a statement, the club said the public reaction to their actions could not have been 'anticipated'. 'The Club initially accepted a request from The PFA for Ched Evans to be able to train. The reaction to this has been at an intensity that could not have been anticipated when first announced. The athlete, who used to play for Sheffield United (right), had his invitation to train at the club revoked following mass public outcry . The former footballer, pictured with his long-term girlfriend Natasha Massey, has protested his innocence despite being convicted of raping a teenage girl in 2011 . 'The club condemns rape and violence of any kind against women in the strongest possible terms.' The Professional Footballers' Association accepted the club's decision, but added it hoped Evans would be given a job elsewhere. 'It may ultimately be of benefit to both parties to move on and for Ched to look for a fresh start at a different club. 'It is hoped that Ched will be given an opportunity at another club to return to the job he is trained to do,' a statement released yesterday read. Sheffield United co-chairman Jim Phipps argued condemned the decision as unfair, saying he was 'angry' Evans wasn't given a second chance. ‘I’m angry we are not able to get a chance to do for this footballer what should be done,’ said Phipps. ‘I’m upset that we are not able to do what we wanted to do, but I acknowledge that my view is not the only view. My principles and the board’s principles are not the only thing that matter. ‘The influence of mob-like behaviour has made it difficult to take the simple step of allowing Ched to train.' Earlier this week, the Irish Professional Footballers' Association's lawyer wrote an online article claiming the former player could be innocent. Likening the situation to that of the Guildford Four, who had their convictions over the Guildford Bombing quashed following a lengthy public campaign, Stuart Gilhooly wrote: 'This crime, as alleged, was at the bottom end. Before his release the former athlete's long-term girlfriend Natasha Massey said 'all he wanted to do' was return to his professional career . Jessica Ennis-Hill (left) vowed to have her name removed from one of Sheffield United's stands and Charlie Webster (right) resigned her patronage over the issue . Sheffield United revoked Evans' invitation to train with his former teammates in light of the public outcry . Sheffield United co-chairman Jim Phipps said he was 'angry' the club had been forced to retract its invitation for Ched Evans to train there again and likened public outcry to 'mob-like behaviour' 'There was no violence and thankfully the victim has no recollection of it. This, I hasten to add, does not make it right, or anything close to it, but it is nonetheless a mitigating factor.' It has since been removed from PFA Ireland's website. Last month Charlie Webster resigned as a patron of Sheffield United: 'It influences the next generation and I don’t believe it is sending out the right message to employ a convicted rapist. ‘I won’t stand here and represent that. Not in my name, not in my community and not in my club.’ In September, the former footballer's long-term girlfriend, Natasha Massey. said 'all he wanted to do' was to return to his professional sporting career. Speaking ahead of his dawn release, she told the Daily Mirror:  'He's a professional footballer and he just wants to get on the pitch and score goals. It think he should be allowed to do that. 'All Ched wants to do is go back to work, do the job he loves and then just come home and have a family life.' May 30, 2011: CCTV shows footballer Clayton McDonald meeting victim outside a kebab shop in Rhyl at around 4am, before taking a cab with her to a nearby Premier Inn. On the way he texts friend Ched Evans to say he's 'got a bird'. Mr McDonald and Evans both had intercourse with the girl, and at one point two other men tried to film it though a window. After waking up in the hotel room with no memory of the incident, the victim went to police, and later the same day Evans and Mr McDonald are both arrested. July 26, 2011:  Evans and Mr McDonald are charged with rape, which they both deny. April 11, 2012: Evans and Mr McDonald take the stand for the first time at Caernarfon Crown Court. April 20: Mr McDonald is acquitted of rape, while Evans is found guilty and sentenced to five years in prison. During the trial Evans told the court that he had gone to the hotel after getting a text from Mr McDonald, and let himself into the room where he found the pair having sex. He claimed to have watched them before having sex with the victim himself, while two other men watched through the window and attempted to film it. April 23: The victim is named for the first time online by supporters of Evans, who begin bombarding her with abuse that police will later compare to 'virtual GBH'. Officers subsequently take the unusual step of giving the woman a false identity and moving her away from her home - protection usually reserved for high-profile murderers released from jail. August: Evans has request to appeal his conviction turned down, though this is later overturned by the Court of Appeal in London. November, 2013: Evans continues to deny guilt and recruits new legal team to help clear his name. October 17, 2014: He is released from jail after serving half of his sentence and returns home to Rhyl where a bouncy castle is pictured being delivered to his parents' house, but is later taken away. October 18: Reports surface that Evans has been offered a £500,000 contract to re-sign for Sheffield United, though the club later deny the rumours. November 11: After a request from the Professional Footballers' Association, Sheffield United agree to allow Evans to return to the club to train, but refuse to say whether he will be signed. The same day patron Charlie Webster, who was abused as a child, walks away from the club. November 12: Lindsay Graham, another club patron, cuts her ties with the club along with another unnamed patron as 150,000 sign petition saying Evans should not be allowed to play again. November 13: Jessica Ennis-Hill asks for her name to be removed from one of the club's stands, leading to abuse on Twitter. November 17: Karl Massey, the millionaire father of Evans' girlfriend Natasha Massey, says he will offer the former-footballer a job at one of his firms if the club will not have him back . November 20: Sheffield United confirm that they have withdrawn the offer to allow Evans to train at their ground. November 22:  The Ministry of Justice said while it cannot comment on individual prisoners, in general terms the terms of a sex offender's licence would render it near impossible to work abroad, scuppering any hopes that Evans may be signed overseas for the remainder of his sentence.","Ched Evans may never play professionally again due to terms of licence .

"At least five people have been injured after mounted police rode into a large group of anti-Nazi protestors during a demonstration in Malmo, Sweden. More than 2,000 people had turned up to protest against a meeting held by the neo-Nazi Svenskarnas Parti (The Swedes’ Party) in a square near the Oresund Bridge which connects Sweden and Denmark on Saturday afternoon. The protest soon turned violent, with activists attacking police and horses, and in an attempt to disperse the crowd, police rode in full gallop through a group of 300-400 people.

"Smiling Connor Levy is a happy, healthy newborn. But there’s something special about him – because he gives hope to thousands of women desperate to become mothers. His parents are the first in the world to benefit from a fertility test which promises to revolutionise IVF – and could be cheap enough for widespread use on the NHS. The Oxford University DNA test helps fertility doctors select only the best embryos. Doing this could almost guarantee some women a baby. Bundle of joy: Connor was conceived using the new fertility test developed at Oxford University . His mother and father, Marybeth Scheidts, 36, and David Levy, 41, had been trying to start a family for five years and feared they would never have a baby. Then Connor was born seven weeks ago weighing 7lb 15oz. Miss Scheidts told the Mail: ‘The first time I saw Connor, I was smashed with emotion. David and I are crazy, insanely in love with this kid.’ The couple, who live in Philadelphia, took part in a small-scale trial of the test which aims to increase the success rates of IVF. Currently as few as a quarter of IVF attempts lead to a birth. Ecstatic: Marybeth Scheidtz and David Levy were delighted to have Connor after taking part in a small-scale trial of the test which aims to increase the success rates of IVF . The test uses cutting-edge technology . called next generation sequencing to find out whether embryos have just . the right number of chromosomes. The . European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology’s annual . conference heard that many eggs contain too many or too few chromosomes. This stops any pregnancy from taking place or leads to a miscarriage. Having too many chromosomes can lead to conditions such as Down’s syndrome. Examination: The test uses cutting-edge technology called next generation sequencing to find out whether embryos have just the right number of chromosomes . Therefore the test should also boost . the odds of babies born by IVF being healthy. It would also cut the . financial costs of IVF. Several . tests are already available but Oxford University’s Dr Dagan Wells . believes that his will be half the cost of its rivals. Couples face . paying up to £15,000 per course of IVF, plus £2,000 to £3,000 for . chromosomal testing. The . test can also look for genes behind rare diseases and assess the health . of the mitochondria – the ‘batteries’ inside cells that turn the food . we eat into energy. Defects in these cause around 50 genetic diseases, many of which kill in infancy or lead to miscarriages. Discovery The Oxford University (pictured) DNA test helps fertility doctors select only the best embryos. Doing this could almost guarantee some women a baby . When all three features are taken into account, it is hoped the test will boost the odds of pregnancy by around a third. Used on relatively young women in the best clinics, it could take the odds of pregnancy to almost 80 per cent per attempt. It is thought that the main beneficiaries of the test will be women in their 30s. The embryos of those aged 40-plus carry more defects, so too few could be produced for the test to be used. A large-scale trial is planned for the UK later this year which, if successful, could mean the test will be available through private clinics in as little as 18 months. However, some raised fears that the test could be exploited to give couples ‘designer’ babies with a certain eye or hair colour. Roy Farquharson, of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology, warned that the law would have to be amended to limit the genes that could be hunted out by the test.","Connor Levy was born using a revolutionary new fertility test .

"A day without tea is a day without joy, goes the Chinese proverb. And Britain has more than adopted this notion over the last 370 years, as the hot milky drink is the nation's most popular choice. The ubiquitous cuppa is as much a part of British life as indifferent weather or the BBC. The drink, since its arrival here in the 17th century, has shaped our history, our culture and our lives. Tea time: The hot milky drink is now the nation's most popular choice after tap water . A new book charts its fascinating story from its origins to its arrival in Britain in the 1660s, to its development as something quintessentially British, slowly but surely integrating itself into our culture, language and society. Written by famed food author Paul Chrystal, Tea: A Very British Beverage charts our loss of the American colonies, the Opium Wars, female emancipation and victory in the Second World War. These events all owe something to a nice cup of tea, according to the author. 'Tea is synonymous with [the nation]. The story of our intimate relationship with tea is in effect the social history of Britain,' says Paul. The beverage reflects aspects of the nation's trade, manners, fashion, art, drinking habits, industrial legislation, foreign policy, and health. So put the kettle and learn ten weird and wonderful bits of tea trivia selected and edited by Femail, from the book. Some is legend... but most of it's true, especially the last one (Note: It's tea first, then milk, then take the tea bag out - and no sugar!). Who wants a cuppa? Uniformed waitresses known as Nippies serving tea to disabled ex-servicemen in the Coventry Street Lyons Corner House . Britons drink 165 MILLION cups per day . On average we each drink 3.5 cups of tea every day, which totals 165 million cups per day or 62 billion cups per year. Seven in ten of the population (over age 10) drank tea yesterday; and more than 25 per cent of all the milk consumed in the UK goes into your cup of tea. Why does tea keep you awake? Not caffeine... One of the legends surrounding the origin of the cup of tea tells how Bodhidharma, an Indian prince who embraced Zen Buddhism in the 6th century BC, travelled to China to spread the faith. Meditation could be a 24-hour occupation. One night he (not unreasonably) fell asleep after meditating in front of a wall for nine years. He angrily cut off his eyelids to prevent a recurrence, and legend says the discarded lids grew into the first tea plant: 'Cast to the ground, the severed eyelids grew into a tea plant which, when brewed, could banish sleep!' Monkey pluckers: Enlisting angry monkeys in the harvesting of tea in China, a traditional method . Tea was harvested by angry monkeys . One of the ways in which tea was harvested was in a village in which monkeys pick the tea: the villagers stand below the monkeys and annoy them; the monkeys get angry, grab handfuls of tea leaves and throw them down at the villagers. Nowadays 'Monkey-picked tea' (Ma nau mi ti kuan yin) is extremely rare but still available. It's a wild Chinese tea containing powerful antioxidants, and picked only by specially trained monkeys. The drink that delivered boozy Britain from the cold . The arrival of tea in Britain was perfectly captured by the American Agnes Repplier in her 1931 essay, To Think of Tea!: . 'Tea had come as a deliverer to a land that called for deliverance; a land of beef and ale, of heavy eating and abundant drunkenness; of grey skies and harsh winds; of strong nerved, stout-purposed, slow-thinking men and women. 'Above all, a land of sheltered homes and warm firesides - firesides that were waiting - waiting for the bubbling kettle and the fragrant breath of tea.' Methodists think tea causes paralysis... and death . John Wesley (1703 - 1791) is credited as one of the founders of the evangelical movement known as Methodism. One might assume, in his pursuit of virtue, he would have been an advocate of the social, medical and psychological benefits of tea, particularly as he was known to drink it. Not so. He preached that it caused 'numberless disorders, particularly those of a nervous kind' and was alarmed by 'some Symptoms of a Paralytick disorder… when you drink tea it has brought you near the chambers of death'. Mad hatter's tea party: Just one of the quirky features of the Alice in Wonderland-themed Curious Tea Rooms in Frederick Street, Edinburgh . Tea leads men to idleness and women to prostitution . William Cobbett (1763 - 1835), a well-known beer swigger, believed that tea leads men and boys to idleness. It encourages 'a softness, an effeminacy, a seeking for the fireside, a lurking in the bed, and in short, all the characteristics of idleness' he said. But for women, the beverage apparently, leads them to prostitution. It 'does little less for the girls, to whom the gossip of the tea-table is no bad preparatory school for the brothel'. Drinking tea makes women ugly . According to Jonas Hanway in 1756, tea will 'convulse the bowels' and causes bad teeth, particularly amongst the ladies. Hanway insinuated that tea drinking amongst women made them ugly: 'there is not quite so much beauty in this land as there was'. He asserted that the children of poor mothers were dying because their mothers were spending their money on tea: 'those will have tea who have not bread'. Mirror, mirror: In Bettys, York, some 500 members of the Royal Canadian Air Force stationed around York etched their names while on this mirror on a night off. Many did not live to see the end of the war . The great tea fraud . Adulteration of tea - a then-luxury, expensive drink - was rife for decades. Chemically enhanced tea was bogus leaves boiled with ferrous sulphate, coloured with a palette of Prussian blue, verdigris, tannin, or black carbon before resale; molasses, clay, sulphate of lime or gypsum were also used to bulk up tea and masquerade the fraud. 'Smouch' was particularly noxious: this comprised ash tree leaves dried and soaked in sheep's dung then mixed with a sprinkling of real tea. Some tea contained no tea at all. So pervasive was the practice of counterfeit tea that Parliament passed an Act in 1725 condemning it. Plenty of tea for our men . In the First World War the 12,000 officers and 320,000 men  of the Army Service Corps had the unenviable task of catering for the five million British troops - three million of whom were on the western front alone - on an everyday basis. In 1914 the daily ration included 5/8 oz. (17.7g) of tea, which was plentiful, considering the average tea bag weights about 2g. Other beverages issued were 1/10 gill (14ml) of lime juice and half gill of rum (70ml) at the discretion of the battalion commander - though some of these officers were teetotal and prohibited their men from having any. The Germans, on the other hand, could enjoy 9/10 oz. of coffee, or 1/10 oz. of tea; the commanding officer dispensed 0.17 pint of spirits, 0.44 pint of wine, or 0.88 pint of beer at his discretion. Tea kept us together through WWII . 'Tea is more important than bullets' said Winston Churchill. To the historian A.A. Thompson tea was England's secret weapon, 'what keeps 'em together is tea', 'em' being the armed services and the Women's Institute. Within two days of the declaration of war against Germany, the government requisitioned all tea stocks and dispersed the supplies around the country to spare them from destruction by German bombing. Rationing was introduced in 1940 in response to the German naval blockades: two ounces of tea per person per week for those over the age of five, enough for two or three cups a day of weak tea. Tea causes violent disputes over how it should be made . George Orwell (1903-1950), [A Nice Cup of Tea: Evening Standard, 12th January 1946] was an incurable tea lover with strong views: 'Tea is one of the mainstays of civilisation in this country and causes violent disputes over how it should be made.' Orwell was a strictly no sugar, tea in first man. He goes on to expatiate on his eleven cardinal points regarding the correct way to make a cup of tea.

"A former New York University professor and outspoken advocate for women's empowerment remains behind bars after failing to make $5,000 following her arrest for allegedly stalking and harassing her ex-lover. Dutch economist and educator Heleen Mees, 44, is accused of sending over 1,000 emails to chief Citigroup economist Willem Buiter - a married father of two - over two years. Sexually explicit images were also included, according to police and court documents. However, she remains in prison at Rikers Island after failing to gather the money together yesterday. Dutch economist Heleen Mees leaves Manhattan Criminal Court after attending court proceedings for her stalking case in New York March 10, 2014 . Willem Buiter, married father-of-two and chief economist at Citigroup Inc, was allegedly sent 1,000 emails by Mees over two years . Missives from Mees to the world-renowned economist allegedly contained threats as well as sexually charged language. 'What can I do to make it right? Shall I lick your b***s?' Mees allegedly wrote to her paramour. In another letter cited by The New York Daily News, the 44-year-old ex-adjunct professor at NYU's Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service allegedly suggested that she and Buiter adopt a child. Mees was taken into custody just before noon Monday. Mees' attorney, Vaneshka Hyacinthe, claimed that her client 'had a long-standing relationship' with Buiter and 'the emails go in both directions.' A Manhattan judge ordered the 44-year-old economist to avoid all contact with Mr Buiter and his family. It is believed that the married 63-year-old economist and the Dutch NYU professor once had an intimate relationship, but at some point it ended. 'Hope your plane falls out of the sky,' the embittered Mees wrote to Buiter, according to court documents. Threatened: Mees allegedly sent harassing messages' to Buiter's wife, economics professor Anne Sibert (pictured), and the couple's two children . Buiter, a native of the Netherlands, is married to economics professor Anne Sibert, and the couple have a 22-year-old son and a 19-year-old daughter. Mees, who is fluent in five languages, including Mandarin and French, was assistant professor in economics at Tilburg University and a researcher at the Erasmus School of Economics in the Netherlands. Her area of expertise is monetary policy and emerging economies. It is believed that the brilliant economist and vocal advocate for the advancement of women in the workplace has become obsessed with her distinguished lover. Court papers filed in the case against Mees paint a portrait of an unhinged woman who bombarded Buiter with a slew of increasingly bizarre and disturbing emails between July 1, 2011 and Monday, including one sent May 3 that included an image of dead birds. Mees even dedicated her PhD dissertation to Buiter and thanked him for being 'so kind' to meet with her in the summer of 2008 in London, according to the New York Post. According to the court filings, the 44-year-old alleged stalker also harassed Buiter's wife and children despite her ex-lover's repeated requests that she stop her barrage of messages. On February 27, Mr Buiter sent Mees a cease and desist letter, but that did nothing to deter the lovesick professor, who proceeded to fire off several hundred more emails to him, according to court documents. Willem Buiter has chaired the World Economic Forum and was on the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee. In 2010, he was hired as Citigroup's chief economist. Over the past three decades, Buiter had taught economics at some of the world's most prestigious institutions, including Princeton, Yale and Cambridge universities. His wife currently teaches at University of London's Birkbeck college.","Heleen Mees could not find the $5,000 to make bail yesterday .

"It's like the opening gambit of a bad Hollywood romance. A Brazilian town populated only by women has made an appeal for eligible bachelors. More than 600 women live in the town of Noiva do Cordeiro, south-east Brazil. And most of them are aged between 20 and 35 years old. Now they have extended an invitation to potential suitors. But don't start packing your bags just yet - any men who go have to understand that this corner of the Brazilian countryside is very much a woman's world. Woman's world: This image from Noiva do Cordeiro's Facebook page shows two of the town's residents at a party. They have made an appeal for eligible suitors to woo some of their dozens of available young women . Shangri-La: More than 600 women live in the town of Noiva do Cordeiro, in a rural part of south-east Brazil . Sisters are doing it for themselves: Their husbands and adult sons work away from home all week long . Some of Noiva de Cordeiro's women are already married and have families, but their husbands - and any sons over 18 - are made to work away from home and only allowed to return at the weekends. It means girl power rules in the rural community, with women in charge of every aspect of life - from farming to town planning and even religion. And residents say their town is that much the better for it. 'There are lots of things that women do better than men. Our town is prettier, more organised, and far more harmonious than if men were in charge,' said Rosalee Fernandes, 49. 'When problems or disputes arise, we resolve them in a woman's way, trying to find consensus rather than conflict. 'We share everything, even the land we work on. Nobody competes with anyone here. It's all for one, and one for all. 'The whole town came together recently to help buy a huge widescreen TV for our community centre so we can all watch soap operas together. 'And there's always time to stop and gossip, try on each other's clothes and do each other's hair and nails.' Farmer Joan: Women are in charge of every aspect of life in the town, from farming to town planning . 'There's always time to stop and gossip': The town's residents say life there is much better without men . But while none of the residents of Noiva do Cordeiro would have it any other way, it has left them with just one problem. Nelma Fernandes, 23, admits it's impossible for her neighbours - renowned in the region as strikingly beautiful - to find a would-be spouse. 'Here, the only men we single girls meet are either married or related to us, everyone is a cousin. I haven't kissed a man for a long time,' she said. 'We all dream of falling in love and getting married. But we like living here and don't want to have to leave the town to find a husband.' 'We all dream of falling in love': However their rules have made it difficult for single women to find husbands . 'But men need to live according to our rules': And the women of Noiva do Cordeiro aren't interested in leaving . The lack of eligible batchelors has now led the community's many single young ladies for make an appeal for interested men - but only those willing to adapt to living in a women's world. Ms Fernandes said: 'We'd like to get to know men who would leave their own lives and come to be a part of ours. 'But first they need to agree to do what we say and live according to our rules.' Noiva do Cordeiro was born in the hills near Belo Vale, in Minas Gerais state, after founder Maria Senhorinha de Lima was branded an adulterer after leaving a man she had been forced to marry. She was chased out of town in 1891 after the Catholic church excommunicated her and the next five generations of her family when she shacked up with another suitor. Shunned by the local population, she and other women who subsequently went to live with them were vilified as loose women and prostitutes, causing them to isolate themselves from the outside world. Free: The women of Noiva do Cordeiro have dispensed with patriarchal Christianity, with one saying 'We don't need to go to church, get married in front of a priest or baptise our children. These are rules made up by men . In 1940, an evangelical pastor, Anisio Pereira, took one of the women, aged 16, to be his wife and founded a church in the growing community. However, he proceeded to impose strict puritanical rules, banning them from drinking alcohol, listening to music, cutting their hair or using any type of contraceptive. When Anisio died in 1995, the women decided never again to let a man dictate how they should live. And one of the first things they did was to dismantle the male-biased organised religion he had set up. Rosalee Fernandes said: 'We have God in our hearts. But we don't think we need to go to church, get married in front of a priest or baptise our children. These are rules made up by men.'","Noiva do Cordeiro is home to more than 600 women, most of them under 35 .
Some are already married but their husbands must live and work elsewhere .
But that means there is a shortage of eligible suitors to woo young women ."

The creature captured the hearts of people from around the world when he cried as he was freed from chains after 50 years, and was taken to join five female elephants at Wildlife SOS's Elephant Conservation and Care Centre in India.

Raju, the elephant who wept after being released from chains is facing more misery - after his owners have launched a legal battle to win him back . Charity Wildlife SOS founder Kartick Satyanarayan, who led the rescue operation to save Raju, said: 'We are devastated that after all he’s been though we are still having to fight for Raju’s freedom. His owner is arguing that Raju is his property, which must be returned to him for his use. 'We are hoping the courts will see sense that this can never happen as Raju was treated with such appalling cruelty and torture in his hands in the first place and the man claiming ownership of Raju has no legal grounds to claim him back under Indian law. 'The thought of him being forced to go back to a life in chains is just horrific. 'We are starting a Raju Legal fund that will help us fight such legal battles to protect Raju and elephants like him that suffer in silence. One of Raju’s friends Laxmi Elephant who was rescued by Wildlife SOS from Mumbai suffers a similar fate where her previous owner is claiming her back as property.'

Mr Satyanarayan added: 'We are planning to fight tooth and nail through the courts to ensure this can’t happen. We will take it to the highest legal levels and to the Supreme Court of India if required. 'We will argue that he broke wildlife protection laws and animal cruelty laws through his treatment of Raju, and that he was being kept illegally After being trafficked from handler to handler from being poached as a calf. 'We want this case to set a precedent across India to change the way elephants are treated and abusers are punished and justice prevails for these magnificent creatures that suffer in silence.' Raju’s story first came to light in July this year when the Harrow-based charity Wildlife SOS-UK along with their counterparts, Wildlife SOS India, rescued him in a daring midnight operation in India. A ten-strong team of vets and wildlife experts from the charity Wildlife SOS along with 20 Forest Department and Police officers seized Raju in the Uttar Pradesh region. Kartick said: 'He'd been poached as a calf from the wild; Poachers either slaughter the mother, or they drive the herd into traps that are small enough only for the babies to fall into. The mother cries for her baby for days after he's been stolen – the illegal elephant trade is sickening. The calves are then tied and beaten until they submit to their captors – their spirits are effectively broken. 'Raju's case was particularly tragic as we believe he has been sold again and again and might have had 27 owners – he's been treated as a commodity and beaten into accepting his new handler every two years of his life. 'By the time we found him he was in a pathetic condition. He hadn't been fed properly and tourists started giving him sweet food items and because he was in a state of hunger and exhaustion he began eating plastic and paper He had no shelter at night, and was being used as a prop to beg with from dawn until dusk or being used for giving tourists joy rides. And most heartrendingly of all – the chains that cut into his legs had been there for 50 years. It was horrific. 'It took us 45 minutes to remove the shackles that had torn into the flesh on his legs for the past 50 years – an act of unthinkable cruelty. Raju's story first came to light in July this year when the Harrow-based charity Wildlife SOS-UK along with their counterparts, Wildlife SOS India, rescued him in a daring midnight operation in India . 'His legs were so covered in abscesses and his feet so damaged by walking on hard tarmac roads, that we have spent much more than expected on his medical treatment, and we still have a long way to go as he has a serious limp and open wounds.' Raju arrived at Wildlife SOS’s Elephant Conservation and Care Center, in Mathura, India, two months ago, where he joined five female elephants. Mr Satyanarayan said: 'We are delighted Raju has fitted in so well with the first family he's ever had since he was orphaned by poachers as a calf. The creature captured the hearts of people from around the world when he cried as he was freed from chains after 50 years . Raju still faces years of treatment to heal both the physical and psychological wounds from his time in chains . 'He had been so terribly brutalized for 50 years that we feared he’d be unable to live with his own kind. He didn’t even know how to be an elephant. But now it’s like he’s always been with them. When we first released him, he held back and he was clearly wary. Three of our female elephants Laxmi, Chanchal and Sai Geeta (also known as Bijli) ran up to him – their ears flapping wildly –a sign they were excited and delighted to meet him. They also made high-pitched trumpeting sounds – a greeting. Then each of them touched him with their trunks, clearly reassuring him before they wandered off into the grazing land. It was incredibly touching after all he’d been through. 'Raju still faces years of treatment to heal both the physical and psychological wounds. 'The thought that he may have to leave all this behind if his owner gets his way – is absolutely heartbreaking for us and for the other elephants. 'All we want is for him to taste freedom for the first time in their lives and live out his days in dignity, free from suffering and pain and we are determined to make that happen.'","The creature captured the hearts of people from around the world when he cried as he was freed from chains after 50 years .

"At first glance, Frankie is just an ordinary everyday pug. Pudgy face, cute skin rolls and a breathless little grunt that makes him all the more adorable. But then nature calls. Frankie is the star of a new video in which he takes going for a wee to the next level.

He stands to pee: Frankie the pug dog goes to the toilet in a particularly acrobatic matter, on his two front paws . In the video, Frankie stays on his front paws for no less than 67 seconds while keeping  a steady stream flowing. He walks around the concrete yard, anything but camera shy as his owner films. Paw-stand peeing is nothing new for pugs, one of the quirks of the beloved breed from from China to Europe in the 16th century, but few are as impressive as Frankie. 'His owner says no one taught him how to do it and that it has been a habit with him since he was a pup,' says the YouTube post. 'While she and her children are used to seeing it, Frankie's peeing technique never fails to put a smile on the face of bystanders every time they take him for a walk.'

"Human remains are being used in secretive weapons tests funded by the sale of Remembrance Sunday poppies. Legs, feet and possibly other body parts are being imported from America and destroyed in the gruesome experiments, paid for by £5 million from Royal British Legion coffers. The controversial tests have been conducted for four years – and now take place at a laboratory officially opened by Prince Harry last year. Scroll for video . The test centre at Imperial College, London, was official opened by Prince Harry last year . Body parts are being imported from America and destroyed in the experiments - paid for by the sale of Remembrance Sunday popppies . Tests at the Royal British Legion Centre for Blast Injury Studies are intended to lead to improvements in military equipment and help troops injured in Afghanistan . However the use of imported limbs has been kept secret until now. The Mail on Sunday has established that limbs are regularly transported to the test centre at Imperial College, Central London, but both the Royal British Legion (RBL) and the university refused to answer key questions including: . - Whether donors or their loved ones agreed specifically for the body parts to be used in military tests. - How many, and what particular, body parts have been used. - Who supplies the human remains and at what price. Last night, Shadow Universities Minister Liam Byrne said he would demand answers in Parliament about where the imported body parts came from. He said: ‘This is vital research but it has got to be conducted to world-class standards. That means proper transparency so the public know what they’re funding. Our soldiers need the world’s best protection and the world’s best treatment.’ Tests conducted at the Royal British Legion Centre for Blast Injury Studies (CBIS) are intended to lead to improvements in military equipment. The limbs are used to assess the impact of weapons such as the improvised explosive devices which have killed and wounded hundreds of UK troops in Afghanistan. Professor Anthony Bull (pictured) heads the blast injury unit at Imperial College in London . Prince Harry officially opened the centre last year after the RBL – which hopes to raise £40million from the Poppy Appeal – donated £5 million, with Imperial College committing another £3 million. The research is conducted by 30 military and civilian experts in bio-engineering and bio-mechanics. In the UK the use of body parts in research is strictly regulated by the Human Tissue Authority. The law says that remains sourced in Britain must come with the full consent of donors or their loved ones that they can be used in scientific research. But the code of practice states no such consent need be obtained if the material has been imported – saying only that it is ‘good practice to ensure mechanisms are in place in the source country for obtaining consent’. Although Imperial College says it abides by all regulations on consent and ethical requirements, the university has refused to declare where its body parts come from. It has admitted some remains are sourced from US companies but will not name the suppliers – making it impossible for this newspaper to establish whether donors were made aware that their body parts would be used in military tests. Last night US donor expert Chris Truitt, who campaigns for improved rights for those who donate body parts, said: ‘Many families in America would be horrified to know that entire body parts were being sent to the UK to be blown up in a lab. ‘It is the fact that families don’t know that makes it horrific. In the US families just sign off on tissue donation for research purposes but have no idea what actually happens to their loved ones’ remains.’ Imperial College has said it abides by all regulations on consent and ethical requirements, but the university has refused to declare where its body parts come from . The centre’s website states that it uses ‘human tissue’ in experiments but only when pressed did a spokesman explain that body parts were used, some of which are imported. As a result of The Mail on Sunday’s investigation, MPs on the House of Commons Health Select Committee are to probe the conduct of the centre. Committee member Barbara Keeley MP said: ‘I shall be asking questions about what can be done to ensure transparency about practices at this centre.’ An Imperial College spokesman said: ‘It is not relevant whether tissue used comes from donors in the UK, Europe or the US as long as all regulatory, consent and ethical requirements are met. All human tissue used in the course of the research has been donated to medical science with full informed consent by either the donor or their relatives.’ A Royal British Legion spokesman said the centre ‘exists to improve and advance treatment, rehabilitation and recovery after blast injury.’ He confirmed that the charity had granted £5 million to fund the centre for six years, and would review the situation after that. The Ministry of Defence and the Department of Health declined to comment. A research department at Imperial College has agreed to source body parts from a US company linked to the illegal trade in human remains in Eastern Europe. RTI Surgical will supply human tendons to scientists working on ways to improve surgical treatment for patients with joint injuries. Imperial College and the Royal British Legion insisted this project has nothing to do with the tests conducted at the Centre for Blast Injury Studies. In 2012, it was claimed that RTI Surgical was sourcing tissue from morgues in Ukraine where documents relating to the deceased were forged. In one morgue investigators found dozens of corpses stripped of all their reusable parts; while authorities intercepted a minibus crammed with bones and tissue believed to be heading for a factory ultimately owned by Florida-based RTI, one of the world’s leading suppliers of body parts. Last night the company confirmed it ceased all operations in Ukraine following the reports, adding that it complies with relevant laws regarding consent wherever it operates.","Body parts are being imported and destroyed in gruesome experiments .

"When Frenchman Emile Leray became stranded in a Moroccan desert with a badly damaged car, his ordeal was one which would have left most men helpless and desperate. But after his Citroen car ground to a halt, the enterprising electrician would not be denied in his quest to find his way back to civilisation. His amazing escape from the barren terrain saw Mr Leray singlehandedly rebuild his Citreon into a makeshift motorbike, in a dramatic escape which has seen him dubbed the most 'extreme' mechanic in the world. Stranded: Mr Leray had found himself 20 miles from the nearest village, but slept under his car's body while converting the rest of the vehicle into a motorbike . Finished product: His amazing makeshift motorbike made from the car's remaining parts allowed Mr Leray to travel to civilisation, where he was rescued by police . His ingenious engineering saw him convert the car's rear bumper into a rudimentary seat, shorten the chassis, and place the engine and gearbox in the middle to create a vehicle which somehow kept going long enough to transport him to safety. The 43-year-old had been driving his Citroen 2CV across the desert from the Moroccan city of Tan-Tan. However, along the way he was stopped at a military outpost and was informed that he couldn't go any further. Faced with prospect of returning to Tan Tan, Emile decided instead to go off road to navigate around the restricted area. Unfortunately the rocky and bumpy terrain soon caused problems and he lost control of his car before crashing into a rock. The impact caused the Citroen's swing arm and wheel axle to snap - leaving the car undriveable. Preserved: Mr Leray, now 62, has kept the motorbike as a memento of his incredible escape from the Moroccan desert . With the nearest village at least 20 miles away, Emile didn't feel he would be able to make it on foot. Luckily, he had a small cache of supplies, water for several days and a few tools, including a hacksaw. After considering his options, Emile decided that his best course of action was to use parts from his car to create a makeshift motorbike. Mr Leray told the Sunday Times: 'I wanted to do it off road because I had travelled round Africa about 10 times, so I knew the region well and therefore had no concerns. 'I decided to do it in a 2CV because, although it is not a 4x4, it is tough. In Africa they call it the ‘Steel Camel’ because it goes everywhere — provided you drive it gently. One must not be rough. 'I obviously was too rough because I broke it. 'I could not have gone back on foot — it was too far. I put myself in what one calls survival mode. I ate less; I monitored my supplies of water and of food to make them last as long as possible.' He started by removing the Citroen's body, which he then used as a shelter to sleep under. To build the bike he shortened the car's chassis before reattaching the axles and two of the wheels, as well as installing the engine and gearbox in the middle. He had thought that it would take him just a few days to construct the motorcycle, but in the end it took 12. Recovery: Mr Leray's amazing extreme mechanic story happened in 1993, but has only just come to light . Heroic deeds: Mr Leray's exploits have seen him compared to Tony Stark, the character in Iron Man (played by Robert Downey Jr), who was known for his ingenious engineering ability . Eventually, however, it was complete and, with just half a litre of water left, Emile started his ride back to civilisation. The going was easy and he regularly fell off the seat, which was made from part of the car's rear bumper. After a day of riding Emile was picked up by the Moroccan police who drove him to the nearest village. They also handed him a hefty fine because the registration documents for his car no longer corresponded to what he was driving. Emile's extraordinary tale has only just come to light after appearing on the internet and quickly going viral. Although his story appeared in brief on French television in the 1990s, Mr Leray did not publicise his exploits, and they only recently emerged again after appearing on a motoring website. Mr Leray, now 62 and living in northwest France, has been likened to action hero Tony Stark and his superhero Iron Man, who was known for his ingenious engineering ability.","Emile Leray broke Citroen in Moroccan desert 20 miles from nearest village .

"Norwegian businesswoman Marte Deborah Dalelv, 24, has been sentenced to 16 months in prison for extramarital sex after she reported being raped . The identity of the Norwegian . woman who was sentenced to 16 months in prison for . extramarital sex after she reported being . raped in Dubai has been revealed for the first time today. Smiling happily into the camera, Marte Deborah Dalelv looks like she doesn't have a care in the world. But the 24-year-old was brutally raped while on a business trip in United Arab Emirates and was handed a prison sentence for having sex outside of marriage after reporting it to police. Ms Dalelv . reported the sexual assault in March this year, after which she had to . spend days in a cell before she was allowed to use a telephone. With . the help of family members, the Norwegian consulate was able to . negotiate a release and she has been living under the protection of the . Norwegian Sailor’s Church until her sentencing this week. 'I . received the harshest sentence for sex outside marriage, harshest . sentence for drinking alcohol and on top of that I was found guilty of . perjury,’ she told Verdens Gang. ‘It is a terrible situation she is in,’ said Gisle Meling, the priest at the Norwegian Sailor’s Church. ‘We . are very surprised and had hoped it would go another way, but we live . in a country which has a justice system which draws its conclusions with . the help of Sharia law.’ Ms Dalelv was sentenced to one year and four months in jail but as Norway has no extradition treaty with Dubai, her future is uncertain. Waiting game: Marte Deborah Dalelv, pictured in Dubai, faces an uncertain future as Norway doesn't have an extradition treaty with Dubai . The young Norwegian woman's story is not unique. Earlier . this year Australian Alicia Gali, 27, spoke of how she was thrown in a . Dubai jail for eight months after she reported a rape. Miss Gali was working at hotel chain Starwood when her drink was spiked in the staff bar. She . awoke to find that three colleagues had raped her, but when she went to . a hospital for help, they turned her over to the police and she was . charged with illicit sex outside marriage. Under . UAE law, rapists can only be convicted if either the perpetrator . confesses or if four adult Muslim males witness the crime. Under . the Sharia-influenced laws, sex before marriage is completely forbidden . and an unmarried couple holding hands in public can be jailed. Foreigners jailed in Dubai are deported immediately after completing their sentences.

"She claimed that she was powerless as John F Kennedy took advantage of her. But now the former White House intern who had an 18-month affair with the ex-president has revealed that she actually wanted to have sex with him. Mimi Alford said that when Mr Kennedy took her virginity in his wife’s bed in the summer of 1962 she was ‘willing to do it.' Scroll down for video . Broken lips: Mimi Alford kept her secret affair with the former U.S. president safe for years before deciding to write a tell-all book about their time together . At the White House swimming pool, JFK asked Mimi (pictured): 'Mind if I join you?' She described him as 'remarkably fit - flat stomach, toned arms - for a 45-year-old man. After sliding into the pool, he floated up to me' Far from being repulsed by his advances, the former church worker also admitted that she found him ‘unbelievably handsome’. Miss Alford’s disclosure undercuts her suggestion that Mr Kennedy took advantage of her and used her for sex during their initial liaison. Extracts from her memoir have detailed how she was shocked when on her fifth day as a White House press aide he led her away from co-workers who were having cocktails down the hall to his wife’s bedroom where they had sex for the first time. Aged 19 at the time, she writes that ‘short of screaming’ there was nothing she could do to get Mr Kennedy off her. Taken: Mimi claims that President Kennedy, seen here with his wife Jacqueline, took the young intern to his wife's room in the White House where she lost her virginity to him . But in an interview with NBC, Miss Alford said that she actually meant ‘overpowered in the sense that he was the president.' Speaking to Today she said: ‘He was this unbelievably handsome man who was 45-years-old. ‘Not . overpowered physically as in somebody grabbed me and made me do . something that I wasn't really willing to do, because I really think I . was willing to do it.' Miss Alford added that the first time she met the President the day before at the White House pool, during which time he eyed her up, felt perfectly normal too. She said: ‘It really didn’t feel unnatural because everybody was friendly because everybody went back to work afterwards.’ 'Even in our most intimate moments, I called him Mr President. To do otherwise would have seemed inappropriate' Comfortable: Miss Alford says that her exclusive meetings with the president and his most-trusted staff members felt natural because of how friendly and seemingly open they were . Miss Alford was first ‘outed’ in 2003 in a biography of Mr Kennedy but she has kept quiet until now. Asked why she now decided to write her memoirs, she said: ‘Most mornings I thought: ‘I don’t want to get up and write this book’. ‘Then I thought: ‘Why keep a secret? Why keep silent about something? You do something because you think it’s keeping you safe, but in fact it’s deadly.' In the book, ‘Once Upon a Secret: My Affair with President John F. Kennedy and Its Aftermath,' Miss Alford writes how she went from being a debutante from a prominent New Jersey family to a White House press aide - and into the president’s bed. Handsome: She called him unbelievably handsome helping advance her enthusiasm as a White House press aide to a usual member of his entourage and then, a partner in his bed . Her lurid claims include allegations that he once made her inhale a sex drug at a debauched party at Bing Crosby’s desert ranch. 'The president asked me if I wanted to try the drug, which stimulated the heart but also purportedly enhanced sex. 'I . said no, but he just went ahead and popped the capsule and held it . under my nose. He didn’t try it himself. This was a new sensation, and . it frightened me. I panicked and ran crying from the room,' she writes in her autobiography. On another occasion he coerced her into performing a sex act on an aide while he looked on. When she thought she was pregnant that same aide arranged for her to see an abortion doctor, even though abortion was illegal at the time. Encounters: She found the president unbelievably handsome, in her words, and was both happy and comfortable when she met staff for a swim in the White House pool and he showed up, giving her a look up and down . It turned out to be a false alarm. Miss Alford, now a 69-year-old grandmother living in New York, also writes in her autobiography that through their affair she never called Mr Kennedy by his first name ‘Jack’ and always called him ‘Mr President,' even when they were in bed together. Miss Alford, who ironically went to the . same Miss Porter's school as JFK's wife Jackie, described Kennedy as . 'playful', the sex as 'varied and fun' and said he could be 'seductive . and playful'. She said they . spent a lot of time 'taking baths' and that if they spent the night . together, she would wear his own soft-blue cotton nightshirts. But . she also revealed complications in the relationship, saying they never . kissed, and that she was often subjected to a 'waiting game' where she . was told to stay in her hotel until he called for her. Personal stories: Mr Kennedy reached out to Miss Alford following the death of his infant son Patrick Bouvier Kennedy with his wife Jacqueline (pictured), whom he shared received letters of remorse with . 'Best friends': Dave Powers, pictured with JFK . in 1963, and alone in the Cabinet Room in 1962. The new book claims the . former President 'dared' Miss Alford to perform sex acts on Mr Powers while . he watched . In a different direction for their affairs, Miss Alford also writes of the president asking her to . 'take care' of his friend, staff member Dave Powers, who 'looked a little tense' in his description while . they were swimming in the White House pool. Published: Miss Alford's new book, Once Upon a Secret: My Affair with President John F. Kennedy and Its Aftermath, provides a never-before told story of life in the White House with the president as his mistress . 'It . was a dare, but I knew exactly what he meant. This was a challenge to . give Dave Powers oral sex. I don’t think the president thought I’d do . it, but I’m ashamed to say that I did... The president silently . watched,' she wrote. During the October 1962 Cuban Missile . Crisis, where the U.S. and USSR had a nuclear stand-off, he reportedly . told her that: 'I’d rather my children red than dead.' In another, more personal moment when her lover reached out to her following the death of his infant son . Patrick Bouvier Kennedy, she wrote of their time together seated on a White House balcony while he quietly wept. She wrote: 'I had never seen real . grief in my relatively short life. He invited me upstairs, and we sat . outside on the balcony in the soft summer evening air. There was a stack . of condolence letters on the floor next to his chair, and he picked . each one up and read it aloud to me... Occasionally, tears rolling down . his cheeks, he would write something on one of the letters, probably . notes for a reply. But mostly he just read them and cried. I did, too.' Miss Alford . said she saw President Kennedy for the final time at The Carlyle hotel . in Manhattan on November 15, 1963, just a week before his assassination . in Dallas. At this point she was due to be married to her college sweetheart, Tony Fahnestock. 'He . took me in his arms for a long embrace and said, 'I wish you were . coming with me to Texas.' And then he added, 'I'll call you when I get . back.' I was overcome with sudden sadness. 'Remember, Mr President, I’m . getting married.' ''I know that,' he said, and shrugged. 'But I’ll call you anyway.'' Watch the video here: .

"A stellar ‘caterpillar’ in the midst of a metamorphosis has been spotted by astronomers. The light-year-long cosmic squiggle is currently collecting material from an envelope of gas surrounding it. Astronomers are now keen to see what will emerge from the protostar, which is in a very early evolutionary stage. Scroll down for video... This light-year-long knot of interstellar gas and dust resembles a caterpillar on its way to a feast. Harsh winds from extremely bright stars are blasting ultraviolet radiation at this 'wanna-be' star and sculpting the gas and dust into its long shape . A previous study has called the object, which lies 4,500 light-years away in the constellation Cygnus, a ‘tadpole in an interstellar pond.’ Harsh winds from extremely bright stars are blasting ultraviolet radiation at this 'wanna-be' star, named IRAS 20324+4057, and sculpting the gas and dust into its long shape. The culprits are 65 of the hottest, brightest known stars, classified as O-type stars, located 15 light-years away from the knot, towards the right edge of the image. VIDEO: The 'cosmic caterpillar' zoom sequence . Cygnus OB2 (pictured) is home to some of the largest and most luminous stars known. Astronomers believe that the envelope of gas surrounding the protostar is being eroded by the radiation from Cygnus OB2 . Object name:    IRAS 20324+4057 . Object description:    Protostar in early evolutionary stage . Constellation:    Cygnus . Distance:    4,500 light-years away . This image is based on data gathered by the Advanced Camera for Surveys in . 2006. It also combines data . from ground-based hydrogen data collected by the Isaac Newton Telescope. These stars, along with 500 highly luminous B-type stars, make up what is called the Cygnus OB2 association. However, astronomers believe that the envelope of gas surrounding the protostar is being eroded by the radiation from Cygnus OB2. Protostars in this region should eventually become young stars with final masses about one to ten times that of our sun. If the eroding radiation from the nearby bright stars destroys the gas envelope before the protostars finish collecting mass, their final masses could be cut. A previous study has called the object, which lies 4,500 light-years away in the constellation Cygnus, a 'tadpole in an interstellar pond' According to spectroscopic observations of the central star within IRAS 20324+4057, the protostar is still collecting material quite heavily from its outer envelope, hoping to bulk up in mass. What will emerge from this metamorphosis remains to be seen. ‘Only time will tell if the formed star will be a “heavyweight” or a “lightweight” with respect to its mass,’ said the Hubble team. This image, released this week the Hubble’s Space Telescope Science Institute, is based on data in green and infrared wavelengths gathered by the Advanced Camera for Surveys in 2006. It also combines data from ground-based hydrogen data collected by the Isaac Newton Telescope in 2003 as part of the IPHAS H-alpha survey.","The protostar is located 4,500 light-years away in the constellation Cygnus .

"Cardinal Sin: A new piece by artist Banksy on display at the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool . A sculpture of a 'vandalised' priest by the underground artist Banksy has gone on display today alongside 17th-century Old Masters. The artist, known for his graffiti on the streets of cities across the world, has created Cardinal Sin, a replica of an 18th-century stone bust which has had the face sawn off and replaced with a mosaic of bathroom tiles. The effect is to replicate the pixellation techniques used in the media to prevent identification of victims of sex crimes. It is believed Cardinal Sin is a comment on the sexual abuse scandal which has engulfed the Catholic Church. The sculpture has been placed alongside works by Van Dyck and Poussin at the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool. The Walker unveiled the priest sculpture to the public today after it was given on indefinite loan by the artist. It has never been seen in public before. In a statement issued by the gallery on behalf of the mysterious artist, Banksy said: 'I love everything about the Walker Gallery - the Old Masters, the contemporary art, the rude girl in the cafe. 'And when I found out Mr Walker built it with beer money, it became my favourite gallery. 'The statue? I guess you could call it a Christmas present. 'At this time of year it’s easy to forget the true meaning of Christianity - the lies, the corruption, the abuse.' Reyahn King, director of art . galleries at National Museums Liverpool, said the Walker was 'thrilled' to display the work of a 'major contemporary artist'. Admirers: Visitors at the Walker Art Gallery admire the newest piece of artwork from the controversial contemporary artist . Attention grabbing: ate: Banksy has sawn off the face of an 18th century stone bust and glued on a selection of bathroom tiles for his latest piece - which was being photographed today . 'It’s a huge coup and we are sure his work will spark a reaction with visitors.' The sculpture has been placed in the Walker’s 17th Century Old Masters gallery. Ms King said: 'Banksy specified that it be shown alongside our period collection and we were very happy to oblige.' Elsewhere in the city, a new work of graffiti by Banksy has been vandalised. A stencilled bi-plane, which appeared last week on the side wall of an office block, was daubed overnight with 'BANKSY FOR ROBBO' in red spray paint. Controversial meaning: The piece is thought to be a comment on the abuse scandal in the church and its subsequent cover-up, the gallery said in a press release . Best known work: Banksy is famed for his graffiti street art, such as this scene seen in New York City .","Cardinal Sin is a replica of an 18th-century stone bust with the face sawn off and replaced with 'pixellated' tiles .

"From lava lamps to electric candelabras, lights come in many shapes and sizes and now one designer has created a concept lamp that can be blown up like a balloon. The inflatable LED lighting called BLOW appears to float, can be made up to 33ft (10 metres) long and is able to be folded so it is easily stored. The lights can be inflated by blowing into a valve at one end of a polyethylene tube, which is forced closed when the air pressure inside the tube is at the right level. The inflatable LED lighting called BLOW (pictured) appears to float, can be made up to 33ft (10metres) long and folded up so it is easily stored . When this happens, the balloon is illuminated and light from the LED stripe reflects off the aluminium coating inside the creation. The design was created by Theo Möller while he was studying at the Burg Giebichenstein University of Art and Design in Halle, Germany and has just gone on show at Milan’s design week. ‘The flexible LED stripe fits into a thin tunnel on the translucent bottom foil of the lamp. That means that you can separate the components and do not have the trouble with safety certificates,’ he told Dezeen. The tubes are made from sheets of aluminium-coated polyethylene and are ‘welded’ together.

The system can be used to create different shapes and sizes of lights such as a vertical strip (pictured left) and a square design (right) He originally selected the materials from which to construct a new type of light as he envisaged it flying and was using lightweight emergency blankets as a reflector. While they sparked the idea, the original prototypes did not keep the air inside the tubes so Mr Möller selected a different kind of foil. ‘Polyethylene barrier film with aluminium coating made the lamp staple and airtight,’ he said. He has now created tubes in different lengths with some measuring four metres, which weigh just 1.3lbs (600 grams) each. The lights can be inflated by blowing into a valve at one end of a polyethylene tube, which is forced closed when the air pressure inside the tube is at the right level . They can be attached to minimalistic metal stands using hidden magnets inside the lights or with nylon threads that can also be used to hang the lights from a ceiling, causing them to ‘hover’ in mid-air. When the novelty of the inflatable lighting has worn off, the lights can be deflated by inserting a straw into the valve and can be folded up and stored in a small space. Mr Möller plans on developing different shapes and sizes of the BLOW light as well as manufacturing his designs for a low cost.

"A woman accused of arranging to send £16,000 to her husband fighting in Syria concealed in her friend's underwear is 'foul-mouthed' and a 'phone-addicted, weed-smoking kaffir' and an unlikely terrorist, her barrister has told a court. Amal El-Wahabi, 27, of north west London, allegedly asked her friend Nawal Msaad, also 27, to be a trusted courier and take the cash to Turkey at the request of Aine Davis, known by his Muslim name Hamza. But Msaad, of Holloway, north London, was stopped by police at Heathrow in January before she boarded a flight. She handed over the rolled up notes hidden in her undergarments, the Old Bailey heard. 'A foul-mouthed, red-haired, talkaholic, opinionated, phone-addicted, weed-smoking kaffir': A lawyer's description of his client Amal El-Wahabi (left) , who is accused of funding terrorism after arranging to send £16,000 to her husband fighting in Syria concealed in the underwear of her friend, Nawal Msaad (right) Delivering his closing speech today, El-Wahabi's barrister Mark Summers described his client to jurors. 'A more unlikely terrorist you may never have seen in this court,' he said. 'Just picture this - Amal, that foul-mouthed, red-haired, talkaholic, opinionated, phone-addicted, weed-smoking kaffir playing the dutiful Burka-clad (woman) cooking around the camp fire in Syria. 'If a jury in this court in its 200 years has been invited to swallow a more preposterous proposition, I personally would have paid good money to see it.' El-Wahabi put her hand over her mouth as she laughed at his comments from the dock. Mr Summers went on: 'Added to these unsuitable jihadist personality traits is selfishness. Everything that Amal says and does is about her. She wouldn't even attend a charity event if she couldn't get in free.' Courier: Msaad was stopped by police at Heathrow in January before she boarded a flight. She handed over the rolled up notes hidden in her undergarments, the Old Bailey (pictured) heard. He also said that Hamza, 30, who the court previously heard was a drug dealer who was regularly in trouble with police, was involved in 'drugs, drugs and more drugs'. Mr Summers told the jury of five men and seven women it would need to answer two questions as it deliberated its verdicts, the first being whether Hamza is a terrorist. 'If you're not sure that he's a terrorist, then it follows that you can't be sure that the money was for terrorism,' he said. 'Two: even if you answer question one in the affirmative you also have to be sure that Amal knew he was a terrorist. If she did not then it follows that she could not have believed that the money was for terrorism. 'Even if Davis (AKA Hamza) was a terrorist and Amal knew it, it still does not inevitably follow that terrorism was the target for the money.' Mr Summers said El-Wahabi 'clearly was intending' to take her two young children to live in Turkey and that was what the money was to go towards. 'That's what she was telling people at the time,' he said. 'She hasn't made it up - it's there in her messages.' El-Wahabi and Msaad both deny a charge of funding terrorism.

"Vow: Prince William is on a mission to clamp down on the brutal murder of elephants, rhinos and tigers for ivory . Prince William has vowed to destroy all 1,200 ivory artefacts in Buckingham Palace to 'send a message' to illegal elephant poachers. The priceless collection includes a throne from India that belonged to Queen Victoria, as well as fans, tankards, statuettes, and furniture. But sources close to the prince say he feels strongly about putting 'his money where his mouth is'. If successful, he will go on to urge other heads of state to follow suit. A long-term supporter of animal rights charities, the Duke of Cambridge makes regular speeches imploring world leaders to adopt a 'zero tolerance' policy towards illegal poaching in the lucrative trade. On Thursday, he joined his father Prince Charles to a summit in London urging industry members to 'follow the money' to chase the brutal gangs, just days after the pair released a multi-lingual appeal for people to condemn illegal poaching across the world. At home in Clarence House, William is said to have ordered for all ivory items to be hidden from sight for years. Speaking at a conference last year, the . second in line to the throne said: 'The forces that are currently . destroying some of the world's most endangered species are sophisticated . and powerful, but this week we are seeing the creation of an equally . powerful alliance, coming together to help fight them.' The royal collection now under threat mainly consists of gifts handed to the Queen by leaders across the world. Palace sources insist they were all acquired 'in full knowledge of relevant legislation'. Scroll down for video . Family affair: He has been working for years with his brother Prince Harry and father Prince Charles to fight the trade . Princes William and Harry have been over to Africa to survey the stockpiles of elephant tusks (pictured) and have been campaigning against poaching . The three appeared at the Illegal Wildlife Trade Conference in London on Thursday to address the matter . However, experts have hailed the suggestion as a powerful move that will have significant impact. 'It's difficult to imagine a stronger . symbol of the horrors of ivory than Buckingham Palace publicly . destroying its own,' Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith told the Independent . on Sunday. 'Good for Prince William for pushing this.' However, the move, the latest in a . number of bids by the prince to protect elephants, has sparked outrage . in the art world as experts claim destroying works 'of the highest . order' is 'menacing'. Royal collection: There are over 1,200 items in the Royal Collection which are listed as containing ivory, including this throne and footstool which comes from India and dates to 1850 . Destroyed: This ornately carved cup and lid, and this sword hilt, which both feature in the Royal Collection, would both be ground to dust under plans from Prince William . This ivory cockade fan was made in 1790 for the then-Prince of Wales, and later King George IV . The royal collection mainly consists of gifts handed to the Queen by leaders across the world. Brian Sewell, art critic and elephant-protection supporter, told the Independent on Sunday: 'We have to recognise that [these items] exist. 'Ivory was a treasured material that was worked on by craftsmen of the highest order during the Renaissance... It's pointless. 'I can't see the connection between saving elephants and destroying works of art made centuries ago.'","Duke of Cambridge hailed by animal rights activists and urges world leaders to follow suit in bid to adopt 'zero tolerance' policy of illegal poaching .

"Images of Rosie Huntington-Whiteley gyrating in her underwear were designed to improve sales of her lingerie range at Marks & Spencer. However, the moving video posters left little to the imagination and drew complaints that they were overtly sexual, explicit and even degrading to women. But the Advertising Standards Agency has today dismissed those complaints ruling that the advert was not too raunchy and designed to show the range off 'in the best possible light'. Controversial: Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is pictured posing in floral underwear for the M&S advert. The advert drew complaints  which have since been dismissed by the Advertising Standards Agency . 'Not overtly sexy': The model was promoting the range that she designed for the high street giant . The 25-year-old British model and actress has been proven to have something of the Midas touch for brands she is associated with, including M&S and Burberry. Certainly, her lingerie range has been one of the few success stories at M&S, which has gone through troubled times in recent months. The first video poster showed her in a green bra and knickers, turning as if posing in front of a mirror, while the second involved similar poses in a purple bra and knickers. The third, in which she wore a flowered pattern lingerie set, was the most risqué in that she was seen turning and showing her bare back and much of her bottom. Some people who saw the advertisements felt they were overtly sexual and unsuitable to be seen by children, while a number complained that they reinforced sexual stereotypes of women. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has issued a ruling today rejecting a total of seven complaints and clearing the video posters to run again. Tasteful: Rosie Huntington-Whiteley poses in the M&S advert, left, and at the official launch of her M&S collection in London last August, right . Sales boost: The high street giant said that the adverts were designed to be 'soft' and 'sophisticated' The watchdog said it accepted that some people would find the nudity in the ads distasteful, however it said the images were not likely to cause serious or widespread offence. In its defence, M&S said it had ensured the video posters were not displayed near schools, while the images were deliberately designed to be ‘filmic’, ‘sophisticated’ and ‘soft’. The chain said the approach had been very successful, while the intention was to appeal to women ‘as opposed to being designed for the titillation of men’. The ASA said: ‘Marks & Spencer said the purpose of the campaign was not to show Rosie as being overtly sexy but to show the product off in the best light. ‘M&S said additionally the brand values were that the range should stand for making women feel attractive and sensual from the confidence of wearing elegant and sophisticated lingerie. ‘They refuted any allegation that the range or supporting campaign was degrading to women or reinforced sexual stereotypes of women.’ The Advertising Standards Agency has banned an advert offering £2,000 loans in ten minutes at annual interest rates of more than 250 per cent because it is 'socially irresponsible'. The advert for personal loan firm Pounds to Pocket drew three complaints after promising viewers . 'No paperwork. No guarantor... No surprises or hidden fees, just fixed payments over 12 months.' But one viewer said that the APR of 278 per cent was only shown in small print and not featured prominently enough. Two more questioned claims by a customer in the advert that he had been turned down by mainstream banks and should have gone to Pounds to Pocket first. 'Socially irresponsible': An advert for Pounds to Pocket has been banned by the Advertising Standards Agency . They complained that it was socially irresponsible because it promotes the firm as a preferable option despite its considerably higher interest rates. Pounds to Pocket said that the APR was prominently included in the legal text, where applicable, and was held on screen for longer than the minimum on-screen hold time required. They said that the 'I wish I'd gone to Pounds to Pocket first' claim was an actual endorsement from a real customer. But the ASA upheld both complaints and banned the ad. A spokesman said that a 20 per cent discount on repayments offer had featured more prominently than the APR. He said: ""Because the RAPR (representative annual percentage rate) had not been given greater prominence than the incentive, we concluded that the ad breached the Code. Upholding the second complaint he said: 'We considered the character's comment that ""I was turned down by the mainstream lenders. I wish I'd gone to Pounds to Pocket first, as their application was fast and simple"" implied that credit was available to persons who might otherwise consider their access to credit restricted.'","Rosie Huntington Whiteley posed in her underwear for the chain's advert .

"Vulnerable Martin Ryan starved to death in an NHS hospital after 26 days without proper nourishment . As many as 1,165 people starved to death in NHS hospitals over the past four years fuelling claims nurses are too busy to feed their patients. The Department of Health branded the figures 'unacceptable' and said the number of unannounced inspections by the care watchdog will increase. According to figures released by the . Office for National Statistics following a Freedom of Information . request, for every patient who dies from malnutrition, four more have dehydration mentioned on their death certificate. Critics say nurses are too busy to feed patients and often food and drink are placed out of reach of vulnerable people. In 2011, 43 patients starved to death and 291 died in a state of severe malnutrition, while the number of patients discharged from hospital suffering from malnutrition doubled to 5,558. Dianne Jeffrey, chairwoman of Malnutrition Task Force, condemned the statistics. She told The Sunday Express: 'Too many are paying the price with their lives while being deprived of the basic right to good nutrition, hydration and support.' The revelations come after two non-executive directors resigned from Mid Staffordshire health trust after the announcement it was going into administration. Board members Eleanor Chumley-Roberts and Dr Lyn Hulme are to step down from the trust that was at the centre of the Stafford Hospital scandal. It has also been announced that Mid-Staffordshire may be the first foundation trust to be put into administration. Eleanor Chumley-Roberts (left) and Dr Lyn Hulme (right) are unhappy that . they had no input into the decision to put the trust in administration . Monitor, the watchdog that regulates trusts, said it was considering the move in order to 'safeguard services' for local patients. A public inquiry into the trust said that patients had experienced 'appalling' care between 2005 and 2009. It said that the trust had cared more about cost control than the quality and safety of the care it gave. Mid Staffordshire health trust is in control of Stafford Hospital, where an investigation showed substandard care resulted in hundreds of deaths. The families of patients involved in the Stafford Hospital scandal protested outside a meeting of NHS bosses this week and renewed their calls for the resignation of chief executive Sir David Nicholson. Mid Staffordshire health trust is in control of Stafford Hospital, where an investigation showed substandard care resulted in hundreds of deaths . A dozen people held placards with Sir David’s photograph accompanied by the words 'Resign', 'The man with no shame' and 'Too many deaths, no accountability'. A major investigation is under way at Bolton NHS Foundation Trust and acting chief executive Dr Jackie Bene has stepped down . Sir David, who has faced calls to quit since the Francis report revealed issues a Stafford Hospital, was instead given a vote of confidence. The trust has been the subject of three inquiries in four years. NHS hospitals have also stood accused of fiddling figures to mask the numbers of patients dying needlessly. A major investigation is now taking place at the Royal Bolton Hospital in Greater Manchester, where acting chief executive Dr Jackie Bene, stepped down. The trust had had one of the highest mortality rates in the country. But in 2011, the figures suddenly dropped by 10 per cent and the trust was named as one of only about 50 in the country with 'lower than expected' death rates. But it is feared that since 2001, an estimated 2,000-plus patients may have died unnecessarily at the trust. Vulnerable Martin Ryan starved to death in an NHS hospital 26 days without proper nourishment in 2005. The 43-year-old, who had Down's . syndrome, was admitted to Kingston Hospital after he suffered a stroke . which left him unable to swallow. But a 'total breakdown in communication' meant he was never fitted with a feeding tube. The case was highlighted by Mencap in . 2009. An internal inquiry by the hospital found that doctors had thought . nurses were feeding Mr Ryan, from Richmond, south-west London, through a . tube. By the time they found out this was not the case, he was too weak for an operation. He died in agony five days later. Worcestershire Acute NHS Hospital Trust was forced to pay out more than £400,000 last year in compensation after a patient starved to death and another was left unwashed for 11 weeks. In one of the worst ever cases of multiple NHS failings, patients were left begging for water or left hungry after trays of food were dumped too far from their reach. The 84-year-old starved to death in 2009 after being admitted following a fall. The man, who has not been identified at the request of his relatives, could only manage certain foods, but he was not fed properly and died two months later. On his death certificate, inanition, a clinical term for starvation, was recorded as the cause of death. A Department of Health spokeswoman said: 'Every NHS patient should expect to be looked after properly in hospital. 'It is completely unacceptable if patients go hungry or are malnourished. 'To help make sure patients get the right care - and to root out bad practice - the Care Quality Commission has increased the number of unannounced inspections that it undertakes, and soon it will publish its findings from a series of inspections looking specifically at dignity and nutrition. 'We are also investing £100 million on IT so nurses can spend more time with patients, not paperwork. 'That means nursing rounds where senior nurses will have more time to check that patients are comfortable, are helped to eat and drink, and are treated with the dignity and respect they deserve.'","For every patient who dies from malnutrition, four more have dehydration mentioned on their death certificate .

The buildings at Horse Guards are the headquarters of the Army's London District and provide accommodation for soldiers in the Queen's Life Guard, a unit which carries out its duties and performs on state occasions. Last week, senior Army officers made the decision to deploy armed troops there after Corporal Nathan Cirillo, 24, was shot dead by an Islamist fanatic two weeks ago while on unarmed guard duty at the National War Memorial in Ottawa.

"Attorney General Eric Holder has admitted that investigators may have gone too far in their recent attempts to prevent leaks to the media and he said the Justice Department needs to do a better job of balancing national security with press freedom. ‘I'm a little concerned that things have gotten a little out of whack,’ Holder told NBC on Wednesday. ‘I think we can do a better job than we have. We can reform those regulations, reform those guidelines to better reflect that balance.’ Holder has been embroiled in a media storm over a Justice Department subpoena of Associated Press phone records and, in particular, an investigation into leaks to Fox News correspondent James Rosen. Attorney General Eric Holder has admitted that the Justice Department needs to do a better job of balancing national security with press freedom . He said he was ‘not comfortable’ approving a search warrant affidavit for Rosen’s emails that characterized him as a criminal conspirator and would change the process. Although he approved some of the steps in the investigation, he said laws and regulations forced his hand and should be changed. ‘I don't like that, because it means me as official who has great respect for the press, is in essence saying a reporter doing his or her job and doing that important job is somehow branded a criminal,’ Holder said NBC. ‘I'm just not comfortable with that, we're going to change that.’ Holder had recused himself from the AP leak investigation and didn't personally sign off on that subpoena. Holder told NBC's Pete Williams that he has no intention of stepping down from his role as attorney general . Despite calls by some congressional Republicans for his resignation, Holder said he has ‘no intention’ of resigning now. ‘There are some things that I want to do, some things I want to get done that I have discussed with the president,’ Holder said. ‘And once I have finished that, I'll sit down with him and we'll determine when it's time to make a transition to a new attorney general.’ News emerged in May that Holder's agency secretly obtained phone records and emails from Associated Press and FOX News Channel journalists, in investigations targeting national security leaks. Neither news outlet was notified that the government was snooping on its personnel. Reactions from the establishment news media in Washington have ranged from annoyance to outrage, with the perceived threat to First Amendment press rights bringing a new level of aggression from many reporters about the other scandals facing the Obama administration. White House press secretary Jay Carney offered no direct defense of the Justice Department of Attorney General Eric Holder on Monday, but quoted the White House chief of staff doing so in a New York Times article . Holder's hold on his position in Washington has grown tenuous in recent weeks. He . personally approved a search warrant application for emails and phone . records belonging to Fox reporter James Rosen, telling a federal judge . that his status as a potential criminal co-conspirator trumped the . government's legal requirement to alert Fox News in advance or negotiate . with the leading cable news network. The . attorney general also, however, told the House Judiciary Committee . during a May 15 hearing that, 'With regard to the potential prosecution . of the press for the disclosure of material, that is not something I’ve . ever been involved in, heard of or would think would be a wise policy.' Rep. Bob Goodlatte, a Virginia Republican who chairs that committee, has . confirmed that he is investigating Holder's testimony to determine . whether he committed perjury. Sally Buzbee (L), Washington bureau chief at The Associated Press, saw phone records from 20 of her employees fall into the federal government's hands. The DOJ also seized Fox News reporter James Rosen's private emails and some of his parents' private communications . Rep. Darrell Issa, who chairs the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said Sunday on CNN that 'it would be kind to say he misled Congress.' 'It would be less kind and more accurate to say that would rise to be a lie by most people’s standards.' The Justice Department doesn't see it that way. 'The attorney general’s testimony concerning the potential prosecution of a member of the press,' a spokesperson said, 'was accurate and consistent with the facts' related to that leak case. Federal prosecutors, the spokesperson continued, never 'sought approval to bring criminal charges against the reporter.' Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, has raised the specter of a perjury charge as one possible outcome of a congressional investigation into Holders testimony . White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough defended Holder in a statement on Saturday to The New York Times. Holder, he said through a spokesman, “has the intellect, experience and integrity to efficiently run the Department of Justice and not get distracted by the partisans who seem more interested in launching political attacks than cooperating with him to protect the security and constitutional rights of the American people.' Asked Monday during a scheduled briefing for a comment on Holder's ability to remain in his job, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney referred reporters to McDonough's statement, which he said 'spoke for all of us' in the White House. 'I couldn't say it any better,' Carney said.","Holder has admitted that Justice Department investigators went too far with  attempts to prevent leaks to the media .

"Barack Obama has always been known for his silken words, soaring rhetoric and ability to use language to his advantage. Lately, however, the president seems to be losing command of the details. In a speech at a fundraiser in New York on Wednesday night, he took aim at Todd Akin, the political punch bag du jour on both sides of the political aisle. ‘Recently, some of you have been paying attention to the commentary of the Senator of Missouri, Mr Akin, who - the interesting thing here is that this is an individual who sits on the House Committee on Science and Technology, but somehow missed science class. Slip up: President Obama, pictured arriving at New York's JFK Airport yesterday, right, accidentally said that William McRaven, left, was a general, when in fact, he is an admiral . In town: The president is in the East Coast city to raise funds for his re-election campaign . ‘It's representative of a desire to go backwards instead of forwards, and to fight fights that we thought were settled twenty, thirty years ago.’ The problem is, Akin is a congressman who is running for a US Senate seat in Missouri. Senator Claire McCaskill, Obama’s favourite Senator until a few months ago when she started to distance herself from him in an effort to win re-election, might not particularly appreciate the President having conceded her seat already. Then there was the stop at Sloopy’s bar on the campus of Ohio State University where Obama posed will students to spell out the four letters in Ohio. Except that, initially at least, the President and the student on his right got their letters wrong, spelling: ‘O-I-H-O’ Perhaps most seriously, however, was Obama’s slip in an interview with KSDK in St Louis, Missouri when he was asked about the new 22-minute film ‘Dishonorable Disclosures’ by a group of former Special Forces troops and intelligence operatives. ‘I won't take this film too seriously,’ he responded. ‘I gather that one of the producers is a birther who still doesn't think I was born in this country. Know your place: William McRaven is and admiral not a general. As a SEAL, he is member of the US Navy, not US Army or US Marines . ‘You've got one who was a candidate, a Republican candidate for office. And a proud card carrying member of the Tea Party. So this is obviously a partisan film. ‘I'd advise that you talk to General McRaven, who's in charge of our Special Ops. I think he has a point of view in terms of how deeply . I care about what these folks do each and every day to protect our freedom.’ The difficulty with this is that William McRaven is and admiral not a general. As a SEAL, he is member of the US Navy, not US Army or US Marines. Obama has made mistakes with military terminology before. In February 2010, he mispronounced ‘corpsman’ – as ‘corpse-man’ instead of ‘core-man’ several times. Last year, he mixed up two Medal of Honor recipients, saying that ‘Jared Monti, was the first person who I was able to award the Medal of Honour to who actually came back and wasn’t receiving it posthumously’. Hang on Sloopy: Earlier this week, Obama, centre, and students accidentally spelled out O-I-H-O during a visit to Sloopy's Diner at the Ohio State University campus . In fact, Obama was referring to Staff Sergeant Salvatore Giunta. Obama had presented a posthumous Medal of Honor to the parents of SFC Monti, who was killed in action in June 2006, in September 2009. The Medal of Honor is the highest United States award for valour. It's the equivalent of the Victoria Cross. In the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and the names of recipients are seared on the hearts of many Americans. Some servicemen have criticised Obama for omitting their ranks, as he did with Monti. When Staff Sergeant Giunta received his Medal of Honor, Obama called him ‘Sal’ and ad libbed: ‘I really like this guy’. After hanging the medal around his neck, Obama did not salute him but gave him a hug. For servicemen, ranks are important – they have worked hard and, in many cases, risked their lives, to earn them. And it’s one thing to omit a rank and another to botch the rank of the highest-ranking Special Forces operator in the country. Perhaps the broader question is why . Obama though it appropriate to talk about how Admiral McRaven had ‘a . point of view in terms of how deeply I care about what these folks do . each and every day to protect our freedom’. Military . leaders should be respected as non-partisan figures. It is unseemly, at . best, for Obama to use Admiral McRaven for political purposes as a . character referee to tell voters how much he cares about American . troops. Romney has made his . own errors in terminology. He has referred to 'Afghans' as 'Afghanis' - . the country's currency - and to SEALs as 'soldiers', when they are . better described as sailors or troops. His campaign's mobile application . misspelled 'America' as 'Amercia'.","President's latest slip-up was calling Admiral William McRaven a general .

"This shocking array of firearms is just part of the terrifying arsenal of weapons seized by a police force in just the last year. The deadly haul of guns collected from the streets of the West Midlands include an Uzi, AK47 and an exact replica of the handgun used by Saddam Hussain. The myriad of over a hundred fierce firearms - some of which are modified or homemade - have been seized by, or been surrendered to, West Midland’s Police over the last 12 months.

Both have been seized by West Midlands Police . The cache of weapons are now being contained within a secure unit at a secret location by the force and are being used to train firearms officers. Pc Rob Pedley, a former firearms officer for 11 years, said: 'We obtain the guns through a variety of sources, many are seized but some are surrendered and handed in through amnesty’s and via other means. 'Some people have legitimately held licenses for rifles and decided to get rid of them - others we can perhaps connect to crimes or planned crimes.

Chief Inspector Paul Minor, head of the force’s firearms unit, added: 'The perception of firearms units may be weapons and fast cars but in reality it can be a lonely place. 'Sometimes officers need to make split-second decisions and decisions that could have catastrophic consequences. 'Our officers are trained to an exceptionally high standard by experts with many years firearms tactical experience; that’s why I’m confident that in the vast majority of incidents they will make the right decision.'","Cache includes exact replica of the handgun used by Saddam Hussain .

"Footage has revealed the sparse and yet contented life of Daniel Suelo - the man who has chosen to live without money for the past 12 years. Suelo, now 51, renounced money in 2000, left his last $30 dollars in a phone booth and walked into the desert to start a new life in Moab, Utah. His way of life has become an inspiration to thousands of Americans who have suffered in the economic crash and activists like the Occupy movement, disillusioned with a society consumed by avarice and greed. Scroll down for video . A life less ordinary: Daniel Suelo sits in the Utah mountains where he has lived for more than a decade without using money . Mark Sundeen, author and friend of Daniel, has written a biography about his lifestyle after following him closely for several years. Sundeen, whose book is entitled The Man Who Quit Money, freely admits that he had lost touch with Suelo for several years and when he heard that he was living without money, 'he thought he had gone crazy or had some kind of mental breakdown'. However following the economic crash in 2008, Sundeen began to come round to Suelo's mindset. Sundeen said: 'Here's someone who is saying I don't know what the solution is but I'm going to disobey. He continued: 'Our financial system is so big we can't control it and in so many ways we feel enslaved by it. Worse, we feel powerless to change it. Idyllic life: Daniel Suelo lives in the Utah wilderness, miles from the nearest town where he can enjoy plenty of solitude . 'The fact is, if everyone lived like the . average American, the world would actually collapse more quickly than . if everyone lived like Suelo.'

'My philosophy is to use only what is . freely given or discarded and what is already present and already . running (whether or not I existed).' 'Our whole society is designed so . that you have to have money,' Suelo added. 'You have to be a part of the . capitalist system. It's illegal to live outside of it.' As well as quitting cash, he threw . away his passport and driving license and changed his legal name, . Shellabarger, to Suelo, Spanish for ‘soil’. Ever since then Suelo has lived . outdoors, camped in the wilderness, lived in caves, stayed in communes . and spent nights in stranger’s homes. For . several years Suelo set up home in a cave, 200 feet across and 50 feet . tall, on the edge of a cliff in the Arches National Park, Utah. Here he . carved a bed out of rock, foraged for food, drank from springs and . bathed in a creek. Any hikers were welcomed to stay with him to share his ‘home’, his books and the wildflowers and cactus seeds that he ate. Born into an ultra-conservative fundamentalist family, Suelo took his faith extremely seriously growing up. At . college, however, he re-examined his beliefs and decided that money and . the divide it creates between those who have it and those that don’t . was both unchristian and wrong.

"A TV producer lost full custody of her biological daughter after the judge ruled her lesbian lover was the more responsible parent - the first case of its kind in New York involving a same-sex couple. A Family Court judge ruled against Emmy-winning TV producer Brook Altman, from New York, in favor of the six-year-old's adoptive mother Allison Scollar. In October 2006, Altman gave birth to the lesbian couple's baby daughter after a sperm donation from Scollar's close friend Robert Frame. Lesbian lovers: Brook Altman, left, and Allison Scollar, had been together four years when they decided to have a child together with a sperm donation from a friend . Custody: Manhattan real estate attorney Allison Scollar, right, defeated the little girl's biological mom, Emmy-winning TV producer Brook Altman, left, in a bitter court battle . The now-estranged couple had been together four years and were living together at the time after meeting on a blind date. Frame renounced his parental rights and Scollar, who is a Manhattan real estate attorney, legally adopted the baby girl. But tension arose when Frame insisted he had a say in the raising of the child and the biological parents often took each other's side and alienated Scollar, according to the New York Post. After the couple eventually split in 2010, Altman fled to California with their daughter. Scollar sought - and was immediately granted - temporary custody of the child by a New York judge, and Altman was ordered to return. After that, what had started out as an acrimonious split soon turned ugly. According to Scollar, her former partner started accusing her of being an alcoholic and of child abuse, so much so that the Administration for Children’s Services performed a gynecological examination of the girl - leaving her traumatized. Happier times: Though Brook, left, was the girl's biological mother, a judge ruled that Allison, right, the adoptive mother, was the more responsible parent . Scollar told the New York Post days after she was awarded custody: 'Love doesn't just come from biology. And the minute I saw this little baby, I knew she was mine' Altman herself later admitted that 'she did not believe the child was sexually abused' but insisted she had a 'ball' and a 'blast' at the examination, according to the New York Post. In the ruling, the judge said the . biology of the child was irrelevant and that Scollar was 'indeed the . more responsible parent looking out for the child’s best interests, not . her own interests'. She added that Altman, a . former producer for Martha Stewart’s TV show, 'behaved more as a friend or older sister than a responsible parent.' She noted that Scollar had the child on a schedule, always brought her to school on time and to therapy appointments. Altman, on the other hand was a 'freer spirit' and a 'more laid-back parent' who would 'miss therapy appointments or be late to . school or camp bus because she overslept or felt that play dates were . more important than therapy or that play dates should end late in the . evening so that the child and she were too tired to commit to a . schedule.' Scollar told the New York Post days after she was awarded custody: 'Love doesn’t just come from biology. And . the minute I saw this little baby, I knew she was mine. 'It’s a step closer to the gay community being acknowledged as parents. The law needs to catch up to diverse families — and it has.' Altman is planning to appeal the decision, according to the Post.","Brook Altman and Allison Scollar had a child six years ago after a friend donated sperm .

"Seattle Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll is using rugby to change the way his Super Bowl-winning side tackle, and his approach could have far-reaching implications for the NFL . The 63-year-old used video footage last summer to cite examples of leading with the shoulder, not the head, to make American football safer. With a concussion lawsuit involving 4,500 former players swirling in the background, Carroll and defensive passing game coordinator Rocky Seto have taken a proactive step. ‘It’s a culmination of myself, personally making the transition of not fighting the old way and giving in to that we’ve got to take care of our players in a better way,’ the avuncular Carroll said during his press conference on Wednesday. Seattle Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll is studying rugby to change the way his players tackle . After studying rugby, he was intrigued by the quality of tackling and the lack of injuries despite no helmets or body armour. And he saw no reason why the approach could not be adopted by his fast, hard-hitting defense, widely considered to be the best in the NFL. ‘We have found that you can tackle and totally emphasise shoulder tackling and getting your head out of football and really that coincides so much with the language and the message we’ve heard come about for all of the right reasons, that we wanted to share it, so we did. ‘With The Huddle Company that distributes stuff to all of the high school coaches, 14,000 high school coaches and thousands of youth coaches, we thought maybe we can get the word out. Carroll is intrigued by the quality of tackling in rugby and also the safety considering there is no protection . Seattle's defence, led by Richard Sherman (above) is among the best the league has seen in recent years . ‘When I first asked Roger (Goodell) and sent it to the league and said what do you think, and one of the first phone calls I got was from Coach John Madden. He called and said, “Where has this been? We’ve needed this. This gives us an opportunity to shift the language some and the focus.” ‘I know that the league sent it out to everybody that they send stuff out to, so thousands and thousands of people. The responses that we get have all almost always been favourable. I love the responses we get from coaches that say, ‘Thanks for doing this because it helps us with our kids,’ or whatever. This is just the start though.’ The NFL has taken steps to protect its players, with penalties for head-to-head contact. And you will seldom witness a Seahawks player doing so as Carroll does not permit it. Seahawks head coach Carroll at the team's practice session in Arizona on Wednesday . The Seattle Seahawks practice in Tempe, Arizona on Wednesday ahead of the Super Bowl . His philosophy is rubbing off on his players, as defensive end Cliff Avril explained: ‘I think you’re conscious of it because he beats it into your head so often. ‘He talks about it a lot. Just tackling in general, and style of tackling is something he emphasises so much. Subconsciously, you start thinking about it more and more and even though you don’t tackle full-speed in practice, in your head you’re finishing off the tackle. By the time game day comes, it works out for us because we come out fast.’ With teams already copying Seattle’s model, should Carroll lead Seattle to consecutive Super Bowls, his approach to tackling could see a sea change in the NFL.","Pete Carroll intrigued by the way players tackle in rugby .

"A mother was killed in front of her family when she was struck by lightning on a Brazilian beach. Rosangela Biavati a 36-year-old married mother of one, died instantly when she was hit by the bolt of electricity during a trip to Guaruja, a popular seaside resort on the coast of Sao Paulo. The first photograph shows the victim heading towards the water with outstretched arms as she warns her 11-year-old son to get out of the sea because of the gathering storm overhead. The next image captures the electrical discharge streaking down. The mother runs towards the sea, waving her arms at her 11-year-old son as she tries to get him to return to shore . The split second the lightning bolt hits Rosangela Biavati, obscured by a vehicle, in front of her horrified friends . A Mitsubishi pickup obscures the moment the bolt hits the woman as she steps towards the water’s edge but the tragic outcome is clearly evident in the following image in the sequence of shots. Three men, including the victim’s husband who is wearing white swimming trucks, drag her lifeless body onto the beach. According to Rosângela's husband, his wife had gone to tell his son and nephews, who were swimming in the sea, to get out because of the bad weather. Rosangela Biavati died instantly when she was hit by the bolt while trying to save her son . As she stepped into the water she was hit by a single bolt of lightning. 'The weather started to close in and we decided to leave. I was putting our bags into the car, and the kids were on the beach. 'The next minute my wife was lying on the floor. I received a mild shock,' said a distraught Leandro Lopes Santos. The victim’s brother Elias Biavati added: 'When I saw my sister she was already lying on the ground and people were trying to revive her by massaging her heart.' According to the Biavati, another sister who was standing near to Roseangela when the lightning struck received a black eye. 'We are in a state of shock. My brother-in-law is devastated by the sudden death of his wife. We can’t believe how it happened - it could have been any one of us,' the victim’s brother said. A total of 13 members, all from the same family, had gone to the beach for the day. They arrived at midday but by 3pm the sunny weather had changed as storm clouds gathered and the weather became overcast and the atmosphere heavy. Café owner Arionaldo Garrido, who was on the beach, said he quickly realised something was wrong. 'We had taken our tables inside because we could see a storm was coming. Several rays had already flashed across the sky and streaked down,' he recalled. 'Suddenly we heard a loud bang and saw several people running. We knew that something terrible had happened. It's a real tragedy for the family who have lost a wife and mother.' Climatologist Rodolfo Bonafim, from environmental organisation Friends of Water, said that the lightning bolts are common around this time of year. 'There is a high incidence of lightning now because of an increase in heat and humidity. It’s more concentrated at this time during the summer than at other times in the year because the humidity is higher. 'The seaside area is also a region bounded by the Atlantic Ocean, making it a perfect zone for this type of inclement weather,' he said.

"Two troopers have been injured after falling from a tree stand during the manhunt for cop-killer Eric Frein three weeks after his murderous rampage at a Pennsylvania barracks. State Police claim self-trained survivalist Frein, 31, appears to be under-pressure and getting careless, leaving clear tracks which the team is following. But last night they were forced to halt proceedings to call a Medivac helicopter after two troopers fell 20 feet while searching for the fugitive in a tree house. Injured: Two troopers searching for Eric Frein in the woods in Price Township, near Canadensis, PA, have been airlifted to hospital following an accident on Wednesday night. The manhunt has now entered its 20th day . According to authorities, the men had entered the tree stand to check that it was clear. State police said the floor collapsed and both men fell to the ground and were treated by tactical medics at the scene. It comes just a day after the team found two potentially lethal pipe bombs hidden deep in the woods that could have detonated at any point. Trooper Connie Devens said the injuries sustained in the accident on Wednesday night are non-life threatening. A massive manhunt has been underway for 31-year-old Eric Frein in the rugged terrain of the Pocono Mountains since September 12 - and there is no sign of a foreseeable end to the hunt. The self-taught survivalist is charged with killing Cpl. Bryon Dickson and seriously wounding Trooper Alex Douglass outside their barracks in Blooming Grove. Hundreds of law enforcement officers have been searching an area near Frein's home in Canadensis. On Tuesday, Lt Col George Bivens said his team found bombs were covered in metal nuts designed as shrapnel. 'They could cause significant injury. They could be fatal,' said Bivens. At large: Self-taught survivalist Frein, 31, is believed to be slowing down but he is still nowhere in sight . Manhunt: Pennsylvania State Police have searched numerous areas surrounding the northeastern barracks . But Bivens said he is confident that Frein is getting desperate and careless, leaving behind items that he may need in a future battle with the police he has vowed to kill. The two bombs were not deployed, Bivens said, but they were fully functional and could be set off either by a fuse or a trip wire. One of them was in a plastic bag. 'It is typical of his non-confrontational and gutless efforts to kill or injure law enforcement from a distance,' said Bivens. 'All of this indicates that we are putting significant pressure on him.' Bivens said he believes Frein left behind some items as cops move in. 'He abandoned them because he was under pressure. It was not from his own choosing,' he said. 'He may very well be looking for a fight. He already picked the fight.' Explosive experts in the Pennsylvania State Police are now examining the bombs. 'They have assured me they are fully functional devices,' Bevins added. Discovered: On Tuesday, the team uncovered bombs that appeared to be modeled into shrapnel using nuts . All day Monday, officers looked in an area behind the Barrett Elementary Center, a school which closed last year. FBI officers on camouflage went in and out of land around the Pasold Farms Natural Preserve. But all they found was a married couple who had gone into the woods to get a closer look at the searchers. The couple was given a reprimand and hauled out of the search area. By Tuesday, officers had returned to the area around Snow Hill Road, where earlier Bivens had said they had Frein contained in a five-square mile area. Cops say Frein then made his getaway in a green 2001 Jeep but crashed it into a swamp two miles north of the barracks. They say he then made his way on foot 25 miles through dense forest back to the area close to the home he shared with his parents and teenage sister. Over the past week they have found an AK-47 that was missing from his home along with soiled diapers and a rare brand of Serbian cigarette. Frein is known to have read survivalist literature that advises wearing a diaper to allow someone to remain in place over extended periods, leading to locals dubbing him the 'diaper sniper.'","Two troopers airlifted to hospital after 'accident' on Wednesday night .

"A retired soldier flew thousands of miles to reunite with the intrepid German shepherd that served alongside him in Iraq and the touching footage has quickly gone viral. Retired Air Force Sergeant David Simpson made a best friend in the form of military pooch Robbie as the two served together securing dangerous city streets in Iraq for four years. But their beautiful relationship came to an abrupt halt a year ago when Simpson left the military and his canine comrade continued to serve. Scroll down for video... Heartwarming: Touching footage of retired Air Force sergeant David Simpson reuniting with his canine partner of four years has quickly gone viral . The intervening months were so difficult for Simpson that he immediately purchased a $2,000 plane ticket to Germany to adopt Robbie when he learned that dog, too, was retiring. '[It's] probably the most difficult task we have to do, other than having your dog passing away,' the father of three, who now lives in Mulberry, Florida, told FOX 13. 'It was very tough to go through, and you don't know if the dog understands. Having to say goodbye, that is heartbreaking.' Thankfully, the heartbreak was only temporary. Partners: Simpson and Robbie served side by side securing dangerous city streets in Iraq . The happy pair reunited at Germany's Spangdahlem Air Base, where Simpson had flown from his Florida home at a personal cost of $2,000 to adopt Robbie after he, too, retired .

Never change: The 85-pound pooch showed all the trademark rambunctiousness Simpson remembered when they were reunited . The pair patrolled streets and performed security checks at military bases together for fouor years . 'My goal for him is to allow him to have as much fun and relaxation for the rest of his life. I just want him to enjoy his retirement,' Simpson said . Now Robbie is living in the Simpson household, learning how to live ina family full of young children. If more recent footage of the dog frollicking in Simpson's sunny backyard is any indication, the transition won't be all that hard. And either way, Robbie deserves to be happy as much as master.

"Daily showers could become a thing of the past, if a new beauty trend called 'cleansing reduction' takes off. Instead of bathing every day, proponents whittle their washing habits down to once or twice a week on the grounds that too much cleansing can strip the skin and hair of essential natural oils. While it might sound disgusting, it would seem that cleansing reduction is catching on, after a poll for tissue manufacturer, SCA, found that 41 per cent of British men and 33 per cent of women no longer shower every day. Shower optional? 41 per cent of British men don't wash every day according to a poll by tissue company, SCA . The poll also revealed that a filthy 12 per cent said that they indulge in a 'proper wash' just once a week. It is the younger generation who are leading the trend for joining the great unwashed, with 37 per cent of teenagers admitting to taking a 'shower in a can' - that's a quick spritz of deodorant to you and me - on a regular basis, according to market analysts, Mintel. An RSA blog on the subject also attracted some illuminating responses, including one committed soap dodger, who revealed that they washed only 'when dirty, sweaty or smelly, so if I've been gardening or out for a vigorous bike ride, or if it's just very hot weather.' Disgusting as it might sound, going for long periods without bathing is nothing new, according to Lancaster University sociologist, Dr Elizabeth Lancaster. According to Lancaster, daily showers are a relatively recent development and less than a century ago, a weekly bath would have been considered perfectly adequate. 'Now we think nothing of showering once, twice or even three times a day, before and after work or going out and after the gym,' she said in an interview with the Times. 'It has embedded itself in our routine and become an essential, not an optional, thing to do.' Soap dodgers: Both Prince Harry and Jessica Simpson are said to prefer using dry, rather than liquid, shampoo . Popular: Batiste's dry shampoo, £1.49, has become a festival season essential and is a life saver for travellers . While dermatologists worry about the impact all the washing could have on your skin, green campaigners have long argued that reducing the amount of time we spend in the shower would benefit the environment. Waterwise, an NGO dedicated to reducing water consumption in the UK, argues that having fewer or shorter showers 'will use less water and less energy' and will also 'reduce your carbon footprint, which helps prevent global warming.' Its long-running 'Shower Power' campaign has attracted some celebrity supporters too, most notably the former children's TV presenter, Kriss Akabusi. But while preserving the environment is driving the soap-free trend for some, for many more, it's simply because they're too lazy to get up early for a wash. A survey by the Global Hygiene Council last year found that 58 per cent of British men regularly miss their morning shower because they are too idle or too rushed. Likewise, sales of time-saving products such as dry shampoo have soared, with Asda reporting a 37 per cent rise in sales. What's more, they add, one in five products are bought by men - possibly including Prince Harry who once revealed that he hadn't washed his hair for two years. Clean? Prince Harry arrives at Westminster Abbey for the coronation celebrations - hopefully after a shower . With some hairdressers arguing that too much washing strips hair of sebum, resulting in a lank and greasy look, it would seem that he - and fellow dry shampoo addict, Jessica Simpson - might be on to something. Interestingly, a study conducted by the University of California found that too much washing can actually be bad for you, because it strips away beneficial bugs that the body uses to help ward off infections. 'A vigorous daily shower would disturb the natural bug flora of the skin as well as skin oils,' revealed John Oxford, Professor of Virology at Queen Mary's School of Medicine and Dentistry. Nevertheless, Oxford told the Times that he was concerned by a study released by the Hygiene Council that found nearly half of the population wash their hands less than five times a day, saying it means our hands carry 'as many germs as a toilet bowl'. But despite his dim view of sink-dodgers, Oxford still doesn't think we need to shower as much as we do. 'As long as people wash their hands often enough and pay attention to the area of the body below the belt, showering or bathing every other day would do no harm. 'Even twice a week would not be a problem if people used a bidet daily as most infectious bugs hang around our lower halves. 'We pay too much attention to the body beautiful and smelling good, with perfumes for men and women,' he added. 'We should wash to stop cross-infection, not for grooming reasons.'

"American marines injured a Brazilian prostitute after throwing her out of an official Embassy car, it was reported today. Romilda Ferreira was left with a broken collar bone, two broken ribs and a punctured lung after the incident in Brazil's capital Brasilia. The three marines on a U.S. Embassy security team, and an Embassy staff member, were pulled out of the country before police were able to press charges, according to Brazil's Jornal Nacional programme. U.S. marines are accused of injuring a Brazilian prostitute after throwing her out of an official Embassy car . Romilda Ferreira was left with a broken collar bone, two broken ribs and a punctured lung after the incident in Brazil's capital Brasilia . The incident came to light after U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta was questioned about it by a Brazilian reporter during a press conference . The revelation comes a week after ten American Secret Service agents were accused of hiring prostitutes in Colombia prior to president Barack Obama's visit to the Summit of Americas. The scandal blew up after a prostitute fought with an agent who had slept with her at a Colombian hostel but then refused to hand over the £800 they had agreed upon. This latest incident, which happened in November last year, came to light after U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, in Brazil during a Latin American tour, was questioned about it by a Brazilian reporter during a press conference. According to a Brazilian police investigation, the four U.S. Embassy officials had visited a nightclub in the centre of Brasilia where they had hired a group of prostitutes. The three marines on a U.S. Embassy security team, and an Embassy staff member, were pulled out of the country before police were able to press charges, it was claimed . One of the Americans and at least one . woman left the club by taxi, but Ms Ferreira and another women got into . an official U.S. Embassy van with the other three men. As they pulled away there was a discussion about how much the women were to be paid, and one of the marines pushed Ms Ferreira out of the car, where she ended up being run over by the vehicle. Speaking to the Jornal Nacional news programme, Romilda said she tried to hold on to the door but was dragged under the wheels. She said: 'I tried to get up and . grabbed the doorknob. That was when they told the driver to go. Then I . felt my leg burning. I let go and fell underneath the van. I hit my head . and passed out.' The Americans then allegedly drove away without offering assistance. Police . investigating the incident requested the arrest of the driver of the . van and one of the marines for bodily injury and failure to rescue. But U.S. authorities removed the four men from the country before they could be charged with the crimes. The four staff involved in the claims were working at the U.S. Embassy in Brazil (pictured) Centre of scandal: Sex worker Dania Suarez, 24, claimed she made a scene when a Secret Service agent in Colombia did not give her enough money . Embarrassment: U.S. President Barack Obama, pictured walking across the South Lawn of the White House, is now facing two scandals over the conduct of his staff abroad . Speaking to reporters in Brasilia, Mr Panetta said the men were pulled from the country, two of the marines had their ranks reduced and the embassy staff member was removed from his post. He added that the embassy had tracked Ms Ferreira down and paid for her medical expenses. He added: 'This incident was fully investigated and all those involved were punished. They are no longer in this country. This type of behaviour is unacceptable.' He said he had 'no tolerance for that kind of conduct. Where it takes place you can be sure that we will act to make sure that they are punished.' Ms Ferreira, who is still recovering from her injuries, said she now intends to sue the American embassy.","Probe found four Obama officials hired prostitutes in Brasilia nightclub .

"HUNCHBACK: King Richard III . Richard III is finally to receive a burial fit for a king – more than 500 years after  he was killed in battle. Remains that archaeologists believe are those of the king  are to be buried in Leicester Cathedral if DNA tests prove that the bones are his. The skeleton was uncovered last month in what is now the car park of Leicester City Council’s social services department. The site was formerly a chapel. The body in the car park has an arrow in its back – matching Richard’s death at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485. It also has scoliosis – severe curvature of the spine – tying in with  the famous description by Shakespeare and others of the monarch as a hunchback. If the tests are positive, the king will then be given a  burial inside the Cathedral,  the Ministry of Justice announced last week. The decision comes after  rows between MPs as to where Richard – the last English monarch to die in battle – should be laid to rest. Some said he should be given a state burial in Westminster Abbey because he was a reigning monarch. Others said the remains should be buried in Worksop, South Yorkshire, the centre of the Plantagenet monarch’s kingdom. But in a parliamentary answer, the Government settled for Leicester Cathedral, a stone’s throw from the car park. Jon Ashworth, Labour MP for Leicester South, said: ‘This is really good news. Richard III has been lying in Leicester  for 500 years – it seems only appropriate that he should be buried in Leicester. 'It will be  a boost for tourism to the city.’ Burial: The spot (circled in red) where archaeologists believe they may have found the remains of King Richard III.

"The makers of kitchen appliance Thermomix are facing a customer backlash after they released a new model without giving Australian shoppers adequate warning. Customers who recently purchased the old model TM31 for $1939 say they feel tricked and would have waited to purchase the new model TM5, which came out on Saturday and is only $50 more expensive, had they been informed. To add insult to injury, many customers were told no new model was on the way and the older model is now $250 cheaper. Scroll down for video . The new model Thermomix, which was released in Australia on Saturday, has 10 per cent more capacity and a touch screen . The German-designed 'twelve appliances in one' device has an almost cult-like following. They cannot be bought in stores, and shoppers hold 'Thermomix parties' similar to Tupperware parties where a Thermomix consultant comes out to a customer's home and demonstrates how it works to a group of their friends. There are more than 3000 Thermomix consultants across Australia. Now angry shoppers have begun mobilising on social media, targeting the Thermomix Australia Facebook and Twitter pages with abuse and setting up a 'Thermomix unhappy customers' Facebook page which has almost 1000 likes. Others have complained to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and state Fair Trading departments, and a change.org petition started by Georgina Shelley from Brisbane has received 600 signatures. In her petition statement Ms Shelley claims customers and consultants were kept in the dark. 'Many like myself, asked the question before purchasing, if there was a new Thermomix on the way,' she wrote. 'My consultant told me that she hadn't heard anything about it.' She continued: 'Thermomix AU have misled customers by saying they didn't know about the new model and couldn't disclose this information to customers but as of Saturday when the new model was launched, they had updated their website and were holding training sessions around Australia for their sales teams, using the new TM5. To say they didn't know is an out and out lie.' Lea Fowler, 58, from Bullsbrook in Perth, bought a Thermomix for herself on August 4 and another for a friend on August 14. 'That really riles me because I've bought her a gift that's already an old model,' Ms Fowler told Daily Mail Australia. Lea Fowler, 58, from Bullsbrook in Perth, feels misled by Thermomix . 'It's really frustrating, I had the consultant come out and I was very specific about asking her about new models.' Ms Fowler said customers like her are so angry because $2000 was a lot of money to spend. 'That's why they're copping so much flak, it's not that machine's not worth that kind of money, it's purely that they weren't transparent with what was coming into the market,' she said. 'It was a deception of Australian customers.' Ms Fowler said she spent years wanting a Thermomix before she finally bought one. 'If you're making risotto you chuck the onion, the butter and the garlic in and it chops the onion, sautés it with the garlic and then your add your rice and stock and set it to cook and it does it all,' she said. 'You come back after 10 minutes and it's done.' Peta Sargent, 40, from Dee Why in Sydney, is an admin on the 'Thermomix unhappy customers' Facebook page and said some customers who ordered their device after August 20 had been offered a refund or upgrade to the new model. But Ms Sargent, who ordered hers on August 18, has been told she does not qualify. An email from Thermomix Customer Service told her: 'Your Thermomix consultant did not know about the new product at the time of your demonstration and has been presenting the Thermomix of proven quality and value. 'Decisions about the release of new models are not made by Thermomix but are made by our overseas manufacturer and are confidential until Thermomix in Australia are officially notified to release such information to Customers and the public.' The old model TM31 is now retailing for $250 cheaper . It continued: 'The Thermomix Model 31 is an amazing kitchen appliance that will live up to all that you were shown at the demonstration which lead you to your purchase. 'I understand with all the talk and hype of a new model this can make you feel let down, but please think back to the reasons you purchased the Thermomix, as the TM31 has certainly not been superseded by the new model and will live up to all that it is designed to do as per your presentation.' An ad spruiking the new model claims it has 10 per cent more capacity, a new locking system 'for better handling', a touch screen, a new measuring cup and says it is quieter and more powerful than the old model. The company website claims home cooks can throw ingredients in their Thermomixes and are able make 'salads in 6 seconds', 'cake mix in 30 seconds', 'sauces and gravies in five minutes' and 'soups in 20 minutes'. Daily Mail Australia has contacted Thermomix for comment.","Makers of kitchen appliance Thermomix are facing a customer backlash .

"Arsenal eased to a 2-0 away win over Manchester City on Sunday afternoon courtesy of goals from Santi Cazorla and Olivier Giroud. NEIL ASHTON provides an assessment of each player at the Etihad Stadium. MANCHESTER CITY: . Joe Hart - Went the right way for Cazorla penalty, but it was struck hard and true. Appeared to have no chance with Giroud strike in second half. 6 . Pablo Zabaleta - Poor in the first half, barely got forward into his customary attacking positions. 5.5 . Vincent Kompany - Could not believe he had conceded a penalty. Later booked for foul on Giroud. 5 . Manchester City defender Vincent Kompany  appeals to referee Mike Dean as he concedes a penalty . Martin Demichelis - Surrenders possession too easily when he is barely under pressure. Lost concentration. 5 . Gael Clichy - Under pressure from Oxlade-Chamberlain, but combed through the Arsenal defence a couple of times. 6 . Fernandinho - Substituted and it was the right decision. Limited input, replaced by Lampard. 4 . Fernando - Could not keep pace with the constant running of Bellerin and Ramsey. Tough game for him in there. 4 . Jesus Navas - Swapped wings with Milner to try to get into the game, barely registered. 5 . David Silva (right) holds off Aaron Ramsey as he attempts to win the ball for Arsenal at the Etihad Stadium . David Silva - The little magician flickered at times, but this was way short of his A game. 5.5 . James Milner - Ineffective, couldn’t make an impression on the game. Substituted at half-time. 6 . Sergio Aguero - Is he fit? This was miles off from the hat-trick against Bayern Munich in the Champions League here. 4.5 . City's Argentinian striker Sergio Aguero (right) is fouled by Arsenal's Spanish midfielder Santi Cazorla . SUBSTITUTES : . Stevan Jovetic (for Jame Milner 46): Barely made a difference. 5 . Frank Lampard (Fernandinho 63): Another body to City’s attack but he could not stop Arsenal. 6 . Edin Dzeko (Jesus Navas 76): Too late to beat this stubborn Arsenal defence. 6 . Man of the minute Alexis Sanchez does battle with fellow former La Liga man Navas . ARSENAL: . Ospina - A virtual spectator in the first half, excellent block from Navas at the start of the second. Some decent claims too. Arsenal’s first choice? 7 . Bellerin - Put a shift in at right back. It’s all beginning to come together for this Arsenal defence. 7 . Mertesacker - Organised, showed leadership qualities and put in a powerful performance at the back. Good on him. 7.5 . Koscielny - Ruffed by early booking, but settled in to the game. Decent clearances in each half. 7 . Arsenal defender Nacho Monreal is tracked by City winger Jesus Navas . Monreal - . In the end the game has to ask itself whether it wants honest pros or not. Mike Dean swallowed it. Other than that he was excellent. 7 . Ramsey - Missed a big chance to make it 2-0 in the second. Careless with possession too, unusual for him. 7 . Coquelin - Worked hard in the boiler room, sat in front of Arsenal back four to mop up everything. Played beyond his years. 7.5 . Cazorla opens the scoring from the penalty spot after Kompany was adjudged to of brought down Monreal . Penalty scorer Carzloa is mobbed by the Arsenal player following his first-half penalty . Cazorla - Big penalty, hit with conviction. Lovely touches, battling qualities in the final third of the game. 7 . Oxlade-Chamberlain - Couple of lung-busting first half runs, but this game wasn’t quite for him. Replaced by Rosicky. 6 . Olivier Giroud makes the game safe as he heads Arsenal's second of the game past keeper Joe Hart . Hart can only look on as Giroud's header bounces past the England keeper to double Arsenal's lead . Giroud - Towering performance, led the line brilliantly and and made City’s defence work hard. Brave header deflected wide, first chance of match. Deserved his goal. 8 . Sanchez - One decent chance in the second half, but this was one Arsenal performance where others shone. 6. SUBSTITUTES: . Tomas Rosicky (Oxlade-Chamberlain 67): Added experience and game management to the team in the last 20 minutes. 7 . Kieran Gibbs (Alexis Sanchez 84): Useful addition to Arsenal’s defence for the final few minutes. 6 .

"A grandmother lying on her deathbed after suffering from a brain aneurysm claimed she was ‘cured’ when she looked at a photograph of the late pope. Floribeth Mora said she saw an image of Pope John Paul II in a newspaper and it told her to ‘stand up’ and ‘don’t be afraid’. Remarkably, Mora, her doctors and the Catholic Church said her aneurysm disappeared on the very same day in a ‘miracle’. Floribeth Mora stands by her shrine to Pope John Paul II inside the entrance to her home in La Union de Cartago, Costa Rica . The transformation of her health cleared the way for the late pope to be declared a saint on April 27 in a ceremony at the Vatican where Mora is a guest of honour and will meet the current pope. The 50-year-old Costa Rican said: ‘Everyone can think what they want. What I know is that I'm healthy.’ Mora was diagnosed with a brain aneurysm and sent home to rest and take medication in April 2011. Doctors said the problem was inoperable and she returned home waiting to die. But a few weeks later, on May 1, the day of John Paul’s beatification six years after his death, she spotted his photograph. Then, she said, it spoke to her. She surprised her family by walking around, and, after her doctors declared her healed, word spread quickly to the local church, and from there to the Vatican. John Paul II will be recognised as a saint at a ceremony on April 27 . Mora, from San Jose, said speaking about her experience has become her calling. She said: ‘I’ve got so much to do that I’m going to dedicate myself above all to telling the world the story of God’s greatness and what it’s done for me.’ She said people have asked her whether the experience was somehow imagined, or the result of mental illness. She said: ‘I have no reason to doubt what I am. I am healthy and that’s the most important thing.’ She said she ignores skeptics who doubt she was really healed. The church-certified ‘miracle’ has made Mora a symbol of faith for thousands of Costa Ricans and Catholics around the world. She said she has been greeting a stream of local and international visitors in her modest home in a middle-class neighbourhood outside the Costa Rican capital. She accepts invitations to as many as four masses a day and she has been given so many letters to deliver to current pontiff Pope Francis that she has had to buy an extra suitcase. Mora suspended her late-in-life law studies and much of her work for her family security business to dedicate herself full-time to her role as a symbol of faith. She said: ‘With all of this going on I appreciate having my own business, because if I had a boss, they would have already fired me for missing so much work.’ Mora, a grandmother who lives with her husband, a retired police officer, has images of John Paul in nearly every room in her house. As a guest of honour at the ceremony, Ms Mora will meet Pope Francis. So many people have given her letters to deliver to the pontiff that she has had to buy an extra suitcase . Her 15-year-old son, the youngest of three, tells her off occasionally for attending so many masses but she said: ‘I have to be there’. She said she is often overwhelmed by the petitions for prayer the faithful ask her to take to Francis. She said: ‘I have to buy a special suitcase for those letters, because some of them are big packages Mora said she now feels great and has none of the symptoms that brought her to the brink of death three years ago and has no doubt her life is owed to John Paul. She added: ‘It’s important for them to name him a saint, but for me he’s already a saint. ‘I never imagined I would become a part of all of this.’","Floribeth Mora claims her brain aneurysm was cured by looking at a picture of the late pope .

"A rare Rolls-Royce Phantom from 1925 with an elephant rifle and hand-cranked machine gun in tow is up for auction. The red ‘Tiger Car’ Phantom I, which was commissioned by the maharaja of Kotah, India, will be auctioned today at Barrett-Jackson’s Las Vegas auction. The annual auction event, now in its sixth year, started on September 26 and finishes today.

Royal car: The vintage vehicle was commissioned by India's Umed Singh II, who was the maharaja of Kotah, India, from 1889 to 1940 . It was not unusual to see maharajas in 19th and early 20th century India spend a lot of money on their customised cars, with plush interiors and flashy colours. But high-powered weaponry was not typically on the car pimping agenda. The car’s original owner, Umed Singh II, who was the maharaja of Kotah from 1889 to 1940, was an avid game hunter. When he ordered the vehicle, we had it made with taller tires, searchlights front and rear, and gun racks. The car, which was originally painted . grey, is powered by an 8.0-litre six-cylinder engine and tows a .45 . calibre hand-cranked machine gun. A double barrel pistol hangs from the side, and there is an elephant gun mounted on the rear bumper. The colour change could be a reason the maharaja’s ride isn’t expected to fetch more than $1 million, according to Wired.com.

"A mentally disabled Connecticut high school student has been charged with sexually assaulting a disabled fellow student in a school bathroom as classmates cheered him on, according to police and court documents. Patrick Nolan, 19, was arraigned on Wednesday in Bridgeport Superior Court and charged with felony sexual assault and risk of injury to a child for the August 2013 attack on a male 16-year-old classmate at Harding High School, police said. An attorney for Nolan, Mark Phillips, said his client is 'profoundly retarded' and the unnamed classmates and teacher's aides who should have been supervising his client are to blame. HORROR:  A 'profoundly retarded' high school student has been charged with sexually assaulting a disabled male student in a bathroom as classmates cheered him on. Patrick Nolan, 19, was charged with felony sexual assault and risk of injury to a child for the August 2013 attack at Harding High School, pictured. An attorney for Nolan claims the unidentified group who instigated and egged on the attack are to blame and Nolan is a victim . An affidavit filed in the case painted a horrific scene of the incident drawn from details from a school surveillance video outside the bathroom and a student recording of the attack. In the videos, a student shouts 'keep going' while the victim is being sexually assaulted from behind, and afterward students are huddled together seemingly watching the cell phone recording, court documents stated. The footage also showed a group of students clapping after the victim passes in front of the camera, according to the affidavit. '(He) was having fun with my butt, asked me to pull my pants down and tries putting his private area into my butt. He pulls his pants down and starts like getting all nasty and everything. ... He was taking me from behind,' the victim said to detectives in an interview. Nolan's attorney, Mark Phillips, said the students who filmed the incident were instigators and were not disabled themselves. 'This was not some sociopath going into a high school at the age of 19 and raping a special needs kid,' Phillips said. 'This is something where able-minded students took advantage of these special education students.' The students have not been identified and the school officials claim they do not know who they are. The attack happened on the second day of school last year. The incident was investigated after the victim's mother made a complaint. 'This boy (Nolan) is profoundly retarded, and this is lost on the depiction of the situation,' Phillips told the Connecticut Post. 'Able-minded students got these two special-education students into the bathroom and then egged them on into a situation and filmed it. They are the criminals.' According to the Post, special needs students are not allowed to go the bathroom unaccompanied. 'An aide or teacher allowed special-needs kids to go to the bathroom by themselves, which is against school policy,' Phillips told the Post. Nolan was released by the court and ordered to return for a plea entry hearing on July 15. The Bridgeport Public School District declined comment on Thursday. A spokesman for the Connecticut Department of Child and Families said the agency was barred by state law from providing additional information on the case.","Patrick Nolan, 19, has been charged with the sex attack of a male special ed classmate, 16, in a school bathroom at Harding High in Connecticut .

Leading meteorologists and scientists will discuss one key issue: is Britain's often terrible weather down to climate change, or just typical? Scroll down for video . Wintry: A blanket of snow covers Teesdale in County Durham on the first . Bank Holiday in May this year, an event which has helped spark a Met . Office summit . It follows the coldest spring in more than 50 years, as well as droughts and floods in 2012, the freezing winter of 2010 and incredibly widespread snow last month. Experts will travel to the forecaster's . headquarters in Exeter on Tuesday for the meeting. Attendees are expected to debate whether the changing . weather pattern in the UK, and in northern Europe, is because of climate . change or simply variable weather. 'We have seen a run of unusual seasons in the UK and northern . Europe, such as the cold winter of 2010, last year's wet weather and the . cold spring this year,' a Met Office spokesman told the . Guardian. 'This may be nothing more than a run of . natural variability, but there may be other factors impacting our . weather. 'There is emerging research which suggests there is a link . between declining Arctic sea ice and European climate - but exactly how . this process might work and how important it may be among a host of . other factors remains unclear.' Digging out: Britain's winters have been particularly extreme, with most areas of the UK being hit with heavy snow at some point since 2010 . Wet Christmas: Despite being taken on December 27 2012, this picture of The Rose and Crown pub near Worcester shows the warm wet conditions the UK will suffer . Experts will identify what further . research is needed and discuss whether climate models need to be revised . to take into account any recent changes to weather patterns . It comes . after the National Farmers' Union reported that wheat harvests are . likely to be around 30 per cent lower than last year as a result of the extreme . weather. Earlier this month the Met Office said below average . temperatures throughout March, April and May made it the fifth coldest . spring in national records dating back to 1910 and the coldest spring . since 1962. March was 'exceptionally' cold, averaging 2.2°C. In more bad news, this week forecasters warned unsettled and wet conditions could last until the end of July and into August. Scorched: This picture of Hyde Park in the summer of 2010 shows how dry the UK summer can be . The last two weeks of warmer, clear days have been replaced by erratic conditions, including rain and high winds of up to 40mph, interspersed with pockets of warm, sunny and dry periods. Forecasters have attributed the unpredictable stretch - which is being caused by a south shifting jet stream - to just another 'typical British summer'. The 'blink and you'd miss it summer' is the latest in six months of unsettled weather, including a particularly bitter winter, and unseasonably cold Spring - which saw the coldest Easter Sunday on record. Extreme rain: This graph shows that since the 1960s there has been more and more days of torrential rain a year in Britain . Wet spots: This map of Britain shows where the the highest levels of torrential rain in 24 hours tends to fall . Jet streams are belts of fast flowing, narrow air currents found in the atmosphere, formed near air masses with significantly different temperatures. They are responsible for moving weather around the latitudes. The Polar jet stream, which is the most northerly jet stream, affects the UK, and tends to be further south in the winter and further north in the summer. But it has been sitting further south than is normal for this time of year, which is why the UK looks set to experience a wet summer.","Met Office has called extreme weather meeting for next week .

"Saudi Arabia's women have taken a step towards greater equality after they were appointed to a fifth of the seats on the government's advisory council. King Abdullah announced last year that women would join the unelected Shura Council which acts like a parliament but without formal powers. Today he appointed women to 20 per cent of the 150-member body as he reconstituted the council for a new four-year term. King Abdullah has fulfilled his pledge to appoint women to a fifth of the seats in his advisory council . Although the women can attend the assembly, they must enter through a different door and will be separated from their males colleagues by a screen. They will join the debate via an internal communication system. Segregation between men and women in the . oil rich country is widespread due to the ultra-conservative Wahhabi sharia . law. Restrictions mean they are not allowed to . drive, they must use separate entrances at banks and offices, and a plan . to build a city for female workers only has been announced. The Shura Council acts like a parliament but has no formal powers . From 2015 it was announced by the king . that women will be able to stand in the country’s municipal elections, . and while this move has been praised by the human rights groups, . restrictions will still apply to women. Women are still greatly restricted in Saudi Arabian society and need permission from their husband or a male relative to work, study, travel or marry . Due to the guardianship system, it . means women will need permission from a male relative or their husband . to work, travel, study or marry. Their testimony counts for less than that of a man in a court of law. A grassroots movement to secure women . the right to drive resulted in the campaign’s leader being jailed . briefly after posting a video on the internet showing her behind the . wheel of a car. The ruling al-Saud family controls most top government posts in the world's top oil exporter. The king appoints the cabinet. The only elections are for municipal councils that wield little power. The Shura Council, composed mostly of academics, clerics, businessmen and former civil servants, vets legislation, recommending changes or additions to the government. In his 2011 decree, King Abdullah also said women would be able to vote and stand for office in the municipal polls. Liberals in the Gulf Arab state say Abdullah, who became king in 2005 after effectively ruling as crown prince for a decade before that, has pushed for modest social change, calling for women to have more opportunities to work. Powerful conservative Sunni Muslim clerics have sometimes argued against allowing women a role in politics. To comply with the kingdom's rigorous policy of gender segregation, the Shura council building must now be altered to include a separate entrance for women, the decree said.","30 women chosen to join 150-member body which advises government .

"The newly opened National September 11 Memorial Museum in New York City was forced to remove a commemorative cheese plate from its gift shop after receiving complaints from the victims’ relatives. The objectionable souvenir was a decorative ceramic platter in the shape of the United States, with heart symbols marking the spots where the hijacked planes struck on 9/11: downtown Manhattan, the Pentagon and a field in rural Pennsylvania. Memorial Foundation President Joe Daniels told the Wall Street Journal the museum will enlist more help of 9/11 family members who sit on the foundation's board in vetting the merchandise. Cheesy gift: National September 11 Memorial Museum's gift shop decided to remove from its shelves a decorative cheese platter in the shape of the United States, with heart symbols marking the spots where the hijacked planes struck on 9/11 . Angered: Many 9/11 survivors and victims are upset that a gift shop is part of the new museum and memorial at the Ground Zero site . Merchandise: The gift shops a wide variety of souvenirs, including NYPD dog vests and earrings . Damage control: The head of the memorial foundation has vowed to enlist the help of 9/11 family members to help vet the gift shop merchandise . According to Daniels, the gift shop is needed to help support the operations of the museum, which opened its doors to the public last Wednesday following a ceremony attended by President Barack Obama. Mr Daniels pointed out to Wall Street Journal that many visitors want to take home a keepsake to remember the experience. The museum gift shop, which also operates an online store, offers a wide variety of souvenirs, including mugs, keychains, hooded sweatshirts and plush search-and-rescue dogs. The very idea of a shop peddling 9/11-themed knickknacks, most of them made overseas, has been the subject of a heated public debate. Since the grand opening of the memorial, survivors of the tragedy and family members of the fallen have lambasted the idea of hawking merchandise for profit so close to the site's hallowed ground. Some 8,000 human remains belonging to unidentified victims of the attack had been entombed in the bedrock beneath the exhibition space. ‘It's hard for me to accept that all of those things are in the same place where the remains are,’ said Rosaleen Tallon, who lost her firefighter brother on 9/11. Courting controversy: Since the grand opening of the memorial, family members of the fallen have lambasted the idea of selling merchandise for profit so close to hallowed ground . According to the museum's website, the proceeds from gift shop sales benefit 'developing and sustaining' the memorial, which is headed by executives who earn privately-funded six-figure salaries. The museum plans to operate on a $63million budget with money raised through admission fees and donations. The gift shop was funded with a $5million donation from Paul Napoli and Marc Bern, partners in a law firm which made $200,0000 representing 10,000 Ground Zero workers in a lawsuit.

"On trial: A Muslim woman has been told she will have to lift her veil if she wants to give evidence while on trial for witness intimidation . A woman made legal history yesterday as she stood trial in a full face veil. Rebekah Dawson, 22, became the first defendant to wear the covering at court after a judge ruled ‘freedom of religious expression’ should be recognised. District Judge Peter Murphy told jurors that Dawson had a right to wear a niqab during the trial but that she would have to remove it if she wanted to give evidence. He ruled: ‘The courts must respect and protect religious rights as far as that can possibly be done. ‘But in my view, it is necessary to the working of the crown court in a democratic society for the court, not the defendant to control the conduct of judicial proceedings.’ At Blackfriars Crown Court yesterday, Dawson argued that forcing her to remove the veil to give evidence violated her right to a fair trial under the European Convention on Human Rights. But Judge Murphy rejected the application, saying that jurors being unable to see her was contrary to the principle of open justice which overrides religious belief. He invited the defendant to remove the garment, but after a brief adjournment Dawson returned to court still wearing her niqab. Judge Murphy told jurors: ‘I am aware . some people have certain feelings about it [the niqab], but if you have . any feelings you must put them aside completely...  She is perfectly . entitled in this country to dress as she wishes.’ Accused: The woman pictured arriving at Blackfriars Crown Court in central London . He . added: ‘The courts have for many years, indeed centuries, ruled that . when a jury have been asked to evaluate evidence a witness gives it is . important for jurors to see them … It is not possible to do that if they . cannot see the witness’ face.’ Dawson, . and her brother Matthias, 32, are accused of threatening a caretaker at . Finsbury Park Mosque, north London, after he let three female charity . workers from Portugal – who were not wearing veils – enter the building . on June 4 last year. Dawson, . of Hackney, east London, and her brother Matthias Dawson, of Sydenham, . south-east London, deny a single charge of witness intimidation. The trial continues.

"This photo shows the horrific injuries a Sikh woman suffered after being attacked by her father-in-law because he thought she was having an affair with a Muslim man. Jageer Mirgind was left blind and scarred for life after 51-year-old Manjit Mirgind slashed her wrists and stabbed her in the eyes screaming 'I am going to kill you'. Mrs Mirgind’s children, just three and six years old, watched the horrific attack at their mother's home in Kensington Gardens, Ilford, East London, and pleaded with their grandfather to stop. Jageer Mirgind was left blind and scarred for life after Manjit Mirgind, 51, slashed her wrists and stabbed her in the eyes screaming 'I am going to kill you' after wrongly believing she was having an affair with a Muslim . Father-of-four Mirgind, 51, (pictured) stared at the floor as he was jailed for ten years and eight months at Snaresbrook Crown Court today for attacking his daughter-in-law at their home in Ilford, East London . The mother has been left . partially-sighted in both eyes while the children can no longer sleep . alone and have recurring nightmares. The crazed attacker wrongly believed his . daughter-in-law was 'sleeping with a Paki' and that she had 'ruined his . family', Snaresbrook Crown Court heard. Tragically, Mirgind misunderstood the situation when his daughter was the victim of a series of prank calls. After punching her in the face he dragged her into the kitchen where he savagely kicked her before grabbing a knife. He eventually left and went home as his wife called an ambulance for Mrs Mirgind. He later turned himself in at the police station and told them exactly what had happened. Judge Nigel Peters QC said: 'You have accepted that you have caused the most serious injuries to your daughter in law. 'You . set about her having taken umbrage because you felt she was having . affairs when it turned out she had been receiving prank calls. 'You . set out with great hostility and vengeance - you punched her, forced to . the ground and kicked her and took knives to her face and wrist to . gouge her eyes. 'She has since lost a lot of sight in both eyes and there is major scarring to her face. The attack occurred at the victim's home in Kensington Gardens, Ilford, but she has since moved to Nottingham . 'She has a stutter as well, most likely caused by the loss of confidence and lack of sleep and general work. 'So . distressing was that her children, your grandchildren, witnessed it . from start to finish and pleaded with you to stop but you did not stop.' Father-of-four Mirgind stared at the floor as he was jailed for ten years and eight months at Snaresbrook Crown Court. Crown lawyer Jonathan Turner said Mrs Mirgind's children had suffered, having begged the defendant to stop and they saw the blood everywhere. ‘Their life has changed and they cannot sleep alone while the marriage of their parents has disintegrated.’ Mrs Mirgind has since moved to Nottingham with her two children. The court heard the defendant Mirgind had been a leading member of the Sikh community and often drove young worshippers to the temple. In a statement read out to Snaresbrook Crown Court, pictured, Mirgind said he was 'stressed out' at the time . In . a statement read by his lawyer Edward Boateng-Addo, he said: ‘I am a . hard-working family man who left his job to care for his ill mother . seven years ago. ‘I was stressed out at the time and nothing can excuse what I did. ‘I . was trying to protect her - I am a peaceful and honest man and I know I . will not have the chance to apologise but I do look to the court to say . how sorry I am. He . had initially been charged with attempted murder but prosecutors later . accepted a plea of causing grievous bodily harm with intent in order to . avoid having to go to trial. Mirgind, of Mayfair Avenue, Ilford, admitted causing grievous bodily harm with intent. A single count of attempted murder has been left to lie on the court file.","Jageer Mirgind's eyes gouged with knife and wrists slashed in violent assault .

"With its arms outstretched, claws bared and mouth gaping open, this black tiger cub believes it is a fearsome sight - but the act isn't fooling anyone. The adorable 25-day-old feline was photographed playfully rolling around on a red carpet in the city of Hangzhou, in Zhejiang province of east China. During the photo-shoot, the cub was also pictured prancing around the room - with photos of cartoon animals, including a lion, adorning the walls. Scroll down for video . Too cute to fool anyone: The rare tiny black tiger cub does its best to look scary for the camera . At one point the cute infant is even seen huddled up to a confused-looking dog, as the animal acts milk-nurse for the cub. As a black tiger, it is not a unique subspecies - its unusual appearance is the result of pseudo-melanism. This occurs where the animal has a black or very dark grey pigmentation of their base coat with light tan or grey stripes. The thick stripes are so close together that they become barely visible - giving the appearance of one dark fur tone. What about now? The cute feline tries out another pose during the photo-shoot in Hangzhou,  eastern China . One for the cat-alogue: The cub is pictured in front of a wall of cartoon animals including a lion . Milk-nurse: The cub was even photographed cuddled up to a confused-looking dog as it fed from the animal . Sadly, it is thought that black tigers are actually becoming more common as a result of in-breeding - which causes weakening of healthy genetics. The term pseudo-melanism derives from pure melanism  - where an animal has a large amount of black pigmentation of the fur and eyes. This gives it a completely black appearance and is the opposite of albinism. All-black: The cub is not a unique subspecies - its unusual appearance is the result of pseudo-melanism .

"Hundreds of men, women and children fight to get to the front of the queue as a refugee camp in Damascus receives food parcels after being cut off for months. Today the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) called on rebel forces and Al-Assad’s troops alike to allow ‘safe and unhindered humanitarian access’ to thousands of civilians in Yarmouk, a Palestinian district in the Syrian capital. Yarmouk has seen some of the worst fighting in the capital, leading to severe food shortages and widespread hunger. Scroll down for video . Hour of need: Residents of Syria's besieged Yarmuk Palestinian refugee camp, south of Damascus, crowding a destroyed street during a food distribution led by the UN agency . Never ending plight: The 'Yarmouk Camp' is a district of Damascus populated by more than 112,000 Palestinian refugees, who are now starving to death . Desperate need: A sick young woman is queuing up for a food parcel and medical assistance alongside her family in Yarmouk . UNWRA chief Chris Gunnes spoke today . after a rare visit to Yarmouk on Monday where relief agencies have found . it particularly difficult to provide food and medical assistance. The Yarmouk Camp is a 0.8sq.mi. district of Damascus populated by more than 112,000 Palestinian refugees, who are mainly cut off from any foreign help. Yarmouk . Camp has been sealed since July 2013, resulting in acute and widespread . deprivation, including severe malnutrition, while civilian residents . are constantly exposed to the threat of death, injuries and trauma of . the armed conflict. The UN was given access to the camp by the Syrian authorities late January, which is when the photograph was taken. However, . following clashes in northern Yarmouk earlier this month, UNRWA said . distribution of food parcels and medical supplies may be suspended yet . again. Christopher Gunness, . from UNRWA, said: ‘It is impossible not to be touched by the . apocalyptic scenes emerging from the Palestinian refugee camp of Yarmouk . in Damascus, besieged and cut off for months. Long wait: Children await UN food parcels in Yarmouk, Damascus during a relief operation led by the UN agency for Palestinian refugees UNRWA . Any help will do: The Palestinian district of Damascus has been sealed on and off since July last year and has been subjected to heavy fighting during the war in Syria . Saviours: Staff from the UN agency for Palestinian refugees UNRWA has resumed distribution of desperately needed food and medicine . Helping hands: Sick and starving Palestinian residents hope to get a spot on ambulances provided by UNRWA . ‘The . images are at once epic and personal. Row upon row of gaunt faces, . serried ranks of grimy, raged figures; the delicate, hunger-ravaged . features of children waiting in line for an UNRWA food parcel; the face . of a mother creased in grief for a deceased child; tears of joy as a . father is reunited with a long-lost daughter. 'These are the vignettes of . inhumanity that have become the regular fare of nightly news bulletins. They are UNRWA's daily reality.’ The reports of humanitarian crisis came as more than 175 rebels and foreign fighters, including ‘Saudis, Qataris and Chechens,’ were killed Wednesday in a Syrian army ambush near Damascus, state news agency SANA reported. It said an army unit ‘spotted Al-Nusra Front (jihadist) and Liwa al-Islam (Islamist) terrorists’ near Damascus, and ‘killed 175 of them and wounded several others.’ Yesterday . the UN’s High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres warned that . Syrians could soon overtake Afghans as the world's biggest refugee . population. Hardship: The UN has warned that Syrians could soon overtake Afghans as the world's biggest refugee population, expecting to break the four million barrier by the end of 2014 . Starving: During a brief period of access between late January and last week, over 7,700 food baskets were been distributed and 3,400 people with medical conditions were evacuated from Yarmouk . No aid: Following months of starvation and battle, Palestinian residents wait for a United Nations aid ambulance in Yarmouk, Damascus . The organisation is predicting that the number of displaced Syrians will pass four million by the end of 2014. Opposition activists say more than 140,000 people have died in the conflict, which enters its fourth year next month. The U.N. says 9.3 million Syrians are in need of humanitarian assistance.The number of Afghan refugees was 2.6 million at the end of 2012, UNHCR says. Syrians, . with nearly 2.5 million registered as refugees, should overtake that . long before the end of the year. About one-half of the refugees are . children. ‘It breaks my . heart to see this nation that for decades welcomed refugees from other . countries ripped apart and forced into exile itself,’ Guterres told the . U.N. General Assembly. Just five years ago, Syria hosted the world's . second-largest number of refugees, he said. Syria's neighbors now plead for assistance as hundreds or thousands of people flee into their countries every day. The . number of Syrian refugees now registered in far smaller Lebanon, for . example, is the equivalent of having 71 million of them registered in . the United States or almost 15 million in France, Guterres said.","Yarmouk, the Palestinian area of Damascus has been sealed to the outside world on and off since July .

"In a land where they are despised, feared and even hunted for their body parts, the albinos of Tanzania have found a refuge that offers them a glimmer of hope for the future. The Kabanaga Protectorate Centre in the town of Kabanaga in the north-west of the East African country, close to the Burundi border, caters to the nation's albinos, who are known as the 'tribe of ghosts', 'zeros' or 'the invisibles'. They have suffered appalling treatment at the hands of their own neighbours and are murdered for their body parts, which are believed to bring good fortune and cure all manner of ills. Surrogate: Lightness Philbert, who doesn't know her age and was abandoned at the Kabanga Protectorate Center, in Kabanga, Tanzania, nurses a baby who was brought by there by her mother . Bright future: Yonge, four, closes her eyes against the bright sunlight. Albinism also affects her eyes with light sensitivity and low vision. The child was abandoned by her parents . Associated Press staff photojournalist Jacquelyn Martin, . based in Washington in the U.S, visited the centre to chronicle those who . are treated with fear and contempt for a simple genetic fluke. 'The children break your heart,' says Jacquelyn, who travelled to the centre as part of the personal project. 'Especially the ones who have been abandoned - They are uniquely beautiful people.' The 70-or-so albinos, who range in age from newborns to sexagenarians, are at the centre for a combination of factors. Sometimes the parents are afraid of . their children, sometimes they are forced to give up their beloved . offspring because they fear the prejudices of the people in their own . community. 'Despite everything they've been . through and what they are probably going to have to face in the future,' says Jacquelyn. 'They really wanted to go back to their villages and live a normal life. 'There's a sense of community in the centre, where older people take care of the babies and younger children.' Joy in the face of prejudice: Girls chatter playfully by a small store just outside the gates of the Kabanga Protectorate Center . Epifania 'Happiness' Ezra, 16, poses for a portrait in Matiazo Village, Tanzania. She has only ever met one other person with albinism in her life . Albinism is a genetic condition characterised by a deficiency of melanin pigmentation in the skin, hair and eyes which protects from the sun's ultraviolet rays. In many African nations - but most commonly in Tanzania - albinos are butchered in the street. Their remains are used in the macabre human potions used by traditional healers to treat the sick . Believing it will bring them good luck and big catches, fishermen on the shores Lake Victoria weave albino hair into nets. Bones are ground down and buried in the earth by miners, who believe they will be transformed into diamonds. The genitals are also sometimes made into treatments to boost sexual potency. One of the albinos is 17-year-old Angel, who was visited by her mother from a remote and poor part of the country for the first time in four years. When she was born her father called her 'a gift from God'. But his joy was not that of a new . father - he wanted to butcher the girl and sell her body parts for . thousands of dollars, a fortune to the average family in Tanzania . Angel's . mother was filled with love for her daughter and managed to deter the . father for years, but when Angel was 13 he led a group to attack her. Angel got away, but her mother's own parents were killed in the attack as they fought to protect their granddaughter. But Jacquelyn says she will never escape the prejudice that follows her wherever she goes. 'There's . a market close to the centre and the women went together in a group as a . safety measure because it's harder to kidnap someone in a group,' says Jacquelyn. 'Angel was in a shop and the woman behind the counter couldn't  look her in the eyes. 'She just took her money. That was something that struck me.' Ignorance . about the condition is rife - there is even a belief that their mothers . slept with white men to give them the condition. 'Sometimes it's less about beliefs than pure economics,' says Jacquelyn. '[But] there was this note of strength in all of the ones I met; all of them had hopes for something greater.' 'One wanted to be a politician to help . other albinos, another wanted to be a lawyer to fight for their rights, . one wanted to be a teacher to educate people about the condition and . another wanted to be a journalist to report about people with albinism.' But it is a long and steep slope to . climb before Tanzania truly wakes up to the terrible plight that faces . each albino born into this world. In February attackers collecting body . parts of albinos for witchcraft hacked off the hand of a seven-year-old . boy, officials said. The boy, called Mwigulu Magessa, was ambushed by the men as he walked home with his . friends in Tanzania. He survived but many such victims of ignorance are not so lucky. Just days earlier an albino mother of . four had her arm chopped off by machete-wielding men and a month before . that an albino child died in Tanzania's Tabora region after attackers . hacked off his arm.' Tribe of ghosts: Eumen Ezekiel, 13, was attacked in 2007 and hasn't seen his mother since. 'I want to be a member of parliament and defend others living with albinism,' he said . Zainab, 12, left, stands in a doorway at the Kabanga Protectorate Center, in Kabanga, Tanzania. Zainab and other children and adults have been placed in centres to protect them from being hunted for their body parts . There is very little being done by the government other than putting them in centres to ensure their safety,' Jacquelyn adds. 'They are just sweeping them under the rug, there isn't a long-term solution. 'It was hard to leave the children in . this situation and I hope my photography has put a human face on the . issue and I hope they see themselves as I see them - beautiful people . who deserve a chance in life.' Jacquelyn collaborated with the non-profit organisation Asante Mariamu . during her trip to the centre, which is housed in the Kabanga Primary School, a government boarding school for disabled children. The organisation is dedicated to raising awareness about the ongoing . human rights crisis impacting people with albinism in East Africa. They . seek to teach people with albinism about the condition, so that they . can better understand how to protect themselves from skin cancer. They also work to dispel the myths surrounding the condition to increase acceptance in society. Providing . direct relief with sun protective gear and sunscreen, Asante Mariamu . also seeks to empower people with albinism by providing opportunities . for education so that they can become vital and valuable members of . society.

"The CIA believes Edward Snowden may have been recruited by the Russians as long as seven years ago and could have passed on a ‘treasure trove’ of secrets. The US intelligence agency is investigating whether the fugitive, now living in Moscow, betrayed his country by working for the Putin regime as a double agent as early as 2007.

Baer said he had been told by contacts at the CIA that they were . carrying out a ‘damage assessment’ into whether Snowden handed sensitive . information to the Russians. ‘They . are looking at the possibility that information was passed on,’ he . said. ‘It’s a damage assessment – clearly what he saw in Geneva has to . be looked at and it has to be assumed that he passed it on to Russia.’ Disillusioned: Snowden claims he was motivated to act after managers failed to listen when he raised concerns about the NSA's surveillance . Homesick: Snowden says he would like to return to the U.S. and doesn't believe he deserves to be jailed . From . 2007 to 2009, Snowden was posted to Geneva, where he worked as a . ‘communicator’, looking through intelligence reports and passing them on . to headquarters in Langley, Virginia. He . was so trusted during this time that he was chosen to provide President . Obama with support at the 2008 Nato summit in Romania. But Mr Baer said he could have ‘betrayed’ his country by passing information to Moscow. ‘You’d . be seeing the intelligence briefings that Geneva would get. You’d also . be getting NSA reports. That’s the sort of regular stuff he’d be getting . across his desk. ‘He was a disaster there. As a communicator he will have seen everything.’ Snowden could also have seen information sent by British intelligence, Mr Baer said. ‘There’s . a daily intelligence briefing which gives you a summary of chatter and . intercepts and diplomatic communication. He could have easily given it . to Russia. I think it is just horrendous.’ Robert Baer says Edward Snowden's actions have hugely damaged U.S. and UK intelligence gathering . Snowden fled to Russia after a brief spell in Hong Kong during which he was expected to seek asylum in a South American state. But . Mr Baer said he suspected the stopover in the Far East had been part of . a deliberate ploy to muddy the waters. ‘Why did he not get a plane to . South America in the first place? None of it stands up. It looks like a . recruitment operation.’ Speaking . earlier on BBC Radio 4, Mr Baer said he believed Snowden should go to . jail for a long time, because letting such a high-profile whistleblower . go free would set a dangerous precedent. ‘If . you take that attitude with any whistleblower you’d have a really bad . problem,’ he said. ‘Could it lead to another catastrophe? I’d say yes. ‘That’s . a treasure trove that the Russians could use for years and years. They’re going to know all the parameters about our intercepts and GCHQ’s . as well.’ Denial: The Moscow-based NSA whistlebower says he is not working with the Russian government . Back in the limelight: NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden appeared in his first interview with mainstream American TV on Wednesday night . Mr Baer also derided Snowden’s claims in an NBC interview that he was a bona fide spy as ‘silly’. ‘I . think we all know by now he was a systems administrator,’ he said. ‘When he worked in Geneva, he was a communicator – that means he sits in . an office and relays messages back to Langley. That’s not a spy. ‘And . secondly the NSA doesn’t have spies overseas. It’s got technicians who . sit in American embassies and sort of listen to scanners. So I worry . about his common sense here. He has a Walter Mitty complex it seems to . me.’ Mr Baer said Snowden’s . actions would cost Western intelligence agencies billions of dollars as . they are forced to rebuild their communications systems.

"The last remaining full-body X-ray airport scanners are to be scrapped within weeks. The security systems, which have been tested at air terminals since 2009, scan through passengers’ clothes, creating a detailed ghost-like image of the naked body. The scan is then viewed by security staff. Critics said the machines invaded passengers’ privacy and the radiation they generate raised the risk of cancer. Some Muslim groups also refused to walk through them on religious grounds. Controversial: A demonstration of the scanners that European bosses have failed to give approval of. A full body scan is shown, left, and a screen showing the results of the scan, right . The European Commission ruled that . the cancer risk was ‘close to zero’ but, under Brussels legislation, the . three-year trial period has elapsed and it has decided not to . ‘prioritise’ them for permanent use across the continent. Airport bosses who were waiting for . the green light on the machines now say they have been left with no . option but to remove them. The scanners will be replaced with ‘privacy-friendly’ machines which use radio-frequency technology. Manchester airport, which is the last . in Britain to be still using ‘naked’ scanners, said it will now have to . spend £1.1million to replace them with the new devices. It will also have to hire dozens of extra security staff to frisk passengers manually. The airport’s chief operating officer . Andrew Harrison said: ‘We’re baffled by this situation because health . experts say they are safe, plus the overwhelming majority of our . passengers and security staff prefer body scanners to frisking. ‘It’s frustrating that Brussels has allowed this successful trial to end.’ American use: More than 600 Advanced Imaging Technology units, using X-ray technology, have been installed at 140 airports across the U.S . The report from the EC's Committee in May said radiation doses were 'very low' compared with other sources such as cosmic radiation received during flights. But it did add that the long-term effects, such as cancer risks, could not be 'entirely excluded'. American academic Dr David Brenner said he believed the scanner could deliver up to 20 times more radiation to the skin than previously thought - potentially increasing the risk of skin cancer. Fears were also raised that the scanners were an invasion of privacy and some passengers and religious groups had questioned their use. The scanners were introduced at Manchester airport in a security crackdown after incidents such as the attempted 'underwear bomb' terror plot in 2009. Passengers selected for scanning have, in the past, been banned from flying if they refuse to pass through the device. European Commission: EC chiefs have failed to give their approval for their full time use despite a report declaring the risk was 'close to zero' The airport said around 10 passengers were unable to board their flight after refusing to pass through the scanners, known as 'back scatter' machines. They were used at Heathrow but scrapped amid complaints about invasion of privacy. They have also been tested in Germany, France, Italy, Finland and Holland. Research has suggested that, despite the low radiation dosage, that because of the large number of scanners in the U.S., hundreds of passengers a year could get cancer. When there were 250 scanners in the U.S. last year, research suggested up to 100 passengers a year could get cancer. The passenger screening programme at airports in the U.S has had . frequent complaints that not all passengers are screened in the same . way. In reaction to this, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has . replaced the machines, which give a detailed outline of individuals' figures, for a more generic shape. On the updated machine, the passenger and the TSA worker both view the . image together which lights up on screen if it detects a problem. The need for a separate TSA officer viewing the image in another room is no longer required. The new images are said to be 'very generic' and 'focus on the privacy of the passenger'. The images of passengers are not stored or printed and cannot be . transmitted. They are deleted from the system once they have been . viewed. Those who fly are not required by law to pass through AIT screening - . but if they opt out, they will receive alternative screening, including a . physical pat-down. The TSA has continued to . defend the safety of the X-ray devices, saying they expose passengers to . the same radiation as two minutes on a flying plane. Earlier this year it was reported . that more than 600 Advanced Imaging Technology units, using X-ray . technology, have been installed at 140 airports across the U.S. The . first X-ray body scanner was developed in 1992 by Steven W Smith. He . sold the technology and rights to Rapiscan Systems, which now . manufactures and distributes the device. Fears . about the health risks were raised in the U.S. as far back as 1998 when . the machine known as the Secure 1000 was evaluated by a panel of . radiation safety experts brought together by the Food and Drug . Administration. They all expressed concerns about the machine because it violated a longstanding principle that humans should not be X-rayed unless there is a medical purpose. The machine’s inventor told panelists that the machine would most probably not be widely used for many years to come. Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam was the first airport to implement the scanners in 2007. In the U.S. the Transportation Security Administration scanners sparked a heated debate over security concerns versus travelers' privacy when they were first brought in in autumn 2010. The machines have also been installed in some courtrooms. In response, New Jersey's legislature issued a resolution urging Congress to review the programme. Study group Electronic Privacy Information Center then filed a lawsuit to suspend the use of scanners at U.S. airports pending an independent review. In February 2011, a trial of new 'non-intrusive' body scanners started at Atlanta, Las Vegas, and Washington, D.C. before they were rolled out permanently in July last yer. New York's Newark Liberty International airport followed in September last year, where more than eight million passengers boarded planes in 2010.","Scanners use X-ray technology to show up hidden explosives or weapons .

"Historic: What killed Richard the Lionheart? He succumbed to a mystery infection . More than eight centuries after he fell in battle, the mystery of what actually killed one of England's most famous kings could finally be solved. Richard the Lionheart succumbed to a mystery infection while being treated for a crossbow wound during a siege of a castle in France on April 6, 1199. But nobody has ever been able to work out what germ infected Richard’s bloodstream, so causing his death at the age of 42. Now Philippe Charlier, a leading forensics expert, is to examine a miniscule sample of the 12th Century king’s heart so as to identify the cause of his death 812 years ago. Dusty fragments of King Richard’s heart have been kept for centuries in Rouen Cathedral, in northern France. Mr Charlier said that chemical tests on just 'one or two milligrams' of the remains – just 1 per cent of the Rouen relic – will be enough to provide conclusive results, and they are likely to be ready in just three months’ time. 'It is a forensic challenge,' said Mr Charlier. 'We want to get the maximum information from the smallest possible sample.' Initial tests uncovered the presence of human cells, as well as 'vegetable, mineral and metal elements'. Forensics expert Philippe Charlier examining a skull. He is to examine a miniscule sample of the 12th Century king's heart to identify the cause of his death . It is thought that Richard I died of septicaemia, but this has never been proved. Mr Charlier also hopes to learn more about the embalming process on the King’s body, which would have been carried out by lowly servants. Caroline Dorion-Peyronnet, curator of Rouen's antiquities museum, has refused numerous requests for samples in the past – mainly by British people trying to prove family links with royalty. But she has now agreed to Mr Charlier's request as there will be 'no DNA tests'. Celebrated: A statue of Richard the Lionheart is in front of the Houses of Parliament . Mr Charlier, who is dubbed the 'Indiana Jones of the graveyards', previously helped put paid to claims that Napoleon Bonaparte was poisoned by his British captors. Richard I is one of the most popular kings in England history after leading  the Third Christian Crusade against Muslims who had captured Jerusalem in the 12th century. He failed to take the city because of inner-feuds between his Crusader allies, but scored numerous victories against Saladin, his Muslim counterpart. Despite his reputation in England, Richard spent most of his time in his lands in France, and mainly conversed in French dialects. Richard died after a crossbow bolt pierced his shoulder during a siege of the castle of Chalus-Chabrol in the Limousin region of France.","Philippe Charlier is described as the 'Indiana Jones of the graveyards'

"Jamie Reynolds who murdered Georgia Williams after luring her for a photo shoot at his parent's house . Police are to be investigated after their failure to stop an 'evil' murderer who went on to kill a teenage girl. West Mercia Police has asked for an investigation into their handling of a separate case before Jamie Reynolds went on to lure and kill 17-year-old Georgia Williams. The investigation is being carried out by Devon and Cornwall Police and will cover how West Mercia police handled all previous contact between Reynolds and Georgia. Reynolds is serving a life sentence after admitting murdering former head girl Georgia at his home in Wellington, Shropshire, in May last year. Mr Justice Alan Wilkie, sentencing the then 23-year-old at Stafford Crown Court in December 2013, told him he 'had the potential to progressing to become a serial killer'. It emerged in court Reynolds was handed a police caution in 2008, aged 17, for trying to strangle another teenage girl. Georgia’s father - a serving detective constable with the West Mercia force - told the judge at the time: 'We’ve been damned by evil to endure this sorrow and misery to the end of our natural lives.' In a statement, West Mercia Police said it had initially referred its previous contact with Reynolds to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) recommending an investigation be carried out in the interests of the public good. In March, the IPCC replied, informing the force to manage such an investigation locally. The statement went on: 'Our officers and staff strive to provide the best possible service to the public and it’s important to examine previous incidents involving Jamie Reynolds to ascertain the details of those investigations and whether they fell short of what is expected. Georgia was last seen by her family on May 26 2013 and reported her missing two days later . 'We take the concerns around these previous incidents very seriously and we strongly feel that it would be more appropriate for the investigation to be carried out by an alternative force. 'We have therefore asked Devon and Cornwall Police to conduct the enquiries.' It added that it was 'inappropriate for us to comment further around specific details' until the investigation had run its course. A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall Police confirmed it was investigating following West Mercia’s request. Reynolds was jailed for life in December last year after the judge heard he had the potential to go on and become a serial killer . Georgia was last seen by her family on May 26 2013 and reported her missing two days later. Reynolds had answered texts from the girl’s concerned parents, pretending to be Georgia in order to cover his tracks. He was arrested in Glasgow after dumping the teenager’s body in woodland at Nant-y-Garth pass in north Wales. It emerged Reynolds had what prosecutors in the court case labelled a 'morbid fascination' with images of extreme sexual violence. West Mercia Police has asked Devon and Cornwall Police to investigate a previous attack by Jamie Reynolds pictured with Georgia Williams . After his arrest, detectives found 16,800 images and 72 videos of extreme pornography on his computer. Some of the images were doctored pictures of girls and women he knew, with ropes digitally drawn around their necks. He had penned up to 40 short stories with graphic descriptions of sexual violence against women and had also written a script detailing a girl’s murder. Reynolds lured the defenceless teenager to his parents’ house just a few hundred yards from where she lived on the pretence of a photo-shoot before trapping and killing her. The . twisted shop worker lured her to his home where he hanged . her from a noose before performing sexual acts on her dead body. He even set up a homemade gallows made from an upturned red recycling box beneath a rope which was attached to the loft hatch. After . taking a series of innocent pictures of the teenager, Reynolds . persuaded her to stand on the box with the rope around her neck. He then bound Georgia’s hands together before kicking the box away causing the pretty teenage RAF cadet to asphyxiate. After . she died, Reynolds - who hoarded hardcore ‘snuff’ movies featuring . sexual killings - stripped Georgia and abused her lifeless body. At the time Mr Williams, 55, spoke about how he and his wife were receiving counselling to help them cope with Georgia’s death. Georgia Williams . 2008: Jamie Reynolds, then 17, is reported to police after luring a girl back to his house with an offer of a photo shoot before trying to strangle her. He is let off with a caution. Later, Reynolds' stepfather goes to the police with pictures from the boy's hard drive. They feature girls with nooses superimposed around their necks and pornographic images of a man raping and strangling a girl to death. No action is taken. Sunday May 26 2013: Georgia is last seen by her parents at 7.30pm as she leaves the family home in Wellington, Shropshire. She tells them she is going to stay with friends. In fact she went to Reynolds' home where he persuaded her to climb onto a box and place her head in a noose for a picture, before kicking the box away and hanging her. He then took several pictures of her dead body, both clothed and unclothed, before carrying out a sexual assault. Tuesday May 28: Georgia is reported missing by her parents after it emerges she has not stayed with friends. Police arrive in the morning to a semi-detached house in Avondale Road, Wellington, and, according to a neighbour, break down the door to get inside. Neighbours say a Jamie Reynolds lives at the address with his parents. Wednesday May 29: Reynolds is arrested in a budget hotel in Glasgow city centre by officers from Police Scotland on suspicion of kidnapping Georgia. They also seize a Toyota van which Reynolds used to transport Georgia's body to woodlands where he dumped it, before heading north. CCTV will later show he visited an Odeon cinema in Wrexham while her body was still inside. Thursday May 30: West Mercia Police say the suspect has been arrested on suspicion of murder following 'developments in the investigation'. They stress that Georgia has still not been found. Friday May 31: Police confirm it came to light yesterday that Georgia died at an address in Wellington, Telford. The body of a young female found in woodland on the Nant-y-Grath pass, in north Wales, is believed to be linked to Georgia's disappearance. It is later confirmed to be the teenager. Jamie Reynolds, 22, is charged with her murder. December 2: Reynolds pleads guilty to murder at Stafford Crown Court . Mr Justice Wilkie remands Reynolds in custody until December 19 pending further psychiatric reports. December 19: Reynolds is handed a full life sentence for Georgia's murder after the judge hears he had the potential to go on and become a serial killer. He is only the 50th person in British legal history to be given such a sentence. In court it emerges that Reynolds began hunting for clips of women being strangled six years before the attack. When he was arrested police found 16,800 images and 72 videos of extreme pornography on his computer. It is also revealed that he subscribed to the same 'snuff' website as Lostprophets singer Ian Watkins, featuring videos of murder pornography.

"Four out of 10 infants born in the United States do not form a strong bond with either parent, and they will pay for that the rest of their lives, a new study has found. Research from Princeton University has shown the number of babies born into families that are poorly equipped to give them a fair chance at having a successful life is alarmingly high. Additionally, a study from the University of Rochester showing that nearly one-third of U.S. parents don't know what to expect from their newborns, or how to help them grow and learn and get along with others. The main problem, according to the Princeton study, is 40 percent of infants in the U.S. 'live in fear or distrust of their parents', and that will translate into aggressiveness, defiance and hyperactivity as they grow into adults. It's bonding time: A new study says not enough parents are properly bonding with their babies, which creates greater problems later in life. However researchers say basic bonding is simple . Of that number, 25 percent don't bond with their parents because the parents aren't responding to their needs. Some 15 percent find their parents so distressing that they will avoid them whenever possible. 'They can overcome it,' sociologist Sophie Moullin of Princeton, lead author of that study, told ABC News. 'It's not a make or break situation, but they might find it harder to regulate their behavior.' Moullin, along with coauthors from Columbia University and the University of Bristol in England, analyzed more than 100 research projects, including data collected by a U.S. longitudinal study of 14,000 children born in 2001, to reach their conclusions. While many factors contribute to the problem - including poverty, ignorance, and stress - critical bonding is simple to achieve, researchers say. 'When a parent, most of the time, responds to a child in a warm, sensitive and responsive way - picking up the child when they cry, and holding and reassuring them - the child feels secure that they can meet their needs,' the study notes. Other research shows that simply touching, or caressing, a newborn is critical to the infant's sense of security. The study also says that the bond can be with either parent, not necessarily both, but studies of childhood crime and risky behavior contend that for boys, the bond is more important with the father, and for girls, the bond is relatively more important with the mother. Mother's touch: Researcher's say that little things like sensitivity when picking up a crying child and even a soft touch makes the child feel secure . Nearly all of these studies are based on observation of children over an extended period of time. Researchers usually pay more attention to the child than the parent, because the lack of a bond is more apparent in the infant. One innovative technique is called the 'strange situation'. The parent leaves the baby with a caregiver for about 20 minutes, and then either the parent or a stranger reenters the room. The reaction to the returning parent, compared to the arrival of a stranger, tells volumes about the relationship between parent and child. If a failed relationship is detected, especially when the infant is six months old or younger, the chances of helping the parent and the child form a strong bond is greatly improved, the study notes. The fact that damage can begin that young should be sobering to parents. However, often the parents most in need of help are the least likely to seek it. Moullin said researchers in one study had observed 2-year-olds over several months and were able to predict which ones would have the most trouble years later in school, based on the child's level of poverty. The bond can be with either parent, but studies of childhood crime and risky behavior contend that the bond is more important with the father for boys, and for girls, the bond is relatively more important with the mother . Usually, it's the mother who is the central focus of studies like these, probably because the mom is the main caregiver, especially in the early years. But a study at the University of Iowa two years ago concluded that 'being attached to dad is just as helpful as being close to mom'. That is critical during the first two years of life. A similar study in 2012 from the Imperial College London found that fathers were especially important in helping the infant avoid behavioral problems later in life. If the father is remote or distracted, the child is more likely to be aggressive. This is a problem that is not going to go away, and some percentage of parents will never be able to do a decent job because of a wide variety of reasons. But what all these studies show is the importance of those first few months of life, when a tiny baby is sent on a trajectory that will partly determine success at something as simple - and as critical - as getting along with others.","New Princeton University research shows the importance of parental bonding in the long-run .

"A glamour model known as Sonya Milkshake who dated Rurik Jutting for four years has said: ‘It could have been me.’ Sonya Dyer, 29, was said to be distraught after learning he was suspected of mutilating two prostitutes. Miss Dyer, who posed for racy photoshoots while pouring banana milkshake over her cleavage, was one of two British women romanced by Jutting before he moved to Hong Kong in July last year. Scroll down for video . 'Sonya Milkshake': London-born glamour model Sonya Dyer dated British banker Rurik Jutting before he moved to Hong Kong. He has been accused of murdering two prostitutes at his flat in the former British colony . Racy: Ms Dyer has featured in a number of publications including men's 'urban glamour and lifestyle' magazine CandymagUK. She also appeared in a video for magazine pouring milkshake down her bikini . The other has been named as Goldman Sachs banker Sarah Butt, a privately educated former grammar school student who worked with Jutting at Barclays. Miss Butt, 28, was said to have been his fiancee two years ago, but he was left heartbroken after their engagement was called off. Last night a friend of London-born Miss Dyer said the fashion model, who had lived with Jutting in Wapping, East London, was shocked. ‘She was in a relationship with him for over four years and they shared a flat. She thinks it could have been her. She’s feeling really confused,’ said the friend. ‘It was a serious relationship. They lived together although they never got engaged. He never ill-treated her. He never hit her or treated her with anything but respect. ‘That’s why Sonya is emotionally all over the place now. She can’t understand what happened.’ Ms Dyers is among a string of beautiful girls linked to the former public schoolboy's astonishing private life, including an British ex-fiancee who apparently left him 'devastated' after cheating on him. Today, it was revealed that Ms Dyer has featured in a number of racy publications including men's 'urban glamour and lifestyle' magazine CandymagUK - and posed provocatively in a bikini while pouring milkshake over herself and her cleavage. The fashion student appeared in a saucy video for the magazine in 2010 in which she dances provocatively before covering herself in smoothie. Speaking to the camera, she says: 'I'm currently on the set of my milkshake shoot. I've got the milkshake here. 'I'm wearing some sexy gear as well. Keeping it sexy, keeping it funky. 'I'm also going to be pouring some strawberry milkshake over me, so watch as I get dirty.'

In a video for the magazine (above) she posed provocatively in a bikini while pouring milkshake over face and her cleavage . Fashion student: Sonya Dyer, 29, once said to have described him as her 'hubby' However, in an accompanying interview, she said she was keen to show that models are not 'all slutty', adding that she wanted to change's people's perception of the industry. Ms Dyer, who was brought up in London by Jamaican parents, said: 'People have got the wrong impression about me but I think from doing this I might be able to change people's minds about models. 'It's important for me to be vocal about who I am, to show people that models aren't all slutty and we're not always at the club every night. 'You can be an intelligent, spiritual and well-rounded woman. And that's inspiring for other girls to look up to.' In a separate feature with Dream magazine, she told how she started modelling after a friend persuaded her that it would boost her confidence. Her modelling agent confirmed to reporters that she had been in a relationship with Jutting for several years and that it had ended 'recently'. She had roles in the 2008 film How To Lose Friends And Alienate People and the BBC1 drama Ashes To Ashes. Jutting is said to have gone skiing with Miss Dyer in 2013, making it unclear whether there was some overlap with his relationship with Miss Butt. Pictures of Ms Dyer with Jutting show the trader looking far slimmer than when he was arrested over the weekend. The agent was reportedly inviting bids for exclusive access to interview Ms Dyer. She was once said to have described Jutting as her 'hubby'. Asked about him at her flat in West London last night, she tearfully declined to comment. An acquaintance in the banking world recalled Jutting being distraught two years ago after his then-fiancée – a fellow British trader – cheated on him with another man. The woman, named by The Telegraph as Sarah Butt, 28, had met Jutting in 2010 when they were both working for Barclays in London. However, she reportedly had kissed another man after moving to New York from London to work for Goldman Sachs last year. Although the couple attempted to rekindle their romance - even getting engaged for a short time - Jutting struggled to get over the 'affair' and ended the relationship a short time later. The ex-girlfriend: Banker Rurik Jutting pictured with his former partner Ariane Guarin, also known as Yanie . Court date: A handcuffed Rurik Jutting is taken to a Hong Kong court by police car after being charged with the murders of the two women . Miss Butt was born in Bury, where her parents still live. One of three siblings, she attended £9,000-a-year Bury Grammar School and studied engineering at Imperial College London. She worked briefly at PricewaterhouseCoopers before joining Barclays Capital and then Goldman Sachs, spending about 12 months working in New York before returning to London, where she works as an associate on European special situations. Her main business is with clients who are ‘high net worth individuals’. Miss Butt, who was named by the Daily Telegraph, could not be traced for comment yesterday and there was no answer at her parents’ house. Goldman Sachs declined to comment. A City source told the paper that Jutting and Miss Butt ‘spent everything they made’ and described him as ‘preoccupied with power and money’. After leaving £34,000-a-year Winchester College, he graduated in 2008 from Peterhouse, Cambridge, where he studied law and history and was secretary of the university's history society. Friends speaking to the Evening Standard described Jutting as 'very sharp, very bright, and perceptive' and 'more a leader than a follower' while a pupil at the college. Out with the girls: Rurik Jutting was like a 'zombie' after his regular weekend drug binges, a former Hong Kong law enforcement office claimed today . Hanging out: After police were called to his apartment, Jutting was questioned before being driven away for further questioning, leaving a forensic team to examine the scene at his flat . Speaking anonymously, one said they assumed Jutting was looking for a job reference when his name appeared in the subject line of an email following his arrest on Saturday. 'If they had been looking for a reference, I'd have said: I wouldn't want to spend more than an hour in a room with him, but he was incredibly bright.' Another said of the schoolboy Jutting: 'He was more a leader than a follower. He wasn't assertive particularly, but was a bit over the top in his mannerisms. 'He was arrogant rather than aloof. He was quite pleased with himself.' A third Winchester contemporary added: 'I'd say he was - it may seem surprising - rather attractive. He had a sort of controlled poise and a certain understated smugness, a sort of superior air, but lightly worn. 'He seemed quite detached. I'd never have described him as affable.' Former schoolmates also spoke of their shock at seeing Jutting looking bloated in recent photographs - adding that they remember him as being 'slim, tanned and attractive.' Jutting later worked as a trader at Barclays Bank in London for two years before joining Merrill Lynch. In 2013, he moved to Merrill's Hong Kong office. He surrounded himself with beautiful Asian women and showed off his new life to friends back home in a series of online updates. Rurik Jutting at a Cambridge dinner in about 2002. He is reported to have earned a salary of £350,000 until he quit his job at Merrill Lynch . Rurik Jutting (fourth from left) is pictured with his rowing team at Peterhouse College, Cambridge . Many of the pictures he posted featured young mother Ariane Guarin from the Philippines – known to friends as Yanie. The couple uploaded photographs of themselves to their respective Facebook pages in July and August but appear to have broken up by early September. On September 20, a friend took to Jutting's Facebook page to say she missed the couple and wished they were still together. Miss Guarin had divided her time between looking after her children in a small town in the Philippines and partying with overweight Jutting, who called her his 'beautiful honey'. Miss Guarin, whose family live in Angono, a tiny town ten miles east of Philippine capital Manila, is seen wearing necklaces and rings in shots with Jutting and appeared to come into money, with friends asking her for loans on Facebook, where she boasted of building a new home in the Philippines. Such was their lavish lifestyle together, her friends compared the couple to Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie – known by the combined name 'Brangelina' – by calling Rurik and Yanie 'Ruyanie'.","London fashion student Sonya Dyer 'cut up' after learning of trader's arrest .

"Upset: Louise Allain, 41, wishes she had never taken the original job in Cherie Blair's office last year . She champions working mothers and preaches to bosses about their duty to adopt family-friendly policies. Cherie Blair, however, seems to have trouble with flexibility in her own office. The wife of the former prime minister was yesterday accused of ‘sheer hypocrisy’ after sacking a single mother who was unable to take on more hours. Louise Allain says she was made redundant after telling barrister Mrs Blair her childcare commitments meant she could not change her work from part time to full time. The 41-year-old suggested working some of the time from home or job sharing, but this was rejected. Last night, Miss Allain said that she felt ‘utterly betrayed’ by Mrs Blair, who she said had ‘thrown her on the scrap heap’ just for wanting to look after her children. She said: ‘I feel an utter sense of injustice. It’s sheer hypocrisy. How can she go from being a forward thinking boss who you couldn’t ask for more from to being so dispassionate and cold. ‘She had turned her back on me because I would not work full time. She is supposed to empower women, she goes around the world empowering women, but when it comes to a single woman on her own and struggling in her own office, she just says get lost.’ Miss Allain, who lives in Central London, was offered a job working in the personal office of Mrs Blair just over a year ago. The two met when her son was in the same class at school as Leo Blair. After the single mother-of-two confided in Mrs Blair that she was struggling to find work that fitted with looking after her son, 14, and daughter, nine, Mrs Blair offered her a role working 16 and a half hours a week. University-educated Miss Allain said: ‘It had been difficult trying to find work. I had a good CV, but getting into work was hard. ‘We met at a function and she said “Do you want to work at my personal office? You could do hours to suit the children”. I felt very blessed. I thought, what an extraordinary person to do that – to take me from a situation where I was struggling to a new start.’ The job allowed her to drop the children at school and then finish work in time to see them at the end of the day. ‘It was a friendly atmosphere in the office,’ she said. ‘There were just five of us. Cherie was very nice. I did three days a week from 9.30am to 3pm, it suited me.’ For just over a year, she worked at the office in London where her role involved replying to correspondence and updating Mrs Blair’s website. But in January, after an office re-organisation, she was asked if she would change to a full-time job, working until 6pm five days a week. 'Dispassionate': Cherie Blair, Miss Allain says, went from being a perfect boss to being incredibly cold . Email correspondence seen by the Mail, shows how Miss Allain was sacked from her £12,500-a-year role by Mrs Blair by email on January 16, after she turned down working 9am to 6pm five days a week. After Miss Allain wrote an email stating how she did not think she could balance the extra hours, Mrs Blair replied: ‘I am really sorry Louise that it’s not been possible to make it work but we need the role to be full time.’ When Miss Allain asked if that meant she was being fired, Mrs Blair curtly responded: ‘You are being made redundant as there is no longer a part time role.’ Miss Allain suggested to the office manager that she work 9am to 6pm two days a week on a job share, but she says she was told, ‘that won’t work, it’s messy’. She then asked if she could do some of the hours from home, but was told this would not be possible. How can she go from being a forward thinking boss who you couldn’t ask for more from to being so dispassionate and cold? Miss Allain said that she now wished . she had never taken the job. ‘I am just washed up,’ she said. ‘Prospective employers see I worked for her for only a year before . leaving and think that is suspect. ‘If you explain what happened, they think, “Mrs Blair would not have done that”. ‘I’d have been better off never taking the job.’ She . added: ‘I genuinely feel hurt. My daughter has a couple more years at . primary school. I want to be around for parent evenings and to help with . homework. ‘The children . will grow up quickly and I felt indebted because I thought Mrs Blair . appreciated I wanted face to face time with them. 'Now . I’ve got next month’s bills coming up, loans to pay and I don’t have . another salary. I’ve had to sign on. I never wanted to see the inside of . a job centre again. ‘I thought she had pulled me away from that place, but now she has sent me back.’ Mrs . Blair, who returned to her work as a barrister after the birth of each . of her four children, has been a frequent proponent of flexible working. Last year, in an article calling for . employers not to ‘squander the talents of modern mothers’, Mrs Blair . wrote that bosses had to set a ‘personal example’ in adopting . ‘family-friendly policies’. She wrote: ‘We need to think about what we can do to support parents who want to prioritise full-time caring for a period when their children are young... ‘We all need to do more as individuals, as employers and as a community to make space for people to make these choices and rejoice in diversity in family life’ She said stay-at-home mothers should get government funded training and subsidised salaries to encourage them to return to work and boost the economy. She suggested they should be given ‘returnerships’ – apprentice-style programmes for parents after long breaks from the workforce spent caring for their children. And in an interview in November last year, Mrs Blair added: ‘Flexible working is really important but it’s really important that firms don’t look on this as “the mummy track”, i.e., for those who are not going to make it. They need to acknowledge that part-time workers can make a real contribution.’ Mrs Blair said the state could subsidise salary and training for the first six months that a parent, either a father or a mother, returned to work. She also argued that employers should be encouraged to create more part-time, family friendly jobs to tempt women back into employment. Last night a spokesman for Mrs Blair said: ‘Cherie’s office is very small, but she does try where possible to offer part-time jobs to women with young children, indeed there are two other part-timers with children who continue to work there.’","Louise Allain, 41, offered job in Mrs Blair's office just over a year ago .

"Case to answer: Theodora Sayn-Wittgenstein admitted racially abusing a first-aider and attacking security guards at an Oktoberfest party in St Andrews . A German princess tried to strip at a posh Oktoberfest party - before making racist comments, assaulting first aiders and lashing out at police when she was told to stop, a court heard today. Her Serene Highness Princess Theodora Sayn-Wittgenstein was in the dock at Dundee Sheriff Court after admitting telling first aider Farah Jasmin Hussain: 'I was doing my nails this morning - I wondered how many Muslims I could kill.' The court heard the 27-year-old princess, who turned up at court wearing a long brown wig to disguise herself from waiting photographers, had gone to St Andrews - where she received a degree in International Relations before working in Jordan. She attended the exclusive Oktoberfest party held at Kinkell Byre every March with friends and at the end of the night she tried to climb a fence before stripping off some of her outfit. She was taken to the first aid room - making the racist remarks before attacking a security guard and a first aider. Sayn-Wittgenstein - who works in her father's alternative energy business - then had to be restrained by numerous security guards - before police turned up and handcuffed her. Officers were even forced to put her in leg restraints to get her into a police car.  She then lashed out at police - later telling them she did so because she 'thought she was being kidnapped'. Fiscal depute Trina Sinclair told Dundee Sheriff Court: 'At 10.30pm security were attempting to usher the last stragglers to the shuttle buses. 'The accused was in the courtyard area. Damon Creevy, a security guard, saw her climbing railings and drawing attention to herself. The princess turned up at court wearing a long brown wig to disguise herself from waiting photographers . She added: 'She started to remove some of her clothing and Mr Creevy told her to climb down and put her clothing back on but she refused. 'She was eventually taken down and to the first aid room. A security guard assisted by Farah Hussain attempted to replace her clothing. 'She had began to calm down but became aggressive again and said: ""I was doing my nails this morning and I wondered how many Muslims I could kill"". 'Ms Hussain left the room in tears because of the accused. The accused stood on a chair and began to rant about her human rights. 'Cara Anderson stood behind her trying to stabilise the chair she was standing on but she fell on top of Miss Anderson.' Prestigious: The princess received a degree in International Relations at St Andrews University - where the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were educated - before working in Jordan . She added: 'The accused began to thrash and struck her several times. She then kicked witness Creevy to the chest and attempted to headbutt Miss Anderson. 'When police arrived they found the accused on the floor in an arm lock and with her legs being held down by security. 'She was handcuffed but her demeanor didn't change. She kicked and lashed out and leg restraints were applied.' Sayn-Wittgenstein, who lives in Germany but who gave an address in the Chelsea area of London on court papers, pleaded guilty to two charges of assault, one of breach of the peace aggravated by religious prejudice and one under the Police and Fire Reform (Scotland) Act. The offences took place on March 8 this year. Defence solicitor Douglas Williams said Sayn-Wittgenstein had 'brought shame on herself and her family'. He said: 'Her behaviour was totally out of character - she has a degree in International Relations and has lived in Jordan, immersing herself in Middle Eastern culture. 'She accepts she made the comments described and that is of particular concern to her - she has no disposition against any group. 'Her behaviour was reprehensible but she has taken responsibility to come back to this country and face the music. 'The whole experience of being in custody for the weekend was extremely unnerving to her.' Sheriff Mark Stewart QC fined Sayn-Wittgenstein £1,000. He said: 'The overwhelming impression one gets is of disorderly and violent conduct occasioned by far too much drink for someone who was unble to properly deal with that level of intake. 'I deal with you in the same way as I would deal with anyone who behaves in this way. These comments you made are unacceptable - they would cause nothing but division, concern and unhappiness.' Sayn-Wittgenstein made no comment as she left court.  She left with her head covered in a coat and her father, Prince Ludwig, covering her with an umbrella. The family are German aristocracy  - but not official Royalty. Descendants of German royal families . still carry their titles, although they have no meaning and are legally . considered part of their names. From 1871, the Kings of Prussia also served as German Emperors, with Wilhelm II being the last. He abdicated in 1918, following World War I, and the German monarchy was dismantled. The charity Oktoberfest event is held annually by St Andrews students but attracts guests from around the world. At last year's event an international businessman, Emanuele Ferrero Ventimiglia, who lives in one of London's most expensive streets, bit off part of a security guard's ear. But he was acquitted of an assault charge after a jury decided he acted in self defence.","Theodora Sayn-Wittgenstein, 27, had gone to the party with friends and tried to climb a fence at the end of the night .

"Lost: Nora Al-Daher, 50, has been ordered to pay back £1 million in unpaid cheques that she used to buy gambling chips in London's Ritz casino . An ‘unimaginably rich’ Saudi heiress who lost £2million in one night of gambling at The Ritz was yesterday chastised by a judge, who ordered her to pay everything she owed. Nora Al-Daher, 47, tried to sue the Piccadilly casino for encouraging her to keep spending, claiming staff ‘took advantage of her gambling addiction’. But at the High Court yesterday, Judge Anthony Seys Llewellyn threw out the case, saying she was fully responsible for her actions. He said the loss was no catastrophe for the Arab politician’s wife, who once had £6million transferred into her account over a period of just ten days after claiming she ‘needed it to pay for the kids’. Two months after her losses in London, she and her family lost another £3million in Las Vegas. ‘Mrs Al-Daher is a person of wealth unimaginable to the ordinary person and, I suspect, to many of moderate or substantial wealth,’ the judge said. ‘The enormous sums she gambled and the enormous losses she sustained were within her means.’ Mrs Al-Daher – who is the daughter of a wealthy Saudi and is married to Omani foreign minister Sayyid Badr bin Hamad bin Hamood Al-Busaidi – had built up a reputation for spending huge amounts in casinos before arriving at The Ritz on April 3, 2012. Within hours, she reached her £1.7million cheque limit playing card game punto banco – a type of baccarat. At her request, the limit was then extended to £2million, which she lost while also giving out £14,000 in tips to the dealer and other staff. But some of the cheques she issued were not honoured, and The Ritz took her to court to claim £1million in unpaid debts. Mrs Al-Daher, known as ‘Princess Nora’, subsequently launched a counter-claim, arguing that staff wrongly allowed her to gamble on credit. She claimed she should be given back the £1million that she had already paid to The Ritz. She argued that she had been a ‘vulnerable’ gambling addict since 1999, and said casino staff ‘positively encouraged’ her to keep playing when she was in no fit state to continue. ‘I refused to deal with the thought that I was a gambler and, for that matter, a high roller,’ she told the court. ‘I always felt that I was in control and could stop whenever I wanted to ... I needed someone that night to tell me to stop playing and bring me to my senses.’ Yesterday, Judge Seys Llewellyn exonerated The Ritz, saying Mrs Al-Daher had given no sign that her gambling was out of control. Scroll down for video . Ritz Casino: The High Court deputy judge ruled the casino (pictured) in Piccadilly, London, did not have a duty of care to Mrs Al-Daher, who claimed staff should have refused to sell her the £2 million chips that she then lost . Wealthy family: Mrs Al-Daher is the wife of Oman's foreign minister Sayyid Badr bin Hamad. The court heard they have a fortune from her father in Saudi Arabia and from her husband's business interests in Oman . The court also heard there was no medical or psychiatric evidence that she was a gambling addict. During her frequent trips to London, Mrs Al-Daher has been a regular in the capital’s casinos, often spending outrageously. The judge said: ‘She exhibited no signs of distress, irritation, anger or loss of control that evening. ‘It is striking that she and her family gambled away five million US dollars in Las Vegas in June, some two to three months later. ‘The scale of her wealth ... is an inescapable feature of this case, as is the fact that, for those with the means to do so, it may be acceptable, or even enjoyable, to ride the roller coaster of losses.’ He rejected claims that Mrs Al-Daher had been given credit in breach of gaming rules. Mrs Al-Daher, who lives in Muscat, Oman, was ordered to pay the £1million she owed, plus interest.","Noora Abdullah Mahawish Al-Daher, 50, lost £2m using cheque-bought chips .

"The sinister ghosts of Christmas past went on display in Germany on Sunday to remind visitors at an exhibition of how the greatest event in Christianity became warped by history’s fanatics. The exhibition in Ulm called ‘Decorated’ is about Christmas tree ornaments through the ages - many of them devoted to the egos of demagogues like Kaiser Wilhelm, architect of WW1, Hitler and Stalin. Visitors can see the porcelain heads of Hitler that replaced the angel or star at the top of the tree during the Third Reich. Christmas decorations which were hijacked by dictators have gone on display in a museum in Ulm, Germany . Other must-have accessories during Hitler’s regime included silver balls bearing the party salute ‘Sieg Heil!’ or Heil to Victory! and little decorations bearing swastikas. For citizens of Soviet Russia, who went against the official ideology of the atheist state, there were red stars to place on trees instead. Kaiser Wilhelm gloried in photos of himself beneath Reich eagles with their wings spread out and model Zeppelin airships with the Iron Cross motif painted on their sides. It was also fashionable between the years 1914 and 1918 to have a bauble made into the shape of ‘Big Bertha,’ the monstrous 150 ton howitzers used by the German army during WW1 to pound fortresses and trench lines into oblivion. The 'sieg heil' and swastika baubles show how even the Christian tradition of Christmas was used to promote evil ideologies such as fascism . This decoration gives a dark glimpse into how the Third Reich would have celebrated the festive season . Ulm’s Brotkultur Museum is staging the fascinating exhibition which also reaches back further than the great dictators of the past century. Over 400 tree ornaments are on show . altogether, the collection of a private Ulm family which has loaned them . for the display running until February next year. The tradition to decorate a Christmas tree goes back to the middle ages. At that time it was customary to decorate houses and churches from advent until Candlemas with green branches representing the ‘tree of paradise’ from which Eve picked her apple in the Old Testament. In the 16th century the first Christmas trees were decorated with apples, nuts, biscuits and paper flowers  and made their entrance into middle-class homes. They were also a Protestant counterweight to the Catholic cribs displayed in all churches. In this picture taken in 1937 the Fuhrer receives a present from two Santas while attending a Christmas party given by the Chief of the Chancellery in Berlin . The first angel, star and Christmas figurines were made from pressed cotton, papier-mâché, or wax in the 17th century. Germany became the main centre of manufacturer of glass ornaments so beloved of Queen Victoria in the 18th and 19th centuries. The most recent exhibits in the collection come from China where most of the world’s cheap Christmas tree baubles are now produced.","German museum putting on exhibition called 'Decoration'

"An auction house has provoked fury in the Jewish community after it sold Nazi memorabilia on the holiest day in the Jewish calendar. J.P. Humbert Auctioneers sold flags emblazoned with swastikas and Hitler Youth armbands on September 25, as Jews observed Yom Kippur. The Northamptonshire auction house has since admitted the timing of the sale was 'unfortunate' and tried to donate an undisclosed amount to a Holocaust charity, which refused the offer. Auctioneer Jonathan Humbert (seen right), admitted the timing of the sale had been 'unfortunate' The Holocaust Educational Trust refused the donation on the grounds they don’t take money from the sale of items associated with the Nazi regime. A spokesperson for the charity said: 'The Holocaust Educational Trust will not accept any donations from organisations which profit from the sale of items associated with the Nazi regime. 'It is our view that these items are best placed in archives, museums or in an educational context.' Mr Humbert defended the auction house, based in Towcester, Northants, and said yesterday: 'Not being Jewish, how am I expected to know the dates of Jewish festivals?

"Janan Harb says she was secretly married to the late King Fahd - then a prince and minister of the interior of Saudi Arabia - in 1968 . A British woman who claims she was married to the late King of Saudi Arabia has won an early round of a multi-million pound legal battle with his son, as she threatens to expose details of her late husband's harem. Janan Harb says she was secretly married to the  late King Fahd - then a prince and minister of the interior of Saudi Arabia - in 1968 when she was 19, and he had promised to provide for her . financially for the rest of her life. But she said she was forced to leave the country several years later, because his family disapproved of their union. Mrs Harb says she is owed a lump sum of £12 million - promised to her 11 years ago -plus the ownership of two high-value apartments in central London. She has warned Prince Abdul Aziz - son of the late King Fahd - that she will 'expose' what it is really like to be married to a Saudi king if he does not pay up. Prince Abdul has argued the High Court in England had no jurisdiction to try Ms Harb’s claim because he had 'state immunity'. But a High Court judge today ruled against him after a hearing in London. Mrs Justice Rose said the prince could not rely on a defence of state immunity to defeat Mrs Harb’s claim. After the ruling, Mrs Harb, who is in her 60s, told reporters that she was 'very happy and relieved'. 'After 12 years of persistence I am very happy and relieved,' Mrs Harb told reporters after today’s ruling. 'If . the prince is going to appeal, I am going to accept the offer of the . movie of the book I have written - I am going to spill the beans.' Mrs Harb says Prince Abdul Aziz had told her that he was prepared to honour the terms of his father’s promise - and had offered to pay a lump sum of £12 million and to transfer to her the title of two central London properties. She says she has not received the money or the properties - and has taken legal action. Mrs Harb  (pictured in the late 1960s, left and in 2006, right) she said she was forced to leave the country several years after her 1968 marriage, because his family disapproved of their union . Prince Fahd with 'secret' wife Janan Harb at her Al Sharafya Palace before her banishment in 1970 . The judge said Prince Abdul Aziz had not made any response 'as regards the accuracy or otherwise' of Mrs Harb’s allegations. His submissions had been 'limited to contesting the jurisdiction of the court'. Mrs Justice Rose said she had seen a letter from the Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia in London saying the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia supported the prince’s claim for state immunity. Mrs Justice Rose had analysed legal argument at a High Court hearing in London in May and handed down her ruling at a hearing in London today. The prince was not at today’s hearing. Mrs Harb says Prince Abdul Aziz had told her that he was prepared to honour the terms of his father's (pictured) promise . Mrs Harb says she is owed a lump sum of £12 million - promised to her 11 years ago - plus the ownership of two high-value apartments in central London . Mrs Justice Rose said Mrs Harb alleged that the prince had made his offer at a meeting in 2003, two years before King Fahd died. The judge said it had been assumed that the prince would have been acting as King Fahd’s representative. She said if Mrs Harb had brought the claim when King Fahd was alive - and serving as king - both he and the prince would have been able to claim 'sovereign immunity'. The judge said it had been assumed that the prince would have been acting as King Fahd's representative . Mrs Justice Rose said she had been asked to decide whether, when King Fahd died, and ceased to be head of state of Saudi Arabia, immunity continued to extend to everything he did when head of state. The judge said there was no evidence of a similar claim being brought before. A spokesman for law firm Neumans, which represented Mrs Harb, said later: 'Mrs Harb is passionate about sharing her personal account of what it is truly like to be married to a Saudi King and believes the exposure will be of public interest. 'Her story has received international interest from film producers and she is currently in detailed discussions to progress the adaptation of her book into a film. There are also negotiations under way with regard to the publishing of her book in advance of this.' Mrs Harb’s solicitor, Mandeep Kaur Virdee, added: 'We are delighted with the outcome of this judgment. The law surrounding this area has already established, confirming that personal immunity ceases when a head of state is no longer in office for any reason. 'The prince’s application sought to extend the personal immunity privilege by suggesting that if a sovereign dies whilst still an acting monarch, the deceased and their agents could continue to enjoy the privilege of personal immunity . 'This judgment confirms that once a sovereign is out of office for whatever reason, including death, personal immunity does not survive.' Mrs Harb says she was wife number two in the King's harem. Fahd already had one official wife, Anoud, who went on to bear him 11 children. Although the two women knew about one another, Fahd decreed that they would never meet. Mrs Harb says she was kept as a virtual prisoner, albeit in luxury. Her father, who had separated from her mother, lived in a villa inside the palace walls, as did her sister and brother-in-law. There was also a villa for one of her close friends and her husband but beyond these six people and the staff, which included two personal maids, a butler, two drivers, two gardeners, two handymen and two chefs, she rarely saw anyone else. Then, in 1970, after two years of marriage, Mrs Harb was suddenly ordered to leave the kingdom by Fahd's brother. She was given two hours to go and her belongings were forwarded to the Saudi embassy in Beirut. She was 23.","Janan Harb says she was secretly married to the  late King Fahd in 1968 .

"We are constantly told how much sugar there is in fizzy drinks and cakes. But what about the hidden sugar in so-called healthy foods? A leading professor has spoken out about the dangers of 'hidden sugar' in food. He also cautions against opting for low fat foods that are often full of sugar instead to give them flavour. Graham MacGregor, Professor of Cardiovascular Medicine at the Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine at Barts and The London Hospital, says the food industry is adding more and more sugar to food, which consumers are largely unaware of, as it is mostly hidden. Hidden enemy: A leading professor has warned that many of us have no idea how much sugar is hidden in certain foods. He has compared well-known sugary foods such as Coke, Frosties and popcorn with other that many of us consider to be quite healthy . Writing for The Conversation, he said: 'Added sugar in our diet is a very recent phenomenon and only occurred when sugar, obtained from sugar cane, beet and corn, became very cheap to produce. 'It’s a completely unnecessary part of our calorie intake: it has no nutritional value, gives no feeling of fullness and is acknowledged to be a major factor in causing obesity and diabetes both in the UK and worldwide.' Professor MacGregor has compiled a table of some of the most common culprits. He says: 'While it may not be surprising that a can of Coca Cola has a staggering nine teaspoons of sugar (35g), similar amounts can be found in the most unlikely of foods.' These include flavoured water, yogurts, canned soup, ready meals and even bread. The full list of items Professor MacGregor analaysed (Source: The Conversation) Hidden where you least expect it: 300g (about 3/4 can) of Heinz Tomato Soup contains four teaspoons of sugar, while 150g of Yeo Valley 0% Fat Vanilla yogurt contains five . Half a jar of this Ragu Tomato and Basil pasta sauce has nearly as much sugar as a bowl of Frosties . As Professor MacGregor expains: 'You might opt for 0 per cent fat in your yoghurt, but what if it also comes with five teaspoons of sugar? A bowl of Frosties with semi-skimmed milk only has four.' At the other end of his scale, a Starbucks caramel Frappuccino with whipped cream - made with skimmed milk - contains 11 teaspoons of sugar. A can of regular Coke has nine, a Mars bar eight. When it comes to food, a Sharwood's Sweet and Sour Chicken with Rice contains six teaspoons - two more than a 25g bag of Butterkist toffee popcorn. 'It’s clear this sugar plays a part in soaring levels of obesity and diabetes. To this end, leading health experts from across the globe have united to tackle – and to unmask hidden sugar so consumers can make informed decisions about what they eat and drink.' Sharwoods' Sweet and Sour Chicken with Rice contains six teaspoons - more than a small bag of toffee popcorm . He adds that sugar in our diets should now be gradually reduced, just as salt has been over the past few years. 'Salt . content in food products in the supermarkets have now been reduced by . 20-40 per cent and as a result, salt intake has fallen in the UK by 15 . per cent (between 2001-2011), the lowest known figure of any developed . country.' This this will . have reduced stroke and heart attack deaths by a minimum of 9,000 per . year, with a saving in health care costs of at least £1.5bn a year, . according to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence . (NICE). Crammed: A regular can of Coke contains nine teaspoons of sugar, while one Mars bar contains eight . Professor MacGregor says that a similar move could be taken with sugar. 'Like salt, most of the sugar we consume is hidden in processed food and soft drinks. 'There are also specific taste receptors for sugar, which if sugar intake is gradually reduced, become more sensitive. So over time we don’t notice that sugar levels have gone down. 'If we can persuade the Department of Health that this programme is very likely to help considerably with the obesity epidemic -  and in particular to reduce childhood obesity - while also reducing the incidence of dental disease, and (very likely) the number of people developing Type 2 diabetes, it should have a good chance of success.

"Police crime figures cannot be trusted, official watchdogs ruled last night. Amid widespread evidence of fiddling by police forces, the UK Statistics Authority withdrew its stamp of approval from the data. It is a massive blow for ministers who have repeatedly trumpeted that crime has fallen by 10 per cent since the Coalition came to power. MPs said the decision could further harm trust in the police, which has already been hit by scandals such as Plebgate. The UK Statistics Authority has withdrawn its stamp of approval on police crime figures . The statistics authority says the crime figures no longer comply with its code of practice – indicating the data cannot be trusted. ‘There is accumulating evidence that suggests the underlying data on crimes recorded by the police may not be reliable,’ said Sir Andrew Dilnot, the watchdog’s chairman. He pointed to a warning from the Office for National Statistics that police records appear to ‘overstate the true rate at which crime has been falling’ by failing to take into account hundreds of thousands of offences. Sir Andrew also highlighted evidence, submitted to Westminster’s public administration committee, that massaging figures to hit targets was ‘ingrained in policing culture’. Officers told MPs that high-profile and politically sensitive crimes are often reclassified. An offence of robbery may be transformed into ‘other theft’ and a burglary may become criminal damage to downplay its significance. Some offences are recorded as ‘no crime’ because there is no direct evidence. Where a mobile phone owner is unable to prove it was stolen it might be deemed lost. The Office for National Statistics (graph showing crime levels since 1981, pictured) has already said police records 'appear to overstate the rate at which crime has been falling' In testimony to the public administration . committee, Constable James Patrick, who analyses crime figures for the . Met, said even rapes, child sex abuse, robberies and burglary were . disappearing in a ‘puff of smoke’. Forces were accused of downgrading crimes . to less serious offences and even erasing them altogether by labelling . them as accidents or errors. MPs were told of a string of controversial techniques used by officers to cut recorded crime, including ‘cuffing, nodding, skewing and stitching’. Last night Bernard Jenkin, who chairs the Westminster committee, said the inquiry had exposed complacency about crime data at all levels. Tory MP and chair of the Westminster committee Bernard Jenkin (pictured) said the ruling should be a wake-up call for all chief constables . He said the downgrading of the crime figures, which are at record lows, should be a wake-up call to chief constables all around the country. Jack Dromey, Labour’s spokesman on policing, said the damning verdict on the police figures was unprecedented. ‘It exposes [Home Secretary] Theresa May’s claim on crime reductions as baseless and out of touch,’ he added. ‘When challenged on hollowing out the police service, with 10,000 frontline police officers axed, Theresa May and ministers have repeatedly hidden behind the 10 per cent fall in police recorded crime.’ Keith Vaz, the Labour MP who chairs the Commons home affairs select committee, said: ‘This is an extraordinary step which fuels the concern around the reliability of crime statistics. ‘The recent allegations of manipulation of crime figures go right to the heart of the public trust in the police and how crime figures are compiled.’ Earlier this month, Met Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said there was truth to the allegation from Mr Patrick that statistics were being massaged. Tom Winsor, Chief Inspector of Constabulary for England and Wales, who is leading an inquiry into crime statistics, has said he expects to find ‘some fiddling’. Ex-Met commissioner Lord Stevens has said ‘fiddling of figures’ had been going on since he joined the police. He told the home affairs committee it was the ‘biggest scandal coming our way’. Last night, Norman Baker, Liberal Democrat crime prevention minister, said: ‘It is vital that recorded crime statistics are as robust as they can possibly be – and this Government has a strong record on reinforcing their independence and accountability. ‘One of the first things we did when we came into office was to transfer responsibility for crime statistics to the independent Office for National Statistics. ‘Recorded crime has fallen by more than 10 per cent since June 2010 – and it is important to note that the separate and wholly independent crime survey for England and Wales has also fallen by more than 10 per cent over the same period. ‘It now stands at its lowest level since the survey began in 1981. So the evidence is clear: police reform is working and crime is falling.’ Responsibility for the production and publication of crime statistics for England and Wales was transferred from the Home Office to the ONS in April 2012. But the Home Office remains operationally responsible for the collection and validation of crime figures from police forces in England and Wales, before they are passed on to the ONS for publication. Police forces are responsible for generating recorded crime data, and each force has a crime registrar responsible for overseeing compliance with standards for recording crimes. The next crime statistics are due to be published next week. Glen Watson, who is the director general of the ONS, said: ‘We have already highlighted our concerns about the quality of crime recording by the police, and the variations in trends between recorded crime and our own crime survey for England and Wales. ‘I am pleased this has been recognised by the authority.’ The separate British Crime Survey – a survey of around 30,000 households – continues to have trusted status, officials said.","UK Statistics Authority withdrew approval on UK crime figures .

"They might be known for working together in complex colonies, but woodland ants can be quite antisocial. The insects are able to fire smelly acid into the air to ward off predators and now, their offensive behaviour has been caught on camera. Woodland ants work together to jointly squirt foul-smelling liquid when they sense a threat overhead – such as a hungry bird. Anti-social behaviour: Woodland ants (pictured) are able to fire acid into the air to ward off predators. The insects work together to jointly squirt foul-smelling liquid when they sense at threat over head - such as a hungry bird . Little squirts: In order to trigger the insect's reaction, the photographer gave the ant's nest a tap, which prompted the insects to squirt the acid in the air from their tiny abdomens (pictured) Formica . rufa - also known as woodland ants and horse ants - are native to . Europe, Britain and North America in woodland and parkland. Worker ants are red and brownish black and measure between 4.5mm and 9mm in length. They can spray formic acid from their abdomens in defence, like many other species of ants. Nests . are often built against rotting wood in the sun and colonies can have . between 100,000 and 400,000 workers plus 100 queens. At their largest . they can measure several metres in height and diameter. The creatures are aggressively territorial and attack and remove rival ant species in their patch. Nuptial . flights - an important phase in the reproduction of most ant, termite . and some bee species - take place in the springtime and are often marked . by fierce battles between neighbouring colonies. Wood ants typically have multiple nests so they can move around in case of drastic changes in the environment. The formic acid is not harmful to humans and has the same odour as vinegar. However, it is enough to scare off larger predators such as woodpeckers and jay birds, who could wreak havoc on an ant nest. Woodland ants live in the UK as well as other parts of Europe. Their . aggressive behaviour was captured by Paul Quagliana, 43, a wildlife . photographer, who found a colony of the ants on a log in Wareham Forest, . Dorset. In order to . trigger the insect’s reaction, he gave their nest a tap, which prompted . the ants to squirt acid in the air from their tiny abdomens. ‘There are many different species of . woodland ants in Britain and these are called Formica rufa,’ said Mr . Quagliana, who lives in Gillingham, Dorset. ‘As a defence mechanism they squirt formic acid which smells a bit like salt and vinegar crisps or fish and chips,’ he explained. ‘If you put your hand an inch or two away from the nest they will squirt the acid to try and drive anything away. The ants' aggressive behaviour was captured . by Paul Quagliana, 43, a wildlife photographer, who found a colony of . the ants on a log in Wareham Forest, Dorset. He carefully provoked them to see how they worked together to squirt streams of smelly acid upwards (pictured left and right) Woodland ants (pictured) are the largest native ant species of the UK and are known to be aggressively territorial. They often attack and remove other ant species from the area . ‘It doesn't hurt but it stinks and I imagine if it was to get in your eyes it would probably sting.’ In . order to capture the action, he set up his camera on a tripod, ensuring . the sun was behind the ants, which had built a nest on a log. ‘I then tapped the log and lifted my hand up and started taking photographs,’ he said. ‘I didn't see it when they were squirting the acid but when I looked back at the images, the sun had captured the droplets.’ Formic acid is used as a preservative and antibacterial agent on animal food, tanning leather, dying textiles, and in the making of rubber.

"With trust in Britain's politicians at its lowest ebb in decades, perhaps those in the corridors of power could take a leaf out of the man dubbed 'the poorest president in the world'. There is no chance of Uruguayan leader Jose Mujica being caught fiddling his expenses or paying a clever account to avoid taxes - he barely claims a salary. The charismatic 77-year-old has refused to adapt his lifestyle to embrace the trappings of power that come with being the country's figurehead. Charismatic Uruguayan president Jose Mujica has refused to adapt his . lifestyle to match the trappings of wealth that come with being the . country's most powerful figure and he still lives on his farm . Turning down the invitation to live at a luxurious grace and favour residence owned by the state, he instead continues to reside at his ramshackle farm situated a few miles away from the country's capital city of Montevideo. The only sign the country's leader is at home are the pair of police officers who stand guard at the end of his heavily tractor-rutted dirt track. Mr Mujica gives 90 per cent of his monthly salary, the equivalent of £7,500, away to charity leaving him with just £485 a month to live off. The part-time farmer's proudest and most valuable possessions are his tired-looking Volkswagen Beetle and his three-legged dog Manuela. Water comes from a well which is surrounded by overgrown weeds and the laundry goes not in a tumble dryer but on the washing line outside. Mr Mujica on his farm with his three-legged dog Manuela . The president's austere lifestyle is a world away from that of many politicians in the UK who have been caught out trying to unethically and in some cases illegally boost their incomes by fiddling their expenses. It may be three years since the expenses scandal broke, but the fallout continues. Just this week former Labour MP Margaret Moran was found to have fiddled her parliamentary expenses and received more than £53,000 to which she was not entitled. She evaded a jail sentence because . and has not received a criminal record because she was . deemed unfit to stand trial because of depression and so the jury could . not find her guilty of any crime. Her . false claims are so far the largest discovered in the expenses scandal, ahead . of the £30,000 which former Labour minister Elliot Morley was found . guilty of claiming and sent to jail for last year. But . Mr Mijuca, a former left-wing revolutionary, says he has no interest in . amassing a fortune. He says he has all he needs and that material . wealth does not buy happiness. Speaking . to the BBC he said: 'I'm called 'the poorest president', but I don't . feel poor. Poor people are those who only work to try to keep an . expensive lifestyle, and always want more and more,' he says. 'This . is a matter of freedom. If you don't have many possessions then you . don't need to work all your life like a slave to sustain them, and . therefore you have more time for yourself,' he says. 'I may appear to be an eccentric old man... But this is a free choice.' In contrast to many western politicians who aim to amass property empires, Mr Mujica last year declared his total assets at just £135,000. Elected in 2009, he spent the 1960s and 1970s as part of the Uruguayan guerrilla Tupamaros, a leftist armed group inspired by the Cuban revolution. Different outlook: 'I'm called 'the poorest president', he says, 'but I don't feel poor. Poor people are those who only work to try to keep an expensive lifestyle, and always want more and more' Mr Mujica gives 90 per cent of his monthly salary, the equivalent of £7,500 away to charity, leaving him with just £485 a month to live off . Just this week former Labour MP Margaret Moran (left) was found to have fiddled her parliamentary expenses and received more than £53,000 to which she was not entitled . He was shot six times and spent 14 years in jail, most of which was spent in tough conditions and isolation. He was only freed in 1985 when Uruguay returned to democracy. The altruistic leader used the Rio+20 conference in June this year to promote his anti-capitalist message to the world. He said: 'We've been talking all afternoon about sustainable development. To get the masses out of poverty. 'But what are we thinking? Do we want the model of development and consumption of the rich countries? I ask you now: what would happen to this planet if Indians would have the same proportion of cars per household than Germans? How much oxygen would we have left? 'Does this planet have enough resources so seven or eight billion can have the same level of consumption and waste that today is seen in rich societies? It is this level of hyper-consumption that is harming our planet.' Although he came to power with a . landslide victory, his popularity has waned slightly of late after two . controversial moves. In the limelight: Mr Mujica in his role as leader of the ruling Frente Amplio party, gestures to supporters during his closing campaign act in 2009 . Firstly, unlike the previous president he refused to veto a parliamentary bill which legalised abortions for pregnancies up to 12 weeks. Secondly he has agreed to a debate about legalising cannabis which has riled some sections of society. Yet the president will not be too worried as Uruguayan law means he is unable to stand for re-election in 2014, leaving him able to comfortably slip back into his simple life on the farm.","Uruguayan president Jose Mujica lives on a farm on the outskirts of Montevideo with his wife and three-legged dog .

"A father-of-four died of a massive caffeine overdose after eating a pack of instant-energy mints, an inquest heard. John Jackson, 40, was found dead after he snacked on the Hero mints bought from shops close to his home – seemingly unaware he had been consuming dangerous quantities of the stimulant. Coroner Robin Balmain recorded a verdict of accidental death, but said he would write to the Department of Health to warn of the potential danger of the mints after learning that each one contained 80mg of caffeine – around the same as a 250ml energy drink such as Red Bull. John Jackson, 40, died of a massive caffeine overdose after eating mints bought at his local sweet shop . Mr Jackson's estranged wife, Michelle Jackson, pictured with her daughters Rebecca Court, 23, and Amanda, 27, has been left devastated after his death . Each tin contains 12 mints with the packets retailing for between £1.95 and £4 online, although Mr Jackson’s family say they were on sale for as little as 50p at the shops close to his home. The former painter and decorator was found dead in his flat in Darlaston, West Midlands, in May by his estranged partner Michelle, 48. Black Country coroner Mr Balmain said: ‘This is a potentially very dangerous situation. The level of caffeine is enormous. I think I’m as certain as I can be that Mr Jackson didn’t know he was going to expose himself to this sort of danger.’ Pathologist Dr Dragana Cvijan told the hearing it was the first time she had come across a caffeine overdose. She said that while the cause of death was caffeine toxicity, an underlying liver condition which left heavy drinker Mr Jackson unable to properly absorb the stimulant was a contributing factor. A packet of Hero Instant Energy Mints, like those consumed by John Jackson shortly before he died of a massive caffeine overdose. Each mint said to contain more caffeine that a can of Red Bull . Hero Energy Ltd, the company who produce the sweets, said they were 'very saddened by the news' vowing to look again at how they can further inform customers of the risks of caffeine . Speaking after the inquest his stepdaughter Rebecca Court, 23, called for the mints to be banned.She said: ‘On the box they said one tablet equals one can of energy drinks. A kid could go in and buy them and the same thing could happen to him. ‘Dad loved eating mints. He ate all sorts of different brands and probably didn’t realise these mints had high amounts of caffeine in them. Something should be done about them. They are very, very dangerous.’  Manufacturer Hero Energy Ltd said it felt the company took adequate steps to make customers aware of the risk posed by caffeine. In a statement issued from its Birkenhead HQ, bosses Paul Hayes and Steve Hones said: ‘We are greatly shocked by this news and are deeply concerned. ‘Here at Hero, we fully understand the associated risk and dangers of caffeine and its consumption. ‘We are extremely vocal about these risks and highlight them at every available opportunity.’ Rebecca, left, was with her mother when they found Mr Jackson. She said: 'On the box they said one tablet equals one can of energy drinks. A kid could go in and buy them and the same thing could happen to him' They said each tin contained warnings about the product’s high caffeine content which said: ‘DO NOT exceed 5 Hero Mints in a 24-hour period’. The warning also advised against consumption by pregnant women, under-16s and ‘caffeine sensitive individuals’. Earlier this year, Dr Jack James, editor in chief of the Journal of Caffeine Research, warned caffeine was being consumed in such high quantities it was causing ‘untimely deaths’ and should be regulated. He said while some European countries have begun to take action, including sales restrictions and product labelling, most countries including the UK and the US have a ‘regulatory vacuum’.","Each mint contains the same levels of caffeine as a can of Red Bull .

"Supporters have raised $20,000 for an Atlanta security guard who became an internet sensation this week after he posted videos online showing his refusal to give in to abuse from troublemakers. Darien Long made headlines earlier this week after a video showing him tasering a violent woman outside Atlanta's Metro Mall spread online – it has now been viewed more than one million times. And since then more and more videos are emerging of the zero-tolerance guard refusing to give in to violent threats. In the footage, filmed by a camera on Long’s uniform, men are heard warning they’ll follow him home; he is racially abused; spat at; threatened with violence and objects are thrown at him all because he’s asked people to leave the shopping center or to stop hovering outside. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Zero tolerance: Darien Long has been lauded as a hero after a shocking video showed him tasering a woman outside a mall in Atlanta. An online fundraising campaign is currently at $20,000 supporting the guard . Cornered: A new video shows a mother was tasered after she and her children attacked a security guard in an Atlanta shopping mall . Warning: Long repeatedly tells the woman to 'back it up' before tasering her when she lashes out at him. The footage won the Atlanta Metro Mall guard plaudits online and there is now a fundraising campaign in his honor . Despite being in a position most would find terrifying, Long says he is . determined to enforce the rules and believes doing so ultimately helps . his community. He told Atlanta news station WSB-TV: ‘I feel like the taser and the . camera are the two most effective tools that I have. Do what you're . supposed to do or you get what's coming to you.' ‘What you do is clean up the neighborhood so other businesses can come in and downtown Atlanta can prosper,’ he added . There has been particular support for Long from . residents of the city who say they are fed up with people . believing they are above the law. ‘This is basically what we deal with every day,’ Resident Daniel Van . Briesen told the local broadcaster. ‘For it to happen in the shadow of the . capital building and the courthouse is a bit ridiculous.’ The five minute video which launched the vigilante guard into the public . eye on Tuesday is from an incident in May. It opens with the . guard warning children outside who are making noise. However, two mothers soon step in and start pushing Long with one . warning the guard:  'Don’t yell at my motherf***ing kids! You’ll get . beat!' Abused: Several videos showing the threats and slurs leveled against Darien Long can be seen online . Ready to attack: Another video shows a woman who is about to throw a poster board at the security guard before a friend holds her back . The confrontation gets increasingly tense as the woman refuses to move . back from the mall, starts shouting racial slurs and encourages the . young children to join in the abuse. Long is repeatedly heard telling the woman to ‘back it up’ and move away . before she walks to the mall doorway and lashes . out. Long then tasers her. The shocking video has won the officer legions of fans on Youtube and news site Reddit. Reddit launched the online appeal to raise money for Long after seeing the response to his story. Supportive comments on Reddit include: ‘Whatever they pay this guy, it's . not enough’, ‘Guy looks like a family man, looks like he is risking a . lot’ and ‘remind anyone of a sheriff in a wild west movie. One Youtube viewer simply writes: ‘Why do those naggers keep nagging him? Reddit editor Ryu Kenya said they started the campaign because Long is a ‘nice guy’. ‘He is a nice guy and that area is very dangerous,' he wrote on the website. 'There is a cop . station around the block but people still sell drugs around there. He . has to wear kevlar and has his own mugshot book. He was not too proud . about tasing the woman and wished it could have been avoided.’ Resilient: Darien Long says he wants to help clean up downtown Atlanta via his work as security guard for the Atlanta Metro Mall . Fundraising page: The Reddit campaign had raised almost $20,000 for Darien Long on Saturday morning and was still going up . The woman who attacked Long was reportedly charged with disorderly . conduct, criminal trespassing, contributing to the delinquency of a . minor, and simple battery. Since the campaign began it has raised $20, 000 so Long can buy himself more equipment. And it appears he needs it. Further videos posted online by Long show several abusive exchanges. In one he asks a group to leave but they consistently refuse, loitering . by the doorway and threatening to follow him home and ‘beat’ him. It ends with one of the group – another woman – throwing a sandwich board at him. Other videos show him confronting men he suspects of drug dealing and shoplifting. In another a man repeatedly pushes Long in the chest and calls for him to fight him in the street. 'Stay out the mall and we won’t have an issue', Long tells one of his abusers in a video . The guard seems bemused by the attention his work has attracted and said he doesn't want fame. What he wants is to see his area improve. ‘I don’t care about the fame or none of that crap. What I want is on . street gambling to go away, The people who just hang down here to make . money and be disruptive and for the drug dealing to leave . this area,’ he says on a response posted on YouTube. 'You can’t ever get rid of all the crime in any city but it shouldn’t be in . such proximity to the seat of power of the state of Georgia and the city . of Atlanta. People should be able to come downtown and do what they . want to do.' 'I’m really nobody to be honest with you.'","Online campaign has so far raised $20,000 for Darien Long a security guard at Atlanta's Metro Mall .

"Courting rituals between lovestruck youngsters differ greatly from country to country. In some places around the world, sex before marriage is considered a great taboo and the prospect of a teenage girl spending the night with her boyfriend remains highly unlikely. But in one village in Cambodia, fathers go out of their way to encourage their daughters to have sex: by building them love huts. Love shack? Attitudes towards sex in some villages in Cambodia remains extremely liberal . Members of the Kreung tribe in the northeast of the country believe that women can be empowered through spending the night with different members of the other sex. And when a girl reaches her early teenage years, or possibly even before, the love hut becomes the place for her to meet and get to know boys before deciding on her one true love. The tribe believes the ancient practice is the best way for girls to find their future husbands. The Kreung people have, however, moved on from their previous tradition of using a cocktail of alcohol and a centipede as a contraceptive, and now use condoms. When a girl  reaches her early teenage years, or possibly even before, the love hut becomes the place for her to meet and get to know boys before deciding on her one true love . The love huts were filmed by a documentary crew in Cambodia . But in a country where HIV and AIDS remains prevalent, and where concerns are often raised about the exploitation of youngsters in sex trafficking cases, the idea of encouraging youngsters to have sex so openly remains surprising. Communities in rural Cambodia continue to live close-knit existences to this day . Nang Chan, a 17-year-old girl who now lives full time in the love hut in the back garden of her parent's house, believes they offer her, and other girls like her, a sense of empowerment, though. 'The huts provide us independence and are the best way through which we can explore our true lover,' she told Techpuffs.com. 'If I find some special boyfriend and we both love each other, then I'll get intimate with him and have sex in my hut. 'But if I stop loving him and find another boy that I see more attractive, then I'll stop having sex with my previous boyfriend.' Dr Sudeepta Varma, speaking to National Geographic said that from a western perspective, love huts might be regarded as taboo as parents are usually looked upon as 'protectors' of a woman's virginity, and not promoters of it. According to villagers, divorce and sexual violence in the community remains non-existent, and young women only engage in relationships with those they feel comfortable with. Despite the liberal attitudes towards sex between unmarried youngsters, however, couples must save the privilege of being seen in the day together until they are happily engaged to be married.",Members of the Kreung tribe believe that women can be empowered by spending the night with different members of the opposite sex .

"The head of the Transportation Safety Administration (TSA) said Friday that underwear bombers are still a concern. Speaking at the Aspen Security Forum, TSA chief John Pistole said al Qaeda has retooled its underwear bomb designed to take planes down over the United States. Airport security systems had to be modified after a double agent discovered exposed the second iteration of the device last year, Pistole said during a question and answer session moderated by ABC reporter Brian Ross. Uncovered: TSA honcho John Pistole spoke in detail about 'Underwear 2,' the next generation of underwear bombs from al-Qaeda designed to being down planes over the U.S. TSA equipment ‘wasn’t calibrated to detect [the device], and all of our 800 bomb-sniffing dogs had not been trained for that specific type,’ Pistole said of the recently-discovered bomb. Designed to create an explosive cocktail by mixing two liquids with separate syringes Pistole called a ‘double initiation system,’ the security chief explained that ‘Underwear 2’ is a ‘new and improved’ device that has the potential to be much more effective than the first underwear bomb, which failed to detonate when Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab attempted to up a plane on Christmas Day, 2009. Instead of damaging the plane, the bomb instead severely burned the would-be terrorist’s groin, according to reports. Gotcha!: Said Al-Shehri, a Saudi second-in-command of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) was killed in a U.S. drone attack in Yemen, AQAP said on July 17, 2013 . The additional use of household caulk sealed the explosive device, keeping vapors from detection by bomb-sniffing dogs or TSA equipment, Pistole added. The TSA honcho attributed the more advanced bomb to Yemeni bomb making expert Ibrahim al-Asiri, an alleged member of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. After Ross referred to al-Asiri’s new bomb as ‘our greatest threat,’ Pistole agreed, saying ‘all the intel folks here [at the forum] know that is a clear and present danger.’ Yemeni authorities announced Thursday that Said al-Shehri, the deupty head of al-Qaeda in Yemen, was killed in a drone strike in the country, according to reports. In admitting his death, al-Qaeda claimed the fallen leader became lazy with his use of cell phones, making him an easy target.","The new bomb was discovered by a double agent .

"While some physicists may be working on string theory or quantum mechanics, Manuel Linares has decided to turn his attention to something else entirely – ice cream. The Spanish physicist and now professional cook has announced that he has invented a ‘magical’ ice cream that changes colour as you lick it. Dubbed ‘Xamaleón’, the ice creams tastes like a mix of fruits and was created during a cooking course attended by Mr Linares in Barcelona. Scroll down for video . While some physicists may be working on string theory or quantum mechanics, Manuel Linares has decided to turn his attention to something else entirely – ice cream. The Spanish physicist and now professional cook has just announced that he has been able to invent a ‘magical’ ice cream that changes colour as you lick it . Everyone laughed at his idea, but as a physicist he knew that there are various possibilities that might work, the 37-year-old told Cocinatis. Before it’s served, the treat is a light blue colour, but this quickly changes when the server adds a spray of ‘love elixir, as Mr Linares calls it. The spray transforms the ice cream into a dark pink shade in around 10 to 15 seconds. Before it’s served, the treat is a light blue colour (pictured), but this quickly changes when the server adds a spray of ‘love elixir, as Mr Linares calls it. The spray transforms the ice cream into a dark pink shade in around 10 to 15 seconds . When the customer licks the ice cream, it again changes into other pink shades as it melts . The formula, which remains a secret, is made entirely from natural ingredients, according to Mr Linares. The Spaniard said he gained his inspiration from the British ice cream genius Charlie Francis, the creator of a fluorescent ice. The chef is currently offering his ice cream at his shop in in the town of Calella de Mar, in the east Spanish province of Barcelona. He is also working on another two ice creams. One will react to ultraviolet lights in clubs, while another will turn from white to pink as it’s eaten. Mr Linares is now hoping to find buyers to sell the ice cream abroad. The science of ice cream just got serious. No longer content with simple taste tests, scientists now want to visualise exactly how the treat melts in the mouth. And one group of researchers in Spain has been able to do just that using software that reveals what makes the summer treat so addictive. Using a technique known as Temporal Dominance of Sensations (TDS), researchers have analysed how much 'coldness', 'creaminess' and 'roughness' is need to make the perfect frozen dessert. The software is able to generate coloured curves that follow changes in a variety of attributes, which also include 'gumminess' and how much the ice cream coats the taster's mouth. ‘As well as how it looks before being served, the texture on our tongue and palate is key to it being accepted and considered as a quality product,’ said researcher Susana Fiszman.

"Professor Carl Djerassi believes more parents will chose to start a family using IVF, even if they do not have fertility problems . Sex could soon exist purely for fun, as more women turn to IVF to have babies, the inventor of the contraceptive pill has claimed. Professor Carl Djerassi, 91, believes the Pill could become redundant as soon as 2050, as more men and women choose to start a family through the 'insurance policy' of IVF, even if they do not have fertility problems. It means would-be parents would freeze their eggs and sperms before being steralised, rendering the Pill pointless. The professor - who played a crucial role in developing the oral contraceptive in 1951 - says advances in fertility treatment will create a 'generation manana' in which people know they can control the timing of parenthood, without any repercussions. But it also means sex will become a futile exercise for those wanting to reproduce - and will instead become purely recreational. Speaking to the Sunday Telegraph, he said: 'The vast majority of women who will choose IVF in the future will be fertile women who have frozen their eggs and delayed pregnancy. 'I predict that many of these women will be fertilised by IVF methods because of the advances in genetic screening. And once that happens then IVF will start to become a normal non-coital method of having children.' He added: 'For them, the separation between sex and reproductions will be 100 per cent.' Professor Djerassi also predicted there will be more IVF fertilisations among fertile women in the next few decades - 'say by 2050' - than there currently is among those who are fertility-impaired. At the moment, that figure is around five million. But the professor cast doubt on the possibility of a male contraceptive pill, claiming it would take too long to test whether the product would have an impact on sperm quality. The professor, who has now retired from scientific work, has just penned his new autobiography, In Retrospect: From The Pill to the Pen. The 91-year-old predicts the Pill could become redundant as soon as 2050, as more people are steralised .","Professor Carl Djerassi, 91, believes the Pill could be redundant by 2050 .

Mexico centre back Hector Moreno (left), in action at last year's World Cup, is a target of Arsenal . Moreno, up against Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo, currently plays in La Liga with Espanyol . Moreno starred for Mexico in the World Cup last summer but Wenger will have to fend of interest from Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino, who worked with the 26-year-old during his time at Espanyol. The Mexican has been limited to only five first-team appearances for the La Liga outfit this season having recovered from a broken leg. Wenger looks set to be active in the January transfer window, especially after Mathieu Debuchy dislocated his shoulder at the weekend against Stoke. Debuchy will see a specialist in the next 48 hours to establish whether an operation is required, and if so he could miss three more months of the season.

"The woman, known as S, claims she was subjected to violence and pressure to marry and was told by her mother she would be beheaded if she went to the authorities for help as she did in 2005 (File picture) A couple threatened to kill their daughter if she rejected a forced marriage and behead her if she contacted authorities for help. A judge has since granted a temporary forced marriage protection order, banning the parents from leaving Britain, after the local authority in Croydon, London, said it 'did not trust them an inch' and feared younger children in the family would be spirited out of England if they were able to leave. The girl, known as S, claims she suffered repeated violence at the hands of her parents and grandmother as a teenager and was told she would be killed if she refused to marry abroad as this would 'bring dishonour on the family. She described a long history of being put under pressure to marry, and when she spoke to authorities in 2005 about suffering 'violence and intimidation' from her family she claimed her mother said her father would 'cut her head off' if she ever raised issues again. During a hearing at the Family Division of the High Court, Mr Justice Holman granted a temporary forced marriage protection order until next month. This prevents the family from leaving Britain after it emerged that the mother wanted to go to Afghanistan. Mr Justice Holman granted the order on the basis that Croydon County Council, which made the application, 'did not trust this family an inch' and feared three younger children in the family could be 'spirited out of Britain.' The High Court heard that S, who cannot be identified, had described suffering a long history of pressure to accept a forced marriage. The family, who are originally from Afghanistan, lived for a considerable time in Norway. During their time in Norway S, now 22, was referred to the local authority by her school health service because of concerns about her welfare. Mr Justice Holman made the order at a hearing at the High Court in London, part of the Royal Courts of Justice . Mr Justice Holman said a written decision from a public body or court in Norway, dated 2008, explained that the girl had been subjected to pressure to go to Afghanistan to marry. The plan had been that the family would go for a 14 day holiday but S would remain for six months to get married. A report of the 2008 proceedings said: 'The girl talks about violence against her from the family, mother, father, brother and grandmother. This has increased during the past month and has been happening on a daily basis. 'The girl said that her parents told her she would be killed if she would not travel, because this would bring dishonour to her family.' Mr Justice Holman granted a forced marriage protection order, until a further hearing in December . The court heard that this document also mentioned an incident after she had contact with the local authorities about death threats, intimidation and violence from her family in 2005. They were also claims the family was monitoring her. It added: 'The girl said after the emergency placement in 2005, the mother repeatedly told her that if S could contact the authorities again, her father will 'Take the girl and cut off her head.' The family had their passports seized in April this year by police because of fears ""criminal offences may have been, or were planned to be, committed upon"" the children. Mr Justice Holman added: 'The local authority very strongly resists that, for they do not, frankly, trust this family an inch. 'They consider that if any parent is allowed out of England and Wales, there is a real risk that, by some means or another, these children will be spirited out of England and Wales.' The court heard that S was planning to get married in Afghanistan, by her own choice, this October and had wanted her mother and youngest brother to travel to be at her wedding. Croydon County Council applied for a forced marriage protection order to prevent the family travelling abroad. This was granted on a temporary basis, until a full hearing on December 20. The penalty for breaking a forced marriage protection order is five years in prison, and parents who force their children to marry can be jailed for seven years.

"The Islamic State's black jihadist flag has been obliterated in a devastating airstrike by American forces on a Kobane hillside controlled by the militant group. In a series of images, what appears to be an ISIS militant can first be seen standing by the flag on Tilsehir hill near the Turkish border - after the terrorist group seized control of the strategically important hilltop 4km west of the town. Just moments later the hillside erupts into flames as the man flees for his life - and the fighter appears to stand his ground against the ferocious power of the weapon, although whether it is indeed a militant has not yet been confirmed. The images have emerged as American and Arab jets launched fresh attacks on ISIS positions in the north of Kobane - with pyrotechnic tracer ammunition lighting up the night sky and coalition warplanes destroying ISIS-held buildings with a barrage of air-to-surface missiles. Scroll down for video . The Islamic State's black jihadist flag has been obliterated in a devastating airstrike by American forces on a Kobane hillside controlled by the militant group.

Just moments later the hillside erupts into flames as what appears to be a member of the terrorist group looks on, clouds of dust rolling towards them . The 'figure' can be seen seemingly standing his ground as clouds of dust roll down the hillside. The pictures were captured at Yumurtalik village, in Sanliurfa province . The hillside is completely obliterated in the attack - said to be launched by U.S. forces. The images have emerged as American and Arab jets launched fresh attacks on ISIS positions in the north of Kobane . The pictures were captured at Yumurtalik village, in Sanliurfa province. Turkey, which has riled Kurdish leaders and frustrated Washington by refusing to allow fighters or weapons into Kobane, said this week it would help Iraqi Kurdish fighters cross into Syria to help their brethren against the militants . The terrorist group was thought to have been pushed out of the centre of the besieged Syrian city after hundreds of brave Kurdish resistance fighters coordinated fierce street battles with coalition bombing raids - forcing the well-equipped jihadis to retreat into the outskirts of Kobane. The pictures were captured at Yumurtalik village, in Sanliurfa province. Earlier the flag was still visible in Kobane - despite Kurdish territorial gains and weeks of sustained airstrikes by American and Arab warplanes. It could clearly still be seen inside city, raised over a multi-storey building just a few hundred feet away from where the yellow, triangular flag of the Kurdish People's Protection Unit (YPG) was seen fluttering above a largely destroyed housing complex. The chilling image of the ISIS flag still flying in Kobane emerged as lawmakers in Iraq's largely autonomous Kurdish region authorized peshmerga forces to cross into neighboring Syria to help fellow Kurds combat Islamic State militants in the city, providing much-needed boots on the ground. The unprecedented deployment will almost certainly depend on the support of Turkey, whose president criticized a U.S. airdrop of arms to Kurdish fighters after some of the weapons wound up in the hands of the extremists.

Smoke and dust is seen rising over the Syrian town of Kobane after U.S. warplanes carry out a bombing raid on Islamic State targets . Turkey, which has riled Kurdish leaders and frustrated Washington by refusing to allow fighters or weapons into Kobane, said this week it would help Iraqi Kurdish fighters cross into Syria to help their brethren against the militants, who also are being attacked by a U.S.-led campaign of airstrikes. But it is not clear how many fighters will be allowed in or whether they will be allowed to carry enough weapons to make an impact. The Kurds of Syria and Iraq have become a major focal point in the war against the Islamic State group, with Kurdish populations in both countries coming under significant threat by the militants' lightning advance. Lt. Gen. Frederick Hodges, the outgoing commander of NATO's Land Command in Izmir, Turkey, said the Turks have agreed to open up 'a land bridge of sorts' so that the peshmerga can get into Kobane to help with the fighting there. 'It seems to me that between the United States, Turkey and other countries, they are figuring out what is permissible to make sure that ISIL is not successful and that it is something that Turkey can live with,' he added, using an acronym for the group.","In a series of images, a lone ISIS militant can first be seen standing by the flag on Tilsehir hill near the Turkish border .

"George W. Bush appeared to take aim at his successor President Obama in an interview aired today - as he suggested the draw down of troops in Iraq had allowed ISIS to flourish. Speaking to CBS News in a two-part interview, the 68-year-old former president said he thought it was 'the right decision' to take military action in 2003 in a bid to oust Saddam Hussein. But he added: 'My regret is that…a violent group of people have risen up again…This is ""Al-Qaeda plus""…they need to be defeated. And I hope we do…I hope the strategy works.' Scroll down for video . Former president: George W. Bush (pictured speaking to CBS News in a two-part interview that will air on Sunday) has only one regret about invading Iraq - that it paved the way for the rise of the Islamic State . Militant: Bush told correspondent Bob Schieffer: 'My regret is that…a violent group of people have risen up again…This is ""Al-Qaeda plus""…they need to be defeated.' Above, an ISIS militant in Raqqa, Syria . During the interview with Washington correspondent Bob Schieffer,  Bush also revealed that when he threatened to invade Iraq, then-president Hussein did not take him seriously. 'You know, when he was captured... I was told that the FBI agent that talked to him, he said ""I just didn’t believe Bush,""' he said. 'And it’s hard for me to believe he didn’t believe me.' 'In retrospect…I don’t see how he could doubt my word,' Bush, who is currently promoting his new book, '41: A Portrait Of My Father', which is a biography of his father, George H.W. Bush, added. The 2003 invasion of Iraq, which spanned March 19 to May 1 that year, signaled the start of the Iraq War, which claimed the lives of nearly half a million people. Discussing the war: During the interview, the 68-year-old former president (pictured, right, with Schieffer), said he thought it was 'the right decision' to take military action in 2003 in a bid to oust Saddam Hussein . After the invasion: Bush is pictured addressing the nation aboard the nuclear aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln on May 1, 2003. He declared major fighting over in Iraq, calling it 'one victory in a war on terror' Former Iraqi president: During the interview with Washington correspondent Bob Schieffer, Bush also revealed that when he threatened to invade Iraq, then-president Hussein (pictured) did not take him seriously . In December 2011, under the orders of President Barack Obama, all U.S. troops departed from Iraq, bringing the American mission in the war-torn country to an end. However, in the past few years, ISIS has quickly risen to power in  Iraq and Syria, taking control of swathes of both countries. In June, the terror group overran Mosul, Iraq's second largest city. On Saturday, American warplanes reportedly launched a strike on a gathering of ISIS rebels in al-Qaim, Syria, critically wounding their leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Bush's two-part interview will air on CBS News's Sunday Morning at 9am on Sunday, as well as the channel's 'Face The Nation' at 10.30am the same day. 'Critically injured': On Saturday, American warplanes reportedly launched a strike on a gathering of ISIS rebels in al-Qaim, Syria, critically wounding their leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (pictured) In the biography, Bush also reveals his father, now 90, seriously considered not running for re-election in 1992, even though he loved his job. This is because he felt his role was creating scrutiny of his son, Neil Bush, who was facing a federal lawsuit. 'It killed him to see Neil singled out because he was the President's son,' Bush wrote. The book also discusses George H.W. Bush's decision to launch the first war in Iraq in 1991, his early failures in politics and his stinging defeat to Bill Clinton  in 1992.

"The US Defense Department is investigating video footage appearing to show Islamic State fanatics with at least one cache of weapons airdropped by coalition forces that was meant for Kurdish militiamen battling the extremist group in a border town. The cache of weapons included hand grenades, ammunition and rocket-propelled grenade launchers, according to a video uploaded by a media group loyal to the Islamic State (ISIS) group. The video appeared authentic and corresponded to The Associated Press' reporting of the event. At one point a fighter in the video says: 'Thanks be to God! Spoils and booty for the mujahideen.' The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which bases its information on a network of activists on the ground, said the militants had seized at least one cache. Scroll down for video . A still from an Islamic State (ISIS) video, purportedly shows an IS militant displaying the content of a crate carrying grenades near the town of Ain al-Arab, known by the Kurds as Kobane, on the Syria-Turkey border . A U.S. military airdrop of weapons meant for Kurdish fighters fell into the hands of their jihadist foes near the Syrian battleground town of Kobane, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said . The caches were airdropped early Monday to Kurds in the embattled Syrian town of Kobane that lies near the Turkish border. The militant group has been trying to seize the town for over a month now, causing the exodus of some 200,000 people from the area into Turkey. While Kurds are battling on the ground, a U.S.-led coalition is also targeting the militants from the air. On Tuesday, ISIS loyalists on social media posted sarcastic thank you notes to the United States, including one image that said 'Team USA.' The caches were airdropped early Monday to Kurds in the embattled Syrian town of Kobani that lies near the Turkish border . A container filled with meals ready to eat and fresh water being dropped from a C-130 Hercules during an operational resupply airdrop near the area of Bayji, Iraq . But the lost weapons drop was more an embarrassment than a great strategic loss. The Islamic State militants already possess millions of dollars-worth of U.S. weaponry that they captured from fleeing Iraqi soldiers when the group seized swaths of Iraq in a sudden sweep in June. On Tuesday, the U.S. Central Command said U.S. military forces conducted four airstrikes near Kobani that destroyed IS fighting positions, an IS building and a large IS unit. Also Tuesday, Syrian government airstrikes hit a rebel-held town along the country's southern border with Jordan, killing at least eight people. Militant: Particular blackspots for ISIS checkpoints are the roads around the militants' strongholds in Raqqa and Deir ez-Zor, as well as a number of major highways in eastern Syria. Checkpoints: ISIS militants are forcing vehicles carrying food and medical supplies in Syria and Iraq to pay to continue their journey unhindered . Activists with the Local Coordination Committees and the Observatory said the number of those killed was likely to rise as there are more victims under the rubble. The LCC said Syrian government planes dropped crude explosives-laden canisters on the town of Nasib on the Syria-Jordan border. The airstrikes are part of battles between Syrian government forces and Islamic rebel groups for control of the area. Syrian government forces have been heavily bombing rebel areas in recent weeks, while the U.S-led coalition has been conducting airstrikes against Islamic State militants elsewhere in Syria. An American journalist has been killed in a car crash in Turkey just days after claiming she claimed the Turkish intelligence services had threatened her over her reporting of the siege of Kobane. Serena Shim, who worked for Iran's state-owned Press TV as Turkey correspondent, died in the city of Suruc after the car in which she was travelling reportedly collided with a 'heavy vehicle'. Shim's death came just days after she spoke on camera of her fears of being arrested, claiming Turkish intelligence agents had accused her of spying after one of her reports suggested ISIS militants were being smuggled back and forth over the Syrian border in the back of aid vehicles. Tragic: Serena Shim, who worked for Iran's state-owned Press TV as Turkey correspondent, died in the city of Suruc after the car in which she was travelling reportedly collided with a 'heavy vehicle' Shim, an American citizen of Lebanese origin, had been working in Turkey for Press TV - the Iranian state-owned television network. In a report published on the company's website, it is claimed she had been in a rental car on the way back to her hotel in the town of Suruc in Urfa Province when the 'suspicious' accident took place. Neither the 'heavy vehicle' nor the driver involved in the crash have been located after the incident, Press TV claimed, adding that her parents 'refused to believe' the crash had been an accident and are planning to pursue the matter legally. Press TV's account of the crash has been somewhat disputed by Turkish newspaper Hurriyet Daily News, however, who said the vehicle involved was a cement mixer and that the as-yet-unidentified driver had been arrested at the scene. Death: Serena Shim's death came just days after she spoke on camera of her fears of being arrested, claiming Turkish intelligence agents had accused her of spying . Only last Friday Shim was interviewed on camera by Press TV about her fears of being arrested by Turkish intelligence agencies. In the short interview she alleged that she had been approached and accused of spying after a report in which he said she claimed to have received images of Islamic State terrorists being smuggled over the Turkey-Syria in vehicles belonging to the World Food Organization and other aid groups. Shim described herself as 'surprised' at the accusation, 'because I have nothing to hide and I have never done anything aside my job.'","Video appears to show IS soldiers with American-supplied arms .

"Vow: David Cameron will today pledge that Britain will lead a global fightback against antibiotic-resistant superbugs . David Cameron has vowed Britain will lead a global fightback against antibiotic-resistant superbugs. The Prime Minister said concerted action was needed to prevent the world from being 'cast back into the dark ages of medicine'. The rise of untreatable bacteria is one of the biggest health threats facing the world, threatening an 'unthinkable scenario' where minor infections could once again kill. Tens of thousands of people are already dying of infections that have evolved resistance to common treatments. The World Health Organisation has warned that routine operations and minor scratches could become fatal if nothing is done. Mr Cameron said: 'For many of us, we only know a world where infections or sicknesses can be quickly remedied by a visit to the doctor and a course of antibiotics. 'This great British discovery has kept our families safe for decades, while saving billions of lives around the world. 'But that protection is at risk as never before. 'Resistance to antibiotics is now a very real and worrying threat, as bacteria mutates to become immune to its effect.' He warned 25,000 people in Europe already die every year from infections resistant to anti-biotic drugs. 'Tthis is not some distant threat but something happening right now', he added. 'If we fail to act, we are looking at an almost unthinkable scenario where antibiotics no longer work and we are cast back into the dark ages of medicine where treatable infections and injuries will kill once again. 'That simply cannot be allowed to happened and I want to see a stronger, more coherent global response, with nations, business and the world of science working together to up our game in the field of antibiotics. 'Following discussions at the G7 last month, I have asked the economist Jim O’Neil to work with a panel of experts and report back to me and other world leaders on how we can accelerate the discovery and development of a new generation of antibiotics.' Mr Cameron has become the first world leader to speak out about the threat of antibacterial resistence. It follows his stand on dementia. Last month he pledged further funding to beat the disease. The Prime Minister believes he has the agreement of Barack Obama and Angela Merkel for co-ordinated action to find new drugs after raising the issue with them privately at a G7 summit last month. Jim O’Neill, the former chief economist at Goldman Sachs, will lead an international group of experts aiming to spur the development of a 'new generation of antibiotics'. Scroll down for video .

Issue: The Prime Minister believes he has the agreement of Barack Obama and Angela Merkel for co-ordinated action to find new drugs after raising the issue with them privately at a G7 summit last month . Only five new types of antibiotics have been introduced since the 1960s and the supply of newly-developed drugs is dwindling as companies see little profit in working on treatments designed only to be used as a last resort. Mr Cameron said: 'I’ve been listening to the scientific advice that I get, and the network of advisers we have are all saying this is one of the most serious health problems the world faces. 'For many of us we only know a world where infections or sicknesses can be quickly remedied by a visit to the doctor and a course of antibiotics. This great British discovery has kept our families safe for decades, while saving billions of lives around the world. 'But that protection is at risk as never before. Resistance to antibiotics is now a very real and worrying threat.' Professor Dame Sally Davies, the chief medical officer for England, said: 'We must act now on a global scale to slow down antimicrobial resistance. 'In Europe, at least 25,000 people a year already die from infections which are resistant to our drugs of last resort. New antibiotics made by the biotech and pharmaceutical industry will be central to resolving this crisis which will impact on all areas of modern medicine.

Symptoms of Ebola may appear anywhere from 2 to 21 days after exposure to the virus, but the average is 8 to 10 days. Patients suffering the illness may experience high fever, severe headache and muscle pain, diarrhea and vomiting, abdominal pain and unexplained bleeding. Ebola is spread through direct contact with blood or other bodily fluids, and objects that have been contaminated with the virus. People who recover from Ebola develop antibodies that last for at least 10 years.","An unnamed patient is being kept in isolation at Howard University Hospital in Washington DC .

But Camilla's jewellery wasn't as eye-catching as her choice of head wear. She wore a side hat embellished with leaf shapes that rose above her head by at least an inch. She arrived her husband the Prince of Wales who had opted for a royal blue suit and tie. The Earl of Wessex, who celebrated his 50th birthday today, was also among the royal party and was joined by his wife the Countess of Wessex.

"Halloween week is traditionally a time for creepy tales, but pop star Katie Melua has a real-life horror story to top the lot. The 30-year-old had been bugged by a scratching noise – and when she went to the doctor’s to get it checked out, she discovered to her shock that it was caused by a spider living inside her ear. Even more alarmingly, it had been there for a week. Creature discomforts: Katie Melua, pictured during a concert, noticed a rustling noise after using earphones on a flight . Grisly proof: Ms Melua posted this image of her unwanted guest after it had been 'hoovered' out of her ear by a hearing specialist . Melua – who once released a single called Spider’s Web – believes the creature had previously been living in a pair of earbud headphones she recently used. Once the doctor had removed the creature with a suction device, Ms Melua posted pictures of the unnerving find on Instagram. She wrote alongside the picture: ‘Basically I used these old in-ear monitors to block out sound on a flight, a little spider must have been in them and crawled inside my ear and stayed there for the week. ‘Though the thing looked terrifying up-close on the doctor’s camera, once he took him out (using a micro-hoover) it was pretty small, and now it’s in this little test tube, alive and seemingly fine.’ And showing a surprising sang-froid, she added: ‘It was no hassle at all, apart from the occasional shuffling noises.’ A spokeswoman for the star, best known for hits such as Nine Million Bicycles and The Closest Thing To Crazy, said: ‘The ear specialist said he’d never in his career taken out a live bug before. Plenty of dead ones. When it was out it was pretty tiny. ‘Katie kept it in the test tube and released it in her garden when she got home. Apart from shuffling and random noises in her ear, the spider was no bother for the entire week it lived there. She was relieved it was what it was as she was worried she was losing her hearing.’ Miss Melua told her followers on Twitter and Instagram about the arachnid that was removed from her ear . The Spider's Web singer believes the creature crawled into her ear from the headphones she was using . The spider was identified as a member of the jumping spider family, which are found worldwide . The spider may look small, but it caused some discomfort for the Nine Million Bicycles singer . The news comes two weeks after The Mail on Sunday reported how a London family found a deadly Brazilian spider delivered with bananas in their Waitrose shopping order. Ms Melua’s intruder was identified as a member of the salticidae – or jumping spider – family. They are common worldwide, but in Britain they rarely grow bigger than half an inch. Experts were, however, divided about how the spider might have survived for so long. Dr Tim Cockerill, who presents the BBC series Spider House, said: ‘I have never heard of this before. ‘But lots of spiders don’t need to feed as frequently as you think. At this time of year spiders have been eating flies and are very well fed so they can survive weeks and weeks without food. ‘I don’t think there is anything in anybody’s ear that spiders would like to feed on.’ But Professor Brian Moore, a hearing expert at Cambridge University, said: ‘Spiders like nice warm and slightly moist places and the ear can provide that. We often have very small lice and bed mites which get into our ear which a spider could live on.’ But he had some relatively comforting news: ‘Eventually the spider would come out and lay its eggs in a suitable place – and I don’t think that would be the ear.’ In 2012, a woman in China discovered a spider had been living in her ear canal for five days. Doctors retrieved it by pouring a salt solution into her ear. But last year sculptor Graeme Lougher from West Sussex wasn’t so lucky when doctors removed a live spider from his ear. The creature immediately shot up his nose and his ordeal only ended when he sneezed it out.","Katie Melua had a jumping spider living in her ear for an entire week .

"An astonishing video has shown the moment that a family's cat came to the rescue of their four-year-old son after he was viciously attacked by a neighbor's dog. Jeremy Triantafilo was sitting on his bicycle outside his family's home in Bakersfield, California on Tuesday when the dog escaped its home through an open gate and crept up on him from behind. Surveillance footage, which Jeremy's father uploaded to YouTube, shows the dog grabbing the boy's leg and pulling him to the ground before violently shaking him with his teeth clamped tight.

"Treavor Eimers says his father had moved from Michigan to Key West to live out his days enjoying the beach, but his retirement came to an abrupt and tragic end during a routine traffic stop last year. Charles Eimers, a retired 61-year-old autoworker, died in police custody after being arrested outside a Pizza Hut in Key West last Thanksgiving. 'He was murdered by those officers,' his son told CBS This Morning. Scroll down for video . Seeking justice: Treavor Eimers (left) claims his 61-year-old father, Charles Eimers (right), was asphyxiated by police officers after he was pulled over for a traffic violation last Thanksgiving . Eimers was pulled over November 28, 2013, outside a Pizza Hut on North Roosevelt Boulevard in Key West for reckless driving . What followed Mr Eimers' sudden passing was a series of conflicting reports from law enforcement officials, paramedics and the hospital, leading Treavor Eimers to suspect that there might be a cover-up afoot. Charles Eimers' deadly encounter with Key West police November 28 was caught on video recorded by a passerby, which shows the man emerging from his car on his own and then surrendering by laying face-down on the beach. The footage shows a group of more than a dozen officers surrounding the prostrate man and forming a wall around him. In a police report, the 13 officers wrote that Eimers was pulled over outside the Pizza Hut on North Roosevelt Boulevard for reckless driving, but he fled the scene. The documents stated that the 61-year-old man was charged with resisting an officer with violence. But a report filed by paramedics who responded to the scene stated that a police officer told EMT workers that Eimers ran from his car and then collapsed unconscious on the beach. Evidence: This cell phone video shot by a passerby shows Eimers emerging from his car (left) and then laying face-down on the beach as 13 police officers descend on him with their guns drawn . Conflicting stories: Officers wrote in their reports that the 61-year-old man violently resisted arrest, but an EMT claimed that one of the cops told him Eimers collapsed unconscious on the beach . Then again, hospital records obtained by CBS indicated that the 61-year-old retiree 'was found without a pulse by police' and later passed away from lack of oxygen to the brain. But the eyewitness video shot with a cell phone clearly shows Charles Eimers walking by himself and calmly surrendering to armed police officers. The man was taken to Lower Keys Medical Center and placed on life support, but according to Treavor Eimers, he was not notified about his father's hospitalization until four days later in violation of standing police procedures. After the son ordered his father taken off the respirator, he says he was certain that a medical examiner would evaluate his body under a state law requiring an autopsy on anyone who dies in police custody. Close call: After his son took Eimers off life support, his body was supposed to be autopsied, but instead it was taken directly to this funeral home and nearly cremated . But instead of sending his remains to the medical examiner's office, police shipped Charles Eimers directly to a funeral home where the deceased narrowly avoided cremation. Monroe County Medical Examiner E. Hunt Scheuerman eventually autopsied Eimers' body, concluding in his preliminary report released to Miami Herald last month that the 61-year-old Michigan transplant suffered 10 broken ribs and bruises on both his wrists from the handcuffs. ‘I believe that my father was asphyxiated on the beach in Key West by the officers involved that day,’ said Eimers’ son, a former critical care nurse. The Key West site TheBluePaper.com, which has been following the case, reported that Eimers' tissue samples have been destroyed. In the week after the arrest, some of the 13 officers involved in the case submitted additional reports stating that the 61-year-old violently struggled to get free. Treavor Eimers said his father's record was far from spotless, with multiple run-ins with the law in the 1990s on charges of domestic abuse and theft, but he cannot understand how a simple traffic stop could have resulted in his death. Checkered past: Charles Eimers, a 20-year veteran of Michigan's automotive industry, had had several run-ins with the law in the 90s on theft and domestic abuse charges . Both the Key West Police Department and the Florida Department of Law Enforcing have been investigating the Eimers case over the past six months. ‘We want to be able to provide answers to the Eimers family. We want to provide answers to this community. And we want the police officers who are involved to be able to move on from this situation as well.’ Key West Police Chief Donald Lee Jr told CBS. However, Eimers' family and other critics of the law enforcement officials handing the case have pointed to a possible conflict of interest stemming from the fact that lead investigator, Kathy Smith, is the ex-wife of Captain Scott Smith, the supervisor of the arresting officers.","Charles Eimers, 61, was pronounced dead from lack of oxygen to the brain four days after he was arrested November 28 on a Key West beach .

"Doorknobs have been banned in Vancouver, Canada and many residents are up in arms over the new nanny-state rule. Starting next March, the city will be requiring the installation of lever handles on all new building doors instead of round doorknobs. The City Council passed the new code in September in an attempt to make the city more accessible to the disabled and elderly. Out with the old, in with the new: The Vancouver City Council amended its building code to ban doorknobs (left) in favor of lever handles (right) to make housing more elderly-friendly . The change was part of the council's 'age-friendly action plan'. In addition to the door handle requirement, the city has passed similar building requirements such as wider door frames, faucet levers and minimum height standards for electrical outlets to create 'a more safe, inclusive and engaging city for all seniors'. With Americans and Canadians living longer, age-related issues are coming to the forefront especially as the Baby Boomer generation enters retirement. According to the CDC, 67 million adult Americans will have arthritis by 2030. 'Technology changes. Things change. We live with that,' Will Johnston, the city's former chief building inspector, told the Vancouver Sun. 'When I look at what we are proposing, it is simply good design. It allows for homes to be built that can be used more easily for everybody.' The new code isn't retroactive and doesn't apply to current buildings, but it has still angered many who don't like the idea of their government dictating such a minor detail in their homes. 'I can understand if you have a public building where everybody wants to have free access and that is a problem,' said Allen Joslyn, president of the antique door knob collectors of America. 'But to say that when I build my private home and nobody is disabled that I have to put levers on, strikes me as overreach.' Foreshadowing: Leading up to the vote, all of the Art Deco doorknobs in Vancouver City Hall were swapped out for gold levers . Vancouver councilman Geoff Meggs admits that the measure 'went through very quietly' but isn't sorry it's now a part of the building code. 'This is all about [enhancing] accessibility, and it's something we're going to keep doing. I'm not going to apologize for that,' Mr Meggs told the National Post. Signs of change led up to the vote in September when all of the Art Deco door knobs in Vancouver City Hall were removed and replaced with gold door levels. Mr Meggs says the city has been fielding calls about the latest change to the building code, but that most are people asking about where they can purchase the old City Hall door knobs. While the rule applies only to single-family homes and townhouses in city limits, the Vancouver Sun hypothesized that the change would effect all of Canada. Since Vancouver is the only Canadian city with its own building code, it is used as an example for other towns and cities in the country.","The Vancouver City Council amended the building code in September to ban doorknobs in all new buildings .

"A boy of 15 sat laughing beside his mother in the dock yesterday as he was jailed for the ‘primeval’ murder of a market trader. Karlton Burton grinned and shouted ‘see ya guys’ when he was led down to the cells after being convicted of stabbing Rashid Naeem to death. He and his accomplice, Javauntee Campbell, stole two watches from Mr Naeem’s street stall, taunting the 29-year-old father of two with the words: ‘Are you scared?’ Karlton Burton, 15, (left) was sentenced to a minimum of 15 years for stabbing Rashid Naeem. Accomplice Javauntee Campbell, 16, (right) was sentenced to 10 years after being convicted of manslaughter . When Mr Naeem confronted them, Burton knifed him in the heart in front of shoppers and terrified children. Campbell, 16, pushed the trader to the ground and punched his brother Sajid. The pair ran off, leaving their victim bleeding heavily. He died in hospital. Burton, who was associated with gangs, was on bail at the time for attacking a rival’s car with an axe. Yesterday Judge Richard Hone QC allowed him to sit next to his mother in the Old Bailey dock for her to try to control his behaviour. He is said to have an attention deficit disorder and the maturity of an 11-year-old. Despite the special measures, the thug, who is obsessed with knives and computer games such as Call of Duty and Grand Theft Auto, continued to laugh, whispering to his mother and calling out to his friends in the public gallery. The judge sentenced Burton to life imprisonment with a minimum of 15 years, saying: ‘You were aged just 14 when you committed the murder of Rashid Naeem. ‘By your actions that Sunday you have in effect passed a life sentence on all the members of your victim’s close and devoted family. Rashid Naeem has two young children who will never again see their father. The pain and devastation you have caused to all these people is beyond description. ‘In that primeval second of anger and stabbing there is probably no distinction between an intent to really seriously injure with a knife, and an intention to kill.’ Judge Hone said Burton had orchestrated the attack on Mr Naeem in ‘retaliation for some perceived disrespect’. He added: ‘This offence was committed in a Sunday public market with families and children present. You have a background which includes associating with gangs carrying knives. Father-of-two  Rashid Naeem was knifed during a struggle near his stall in Queen's Market, east London . Police made history by charging three boys with murder before the victim had died, one has been cleared . ‘There is a really bad streak in your character which means you overreact to perceived insults.’ The court heard Burton’s mother feared that he was turning into a gangster and she had struggled to control his behaviour. On February 16, Burton, Campbell and a 15-year-old boy who cannot be named, approached Mr Naeem’s stall in Queens Market in East Ham, East London, where he sold used mobile phones, watches and clocks. When the trader nervously moved his phones into a display box, Burton taunted him and, with Campbell, grabbed two watches and made off with the other boy. Campbell handed his watch back but a few minutes later the boys were captured on CCTV returning to the stall. As Mr Naeem and his brother approached the defendants, Burton reached down to his ankle and withdrew a knife from his sock, concealing it in his jacket. When he was asked to return the watch, Burton stabbed Mr Naeem in the chest. In a legal first, all three boys were charged with murder even before Mr Naeem had died because doctors said he could not survive his injuries. Scotland Yard issued an extraordinary statement saying: ‘His injuries will prove fatal and consequently the three youths have been accused of murder.’ Just a few hours later, Mr Naeem’s life support machine was switched off at the Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel. At a trial in July, Burton was convicted of murder and possession of a knife while Campbell was convicted of manslaughter. The third boy was cleared of murder. Campbell, who appeared in court by video link from Feltham Prison, showed no reaction as he was sentenced to ten years in a young offenders institution. He will serve half his term before being released on licence. The court heard he had been led astray by Burton who had pictures of a knife and suspected drugs on his Facebook page. Giving evidence in his defence, Campbell said: ‘I asked him [Burton] “Did you poke the guy?” He said “No I don’t think so, it did not go in”.’ Burton claimed he had been acting in self-defence, a plea which was rejected by the jury.","Karlton Burton, now 15, plunged a knife into the chest of Rashid Naeem, 29 .

"A Canadian teenager who ran a 'sophisticated' prostitution ring when she was just 15 has been jailed for six-and-a-half years. Kailey Oliver-Machado, now 18, would lure girls as young as 13 from the Walkley housing complex in Ottawa on Facebook and Twitter saying they would be paid to attend parties and sleepovers. But the victims would actually be plied with drugs and made to pose for semi-naked photos that would be sent to johns. They would then be confined in small rooms, forced to perform sex acts and were threatened with violence if they didn't. Sentenced: Kailey Oliver-Machado, now 18, from Ottawa, who ran a 'sophisticated' prostitution ring involving girls as young as 13 when she was just 15 has been jailed for six-and-a-half years. Shocking: The Canadian teenager would lure girls as young as 13 from Ottawa on Facebook and Twitter saying they would be paid to attend parties. But they would be plied with drugs and forced to perform sex acts . Some would even arrive at the houses with their teddy bears and pajamas, thinking they were just sleeping over with a friend. When they were there they would be taken in a taxi to the john's home where they would pay around $400 to have sex with them. Oliver-Machado was found guilty of 27 charges at trial including human trafficking, sexual assault and making and possessing child pornography. She was one of three girls who were responsible for the ring. The others can't be named because of their ages. While in pre-trial custody she was completing high school credits and said she was interested in gardening. However Justice Diane Lahaie slapped her down, saying she was 'highly intelligent' and was only saying that to get a lesser sentence. She added that the system Oliver-Macahdo ran was 'sophisticated and well-organized human trafficking enterprise that included wardrobes and client lists'. Pose: She was one of three girls who were responsible for the ring. The others can't be named because of their ages . Luring: Oliver-Machado would message potential victims on Facebook with a 'party invite' Location: She ran what a judge referred to as a 'well-organized' system in this South End neighborhood in the Canadian capital . Lahaie said she chose to sentence her as an adult because a youth sentence would not properly reflect the seriousness of her crimes. The trial, which began in April 2013, heard from three teenage girls who were forced to perform sex acts and hand over the money they earned. Four other teens testified about a range of experiences, including being recruited online to sell their bodies. Authorities said there could have been as many as nine victims. Speaking to CBC, Sergeant Kelly Kyle from Ottawa Police said: 'We saw the pain that it caused and that was recognized today.' The court heard last month that the youngest victim said she suffered nightmares as a result and was diagnosed with PTSD, and ultimately had to leave Ottawa. Oliver-Machado was given credit for the time she has already served in pre-trial custody. It means she will be released in around three years. She was tried as an adult and received the maximum sentence.

"Two Polish siblings tortured their elderly mother to death during an exorcism which they believed would rid her of ‘the devil’, when in fact the 75-year-old had Alzheimer’s. Piotr Majewski, 38, and Barbara Majewski, 39, from Ostrowiec, in south-central Poland, claimed they thought their 75-year-old mother was possessed by demons. The brother and sister carried out a violent ritual on their mother Irena which left her with broken ribs, a shattered jaw and severe brain trauma. 'Exorcism': Piotr, 38, and Barbara Majewski, 39, from Ostrowiec, Poland, left their mother Irena, 75, with broken ribs, a shattered jaw and severe brain trauma . The Majewski siblings tied their mother to a bed and carried out religious rituals, before proceeding to beating and torturing her to rid her of ‘the devil’. In fact, the 75-year-old suffered from Alzheimer’s. The brother and sister are now facing 12 years in jail for the murder of their mother. The Majewskis later told police the spirit of their late father was the channel between Irena and the devil, who wanted her soul. ‘They said at first they tried to banish his spirit from the house, and when that failed went ahead with the full blown exorcism,’ said a police spokesman. ‘They tied her to a bed, put a cross on her head and forced her to drink holy water and renounce the devil. Horror: The siblings believed their mother was possessed by the devil, so tied her to a bed and tortured her to drive out the demons (stock image) ‘When she told them she had had no contact with either Satan or her dead husband, they began beating and torturing her,’ said local prosecutor Miroslaw Cebula said. The popular belief is that demons are cowards, and cannot stand pain, which will see them fleeing a human host. An autopsy showed that Irena Majewski died from broken ribs, a shattered jaw and severe brain trauma. Exorcism is one of three types of sacramentals listed by the Catholic Church, alongside blessings and consecrations/dedications. Guidelines issued in 1999 by the Vatican states that Catholic exorcisms can only be carried out on a person claiming to be possessed by demons or the devil after an evaluations by a doctor ton rule out a mental of physical illness.","Polish siblings tortured their 75-year-old mother to death .

"Conservative David Bishop, who was standing in the Brentwood Borough Council elections made homophobic and anti-Islamic comments on Twitter . A Conservative candidate has quit the party after posting anti-Islamic and homophobic comments on Twitter. David Bishop, who was due to stand in this month’s council ­elections, resigned after attacking the religion for a ‘psychopathic level of misogyny’ and saying it was ‘good to be anti-Islam’. Bishop also retweeted a message which read: ‘How can a gay guy keep a straight face?’ Last night, Bishop apologised for any offence he had caused and confirmed he would not be standing for election to Brentwood Borough Council in Essex on May 22. A Tory Party spokesman added that Bishop’s views had ‘no place in our team’. The news comes after a Ukip council candidate was facing suspension earlier this week for posting a stream of ‘crackpot’ homophobic and anti-Muslim comments on Twitter and Facebook. Harry Perry, who is standing in Stockport, said ‘Islam is evil,’ claimed homosexuality was an ‘abomination before God’ and described David Cameron as a ‘gay-loving nutcase’. Mr Perry’s comments came to light after he sent a private message to the Liberal Democrat general election candidate, Lisa Smart, on Facebook. One of them said all three mainstream parties were seeking to ‘change our culture as fast as possible without permission from the white indigenous population’, before adding: ‘Don’t you know Lisa that God hates ­homosexuality, you cannot be a Christian and support the gay issue.’ The revelations will heap ­further embarrassment on Ukip leader Nigel Farage . Ukip deputy leader Paul Nuttall confirmed the party would investigate. The tweets emerged as the Prime Minister attacked Nigel Farage’s party as ‘discredited’. The revelations will heap ­further embarrassment on Ukip after another candidate, in North London, tweeted that comedian Lenny Henry should emigrate to a ‘black ­country’ and compared Islam to the Third Reich. William Henwood later resigned his membership of the party.","David Bishop was due to stand in council elections in Brentwood, Essex .

"An online petition urging politicians to create a bank holiday for Hindu festival Diwali and Muslim celebration Eid has attracted more than 119,000 signatures and could be debated in the House of Commons. If applied, it would be the first . non-Christian religious holidays in Britain and could lead to calls from . other faiths for their events to also be recognised. As the e-petition has reached 100,000 signatures it has to be considered in parliament under rules set up in 2011. Plea: A petition to the House of Commons has urged politicians to consider having a bank holiday for the Hindu festival of Diwali and the Muslim celebration, Eid . Nationalists have complained that St George’s Day and St David’s Day are not holidays but an e-petition calling for these days to be marked has only 34 signatures. Diwali is described as the 'Festival of Lights' and is celebrated by Hindus in the Autumn while Eid is held at the end of Ramadan when Muslims break their fast. Details of the petition are said to have been passed to the Backbench Business Committee, which will ­consider its suitability for debate. Set up by Jon Timmis, it states: 'I believe that, given the number of Muslims and Hindus in this country it is only fair we allow them to have the most important days in their faiths recognised in law.' Backing: The petition was set up by Jon Timmis and has attracted 119, 605 signatures . The e-petition has sparked widespread debate on internet forums and social media, especially those aimed at British ­Muslims and Hindus. While religious and community leaders have ­distanced themselves from the idea, popular opinion is evenly split. Vinod Popat, chairman of The ­British Hindu Voice, told the Sunday Express: 'I don’t think it is a very good idea. How many festivals are there for other religions. Should they all be marked with a ­public holiday?' He also pointed out that Diwali is set on a lunar calender, so would fall on a different day every year. David . Jones said on Twitter: 'Now Parliament want to introduce public bank . holidays for muslims and hindu's- this is the UK don't like it leave.' Critics have also suggested there are enough problems with Easter, which can . take place any time over a four-week period as its timing depends on . the full moon and spring equinox. Celebration: David Cameron joins a ceremony marking Diwali at a Hindu temple in 2013. The 'Festival of Lights' is held every Autumn . However, Suleman Nagdi, of the Federation of Muslim Organisations in Leicester, told the paper: 'Any move to recognise other faiths is a good thing but I do not think there should be a public holiday.' Graham Smith, who launched the St George Unofficial Bank Holiday campaign, has accused recent Labour and Conservative governments of anti-English bias. He said: 'They just don’t seem to want to grasp English nationalism, they are afraid of it for some reason.' Britiain has eight days of bank holidays every year, the second lowest in the world behind Mexico.","Online petition requesting day off for Eid and Diwali has 119,000 signatures .

"France put on a breath-taking fireworks display last night to mark Bastille Day and 100 years since the start of the First World War. The pyrotechnics show in Paris saw 300 projectors bathe the Eiffel Tower in light the colours of soldiers' uniforms to pay homage to the millions who lost their lives during the conflict. It was held as simultaneous displays lit up towns and cities all over the country. Earlier soldiers marched in the distinctive blue uniform of France's First World War army down the Champs Elysee towards the Arc de Triomphe in tribute to the dead. The French government had invited troops from 76 countries who were all involved in the conflict, regardless of which side they fought on. Spectacular: Fireworks explode around the Eiffel Tower during the annual Bastille Day celebrations in Paris . The French National Day commemorates the beginning of the French Revolution with the storming of the Bastille fortress and prison on July 14, 1789 . Bastille Day fireworks explode over the Seine river next to the Eiffel Tower in Paris (left) and over the pond and the old town of Gruissan, southern France (right) Bastille Day commemorates the storming by Parisians of the Bastille prison on July 14, 1789, setting off the French Revolution that toppled King Louis XVI and put an end to monarchy . Fireworks burst over the pond and the old town of Gruissan, southern France, as part of the country's annual Bastille Day celebrations . The pyrotechnics show in Paris saw 300 projectors bathe the Eiffel Tower in light the colours of soldiers' uniforms . The symbolic gesture was intended as a powerful symbol of peace and to remember the sacrifice of those killed and wounded in the war. President Francois Hollande said: 'Ten million soldiers were killed or died of their injuries on countless battlefields. We owe them gratitude,' President Francois Hollande said in a message ahead of the march. The message took on special meaning amid renewed violence in Gaza and Iraq, and as French troops fight extremists in Africa. Three soldiers of each of the 76 countries marched along the cobblestones in their national dress uniform. Surrounding them were rows of French troops in sky-blue period uniforms of the 'Poilus,' the name given to French infantrymen of World War I. The ceremony echoed the first celebration of Bastille Day after the end of what was then known as 'The Great War,' in 1919.

French President Francois Hollande, left, stands beside the French Army's chief of staff Pierre de Villiers, right as they review troops along the Champs Elysees . Historian Antoine Prost said: 'The war's wounded were at the forefront of the parade in their wheelchairs ... We celebrated the greatness of the French military by putting first the most visible victims,' recalled historian Antoine Prost. A French army choir interpreted two popular songs of the Poilus - one telling the story of soldiers flirting with a pretty waitress in a tavern - before raising their voices in the national anthem, 'La Marseillaise.' While young people from all invited countries closed Monday's ceremony with a peace dance and a release of doves, the annual event is also about demonstrating France's military might. President Hollande, pictured, said that more than ten million troops died across countless battlefields during four-year long conflict: 'We owe them gratitude,' he said . Three British soliders were among the 76 nations who took part in today's Bastille Day parade celebrations marking the anniversary of the storming of the Paris prison . More than 3,700 soldiers, 50 aircraft, 280 military vehicles and 240 horses of the French national guard participated in the parade, which paid homage to forces serving overseas. France currently has a strong military presence in Africa with 3,000 soldiers in the Sahel region of northern Africa fighting extremists, and 2,000 in Central African Republic trying to help quell sectarian violence. Among the international visitors marched representatives of former French colonies, paying homage to the 600,000 colonial soldiers who served on France's side during World War I, mainly from Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco and Senegal. All those who lost lives in Europe during the war were invited, no matter what was then the status of the territories at the time, the French president's office explained, in an effort to quash an emerging controversy over the presence of Algerian soldiers. Some members of the French far right and Algerian independence movement objected to their presence, because memories of Algeria's war for independence remain painful on both sides of the Mediterranean a half-century later. Bastille Day marks the July 14, 1789, storming of the Bastille prison by angry Paris crowds that helped spark the French Revolution. The French capital will enjoy a fireworks show Monday night, exceptionally fired from the Eiffel Tower. Festive balls - often mixing old-fashioned accordion tunes with trendy dance music - and fireworks are also held all over the country. And the tradition has stretched beyond French borders, with parties from New Orleans to Australia and beyond. President Hollande used his annual Bastille Day television address to urge Israel to open talks with Hamas and bring an end to violence in Gaza . France is trying to use its diplomatic muscle to help broker a peace deal between Israel and Palestine as part of a lasting Middle East deal . President Hollande said he wanted to avoid  tension between France's Muslim and Jewish communities following clashes outside a Paris synagogue over the weekend . French President Hollande used his speech to urge Israel and Hamas to open talks and implement a cease-fire in Gaza. Hollande is trying to use France's diplomatic weight both to stem violence in the Middle East and to keep the unrest from further fueling tensions in France, where pro-Palestinian demonstrators clashed with security officers at a Paris synagogue Sunday. In his annual Bastille Day television address, he said: 'Israel has the right to its security; Israel can defend itself if it is attacked; but at the same time Israel should show restraint. President Hollande is pushing for a cease-fire and says he is looking for all possible ways to mediate one.

The Alpha jets of the French Air Force wow the crowds as they maintain a tight formation above the Arc de Triomphe . He said in recent days he has been trying 'to convince those who could have an influence on Hamas, on the Gaza Strip, and at the same time putting pressure on Israel.' While France has no diplomatic relations with the Hamas militant group that runs Gaza, President Hollande has spoken about the recent violence with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Tunisian President Moncef Marzouki. He said he didn't want the Israeli-Palestinian conflicted to be 'imported' to France, and strongly criticized Sunday's scuffles at a Paris synagogue. They came after a largely peaceful protest urging Western leaders to do more to press Israel to stop its strikes. 'We cannot have intrusion or efforts at intrusions into places of worship, whether they are synagogues, as happened yesterday, but I would say the same thing for mosques, for churches, or for temples,' he said. 'Religions should be respected, all religions. These places of worship should be protected.' French President Francois Hollande invited soldiers from 76 different countries who were all involved in the First World War to participate in today's colourful parade . All arms of the French military were involved in this parade including these students from the Air Force's special school . President Hollande has suggested that his government will ease taxes for the middle classes, in a National Day interview that urged his fellow citizens to be more self-confident and look on the bright side. During a 40-minute interview with the television channels TF1 and France 2, President Hollande acknowledged that tax was a 'sensitive subject', that the French paid a lot of tax, and that more French people paid income tax now than five years ago. But he said that, this year, around 3 million people would pay less income tax, and more than a million pay none. He added that, this year and next, there would be an 'extra effort for the middle classes', who had been hit hard in recent years and could finally be 'compensated for the efforts that have been made'. 'We will act in such a way that several hundred thousand French people pay less tax,' he said. President Hollande said it was important that all participant nations in the First World War including these Greek soliders should take part in today's parade . An impressive range of military transport helicopters and gun ships flew in formation through the heart of Paris as part of the festivities . However a number of pro-Palestinian protesters held a counter demonstration against Israel during today's Bastille Day parade . President Hollande's popularity ratings have plumbed record lows in the past two years as unemployment has soared over ten per cent - despite measures to ease hiring and firing, and the spending of billions of euros to subsidise jobs for younger and older workers. He had pinned his hopes on the economy picking up, but GDP growth was zero in the first quarter, and economic indicators have suggested little improvement since then; business activity contracted for the second month in a row in June. In the television interview to mark Bastille Day, when a crowd stormed a Paris prison on July 14, 1789, at the outset of the French Revolution, President Hollande said his compatriots were more inclined than some others to put their country down. 'We are very proud but, at the same time, I would say there is a sort of sickness, which is not serious but which can be contagious, whereby we are always lamenting and disparaging,' he said. 'Speak well of your country because, when I'm abroad, people do speak well of France, of what it's doing in the international arena, in the diplomatic sphere, on defence, the operations we have carried out for peace, but also innovation, companies.' The president also cited entrepreneurs, major companies with significant exports, the tourist industry and agriculture. 'We have to fight but, most importantly, we have to have confidence in ourselves,' he said.","The pyrotechnics show in Paris saw 300 projectors bathe the Eiffel Tower in light the colours of soldiers' uniforms .

"She was the American society beauty who captured the heart of a king and changed the course of British and Commonwealth history in the process. Now a stunning collection of jewels that shed light on the extraordinary love affair between Wallis Simpson and King Edward VIII are to go on sale at Sotheby's. Among the pieces to go under the hammer on the 12th December is a silver watch that tells of Simpson's heartbreak after being forced to separate from her future husband in the months leading up to his abdication. Love story: Jewels and mementos belonging to the Duke and Duchess of Windsor will go on sale at Sotheby's . Present: This inscribed silver cigarette case was given to the future Edward VIII by his mother, Queen Mary . The keepsake, which was sent to Edward VIII in 1937, even bears an inscription in Simpson's handwriting, which reads, simply: 'Wallis Easter 28 - III - 37 David'. Also included in the sale are examples from Simpson's magnificent jewellery collection, among them a stunning sapphire bracelet by Cartier that is expected to fetch between £130,000 and £180,000. Other jewels belonging to Simpson include a coral, diamond and emerald torsade choker, made by Cartier for the then Duchess of Windsor in 1949. There is also a stunning pair of diamond, enamel and coral clips commissioned by the royal couple from Van Cleef & Arpels and presented to the Duke's private secretary Anne Segrim as a Christmas gift. But not every piece in the sale . belonged to the American duchess. Also included in the sale are pieces linked . to other members of the Royal Family, including Queen Victoria, her son . Edward VII and his wife Queen Alexandra. Particularly touching is a silver frame presented by the Queen-Empress to the future Edward VIII on his fourth birthday that bears the inscription: 'From Great Grandmama V.R.I 24th May 1899'. Heartbreak: This fob watch was given to the Duke by the Duchess in the months leading up to his abdication . Magnificent: Stunning jewels including a sapphire bracelet and diamond medallion will also be part of the sale . Another gift in the collection, a silver cigarette case, carries an equally affecting message and was given to Edward VIII by his mother, Queen Mary of Teck. The rectangular cigarette case, featuring an elaborate silver basket-work design, has an inscription on the inside that reads: 'Darling David from Mama, God bless you, 1925'. Sotheby's, which achieved a world record sales total when it auctioned the rest of the Duchess of Windsor's jewels in 1987, hopes that the new collection will be similarly well received. 'Sotheby's 1987 landmark sale of the jewels of the Duchess of Windsor remained the most valuable single-owner jewellery sale for almost a quarter of a century and inaugurated a new era in the jewellery auction market,' explained David Bennett, chairman of Sotheby's jewellery division in Europe and the Middle East. 'Three years ago, we witnessed the continuing fascination for this collection when 20 pieces from the original sale reappeared at auction in Sotheby's London and established new price levels. 'We are delighted to present this further selection of attractive jewels and precious objects, which shed light on the Duke's life, and what has been called the greatest love story of the 20th century.' Enduring: After refusing to give Mrs Simpson up, the former Edward VIII abdicated in favour of his brother . Few could have imagined, as the 20th century dawned, that an American socialite would prove the cause of the biggest constitutional crisis the Royal Family - and the UK - has ever faced. But Wallis Simpson was no ordinary socialite and her future husband Edward VIII, no ordinary king. The pair met in January 1934 and twice-divorced Simpson and the then Prince of Wales swiftly fell in love. At first the relationship raised few concerns, Edward was notorious for his affairs with society ladies, but that all changed when George V died on the 20th January 1936. When, the next day, the new King-Emperor chose to watch the proclamation of his accession in the company of Simpson, it became clear that he intended to marry her. This precipitated a crisis, firstly because the political establishment considered a twice-divorced woman an unsuitable consort, and secondly, because Edward was now head of the Church of England, which at the time, did not allow marriages between divorcees. Edward suggested a morganatic marriage which would have prevented Simpson becoming Queen Consort, but the prime ministers of the UK, Australia and South Africa rejected the plan. By early December, the true nature of Simpson's relationship with the King had become public knowledge and she fled the country. Despite attempts by Simpson to get him to reconsider, on the 13th December 1936, Edward abdicated and was succeeded by his brother, George VII. The couple eventually married, a month after Wallis' second divorce was granted, on the 3rd June 1937 in the south of France. Although Edward had been created the Duke of Windsor by his brother and was entitled to the style 'His Royal Highness', his wife was refused the honour and was styled instead as 'Her Grace.'

"A fresh racism row engulfed Ukip tonight after it emerged a candidate described Islam as a 'totalitarian ideology' that is 'against everything modern Britain stands for'. An email sent by Heino Vockrodt to the London council he wants to be elected to also claimed a row of shopping looked like ‘Helmand Province now’ street and referred to cases where ‘Muslims are grooming children to be sex slaves under the eyes of the authorities’. Labour condemned the 'deeply offensive' views which emerged after repeated attempts by Nigel Farage to stress that Ukip is not a racist party. Scroll down for video . Ukip leader Nigel Farage has been stung by claims his party is racist, as the latest remarks from candidate Heino Vockrodt emerged . Ahead of European and local elections next week, Ukip has sought to draw a line under offensive comments made by some members and candidates. Sanya-Jeet Thandi, a youth member who was previously put up to defend the party in television interviews, quit this week accusing Mr Farage of playing the race card to win votes. The latest row centres on comments made in an email by Mr Vockrodt complaining about an alleged planning breach by 'the Afghan community' in Brent, north London. He wrote: ‘Being Muslims, they ignored both refusals and did it anyway.’ He claimed political correctness was preventing the council taking action 'for fear of being called racists, when, just like in all the other cases where Muslims are grooming children to be sex slaves under the eyes of the authorities, the council does nothing'. The row follows the resignation of Sanya-Jeet Thandi who quit Ukip this week, accusing Mr Farage of playing the race card . He claimed the neighbourhood was 'already exploding under the weight of segregation' and shopkeepers had been 'squeezed out by Muslims'. 'The entire parade - once lovely owner/occupier shops - resembles Helmand Province now. Time to call in MI5 and MI6 for sure,' he added. 'Islam is a mono-cultural, totalitarian ideology. It is NOT a religion. It is against multi-culturalism and only promotes its own culture. It is against everything modern Britain stands for.' In the message, sent in the early hours of the morning to the planning enforcement department, he said that while he supported a multi-ethnic society, 'the only culture applicable to this country is British' and warned the council not to ignore the 'winds of change'. The Labour leader of Brent council, Muhammed Butt, said: 'Mr Vockrodt’s odious comments are deeply offensive. 'Nigel Farage keeps claiming Ukip isn’t a racist party, but that’s a hard pill to swallow when its members have put forward an individual with such plainly bigoted views for election to public office. 'In Brent we draw strength from our diversity and the vibrancy it brings, and our community deserves better.' A Ukip spokesman said: 'Ukip is a non-racist, non-sectarian party and all candidates and members are expected to uphold these values. Where evidence is produced to indicate a breach, it will be considered at the earliest opportunity by the national executive committee as part of an established disciplinary procedure.' It is a fresh embarrassment for Ukip as it tries to fend off racism allegations following a series of scandals involving candidates, and a controversial poster campaign warning about Europeans coming to take UK jobs. Party leader Mr Farage has sought to dispel the image, accusing the media of stirring up hatred against Ukip and appearing on a platform alongside a number of the party’s black and ethnic minority candidates. 'I don’t care what you call us but from this moment on, please, do not ever call us a racist party. We are not a racist party,' he declared. But Miss Thandi, of the party’s prominent British Asian Ukip supporters resigned this week saying the party's current direction was 'terrifying'. Mr Farage expressed 'surprise' at Ms Thandi’s departure, suggesting she might have been 'intimidated' into quitting. 'She may have been intimidated, I don’t know quite why she changed her mind,' he told BBC Radio 4’s World at One. 'We hadn’t changed in seven days, had we? Nothing had changed in seven days... She changed in seven days, we didn’t.'","Heino Vockrodt sent email to council he hopes to be elected to .

"A woman who contacted an old friend through Facebook was lured to an isolated shed where she was bound and gagged, told she was going to be a 'sex slave' and raped. William Jameson, who unknown to the victim had a history of violence including manslaughter, attempted murder and child rape, then left her tied up with a rope around her neck. But the 31-year-old civil servant, who cannot be named for legal reasons, managed to free her feet and force her way out of the building with her wrists still tied by electric cable. Jailed for life: William Jameson lured a 'friend' to an isolated shed where she was bound and gagged with electric cable and then raped . She frantically tried to raise the alarm and was seen by the driver of a passenger train as she ran alongside a railway track in Wiltshire waving her bound hands, an image which was caught by the onboard CCTV. She then managed to reach a nearby farmhouse where, distressed and covered in mud and blood, she got help. The victim, who worked in the civil service in Ireland, first met 48-year-old Jameson, who she knew as Liam, in 2004 when they were on a computer course. She had suffered from delusions that a relative was being held against their will in hospital, which married Jameson knew about and preyed upon. He enticed her to England saying he would help free the family member. But he cheated her out of £18,000, saying he needed the money to pay for the relative's 'escape' and to buy some land in Wiltshire which they would sell at a profit. In November last year he took her to a patch of land near the village of Minety, Wiltshire, under the pretence of meeting a nurse with the relative there. But when he got her into the shed, Jameson forced her to the ground and tied her hands and feet with electric cable, binding it behind her back. He put a gag in her mouth and tied a . rope around her neck and started to strangle her, saying she was going . to be his 'sex slave'. Jameson told her he was 'a dangerous and violent man' and that he had been in prison in Belfast for rape and attempted murder. Kerry Barker, prosecuting, told Swindon . Crown Court she offered him more money in a bid to get him to leave her, . but he was not interested and raped her. Jameson was sentenced at Swindon Crown Court (pictured). Unknown to his victim, the 48-year-old had a history of violence including manslaughter, attempted murder and child rape . After he went outside to answer his . phone she heard him leave and the woman managed to free her feet after . removing a shoe and sock. She . then forced the shed door and, with her hands still tied, got to the . railway line before running to a nearby farm to raise the alarm. After . Jameson was arrested police searched his home and found he had more . than 1,500 sickening films and pictures of violent sexual child abuse on . his computer. Jameson, . of Finchampstead, Berkshire, pleaded guilty to rape, false imprisonment . and ten counts of making indecent images of children. Mr . Barker told the court that in 1986 he was jailed for 12 years for . attempted murder, attempted rape, and other sex offences against a . child. He lured an . eight-year-old girl from a Belfast street before putting a belt round . her neck and sexually abusing her, then twice slammed a breeze block . into her head in an attempt to kill her. In 1998 he was jailed for six years in Dublin after a man died when Jameson strangled him in a sex game. The unnamed 31-year-old was tricked into visiting an isolated shed after contacting her 'friend' on Facebook (file photo) Alex Daymond, defending, said his client realised he presented a danger to the public and was facing a lengthy jail term, but urged it to not be a life term. He said Jameson had been abused terribly as a child and while in custody on remand was clean of drugs and was even a 'listener' for other prisoners. Although the shed was kitted out with sex toys he said it was where his client went to act out his alter ego, Julie-Ann, away from his wife and was not set up for the rape. Jailing him for life Recorder Peter Blair QC said: 'You pose a considerable risk of serious harm to the public. This case falls fair and square into one that that demands a sentence of life imprisonment. 'Mr Daymond rightly observes that this sentence should be reserved for the most grave cases - in my judgment this is one of those. 'I am quite simply of the view that there is a significant risk of serious harm to the pubic. Your offences are considerably serious to justify such a sentence. I also take into account your previous convictions.' Jameson will not be allowed to seek parole for five years and must register as a sex offender for life.","William Jameson, 48, had previously been jailed for manslaughter, attempted murder and child rape .

"Two female football fans ripped up pages from the Koran during a match before throwing them in the air ‘like confetti’ while chanting racist songs about Muslims, a court heard. Middlesbrough FC supporters Julie Phillips, 50, and Gemma Parkin, 18, have been found guilty of using religiously aggravated threatening or insulting behaviour while watching their team’s away fixture against Birmingham City on December 7 last year. Magistrates heard that 25 minutes into the second half, Philips pulled a copy of the Muslim holy book from her handbag and started ripping out the pages. Middlesbrough FC supporters Julie Phillips, 50, left, and Gemma Parkin, 18, right, have been found guilty of using religiously aggravated threatening or insulting behaviour while watching their team’s away fixture against Birmingham City on December 7 last year. She then handed them out to other fans sitting in the stands at St Andrew’s stadium who began throwing the torn pages into the air. Philips and Parkin also joined in with anti-Islamic chants about killing Muslims with a bayonet while others pretended to set the book on fire, the court heard. The pair were convicted at Birmingham Magistrates’ Court today following a one-day trial. During the trial, prosecutor Amar Sanghara told the court: ‘On that date Birmingham City Football Club were playing home against Middlesbrough. ‘There was a crowd of 13,454 and 655 were Middlesbrough fans who were standing in the stand behind the goal. ‘A club steward Matthew Corne was stood in the Gill Merrick stand. While there he observed fans ripping pages from a book. ‘They were also chanting words like “Muslim”, “Koran” and “bayonet”. Julie Phillips and Gemma Parkin have been found guilty of using religiously aggravated threatening or insulting  behaviour while watching Middlesbrough v Birmingham City at  St Andrew's stadium, pictured, in December last year . The pair were convicted of ripping out pages of the Koran, pictured, and throwing them in the air 'like confetti' during the Birmingham FC match v Middlesbrough last year . 'Mr Cornes asked them what they were doing and asked the control to get the CCTV cameras to monitor them. ‘The group were followed from the ground and then intercepted by the police. ‘Mrs Phillips was interviewed on January 17 by police when she admitted tearing up the Koran but said she had been handed the book and didn’t know what it was.’ The court heard the pair were among a group of around 20 fans who were chanting racist songs during the Championship league match, which went on to finish 2-2. Giving evidence Matthew Cornes, who was part of the security response team at the game, said: . ‘They were passing pages of the book around and tore the book up. ‘They were throwing them up in the air like confetti. ‘There was shouting going on and singing, I don’t know the words but it was about the Koran and they mentioned Muslims as well. ‘I had never heard chanting like that before.’ Parkin, left, and Phillips, right, were convicted at trial at Birmingham Magistrates’ Court. They were fined a total of £500 and ordered to pay a further £850 between them in court costs and a victim surcharge . Sentencing the pair, chair of the bench Gordon Sayers said: 'Other supporters seemed uncomfortable and this behaviour was in a large stadium with people of all nationalities' John Newbold was working as a steward in the away end on the day and also witnessed pages being ripped from the book. He was on duty in the Gil Merrick stand at the time of the offence and told Birmingham Magistrates’ Court: ‘I was at the back of the stand, when I saw, about four rows in front of me, somebody ripping something up. ‘I went down and asked “what are you ripping up?”. The reply was “the Koran”. “My mate was behind me so I asked him to radio it through to control to keep an eye on it and keep the cameras on them. ‘We followed them at the end of the game to the away car park where the police stopped them and had a word with them.’ Sentencing chair of the bench Gordon Sayers said: ‘Mrs Phillips we have seen clear CCTV evidence you ripped up the Koran and passed pages around the small group around you. ‘You waved pages and tore them up. ‘We are satisfied you were aware of what you were distributing. Mrs Phillips was interviewed on January 17 by police when she admitted tearing up the Koran at the football ground, pictured, but claimed she had been handed the book and didn't know what it was . ‘We have seen you and Mr Newbold's heads move enough for him to ask you and you to shout the Koran. ‘Other supporters seemed uncomfortable and this behaviour was in a large stadium with people of all nationalities. ‘We find your behaviour both abusive and insulting. ‘Miss Parkin we find your version of how you got the Koran unbelievable. ‘You ripped up the Koran and were well aware of what you were doing.’ Phillips was fined £300, told to pay court costs of £400 and a victim surcharge of £30, while Parkin was fined £200, and ordered to pay a further £420 in court costs. Neither were banned from attending future football matches. Earlier today, Phillips told the court she did not know what the book was at the time of the incident. She said: ‘I can remember just being passed a book, I didn't know what it was. ‘I tore it up like confetti as that is what people do at a football match. ‘As we left a policeman then came over and I was mortified when I heard it was the Koran. If I had known I would not have torn it. ‘I am old enough to know not to do something like that. ‘I certainly wouldn't have done it because a lot of Muslims live in Birmingham. ‘There were no racist songs to my knowledge at all.’","Two Middlesbrough FC fans ripped up the Koran at Birmingham FC game .

"Never-before-released Interviews with veteran female CIA officers have given a fascinating insight into women's lives at the heart of the hyper-male and intrinsically secretive world. The four officers, who started as low-ranking typists and ended up in charge of international CIA branches, were asked about what it was like to be a woman working in the CIA in the 1960s and 70s. The riveting conversations were declassified by the CIA on October 30. Often facing rampant sexism and stigma, the officers proved invaluable to the agency. On one assignment, an embassy bomb plot was thwarted after an enemy operative divulged secrets to a female agent because she was 'just a woman who wasn't very bright'. CIA clerks and typists pictured in 1952. Recently declassified interviews with female operatives have revealed what it was like for women in the early years of the agency . One agent Meredith (last names are redacted in the lengthy interviews) describes how she joined the agency in 1979 because her husband was an ops officer. She began as a 'contract wife' - employed in low-paid secretarial work to support her husband's role. Meredith, who at the time she was interviewed was deputy chief of the CIA's European Division,  pointed out that having an eye for luxury clothing gave her an edge when trying to spot the foreign surveillants working undercover. She said: 'I always said if I ever wrote a book, I would start it with ''You could tell 'em by their socks''. You would always know surveillants [redacted word] at the time by the socks and shoes. 'We digress here, but with all the [redacted word] having such horrible clothes and horrible shoes and socks, the surveillants had good ones. 'That would never occur to my husband to look at it.' The foundation of spying: A 'make-up compact concealment device,' from the undated CIA archives . Another interviewee Patty described the role of wives in the 1970s as 'contract slaves' but agreed with Meredith that women were better at detecting other surveillants. She said it was especially easy to spot them when they tried to go shopping undercover as 'they just can't fake it' in stores. Dressed to kill: An evening outfit of a female CIA operative which had in-built surveillance equipment . Patty, who was awarded the CIA's Distinguished Career Intelligence Medal in 2004, said: 'I always put that down to women [being] . more sensitive [to] who's near or in their space, for physical . protection.' Another CIA agent Carla explained that one enemy operative revealed to her a plot to blow up an embassy simply because he underestimated her as a 'just a woman who wasn't very bright' while she was on assignment. Carla, who joined the CIA in 1965 and was Deputy Chief of the Africa Division when she retired eight years ago, said: 'I got credit for a recruitment but I never actually had to pitch the guy. 'Anyway I was sort of the ''Dumb Dora'' personality to survive, and ''Golly'' ''Gee!'' and ''Wow!'' 'And this [redacted word] that was it, he would seek me out. ''Oh, could we talk?'' He would tell me, ''I just love talking to you because you're not . very bright.'' 'And I would just sit like this [makes an innocent . expression], and I would get home and my spouse would say, ''Well how was it?'' ''Golly! Gee! You know? Wow!'' Carla continued: 'But it worked. And finally, unfortunately, the recruitment ended because he told me about a plot to bomb the embassy [redacted word] and we arrested him and his gang of merry men as they crossed the border. 'He just told me everything and I . got tons of intel out of him because I was just a woman who wasn't very . bright.' Women were initially hired in low-paid roles at the CIA to do secretarial work sometimes in support of their husbands who were agents . At times, female agents were often required to work undercover with gadgets straight out of a James Bond movie. Compact mirrors with pressed powder were adapted for surveillance and bugs implanted into glamorous evening gowns. The riveting interviews are part of a wealth of information recently declassified by the CIA as a collection entitled 'From Typist to Trailblazer: The Evolving View of Women in the CIA's Workforce.' With her string of pearls and cheerful grin, Eloise Page looks more like a church committee member than one of the CIA's most fearsome operatives. Miss Page (pictured above) began as a secretary during the Second World War at the Office of Strategic Services - the predecessor agency to CIA. She gained a wealth of counterintelligence expertise and at the end of WW2, was posted to Belgium in one of the first overseas CIA branches. She quickly proved to be a highly effective agent in the Clandestine Service. Miss Page rose through the ranks, eventually becoming the first female Chief of Station in the late 1970s - the highest foreign position. The Virginia native, a renowned expert on terrorist organizations, was known as 'the iron butterfly' by colleagues due to her character, 'a perfect southern lady with a core of steel', one remarked. She retired at the age of 67 in 1987 and passed away, aged 82, in 2002. On her death, then CIA director George Tenet said: 'From her earliest days of service with OSS, she was a source of inspiration to others. She will be forever.' The collection, most of which is being released for the first time, includes hundreds of studies, memos, letters and other official records documenting efforts to improve the status of women employees from 1947 to the present day. Part of the collection is documents from the 1953 'Petticoat Panel'. Despite women making up 40 per cent of CIA employees at the time (10 per cent higher than in the general U.S. workforce), only one-fifth of those women had even reached a mid-level salary grade - compared to 70 per cent of men. Family responsibilities and motherhood were seen as huge hindrances by CIA bosses at the time. Chief of Operations Richard Helms went as far as to say: 'You just get them to a point where they . are about to blossom out to a GS-12, and they get married, go somewhere . else, or something over which nobody has any control, and they are out . of the running.' Things had little improved by the 1970s, in particular in the Clandestine Service where, according to one memo, women were deemed 'limited in their operational potential'. Towards the end of the 1970s as women began to push through the glass ceiling in other industries, changes slowly crept in at the intelligence agency. In 1977, then-Deputy Director E. Henry . Knoche ordered a . gender-issues committee to address the lack of senior female employees. Today's CIA is a different world and popular culture is filled with no-nonsense images of female spies from Claire Danes as Carrie Mathison in TV show Homeland to Jessica Chastain's portrayal of 'Maya' - the female CIA agent credited with tracking down Osama bin Laden - in the movie Zero Dark Thirty. There is yet to be a female director of the CIA although things appear to be moving encouragingly in this direction. In 2011, 44 per cent of CIA employees at the top levels were women - up more than a third since 1980. In August, President Obama appointed Avril Haines as the CIA's deputy director - the first woman to ever hold that position. Yet limits still exist. Many women fall by the wayside due to the extreme demands of the job and its 'all or nothing' lifestyle. According to Mother Jones, the CIA analyst on whom Maya was based in Zero Dark Thirty was passed over for promotion last year.","Interviews with female CIA employees, who joined the lower ranks in the 1960s and 70s, reveal the sexism they endured .
