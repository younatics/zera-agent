"Sen. Rand Paul is proposing legislation aimed at eliminating criminal sentencing rules that adversely impact minorities, saying that ""we need some fresh ideas to combat old and festering problems."" The Republican from Kentucky described the measure Friday in a speech to the National Urban League. It's part of his aggressive outreach effort to African-Americans and other voting groups who don't traditionally back Republicans. Paul is trying to expand the GOP base and lay the groundwork for a potential 2016 campaign for the White House. His address highlighted sentencing reform, expanded voting rights, and education reform. It came one day after two other possible Republican presidential hopefuls, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, also touted similar reforms. Sentencing reform is one of Paul's signature issues. As he's done in previous speeches, he told the audience gathered in Cincinnati that the nation's criminal justice system is still stacked against minorities. ""Three out of four people in prison right now for non-violent crimes are black or brown. Our prisons are bursting with young men of color and our communities are full of broken families,"" Paul said. Rand Paul fights for felon voting rights . ""There is a cycle of poverty that often leads to drugs, to debt, and to prison. In prison, child support can accumulate into the thousands of dollars. Release from prison then finds that employers don't want to hire a convicted felon. ""With few options of real work, the cycle begins again. I say enough's enough. I won't sit idly by and watch our criminal justice system continue to consume, confine and define our young men. I say we take a stand and fight for justice now,"" Paul said. He then pointed out that the current legal distinctions between crack and powder cocaine have led to longer jail terms for the possession of crack. While he said that progress has been made in reducing those distinctions, Paul added that he was introducing legislation on Friday that ""eliminates any disparity between crack and powder cocaine."" Paul also touted that he's working with Democrats, like Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, on a bill that would expunge records, under certain circumstances, of non-violent and youth related crimes. And, he's rubbing shoulders with Attorney General Eric Holder on sentencing reform as well as some Republican governors. Rand Paul and his Democratic buds . Paul's other pitches . Paul also used his address in front of the National Urban League convention to make another pitch for expanding the voting rights of ex-cons. ""Nationwide, five million people are prevented from voting because of their criminal record. It's the biggest impediment to voting in our country. I want more people to vote, not less,"" Paul said. He described himself as ""a Republican who wants to restore a federal role for the government in the Voting Rights Act."" Paul twice quoted from Martin Luther King Jr. in his speech to the century-old civil rights organization. And Paul again mentioned King as he continued his crusade against the federal government's current surveillance activities. ""Dr. King's 'I Have a Dream' speech inspired the world but it also prompted the FBI to tap his phone illegally and spy on tens of thousands of Americans. Today, all Americans should be concerned that the government is collecting the records of Americans,"" he said. ""Frankly I think what Americans do on their cell phone is none of the government's damn business."" On education reform Paul attacked the status quo and proposed shifting the power away from government. ""Washington has no clue how to fix education. Washington doesn't know if whether you're a good teacher or a bad teacher. We should allow innovation to occur at the local level. I propose that we allow school charters, school choice, vouchers, competition. Competition breeds excellence,"" Paul said. And Paul also touted a plan to increase investment and job creation by moving control of some tax monies away from Washington and into state and local hands. ""I have a 10-year plan for areas of high unemployment and poverty, to lower taxes and promote employment,"" Paul said. Rand Paul: Will his star continue to rise? Christie and Ryan also make pitches . Some of Paul's language sounds similar to what Christie is saying. Thursday night, he and the chairman of the Republican Governor's Association once again said that there's far too many people sitting in prisons for non-violent drug crimes and called on Republicans to focus on people not just before they're born but after as well. ""I'm pro-life and if you're pro-life, you have to be pro-life when they get out of the womb also,"" Christie said in an appearance at the Aspen Institute in Colorado, repeating comments he made last month at a major social conservative gathering. Gov. Christie: 'You have to be pro-life when they get out of the womb' Christie said the justice system must stop stigmatizing the disease of drug addiction and focus more on rehabilitation. ""We don't give them any kind of significant treatment, long-range treatment, and then we release them. And then we wonder why they go back and commit more crimes to support their habit,"" Christie said. The potential 2016 presidential candidate also said giving drug addicts treatment instead of prison time would help the economy too. Earlier Thursday, Ryan, spelled out his plan to fight poverty, a pilot program that would combine 11 federal programs into one pool of money for participating states. Paul Ryan lays out new poverty plan . According to the plan, which the Wisconsin Republican detailed in a speech to the American Enterprise Institute, states would voluntarily submit their own anti-poverty proposals in order to get money. ""If everything passed muster, the federal government would give the green light,"" the House Budget Committee chairman said in a speech to the Washington-based think tank. ""And the state would get more flexibility. It would get to combine into one funding stream 11 different programs, things like food stamps, housing assistance, child care, and cash welfare."" The GOP, under the direction of Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, last year released a report that acknowledged the party's problem in reaching out to younger and minority voters, who overwhelming went for President Barack Obama and the Democrats in the 2012 election. The report included hundreds of recommendations for the party.","Rand Paul wants to alter criminal sentencing rules that adversely affect minorities .

"Allan Levene really -- really -- wants to serve in Congress. So much so, that he plans to run in four states: Georgia. Minnesota. Michigan. Hawaii. It's puzzling, but the Republican freely admits his strategy increases his odds of winning a House seat. As he sees it, all roads lead to Rome. ""No matter where you win a seat in Congress, you go to the same building. You do the same work,"" he said. ""You can work for your constituents, which all have similar needs, but the key is you go to Washington and help solve the country's problems."" Legally, his strategy is possible. But it likely will be a logistical nightmare. Running a congressional campaign as a political newcomer is tough enough. Multiply that by four and add a society that's quick to shun ""carpetbaggers"" -- people who move to a state to run for office -- and you get what some experts predict to be a waste of time and money. It appears Levene may be the first to try the unusual tactic. But what if he succeeds? Is he blazing a trail for a new campaign model? Jumping through the loophole . The Constitution lists only a few requirements for a House member:  Be at least 25, a U.S. citizen for at least seven years and a resident of the state when elected. But the Constitution says nothing about primaries or the nominating process, and that's the heart of Levene's strategy. The top 12 campaign questions of 2014 . Leaving out a rule that would prevent multi-state campaigns was an understandable omission by the Founding Fathers, Levene said. How could they have envisioned such an approach? ""Back then they couldn't fly from state to state,"" he said. In Levene's case, all four races are open, meaning there's no incumbent. Two districts â€” the ones in Georgia and Minnesota â€” are considered safe for Republicans, while the other two are considered safe for Democrats. The four states only require candidate residency at the time of the general election, not the primary. They also don't have laws prohibiting candidates from running in the primary if they're attempting to get on primary ballots in other states. The Federal Election Commission tracks the money side of federal campaigns. It told Levene his mission was legal as long he kept his fundraising separate in each state, meaning he couldn't raise money in Georgia and spend it in Minnesota. The FEC told CNN it hasn't issued specific guidance on that kind of campaign strategy. 'All politics is local' Levene, an avid blogger with some unorthodox ideas, has already created websites for each of his campaigns. But his true focus is on Georgia's 11th Congressional District, whose current representative, Republican Phil Gingrey, is running for the Senate. Of the four states, Georgia holds its primary first, on May 20. If Levene doesn't win the GOP nomination, he'll campaign in the other states. Minnesota, Michigan and Hawaii have nominating contests in August, just days apart from each other. Jordan Powell, a Republican political consultant based in Texas, said he's never heard of someone trying to run in multiple states and argued it's not a ""viable political strategy."" ""There's two problems: There's the practical day-to-day issues, like scheduling, fundraising, meetings, etc,"" Powell said. ""If you get past that, you still have a problem, to me, with voters about political opportunism."" CNN Poll: GOP has edge in early midterm indicator . A number of people, including Powell, brought up a common saying coined by former House Speaker Thomas ""Tip"" O'Neill: ""All politics is local."" ""It's very much true in Hawaii,"" said David Chang, chairman of Hawaii's Republican Party. ""People care what high school you went to, what nationality you are, what your last name is, how many generations your family has been in Hawaii, whether you know my auntie and uncle."" ""Being from the mainland and running for the office Hawaii, you have an uphill battle because of those dynamics,"" he added. Levene hasn't lived in Hawaii; he has only visited the state. But he says he still has a plan specific to the Aloha State. He wants to bring more IT jobs and companies from California and make the island known for being more than a tourist hub. ""It's clear that you need a noisy, loud congressional mouthpiece. I am noisy and I will put Hawaii on the map,"" he writes on his Hawaii website. Born in London, Levene, 64, first came to the United States when he was 21 and eventually became a naturalized citizen. He pursued a career in the IT industry and is now settled in Georgia, but he has lived in Michigan in the past, which is why he chose the Wolverine State as one of his ""four."" As for Minnesota, the 6th Congressional District has been a Republican stronghold for the past decade. Its current representative, Michele Bachmann, is retiring. Levene is attracted to races that would essentially guarantee him a general election victory if he wins the primary. ""The election process is about winning first and foremost,"" he said. But three well-known Republicans have already been vying for the seat for months. ""The runway for candidates who are serious about it literally started the day Congresswoman Bachmann announced her retirement,"" said Keith Downey, chairman of the Minnesota Republican Party. Downey had not heard of Levene's plan to run in the state, but found it difficult to see voters gravitating toward an outsider. ""I would imagine, like in most places, Minnesota voters are a little more comfortable voting for their own and having some past connection to a candidate,"" he said. Copycats in the future? Levene is surely hedging his bets. But what if his plan works? A source who worked to get Democrats elected to the House last decade seemed open to the idea. ""I wish we had known about that. Maybe we could have gotten even more Democrats elected,"" the source said, somewhat jokingly. The source, who asked not to be identified, added the tactic could come in handy for candidates running in districts along state borders. 7 keys to the 2014 midterms . Others had a hard time imagining the strategy becoming one for the textbooks. Powell said ""some of the practical decisions would be easier"" in such a scenario, but the candidate would still have a ""messaging problem."" ""You're still looking like you just desperately want to be in Congress, regardless of the district or the issue,"" he said. Such an image doesn't pass ""the smell test"" with voters, he added. Another House campaign strategist, who asked not to be identified in order to speak more freely, had also never heard of the multi-state approach but said ""it's something that a credible strategist would never recommend for any candidate."" ""You're opening yourself up to several attacks,"" the source said. 'Just ideas' Levene realizes he will run into criticism and said he's prepared to take on his opponents. ""I'm not carpet bagging in the sense that I want to take advantage of the district that I'm running for,"" he said. ""I will work very hard for whichever district that I'm elected to."" For Levene, he believes he must get elected to carry out his ideasâ€”which include carving out a back-up territory for Israel inside of Texas, and creating a pathway for thousands of Chinese nannies to come to the U.S. and teach children how to speak Mandarin. ""Having ideas without going to Washington means they're just ideas,"" he said in his Americanized British accent. ""No one will pay the slightest bit of attention."" He also wants to eliminate corporate income taxes. To combat ""career politicians,"" he wants to void pensions for members if they don't leave office after four terms in the House or two terms in the Senate. Part of his rush to get elected stems from his expectation to live for only one more decade, a prediction based on family history. He's also convinced the U.S. currency will collapse by 2020. ""My job is to stop that from happening."" If he doesn't win any of the races, he and his wife plan to liquidate all their real estate and other assets, buy Swiss francs and simply wait until the economy gets better. ""If what I want to do does not resonate with the public, then the public will choose somebody else,"" he said. ""And that's OK.""","Allan Levene wants to run for Congress in Georgia, Minnesota, Michigan and Hawaii .

"You can find the ideological divide in Venezuela at almost any gas station.  A Hummer rolls in and fills up for just $2 and its owner gives a thumbs-up. Hugo Chavez's gas subsidies have given this country the cheapest gas prices in the world. But just after him, a middle class, middle-aged father rolls in for a fill up and tells us, ""It's disgusting; it can't go on like this,"" referring to the $12 billion Chavez's government pays annually to subsidize gas in Venezuela. Few men or policies have so divided a country, a continent, a hemisphere,  but President Hugo Chavez and his so-called ""Chavismo"" revolution is contentious whether at the gas station or the United Nations. How he fares in Venezuela's elections on Sunday will underscore his legacy as either a self-styled Latin American Robin Hood or a shrewd autocrat using and abusing his country's oil riches to stay in power. And the world is watching. ""We've reached the point where the current situation cannot continue,"" said economist David Rees with Capital Market in London. Chavez, Capriles enter home stretch in Venezuelan presidential race . Oil is everything to Venezuela, accounting for more than 95% of its exports. And yet oil production has slowed for almost a decade. Add to that a rising inflation rate, crumbling infrastructure, energy shortages everywhere outside the capital, Caracas, and private sector and foreign investment growth remain low. ""The continuation of the current policy framework could culminate in a crisis, a balance of payments crisis, perhaps a default. Whereas Venezuela does have great potential, it has the biggest proven oil reserves in the world and investment has been lagging behind and there is plenty of room for development,"" Rees said. ""So investors are obviously sitting, waiting for signs, and Venezuela could be a much better bet than it has been."" Chavez has overseen a radical rethink of the economy in Venezuela. By nationalizing many industries, especially energy, his government claims to be fashioning a socialist revolution where the poor are given housing, education and medicine free from the state. And despite the economy's challenges, many leaders in Latin America compliment and indeed may wish to emulate Chavez's policies, especially nationalization. Leaders in Brazil and Argentina have even praised Chavez for standing up to ""imperialism,"" a not-so-veiled reference to U.S. influence and power in Latin and South America. For his part, President Barack Obama has insisted that he does not see a ""national security impact"" on the United States from Chavez's policies. But Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio has characterized the Chavez government as a menace in the region and President Obama as naive for not recognizing it. ""Hugo Chavez is not only a threat to the Venezuelan people's freedom and democratic aspirations, he has also supported Iran's regime in its attempts to expand its intelligence network throughout the hemisphere, facilitated money laundering activities that finance state sponsors of terrorism and provided a safe haven for FARC narco-terrorists, among many other actions,"" Rubio said in a statement released this summer. Venezuela: A model for Latin America? On Wednesday Rubio told CNN it's essential the Venezuelan election proceed as free and fair. ""I will say that we as believers in democracy, and not just those of us in the United States, but all the democracies in the region need to insist on is that the election results are respected, that the election results are fair, that there is no undermining of the election, that there is no intimidation of voters. On that we should be very clear and very firm, and then the results are up to the people of Venezuela, and we wish them well,"" he said. Indeed, Chavez's vocal support for the Syrian regime and his close relationship with Iran will only grow stronger and bolder if he is re-elected for a six-year term. While his challenger, Henrique Capriles, says his foreign policy priorities will be much different, his win could destabilize what is already a fractious society and an unreliable military leadership. Capriles told CNN he doesn't believe there will be any destabilization inside Venezuela if he wins, and he challenges the notion that only Chavez can speak for the poor. ""This is a big lie. It is unfortunate that many times, some people have this perception that in Venezuela, the poor are with the government and those who are not poor are not with the government. It is a great misconception, a falsehood,"" Capriles said in May. The effects of this election may well be felt at the gas station first, and not just those in Venezuela. The country is an OPEC member and is still a significant supplier of oil to the United States. As economists have already warned, an oil price shock triggered by Venezuelan unrest is unlikely, but still a possibility.

"(CNN)When Americans ponder the world's most desolate places, they tend to conjure Antarctic outposts, Tibetan mountaintops, central Australian plateaus or Kardashian brain stems. Fact is, if you're in the States you don't have to travel halfway across the globe to separate yourself from civilization. You don't even have to leave the continental United States. Secluded swamps, forsaken tundra, vacuous canyons, yonder mountain ranges, deserted deserts -- despite all the development, the United States is still home to plenty of untamed hinterland. Here's the ultimate list of those destinations with suggested activities for each. The criteria are as simple as they are vague: maximum distance from other humans and any signs of their existence, including but not limited to roads, posted signs, smokestacks, government surveillance, electronic dance music, Snapchat and cronuts. (And, as is so often the case, Alaska and Hawaii not included.*) Camping . Rampart Mountain (Montana) In 2008, Backpacker magazine identified the most remote coordinates in the lower 48 United States: Yellowstone National Park's Two Ocean Plateau. But there's more to seclusion than geography -- chiefly, the absence not only of civilization, but civilians as well, and Yellowstone hosted 3.19 million of them last year. According to an ecologist couple dedicated to identifying the most remote spot in each U.S. state, that location is smack in the middle of Montana's Bob Marshall Wilderness Complex. It took the couple five days hiking in, during which they encountered grizzly bears and mountain goats, traversed white limestone and red sandstone streams and crossed the Great Divide en route to maximum peoplelessness. Bob Marshall Wilderness Complex, 10 Hungry Horse Drive, Hungry Horse, Montana; +1 406 387 3800 . Hiking . High Peaks Wilderness (New York) Admittedly, there are hikes in the United States more secluded than this section of Adirondack Park. Most of us without 10 days to throw at a nature walk, however, will find plenty of peace in the largest publicly protected area on the U.S. mainland. The terrain varies from low-lying swamplands to the highest point in New York state, the summit of Mount Marcy (5,344 feet). With its most isolated spot reaching nearly six miles from the nearest road, the High Peaks Wilderness Area still attract thousands of hikers a year. But there are plenty of unmarked trails, high-elevation lakes and untrammeled terrain -- especially in the Peaks' western zone -- on which to avoid them. High Peaks Wilderness Area, Eastern Adirondacks/Lake Champlain, New York; +1 518 897 1200 . Sun-tanning . Wildcat Beach (California) The 5.5-mile hike (or seven-mile bike ride) keeps the average beach-goer from reaching this vehicularly inaccessible notch of the popular Point Reyes National Seashore. But the lush vegetation, unrivaled Pacific views and downright alien beachside waterfall (aka, Alamere Falls) keep rewarding those who do. The falls are active year round, but peak in activity following the rainy season, from January to March. Strong currents make the ocean more of an aesthetic rather than recreational feature of the beach, but once the morning fog of the summer months burns off, Wildcat's 2.5 miles of expansive sands and encompassing cliff-side ramparts make for a sunny yet secluded beach adventure. Beaches of Point Reyes, Bear Valley Visitor Center, 1 Bear Valley Road, Point Reyes Station, California; +1 415 464 5100 . Game tracking . Wasatch Mountains (Utah) Outdoor Life calls it possibly the toughest hunt in North America. The goat are as abundant in Utah's high alpine areas as the treacherous peaks and cliff faces, making the Wasatch Mountains a destination of maximum risk and reward offering minimum human competition. According to Double C Guides & Outfitters, the Box Elder and Provo peaks see the fewest interlopers, owing to the difficulty of the terrain, which is rife with mountain goat. Other areas of the Wasatch Mountains support healthy deer, elk and moose -- but also hiker -- populations. While the altitudes are high and physical demands strenuous, if you're a hunter, the greatest challenge may be drawing a big game tag in the state's annual raffle. Wasatch Mountain State Park, Midway, Utah; +1 435 654 1791 . Canoeing . Wilderness Waterway (Florida) The nation's most famous paddleways are Minnesota's Boundary Waters -- explaining their absence here. Less frequented, especially come summer, is the labyrinth of mangrove forests, Gulf beaches and sawgrass marshes comprising Everglades National Park. Wilderness Waterway is the 99-mile corridor from Everglades City down to Flamingo, flanked by plenty of alternate routes that promise one of the most humanly deserted, biologically diverse wilds in the world; more than 360 species of bird, endangered panthers and the only known coexistence of alligators and crocodiles on earth. Mainland Florida's most remote spot can also be found within the 'Glades, 17 miles from the nearest road -- just one mile closer than Montana's farthest reach. Everglades National Park, main entrance at 40001 State Road, Homestead, Florida; +1 305 242 7700 . Waterfalls . Mooney Falls (Supai, Arizona) Deep within the Grand Canyon's western edge, this Havasupai tribal village is the most remote community in the continental United States, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Mail here is still delivered via mule and, aside from helicopter, that's the only transportation in or out. The 2,000-foot descent down Havasu Canyon Trail into Supai starts at Hualapai Hilltop. Eight miles later you'll find a general store, a Mormon church and the Supai Village Cafe, where fried bread is a staple. From there, Mooney Falls is just downstream. It's a nearly 200-feet tumble of incandescent blue-green waters for which the Havasupai are named. Contact the Havasupai Tribe for information and entry permits. Fishing . Angle Inlet (Minnesota) The highest point of latitude on the U.S. mainland is so remote the only way to reach it by land is through Canada. In fact, being the product of a surveying error in the Treaty of Paris, the Northwest Angle should by all rights be Canadian. Instead, it's one of few U.S. points of entry to the Lake of the Woods, a 1,700-square-mile freshwater Eden with a world-class walleye population in addition to pike, perch, muskie, bass, trout, sturgeon, crappie and sauger. Following a secessionist stunt in the late-1990s intended to raise awareness of neighboring Ontario's restrictive catch limits, visitors to the Angle are now able to keep their often trophy-size catches. Angle Inlet, Angle Township, Woods County, Minnesota . Driving . U.S. Route 50 (Nevada) What was once a warning to tourists became the slogan for a tourism board. A 1986 Life magazine article dubbed the Nevada stretch of this coast-to-coast highway ""The Loneliest Road in America."" An accompanying caveat from the American Automobile Association urged drivers to avoid U.S. 50 unless they were ""confident of their survival skills."" The state has since seized on the reputation of its lonesome road, extolling the virtues of its vacuity and points of interest, including bygone mining camps, ghost towns and nuclear test sites. The highway mimics the old Pony Express route, traversing sand dunes and snowy mountains as well as Great Basin National Park near its eastern terminus. The Loneliest Road in America, U.S. Route 50, Nevada . Russia Watching . Little Diomede Island (Alaska) *Despite that disclaimer above excluding the 49th state, we can't help making one exception to this list because, if we're being honest, just about the most remote everything in the United States is located in Alaska. It has the most land and lowest population density of any state, while offering some of the richest natural spoils on earth. But the tiny island of Little Diomede poses not only one of the most effective escapes from humanity, it also offers the kind of front-row vistas on Russia that once formed the putative centerpiece of Sarah Palin's foreign policy. In the middle of the 50-mile expanse separating the United States and its renewed rival is a population of approximately 40 people for whom it's a hardscrabble life -- but the views of Siberia are superb.

"In 1990, a 25-year-old researcher for Amnesty International, stuck on a train stopped on the tracks between London and Manchester, stared out the window for hours. To those around her, no doubt rustling newspapers and magazines, busily rifling through work, the young woman no doubt appeared to be little more than a space cadet, wasting her time, zoning out. But that woman came to be known as JK Rowling. And in those idle hours daydreaming out the train window, she has said that the entire plot of the magical Harry Potter series simply ""fell into"" her head. Mark Twain, during an enormously productive summer of writing in 1874, spent entire days daydreaming in the shade of Quarry Farm in New York, letting his mind wander, thinking about everything and nothing at all, and, in the end, publishing ""The Adventures of Tom Sawyer."" Such creative breakthroughs in leisurely moments are hardly unique to literature. Physicist Richard Feynman idly watched students in the cafeteria goof off by spinning plates. For the fun of it, he began to make calculations of the wobbles. That ""piddling around,"" as he called it, led to developing the Feynman diagrams to explain quantum electrodynamics, which resulted in a Nobel Prize. Legend has it not only that Archimedes had his ""eureka!"" moment about water displacement while relaxing in the tub, but that Einstein worked out the Theory of Relativity while tootling around on his bicycle. Though Protestant work ethic-driven Americans have tended to worry about the devil holding sway in idle time, it turns out idle time is crucial for creativity, innovation and breakthrough thinking. And now we know why. Neuroscience is finding that when we are idle, our brains are most active. It all has to do with something called the brain's default mode network, explains Andrew Smart, a human factors research scientist and author of the new book, ""Autopilot, the Art & Science of Doing Nothing."" The default mode network is like a series of airport hubs in different and typically unconnected parts of the brain. And that's why it's so crucial. When the brain flips into idle mode, this network subconsciously puts together stray thoughts, makes seemingly random connections and enables us to see an old problem in an entirely new light. Using brain scans, psychologists John Kounios and Mark Beeman have found that just before that moment of insight, the brain turns inward, what they call a ""brain blink,"" and lights up an area believed to be linked to our ability to understand the poetry of metaphors. A positive mood and taking time to relax, they found, were critical precursors to these a-ha! moments. That's not to say that being idle all the time is the answer. Sir Isaac Newton was steeped in the study of physical science when he sat in his garden in a ""contemplative mood,"" idly sipping tea after dinner one evening, noticed an apple fall straight to the ground, and came up with the Law of Gravity. ""To be most creative, you need this oscillation between deep study with focused attention and daydreaming, which is why you may have your great ideas when you're in the shower,"" Smart told me. ""They can come into your consciousness when you're not busy."" Smart himself typically takes long, leisurely walks during the workday and carries a notebook with him to capture any interesting thoughts or ideas that his default mode network may burble to the surface. Most employers frown on such behavior. But if they're smart, they wouldn't. One recent study of the pharmaceutical industry by Bernard Munos of the InnoThink Center for Research in Biomedical Innovation and William Chin, former dean of research at Harvard Medical School, for example, found that, despite massive research and development budgets, the number of potential breakthrough drugs introduced in the past decade has dropped roughly in half. Why? Because companies became obsessed with cautious efficiency, they argue, rather than in often risky, dreamy innovation. ""Companies pressure workers to be in the office, to work all the time. But at the same time, they're really interested in innovation, which comes from letting go,"" Smart said. ""But you can't have it both ways."" Just think. The Wright Brothers closed up their busy bicycle shop in Ohio, decamped to the beach in North Carolina and in this playful, leisure time, invented the airplane. Bill Gates escapes to a cabin in the woods for ""think weeks."" Google, Facebook and LinkedIn give employees some version of ""20 percent time"" -- affectionately known as ""employee goof off time."" And giving workers time to daydream, experiment and follow a passion without worrying about failure has resulted in some of their most innovative and successful products, such as Gmail and AdSense, an advertising program that Wired reports now produces about a quarter of Google's revenue . Hard as it is to believe in our modern, work-worshipping culture, idleness, leisure time, daydreaming and time away from the hurly-burly, the drudgery of routine and the endless nose to the grindstone, is not only essential for innovation, it is, in fact, what has created civilization. Art, literature, inventions, innovation, philosophy -- one could argue nearly all that is transcendent about our flawed human species -- has come as a result of a delicate balance between the uninterrupted time in leisure to daydream, to set the default mode network free, and the concentrated time at work to make those flights of whim and fancy something real. Philosopher Bertrand Russell, in his famous 1932 essay, ""In Praise of Idleness,"" advocated a four-hour workday and more leisure time for all. Daydreaming, imaging the possibility of a better world in leisure time, he argued, not only cultivated arts, science and culture, but liberated the oppressed and birthed new, democratic systems of governance. Without leisure, he wrote, ""mankind would never have emerged from barbarism."" It's a crucial truth that is increasingly getting lost as our work hours climb. Workers in the U.S. put in among the most extreme hours of any advanced economy on the planet -- as economic uncertainty and fear of the future keep us firmly planted at our desks, the better to show the boss what good workers we are in advance of the next round of downsizing. Our antiquated laws give no overwork protection to knowledge workers, and as advances in technology, as much as they are designed to free us, keep us instead tethered to the office, checking texts and e-mails, returning work calls everywhere and all the time, leaving us feeling perpetually ""on call"" and never quite able to get away from it all. Work, and this insidious work creep says leisure scholar Ben Hunnicutt, is now how Americans tend to answer the existential questions of who we are and how we find meaning in life. And in so doing, we have created a world that has no time for something as seemingly silly and unproductive as daydreaming and leisure time. And that's where we're wrong. Just imagine, what if, instead of staring out the window, that Amnesty International researcher stuck on a train dove into a thick ream of cases to catch up on? Or, if it were today, whipped out her smartphone and tackled the backlog of e-mails in her inbox, diverting herself occasionally with a game of Candy Crush?

"(CNN)There's big. And then there's bigger. Introducing Triple Deuce, set to be the world's biggest superyacht at a whopping 222 meters (728 feet) long. At $1 billion, it will also be the most expensive private yacht ever built, costing more than the annual GDP of Western Sahara, the British Virgin Islands, and Micronesia. The identity of Triple Deuce's owner remains secret. Nonetheless, building a yacht of this size is all about ""boasting rights,"" said Craig Timm of 4Yacht, broker of the record-breaking project. ""It's just like the competition to build the world's tallest building,"" he said of the commission, due to be completed in spring 2018. ""Project Deuce will cost $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion,"" added Timm. ""And don't forget to add in annual operating costs -- on a yacht of this size, it will run the owner up an additional $20 to $30 million per year."" The boat will be more than 131 feet (40 meters) longer than the world's current biggest superyacht, ""Azzam,"" believed to be owned by the President of the United Arab Emirates, Sheikh  Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan. It will also trump Russian businessman Roman Abramovich's ""Eclipse"" by 192 feet (58.5 meters). ""Our client was concerned that if we built the yacht to 200 meters (656 feet), then someone would come along like Roman Abramovich when he built Eclipse at 163.5 meters (536 feet), and outdid Sheikh Maktoum's yacht, the 162-meter (531-foot) Dubai, by only 1.5 meters (5 feet),"" explained Timm. ""By building the yacht to 222 meters (728 feet), the owner wants to make it difficult, if not impossible, to be 'eclipsed' himself."" As the race to build the world's biggest superyacht steps up a notch, is there a point when these floating palaces simply become ""too big?"" ""You can't really be 'too big' for the high seas. But these superyachts are now at such a size that many of them can't get into harbors,"" said John Kampfner, author of ""The Rich: From slaves to superyachts, a 2,000 year history."" ""So what they do is moor out at sea, and a small boat -- which is still enormous by the standards of ordinary mortals -- will take them to shore. Or they could always jump on their helicopter, because no self-respecting superyacht comes without a helipad these days."" In the past two decades average superyacht sizes have more than doubled, according to Gaelle Tallarida, managing director of the Monaco Yacht Show. ""Fifteen years ago a large yacht was 45 meters (147 feet),"" she said. ""Whereas now it's 100 meters (328 feet) long, maybe even a little more,"" she said. ""And I think we have still not achieved the limit."" Triple Deuce's master suite alone encompasses two stories and stretches across 275 square meters (275 square feet) -- including a private gym. The seven-deck superyacht also comes with two pools, numerous jacuzzi, and a hair stylist and barber. Yet in a global climate of ""haves and have-nots,"" is it morally justifiable to spend $1 billion on a private yacht catering for 36 guests? ""To be honest, what ordinary mortals think is 'moral,' is not actually relevant to these people,"" said Kampfner. ""You have to understand that we're not talking about the top 1% -- in this instance we're talking about the 0.01%. This is a tiny group who live in their own bubble, they mix only among themselves."" Timm sees things differently, pointing to the employment opportunities created during the building and running of the superyacht. ""The boat will take approximately two to three million human hours to build -- not counting all the worldwide subcontractor hours, or the ready-made items already available on the market ready to be installed on the yacht,"" he said. ""Building the yacht at the shipyard will directly employ, at the minimum, 500 people for a period of three years. These people, who have families to support and feed, will be gainfully employed. ""And this does not include the 50 to 70 people who will work on the yacht and will be employed full time by the yacht owner, as well as others who supply the yacht."" He extends this reasoning to the media -- ""You, the journalist, benefits from this build indirectly by being gainfully employed by CNN for writing this story."" And you, the person reading this story? Kampfer sees the public's interest in the lifestyles of the super rich as a type of luxury porn. ""There is an enormous sense of injustice which is shared not just by the poor, but also by the middle class, towards the global super rich,"" he said. ""But together with that however, is a sense of envy and ogling. So whether you call it confusion, or double standards, or hypocrisy, or whatever it might be -- we both abhor the lifestyles of the super rich and at the same time we are endlessly fascinated by them.""

"Washington (CNN)Sen. Rand Paul resumes the campaign trail Wednesday, returning to the first-in-the-nation primary state of New Hampshire for a full day of events. It's his first time to the Granite State since he made a two-day swing in October to campaign for Scott Brown, and his fifth visit to the state in the past year. But this time there's no hiding under the guise of a 2014 surrogate. The Kentucky Republican, who's likely running for president, is roaring to get started as Mitt Romney, Jeb Bush and Chris Christie also make big pre-campaign moves. Look no further than the blunt criticism Paul offered of his potential rivals on the eve of his New Hampshire trip. In an interview with Politico, Paul knocked Bush as a ""Big Government Republican"" and argued that Romney already ""had his chance."" RELATED: Jeb Bush heads to California fundraisers, some hosted by former Romney donors . In a separate interview with the conservative outlet The Daily Signal, Paul further pounced on Romney for considering a third presidential run, saying the former Massachusetts governor failed to ""attract a big enough constituency to win"" and that ""it's time for some fresh blood."" It was only a few days ago that his top political adviser, Doug Stafford, reacted to the Romney news by telling reporters: ""As Senator Paul has said previously, the more the merrier."" Guess not. In New Hampshire Wednesday, Paul started by meeting with local elected officials for breakfast in Manchester at Murphy's Diner, a local hot spot known for its Captain Crunch French Toast. Later in the day he attends what's billed as a ""Second Amendment Supporter Event"" at the Londonderry Fish & Game Club, before touring the Founders Academy, a public charter school in Manchester. Also among his six public and private events is a session on Common Core, where Paul will likely draw a sharp contrast between himself and Bush, who's a staunch supporter of the controversial education standards. RELATED: What's happening in 2016: Romney and everyone else . On the same day it was reported that Christie is gearing up to launch a political action committee, Paul's adviser, Stafford, confirmed Tuesday that Paul hired Chip Englander as the campaign manager for his likely presidential campaign. Englander, 33, ran Republican Bruce Rauner's impressive gubernatorial win last year in Illinois, stealing the office away from Democratic hands. The Washington Post first reported Englander's hire. It was the latest staff move by Team Rand, which also recently hired Republican strategist Chris LaCivita, who helped embattled Sen. Pat Roberts hold onto his seat in Kansas last year, as a senior adviser. LaCivita is slated to run Paul's campaign in South Carolina, which typically holds the first primary in the South. Paul is bypassing the congressional GOP retreat in Pennsylvania on Thursday to fly out West and meet with business leaders and activists in Phoenix behind closed doors. On Friday and Saturday, he continues holding meetings and events, this time in Nevada, a state that traditionally holds the first nominating contest in the West. His father, former Rep. Ron Paul, had a solid block of support in Nevada as a presidential candidate in 2012. While Romney overwhelmingly won the caucuses, Paul took a majority of the state's delegates. Rand Paul will make a public appearance at the Peppermill Restaurant in Vegas on Friday and talk to reporters in Reno the next day. RELATED: Christie supporters to form leadership PAC .","Sen.

"(CNN) -- Edward Dolman is Christie's first chief executive officer to have been a specialist, who understands the pressure and the nature of valuing art. Part of his mission is attracting other highly motivated specialists into their business. A Christie's employee stands beside a painting  at Christie's auction house in London on July 4. Dolman was born in London in 1960 and attended Dulwich College from 1971-1978, before studying History of Art at Southampton University. He later completed a degree at the Study Centre for Fine and Decorative Arts, which had a close relationship with the Victoria and Albert Museum. Not being of blue-blood birth, he joined Christie's because of the link with Christie's South Kensington, starting out as a porter in the furniture department. After a year he assumed the role of specialist in the furniture department of South Kensington, where he would see everything from European to Chinese furniture in the high-volume saleroom over the next 10 years. Meanwhile he became an auctioneer, doing a number of off-site sales at country estates and traveling to France and Belgium to generate business in the middle market of furniture. At that time he was on the Management Committee, and South Kensington began to do great sales. Finally in 1995, he decided he wanted to become a manager and took a course at the Institute of Directors in the Mall to learn the language of business and the motivation of people. Dolman was subsequently made Managing Director of Christie's Amsterdam, applying new techniques and marketing to enhance interest in high-quality art. Twenty months later he returned to Christie's London on King Street as the Commercial Director to run Christie's Europe. As he attempted to develop new categories to win business, he was made Managing Director. In 1999 Dolman moved to New York as the International Managing Director and later as Chief Executive. Together with Christie's International Management Group, they developed an intensive five-year business plan, and Dolman took over from Christopher Davidge, as approved by Francois Pinault.","Dolman was specialist in furniture department of South Kensington for 10 years .

"GAZA-ISRAEL BORDER (CNN) -- From a distance, smoke rises over Gaza. It is about as close as most reporters can get to the battle zone. The world's media have been camped on the Israeli border with Gaza. Israel's media restrictions have prevented dozens of international journalists from entering Gaza, where the Jewish state is waging an operation against militant targets. International news media are forced to report on the more than two-week-old conflict from a hill near the Gaza-Israel border. CNN relies on a local journalist in Gaza, but cannot send other reporters into the Palestinian territory. In addition, Egypt is also not allowing journalists to cross its border into Gaza. ""It's really frustrating, you can't be there, see there and feel it,"" said CNN's Nic Robertson. ""And you see these pictures from the hospital, but what's happening behind the hospital? What's Hamas doing?"" Israel has accused Hamas militants of exploiting the deaths of civilians to garner international sympathy through the media. Robertson pointed out that allowing reporters into Gaza would give the world a more thorough picture of Israel's military operation. ""The questions we would ask that go beyond the immediacy of the civilian casualties that you want to know about, but the other stuff that really informs you,"" he said. It is a very different strategy from Israel's position during its 2006 war against Hezbollah militants in Lebanon. Then, reporters were allowed to broadcast from Israeli artillery positions. But this time, Israel has changed its tactics and is preventing international reporters from being embedded with the military to avoid interference in military operations, an Israeli government spokesman said. ""There was too much exposure,"" Daniel Seaman said. ""It had an effect on our ability to achieve strategic goals, so that's one of the lessons we learned from the war in Lebanon."" Some Israeli journalists are embedded with the military in Gaza but are not allowed to report from elsewhere. The Tel Aviv-based Foreign Press Association -- of which CNN is a member -- is among several groups that have criticized the restrictions. ""The unprecedented denial of access to Gaza for the world's media amounts to a severe violation of press freedom and puts the state of Israel in the company of a handful of regimes around the world which regularly keep journalists from doing their jobs,"" the association said in a January 6 statement. John Ging, the head of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in Gaza, said the absence of journalists is preventing the truth from getting out. Herve Deguine, a spokesman for the Paris, France-based Reporters Without Borders, said the dangers of the current conflict do not override the need for media coverage. ""Of course it's a dangerous place, of course journalists have to take the responsibilities and have to decide whether they want to go in or not and where they want to be,"" Deguine said. ""But banning the press to enter Gaza is just unacceptable."" Almost two weeks into the operation, Israel did allow a western camera crew across the border. But footage shot by the BBC crew was subject to clearance by Israeli military censors. Images from inside Gaza did filter out to the world from journalists based inside Gaza who work for news agencies such as Ramattan and broadcasters like Al-Jazeera. Inside Gaza, Hamas has controlled the images broadcast by the media, and pictures of suffering have been encouraged. But the outside world has seen very few images of Hamas fighters or their rockets being fired into Israel. Both the Israeli military and Hamas have launched pages on the Web site, YouTube. Israel Defense Forces says the shared video is ""documentation of the IDF's humane action and operational success in Operation Cast Lead."" Hamas' video shows graphic scenes from the fighting and also attacks its political rival, Fatah. In times of war, the line between winning and losing can come down to the public relations battle as much as the military offensive itself. But for journalists, it's about finding a balance in the story -- a difficult task when they are unable to cover all the angles.","Israel's media restrictions have prevented journalists from entering Gaza .

From the leader of the free world to celebs, it appeared that Valentine's Day weekend was for lovers of season two of the hit Netflix series. The show, about the devious machinations of Washington politician Francis Underwood and his wife, Claire, played by Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright, has a devoted fan base that eagerly awaited the release of the new season on Friday -- and many of them watched all 13 episodes over the weekend. President Barack Obama is so into the show that he tweeted right before the release, ""No spoilers, please."" Don't worry Mr. President, Netflix has you covered. They offered up the Spoiler Foiler, which blocks any danger words in Twitter timelines that might reveal too much. Trust us, such a thing is needed from the first episode on (no spoilers here, we promise). Celeb fans couldn't resist getting in on the binge. ""Teen Wolf"" star Melissa Ponzio tweeted about a new addition to the show with ""can i tell you how much i love Cashew?! shes gonna make everyone pay!! @HouseofCards omg #HouseOfCards.""

"(CNN) -- Our favorite Sunday of the year will arrive on February 2, and we're already armed with snacks and snark to dissect the best part of Super Bowl XLVIII: its commercials. There will be the usual deluge of movie trailers -- expect to see clips for Darren Aronofsky's ""Noah"" movie as well as Kevin Costner's ""Draft Day"" -- plus the ad spots shilling beer, M&Ms and everything else. Here are seven clips that we're looking forward to watching all over again: . Budweiser's puppy love . C'mon people. This has small furry creatures, adoption and interspecies bonding. We've long awaited the moment when the Super Bowl gives up on football and just makes the Puppy Bowl the main event, and we consider this Budweiser commercial to be the first step toward that glorious day. The Muppets steal a car . The Muppets are mostly around for fun, but they often sneak in a lesson or two while they're at it. With their Super Bowl commercial, they impart a very useful one: do not, under any circumstances, pull over for a Muppets bus -- unless you want them to hijack your car. (On the other hand, if your car is hijacked by Muppets, at least you'll get a groovy song out of it.) Anna Kendrick's 'non-Super Bowl' Super Bowl commercial . We love this Newcastle Brown Ale ad for so many reasons, but we're only going to give you our top three: 1) It stars Anna Kendrick. 2) It stars Anna Kendrick basically giving the ""am I beer commercial hot?"" monologue we give ourselves every morning. 3) It stars Anna Kendrick giving the only appropriate response to that: ""I mean I'm hot ... But like ... beer commercial hot? No. But I love a challenge."" The 'Full House' reunion . We haven't seen Bob Saget, Dave Coulier and John Stamos -- aka ""Full House's"" Danny Tanner, Uncle Joey and Uncle Jesse -- together like this since ""Full House"" went off the air almost 19 years ago, so excuse us while we're going to soak up as much of this minireunion as possible. If we're lucky, maybe Saget and Coulier will join Stamos in his Dannon Oikos spokesman duties full-time. 'Draft day' trailer . If the marketing team behind Kevin Costner's upcoming dramedy ""Draft Day"" didn't find a way to advertise during the Super Bowl, we'd question their devotion to the job. The film, directed by Ivan Reitman and also starring Jennifer Garner and Ellen Burstyn, features Costner as the general manager of the Cleveland Browns as he grapples with the responsibility of having the No. 1 draft pick. We're getting shades of ""Jerry Maguire"" from this movie, and we like it. 'Noah' trailer . Admittedly, the promotion for ""Noah"" is a bit of a downer (#TheFloodIsComing? That's a great thought to have during the Super Bowl), but we can't help but be excited to see what Darren Aronofsky's going to do with this classic Biblical story. Stars include Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connelly and Emma Watson. The film will arrive in theaters on March 28. Ellen's Beats Music commercial, with bears . Ellen DeGeneres is a self-described fan of the new Beats Music app, and she shot a Super Bowl ad to show just how much she loves it. Playing what appears to be a modern-day Goldilocks who likes to hang out at a place called The Woods (we think we've been there ...), DeGeneres grooves to pop music with some hipster bears. Which commercials are you looking forward to watching on Sunday? Are you a Super Bowl ad expert?","Part of the fun of the Super Bowl is watching the ads .

"Beijing (CNN)Legislators in China's far-western Xinjiang province have passed a law to prohibit residents from wearing burqas in public, state media reported, in a  continued campaign against what authorities view as religious extremism. The new ban in Urumqi was approved by local legislators last month, and given the greenlight by the regional legislature at the weekend. The ordinance name suggests it targets outer garments covering someone's full body including the face, which is called a burqa in some Islamic traditions. A spate of recent violent incidents has rocked Xinjiang, a resource-rich region long inhabited by the Turkic-speaking, largely Muslim Uyghurs. The arrival of waves of Han Chinese, the country's predominant ethnic group, over the past decades has fueled ethnic tensions. Chinese officials have blamed the recent attacks on Uyghur separatists -- whom they also label ""religious extremists"" -- seeking to establish an independent state. Last August, another city in Xinjiang banned people wearing Islamic-style clothing and large beards from riding public buses during a provincial sporting event, according to state media. News reports at the time said Karamay city authorities targeted veils, large beards, as well as three types of Islamic dresses -- including those with the star and crescent symbol. Dozens of bus stations in the city were said to be manned by security personnel to conduct checks and report violators to the police. While the measures in Karamay didn't openly single out Uyghurs, exiled Uyghur rights groups have condemned them, calling the ban a ""green light"" for racism and discrimination. Those restrictions came shortly after after authorities in Xinjiang banned students and civil servants from fasting during Ramadan, the Muslim holy month. Amnesty International has said Uyghurs face widespread discrimination in employment, housing and educational opportunities, as well as curtailed religious freedom and political marginalization. Other critics, including exiled Uyghur activists, have attributed the rise of violence in Xinjiang to Beijing's increasingly repressive rule there -- a claim the government vehemently denies.

"(CNN) -- Recessionistas, rejoice: Shauna Miller is thrusting Walmart into the style spotlight. Penny Chic, the 24-year-old stylist's blog, features looks fashioned entirely from the contents of the megastore's aisles. Think Miley Cyrus' line, never Marchesa -- and $5 pumps that trump $500 heels. ""More people shop at Walmart than anywhere else in the country, and yet no one in fashion talks about it,"" she said. ""I want to make great style accessible to everyone."" It began as a stylist's challenge -- a way to showcase her aesthetic talents in a fresh way. But after loyal followers grew by the thousands, Miller made Penny Chic her full-time job. Now, she said the website averages 52,000 unique visitors per month. ""It was amazing -- I still can't believe it,"" Miller said. ""It makes me feel like I am doing my part in a way, in the most that a stylist could do: giving people chic outfits at the lowest cost."" See San Francisco street styles . Ensembles, updated daily and displayed simply, typically range from $20 to $40. Miller selects Walmart pieces for versatility, often opting to mix and match or, in one case, doubling a necklace as a headpiece. ""It's a hands-on experience,"" she said. ""I have to touch and feel and look. I get a shopping cart and go through every item in the men's, women's, jewelry, lingerie departments."" Miller keeps her favorite goods and then returns the rest. Every aspect of Penny Chic is fueled by frugality, she said. ""After college, it was difficult to immediately find a job,"" she said. ""I know what it's like to be on a tight budget."" Photo shoots never involve glamour or high production, she said. Models need not apply. Work begins when Miller returns from a local Walmart with plastic bags full of ballet flats and scarves and beads. Then, she recruits a friend to play dress-up at her parents' house. After 10 minutes of careful styling (and giggling), the friend-model poses for Miller's mother's Nikon D200 camera. It's worlds away from her previous work at a Parisian fashion house. ""There's never the stranger variable in the mix -- we're all very close,"" Miller said. ""I don't want anyone to pout or try to look sexy. We just laugh and have fun."" See Boise street styles . For now, Miller's bargain hunting will remain exclusive to Walmart. But her blog posts aren't affiliated with the store. ""If Walmart offers me money, I won't take it,"" she said. ""It keeps my blogging pure, prevents it from becoming an advertisement."" Penny Chic styling may expand to other nationwide budget-friendly chains, however. She and her friends will soon launch tip-laden online video streaming on Penny Chic. Despite her retail lust for Chanel and Manolo Blahniks, Miller said future endeavors will focus on affordability. ""This process has taught me that fashion is fleeting,"" she said. ""Trends come and go. You have to work with what you have, and make it work.""","Penny Chic blog features outfits entirely from Walmart .

"Camping in the freezing snow at an altitude of 6,000 feet. Trekking through the jungle with an armed guard. Sitting on a boat in crocodile-infested waters. Craig Smith sure has done a lot to take a good picture. The chief financial officer from Orange County, California, has a second life as a wildlife photographer. His passion started early, at age 8. His grandparents gave him a camera before a trip to Yellowstone National Park, thinking he might like to photograph the bears. ""I struggled when I was young with focus, so they thought picture-taking would be a good hobby,"" he said. Since then, he's visited Africa 10 times, taken photos of animals on all seven continents, and been to both the North and South poles. He's photographed pandas in China, gorillas in Rwanda, lions in Namibia and polar bears in Norway. He'd ultimately like to take underwater photos of a Great White Shark. Experience the majesty of Smith's wildlife photography, and that of other CNN iReporters, in the gallery above. And if you'd like to shoot gorgeous animal photos of your own -- whether of the birds in your back yard or on a monthlong safari -- follow their tips below. 1. Get comfortable outside . If you want to take pictures of animals, you'll be spending a lot of time outside. ""Starting out, you need a passion for the outdoors,"" said Smith. ""Shooting animals is all about having enough time to linger for an extended amount of time waiting for the right shot."" 2. Start with a sure thing . For those who aren't used to shooting wildlife, photographer and iReporter Robert Ondrovic recommends visiting your local zoo for some practice. ""The variety of animals on display in a relatively confined area will give the beginner the opportunity to be up close to numerous species in a setting that makes them easy to capture,"" he said. Pets and backyard animals can also be good practice subjects. When you're ready to up the ante, head to a nearby state or national park to find and photograph animals in the wild. 3. Splurge on your lenses . ""Buy the absolute best lens you can -- glass makes all the difference in quality photographs -- and be less focused on the camera body,"" said Ondrovic. ""The 'guts' of most DSLRs in any brand are similar across the various lines"" (and prices). Although it's helpful to have a variety of lenses for capturing animals, if you're only going to buy one for your wildlife shots, make it a telephoto or super telephoto lens. ""It is a basic lens of wildlife [photography],"" said nature photographer Takayuki Maekawa, as it allows you to zoom in. ""More often than not, the animals are a distance away from you, and that is probably good idea since it is always preferable not to place yourself in close proximity to certain animals,"" advised Ondrovic. Smith recommends going with a 400-millimeter for the strongest close-ups. But if you're not sure, CNN producer Jessica Ellis, who is also a wildlife photographer, advises renting before you buy. ""Start at a local camera rental shop,"" she said. ""Test out a few of their DSLR beginner recommendations"" to find out what you like and are most comfortable with. Even if your budget limits you to a point-and-shoot camera rather than a higher-quality DSLR, make sure you get one with a good optical zoom. Digital zoom, which is achieved electronically rather than by adjustment of the camera's lens, reduces quality and can result in pixelation. This ""may not give you the clarity that makes for a good image,"" said photographer and iReporter Doug Mackenzie. 4. Skip the tripod . You might think a tripod is a good idea for capturing sharp photographs, but when it comes to animals, you'd be wrong, says Ondrovic. ""You may set up a tripod looking forward and an animal may suddenly appear to your left, right, [or] behind and you will miss the opportunity trying to get the angle if mounted on a tripod,"" he explained. If you're looking for more stability, ""a monopod would be a good thing to buy instead of a tripod,"" advised Smith. Its single leg will help steady the camera without limiting your range of motion like a tripod can. 5. Be patient . ""If you think things happen quickly like the Internet, social media or sports, you will be disappointed,"" warned Smith. He spent hours hiking through the ""dense jungle"" of Rwanda and Uganda over three different trips to capture a stunning close-up of a mountain gorilla. ""If you want to photograph wildlife, you have to be quiet and when you see them, you have to move slowly and try not to scare them,"" added freelance photographer Billy Ocker. ""I always look for their tracks on the ground."" ""Animals don't pose and seldom smile on cue,"" agreed Mackenzie. ""You have to learn to be very, very patient. It could take hours, days or even years to get just the right shot."" Maekawa will spend up to 10 hours a day waiting for a photo -- and has been shooting some species for more than 10 years. 6. Change your perspective . As you're clicking away, think about the perspective and goal of your images. For Smith, that means creating ""a special relationship between the animal being photographed and the person viewing the picture."" As a result, he likes to shoot from the animal's perspective -- ""get on your knees and shoot at their level."" Maekawa tries to capture the human side of the animals he shoots, while Ondrovic focuses on their wildness. ""My goal as a wildlife photographer these days is to photograph animals in their natural settings, unencumbered by artificial environments such as zoo captivity, and show their beauty as they were meant to be,"" he said. And Ellis hopes to pass along an environmental message with her pictures. ""I hope to bring people closer to nature ... to pass on a message that we all must strive to minimize our impact on the earth,"" she said. 7. Capture the eyes . They're the windows to the soul, you know, and Mackenzie says they're also the key to a stunning animal portrait. ""They will help you tell the story and give the image that extra spark of life that will touch you and all those who eventually see the image,"" he said. ""Get as close as possible."" 8. Know your equipment . Imagine how you'd feel if you dropped a wad of cash on a fancy new camera, went on your fabulous safari vacation, saw a majestic lion posing perfectly -- and couldn't figure out how to turn off your flash or adjust your aperture. Give yourself plenty of time and opportunities for practice before your holiday of a lifetime. ""There is nothing worse than buying the latest hot camera and leaving the next day, hoping it was be the thing that gets you that award-winning photo,"" warned Mackenzie. 9. Anticipate . ""Animals are unpredictable,"" said Smith. They're not going to hold their pose for you, so try to anticipate and start snapping before they strike that perfect silhouette or move into just the right spot. ""Look for the anticipative moment,"" advised Mackenzie. ""One of the most common things for us all to do is to be watching the action in front of us and forget to push the little button."" 10. Shoot, shoot, shoot . All our experts agree that more is more when it comes to photographing wildlife. ""Shoot and shoot. Experiment!"" said Smith. Take photos at ""different exposures, different shutter speeds, different apertures"" to see what works best, advises Mackenzie. Shoot from a variety of angles and times to capture different light levels, said Maekawa, and be sure to capture the animal making a variety of expressions. Finally, whatever you do, bring lots and lots of digital storage and extra batteries so you can click away without worry.

"Washington (CNN) -- Congress will miss President Obama's deadline to enact health care reform by the end of the year, a key Democratic senator said Tuesday. Illinois' Dick Durbin, the second-highest ranking Democrat in the Senate, said he hopes, at best, to pass the Senate's version of a health care bill by that time. If the Senate manages to pass a bill, a congressional conference committee would need to merge the House and Senate proposals into a consensus version requiring final approval from each chamber before moving to Obama's desk to be signed into law. Durbin's assessment came as former President Clinton made a rare visit to Capitol Hill to discuss the health care issue with Senate Democrats. Clinton tried but ultimately failed to pass a health care overhaul in the early 1990s. The failure is considered one of the reasons for the GOP takeover of Congress in the 1994 midterm elections. ""Whatever their differences are, I just urged them to resolve their differences and pass a bill,"" Clinton said on Capitol Hill. ""I also believe, you know, people hired us to come to work in places like this to solve problems and stand up and do it."" Clinton told the senators that they had a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to push through a reform package that is crucial to the country's long-term economic health. ""He made a strong case for getting it done this year,"" said Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon. ""He is brilliant,"" said Sen. Kent Conrad of North Dakota. ""He is able to penetrate through the fog of policy and politics better than any person I've heard."" Durbin blamed the shifting timeline on a slower-than-expected cost analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office on legislation being crafted under Reid's direction. He also cited an uncertain schedule for floor debate. Durbin said he hopes debate in the full Senate will begin before Thanksgiving. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid himself has signaled uncertainty over whether the fractious Senate could meet Obama's goal of passing a bill this year. Among the many obstacles Reid is facing is whether to include a government-run public option. The majority leader has proposed including an option that would give states until 2014 to decide whether to opt out. But several Democratic moderates -- as well as Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine, the lone Senate Republican to vote for reform -- have expressed deep reservations over the idea. Reid has little room to compromise and maneuver. He would need the support of every Senate Democrat and Connecticut independent Joe Lieberman -- an opponent of the public option -- to get the 60 votes necessary to cut off a likely GOP filibuster. Lieberman has faced a backlash from Democrats and liberal protesters over his threat to filibuster any bill that included a public option. On Tuesday, police arrested six demonstrators in Lieberman's Capitol Hill office after a group protesting his views on health care legislation refused to leave. Lieberman was not there at the time. A group calling itself the Mobilization for Health Care for All littered the floor and hallway with symbolic ""money"" and said that campaign donations to Lieberman by the insurance industry have affected his judgment of health care legislation. The group is upset that Lieberman refuses to support the public option, which they believe would reduce the number of people without health care insurance. Democrats. meanwhile, could resort to reconciliation -- a budgetary maneuver that would require only a simple majority in the 100-vote chamber -- but such a move would add complications to the legislative process and further erode what is already a poisonous political atmosphere. Democratic leaders in the House and the Senate, however, have reached agreement on a broad range of changes that could affect every American's coverage. Among other things, they have agreed to subsidize insurance for a family of four making up to roughly $88,000 annually, or 400 percent of the federal poverty level. They've also agreed to expand Medicaid and create health insurance exchanges to make it easier for small businesses, the self-employed and the unemployed to pool resources and purchase less expensive coverage. They'd also limit total out-of-pocket expenses and prevent insurance companies from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions. Insurers would also be barred from charging higher premiums based on a person's gender or medical history. CNN's Ted Barrett, Dana Bash, Paul Courson, Jill Dougherty, Brianna Keilar and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.","Dick Durbin hopes to have Senate version of bill passed by end of year .

"Passengers who were aboard Asiana Airlines Flight 214, which crashed in San Francisco, began legal action against Boeing Co., which made the plane, according to a law firm representing passengers. Boeing, which is headquartered in Chicago, declined comment. Spokeswoman Debbie Heathers referred all calls to the National Transportation Safety Board. Ribbeck Law Chartered, a Chicago-based law firm, said Tuesday that it had filed the initial court petition on behalf of more than 80 passengers. The firm said Asiana Airlines will be added as a defendant in the next few days. Legal action will also be taken against several unidentified ""component part manufacturers who may be responsible for this disaster,"" the firm said in a statement. Asiana spokesman Ki Won Suh declined to comment on the law firm's plans against the airline. The Asiana 777 fell short of its approach and crashed on the runway at San Francisco airport on July 6. Three people were killed and more than 180 others hurt. Seconds before crash, passengers knew they were too low . The NTSB is investigating. The early stage of the investigation has focused heavily on actions of the crew during the landing attempt. The law firm filed a petition for discovery in Cook County Circuit Court in Illinois, and the petition ""demands that the court orders the defendants to immediately release to the victims of the crash all relevant evidence concerning design and manufacturing records of the accident aircraft as well as any records concerning its maintenance,"" the law firm said in a statement. The 83 passengers represented by the firm include some who have serious back injuries, broken legs and brain trauma, said attorney Monica R. Kelly. During the crash, sliding ramps deployed inside the plane, blocking passengers' access to the exit door and trapping them inside the burning plane, the law firm alleged. Also, passengers were injured when seats collapsed during the crash-landing, Kelly said. The law firm also cites reports that the crash could have been caused by ""a mechanical malfunction of the auto-throttle,"" according to the firm's statement.

"(CNN)The video appears to give us a rare glimpse into a police officer's reaction after the fatal shooting of an unarmed man. Officer Grant Morrison approaches a patrol car and collapses. Fellow officers help him up, and he keels over the hood of the car, face in hand, sobbing. ""I thought he was going to pull a gun on me,"" Morrison, an officer in Billings, Montana, tells one of the officers assisting him. Since Missouri teen Michael Brown's death prompted a move to put body cameras on all of America's policeman, Americans will likely witness more recordings of the crucial moment when an officer decides to pull the trigger. It's ugly, as a dash cam from Morrison's patrol car reminds us. The video was presented as part of a coroner's inquest into the April shooting of Richard Ramirez. A squad car's headlights shine on Morrison as he walks away from a dark driveway in the background, where he had pulled over a car carrying Ramirez, who Morrison thought was a suspect in an armed robbery and shooting. Morrison shot the man after he did not comply with orders to keep his hands in sight, dash cam video shows. When Morrison reaches his fellow officer's squad car -- with its dash cam also running -- he keels forward to the ground. He's not wounded, but he sounds as though he's hyperventilating. Morrison had just learned Ramirez, whom he shot three times, was unarmed. Morrison appears to sob when he stands back up, his voice squelching when he tells a colleague he thought his life was in danger. A colleague holds tight to Morrison as he appears to cry in heaves doubled over on the hood of the car. Another officer asks Morrison if she should call his wife. It was the second time the drug enforcement officer had shot and killed someone. Both times, dash cams were rolling. Both times Morrison faced an inquiry and the shootings were ruled justifiable, partly based on testimony analyzing the video, according to local media reports. In Ramirez's case, Morrison said he was facing a suspected armed robber and shooter who he thought might pull a gun on him, CNN affiliate KULR reported. ""I wish I just knew he didn't have a gun but I couldn't take the risk,"" Morrison told a court earlier this month. ""I couldn't take the risk of him having a gun. I wanted to go home to my family and I wanted to see my son grow up."" Despite the emotional breakdown -- and despite the inquest clearing Morrison of wrongdoing -- responses to a message posted by the Billings police chief on Facebook indicate there are plenty who feel Morrison used excessive force. ""He started out dropping f-bombs at the guy and then drew his pistol. He barely gave the guy a chance to surrender before plugging him three times at point blank range. This policeman is a murderer plain and simple,"" Tony Galasso wrote. ""Even a blind man can see (and hear) that this was wrongdoing on the coward cop's part. He was all jacked up as soon as he got to the car. Swearing and yelling. He clearly knew who the guy he shot was and wanted to shoot him by the sound of his voice,"" Art Sharrard wrote. One person even invoked the so-called loud-music murder trial in Florida, in which Michael Dunn was convicted of murder, despite his claim that he saw a gun and acted in self-defense. ""It's odd that Michael Dunn was convicted for murder in the first degree of Jordan Davis, even as his claim to self-defense against an imaginary weapon was nearly identical to Morrison's,"" Troy Crumbo wrote. Morrison and the Billings police had their supporters, too. ""Folks, when a cop stops you, it's not about you. It's about law and order. Help out. Do what you're told,"" Mona Letourneau responded, while Bryce Saunders posted, ""Well said, Chief!! Thanks for all you and your Department do for the Citizens of Billings keeping everyone safe."" The other shooting involving Morrison happened in February 2013 in front of a suspected drug house. A man reached for a gun in his pocket. It turned out to be a BB gun, the Billings Gazette reported after the inquiry. That incident was also caught on video, and on it, you can hear Morrison and another man escalating into a shouting match. ""Get on the ground now!"" Morrison yells. ""I'm going to (expletive) shoot you!"" The male voice continues shouting at the officer, who keeps commanding him to get onto the ground. There's a pulsating electric sound -- perhaps a Taser -- then a bang that sounds like a gunshot. ""You shot him?"" a woman's voice later asks. ""He had a gun in pocket,"" Morrison answers. ""He had a BB gun,"" she yells. ""I didn't know that,"" Morrison responds. The man later died of his wounds.

"(CNN) -- It was Taylor Anderson's dream come true to be living in Japan. Then, the March 11 earthquake hit. The 24-year-old American had been teaching English to elementary and middle school students in Ishinomaki, a coastal city of about 160,000 in Miyagi Prefecture for more than two years. But her passion for the Japanese culture was ignited long before she arrived in the country. She began studying the language in middle school, her parents said. As a student at Randolph-Macon College in Ashland, Virginia, she constantly sought ways to share all things Japan with the community. She led book readings of Japanese literature and organized trips to photography exhibits, friends say. She often showed up at the Alpha Gamma Delta sorority house with Japanese snacks to share with her housemates. ""She was never afraid to have such a love of another culture. Some people would hold it back... but she shared it with us; I felt like we were a part of it,"" Katie Garin Langley said. ""When she found out she was going to Japan, it was such a blessing for her. It was just her dream come true."" Anderson, the oldest of Andy and Jeanne Anderson's three children, joined the Japan Exchange and Teaching program shortly after graduation in August 2008 and was scheduled to return in August. Her parents last heard from her two days before the March 11 earthquake, which triggered a massive tsunami that devastated parts of northeast Japan, including the town where Anderson lived. Her parents said she was last seen after the earthquake riding her bike away from an elementary school after making sure parents picked up their children. Her family spread the word of her disappearance on Facebook; her high school, St. Catherine's School, held a prayer vigil in her honor last Thursday. On Monday, her family announced that the wait had ended. ""It is with deep regret that we inform you that earlier this morning we received a call from the U.S. Embassy in Japan that they had found our beloved Taylor's body,"" her family said in a statement. ""We would like to thank all those whose prayers and support have carried us through this crisis. Please continue to pray for all who remain missing and for the people of Japan. We ask that you respect our privacy during this hard time."" Her death sent shockwaves through her hometown of Chesterfield, Virginia, as well as her college community. ""There's a great lesson in the fact that Taylor followed her passion, went to Japan and taught youngsters and did exactly what she wanted to do and loved doing it and did very well,"" Robert Lindgren, president of Randolph-Macon College said in a statement. Her exuberance for Japan permeated all aspects of her, her friends said. ""She was just so happy to be alive. She took each day as it was and she was just so thrilled to be here and be alive and to make someone happy. She was just infectious. If you were in a bad mood and you saw Taylor, you couldn't help but be in a good mood,"" Langley said. ""She always put people first. She always cared about other people more than herself. It showed how genuine of a person she was and how nice she really was,"" friend and fellow sorority sister Mary Anne Dalle Valle said. She leaves behind a legacy of kindness -- and the memory of a bright smile -- that her friends say will stick with them. ""She was just absolutely lovely and she was completely genuine and so much fun and easy going and a friend to everyone,"" friend and sorority sister Virginia Seatherton said. ""We may have lost her as a person but she'll live on in everything she did and in each of us. She'll always be with us."" CNN's Eric Fiegel contributed to this report.","Taylor Anderson's passion for Japan led her to Miyagi Prefecture to teach English .

"(CNN) -- Who'd be a referee? When the crowd aren't getting on your back you've got the players acting up or giving you an earful. So if someone described your refereeing as ""the best,"" you could be forgiven for feeling a small surge of pride. But when the person praising you has been called the world's most notorious match fixer, then it's time to show yourself a red card. Wilson Raj Perumal says he corrupted many football players and officials during a long criminal career, but there is one person who stands out from the crowd. His name was Ibrahim Chaibou, a referee from Niger. ""He was the best, he was the best, but not from FIFA's point of view,"" Perumal told CNN during a wide-ranging television interview about his match-fixing days. Perfect partner . The Singaporean, who is now helping European police with match-fixing investigations, claims to have rigged the results of up to 100 matches over a 20-year period, boasting of a 70-80% success rate. Chaibou, who he describes as ""very bold,"" became one of his favourite match officials. According to Perumal, the referee's first match fix was an international friendly between South Africa and Guatemala in May 2010 -- one of several warm-up matches played ahead of the 2010 World Cup which the Rainbow Nation hosted. Watching highlights of the game on YouTube, Perumal gives a running commentary on the major incidents. ""It's crazy,"" Perumal says as Chaibou awards South Africa a penalty kick. The quality of the footage is poor, but the fixer knows what happened. ""This is not a penalty. The offence took place outside the box,"" he says. The man from Niger is allegedly at it again in the second half, this time awarding Guatemala a penalty for a handball. Replays show the ball striking a South African player's chest. Chaibou awarded three penalties in all during the match and, according to Perumal, fulfilled his task of overseeing a high-scoring fixture. The game finished 5-0 to South Africa. ""We paid him very good money,"" Perumal says. Elaborate scheme . Perumal says getting Chaibou onto the pitch was the result of an elaborate scheme where the match-fixer used his now-defunct company 'Football 4 U International' to target the South African Football Association (SAFA). ""I had this idea to influence the warm-up games without the knowledge of the association concerned. ""So I remember writing a formal letter to the association requesting that my company 'Football 4 U' supply referees from Africa at our expense,"" Perumal explains. Supplying referees in this way is a breach of FIFA rules, but Perumal's idea was accepted. ""It is clear that the convicted criminal and football match-fixer, Wilson Raj Perumal, was involved in convincing SAFA to agree to a company then managed by him [Football4U] to select, fund and appoint referees,"" said a FIFA statement in March 2012. FIFA also had act over a mini tournament in Antalya, Turkey in February 2011. Fixers at an Asian-based syndicate approached the Football Associations of Bolivia, Bulgaria, Latvia and Estonia inviting them to an all-expenses paid event. But they were all duped, because the referees had allegedly been paid to fix the results. Terry Steans, a FIFA investigator between 2010 and 2012, recalls the set up. ""It involved four international teams and an empty stadium, no ticket sales and yet the game was (open) for betting,"" Steans explains. ""I sat and watched match fixers with a briefcase full of cash to pay the referees."" Seven goals were scored in the two matches played -- all of them from the penalty spot. ""I think that's the most shocking for me to see a fixing syndicate in total control of two international friendlies, played in the same stadium to no crowd at all. It's eerie, absolutely eerie,"" Steans said. FIFA handed down life bans for the six match officials who Perumal says were targeted by his former associates in Singapore. Paying the penalty . Perumal insists he wasn't involved in the Turkey scandal -- one of the most notorious and brazen match fixes of recent times -- but his fingerprints were clearly all over the warm-up matches in South Africa. A FIFA report, seen by CNN, concluded that the match involving Chaibou was ""manipulated for betting fraud purposes"" and noted that ""several SAFA members were either easily duped or extremely foolish"" when organizing the games. Chaibou continued officiating into 2011, notably taking charge of an international friendly match between Nigeria and Argentina in Abuja in June that year. Nigeria played a match against a second-string Argentina side -- a surprising detail in itself, but what caught the eye was how the match ended. When 90 minutes of regulation play was over, Nigeria was leading 4-0. Four or five minutes were due to be added for injury time, but the score remained the same. Chaibou kept the match going. In the 98th minute he awarded a penalty to Argentina for a handball that replays show never happened. Argentina converted the penalty and the match ended 4-1. Analysis of betting patterns by FIFA revealed a surge in bets for a fifth goal to be scored. Chaibou, who retired from refereeing before FIFA could take disciplinary action, denies fixing matches, but isn't saying much more. When contacted by CNN, the former referee said: ""I have put an end to my career and everything is finished."" He added: ""What is past is past."" For what it's worth, Perumal thinks referees should be paid more. ""They get about $1,000 or maybe $1,500 (per game) which is very small money. In my opinion, FIFA should pay them a lot more or they should start to professionalize this officiating."" When asked about the payment of referees, FIFA told CNN: ""Corruption does not depend on how much you are paid, but instead, and above all, honesty and values of the individual."" Steans says the time may have come to protect referees from the fixers. ""When you're on your own it's very difficult to turn down two or three guys that are pressuring you,"" he says. ""It's the easiest thing in the world to write a manual and say this is how you should react. In the real world, it's a difficult thing in isolation to do for a referee. So they're vulnerable and I feel they'd need more protection."" Read more: The man who fixed football matches .

"Djerba, Tunisia (CNN) -- President Barack Obama said Thursday he approved the use of U.S. military aircraft to help return to Egypt those Egyptian citizens who have fled to Tunisia to escape unrest in neighboring Libya as the United Nations called for stepped-up aid to refugees. Nearly 180,000 people, mainly foreign workers, have fled to the neighboring nations of Tunisia and Egypt amid fighting between government troops and rebels pushing to oust longtime strongman Moammar Gadhafi, the U.N. refugee agency reported. About 95,000 people have crossed into Tunisia and another 83,000 into Egypt, the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees estimated. But it was the would-be migrants stuck in Libya that was most concerning to Abeer Etefa, who on the Tunisian side of the border with Libya. ""We're worried about people on the other side of the border,"" said the spokeswoman for the U.N.'s World Food Programme. ""We're calling for humanitarian safe passage to deliver food inside to people in Tripoli and elsewhere."" She said she had heard stories from recent arrivals of food shortages ""in many places of Libya."" She praised the efforts of Tunisians along the border, but said their generosity had limits. ""They've provided all they could,"" she said, adding that they ""can't continue."" In Washington, Obama told reporters that he also authorized the U.S. Agency for International Development to charter additional planes ""to help people from other countries find their way home."" ""Tens of thousands of people from many different countries are fleeing Libya, and we commend the governments of Tunisia and Egypt for their response, even as they go through their own political transitions,"" Obama said. Zuheir Badr El-Din, the top airport official in the Tunisian city of Djerba, told CNN that France plans to fly chartered jets between that coastal city and Cairo six times a day for five days. Chaos has reigned on the Tunisian border for days as thousands have clamored to get out of Libya, and many have found themselves trapped in a no-man's land between the two countries. Thousands more were housed in tents provided by UNHCR and the Tunisian military, and many have little money and no travel documents with them. In Djerba, about 90 km (55 miles) from the border, hundreds of refugees waited Thursday for flights out. Some napped on the floor; others sat up against the walls waiting. But the process appeared orderly, given the number of would-be passengers, as airport officials moved them along in orderly lines with no pushing or shoving. The majority carried only small bags containing the bare necessities that they managed to escape with. One elderly man's luggage consisted of a tightly wrapped blanket -- the only possession that survived his journey out of Libya. Earlier Thursday, UNHCR sounded an urgent appeal to governments to help in the mass evacuation required to get people out. And after a call among Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and representatives of Middle Eastern, European and U.N. organizations, the world body called for help to avert a humanitarian disaster. ""There is a strong need for urgent relief -- food, water, sanitation and shelter to the thousands on both sides of the Tunisian and Egyptian borders due to significant population movements, mainly of migrant workers,"" a U.N. statement warned. ""It is also necessary to prepare for a further possible escalation of humanitarian needs should conditions deteriorate inside Libya."" The participants in Thursday's talks, which included the Arab League, the European Union and the Organization of the Islamic Conference, urged Libya to allow ""immediate and unimpeded access"" to determine what was needed. ""The situation here remains tense,"" said Firas Kayal, a spokesman for the U.N. refugee agency on the Tunisian border. ""There is lots of congestion on this side of the border and we are hearing that many thousands are waiting on the Libyan side to come through. Village bakeries have increased production to feed the stranded, he said. ""The local community has been so generous in providing food, medicines and places to stay, but the capacity of the local community is reaching its limit because the numbers are so huge,"" he said. The refugees include Bangladeshis, Vietnamese, Thais, Koreans, Malians, Ghanaians and Sudanese who had entered Libya seeking work. But most of the workers are Egyptian citizens, and that country's caretaker government has paid for flights from Djerba to Cairo to take them home.

"In New Orleans, food is a way of life -- it's as ingrained there as Spanish moss and Bourbon Street. Gumbo flows like the sweet sounds of jazz; po-boys are stuffed with fried shrimp from the bayous where the Acadian settlers chose to place their roots. So it's understandable that while growing up in The Big Easy, Darrin Cook's childhood revolved around food. Every meal had an appetizer, an entrée and dessert. The word ""salad"" wasn't in his family's vocabulary. They celebrated Saints games with barbecues and brownies. ""Food and I went together like red beans and rice,"" Cook, 21, writes in his upcoming book, ""The Weight of New Orleans."" By middle school, he weighed more than 300 pounds. ""No one told me, 'You don't have to eat it all.' I used to stuff myself until I was sick."" Cook hid behind school work and dark clothes, his mom Monique says. He tended to socialize with people who were also obese, and his humble nature kept him out of the spotlight. ""I really felt his pain,"" Monique says, ""but I made sure he knew that he was a handsome man -- that people were not looking at the weight. They loved Darrin because of his personality."" Monique struggled with fear for her son's health. She knew his eating habits were dangerous, but she didn't know how to bring it up. ""I was really in denial as his mom. I never told him that I thought he was obese, that never came out of my mouth. That's my baby; I didn't want to hurt his feelings."" Still it was hard for Cook to ignore his weight. People called Cook ""Little Darrin,"" as his dad was ""Big Darrin."" Family members used to tease the young boy, saying he should be the one called ""Big Darrin."" At a birthday party, friends told him he'd have to stay on shore while they went on a paddle boat ride -- he was so big it might sink. ""People don't realize how cruel they can be,"" Cook says. Mother Nature can be crueler. Hurricane Katrina headed toward New Orleans in late August 2005. The Cook family wasn't going to evacuate. Like many residents of the Upper 9th Ward, they were used to riding storms out at home. But after seeing warnings from police, they headed toward Alexandria, Louisiana. The normally three and a half hour drive took them 24. All the hotels in Alexandria were full. Hearing reports of flooding at home, the family continued on to Dallas to stay with Cook's great-aunt. Fifteen relatives invaded the house. Cook slept in the living room with his cousins and started attending a local high school. At dinner, he shoveled in Zatarain's products like they were memories he was trying not to forget. ""My whole life was turned upside down,"" he says. ""The only thing I had left to hold to was the food. That was New Orleans -- the food."" His beloved home flooded with 6 feet of water. When his family returned to New Orleans in January 2006, very few food places were open. Cook remembers eating hot sausages and shrimp from the corner store almost every day. Rally's and McDonald's rounded out his diet. The weight continued to pile on. At his heaviest, Cook weighed 390 pounds. It's not lost on Cook that Sea World -- home to the famous Shamu whale -- was the surprising birth place of his weight loss journey. The 16-year-old was on vacation with his family in the summer of 2006 and wanted to swim with dolphins. Unfortunately, the staff had trouble finding a life vest to fit him. Humiliated, he realized he needed to make a change. ""I was tired of lying to myself. All the dreams I had were going to fade away."" Cook returned home to New Orleans and talked his goals over with childhood friend Semone Jackson. ""It kind of surprised me,"" she says, ""because weight never was a topic of conversation between us growing up. He didn't really let it affect him."" But like most things he tackled in life, Cook took his weight loss plan seriously. He cut out fast food, soda, sweets and most processed products. He ate at Subway a lot -- a six-inch turkey breast on wheat with no cheese for lunch. Then he would eat the other six inches of the sub for dinner. ""Darrin is really, really strict on himself and what he eats,"" Jackson says. ""If you're eating something sweet, he won't even ask for some."" Cook also started walking every day around the man-made lake in his neighborhood. At first it was one loop -- a mile. Then it was two. His mom joined him some mornings and people began noticing a change in his body just three weeks in. ""It was just fascinating,"" Monique says. ""People were actually cheering. Neighbors started walking as well. Many people in our community started getting active because of Darrin."" After six months, he had dropped 90 pounds. Cook graduated high school at 16 and headed to college. During the next four years, he lost an additional 85 pounds, bringing his current weight to 215. He wears a size 36 pants -- and tries to avoid dark colors. ""It almost felt like I was invisible with that weight,"" he says. ""The world, it was almost like I wasn't noticed. It wasn't until I lost the weight that it was like, 'Hey, I arrived.' "" Cook's got a little GQ in him now, Jackson says with a laugh. Her friend is still the same on the inside, but the ""teddy bear"" has turned into a good-looking young man. ""I've noticed that a lot of females, young ladies, they kind of tend to gravitate to him more."" Cook is an entrepreneur -- CEO of My Mogul Media -- and splits his time between New Orleans and an office in Atlanta. He hopes to travel the country speaking to young teens who are struggling with weight like he once did. He turns 22 in August. ""He has always been a young fellow in an old man's body,"" his mom says. ""Everywhere he goes he really touches people. He's just my angel on Earth."" Cook carries granola bars with him at all times and eats oatmeal for breakfast. He's learned to split meals at restaurants and drink water instead of soda. He has a trainer and tries to work out at least 30 minutes every day. His goal weight is 185 pounds. ""It's not going to be an easy road,"" Cook says. ""I weigh myself every day. [But] losing weight ... made me much more confident in myself. If I can conquer this weight, where most people struggle, I can do anything.""","Darrin Cook is a 21-year-old entrepreneur and CEO of My Mogul Media .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Rapper Macklemore, who won a Grammy for a song praised for its cultural sensitivity, insists that he wasn't stereotyping Jews with a costume he wore to a Seattle event Friday. The hat, big fake nose, black beard and wig were ""a random costume"" thrown together ""so that I could walk around unnoticed and surprise the crowd with a short performance,"" the rapper said in an ""apology to anybody that I may have offended"" released Monday night. While the Anti-Defamation League said the group would ""take him at his word that he did not have any ill intent,"" comedian Seth Rogen failed to see the comedy, calling Macklemore out on Twitter for wearing an ""anti-Semitic costume"" while performing his hit song ""Thrift Shop."" ""@macklemore, first you trick people into thinking you're a rapper, now you trick them into thinking you're Jewish?"" he tweeted. Such criticism may be a new experience for Macklemore, who became the progressive darling of the music industry last year when he and producing partner Ryan Lewis released ""Same Love."" The song became an anthem for the same-sex marriage movement, and the duo was rewarded with four Grammys. Macklemore apologizes for Grammy win . ""Family, friends and fans alike who know me well, know that I'm absolutely not the person described in certain headlines today,"" Macklemore said in Monday's statement. ""There is no worse feeling than being misunderstood, especially when people are hurt or offended."" Macklemore said the misunderstanding happened because he wanted to surprise fans at a show at Seattle's EMP Museum on Friday night. ""Earlier in the day I thought it would be fun to dress up in a disguise and go incognito to the event, so that I could walk around unnoticed and surprise the crowd with a short performance,"" he said.Â . ""I picked up a bunch of fake mustaches and beards and grabbed a leftover wig from our recent trip to Japan,"" he said. The only fake nose he could find at a costume store at the last minute was ""a big witch nose."" His only aim was to disguise himself, not to be ""any 'type' of person,"" he said.Â ""I wasn't attempting to mimic any culture, nor resemble one.Â  A 'Jewish stereotype' never crossed my mind."" Some people who saw him suggested that he looked like former Beatle Ringo Starr or President Abraham Lincoln, he said. He said it was ""surprising and disappointing"" that photos of his ""disguise were sensationalized leading to the immediate assertion that my costume was anti-Semitic."" He did, however, ""acknowledge how the costume could, within a context of stereotyping, be ascribed to a Jewish caricature."" B'nai B'rith International, a Jewish advocacy group, said the costume was ""deeply offensive and propagates Jewish stereotypes."" ""His costume choice and subsequent response demonstrate an utter lack of sensitivity,"" a statement from the group said. ""Stereotypes are dangerous and offensive. Stereotypes dehumanize -- removing individuality and promoting intolerance."" Rogen isn't buying Macklemore's ""random costume"" explanation. ""@macklemore really?? Because if I told someone to put together an anti Semitic Jew costume, they'd have that exact shopping list."" The Anti-Defamation League said in a statement Tuesday that it welcomed Macklemore's apology. ""We take him at his word that he did not have any ill intent and unreservedly accept his apology,"" ADL National Director Abraham Foxman said. ""We know that Macklemore is someone who has used his platform in the past to stand up and speak out against intolerance and bigotry, particularly homophobia. With that in mind we believe that this matter is little more than 'a tempest in a teapot' over an unfortunate choice of wardrobe."" Macklemore said his ""body of work and the causes for which I've supported speak for themselves."" Critics should ""take a few moments to discover the human and artist that I strive to be."" ""I respect all cultures and all people,"" he said. ""I would never intentionally put down anybody for the fabric that makes them who they are. I love human beings, love originality, and ... happen to love a weird outfit from time to time."" Ryan Lewis on his mother's battle with HIV .

"NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (CNN) -- A Louisiana appeals court has removed a Lasalle Parish judge from the remaining ""Jena Six"" cases, court officials told CNN Friday. Protesters gather at Jena High School during a civil rights march on September 20, 2007, in Jena, Louisiana. Attorneys for four of the defendants had asked 9th Judicial District Judge Thomas Yeager to recuse Judge J.P. Mauffrey Jr. They said Mauffrey ""had made numerous statements on numerous occasions"" indicating he had already decided on a defendant's guilt and punishment. ""Indeed, Judge Mauffrey has expressed his belief generally that Jesse Ray [Beard] and his African-American friends are guilty, not only of the misconduct alleged in this matter, but of several other acts of misconduct as well,"" according to court documents filed in the case. A court official said Friday Yeager had found that the appearance of impropriety existed and recused Mauffrey. Beard is one of six black Jena High School students accused of beating a white student during a school fight on December 4, 2006. The case drew national headlines when the teens initially were charged with second-degree attempted murder after they allegedly knocked out Justin Barker while stomping and kicking him. After the charges triggered protests, they were reduced to aggravated second-degree battery. One of the teens, Mychal Bell, reached a plea agreement on a battery charge in juvenile court. Dale Hickman, an attorney who represents another youth, Bryant Purvis, told CNN Mauffrey's removal was good news for his case. The judge tended to view the group as ""six thugs"" and not individuals, he said. Hickman added he would be concerned about the outcome of a trial held before Mauffrey if his client waived his right to a jury. CNN's Sean Callebs contributed to this report.","9th Judicial District Judge Thomas Yeager recuses Judge J.P. Mauffrey Jr.

"More new judges. Faster appointments to top government jobs. Revised regulations and rules reflecting government policy. Those are the practical impacts from the nuclear option Senate Democrats approved to end filibusters of most presidential nominations and appointments. Obama supports Senate's nuclear option to end some filibusters . The politics of the move are messy, with majority Democrats saying it was needed to end unprecedented obstruction by minority Republicans, and Republicans contending it was a power grab. Both sides are right, at least in part. Here are five things that will change because of the move: . 1. Easing Senate gridlock . First and foremost, eliminating the ability of senators to block most nominations means the majority party -- in this case Democrats -- can hold votes and approve presidential nominations and appointments more quickly. Before the rule change, minority senators could mount a filibuster that required 60 votes in the 100-member chamber to overcome. With Democrats holding a 55-45 majority, the filibuster served as an effective minority veto. Once a rare maneuver of specific opposition, the filibuster has become routine, especially since President Barack Obama took office in 2009. According to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, the Nevada Democrat who spearheaded Thursday's nuclear option rule change, there have been 168 filibusters of executive and judicial nominations in Senate history, with about half of them occurring during the Obama administration. In the Senate's first move after the 52-48 vote Thursday to change the rules, it ended a filibuster against one of Obama's three nominees for a key federal appeals court in Washington who had been blocked by Republicans. The altered filibuster rules also will apply when the day comes that Republicans hold the Senate majority, a fact emphasized by GOP leaders who decried the change. ""This changes everything,"" veteran Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona told reporters Thursday. He blamed newer Democratic senators who never served as the minority party for pushing the issue, adding: ""They succeeded and they will pay a very, very heavy price for it."" What is the nuclear option? 2. More new judges . Obama and Democrats have complained for months that Republicans prevented the President from filling three vacancies on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, considered the nation's second most important judicial body behind the Supreme Court because it handles many major government-related cases. The D.C. appeals court became the focal point of the filibuster issue, with Republicans blocking the three Obama nominees to prevent a more liberal-leaning majority on the panel that now has eight judges --four considered conservative and four considered more liberal. GOP leaders argue the court caseload doesn't require any more judges on the panel. Now, the three Obama nominees -- Patricia Millett, Robert Wilkins and Cornelia Pillard -- are likely to get Senate approval to join the D.C. court in coming weeks or months. Upcoming cases the court could consider include challenges to tougher EPA limits on carbon emissions and other regulatory issues. The Senate rule change specifically exempted Supreme Court nominations, meaning they still can be filibustered, though some Republicans argue that no such distinction exists. If Reid ""changes the rules for some judicial nominees, he is effectively changing them for all judicial nominees, including the Supreme Court,"" conservative GOP Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa said. ""Apparently the other side wants to change the rules while still preserving the ability to block a Republican President's ability to replace a liberal Supreme Court Justice with an originalist."" Both sides have been guilty of political hijinks over judicial nominees in the past. During the administration of President George W. Bush, Republicans who held the Senate majority in 2005 threatened the nuclear option to prevent Democratic filibusters of Bush's judicial nominees. The confrontation was averted thanks to an agreement by a bipartisan group of 14 senators. Obama, then a senator, opposed the nuclear option at that time, saying on the Senate floor that ""in the long run, it is not a good result for either party."" Asked about Obama's past stance compared with his support Thursday for Reid's move, White House spokesman Josh Earnest cited increased obstruction of Obama nominees as the reason for needing to get the Senate working again. ""The circumstances have unfortunately changed for the worse since 2005,"" Earnest said, noting that there were 50 judicial vacancies when Obama took office compared to 93 today, and that many of the President's nominees have bipartisan support but can't get an up-or-down Senate vote. Grassley, however, noted that almost half of the 93 judicial vacancies today lack a nominee by the President. 3. Executive branch appointments . When Obama nominated Chuck Hagel as his defense secretary, the choice seemed safe from major Republican opposition in the Senate because Hagel himself was a former Republican senator. However, the bitter partisan divide of Washington brought a GOP filibuster that initially prevented a final vote -- the first time in history that a defense secretary nominee had been blocked. ""What seems to be happening, and this has been growing over time, is the Republican minority in the Senate seems to think that the rule now is that you need to have 60 votes for everything,"" Obama complained at the time. The rule change means that Obama and future presidents will be able to fill Cabinet posts and agency leadership positions more freely so long as their party controls the Senate. However, if divided government means the president is of a different party than the Senate majority, look for even more obstruction of such appointments in the future. 4. Rules and regulations . A major target of Republican political attacks now is Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the health care reforms passed by Democrats in 2010 and despised by the political right. In her job, Sebelius oversees the setting of regulations and rules under the Affordable Care Act, just like Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Gina McCarthy is considering regulations on greenhouse gas emissions opposed by Republicans. That's what agency and department heads do, and the ending of minority filibusters against a president's nomination will mean faster implementation of an administration's policies. By essentially lubricating the nomination process, the rule change increases the chances of more ""Ping Pong politics"" in the future, with each new administration undoing regulations and policies of predecessors under the opposite party. Man who coined the term 'nuclear option' regrets ever pursuing it . 5. Thorny politics . The Senate rules change applies only to appointments and nominations, not legislation. While some Democrats call for a similar move to apply to proposed laws, such a step remains highly unlikely. However, Republicans warn that the rule change will harm the political relationships between senators of different parties that can lead to bipartisan agreements and cooperation on drafting and passing laws. ""There's still quite a bit of legislation that goes through the United States Senate, and it's done on the basis of people's agreement and work with one another across the aisle,"" McCain told CNN on Thursday. ""There are going to be difficulties from time to time where cooperation was probably the case in the past and will not be now."" With the Republican-controlled House already an opposition bulwark against Obama and Democrats, the President needs the Senate to have any chance to push forward his agenda. What remains unclear is how much the nuclear option will stiffen Senate Republican resolve to join their generally more hardcore House conservative colleagues in efforts to repeal or dismantle Obamacare, prevent immigration reform and other policy stances. ""We're not going to shut down the Senate,"" McCain said, then adding that ""we're going to focus on trying to repair ObamaCare, which is plaguing the lives of millions of Americans.""

"Seventy-four passengers trapped aboard an expedition vessel in the Antarctic for nearly a week will have to wait even longer as a rescue ship slowly makes its way through thick ice and snow. The Australian icebreaker ship Aurora Australis was 11 nautical miles away from the Russian-flagged Akademik Shokalskiy early Monday, according to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. ""It's hard to tell if it makes it through,"" said Lisa Martin, a spokeswoman for AMSA.  ""There are snow showers in the area that are causing bad visibility; conditions are deteriorating."" Visibility was only about  200 meters (656 feet),  not enough to assess whether the ice breaker can cut through. ""It's a wait-and-see operation. It's a very complex situation,"" Martin said. This attempt by the Aurora Australis follows one by the Chinese icebreaker Xue Long, or Snow Dragon, which was just six nautical miles away from the trapped vessel when it couldn't get any closer due to unusually thick ice. The Snow Dragon went back to open water but remains in the area to provide support, said Andrea Hayward-Maher, another spokeswoman for the AMSA. The Chinese ship has a helicopter on board that could assist in evacuation. ""We are waiting on the Aurora Australis to tell us if it can make its way through the ice.  If it can't, then we will be shifting towards the helicopter, and obviously that is weather dependent,""  Martin said. A French icebreaker was also en route to assist, but AMSA called off that vessel's mission Saturday after it became clear that ship wouldn't get farther than the Chinese boat. Also, the French and Chinese ships can break ice only about 1 meter (3.3 feet) thick, whereas the Australian ship can pierce through floe about 1.35 meters (4.4 feet) thick. ""Some reports say that the ice is at least 2 meters (6.6 feet) deep. It's a possibility that the Aurora Australis might not be able to break through that type of ice,"" Hayward-Maher said. Chipper updates continue . Throughout the week trapped passengers have been giving mostly positive updates via YouTube, greeting family members and telling everyone that they're having a great time. ""It's my birthday today -- it couldn't be a better day to have a birthday with my  80-something new friends,"" one female passenger declared cheerfully while standing on the ice in front of the stranded vessel. ""This afternoon we're gonna have some singing on the ice, which should be fantastic as well,"" another female passenger adds. ""It's absolutely spectacular here; it's like this magical winter wonderland,"" she declares with a smile as she waves her arms to point out the vast expanse of snow and a foggy sky. The group continues to do research and finds activities to stay occupied, but there is growing concern that blizzard conditions could worsen over the coming days, according to expedition leader Chris Turney,  an Australian professor of climate change. Extreme conditions . The rescue icebreakers were battling the planet's coldest environment while trying to reach the Akademik Shokalskiy ship, whose 74 researchers, crew and tourists remained in good condition despite being at a frozen standstill since last Monday. ""The vessel is fine, it's safe and everyone on board is very well,"" Turney said. ""Morale is really high."" The ship got stuck in the ice 15 days after setting out on the second leg of its research trip. According to Turney, a professor at the University of New South Wales, the ship was surrounded by ice up to nearly 10 feet (3 meters) thick. It was about 100 nautical miles east of the French base Dumont D'Urville, about 1,500 nautical miles south of Hobart, Tasmania. On Christmas morning, the ship sent a satellite distress signal after conditions failed to clear. The crew had a ""great Christmas"" despite their situation, Turney told CNN. He said crew members have used the delay to get more work done. ""We've just kept the team busy,"" he said. The expedition is trying to update scientific measurements taken by an Australian expedition led by Douglas Mawson that set out in 1911. The expedition to gauge the effects of climate change on the region began November 27. The second and current leg of the trip  started December 8 and was scheduled to conclude with a return to New Zealand on January 4. Turney said the ship should still be back in New Zealand on time.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Prosecutors likely would have sought the death penalty against a researcher who killed himself after learning he was going to be charged in the 2001 anthrax killings, two sources told CNN on Friday. Former U.S. Army researcher Bruce Ivins was found unconscious in his Frederick, Maryland, home on Sunday. Three sources familiar with the investigation said the case soon will be closed because a threat no longer exists. No information has been made public about what charges were planned. Authorities had been investigating Bruce Ivins, 62, a former researcher at the Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, a bioweapons laboratory at Fort Detrick, Maryland, according to the sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is still officially open. Ivins had been working at Fort Detrick trying to develop a vaccine against the deadly anthrax toxin. A U.S. official with knowledge of the investigation told CNN on Friday that authorities were looking at whether Ivins released anthrax as a way to test his vaccine. A spokesman for Maryland's medical examiner told CNN Friday the official cause of Ivins' death on Tuesday was suicide. One of CNN's sources said Ivins knew he was about to be charged. The medical examiner's spokesman said he could not confirm a report in the Los Angeles Times that Ivins had taken Tylenol mixed with codeine. The Times first reported Ivins' death on its Web site early Friday.  Watch what's known so far about case against Ivins » . Ivins' attorney said Friday his client was innocent of the anthrax deaths, and said he is disappointed that he ""will not have the opportunity to defend his good name."" In a written statement, attorney Paul Kemp said his firm had represented Ivins for more than a year. ""The relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways on different people, as has already been seen in this investigation. In Dr. Ivins' case, it led to his untimely death. We ask that the media respect the privacy of his family, and allow them to grieve."" The anthrax mailings, which killed five people, shook the nation just weeks after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. There have been no arrests in the case, which started after someone sent letters laced with spores of deadly anthrax to congressional offices and several news organizations. Among those who died were two postal workers. Two contaminated letters were sent to senators, exposing 30 staffers. Read more on the health risks of anthrax . A spokesman for the Frederick County, Maryland, Fire and Rescue Service told CNN that someone called the 911 center at 1:08 a.m. Sunday to report an unconscious person at a home at 622 Military Road. Frederick Police Capt. Kevin Grubb said Ivins was found unresponsive on the floor of a bathroom. He was taken to Frederick Memorial Hospital. Ivins' modest two-story home is located across from Fort Detrick. Court documents show that a judge issued a restraining order against Ivins on July 24, days before his suicide. A woman sought the order against ""Dr. Bruce Edward Ivins,"" whom she accused of making threats of violence, harassment and stalking in the previous 30 days. In the order, Ivins is told not to contact the woman -- whom CNN is not identifying -- by telephone or other means, and to stay away from her place of employment. A hearing on the order had been scheduled for Thursday, and according to court documents, she had been subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury in Washington on Friday. John Ezzell, former chief of special pathogens at Fort Detrick, said he was involved in hiring Ivins, who worked at the facility for years before retiring in 2006. He declined to describe Ivins' exact job responsibilities, but said, ""He was an interesting character."" Ezzell said Ivins was the one who examined an anthrax-laced letter that was sent to Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, in November 2001. The envelope, which was opened in the lab, contained 23,000 anthrax spores and was postmarked October 9 in Trenton, New Jersey. Ivins' brother, Tom, said the FBI questioned him about his brother about a year and a half ago. Investigators ""asked you about your personal life, how you got along with your brothers when you grew up,"" he said.  Watch as Tom Ivins talks about his brother » . ""They said they were investigating him when they talked to me,"" said Tom Ivins, who said he was not close to his brother and never spoke to him about the anthrax investigation. ""I stay away from him,"" he said. An FBI spokeswoman declined to comment about Ivins on Friday. A Justice Department spokesman could not be reached for comment. The FBI had traced the anthrax used in the attacks to the lab, the U.S. Army Medical Institute of Infectious Diseases, one of CNN's sources said. CNN has been told by a source familiar with the investigation that new technology helped in the breakthrough. A separate source, a U.S. official familiar with the investigation, told CNN that a genetic technology aided in the investigation and identification of the anthrax used in the attacks and led investigators back to the Ft. Detrick lab. Fort Detrick issued a statement mourning the death of Ivins, who worked at the U.S. Army Medical Institute of Infectious Diseases for more than 35 years as a civilian microbiologist. ""In addition to his long and faithful government service, Bruce contributed to our community as a Red Cross volunteer with the Frederick County chapter. We will miss him very much,"" the statement said. Ivins had been questioned previously by the FBI, as had many scientists assisting the FBI, the source said. Investigators believed the culprit might be a scientist because of the amount of knowledge needed to process the anthrax. FBI Director Robert Mueller told CNN in July that ""there have been breakthroughs"" in the investigation and he was confident it would be resolved.  Watch Mueller discuss ""breakthroughs"" in anthrax case » . ""We've made great progress in the investigation and it's in no way dormant,"" Mueller said. ""I'm confident in the course of the investigation, I'm confident of the steps that have been taken in the course of the investigation, and I'm confident that it will be resolved."" Early in the investigation, Attorney General John Ashcroft publicly identified a ""person of interest"" in the anthrax case -- Steven Hatfill, a former civilian researcher on anthrax. Hatfill and Ivins both worked at the bioweapons lab at Fort Detrick. Hatfill was not charged and strongly denied involvement. He sued the Justice Department, claiming his privacy rights were violated when his name was leaked to the media in connection with the ongoing federal investigation into the biological attacks.

"Come the end of Sunday, one lucky golfer will go home at least $10 million richer. That same man may also pocket another cool $1.44 million, depending on whether he manages to win the PGA Tour's season-ending Tour Championship. Some $8 million will be on offer to the elite 30-man field at Atlanta's East Lake course, and a handful of those players will be hoping to grab the bumper jackpot bonus for being top of the FedEx Cup playoffs standings. Brandt Snedeker did so last year, taking home $12.5 million from the final four tournaments after winning the decider. The U.S. circuit can potentially make instant millionaires at 34 of its sanctioned events -- 35 if you count the $990,000 on offer to the winner of the Tampa Bay Championship. But it was not always so and prize purses have come a long way in the past two decades -- especially since the advent of a certain Tiger Woods.. ""The tour when I started in 1956 was for about $650,000 total purse for 40 tournaments,"" recalls Billy Casper, one of professional golf's pioneers -- a man who was something of an unsung hero compared to the well-marketed ""big three"" of Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player. ""It started growing in '58 and we grew along with it,"" Casper told CNN. ""It took Palmer about 12 years to become a millionaire. I was the second millionaire and it took me 14 years."" Now 82, Casper can look back on a 45-year playing career in which he won three major titles and 51 PGA Tour events -- putting him seventh on the U.S circuit's all-time list. But it says something about the development of the game that the most money he ever won came in his final victory on the seniors' Champions Tour -- a $60,000 first prize. ""I played about 45 years and I won $7 million. If I'd played 45 years from, say, 1960 on I'd have made a couple of hundred million."" In order to start out as a professional, Casper had to go into considerable debt, borrowing $15,000. ""I had no money to start with, my wife had no money. I had a three-year contract and at the end of three years I paid back the people who'd advanced me the money and gave them a large percentage (reportedly 30%) of what I won,"" he says. ""I had a small sum in the bank, a little house and I owned a '57 Cadillac and I was on my way."" Known as ""Buffalo Bill"" due to a strict diet of organic meat and vegetables that slimmed him down to a more athletic figure, Casper set about his golf career with the discipline he had learned in a four-year stint in the U.S. navy. ""It was really a different time of training and building one's life. There wasn't a lot of money available. You had to stay with it,"" he says. ""I approached golf tournaments the same way -- I was never worried about majors, I just wanted to play the best I could each week. I wasn't like Nicklaus -- he geared himself to winning majors and he played for the majors. I wanted to play every week. I always played for my family."" A devoted family man and devout Mormon, Casper says he still has a ""close relationship"" with the military. In the 1960s he visited U.S. troops (""hitting golf balls off aircraft carriers"") at bases in Vietnam, Thailand and Japan. Even now, he is giving back to the armed forces through his charity work -- in the past three years Casper's golf facility operations company has helped raise more than $1.1 million for the Wounded Warrior veterans project via the ""World's Largest Golf Outing"" event. Last month's staging, held at 110 of the 150 courses run by Billy Casper Golf -- the largest domestic operator in the U.S. -- brought in $725,000. Casper says the abolition of conscription in the early 1970s has led to some of the United States' present social problems. ""There was a time when it was mandatory, they had a draft. Young people spent a certain amount of time in the military and it gave them a wonderful base to launch their lives by,"" he says. ""They got their feet on the ground, they understood what life was all about and they could make a decision as to what they wanted to do -- stay in the military or get out and follow something else. ""When that was abolished, that's when we started having problems with our young people. I think it was a wonderful program and it helped young people to build their talents, skills and abilities to go into society and be productive and carry on for their lives and education. I think we missed a lot when that was stopped."" While golfers these days earn massive amounts of money, they also give a lot back -- this year the PGA Tour's total charitable donations have reached almost $2 billion, dating back to 1938. Everyone from world No. 1 Woods to your average tour pro seems to have a cause celebre, and Casper believes they are a breed apart from their fellow athletes in other sports. ""Most of them do a lot of charity work. I had my own tournament for 22 years and we've given over $3 million to kids,"" he says. ""Everybody seems to have something they're involved in -- they're raising funds and they're grateful for the life they're leading and they're willing to share what they earn. ""Other sports are nowhere near as close to this. I think it's a top class of people who play the game. They have the chance to be involved with all the big companies and are very interested in helping people."" Despite the recent years of economic hardship, Casper says his company has actually grown -- taking over struggling public courses in 24 states and turning them around. ""Everybody is having problems right now and they're looking for ways to keep afloat,"" he says. ""There are a lot of courses that have gone to grass, they've shut down."" Casper says the secret to his business success is down to traditional values. ""We run our courses as if we are dealing with family -- all of our clients and clientele we deal with like they're family. When you deal with people that are family you deal differently than if you're in business,"" he says. ""We develop this wonderful relationship that if you come to one of our courses then you feel wanted and you want to come back."" Casper, who has achieved so much for so long, hopes that he can continue ""to be of service to my fellow beings through the game of golf."" ""Recently I gave a lecture and a gentleman came to me and asked how I'd like to be remembered. I'd never been asked that before, so I thought for a few seconds, and I said I want to be remembered that I had a great love for my fellow man.""","This weekend the winner of the PGA Tour's lucrative playoffs will be crowned .

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- The largest agency in the fight against worldwide hunger is increasing its efforts to assist millions of people affected by famine and drought in the Horn of Africa. On Tuesday, the World Food Programme began a series of nine airlifts to Mombasa, Kenya, according to a statement from the WFP. The total deliveries will bring enough ""high-energy biscuits,"" to feed 1.6 million people for a day. On Monday evening, a cargo aircraft landed in Nairobi with ,""Plumpy Sup,"" a high nutrient substance designed to feed malnourished children under age five, according to WFP officials. Over the next two months, the agency is working to deliver a ""super cereal to Somalia,"" the WFP statement said. The corn and soya-based blended food is fortified with essential micro-nutrients, dried milk powder, sugar and fat that is used for moderately malnourished children from six to 23 months. About 100,000 Somalis have flocked to Mogadishu in search of food and potable water, which have disappeared in a devastating famine and drought, according to the U.N. They join more than 370,000 internal refugees already in the capital in war-torn southern Somalia, many of whom also face hunger. Online donations to the organization have surpassed $3 million, according to the WFP statement, but the financial goal for efforts to help refugees in the Horn of Africa remains $250 million short of current needs. The agency is working to deliver at least 14,000 metric tons (more than 15,000 U.S. tons) of energy and nutrient rich resources to help feed starving refugees in region. The U.N. declared famine in five areas of southern Somalia in June, including Mogadishu. In all, about 12 million people in the Horn of Africa region need assistance. Somalia is the worst hit. Each year, according the WFP, the agency feeds more than 90 million people in more than 70 countries.","The World Food Programme quickens aid delivery to starving refugees in African region .

"Irbil, Iraq (CNN) -- The offensive by ISIS militants against civilians and religious minorities in the northern Iraqi governorate of Nineveh has created a catastrophe. At least 300,000 Yazidis and 100,000 Christians were displaced literally overnight, according to figures provided by the Kurdistan regional government. Many of the Yazidis fled to the mountains on August 3 after Kurdish fighting forces known as Peshmerga, who were protecting them, precipitously withdrew. For the Christians in villages north of Irbil, the moment came in the wee hours of August 7, when the Peshmerga silently pulled out. The thousands of Yazidis who had remained stranded on a mountain seem to be getting out for now after U.S. airstrikes helped clear a safe path for escape. But even if they reach a safer place in Iraqi Kurdistan, their longer-term prospects are grim as long as forces of ISIS, which refers to itself as the Islamic State, control the area where they lived. On August 6, I visited a Yazidi village south of Duhuk -- a magnet for 60,000 to 70,000 of the fleeing Yazidis. They had bread and water but not much else. Many more -- upward of 150,000 -- were on the rugged mountains a dozen or so kilometers north of Sinjar. They found little sustenance or shelter amid the mountains' sparse vegetation and summer temperatures of up to 120 degrees Fahrenheit. Perhaps 40,000 managed to escape on the northern side that day before ISIS surrounded the mountains. Over the following days, a few thousand more trickled out in small groups, braving ISIS snipers as they made their way north. The latest U.N. field reports say an average of more than 10,000 people a day have been crossing from Syria into the Kurdish region of Iraq by a small bridge at Peshkhabour. Most are Yazidis, who had managed to make it down from the mountains and into Syria, about 20 kilometers (about 12 miles) away. Arab neighbors joined ISIS slaughter, escaped Yazidi says . The Yazidis are ethnically related to Kurds but practice a 4,000-year-old religion. ISIS -- indeed many Muslims -- consider them to be ""devil worshippers,"" and the militants seem intent on eliminating them as a religious community and culture. Who are the Yazidis, and why does ISIS want to kill them? Indeed, Yazidis were the target of what was probably the worst attack against civilians in Iraq since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003. On August 14, 2007, four simultaneous bombings involving a fuel tanker and three cars killed upward of 500 Yazidis, wounded more than 1,500 and destroyed nearly 400 homes. The explosions were so huge that no trace could be found of dozens of people closest to the explosions. There was no Iraqi government investigation. No group claimed responsibility, but it was typical of bombings by the Islamic State of Iraq, predecessor to ISIS, which had reportedly distributed leaflets in the area shortly beforehand denouncing Yazidis as ""infidels."" The ISIS strategy since capturing Iraq's second-largest city, Mosul, a month ago is apparently to clear Nineveh -- home to many of Iraq's religious minorities -- of civilians and anyone who isn't a Sunni Muslim. An ISIS photo spread distributed shortly after the capture of the Yazidi village of Sinjar showed the militants executing people who were clearly civilians. Fast facts on ISIS . At least a dozen Yazidi men told me in the past week that ISIS had abducted scores of women and girls, detaining large numbers in a school in Tal Afar, a town northwest of Mosul. Others were trucked across the Syrian border to a detention center. Asad, a young Yazidi man working in Irbil at the time of the attack, said ISIS abducted 50 members of his extended family as they tried to escape and forced them to drive across the Syrian border. His brother Raad drove one of the cars, his cell phone open on his lap, on speaker, while Asad in Irbil kept adding funds from scratch cards to keep the line open. Raad described over four hours the route that ISIS forced the captured family to drive into Syria. ""I lost contact then,"" Asad said. The next day he tried the numbers of another brother. Someone else answered. ""Do not call,"" that person said. ""We have all their mobiles, we don't know where they are,"" and hung up.","Joe Stork: ISIS offensive in northern Iraq a catastrophe for Yazidis and Christians .

"The Winter Olympics is a matter of days away but whether you are using an abacus or calculator the numbers just don't add up. President Vladimir Putin's reputation is on the line and no expense has been spared to stage the Games next month. The 2014 Winter Games will be the most expensive in the history of the Olympics -- $50 billion and rising. Beijing in 2008 cost an estimated $40 billion, though the exact cost is not known. But just what has that $50 billion been spent on? Former deputy prime minister Boris Nemtsov, a fierce critic of Putin, has questioned where $20-30 billion has gone in a report titled ""Winter Olympics in the Sub-Tropics: Corruption and Abuse in Sochi,"" which was published in English in December. Nemtsov, now the leader of the Russian opposition, estimates that that missing money could have paid for ""3,000 high-quality roads, housing for 800,000 people or thousands of ice palaces and soccer fields all over Russia."" The report also says the absence of ""honest competition, cronyism and censorship"" have led to an increase in cost and decrease in the quality of work in preparing for the Games. Dimitry Chernyshenko, president of Sochi's Olympic Organizing Committee, is dismissive of such claims. ""The rest of the money, which sometimes appears in the media, is just imagination and calculation that has nothing to do with the reality,"" he told CNN. In 2007, Putin advised the International Olympic Committee (IOC) that his country would spend $12 billion on the Games. However, Nemtsov's report claimed the final expenditure -- ""given the average world parameters for the increase in costs"" — should have been double that figure. ""The remainder — $26 billion — consists of embezzlement and kickbacks,"" it said. ""It is no secret that the preparation for the Olympics in Russia has been accompanied by unprecedented corruption."" The 17-day event, which begins on February 7, has become a target for Putin's opponents -- who believe the Russian leader is guilty of making the Games into a ""personal project"" as he extensively overhauls a faded seaside resort town that is the focal point of ""Russia's Riviera."" As well as the Winter Games, Sochi will host Russia's first Formula One race in October. ""This is not about sport, this is about triumphing in politics,"" Nemtsov told CNN. ""This is about the strength of power of the Russian president in the world and inside Russia. ""That is why he is responsible for everything, including nature and weather."" Nemtsov's assertion that Putin has tried to control the weather refers to the challenge posed by Sochi's subtropical climate, which has required the storage of snow collected during the previous winter. Both the opening and closing ceremonies will take place close to the Black Sea in an area which was once rife with mosquitos -- even in winter, the daytime temperature on the coast is an average 10C (50F). Chernyshenko, however, remains unruffled by the report's claims. He insists all venues and arenas will be ready for the opening ceremony and the arrival of 6,000 athletes. ""For us as organizers and for Russia as a whole, this is really a once in a lifetime opportunity to take the floor in front of the multi-billion audience,"" he said. ""We have to convince the world, to showcase the new modern Russia to all of the world and say, 'Look we're different to the stereotypes, we are modern, we are transparent, we're efficient and we're successful.'"" What rankles Nemtsov and the co-writer of his report, activist Leonid Martynyuk of the Russian Solidarity movement, is the vast amount of money being spent on the event. According to the report, the exorbitant rise from $12 billion to $50 billion can only be explained by ""banal thievery, corruption and complete lack of professionalism of the contractors."" The report claims the standard of work carried out on venues is of a low quality and is a danger to the environment. It says sewage pipes have burst and the Black Sea has been polluted by construction waste, while the forests have been cut down amid increased spending. These accusations have been strongly denied by Chernyshenko, who says his operational budget is ""very average."" ""To avoid speculation I would point to two budgets, which is following from our contractual obligation from the candidature file, from the bidding campaign,"" he told CNN. ""First of all this is a separate budget to host the Games that I'm in charge of, this is roughly the same as the previous Winter Games organizers, around $2.2 billion. ""Then the construction budget, to build our state-of-the-art venues and related infrastructure, both competition and non-competition venues, and some environment like sewerage system, power system, some connecting roads etc. ""This budget is also very transparent, it's in the governmental program number 991. So you can visit the website and learn your figures yourself. ""It's roughly dependent on currency fluctuation, something around $7 billion dollars, and half of this money is coming from the public fund."" Chernyshenko admitted there has been overspending on the ski jump in the mountain cluster of venues, which has required surgery on more than one occasion. That was explained in part by the ""awful geological conditions"" but Chernyshenko said the structure would be ready in time and the ""expenditure to be balanced."" Putin fired the official responsible for the ski jump; he's since left the country to escape prosecution. However Nemtsov's report did not just highlight the cost incongruities it also criticizes the treatment of migrant workers. It claims 25 people were killed during 40 accidents at Olympic construction sites and says money promised to workers ended up in the pockets of contractors. That led to, in Nemtsov's his opinion, a number of protests, which included local resident Martiros Demerchyan, who was allegedly abused and tortured by police officers after demanding his full wages for work at one of the Olympic construction sites. The report also claims that Roman Kuznetsov, who had taken part in the building of the main media center at the Imeret Lowlands, ""sewed his mouth shut as a sign of protest against the non-payment of wages and demonstrated at the entrance of the media center with several posters."" ""Sometimes they pay them nothing,"" said Nemtsov. ""So for me this is the first indication there is corruption. ""But there are no criminal cases for corruption in preparation for the Olympics -- there's no fraud case. ""There should be an investigation into corruption not just in Russia but I'm sure the International Olympic Committee (IOC) is involved. ""They have immunity like international diplomats and the police will never investigate because they have protection."" The IOC rejected the allegations in a statement given to CNN. It read: ""This looks like pure uninformed speculation. The IOC has shown consistently that when there are tangible allegations we take the appropriate action.""","The 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics is set to be most expensive in history .

"A grand jury in Missouri now has more time decide whether Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson should be charged for the shooting death of teenager Michael Brown. St. Louis County Judge Carolyn Whittington has extended the grand jury's deadline until January 7, said Paul Fox, the county's director of judicial administration. The grand jury will mull testimony and decide whether they believe Wilson committed a crime when he shot Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old, on August 9. So far, police and witnesses have given conflicting narratives on what happened. Outrage over the shooting led to days of protests in Ferguson and a heated debate over whether Brown's race played a role in his death. Brown was black, like two-thirds of his neighbors in Ferguson. Wilson is white, like most of the city's police department. The grand jury, which meets in secrecy, consists of nine white people (six men and three women) and three black people (two women and a man), court officials have said.","A grand jury has until January 7 to decide whether Officer Darren Wilson should be charged .

"(CNN)The deaths of two patients at a Los Angeles hospital are linked to the deadly bacteria CRE and more than 100 other patients may have been exposed to the drug-resistant superbug, a spokeswoman for the UCLA Health System said Wednesday. Roxanne Yamaguchi Moster said in a written statement that seven patients at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center are known to have been infected by carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae, and CRE was a contributing factor in the death of two of them. The hospital is contacting 179 other patients who had endoscopic procedures between October and January. The patients have been offered tests for the aggressive bacteria they can take at home. Moster said two scopes were sterilized to the manufacturer's instructions. ""However, an internal investigation determined that CRE bacteria may have been transmitted during a procedure that uses this specialized scope to diagnose and treat pancreaticobiliary (disorders of the bile ducts, gall bladder or pancreas),"" Moster said. The hospital notified the Los Angeles County and the state of California health departments when it discovered the bacteria. The L.A. County Public Health Department visited the hospital to review procedures. ""No infection control breaches were observed,"" the department said in a statement. Some CRE bacteria can resist most antibiotics, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says on its website. The bacteria can kill up to half of patients who are infected.

"Colorado state Rep. Tony Exum thought he was being punked. The voice on the other end of the line claimed to be Vice President Joe Biden. It said it wanted to underscore the broader national importance of the heated gun control policy debate raging in Colorado. ""He asked me if the gun control laws we were debating had a chance of being passed, and I told him I thought it did. He talked about what gun control laws would mean and the difficulty of getting those passed in the country,"" Exum, a Democrat, said of the call he received from Biden last month. ""At first I thought it was a prank call."" The brief exchange between Exum -- who represents a small section of southeast Colorado Springs where he once responded to shootings as a firefighter -- and the vice president, who heads up the Obama administration's gun control reform efforts, wasn't a chance encounter. Calls to state lawmakers by the vice president are ""unusual,"" but not necessarily a bad thing, said Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research. ""It's clear that the administration has placed gun violence prevention near the top of its agenda,"" Webster said. ""States passing stronger gun laws builds momentum for change in other states and at the federal level. Colorado is an important state not only because it has experienced two of the most high-profile and deadliest mass shootings, but because it is a purple state with a lot of gun owners."" (A shooting at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, last July killed 12 people and injured 58. In April 1999, two students at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, killed 13 and wounded 23 others before killing themselves.) Forget about 'political survival' in gun debate, Biden says . The state battles are important because the administration needs to send a signal back to Washington that the gun laws the White House supports need not have negative political consequences, gun policy experts say. Having the vice president reach out to local lawmakers ""may provide cover for some states that are passing these types laws so that there is some national conversation on this,"" said economist and pro-gun advocate John Lott. In many ways, Colorado is ground zero for states' battles over gun control policy. As the nation awaits congressional action on a slate of gun control measures ranging from an assault weapons ban to expanded background checks, many states have taken matters into their own hands. ""Some very pro-gun states are passing legislation that says, in essence, we won't follow certain federal laws,"" Webster said. From Second Amendment to assault weapons ban: A look at U.S. gun laws . There are more than 1,000 gun policy bills pending in the nation's state legislatures, according to an analysis by the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. The measures run the gamut from assault weapons bans and expanded background checks to proposals allowing guns in schools and in churches. More than half of the nation's state legislatures have had measures introduced that aim to nullify the effect of any federal ban on firearms, assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines, according to data collected by the he National Conference of State Legislatures. For example, on January 21, Mississippi lawmakers introduced nearly a dozen such proposals. All of the measures failed, most of them in committee. Most of these types of proposals hit state legislatures within days of the White House's January announcement of 23 executive actions on gun control and the introduction by California Democrat Sen. Dianne Feinstein of a proposed ban of some assault rifles and semi-automatic weapons. ""The bluest states are being aggressive -- New York with the broadest prohibitions relevant to the mentally ill and lowest maximum ammunition capacity and broadest assault weapon ban,"" Webster said. Biden traveled to a gun policy conference in Connecticut last month in the aftermath of December's Newtown school shootings, to underscore the administration's push for tougher laws as the state considers a broad set of gun control bills. Similar efforts are under way in New Jersey. Gun violence plans: What's in the works . Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley has spent tremendous political capital in his effort to enact several pieces of gun control legislation including stricter handgun purchaser licensing, banning the sale of assault weapons and ammunition-feeding devices with a capacity of more than 10 rounds, and expanded prohibitions for the dangerously mentally ill. Across the country in California, state lawmakers are considering measures that would expand the categories of high-risk people who cannot legally purchase or possess firearms -- including repeat drug and drunk driving offenders and people who violate domestic violence restraining orders. The debate has been especially heated in Colorado, where memories of Aurora and Columbine run deep. On Monday, a small plane flew above the Colorado Capitol building pulling a banner that advised Gov. John Hickenlooper, ""Hick: Do not take our guns."" Opponents packed the Capitol's halls and honked horns in the parking lot. LaPierre says gun owners are ready to 'stand and fight' Inside the statehouse, Mark Kelly -- the husband of former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, the Democratic  congresswoman who was shot while meeting with constituents in Arizona in January 2011 -- stressed the importance of universal background checks. Like Congress, the Colorado state legislature is considering a package of gun control legislation designed to broaden background checks to include private sales and limit the size of ammunition magazines. There are at least seven gun control measures up for a vote before the state Senate by the end of the week that, if passed, could potentially be on the governor's desk by the end of the month. Back in Washington, the fate of several pieces of similar gun policy legislation wending their way through a Senate committee could foreshadow the nature of the upcoming congressional gun control debate. But the politics of all of these measures is tricky and the stakes are high, said Alan Lizotte, dean and professor at the School of Criminal Justice at the State University of New York at Albany. ""Both Democrats and Republicans are in a tough spot on this,"" Lizotte said. The speaker of the Colorado House of Representatives, Mark Ferrandino, a Democrat, says though he too was surprised to receive a call about his state's gun control battle from Biden last week, he understands the stakes. The vice president ""definitely said they were paying attention to all states that were having the debates, including Colorado,"" Ferrandino said. However both he and Exum added that though they appreciated the White House calls, they were already staunch supporters of stricter gun control legislation. ""Our goal is to pass the best policy for Colorado,"" Ferrandino said. ""If the vice president wants to take that and help at the national level, or other legislators want to see if that will help with their state, then we'll gladly talk with them.""","As they await federal action, states are enacting their own gun laws .

"(CNN) -- A Saudi court sentenced a female journalist Saturday to 60 lashes for her work on a controversial Arabic-language TV show that aired an episode in which a man bragged about his sex life, two sources told CNN. The court in Jeddah also imposed a two-year travel ban on Rosanna Al-Yami, according to a Saudi Information Ministry official, who could not be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media. The ban prevents her from traveling outside Saudi Arabia. This official identified Al-Yami as a fixer, who helps journalists obtain stories, and a coordinator for Lebanese Broadcasting Corp., the network that aired ""A Thick Red Line,"" a popular show on social taboos. On one episode, a Saudi man, Mazen Abdul Jawad, bragged about sex and got into trouble with Saudi authorities for his boasts. Abdul Jawad was put on trial and sentenced to five years in prison and 1,000 lashes. Suleiman Al-Jumeii, the attorney who represents Abdul Jawad, also confirmed the sentence against Al-Yami, saying he believes she is the first Saudi journalist ever to be sentenced to lashes. While the charges include involvement in preparing the program, she was not involved in setting up the episode in which Abdul Jawad appeared, the lawyer said. Al-Jumeii doesn't represent Al-Yami, but he said he is keeping tabs on all aspects of cases dealing with ""A Thick Red Line."" The lawyer is attempting to pursue an appeal for his client and get his case heard in a special court that deals only with media matters. CNN has attempted to get comments from Al-Yami and her attorney. Abdul Jawad, a 32-year-old airline employee and divorced father of four, spoke openly about his sexual escapades, his love of sex and losing his virginity at age 14 on ""A Thick Red Line."" That episode caused an uproar in deeply conservative Saudi Arabia, where Shariah, or Islamic law, is practiced. Premarital sex is illegal, and unrelated men and women are not permitted to mingle. Saudi authorities shut down the Lebanese network's offices in Jeddah and Riyadh after the interview aired a few months ago. Abdul Jawad was arrested shortly after the program aired and charged with violating Saudi Arabia's crime of publicizing vice.","Journalist Rosanna Al-Yami works for network that aired show on taboos .

"It's the building block for most of the world's technology, from websites to apps that we use everyday. We're talking about code: an integral part of our lives, but something that most people have no idea about the workings of. Smart Business meets Kathryn Parsons, co-founder of Decoded -- a company that teaches people how to code in just one day. CNN: What spurred you on to launch Decoded? Kathryn Parsons: We started the company with a very simple but challenging mission: could you teach anyone and everyone to code in a single day? Taking someone from zero skills, zero knowledge and zero confidence to these words that we use all the time -- digital enlightenment. CNN: Why is it so important for people to learn to code? KP: Code is the building block of the world around us today. Technology is transforming every single industry all our lives are being rapidly affected by the pace of technological change -- it's the languages of billions now. But how many of us can say that we truly feel confident or empowered by the technologies behind the screen? We all should be understanding and feel confident of those technologies, whether you want to become a programmer and developer or you simply want to lead a business that's being transformed by technology. CNN: Decoded has taught more than 2,000 different businesses how to code. What does the program entail? KP: When somebody comes to a Decoded course, they are asked to do no pre-work; nothing. Everything is prepared for you, usually in a wonderful space because we believe that space is conducive to good learning. We explain the history of how this world evolved, explain all the characters and individuals who created the technologies around us, and then we get you right to the computer. We want to get you coding as soon as possible. Essentially, you build an app in a single day using languages including javascript and HTML, and you get to think like a developer, think like a computer and break down problems. We set you a brief, and ultimately, you solve that problem. CNN: Are there lost causes when it comes to spreading digital enlightenment? KP: The only lost cause when it comes to teaching coding to someone who thinks: ""I'm driving the car: why do i need to understand what's under the bonnet?"" That's something that I used to hear quite a while ago and it does tend to be, if they're asking that question or saying that it probably means that they're leading a business. If you're leading a business at the moment, the one thing that is erratically changing your business right now is technology: in terms of skills, in terms of your consumers, in terms of the marketplace that you exist in. It's not so much that i wash my hands of those people, i just worry about the future and where they might be in three years' time. CNN: What is Decoded's biggest challenge? KP: It's how can you actually condense six months, a year -- even twenty years of knowledge into a very short period of time. But we kind of relish that challenge, and it's always a barometer for us. And the great thing about technology is that when you understand it and feel empowered by it, anything is possible.","Decoded teaches people how to code in just one day .

"Middle-distance runner Caster Semenya carried the South African flag last month in opening ceremonies for the 2012 Olympic Games in London. That was quite a change for the powerhouse runner, who three years ago was scrutinized for issues other than her athletic performance before being cleared to compete. Semenya gained attention in 2009 before the World Championships in Berlin -- not for her athletic prowess, but because some questioned the then-18-year-old's gender. Her masculine appearance had raised concerns and complaints to the International Association of Athletics Federations, the governing body for all international athletic competitions outside the Olympics. Before the World Championships began, the IAAF confirmed Semenya was being tested for gender verification. The concept of gender testing for athletes is not new.  Various methods have been used to assure that men do not compete as women, which would give them an unfair athletic advantage. While both men and women produce testosterone in their bodies, in men it produces more muscle, adding to athletic prowess.  Women use testosterone to produce estrogen, the female hormone. This year, the London Olympic Committee instituted a new testing policy that measures testosterone levels of female athletes, rather than DNA. The testing is performed only if questions are raised about a female athlete's performance, and must be requested by a chief medical officer of a national Olympic committee or a member of the International Olympic Committee's medical commission. While Semenya won the gold medal in the women's 800-meter in 2009, the win was overshadowed by the gender questions, and her competitors complained she should not have been allowed to compete. On September 11, 2009, Australia's Daily Telegraph reported information from ""a source closely involved with the Semenya examinations IAAF testing,""  which revealed that she had both male and female sexual characteristics. Semenya had no womb or ovaries, according to the report, and had undescended testes, causing her to have triple the levels of testosterone of other female athletes. Indian athlete under pressure to prove her gender after accusations . While the politically incorrect term for people who possess both male and female sexual characteristics is hermaphrodite, the proper term is  ""intersex."" The IAAF advised Semenya to get surgery because of the potential health issues caused by her condition. No public information was provided about her treatment. In July 2010, the IAAF cleared Semenya to compete. She took second place in her Olympic debut Wednesday in the 800-meter heats. Commentary: My life as a 'mighty hermaphrodite' Gender testing has been the subject of debate, and different testing methods -- hair patterns, chromosome testing, individual gene testing -- have been used, but no method is perfect. ""There's no simple test to determine gender, so what we're left with is an imperfect system,"" says Dr. Eric Vilain, a UCLA medical geneticist who served as a medical adviser to the IOC on its new policy for testing female athletes for ""hyperandrogenism"" -- meaning producing too many male hormones. Critics of the female ""hyperandrogenism"" testing include professors Rebecca Jordan-Young and Katrina Karkazis of Barnard College and Stanford University, respectively. The two say the ""new sex testing policy threatens to ban women whose bodies produce high levels of testosterone."" They argue in an editorial published in the Guardian that ""faulty logic ... links two common but inaccurate assertions about testosterone."" ""The first is that male and female elite athletes have clear and distinct testosterone levels. ... The IOC then projects this supposed gap onto differences in male and female athletic performance, claiming they 'differ mainly due to the fact that men produce significantly more androgenic hormones than women.'"" Vilain disagrees, saying that ""there's a huge no man's land""  between male and female testosterone levels. He also suggests ""there could be no testing, which has been argued,"" by Jordan-Young and Karkazis, ""but the vast majority of female athletes I have spoken with believe there should be some sort of testing"" when questions are raised about female athletes. Transsexual athletes treated unfairly . The IOC regulations state that ""the performance of male and female athletes may differ mainly due to the fact that men produce significantly more androgenic hormones than women and, therefore, are under stronger influence of such hormones."" Women who are found to have abnormally high levels of androgens may have an unfair advantage, according to the regulations. The IOC also notes, ""Nothing in these regulations is intended to make any determination of sex. Instead these regulations are designed to identify circumstances in which a particular athlete will not be eligible (by reason of hormonal characteristics) to participate in the 2012 Olympic Games"" in the female category. Vilain says he believes it would be ""extraordinarily difficult"" for women to reach the male range threshold for testosterone, which is not spelled out by the IOC because of differing lab testing methods. He says that for the small number of female athletes who learn they have high levels of testosterone, treating the condition, whether it is caused by a disorder of sex development or an adrenal malfunction, will benefit their health.

"(CNN) -- The story has become a cliché when talk turns to young people and the internet: . A young adult posts pictures of a beer-soaked keg stand on Facebook. (In this modern-day parable, it's always a keg stand -- a means of guzzling beer directly from a keg -- and always Facebook.) Potential employer goes online and finds the photo. Young person doesn't get the job. Samantha Abernethy, 26, figures this fictional over-sharer probably doesn't deserve the job. But not for the reason you might think. ""I think the employer is more likely to judge you for not understanding the (Facebook) privacy settings than they are for doing the keg stand,"" said Abernethy, who edits local news sites in Chicago, Illinois. ""If you're concerned about what's out there, you make sure nobody can find you by Googling you."" It's a point that highlights one facet of the digital world's complex set of views about privacy. Often, younger users -- the so-called ""digital natives"" who have roamed the Web for as long as they can remember -- are less worried than older people about their privacy online. But it's not because they don't care about protecting their information. In many cases, experts say, it's because they understand how to control it better than older users. To them, it's easy to pick and choose what to share, how to share it and with whom. ""I don't really see the big deal in it,"" said Adam Britten, 20, a Syracuse University junior currently studying in London. ""We know how to operate the system."" To be sure, concerns about how much personal information can be accessed on the Web are real, as advertisers, social-networking sites and even criminals look for data to use -- and sometimes abuse. But research from Pew Research Center seems to show privacy concerns actually declining as people grow more comfortable with the internet. In a Pew survey released in May, 33 percent of respondents said they were worried about how much information is available about them online. That's down from 40 percent in 2006. Only 30 percent of users between 18-29 said they were worried, the lowest of any age group except for people 65 and older, who may worry less because they don't use the internet much, if at all. Again, Pew notes that not being worried doesn't necessarily mean no desire for privacy. ""It is important to note that the results from this question are not a measure of internet users' overall views on 'privacy' or the extent to which they wish to have control over their personal information online,"" the report reads. ""A relative lack of concern about the availability of personal information online does not necessarily translate into inaction. Indeed, many of the least concerned internet users have still taken steps to restrict what they share with others."" In fact, the youngest internet users were the most likely to have protected themselves on the Web, with 44 percent saying they had taken steps to limit information about themselves. Still, the stereotype exists that sites like Facebook and Twitter are a font of digital data that bad guys use to pilfer personal details. And young folks, the thinking goes, are all too happy to spill their most intimate details. ""It's the end of privacy only if people are stupid enough to post their personal information on sites like Facebook, Myspace, Twitter, and all those other useless social-networking sites,"" one reader posted this week on an article in CNN's digital-privacy series. ""Most of the social-networking stuff is crap. People want to feel important by constantly updating their sites to tell the world what they had for breakfast, what movie is really, really cool, and if they had diarrhea last night."" Clay Shirky, a 42-year-old professor of new media at NYU's Interactive Telecommunications Program, compares views like that to another social phenomenon: rock 'n' roll. You know, that noisy fad created by untalented cretins bent on leading the world's youth to hell? Just like some adults didn't get the appeal of Chuck Berry and Jerry Lee Lewis in the '50s and '60s, some don't get Twitter and Foursquare now. ""Whenever young people are allowed to indulge in something old people are not allowed to, it makes us bitter,"" Shirky said in a New York magazine article titled ""Say Everything."" ""What did we have? The mall and the parking lot of the 7-Eleven? It sucked to grow up when we did! And we're mad about it now. ""People are always eager to believe that their behavior is a matter of morality, not chronology, (but) you didn't behave like that because nobody gave you the option."" Researchers say that older users, who have spent most of their lives without social-networking sites, often have to overcome privacy fears in a way that younger users don't. Older users are the fastest-growing segment on sites like Facebook. But many remain mistrustful of such sites, perhaps because of the sometimes-complicated measures that protecting privacy requires. In a CNN article last year, Karen Essman, then 61, said she uses Facebook, but has a hard time convincing friends to join her, in part because they're worried about scams. ""It's a little bit more difficult for older people,"" she said. A survey conducted this spring suggested that much of the backlash over Facebook privacy changes earlier this year came from adults over the age of 35. Alice Marwick, a social-media researcher for Microsoft Research, predicts that the stereotype of young people oversharing online may be starting to fade. ""I think that, a few years ago when this concern was really at a peak, the people who were judging young people for their online information practices weren't really using social media themselves,"" she said. ""As we see more people in their 40s and 50s and 60s get involved ... I think we're going to see much less of this generational schism than we do today."" Marwick is quick to point out, though, that age might not be the best way to judge attitudes, and aptitude, regarding digital privacy. ""Someone's level of education, their access to technology in the home -- those types of things are going to have more of an effect on their comfort level than their age,"" she said. And while many young adults may be among the most savvy internet users, she said research shows that many teens, and even younger Web users, may not always understand online privacy and still sometimes share things without understanding the possible ramifications. Experts say that 20-somethings like Britten and Abernethy are more comfortable with today's internet because they've never known it any other way. So, while a 40-something Web user may feel squeamish about Facebook ads triggered by things they ""like"" or Google programs scanning their e-mails for keywords, 20-somethings consider it par for the course. ""I don't think those are that annoying -- they're just something we have to live with,"" said Britten, who started using message boards and Web chat rooms when he was about 10. ""We're exposed to ads so frequently that I almost don't even see them any more."" Abernethy, who was 2 when her family first got a computer, said she's not bothered by the targeted ads either. At least, not yet. ""Not until they track me down and knock on my door and ask if I want to buy a Snickers.""","Experts: Young adults are less concerned than older adults about privacy online .

"It's another small sliver of information in the expanse of mystery surrounding Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. A failed satellite phone call suggests the missing passenger jet may have turned south slightly earlier than previously thought during its enigmatic journey, Australian authorities said Thursday. After Flight 370 dropped off radar on March 8, Malaysia Airlines ground staff tried to make contact with the plane using a satellite phone, Australian Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss said at a news conference in the Australian capital, Canberra. The attempt was unsuccessful, he said, but subsequent analysis of the failed call has given experts a better idea of the aircraft's position and where it was traveling. The latest analysis of the available data has put a focus on southern parts of the search area in the Indian Ocean, Truss told reporters. MH370 vanished with 239 people on board during a flight that was meant to go from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing. The search operation, described by Australian officials as the largest in history, has so far turned up no debris from the plane. International aviation experts have relied on information from radar and satellites to try to plot the Boeing 777's course, concluding that it went down in a remote part of the southern Indian Ocean, far off Australia's west coast. The experts are sticking to the same vast search zone announced in June, Truss said at the news conference Thursday. But some of the information that the analysts now have suggests that areas of the zone farther to the south may be of ""particular interest,"" he said, noting that the focus of the search continues to be refined as experts keep reviewing the available data. Uncertainty over location of turn . Flight 370 was last detected by radar flying northwest over the sea between Peninsular Malaysia and the Indonesian island of Sumatra. A series of subsequent communications between satellite systems and the errant plane -- known as ""handshakes"" -- determined that at some point, MH370 turned south toward the southern Indian Ocean. It was initially assumed that the southern turn took place at the northwestern tip of Sumatra. But the team of experts has since said there's no conclusive evidence about where the turn to the south took place. To calculate the current search area, they said they took two approaches to the uncertainty surrounding the turn. They analyzed the satellite data using a range of assumed locations for the turn, and also without any assumption of where the turn took place. The final radar detection of MH370, by the Malaysian military, occurred nearly an hour after the plane had veered off its planned course. Three minutes later, a satellite handshake indicated that the plane was still traveling northwest. The unanswered phone call took place 14 minutes after the handshake, according to information previously released by Australian authorities. Just over an hour later, a second handshake suggested that the plane had turned and was heading south or southeast. It's unclear from Truss' comments Thursday how much more clarity the analysts now have on the timing and location of the turn. The crucial question of why the aircraft flew wildly off course also remains unanswered. Without the aircraft's wreckage and flight recorders, investigators are struggling to piece together what happened. How flight attendants keep flying after air disasters . Undersea volcanoes . The search for the remains of the plane and the people on board remains primarily focused on a 60,000-square-kilometer area, roughly the size of West Virginia, in the southern Indian Ocean. An underwater search that will involve three ships is expected to start in the area next month, using a range of sophisticated sonar equipment. The process is expected to take about 12 months, Truss said. Officials hope as much searching as possible can be done in the next few months before weather conditions are likely to deteriorate, he said. Ships have already been mapping the undersea terrain in the isolated swath of ocean to help the searchers. Much of the geography of the area was previously unknown before MH370's disappearance drew attention there. The mapping process has revealed dramatic new challenges for the search teams. The ""remarkable geographic features"" discovered by the surveying include at least two volcanoes and an area where the seafloor drops away from a depth of 600 meters (1,970 feet) to 6,600 meters (21,650 feet) over a short distance, Truss said. ""It would not be safe to put the towed sonar equipment into the water if we didn't have this kind of information about the seabed,"" he said. How long will the search continue? Cost of search to be shared . Truss spoke after meeting with Malaysian Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai and Chinese Vice Transport Minister He Jianzhong. Liow said at the news conference that Malaysia's financial contributions to the search will match Australia's commitment. Australia has estimated a yearlong underwater search will cost $48 million. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau is overseeing the underwater search at Malaysia's request. The majority of the people on board MH370 were Chinese. All countries involved remain ""cautiously optimistic"" that the wreckage of the missing plane will be found, Truss said.

"A federal air marshal fired in 2006 for leaking information about air marshal travel cuts has won a victory before a federal court. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on Friday ordered the case of Robert MacLean returned to a federal board to determine whether MacLean's disclosures deserve whistle-blower protection. ""My smile is so wide it's threatening my ears,"" said Tom Devine, a lawyer with the Government Accountability Project who has represented MacLean. Devine said he is ""chomping at the bit"" to argue that MacLean's leak was in the national interest, saying it may have helped prevent terrorist attacks on the United States. The Transportation Security Administration declined comment, saying it is reviewing the decision. MacLean, now a resident of Ladera Ranch, California, and a storm restoration contractor, said he hopes the decision will eventually lead to his return to the ranks of the Federal Air Marshal Service, which places armed, plain-clothes officers on commercial airplanes. The case began in July of 2003, when MacLean, then based in Las Vegas, tipped off an MSNBC reporter that the TSA was suspending overnight missions just days after air marshals were briefed about a new ""potential plot"" to hijack U.S. airliners. The agency planned the cutback -- which would have kept air marshals off most long-distance flights -- because it was running out of money at the end of the fiscal year. The news caused an immediate uproar on Capitol Hill, with Sen. Charles Schumer, and then-Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and John Kerry, among others, writing letters expressing concerns. The TSA retreated, killing the scheduling cuts before they went into effect. A year later, MacLean appeared on ""NBC Nightly News"" -- in disguise and identified only as ""Federal Air Marshal 'Mike'"" -- to criticize the agency's dress policy, which, he said, made it easier for terrorists to identify the undercover air marshals. But someone from the TSA recognized MacLean's voice and the agency ordered an investigation into MacLean for an ""unauthorized media appearance."" During that investigation, MacLean admitted he leaked the information to the media about the 2003 suspension of long-distance flights. The agency fired MacLean in April of 2006, saying his leak was an unauthorized disclosure of ""Sensitive Security Information,"" or SSI. Supporters argued that MacLean brought to public light a TSA action that violated federal law, which mandates that the agency give priority to flights that present high security risks, specifically mentioning ""nonstop, long distance flights.""  They say the information he gave was factual and that it ultimately protected passengers by changing a flawed policy. MacLean argued the information he disclosed was not Sensitive Security Information, saying the TSA sent the information as a text message on his cell phone, instead of as an encrypted message on his password-protected pager. And it was not labeled SSI. MacLean said his firing was retaliation for his union activities. But the Merit System Protection Board said that even if the scheduling directive was not labeled SSI, deployment information was ""within the definition of SSI.""  MacLean ""admittedly knew that he was not permitted to tell anyone about (air marshal) scheduling, yet he did so anyway, and it could have created a significant security risk,"" the board said. The board said there is ""no direct evidence"" the agency retaliated or discriminated against MacLean for his union activities. On Friday, the appeals court held that MacLean had met the threshold of being eligible for whistle-blower protection. MacLean must now demonstrate that he reasonably believed that his disclosures ""evidenced a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety."" ""Frankly, that's a hearing we would relish because there's little question that his disclosures were worthy,"" said Devine. ""Numerous members of Congress attacked (the travel cuts) as betraying the department's (responsibilities).  The Department of Homeland Security said it was a mistake and canceled the orders less than 48 hours after his disclosure. They only corrected the mistake because of his disclosure."" Devine said the TSA has three options: appeal Friday's decision to the Supreme Court, defend the original case before the Merit System Protection Board or settle with MacLean. If the government takes no action, the case will automatically be returned to the MSPB for a hearing, he said.","Air Marshal Robert MacLean tipped the media off to a cutback in schedules .

"Trapped residents screamed for help from their balconies as flames tore through a senior retirement complex in Quebec last week. Since then, the sound of machines has filled the air as investigators try to thaw the ice-encrusted rubble to search for victims and evidence of what caused the deadly blaze. At least 10 people were killed in the fire, which struck the 52-unit Residence du Havre in L'Isle-Verte, Quebec, early Thursday morning. Police believe 22 others also perished, but they're still searching the scene to find out for sure. ""This is something we could have never imagined,"" Nicole Belanger, who worked in the residence, told Canadian broadcaster CTV. ""The heart of our village is now gone."" Mourners in the tiny town of about 1,500 people gathered for a Mass to honor the victims Sunday. Some carried photos of their loved ones. One woman told CTV her in-laws had died in the fire. ""They just moved in two months ago,"" she said. ""We wanted them to be in a safe place for the winter."" At least 37 of the residents were older than 85, according to government documents obtained by CBC. Many of them had Alzheimer's disease and used wheelchairs or walkers, acting Mayor Ginette Caron told CBC. Nelida Pettigrew, 90, told CBC she left her walker behind, escaping down two flights of stairs to safety after a neighbor pointer her toward the emergency exit. But others didn't make it. ""I saw them. It was horrible, but I'm OK,"" she said. ""I didn't cry then, but I cried after."" Investigators are still trying to determine what caused the blaze. A lit cigarette is one of many possibilities authorities are looking into, but police say they have not ruled anything out as they try and determine a cause. Quebec Premier Pauline Marois told reporters Sunday that the situation was an ""unacceptable"" tragedy, according to CBC, but cautioned that people should avoid speculation about what caused the fire and allow the investigation to run its course. Frigid temperatures have made searching the scene a struggle. Authorities are now using machines normally used to de-ice ships in their efforts to thaw the rubble.","Investigators are searching the scene for victims and evidence .

"As the search for a missing Malaysia Airlines jet entered a sixth day Thursday, investigators remained uncertain about its whereabouts. Here's a summary of what we know and what we don't know about Flight 370, which was carrying 239 people when it disappeared from radar screens over Southeast Asia. THE FLIGHT PATH . What we know: The Boeing 777-200ER took off from Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital, at 12:41 a.m. Saturday (12:41 p.m. Friday ET). It was scheduled to arrive in Beijing at 6:30 a.m. the same day, after a roughly 2,700-mile (4,350-kilometer) journey. But around 1:30 a.m., air traffic controllers in Subang, outside Kuala Lumpur, lost contact with the plane over the sea between Malaysia and Vietnam. What we don't know: What happened next. The pilots did not indicate any problem to the tower, and no distress signal was issued. Malaysian military officials cite radar data as suggesting the plane might have changed course. But the pilots didn't tell air traffic control that they were doing so. Malaysian officials say they are still trying to determine if a radar blip detected heading west soon after the plane lost contact was in fact the missing jet. If it was, the plane would have been hundreds of miles off its original flight path and headed in the wrong direction. Malaysian officials say they have asked U.S. experts to help them analyze the radar data. We don't know why the plane would have turned around. While one expert tells CNN the plane's possible deviation could mean someone deliberately turned the plane around, another expert says power failure could have disrupted the main transponder and its backup, and the plane could have flown for more than an hour. Adding to the puzzle, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that the plane may have kept flying for a further four hours after its last reported contact. The newspaper attributed the information to two unidentified people who were citing data automatically transmitted to the ground from the passenger jet's engines. CNN has so far been unable to confirm the report. 'We have to find the aircraft' THE PASSENGERS . What we know: There were 239 people on board: 227 passengers and 12 crew members. Five of the passengers were younger than 5 years old. Those on board included a number of painters and calligraphers, as well as employees of an American semiconductor company. According to the airline, the passengers' 14 nationalities spanned the Asia-Pacific region, Europe and North America. Passengers from China or Taiwan numbered 154, followed by Malaysians, at 38. There were three U.S. citizens on the plane. Four passengers had valid booking to travel but did not show up for the flight, according to the airline. ""As such, the issue of off-loading unaccompanied baggage did not arise,"" it added Tuesday in a prepared statement. What we don't know: Whether any of the passengers had anything to do with the plane's disappearance. Friends tell of fears as hopes dim for passengers . THE PASSPORT MYSTERY . What we know: Two passengers boarded the plane using stolen passports. Authorities have identified them as Pouri Nourmohammadi, 18, and Delavar Seyed Mohammad Reza, 29, both Iranians. Malaysian police believe Nourmohammadi was trying to emigrate to Germany using the stolen Austrian passport. The men entered Malaysia on February 28 using valid Iranian passports, according to Interpol. The use of the stolen passports had raised concern that the people who used them might be involved in the plane's disappearance. But officials have said they think it is unlikely the Iranian men had links to terrorist groups. Malaysian police said Nourmohammadi's mother contacted them after her son didn't arrive in Frankfurt as expected. ""The more information we get, the more we're inclined to conclude that it was not a terrorist incident,"" Ronald Noble, the secretary general of the international police organization Interpol, said Tuesday. What we don't know: More details about the two men, particularly Reza. Malaysian officials and Interpol also gave slightly different information for Nourmohammadi's name and age. It was unclear what caused the discrepancy. Would-be immigrants have used fake passports to try to enter Western countries in the past. And Southeast Asia is known as a booming market for stolen passports. THE SECURITY SCREENING . What we know: Interpol says the passports were listed as stolen in its database. But they had not been checked from the time they were entered into the database and the time the plane departed. Noble said it was ""clearly of great concern"" that passengers had been able to board an international flight using passports listed as stolen in the agency's database. What we don't know: Whether the passports had been used to travel previously. Interpol says it's ""unable to determine on how many other occasions these passports were used to board flights or cross borders."" Malaysian authorities are investigating the security process at the airport in Kuala Lumpur, but have insisted it meets international standards. How does a jet go missing? THE CREW . What we know: The crew members are Malaysian. The pilot is Capt. Zaharie Ahmad Shah, a 53-year-old veteran with 18,365 flying hours who joined Malaysia Airlines in 1981. The first officer, Fariq Ab Hamid, has 2,763 flying hours. Fariq, 27, started at the airline in 2007. He had been flying another jet and was transitioning to the Boeing 777-200 after having completed training in a flight simulator. What we don't know: What went on in the cockpit around the time the plane lost contact with air traffic controllers. The passenger jet was in what is considered the safest part of a flight, the cruise portion, when it disappeared. The weather conditions were reported to be good. Aviation experts say it's particularly puzzling that the pilots didn't report any kind of problems before contact was lost. THE SEARCH . What we know: Dozens of ships and planes from various countries have been scouring the South China Sea near where the plane was last detected. Debris spotted in the area has turned out to be unrelated to the plane. Similarly, an oil slick in the search area was determined to be from fuel oil typically used in cargo ships, not from the plane. Vietnamese searchers found no trace Thursday of ""suspected floating objects"" detected in Chinese satellite imagery near the plane's last confirmed location. What we don't know: Whether the search is concentrating on the right place. Authorities initially focused their efforts around the mouth of the Gulf of Thailand, near the plane's last known position. But they have expanded efforts westward, off the other coast of the Malay Peninsula, and northward into the Andaman Sea, part of the Indian Ocean. On Wednesday, authorities announced that they'd widened the search area to nearly 27,000 square nautical miles (35,000 square miles). Jet was 'at safest point' in flight . THE CAUSE . What we know: Nothing. ""For the aircraft to go missing just like that ... as far as we are concerned, we are equally puzzled as well,""  Azharuddin Abdul Rahman, director general of the Malaysian Civil Aviation Department, said this week. The aircraft model in question, the Boeing 777-200ER, has an excellent safety record. What we don't know: Until searchers find the plane and its voice and data recorders, it may be difficult to figure out what happened. CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen says the range of possible reasons behind the disappearance can be divided into three categories: mechanical failure, pilot actions and terrorism. But all we have are theories. THE PRECEDENT . What we know: It's rare, but not unprecedented, for a commercial airliner to disappear in midflight. In June 2009, Air France Flight 447 was en route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris when communications ended suddenly from the Airbus A330, another state-of-the-art aircraft, with 228 people on board. It took five days to locate the first piece of debris from that plane -- and nearly two years to find the bulk of Flight 447's wreckage and most of the bodies in a mountain range deep in the Atlantic Ocean. It took even longer to establish the cause of the disaster. What we don't know: Whether what happened to the missing Malaysia Airlines plane is similar to what happened to the Air France flight. Investigators attributed the Flight 447 crash to a series of errors by the pilots and their failure to react effectively to technical problems.

"COLUMBUS, Ohio (CNN) -- The Web site of the Ohio secretary of state was back up and running Tuesday, a day after officials pulled the site partially offline when it was hacked by unknown outsiders. Ohio Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner says her office has received death threats. Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner told CNN that ""fortunately"" no sensitive material was breached in the incident. ""We found it in time that we were able to mitigate any problems,"" she said. However, Brunner said it wasn't the first time her office, which has been embroiled in an ongoing dispute with the state Republican Party over alleged voter registration fraud, has been targeted and that death threats have been part of the package. ""There's been a concerted effort to barrage the office with e-mails and phone calls,"" she said, ""not just to our elections division but to business services division. My employees have been real troopers here. ""The First Amendment is alive and well in the United States, and you know that, and they're not coming just from Ohio. A lot of times, they're coming from other states. But this is all part of the process. And my employees are doing a fantastic job of staying focused on what they need to do."" Brunner said the Ohio Highway Patrol is investigating the hack, the calls and e-mails, as well as a suspicious package with a message that said ""Death to Obama supporters"" and an unidentified powder. That package, addressed to an old office building, was delivered by her office by mail last week, she said. The secretary attributed the troubles to the ""contentious nature"" of the litigation begun by the Ohio Republican Party. Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court blocked a lower court order directing Brunner -- a Democrat -- to update the state's voter registration database after information provided by some newly registered voters did not match up with Social Security and driver registration numbers. The state Republican Party had asked for enforcement of a temporary restraining order, but the justices, in an unsigned order, denied that request. Brunner and other elections officials had appealed an earlier ruling from the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati siding with the state GOP. The state Republican Party contends that there is widespread voter fraud in Ohio, considered by many to be a crucial battleground state for the 2008 presidential election. Officials also allege Brunner ""turned off"" its process for verifying voter registrations while allowing Ohioans to cast ballots on the same day they registered. State GOP Chairman Bob Bennett has accused Brunner of concealing fraudulent voter registrations in hopes of swinging the state to Sen. Barack Obama, the Democratic presidential candidate. Voter registration fraud involves submitting registration forms for people not eligible to vote, and rarely turns into the more serious crime of voter fraud, in which people knowingly vote illegally in an attempt to defraud the election system. Most voter registration fraud cases involve registrars, hired by non-profit organizations to register people to vote, who submit forms they filled out themselves rather than collected from actual potential voters, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. Cases of actual voter fraud are themselves extremely rare, the center said. Republican Party officials are challenging voter registration in several swing states in this election cycle, prompting charges from some Democrats that the GOP is attempting to suppress the Democratic vote. Similar charges were leveled in 2004 when George W. Bush narrowly defeated John Kerry in Ohio to secure a second term, but the Department of Justice failed to uncover any evidence of intentional vote suppression. CNN's Mary Snow contributed to this report.","Hackers target Ohio secretary of state's Web site .

"Militants, including a female suicide bomber, attacked a university bus carrying women in southwestern Pakistan and then struck a hospital where the survivors were taken for treatment, authorities said Saturday. The militants laid siege to the Bolan medical complex in Quetta, holding hundreds of patients, physicians and nurses hostage as they battled security forces, authorities said. An intelligence official, who requested anonymity since he was not authorized to speak to media, told CNN a female suicide bomber carried out the bus attack. Twenty-eight people, including four militants, were killed in the siege at the hospital. The gunmen killed four security force members, a medical administrator, and the deputy commissioner of Quetta. Four nurses died in the crossfire, police said. Two militants blew themselves up, and two more died in a shootout, authorities said. Among the hospital patients were more than 20 people wounded in the university bus explosion, which killed at least 14 women, Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan said. Several others were wounded in another blast tphat struck near the hospital's emergency room as the bus bombing victims were rushed in. ""All the (bus) victims are women teachers and students,"" said Mir Zubair Mehmood, a police official in Quetta. The blast shattered the windows of offices and classrooms inside Sardar Bahadur Khan Women University. The university bus was parked at the school on the outskirts of Quetta, the capital of Balochistan province in southwestern Pakistan. There was no immediate claim of responsibility. But Pervez Rasheed, the country's information minister, said, ""We do not think there is any foreign involvement in these attacks -- this looks like homegrown terrorists."" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemned the attacks, saying ""violence against women and educators has increased in recent years. The aim being to keep girls from attaining a basic right to education."" Ban called on Pakistan's new leader, Nawaz Sharif, to do ""all possible to bring the perpetrators to justice."" On Sunday, gunmen killed two polio workers who were making home visits in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in northwestern Pakistan, police said. Sharif called the attack ""cowardly and inhumane."" Earlier Saturday, assailants bombed the home of Pakistani founding father Muhammad Ali Jinnah in Balochistan, killing a police officer and wounding an employee, authorities said. The attack occurred in Ziarat, one of the country's top tourist spots, about 150 kilometers (93 miles) from Quetta. Jinnah spent the last days of his life at the home.

"Imlil, Morocco (CNN)The Atlas Mountains have long been home to some of North Africa's most remote villages. Until a decade ago, running water and electricity were nearly unheard of, and even today are considered luxuries in most of the mountain towns. The local Berber that populate the villages measure distances by hours and days -- the amount of time it usually takes to travel between destinations. Because there aren't any local shops, villagers rely on traveling markets to obtain goods. Many of the vendors still rely on ancient techniques. ""Our grandmothers were making carpets before us. The best carpets in the world can be found in Morocco. It's an art,"" says Fatima Imerhan, a local carpet weaver. Many locals cite the tranquility that life in the Atlas Mountains has to offer as an asset. ""It's better than a city because in cities there's a lot of noise, cars, and pollution.  But here it's nice because it's quiet, (and there's) fresh air,"" says resident Rachid Souktan. This is a sentiment that is increasingly reflected worldwide, as tourists have started to arrive in increasing numbers in recent years. The majority trek out to Imlil, which has become a kicking off point for skiers and mountain climbers alike. Kasbah Du Toubkal, the village's first hotel, opened its doors in 1995. Kasbah started its life as a colonial mansion, but later fell into ruin. ""There was nothing at the Kasbah before. It was completely abandoned and mostly destroyed,"" says Omar Ait Bahmed, the hotel's manager and part-owner. Since, it has attracted some high-profile travelers, including Martin Scorsese, who shot parts of his film ""Kundum"" in the hotel in 1997. Unfortunately, tourism doesn't just bring revenue to the region, it also brings problems. Since becoming a travel hotspot the local river has become more polluted and trekkers have complained of garbage strewn along the path to the Mount Toubkal. The hotel is doing its bit to protect the local environment, using solar panels and charging guests a 5% tax that goes into local cleanup efforts. Ait Bahmed's partner, Mike McHugo, worries it may not be enough. ""(The villagers) have to be very aware that development doesn't destroy their rich culture. And that's one of the reasons tourists come here.  So they also have to understand that they mustn't spoil the environment, both physical environment and cultural environment, otherwise you'll spoil the goose that lays the golden egg,"" he says.

"It's too easy to let New Mexico off as simply ""The Land of Enchantment."" It's true the state has magical desert vistas, Rocky Mountain playgrounds and charming adobe communities that predate Columbus' arrival by a few thousand years. But there's an undeniably eclectic and occasionally dark side to the 47th state as well. In Roswell, residents see UFOs with frightening regularity. In Santa Fe, they burn Zozobra, or ""Old Man Gloom,"" at the stake every fall. And Trinity Site, near Alamogordo, is the first spot on the planet where humans detonated an atomic bomb. Considering that New Mexico is essentially a bilingual state, where about one-third of families speak Spanish (some villagers in the northern mountains speak a dialect of 16th-century Spanish), New Mexico often feels like a foreign country. Add the interesting juxtaposition that it's the fifth-largest state (121,589 square miles), but has a population of about 2 million people (about half the population of Los Angeles), making it one of the least densely populated states in the country. All of which means that there is quite a lot of space to explore. You might be surprised by what you find. 1. Christmas is served 365 days per year. Walk into any New Mexico restaurant, order an enchilada or burrito and the waitress will ask the inevitable: Red, green, or Christmas? That's local parlance for ""How do you prefer your chile?"" The spicy, capsaicin-rich sauce made from the official state vegetable smothers most everything that comes out of a New Mexico kitchen. Whether you prefer spicy green, mellow red, or ""Christmas,"" a combination of the two, the little-known secret about New Mexico chile is that red and green are one and the same. The difference is how ripe the pepper is when picked. 2. Monks brew beer. Drive about 65 miles northwest of Santa Fe on U.S. 84, past Pedernal, the iconic flat-topped peak painted by Georgia O'Keeffe, and Ghost Ranch, where portions of ""The Lone Ranger,"" ""Wyatt Earp"" and ""No Country for Old Men"" were filmed. Then take a left on Forest Service Road 151. At the end of the 13-mile-long road is Monastery of Christ in the Desert's tap room, where you'll find the smooth, cool tang of a classic Belgian ale. The Benedictine monks grow their own hops to brew six of the best beers in the Southwest under the label Abbey Beverage Company. Beware: Tripel Ale has 9.2% alcohol content, and beer is not allowed at vespers. Reserve a free tasting at least 48 hours in advance. 3. The wine industry here is older than California's. It all began in 1629 when Franciscan friar García de Zúñiga and a Capuchín monk named Antonio de Arteaga planted the first wine grapes in the Rio Grande Valley to use for Communion. By 1884 New Mexico was producing almost a million gallons of wine annually. Indian raids in the 19th century and flooding in the early 20th century brought the industry to its knees, until a group of European investors began importing French hybrid vines to New Mexico to grow small boutique wineries. Today, the state has more than 42 wineries that produce more than 700,000 gallons of wine annually. The Gruet family, established French winemakers who moved to New Mexico to run an experimental vineyard in 1984, grow grapes at 4,300 feet. The altitude must work magic. Gruet's sparkling wines are some of the best in the country. Not likely to stop for a sip in New Mexico? Try a Gruet blanc de noir at the Montage Beverly Hills or Blue Smoke in Manhattan. 4. Route 66 crosses itself. Cruise Albuquerque's Central Avenue today and the buildings might be described as faded retro. Flashback to the 1950s and this blacktop strip was the soul of Route 66, the 2,400-mile scenic highway that passed through eight states along the way from Chicago to Los Angeles. At the height of ""The Mother Road's"" popularity in 1955, 98 motels lined Central Avenue. Today one of the strangest corners is the intersection of Central Avenue and Fourth Street in downtown Albuquerque. Due to a change in the road's alignment in 1937, this is where historic Route 66 (Fourth Street) intersects with modern Route 66 (Central Avenue). 5. Santa Fe is very high, very old, and contains a miraculous staircase. Quirky and charming, Santa Fe sits at 7,000 feet above sea level, making it the highest state capital in the country. It's also eerily reminiscent of the Old West, especially the downtown plaza's Palace of the Governors, which was built in 1610, more than 300 years before New Mexico became a state. The ""City of Faith"" is also home to a few miracles, like the Loretto Chapel's circular wooden steps. Built by an unidentified man who is said to have shown up at the chapel in 1879 with a donkey and a toolbox, his staircase has two 360-degree turns, no visible means of support and wooden pegs instead of metal nails. Some faithful at the time believed that the mystery man was St. Joseph. 6. It's still the Wild West. Like many villages west of the Mississippi, Cimarron, in the northeast corner of the state, staked its claim as the ""Cowboy Capital of the World."" Buffalo Bill Cody once managed a goat ranch just outside of town and Wyatt Earp, Annie Oakley, and Jesse James stayed at the St. James hotel, famous for being haunted by the men who were murdered there. The outlaw Davy Crockett (a relative of the legendary frontiersman) murdered three Buffalo Soldiers in the bar in 1876. More than a century later, New Mexicans are still allowed to openly carry a gun, no permit required, almost anywhere, including state parks and state and national forests, and restaurants that don't serve hard alcohol. So watch your back. 7. White Sands National Monument isn't your typical sand. We may be getting hung up on a technicality, but the ""sand"" in these 275-square miles of shifting dunes 15 miles west of Alamogordo is actually gypsum crystals. (Most inland sand is made from silica in the form of quartz crystals or coral.) That's not the only reason White Sands is surreal: 93 African oryx were imported from the Kalahari Desert and set free between 1969 and 1977. Today more than 3,000 animals, each weighing up to 450 pounds with horns that average 34 inches, roam the dunes. http://www.nps.gov/whsa/index.htm . 8. Archaeologists have identified more than 25,000 Ancestral Pueblo sites in New Mexico. Arrowheads are unearthed almost everywhere in the state, but for the most complete and mind-boggling perspective of these hunter-gatherers who thrived 10,000 years ago, visit Bandelier National Monument near Los Alamos. The park covers 33,677 acres and centers around Frijoles Canyon, where a mile-long hike takes visitors past petroglyphs and masonry walls built into a cliff face. The Ancestral Puebloans cleared out of Frijoles sometime after 1250, possibly because of drought, deforestation, crop failure, or internal conflict. The reasons are still not known. But to this day their ancestors are scattered across New Mexico in 19 Pueblo communities. One-thousand-year-old Taos Pueblo, a multistory adobe one mile north of Taos, is considered to be the oldest continuously inhabited community in the United States. 9. You don't need lightning to be awed by ""The Lightning Field."" In daylight the famous outdoor sculpture built in 1977 by Walter De Maria, appears to be little more than 400 stainless steel poles sticking out of the ground. But come sunset on a stormy mid-July summer evening, the poles will provoke pyrotechnics that make hairs stand on end. Even without lightning, the high desert sky at sunrise and sunset here at 7,200 feet on the edge of the Gila National Forest near Quemado is breathtaking. Make a reservation at least six months in advance to stay in the one rustic, three-bedroom cabin adjacent to the field through the Dia Art Foundation (diaart.org). 10. Ojo Caliente's mineral waters have worked wonders for thousands of years. Ancestors of the native Tewa tribes, 16th-century Spanish colonizers, and ailing bodies in search of a miracle cure have all made the pilgrimage to soak in the geothermal water that flows from an ancient volcanic aquifer to the surface at the rate of more than 100,000 gallons per day. Southwest of Taos, Ojo officially became a ""spa"" 145 years ago, but it still has public Lithia, Iron, Soda, and Arsenic springs. For privacy, rent a brand-new Cliffside Suite with kiva fireplace and a private soaking tub.","Christmas is served 365 days a year in New Mexico .

"A televised confession this week detailing a life of illegal gambling and paid-for sex has capped the dramatic fall from grace of one of China's most high-profile social media celebrities and socialites. Guo Meimei, 23, best known for showing off her wealth, looks and extravagant lifestyle on Sina Weibo, China's version of Twitter, appeared on state television without make up and in orange prison garb after being detained by police last month for operating an illegal gambling den. Guo said that she also made money by working as a call girl. She told police she would charge no less than 100,000 yuan ($17,400) for every encounter. ""I'm really not short of those who want to keep me as mistress,"" she said. ""There are many who would spend money to sleep with me for a night, no matter the price."" Guo's Weibo account, which has almost two million followers, shows pictures of her posing by a jet ski in a bikini, and by a Lamborghini. She was also starring in a film about her life called ""I am Guo Meimei."" Guo invested in the project herself and production began last year. It was careless posts to her followers that tipped off police about her illicit activities. Last month, she was arrested for breaching China's strict gambling laws after boasting about her winnings from betting on World Cup matches. She also admitted operating an illegal gambling venue at a one-room apartment in Beijing with her ex-boyfriend. Guo's startling confession has been splashed over front pages and gossip magazines but critics have warned that her trial by media may be premature, given that she has not yet appeared in court. Some social media users said her case was being used to draw attention away from bad news stories such as an earthquake in southwestern China and a deadly factory explosion. She first gained notoriety in 2011 after she posted photos of herself posing with luxury sports cars and designer bags on a Weibo account that identified her as a commercial general manager for the Chinese Red Cross. Her ostentatious photos sparked widespread outrage about how a charity worker could sustain such a lavish lifestyle, leading to a big drop off in donations the following year, even though the Red Cross denied any connection with Guo. In her confession, Guo apologized to the Red Cross and the public for fabricating her affiliation with the charity. ""Because of my vanity, I've made a very big mistake"", she said. ""I'd like to sincerely apologize to Red Cross, also to the people and especially to those who need to receive help but haven't."" On Monday, the charity called on donors to ""please forget Guo Meimei"" and provide help to people affected by the earthquake in Yunnan that has killed almost 600 people.","Guo Meimei is one of China's most high-profile social media celebrities .

"Calling the NCAA and five of the major athletic conferences a ""cartel,"" an attorney representing four college athletes filed a class-action lawsuit against the NCAA on Monday, saying it was ""illegally restraining competition for the services of players."" In short, college athletes should be paid, according to the landmark antitrust suit filed in a Trenton, New Jersey, federal court. The NCAA compensation cap allows universities to pay their football and basketball players only in the form of tuition, books, room and board and related fees, which Monday's complaint says is akin to a price-fixing agreement. Attorney Jeffrey Kessler, who is no stranger to taking on sports' governing bodies, claims in the lawsuit that the schools are generating ""billions of dollars in revenues each year through the hard work, sweat and sometimes broken bodies of top-tier college football and men's basketball athletes."" ""The reality is that it is already pro sports for everybody but the athletes,"" Kessler said, noting that the sports conferences negotiate lucrative television contracts and sponsorships, and universities shell out big bucks for coaches. In most states, a team coach is the highest paid state employee, the New York-based attorney said. ""What we are saying is that it is fundamentally unfair for there to be rules that prevent athletes who create all of this to receive nothing in return,"" Kessler said. Are times changing? Kessler, who has handled several complex and high-profile antitrust cases, also litigated McNeil v. the National Football League, which led to the establishment of free agency in the NFL, and Brady v. NFL, which ended the 2011 NFL lockout. He also represented players in antitrust actions that led to the present free agency and salary cap systems in the NBA. In Monday's lawsuit, Kessler represents four plaintiffs: Clemson University football player Martin Jenkins, Rutgers University basketball player J.J. Moore, University of California football player Bill Tyndall, who played his senior season in 2013, and University of Texas-El Paso football player Kevin Perry, who also played basketball for the Miners in 2011 and 2012. While only four plaintiffs are named, the class-action proposes representing all Football Bowl Subdivision players and all Division I basketball players. In addition to the NCAA, the lawsuit -- which the National College Players Association is backing -- also targets the so-called ""power conferences"": the Southeastern, Big Ten, Big 12, Pacific-12 and Atlantic Coast. ""Ten years ago this discussion was completely different,"" Players Association President Ramogi Huma said. ""There were a lot of people defending the NCAA system. Fast-forward to today, very few people are defending the NCAA and its practices."" This isn't the former University of California-Los Angeles football player's first foray into the issue. Along with organizing the All Players United wrist tape effort -- which seeks to end a system in which players ""forfeit their rights and endure unnecessary physical, academic and financial risks as a condition of participating in NCAA sports"" -- Huma also founded the College Athlete Players Association. The College Athlete Players Association supported Northwestern University football players' attempts to unionize. The players say they are university employees who are forced to put football first or risk losing free tuition. While Monday's lawsuit aims to end the old notion of amateurism in college sports and reverse NCAA rules that forbid colleges from sharing with their players the billions of dollars made each year via their football and men's basketball programs, the lawsuit does not guarantee salaries or eliminate scholarships. Nor does it call for a trust fund or mention a stipend. It simply would give a university the option of paying the players it wants most. It also calls for individual damages for the player plaintiffs. ""Instead of permitting individual institutions to compete for the services of players who participate in their major college sports businesses, the NCAA and the power conferences act as a cartel in placing a cap on the athletes' compensation,"" Kessler said in a statement. ""These restrictions are a blatant violation of antitrust laws, have no legitimate pro-competitive justification, and it is finally time to bring them to an end."" Value in education . The NCAA contends that athletes are paid in the form of a free education, something that holds a lot of value both immediately and in the future. However, proponents of Monday's lawsuit point out that many student athletes never walk across the stage to get their diploma, and the percentage of Division I football and basketball players who make it to the NFL and NBA drafts is miniscule. In October, the NCAA released a report saying that 82% of Division 1 athletes who entered school in 2006 earned their degrees. The NCAA lauded the graduation rates of two groups of student athletes, those playing for Football Bowl Subdivision teams and African-American Division I men's basketball players, whom the report said graduated at rates of 71% and 68%, both records, according to the NCAA. A September report from the University of South Carolina-based College Sport Research Institute said student athlete graduation rates still hover well below those of the general student bodies. According to its ""adjusted graduation gap"" reports, players in the 10 conferences making up the Football Bowl subdivision -- which includes the five conferences named in Monday's lawsuit -- graduated at a rate 18% below the male student bodies of their schools. For black football players, the rate was 24% below, the report said. The research institute's basketball data from January 2013 also showed wide gaps, with male basketball players graduating at a rate 20% below their male student bodies and female basketball players at a rate 9.2% beneath that of their student bodies. If you consider only the top basketball conference, those rates jump to 30.1% for men and 13.4% for women, according to the institute's findings. Meanwhile, a joint study between Drexel University and Huma's organization found the fair market value of the average collegiate football player is about $120,000. It is $265,000 for the average men's basketball player, the study said. The average scholarship, Huma said, is worth $23,000. ""College athletes, they earn their way through school. This is not a gift. They put their bodies on the line,"" Huma said. ""I believe that amateurism is a myth. This is a multibillion dollar industry. ... We're not against that, but to exclude players from the spoils is un-American. It's illegal, it's inappropriate, and amateurism at this point is being used as a tool to strip the players of their fair market value."" Not everyone thinks paying college players is a good idea. The topic has been debated for years by those within the world of college sport, and paying players has generally been opposed by college presidents, athletic directors and, of course, the NCAA. They all hang their hat on the education argument. At Monday's Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics meeting, former NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said paying athletes would be counterproductive and not in their best interests. Some college athletes play like adults, read like 5th-graders . Does free market apply? But Emmett Gill, a former consultant with the NCAA on academic reform who is now an assistant professor at North Carolina Central University in Durham, said offering compensation could have a positive impact on athletes' educations. ""If students are able to participate in the free market, it will allow us to decide what athletes are there for an education and what athletes are there for a minor league system and allow us to develop programs for each,"" he said. The small percentage of athletes who play on full scholarship in the revenue-generating sports -- football and men's basketball -- could be offered a salary as an incentive to play at a particular school, he said. But the rest of the student athletes, the majority of whom realistically will never be offered cash -- because most aren't even offered full scholarships -- could also benefit from a free market because it would open the door for endorsement deals, Gill said. ""I really do not believe that paying student athletes will have a negative impact on their education,"" Gill said. ""It will have a positive impact."" Huma and Kessler said they believe public opinion is shifting their way. They acknowledge that a few years ago, it would have been less likely to find current players willing to put their names on a lawsuit like this. But as former NCAA basketball player Ed O'Bannon's lawsuit -- which he filed to take back the rights to his own name and likeness from the NCAA -- has moved through the courts, public opinion on the matter of athlete compensation is shifting, they said. In recent years, prominent coaches like the University of South Carolina's football coach, Steve Spurrier, have come out in favor of paying players, while Kessler's legal team even has a convert, Tim Nevius, a former NCAA lead investigator who is now playing for the other side. Whether the sports-loving public is ready to hop aboard the bandwagon is another story. A Marist College Center for Sports Communication poll conducted in 2012 showed that about two-thirds of sports fans, college football fans and college basketball fans concurred that a scholarship for top players was sufficient. But when Seton Hall Sports Poll asked a similar question in 2007, the number was much higher, with 78% of those responding saying college athletes should not be paid salaries.","Attorney calls NCAA, major conferences a ""cartel"" in filing lawsuit to pay athletes .

"Ukraine's acting President called on law enforcement agencies to renew anti-terror measures across the country, citing the discovery of two tortured bodies near the city of Slaviansk. One of the victims was Vladimir Rybak, Oleksandr Turchynov said. Rybak, who recently went missing, was a member of the local parliament and belonged to the President's political party. ""The terrorists who basically have taken the entire Donetsk region hostage have crossed the line with torturing and killing Ukrainian patriots,"" Turchynov said. Such crimes are committed with the support of Russian forces, he charged. But a statement from a pro-Russian leader in Slaviansk rejects the President's claim, and highlights that there is a war of perceptions, too. Vyacheslav Ponomaryov, the de facto mayor of Slaviansk, placed blame for the deaths on far-right Ukrainian nationalist extremists. A pro-government party official told CNN that Rybak's family identified his body at the morgue Tuesday. But the competing claims persist. Biden to Russia: 'Stop supporting men hiding behind masks' As the crisis in Ukraine shows no signs of easing, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden promised support for Ukraine and stressed that the United States won't recognize Russia's annexation of Crimea. ""Ukraine is and must remain one country,"" he said in Kiev on Tuesday at a news conference with Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk. ""No nation has the right to simply grab land from another nation,"" Biden said. ""We will never recognize Russia's illegal occupation of Crimea."" Biden called on Russia to ""stop supporting men hiding behind masks and unmarked uniforms sowing unrest in eastern Ukraine."" He warned of additional sanctions if such ""provocative behavior"" does not end. Ukrainian and U.S. officials say they think Russian special forces are in the region and are behind efforts to seize government buildings and generally promote unrest -- a claim Moscow denies. As well as voicing solidarity with Kiev, Biden promised financial support, assistance in reducing Ukraine's dependence on Russian energy sources and nonlethal aid for security forces. ""You will not walk this road alone. We will walk it with you,"" Biden told Yatsenyuk. As he spoke, the White House announced a $50 million package of assistance to help Ukraine pursue political and economic reform and strengthen its partnership with the United States. Biden said he also expects an International Monetary Fund package for Ukraine to be finalized imminently. The backing is likely to sit well with Ukrainian leaders struggling to keep their country afloat amid dire financial problems, the ongoing showdown with Russia over its annexation of Crimea and alleged interference in Ukraine's pro-Russian east. Tensions remain high as pro-Russian militants show no sign of preparing to leave occupied government buildings in eastern Ukraine despite an international deal agreed to in Geneva, Switzerland, last week. ""As a result of what's going on in Ukraine,"" the United States is deploying Army paratroopers nearby, Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said Tuesday. Four companies of paratroopers based in Italy will be sent to Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia over the next few months for military exercises, he said. Medvedev: Russia can export more to China . But one top Russian official said his country shouldn't be ruffled by talk of increased Western sanctions. Addressing Russia's lower house Tuesday, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said that Russia can shift its economy east, becoming less reliant on the international banking system and selling more oil and gas to China, state media reported. Medvedev acknowledged that the sanctions, coupled with instability in the global economy and domestic economic issues, are having an impact. ""Our decision has provoked a rough reaction. Crimea became a reason for a political pressure, which is carried out on the account of so-called sanctions,"" Medvedev said, according to the state-run RIA Novosti news agency. He said the circumstances should be a foundation for economic reforms. ""We have all of the needed tools to allow us stable development even in these rough conditions,"" Medvedev said. Turchynov: Ukrainians want unity . Turchynov, meanwhile, had strong words for Moscow, saying that ""Ukrainians are ready to protect their country from military aggression of the Russian Federation."" A majority of Ukrainian citizens ""are for a united, democratic Ukraine with greater powers given to the regions,"" he said, referring to constitutional reforms promised in a bid to calm fears in eastern Ukraine. Kiev and Western powers have urged Moscow to use its influence to persuade protesters in the east to lay down their arms, leave the buildings they're occupying and accept amnesty in line with last week's deal. But Turchynov said Tuesday that ""unfortunately, the Russian Federation and its terrorist special forces present in Ukraine are demonstratively not going to implement the Geneva agreement."" He cited the seizure of a police station Monday in the eastern city of Kramatorsk by militants who also took the police chief hostage, ""thereby negating the agreements reached in Geneva."" Moscow has said that it holds no sway over pro-Russian protesters and militants. But Kiev and the United States dispute this. Meanwhile, a statement from the prosecutor general's office in Kiev criticized law enforcement agencies in a number of cities in eastern Ukraine for not resisting pro-Russian protesters as they seized administrative buildings -- even in cases where they outnumbered the militants. The statement says self-defense groups in these places were established in reaction to the failings of the security forces. ""These defense groups have the right to bear arms and promise to guarantee public order in their respective regions,"" it said. Phone calls from Kerry . U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called his Russian counterpart on Tuesday to discuss the situation in eastern Ukraine, the State Department said. Kerry ""expressed deep concern"" to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and said sanctions against Russia would increase in ""the absence of measurable progress"" in implementing the Geneva deal, according to the State Department. Asking Russia to call for those occupying buildings to disarm and stand down, Kerry said there was ""mounting evidence that separatists continue to increase the number of buildings under occupation and take journalists and other civilians captive."" Turchynov's government has talked tough but done little to curb pro-Russian activities in the east, possibly afraid that a crackdown could send Russian forces across the border. At the same time, the occupation of buildings continues in about a dozen towns and cities across eastern Ukraine. In three towns, pro-Russian protesters and militants have made it clear to CNN they have no intention of moving until the ""illegal"" government in Kiev also moves out of official buildings. Moscow also says the government in Kiev, installed after ousted President Viktor Yanukovych fled Ukraine for Russia in February, is illegitimate and backed by far-right extremists. Yanukovych's ouster followed months of street protests prompted by his decision last November to drop a planned EU trade agreement in favor of closer ties with Moscow. Russia annexed Ukraine's autonomous Crimea region last month, following a controversial referendum in which most voters were in favor of joining the Russian Federation.","Kerry warns Lavrov that sanctions could be increased .

"(CNN) -- A passenger aboard Continental Airlines Flight 1404 described a scene of panic as the plane skidded off the runway while trying to take off and caught fire Saturday at Denver International Airport in Colorado. Passenger Gabriel Trejos says he saw an engine on fire as the plane skidded to a halt. ""Everybody was trying to get off the plane,"" passenger Gabriel Trejos told CNN affiliate KUSA. ""Everybody was yelling, 'The plane's going to blow up, the plane's going to blow up!''' Only one of the 38 people taken to hospitals was listed in serious condition and none appeared to be burn victims, said Patrick Hynes, chief of the airport division of the Denver Fire Department. Bone fractures and bruises were the most common complaint, he said. Trejos said when the plane hit the ground, he saw an engine on fire and seats buckling toward each other.

The flight was bound for Houston, Texas, and was taking off at about 6:20 p.m. Firefighters found the Boeing 737 on fire, with its wheels sheared off, resting in a ravine about 200 yards from the runway, Hynes said. ""They described a surreal scene when they pulled up, heavy fire on the right side of the aircraft, all chutes deployed from both sides of the aircraft, people evacuating and walking up the hillside towards them,"" Hynes said. Hynes said the entire right side of the jet was on flames and ""a heck of a firefight"" followed. ""There was significant extension of fire into the cabin portion,"" he said. ""There's significant fire damage inside with the luggage department described as melting and dropping down into the seats."" Hynes said fuel from the aircraft leaked for several hours after the mishap, but the fire was out.

"(CNN) -- The Gulf Coast Claims Facility ""is fully functioning and will begin to process claims for emergency payment,"" a statement from the agency said on Monday, the same day BP reported having paid out $399 million in claims to date. The independent group, headed by attorney Kenneth Feinberg, who handled the 9/11 victims' compensation fund, was established in June as part of an agreement between the Obama administration and BP to facilitate processing of the personal and business claims from those affected by the Gulf oil disaster stemming from the Deepwater Horizon explosion on April 20. BP said last week that it was no longer accepting claims as the transition to the new entity was taking place. The oil giant, which said Monday that it has written 127,000 checks to pay $399 million in claims so far, will continue to handle claims put in by government entities. BP said Monday that 27,000 claimants who filed paperwork have not yet been paid. According to the Gulf Coast Claims Facility statement, claims previously filed with the BP Claims Process have been transitioned to the new claims facility for review, evaluation and determination. However, claimants will be required to file new forms with the Gulf Coast Claims Facility to receive payments. Feinberg, who now controls a $20 billion escrow account established by BP to compensate for damage, said in the statement, ""I want to make sure the people in the Gulf understand we will not let you go out of business or lose your home. The No. 1 priority of the GCCF is to assist the people in the Gulf."" He added, ""Now that the claim centers are open and ready for business, the goal will be to get the emergency six month payment checks out the door, within 48 hours for individuals, after receipt of the claim form and sufficient supporting documentation and no more than seven days for businesses, after receipt of claim form and supporting documentation, and help people on the path to rebuilding their lives."" To date, BP has funded $3 billion of the $20 billion total, ahead of its payment schedule. In a conference call Sunday, Feinberg said he plans to be more generous than any court would be in determining payments. However, he said if potential claimants don't like the offer the Gulf Coast Claims Facility makes, and believe they can do better, they can file suit -- although he doesn't advise it. ""It is not in your interest to tie up you and the courts in years of uncertain, protracted litigation when there is an alternative that has been created,"" he said. Feinberg stresed on Sunday that his facility is independent of both the government and BP. Claimants can file online, by fax, by mail or in person. All 35 of BP's claims offices will remain open, but will be staffed with newly trained workers with the goal of quickly and efficiently answering questions, Feinberg said. On Monday, Feinberg is scheduled to hold three town hall meetings in Mississippi. Each site is also supposed to have people from the fund to help Mississippians file their claims and answer specific questions. The meetings are scheduled for Bay St. Louis, Biloxi, and Pascagoula. Claimants can receive between one and six months' compensation without waiving their right to sue, Feinberg said. Only those who file for and receive a lump-sum payment later in the year will waive their right to litigate. Feinberg said it is still being determined whether those people will be required to release just BP, or other potential defendants, from lawsuits. He said determining eligibility in some cases could be tricky. The farther a person or a business is from the Gulf, the less likely they are to be determined eligible. However, Feinberg said, proximity is only one factor that is being looked at. A shrimp processor located 100 miles inland that solely processes Gulf shrimp would be one example of a case where other factors come into play, he said. ""I don't want to underestimate the importance of proximity to the Gulf, but we'll have to be looking at the nature of your industry and how dependent you are on Gulf resources,"" he said. ""I'm going to have to draw some tough lines, but I'm hoping I'll be able to enjoy the benefit of saying, 'If I haven't found you eligible, no court will find you eligible.'"" BP has done a pretty good job of claims payment in some cases, but has not been very effective in processing business claims, he said. Under his purview, ""they may not always like their answer, but they'll get their answer within seven days."" He said he anticipates ""a flood of early emergency claims"" beginning Monday, but hopes the tide may be lessened by claimants' ability to file and track their claim processing online. He said he plans to be transparent about budgets and payments, even his own compensation. A summary narrative on how adjusters will process claims has already been made public. Asked about Florida Attorney General Bill McCollum's Friday letter to Feinberg criticizing the claims process under the Gulf Coast Claims Facility, Feinberg again emphasized that the program is voluntary. McCollum said the program appears to be less generous to Floridians than the BP claims process, but ""appearances are deceiving, and that is not the case,"" Feinberg said. He encouraged potential claimants to ""test"" the program and see how they will be treated. While Gulf Coast residents are applying for payments onshore, offshore BP has renewed ""fishing operations"" on the sunken, crippled Macondo oil well, BP spokeswoman Catherine Hill said Monday. As a prelude to permanently shutting down the well, crews are trying to withdraw drill pipe hanging below the bottom of the blowout preventer and remove it from the well, so they can then remove the capping stack that's kept oil from leaking since July 15 and replace the old blowout preventer with a new one. Retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen, the government's point man in the region, said BP has determined there are three sections of drill pipe that need to be removed -- a main pipe and two shorter ones. The largest pipe is roughly 3,000 feet long. The government wants to preserve the removed pipe to use for study and possibly as evidence down the road. Development Driller II, the rig drilling a second relief well as a redundancy measure, is completing preparations for its blowout preventer to be used on the Macondo well, while the Development Driller III -- the rig drilling the relief well expected to intercept the main well -- is standing by until that's done. Once the blowout preventer is replaced to mitigate the risk of pressure in the well, it will take about four days to drill through the relief well and intercept the main well, based on statements from Allen. From that point, it will take another few days to permanently seal the well with mud and cement from below in what's called a ""bottom kill"" procedure.","BP says it has paid out $399 million in claims to date .

"Famed boxer Muhammad Ali was admitted to an undisclosed hospital Saturday with pneumonia, his spokesman Bob Gunnell said. Ali's treatment prognosis is good, he said. ""Ali, who suffers from Parkinson's disease, is being treated by his team of doctors and is in stable condition,"" Gunnell said in a statement. The illness was caught early, and Ali, 72, is not expected to be in the hospital long. ""At this time, the Muhammad Ali family respectfully requests privacy,"" the statement said. Ali was born Cassius Clay and won an Olympic gold medal as a light-heavyweight at age 18. In 1964, he became world heavyweight champion in an upset victory against then champion Sonny Liston, according to Ali's official website. Shortly thereafter changed his name to Muhammad Ali to reflect his conversion to Islam. The boxer was also known for his protest against the Vietnam War and refusal to be drafted into service out of religious conviction. He retired from boxing in 1981 and announced his diagnosis with Parkinson's Disease three years later.","Former world heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali has pneumonia .

"Happy National DNA Day! April 25 marks the 60th anniversary of scientists' discovery of the double helix. It's also the 10th anniversary of the completion of the Human Genome Project, which set out to sequence the more than 3 billion letters in our genetic code. Biologist James Watson and physicist Francis Crick realized our DNA molecules form a three-dimensional double helix in 1953. But DNA research dates back to the late 1860s, according to Nature Education. Friedrich Miescher was the first to identify ""nucleic acid"" in our white blood cells; his 1869 finding was later named deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA. Others later defined the components that make up DNA molecules, identified RNA (ribonucleic acid, the other type of nucleic acid found in all cells along with DNA) and determined that although DNA differs in each species, it always maintains certain properties. Those findings led to Watson and Crick's conclusion, which paved the way for decades of DNA discoveries. Today we use DNA tests to tell us about all kinds of things -- from Justin Bieber's baby daddy status to the innocence of a man sitting on death row. But genetic scientists are doing more than trying to prove Bigfoot's existence. Here are five cool things DNA testing can do: . Map your family tree . A $99 DNA test could give you thousands of new relatives (although if they're anything like ours, we're not sure why you'd want them). Sites such as Ancestry.com offer to compare your DNA to those they already have on record in hopes of connecting you to unknown branches of your family tree. Ancestry.com's test can also tell you your genetic ethnicity. ""The new test looks at a massive amount of your DNA ... and compares it to other DNA samples from around the world. By detecting similarities, we can trace back generations to connect you to the lands your ancestors once called home,"" the site states. Solve ancient mysteries . No one knew where Richard III, one of the most famous kings of England, was buried until his remains were discovered in a parking lot in Leicester. The remains showed evidence of battle wounds and scoliosis, but scientists weren't sure the skeleton was Richard III's until DNA extracted from the bones was matched to Michael Ibsen, a direct descendant of the king's sister. It wasn't the first time ancient remains had been identified using DNA. If it's stored in a cold, dry, dark place, DNA can last for thousands of years. In 2009, a DNA analysis of some bone fragments showed two of Czar Nicholas II's children were killed along with the rest of the family during the Russian Revolution, despite speculation they could have escaped. Scientists have even extracted DNA from Neanderthals, who went extinct about 30,000 years ago, in hopes of gaining insight into the evolution of humans. Shakespeare, thou art stored in DNA . Distinguish your mutt . ""Where does Buddy get his curly tail from? Why does he love digging holes in the backyard? Could I be doing more to make him happier and healthier? Your dog may not be able to tell you the answers -- but his DNA can,"" claims one dog DNA site, WisdomPanel.com. You'll probably never figure out why Buddy loves to eat your favorite Italian pumps (other than the fact he's a dog) but you can figure out where he comes from. WisdomPanel.com will test your mutt's DNA against that of more than 190 breeds to determine his genetic background. ""But why?"" cat lovers may be asking. ""When you understand your dog's natural tendencies, you can tailor a training, exercise and nutrition program to his needs,"" the site explains. Predict the future . Using blood from the mother and saliva from the father, scientists can now determine whether a fetus has any chromosomal abnormalities that could cause a genetic disorder. For example, DNA testing can reveal if an unborn baby will have trisomy 21, or Down syndrome. Researchers are beginning to expand the field of prenatal genetic testing even further, using it to identify potential developmental delays and intellectual disabilities such as autism. Genetic testing can also reveal risk factors you may have inherited from your parents, such as a high risk for breast or colon cancer. While this genetic risk factor does not guarantee you will get the disease, it does increase your chances; knowing about the risk may help you take preventive steps. Help you lose weight . A growing body of research suggests that our ability to lose weight -- or gain 10 pounds by simply looking at a piece of chocolate -- is shaped in large part by our genes. Scientists have identified several gene variants that may predispose us, and our children, to obesity. Rodent studies have also shown that up to 80% of body fat is regulated by our genes, according to TIME. That said, we wouldn't search for a customized DNA Diet just yet. While there is a genetic component to obesity, our understanding of it is limited, says CNN diet and fitness expert Dr. Melina Jampolis. Researchers are still trying to figure out how genetics, nutrition and exercise are related so we can help people lose weight and keep it off.","James Watson and Francis Crick discovered the double helix in 1953 .

"As the hours count down to $85 billion in government-wide spending cuts, there's one transportation service that won't be derailed -- Amtrak. Officials of the nation's only long-haul passenger railroad say there will be no cutbacks or changes in its schedule, especially on its popular Northeast Corridor route between Washington, New York and Boston. That's much different than the scenario facing U.S. airlines, which may be forced to alter schedules if federally run air traffic control services are disrupted by spending cuts due to take effect on Friday. Just how is Amtrak able to absorb a hit from the so-called budget sequester? Part of the answer lies in its charter as a for-profit government corporation, which allows it to operate like a business and charge fares and fees. ""Amtrak is planning to take actions to allow it to withstand a funding cut and not cut service. During (fiscal year) 2013, Amtrak is experiencing solid revenue growth and we have been controlling our costs and managing our budget in anticipation of a possible reduction in federal funding,"" said Kimberly Woods, an Amtrak spokeswoman. Congressmen leave as spending cuts loom . However, she acknowledged that the ""continued lack of predictable federal appropriations makes proper budgeting and future planning extremely difficult."" Rail service has been a priority for the Obama administration. While in the Senate, Vice President Joe Biden commuted for years to his home in Delaware on Amtrak and is one of its biggest supporters. The railroad has instituted a number of business reforms over the years, some of them under pressure from Congress, lowered debt, and has been able to make infrastructure improvements to boost operating efficiency. Amtrak carried more than 31 million passengers last year and covers most of its operating costs from passenger revenue. Why Washington can't cut wasteful spending . But it also receives taxpayer help each year. In fiscal year 2012, Amtrak was approved to receive an operating subsidy of $466 million. The remainder of government help for capital improvements and debt service was estimated at $950 million. If Amtrak is going to continue to stay on track, it will have to rely on its money-making short haul routes, where it competes with airlines. Nearly 90 percent of the rail service's ridership since 1997 has been on trips under 400 miles. Along with a 55 percent jump in passengers, it generated a positive operating surplus of $47 million in 2011, according to a new report released by the Brookings Institution. Amtrak has been the fastest-growing domestic transportation mode over the past 15 years, the report said. By the numbers: Congress and fiscal delays . Ten metropolitan areas, mostly on the coasts, account for nearly two-thirds of its ridership. Its signature line, the high-speed Acela, operates in the Northeast and is aimed at premium-paying business travelers. ""The Brookings report shows that Amtrak ridership has been growing faster than any other domestic mode of transportation, faster than GDP, and faster than population growth. These ridership numbers include our long-distance train passengers,"" Steve Kulm, Amtrak spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. Heavily subsidized long-haul routes have long been a target of criticism from Amtrak opponents, especially in Congress. What you need to know about spending cuts . The report on rail travel trends found ridership on long distance routes carry less than 20 percent of system riders and contributed a drag to Amtrak's bottom line to the tune of $614 million. ""We appreciate their suggestion to allow states the flexibility to use their federal surface transportation dollars for rail investments. With regard to how long-distance trains are funded, Congress has determined that these services are vital and a necessary part of America's national transportation system and economy,"" Kulm said. Robert Puentes, a Brookings senior fellow and co-author of the report, said that Amtrak is ""too often considered a big, bloated bureaucracy that depends heavily on federal subsidies and is no longer relevant to the technologically oriented metropolitan economies of today.""

"NATO leaders signed off Monday on President Barack Obama's exit strategy from Afghanistan that calls for an end to combat operations next year and the withdrawal of the U.S.-led international military force by the end of 2014. Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen told reporters at the conclusion of a two-day summit of the alliance leaders that the plan calls for handing over security responsibilities to Afghan forces in 2013, then withdrawing foreign forces the following year. After that, a new and different NATO mission will advise, train and assist the expected 350,000-strong Afghanistan force, Rasmussen said. The plan is backed by Afghan President Hamid Karzai, who sat down Monday to speak exclusively with CNN's Wolf Blitzer. TIME: Obama's Afghanistan problem: the Afghans . ""We have finalized plans so 2014 will be a year in which the United States will not be spending as much money in Afghanistan as it is spending today. It will save money and we will be providing security ourselves,"" he said. ""That transition and the eventual withdrawal in 2014 of the U.S. forces and other NATO forces from Afghanistan is good for Afghanistan and good for our allied countries."" Obama said NATO leaders were leaving Chicago with ""a clear road map"" to bring the war in Afghanistan to a ""responsible end."" ""I don't think that there's ever going to be an optimal point where we say -- this is all done, this is perfect, this is just the way we wanted it and now we can wrap up all our equipment and go home. This is a process, and it's sometimes a messy process, just as it was in Iraq,"" he said. The second day of their two-day summit focused on Afghanistan, with Karzai and the heads of other countries contributing to the U.S.-led International Security Assistance Force also in attendance. Why al-Assad shouldn't worry about NATO . Obama wanted NATO to commit to long-range support for Afghanistan, and Rasmussen said the alliance would support Afghan forces after the combat mission ends. ""Today we reaffirmed our strong commitment to support their training, equipping, financing and capability development in the years to come,"" Rasmussen said, adding it will be a ""new mission with a new role for NATO,"" not ""ISAF with a different name."" Rasmussen confirmed that some NATO members have agreed to contribute money for the $4 billion a year needed to help fund the Afghanistan security forces after the NATO mission ends, but said the summit was never intended to secure that funding. While the Afghanistan force is expected to number 350,000 in 2014, Rasmussen said the size would likely decrease in future years depending on the security situation on the ground and other factors. He also said he expected an agreement soon for Pakistan to reopen its border with Afghanistan to military shipments of departing NATO forces, which would resolve a sticky issue in planning the withdrawal of foreign forces. ""So far, the closure of the transit routes has not had a major impact on our operations,"" Rasmussen said, but added the transit routes were very important and that he expected their reopening ""in the very near future."" Pakistan closed the ground routes after a NATO airstrike in November killed two dozen of its soldiers. NATO insists the incident was an accident. Obama offered his condolences but refused to apologize. The United States and Pakistan have not come to an agreement on the price of reopening the supply lines, according to senior administration officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. Without a deal, officials said Obama would not meet with President Asif Ali Zardari at the summit. However, Obama and Zardari had a brief conversation Monday morning on the sidelines of the NATO session. Zakaria: NATO seeks relevance . The United States and Pakistan are making ""diligent progress"" on the question of reopening the supply routes, the U.S. president said. ""Ultimately it is in our interest to see a successful, stable Pakistan and it is in Pakistan's interests to work with us and the world community to ensure that they themselves are not consumed by extremism that is in their midst,"" Obama told reporters. When asked about turning over security responsibility to Afghan forces next year, Rasmussen denied it was an acceleration of the transition, saying the plan all along was to withdraw troops in 2014 after shifting the lead security role to Afghan forces. ""It has been within our road map right from the outset,"" he said. Asked Monday by Blitzer whether Afghanistan will be ready by 2014 to assume full responsibility for the country's security, Karzai responded: ""Absolutely."" ""We've already worked out a plan to have in six months time 75% of the country taken over, with regard to security by the Afghan security forces ,"" he said. Outside the NATO meeting, protesters marched and rallied on Monday, a day after violent clashes with police. Obama thanked the city's mayor and its police force for their work, which he said was done under ""significant pressure and a lot of scrutiny."" ""This is part of what NATO defends -- is free speech and freedom of assembly,"" he said. Earlier Monday, Obama told the dozens of heads of state in attendance that the goal is to ""responsibly bring this war to an end"" in the next 19 months. He cited a recent strategic partnership agreement he signed with Karzai as a step toward ensuring that ""as Afghans stand up, they will not stand alone."" Full coverage: NATO summit . Obama and Karzai, who met a day ahead of Monday's NATO talks on Afghanistan, both agreed that the end of the war was close. Following their meeting, Obama said the transition of the NATO-led force from a combat role to one of support of Afghan forces paints ""a vision post-2014 in which we have ended our combat role, the Afghan war as we understand it is over."" Karzai reiterated his commitment to the timetable, ""so that Afghanistan is no longer a burden on the shoulder of our friends in the international community, on the shoulders of the United States and our other allies. ""Afghanistan, indeed, Mr. President, as you very rightly put it, is looking forward to an end to this war, and a transformational decade,"" he said.","Afghan President Hamid Karzai speaks exclusively to CNN's Wolf Blitzer .

"The teacher stood in the classroom, face-to-face with his 16-year-old student, who was holding a shotgun. Ryan Heber, 40, talked to the teen, trying to persuade him to end an armed assault in which one student had already been shot. Heber had no idea whether the student -- whose pockets were filled with ammunition -- would put the gun down or pull the trigger. Campus supervisor Kim Fields helped distract the teen, allowing other students in the classroom to escape, while Heber talked to him, according to CNN affiliate KGET. Eventually, the teen let go of the gun, and police took him into custody. That was how police described the frightening situation Thursday at Taft Union High School, about 30 miles outside Bakersfield, California. ""To stand there and face someone that has a shotgun, who's already discharged it and shot a student, speaks volumes for these two young men and what they may have prevented,"" Kern County Sheriff Donny Youngblood said Thursday. Heber, however, hates the term hero. He told CNN Friday that he doesn't want to be labeled anything except ""teacher."" Classes were canceled for Friday, the school website said, and on-campus counseling was being made available for students in the morning. The wounded student was in critical but stable condition Thursday night, and the shooter was in custody, police said. Heber and his wife, who also works at the school, visited the hospital Friday and met with the father of the victim. The name of the student in custody was not released. He will be charged as a juvenile with attempted murder, according to Youngblood, who added that prosecutors will decide whether he should be charged as an adult. Authorities searched his home, according to sheriff's spokesman Ray Pruitt. Heber, who teaches science, is known as a well-liked teacher at the school, according to his father, David Heber. He is himself a graduate of Taft, where he played football and served as student body president. David Heber wasn't surprised that his son played a key role in defusing the situation, saying Ryan Heber makes a point of getting to know his students -- including the suspected gunman -- on a personal level. ""Because he knows the boy and the boy knows him ... I attribute that to why the boy talked and listened to my son,"" David Heber said. ""It's all about kindness. It's all about my son being kind and caring about his students that makes this successful."" David Heber also said his son, who was standing just a few feet away from the student who was shot, had been hit in the head with a shot pellet, but was fine and didn't seek treatment for it. Nonetheless, Ryan Heber will be coping mentally with a difficult situation, his father said, adding his son slept little Thursday night. ""This was a very upsetting incident,"" David Heber said, describing his son as ""emotionally worn out."" ""It was hard for him. ... but he's come to the conclusion that he did everything he could do."" Ryan Heber told CNN that it wasn't just his students he was worried about as he faced the gunman -- it was also his wife, who works in the business office of the school, and his two sons, ages 5 and 3, at home. As the school went into lockdown amid the shooting, Heber's wife texted him from her office, reminding him to lock his classroom door. His response, according to his father, ""The shooter is in my room."" Ryan Heber said the ordeal has really made him want to come home to his family. The Taft shooting is the latest incident of gun violence that launched a fiery national debate over whether teachers should be armed. Last month the National Rifle Association called on communities to arm teachers or place armed guards in schools as a solution following a Newtown, Connecticut, shooting spree in which a 20-year-old gunman killed seven adults and 20 children at an elementary school. ""The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun,"" said the NRA's Wayne LaPierre. The idea has been rejected by teacher's groups and mayors, including New York's Michael Bloomberg, Boston's Thomas Menino and Philadelphia's Michael Nutter. Related: NRA clarifies its stance on arming schools . The debate prompted CNN commenter Adika to weigh in Thursday, saying, ""So let me get this straight. The NRA wants to have police officers in schools ... yet an unarmed teacher talked a student into surrendering his gun. Besides being one heck of a hero, that teacher just might have some advice for the NRA."" Another CNN commenter, Frank455444, countered: ""Well if the schools are armed and another nut shows up HE GETS SHOT! PROBLEM SOLVED!"" In Utah it's been legal for a dozen years for teachers to be armed in class. Since the law took effect, there have been no school shootings in the state, nor accidents or incidents involving educators' firearms. Immediately after the Taft shooting Thursday, amid the frenzy of desperate parents coming to the school to retrieve their children, parents expressed concern about school security. ""It just goes to show you that we're going to have to do a lot more to protect our students in this small town,"" an unidentified parent told KGET. ""It might be a small environment, but there's always that one bad apple.""","Teacher rejects the label ""hero""

"Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley signed a law Tuesday that drastically raises the safety requirements for abortion clinics to operate -- a measure that he says ""has been endorsed by pro-life groups across America."" But Planned Parenthood immediately warned of ""an almost certain legal challenge,"" saying the new law's requirements ""would be difficult for nearly all providers to meet"" and would shut down clinics. Bentley, a Republican, hailed the new law. ""As a physician, and as a governor, I am proud to sign this legislation,"" he said in a statement. ""This bill provides appropriate standards of care."" Doctors who provide abortions must have admitting privileges at local hospitals, the governor's office said. A similar new law in Mississippi has put that state's only abortion provider ""on the verge of closing"" because of such an admitting privileges requirement, Planned Parenthood said. That clinic is challenging the Mississippi law in federal court, saying the state would end up banning abortion because the clinic's doctors haven't been able to gain the privileges. Nikema Williams, vice president of public policy for Planned Parenthood Southeast, said that ""medical experts agree that laws requiring admitting privileges for abortion don't increase health or safety for a woman. ""They just limit a woman's access to safe and legal abortion,"" Williams said in a statement. ""As a high-quality health care provider working every day to support women's health and safety, Planned Parenthood is evaluating every possible option to protect the health of women in the face of this dangerous law and blatant attack on women's health and rights,"" she said. The Alabama measure passed by overwhelming majorities in both houses of the state legislature. Mike Hubbard, speaker of the Alabama House of Representatives, has said, ""With the passage of this legislation, we are doing everything we can to ensure the procedure is performed in a safe and healthy environment."" North Dakota governor signs law banning most abortions . Once signed, Alabama's new law would require abortion clinics to meet the standards of an ""ambulatory surgical center,"" Staci Fox, a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood, has said. This means the state's five abortion clinics would have to remodel to increase the sizes of rooms and doorways. ""It puts an undue burden on existing facilities. All of this makes it harder to access health care,"" Fox said. The new law also requires doctors at the clinics to ask pregnant minors under age 16 seeking an abortion who the father is, according to a summary of the legislation provided by Hubbard's office. The pregnant minor will be able to refuse to give the father's name and age. Arkansas lawmakers back nation's most restrictive abortion bill . If the girl provides the name and the father is two or more years older than the girl, the facility will have to report the pregnant girl and father to police, the legislation says. The legislation is designed to prevent abuse. The law is the centerpiece of the ""We Dare Defend Our Right to Life"" section of the House Republican caucus's 2013 legislative agenda. The law's House sponsor, Rep. Mary Sue McClurkin, a Republican from Indian Springs Village, Alabama, said abortion clinics truly dedicated to care ""will embrace this legislation rather than oppose it.

"(CNN) -- A Florida exterminator whose dead daughter and injured son were found in his truck has been charged with attempted murder, and police were searching his Miami home Thursday night, police said. Chase Scott, spokesman for West Palm Beach Police, told CNN that officers were executing a search warrant for evidence in the home of Jorge and Carmen Barahona. Jorge Barahona, 53, was found unconscious beside his pest-control truck early Monday along a south Florida interstate by a road assistance ranger, along with his 10-year-old adopted son, who was inside the vehicle next to an open gas can, according to a probable-cause affidavit filed by detectives. Hours later, crews removing toxic chemicals from the truck discovered the boy's twin sister dead in a plastic bag. Earlier Thursday, Barahona was taken to a hospital Thursday after he ""attempted to harm himself,"" police said. Barahona, who was in custody in the Palm Beach County Jail, suffered a self-inflicted injury after deputies told him to get ready to go to a court hearing Thursday morning, West Palm Beach Police spokesman Scott Chase said. ""He immediately attempted to harm himself by thrusting himself backwards, causing an injury to his head,"" Chase said. ""He was immediately checked by emergency personnel and it was decided he was OK to appear in court."" However, Barahona ""refused to cooperate"" by not speaking and the judge decided to delay the hearing until another date, Chase said. Authorities later decided to take Barahona to Wellington Regional Medical Center for observation, he said. Meanwhile, a medical examiner has determined a cause of death for the girl, but it will not be made public until investigators review the findings, Chase said Thursday. Authorities likely will decide whether and how to charge Barahona in her death based on the autopsy results, Police Capt. Mary Olsen said Wednesday. The children were among the four the Barahonas adopted from Florida's foster care system. When the boy was found Monday by the roadside assistance ranger, he ""appeared to be in respiratory distress and (was) trembling"" and his clothing ""was soaked with an unknown chemical,"" the probable-cause affidavit said. The ranger then found Barahona on the ground beside the truck and called for help. The boy was hospitalized in intensive care with severe burns to his abdomen, upper thighs and buttocks, the affidavit said. While examining the boy, doctors noted he had sustained previous injuries, including a broken collarbone, a broken arm, scarring to his buttocks and lower abdomen, and ligature marks on both wrists, police said. After Barahona and his son were taken to a hospital, a worker decontaminating the truck discovered the body of the girl, wrapped in a plastic bag, the document said. Barahona told police he was distraught over the death of his daughter, and had intended to commit suicide by dousing himself with gasoline and setting himself afire, the affidavit said. Barahona said he didn't go through with his suicide plan because his son was with him, the document added. ""Basically, to paraphrase, he was stating that he placed his daughter in a plastic bag being distraught over her death,"" Chase told reporters Wednesday. ""He drove here from South Florida accompanied by his son. ""He then pulled off to the side of the road saying that he poured gas on his self, intending to light himself on fire. His son's head was in his lap and he decided, after giving his son some sleeping pills, that he wasn't going to do that."" Barahona told police that in dousing himself with gasoline, he inadvertently got some on the boy, Olsen said Wednesday. But his story doesn't add up, because there was no gasoline on the boy, she said. Instead, he was covered with another chemical whose composition had yet to be determined. ""That's why we're still treating this as a hazmat (hazardous materials case),"" Olsen said. The truck in which the children were found was taken to a secure location, Chase said, where an FBI evidence recovery team is going through the vehicle. Authorities are waiting for test results on the chemicals found in the truck. Chase said the substance on the boy's body and clothes was so potent that staff caring for the boy at the hospital became ill as well. The boy, who was transferred Wednesday morning to a specialized burn unit at Miami's Jackson Memorial Hospital, has not been able to talk to investigators because he is on a breathing tube, Olsen explained. Asked whether Barahona has expressed remorse, she said, ""He feels remorse, but we're not getting consistent statements with what we're seeing in our evidence."" ""It's a complex case,"" she added. At a hearing Wednesday in Miami attended by Barahona's wife, Carmen, a judge ordered that the remaining two children in the home be placed in foster care. Florida's Department of Children and Families had opened a child protection investigation within the past few days to look into a complaint involving the Barahona family, and it wasn't the first such complaint, spokesman Mark Riordan said. Reporters in the courtroom Wednesday heard tales of abuse, mainly concerning the twins, from state officials and experts. The caller to the child protection hotline in the latest case reported that the twins were routinely locked in a bathroom for long periods of time and had been bound with tape, the court heard. The story was corroborated by interviews with the other two children in the home, officials said in court. An investigator told the court that she went to the family's home on February 11 but had not seen the children. Instead, she said, she left after speaking with Carmen Barahona, planning to return on Monday. Asked why she did not return sooner, she said, ""I'm not allowed to do investigations on a weekend."" However, a spokesman for the department, John Harrell, said it is the job of investigators to follow through immediately or refer to someone else in the department to follow through when a matter is urgent. CNN's Kim Segal contributed to this report.","NEW: Jorge Barahona is charged with attempted murder; home is being searched .

"Tucson, Arizona (CNN) -- A federal judge Wednesday entered ""not guilty"" pleas on behalf of Jared Lee Loughner, the Arizona man accused of fatally shooting six people and wounding 13 others, including U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. Judge Larry Burns also scheduled a May 25 competency hearing for Loughner, and attorneys on both sides will be allowed to hire their own experts to evaluate Loughner's competency to stand trial. Prosecutors sought the competency hearing, saying that Loughner had believed the FBI was bugging him, had extreme animosity toward the government, and was even hearing voices. Loughner's public defenders didn't want such a hearing, saying it would be premature and could interfere with their ability to develop a relationship with Loughner. But the judge said his review of materials relating to Loughner left him concerned. ""We can't do anything until I'm assured that Mr. Loughner is on board and able to assist"" in his own defense, the judge ruled. Last Thursday, a federal grand jury returned a new indictment against Loughner in which he is charged on 49 counts -- including murder and attempted murder -- related to the shooting outside a Tucson supermarket in January. Loughner, 22, entered the courtroom with a slight grin, the first time he's appeared in a Tucson courtroom. His bald head is now showing growing hair. When a clerk asked if his name was Jared Lee Loughner, he responded: ""Yes, it is."" The judge entered the ""not guilty"" pleas for Loughner at his attorneys' request. Loughner waived the reading of all 49 charges against him. In response to motions, the judge ordered prosecutors to release grand jury materials to the defense, but said Loughner's attorneys cannot reproduce the documents or leave copies with Loughner. Burns also ordered the release of findings from authorities' search of Loughner's parents'  home in Tucson, as requested by two Arizona media outlets. Last month, the judge sided with prosecutors in withholding the information because the investigation was ongoing and a grand jury was still preparing an indictment. But with a new indictment now issued, the judge said it is time to unseal the documents relating to what was found in the Loughner family home. ""The active investigation is over,"" the judge said. ""Ninety percent of the information in the warrant domain is already in the public light."" He added, ""There is something mystic and suspicious in not releasing this type of information."" Burns said he will delay ruling on a motion filed by prosecutors Monday to force Loughner to submit a handwriting sample -- a request that he, thus far, has refused. The government wants the sample to compare with handwritten notes found in Loughner's residence that include mentions of Giffords ""as well as references to guns and bullets,"" according to a court document. It says he has resisted such requests to date, ""arguing that the court lacks authority"" to force him to provide a sample. ""There being no other avenue to obtain the defendant's handwriting exemplar, the government now seeks an order to compel,"" prosecutors wrote in the motion. Burns said he wants to discuss some material collected by bureau of prisons on Loughner since he was arrested. Prosecutors said they want the court to review the materials, to see if they should be able to see it. But Loughner's public defenders said they want time to review the matter and prepare arguments in writing. As the hearing unfolded and the judge made his decisions, Loughner sat still. The full courtroom included about 20 family members of victims and seven people supporting Loughner, including a woman who dabbed her eyes with tissue. Among the spectators were Bill Badger, one of two men who jumped on Loughner and subdued him during the shooting, and shooting victim Susan Hileman. Also attending was Mavy Stoddard, who was wounded in the attack and whose husband, Dorwan, a retired construction worker, died trying to shield his wife from the bullets. Loughner's family members declined to comment as they left the courthouse. Tucson attorney Michael Piccarreta, who appeared in court on behalf of slain federal Judge John Roll and his family, was asked by reporters afterward what he thought of seeing Loughner face-to-face. Responded Piccarreta: ""He's just another defendant."" Loughner was earlier indicted on three counts of attempted murder, including one alleging that he tried to kill Giffords with a Glock semiautomatic handgun during the event she was hosting for constituents. Giffords, who was shot in the head, is undergoing rehabilitation at a medical facility in Houston. The new indictment supersedes the earlier one. It adds murder charges connected to the deaths of Roll, a federal district judge, and Gabriel M. Zimmerman, a staff member for Giffords. Loughner also faces charges in the deaths of Dorothy J. Morris, Phyllis C. Schneck, Dorwan C. Stoddard, and a child, referred to in the indictment as C-T G. Nine-year-old Christina-Taylor Green was among those killed in the shooting. Autopsy reports released Monday showed that Zimmerman, Schneck and Stoddard suffered fatal head wounds, while the three others were shot in the chest. If convicted, Loughner could face a death sentence, U.S. Attorney Dennis Burke said last week, although prosecutors have not said whether they will seek the death penalty.

"Washington (CNN) -- A verbal flash-fire erupted on the House floor Thursday night over nine-year battle to pass a benefits bill for emergency workers who were first on the scene of the 9/11 attacks. Frustrated with Republican votes against the $7.4 billion measure because Democrats suspended the rules to prevent them from offering unrelated amendments -- and at the same time requiring a two-thirds majority to pass -- Democratic Rep. Anthony Weiner excoriated the minority party. ""It's Republicans wrapping their arms around Republicans rather than doing the right thing on behalf of the heroes,"" Weiner said during an impassioned, 90-second speech. ""It is a shame. A shame! If you believe this is a bad idea to provide health care--then vote no! But don't give me the cowardly view that 'Oh, if it was a different procedure.'"" The bill failed to get the 291 votes it needed for passage, polling just 255 votes. But that 255 votes easily surpassed the 218 needed for a simple majority. Democratic New York Rep. Carolyn Maloney -- the sponsor of the bill who has been working on the legislation since just after terrorist attacks -- is working to convince  her party's leadership to hold a simple majority vote before the ninth anniversary of the attacks. She told CNN Friday that passing the bill under suspension rules was ""a very high bar."" ""My goal is to have it on the floor again under regular rule, majority rule, which would require only 218 votes. We clearly had the 218 votes to pass it,"" Maloney said. Texas Rep. Lamar Smith, another Republican, opposed the legislation on the basis of cost. He called the bill an ""irresponsible overreach"" that ""does not contain the necessary protections to safeguard taxpayer dollars from abuse, waste and fraud."" ""I think this is another example of the Democrats' insatiable appetite for the taxpayers' hard-earned dollars,"" Smith said Thursday night on the House floor. But Rep. Pete King, R-New York -- who actually voted in favor of the bill -- tipped the debate in another direction, focusing on the Democratic tactic that kept the Republicans from offering up an amendment on illegal immigration. ""But what we are doing tonight is a cruel hoax and a charade,"" King said from the House floor, every bit as passionately as Weiner would moments later. ""Everyone knows that this bill will not get the two-thirds majority required on the suspension calendar. Everyone also knows that this bill would pass with a clear majority if the Democrat leadership would allow it to come to the floor under the regular procedures of the House. ""The reason H.R. 847 is not being brought up under regular order is because the majority party is petrified of having its members face a potential vote on illegal immigration,"" he said. ""You can blame it on the Republicans -- and I've been strongly critical on the Republican position on this issue -- but the reality is you could pass this bill if you wanted to."" King's words set off Weiner. ""It takes great courage to wait until all Members have already spoken and then stand up and wrap your arms around procedure,"" Weiner began. ""We see it in the United States Senate every single day when Members say, 'We want amendments. We want debate. We want amendments, but we're still a 'no.'' And then we stand up and say, 'Oh, if only we had a different process, we'd vote yes. ""You vote yes if you believe yes,"" he said. ""You vote in favor of something if you believe it's the right thing. If you believe it's the wrong thing, you vote no.'' King tried to interject, but Weiner refused to yield the floor. ""The gentleman gets up and yells, trying to intimidate people into believing he's right -- he is wrong!"" Weiner shouted. ""The gentleman is wrong! The gentleman is providing cover for his colleagues rather than doing the right thing!"" ""I will not stand here and listen to my colleague say, 'Oh, if only I had a different procedure that allows us to stall, stall, stall and then vote no.' Instead of standing up and defending your colleagues and voting no on this humane bill, you should urge them to vote yes, something the gentleman has not done,"" Weiner concluded, punctuating his final words with an index finger in the air. King told CNN Friday that if the bill went to simple majority vote he ""would sit with the Democrats all day and defend the bill against the Republicans."" Weiner defended his outburst and acknowledged that many people are unhappy with what they see as partisan bickering in Congress, but he said that many people may not understand what's actually happening. Suspending the rules for certain votes, he said, ""is a common procedure ... used all the time."" ""Frankly, it was beyond a lot of people's understanding why anyone would want to politicize this and make it a long, drawn-out fight,"" he told CNN.","Democrats suspend rules for vote, requiring 2/3 majority .

"What is being called the nation's toughest anti-abortion measure -- a law that bans most abortions after six weeks, when a fetal heartbeat can be first detected -- was signed into law on Tuesday by North Dakota's governor. The law sets the stage for an almost guaranteed legal showdown, with proponents saying the law is intended to test the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that made abortion legal. ""Although the likelihood of this measure surviving a court challenge remains in question, this bill is nevertheless a legitimate attempt by a state legislature to discover the boundaries of Roe v. Wade,"" Gov. Jack Dalrymple said in a statement. The governor directed the legislature to set aside funds to cover the cost of the expected legal battle, which opponents vowed to mount if the governor signed the measure into law. ""North Dakota's governor today effectively banned abortion in the state, with an outrageous and unconstitutional law that will not stand,"" said Cecile Richards, president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. Dalrymple called the constitutionality of the law ""an open question,"" saying the Supreme Court has never considered the ""precise restriction"" of the fetal heartbeat aspect. The Center for Reproductive Rights announced plans late Tuesday to file a lawsuit to challenge the new law. ""We will not allow this frontal assault on fundamental reproductive rights to go unchallenged,"" Nancy Northup, the president of the Center for Reproductive Rights said. While the law does not spell out a specific time frame when a fetal heartbeat can be detected, experts say it is typically six to seven weeks into a pregnancy. The new law targets doctors rather than women having an abortion, with a maximum punishment of five years in prison and a $5,000 fine. Doctors, if convicted, could also lose their license to practice medicine. Under the law, a woman who undergoes an abortion in which a fetal heartbeat has been detected may not be prosecuted for violating the law or conspiracy to violate the law. The law does not rule out abortions when a medical emergency threatens the life of a woman. It does not allow for an abortion in the case of rape or incest, according to Democratic state Sen. Jim Dotzenrod, who voted against the bill. Abortion was legalized in all 50 states in 1973 by the U.S. Supreme Court. Statutory time limits on when abortions can take place, however, vary from state to state. Under Roe v. Wade, abortions are generally permitted until the fetus is considered viable, or able to live outside the womb. Some states have no time limit, while others allow abortion up to the end of the second trimester, about 27 or 28 weeks into the pregnancy. North Dakota's fetal heartbeat law was one of three laws targeting abortion that Dalrymple signed on Tuesday. The other laws are: . -- A ban on the procedure on the basis of genetic defects or gender selections. -- A requirement that doctors who perform abortions have privileges at a North Dakota-area hospital. While proponents say the law will protect the welfare of a woman undergoing a medical procedure, opponents say it will force the closure of North Dakota's only clinic that performs abortions. The laws are set to go into effect on August 1, though a legal challenge could postpone them until the matter is sorted out. This month, Arkansas' legislature passed a bill banning abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy. The state's Democratic governor, Mike Beebe, vetoed the bill, but the Arkansas House voted to override the veto. The Center for Reproductive Rights and the ACLU have vowed to challenge the law in federal court. Called the Arkansas Human Heartbeat Protection Act, the bill requires testing to determine ""whether the fetus that the pregnant woman is carrying possesses a detectible heartbeat.""","The Center for Reproductive Rights says it plans to sue the state .

"French warplanes pounded Islamist militant targets in Mali Thursday as international efforts to help the African nation's government fight insurgents gained momentum. For a fourth consecutive day, airstrikes hit in and around Diabaly -- a town in central Mali, about 400 kilometers (250 miles) north of the capital of Bamako -- prompting men, women and children to flee or find cover, witnesses said. ""People are desperate to get out,"" said Ibrahim Toure, a civilian who left Diabaly on Thursday. French fighter jets targeted the town since Monday, after Islamist rebels settled in a military camp on its outskirts that had been abandoned by Malian soldiers. The Islamists told Diabaly's residents they could stay, and they prevented some from leaving, said Cheick Oumar, a construction worker in the town. Read more: Why Mali matters . ""People are left without protection,"" he said. ""The rebels say they will not hurt anyone, but people are afraid they will turn Diabaly into a new Islamist stronghold and impose Sharia law.""

They also damaged Timbuktu's historic tombs and shrines.

The United Nations has noted accounts of amputations, floggings and public executions such as the July stoning of a couple who had reportedly had an affair. As the rebels moved southward toward Bamako, such reports prompted an international response, led by the French. In addition to sending its warplanes, the French have stationed about 1,400 troops inside Mali in ""Operation Serval."" Europe's largest powers appeared united in their goal of removing al Qaeda-linked militants from the West African nation, where Islamist rebels are fighting to form their own territory in the north.

"After spending years of his life sexually abusing boys entrusted into his care and recent years denying it, Jerry Sandusky is likely to spend the rest of his life in jail. A judge sentenced the 68-year-old former Penn State assistant football coach Tuesday to at least 30 years in prison. He had faced a maximum of 400 years for dozens of charges stemming from his sexual abuse of 10 boys over a 15-year period. Sandusky was convicted in June. After an emotional hearing in which victims detailed the horrors they endured -- and Sandusky still maintained his innocence, portraying himself as a victim -- Judge John Cleland ruled that the ""dangerous"" Sandusky will not be eligible for parole for 30 years. His maximum sentence is 60 years. The once-beloved coach, whose abuse triggered a scandal for one of the nation's most storied college football teams, was given credit for 112 days served. He will also have to cover costs of the prosecution, Cleland said. The amount was not immediately known. ""All the qualities that make you successful concealed your vices,"" Cleland said. ""This, in my view, makes you dangerous."" Victims angrily confront Sandusky at sentencing . He noted the long-term damage Sandusky inflicted on victims: ""This crime is not only what you did to their bodies but their psyche and souls."" Despite the mountain of testimony that convicted him and a plea from a victim Tuesday that Sandusky finally admit his guilt, Sandusky remained stalwart. ""I did not do these disgusting acts,"" he said repeatedly. His attorneys have 10 days to appeal the judge's decision. They have already vowed to appeal his conviction. After the sentencing, defense attorney Joe Amendola insisted that if the team had had more time to prepare for the trial, Sandusky would have been acquitted. Cleland designated Sandusky as a sexually violent offender, which will partially determine where he will be housed in prison and which programs he will be required to participate in, according to Jean Casarez of HLN's ""InSession.""  Sandusky told the judge he did not oppose the status but maintained his innocence. One of his attorneys said before the hearing that Sandusky's legal team would not contest the classification but would stipulate that they disagree with it. Across the country, victims of sexual abuse and organizations that represent them hailed the downfall of the notorious abuser. ""Now that Sandusky will be locked up and unable to harm more children, our hope is that even more survivors will take their first steps towards recovery -- with the confidence that their family, friends and community will believe them and support them,"" said Scott Berkowitz, president of the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network. But the most emotional words of the day came from Sandusky's victims. Some spoke at the hearing, pushing for a harsh sentence, while one and the mother of another offered written impact statements read by the prosecution. ""The pain is real, and it will be inside me forever,"" said a man identified as Victim No. 5. He added that he will never forget the image of Sandusky ""forcing himself on me and forcing my hand on him."" ""He took away my childhood the day he assaulted me, and he should be sentenced accordingly."" Another victim, No. 6, described the ""deep wounds"" that left him praying for help. ""As I put the 1998 incident in the shower into focus, I think about how you manipulated me,"" he said, adding that Sandusky ""called yourself the tickle monster so you could touch me."" Victim No. 4 assailed Sandusky's refusal to acknowledge what he had done. ""Rather than take responsibility for your actions, you attacked us,"" he said. ""My only regret is that I didn't come forward earlier."" In her written statement, the mother of Victim No. 9 said, ""Words cannot describe the pain and impact on my son and family."" ""Because of you, we had to move four times,"" she said. ""I had to endure two attempts from my son trying to take his life. ... You caused him a lifetime of sorrow and suffering. ""I question every decision I made as a parent,"" she added. ""Shame on you, Mr. Sandusky, for your narcissistic and selfish acts. ""Whatever comes to you I hope it is tenfold for what you did to my son and others."" Victim No. 1, in his statement, said of Sandusky, ""There is no remorse ... just evil."" 'Victim 1' sues Penn State over Sandusky abuse . Lead prosecutor Joseph McGettigan said Sandusky is among ""the most insidious and depraved of criminals."" Sandusky founded his charity for young people, Second Mile, to help children but used it to identify victims, McGettigan said. ""He inserted himself into the lives of children, deceiving their mothers."" A touch became a grope and ""too often a penetration,"" McGettigan said. ""No deceit was too shameful for him,"" the prosecutor added. ""He relied on shame to silence his victims. ... He treated his victims like sexual property, which he used as he saw fit."" McGettigan also slammed Sandusky for whining about ""his own pain"" in an audio statement Monday night. Sandusky, speaking for about 13 minutes at the hearing, called his situation ""the worst loss of my life."" ""I will cherish the opportunity to be a candle for others,"" he said, adding that ""somehow, some way, something good will come out of this."" His wife, Dottie, had tears in her eyes. Cleland addressed the victims: ""The fact that you were assaulted is no cause for shame. ...  It is for your courage that you will be remembered.""  And, he said, they will heal. Sandusky entered the courthouse Tuesday wearing a red jumpsuit with a bullet-resistant vest underneath. Though he was handcuffed, he clutched a manila envelope and smiled briefly as he got out of a police vehicle. His wife arrived in the parking lot moments earlier. In his audio statement Monday, Sandusky said, ""They could take away my life, they could make me out as a monster, they could treat me as a monster, but they can't take away my heart."" He accused the judge of bringing the case to trial too quickly, the victims of conspiring together and the attorneys of trying to make money in future civil suits -- which an attorney for Victim No. 5 called ""preposterous."" It has been nearly a year since the Penn State scandal erupted, leading to the firing of iconic head football coach Joe Paterno and the ouster of the university's longtime president, Graham Spanier. Forging a new meaning for the rally cry 'We Are...Penn State' Jurors determined in June that Sandusky, who retired from Penn State in 1999, used his access to university facilities and his foundation for underprivileged youth to sexually abuse the boys. On June 22, Sandusky was convicted on 45 counts of child sex abuse, ranging from corruption of minors to involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, which were laid out in graphic testimony by his accusers over the course of the less-than-two-week trial. During the trial, which garnered national attention and cast a shadow on Penn State's heralded football program, the 23-year-old Victim No. 4 testified that he was only 13 when Sandusky sexually abused him in a university shower. That account is separate from a 2001 incident that Mike McQueary, a former Penn State assistant football coach, testified about, saying he saw the former coach pressed up against the back of a boy in the shower room of the Lasch Football Building. McQueary filed a whistle-blower lawsuit last week against the university, according to a court document from Centre County, Pennsylvania. Less than a month after Sandusky's conviction, former FBI Director Louis Freeh released his university-funded report that blamed Paterno, Spanier, suspended Athletic Director Tim Curley and ex-Vice President Gary Schultz for taking part in a cover-up to avoid bad publicity. When a hero falls off a pedestal . Freeh also said Paterno could have stopped the attacks had he done more, though neither McQueary, Sandusky nor Paterno -- who died in January -- were interviewed by his investigators. Attorneys for Spanier blasted the review, calling it a ""blundering, indefensible indictment"" and ""a flat-out distortion of facts"" that was ""infused with bias and innuendo."" In July, the NCAA imposed sanctions against Penn State, including a $60 million fine, scholarship reductions, the vacating of 112 wins of the football team, five years' probation and a bowl ban for four years. After the sentencing decision was announced, the university's president released a statement. ""Our thoughts today, as they have been for the last year, go out to the victims of Jerry Sandusky's abuse,"" Penn State President Rodney Erickson said. ""While today's sentence cannot erase what has happened, hopefully it will provide comfort to those affected by these horrible events and help them continue down the road to recovery.""","Sandusky will have to cover prosecution costs .

"The family of the first victim to die in the 2001 anthrax attacks will get $2.5 million from the U.S. government under a settlement reached last week, according to court documents. Bob Stevens, 63, worked as a photo editor for American Media Inc. and was the first of five victims of the attacks. He died October 5, 2001, after inhaling anthrax that investigators believe was in a letter sent to American Media, the publisher of the Sun and National Enquirer tabloids, at its offices in Boca Raton, Florida. The FBI eventually blamed the attacks on a civilian scientist at the Army's biological research laboratory at Fort Detrick, Maryland. The suspect, microbiologist Bruce Ivins, had a history of mental illness and killed himself in 2008 before investigators brought charges against him, federal prosecutors said. Stevens' family sued the government for $50 million in 2003, arguing that the military laboratory in Maryland that was identified as the source of the bacterium should have had tighter security. A settlement notice dated November 23 was filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. A separate stipulation of settlement document filed with the court said the government admitted no blame in the case. It also said attorneys fees owed by the Stevens family would come out of the settlement money, at no more than 25% of the total. On October 31, the lawyer for Stevens' family said a settlement had been reached but that final details had to be worked out with the Justice Department. ""I think the family was vindicated that the government has agreed to settle the case with them in spite of the fact that they put up a lot of roadblocks,"" the lawyer, Richard Schuler, said in October. Stevens and his wife, Maureen, were married 27 years, and there is ""still a hole in her life as far as her husband is concerned,"" Schuler said then. ""It's a horrible, painful death, that they had to witness their loved one go through,"" Schuler said. ""It's something that they'll never forget."" A February report by the National Academy of Sciences concluded that it could not reach a ""definitive conclusion"" about the source of the anthrax, which federal agents said had been linked to a sample from Ivins' laboratory. But the FBI and the Justice Department stand by their findings, saying that scientific testing gave agents ""valuable investigative leads"" that led them to Ivins. A CNN Presents investigation in early October revealed that the federal government has spent $19 billion to fight biological attacks. Multiple new labs have since opened to research potential treatments, and the government now counts nearly 15,000 workers  handling germs such as Ebola, plague, and anthrax -- about twice as many as before. The FBI now checks potential workers for felonies and ties to terror groups. But proposed reforms like psychological screening or requiring two people in labs have gone nowhere, with scientists who have reviewed the issue calling those proposals intrusive, expensive and impractical.","The settlement will pay the victim's family $2.5 million .

"Texas law regarding the death penalty often feels like a cultural remnant from the days of cowboys and the Old West: You kill; you get killed. In a recent New York Times article, the headline included the phrase, ""Confronted on Execution, Texas Proudly Says It Kills Efficiently."" The language feels like an understatement considering that 515 inmates have been put to death in Texas since 1982, about 60% of the national total. Unfortunately, efficiency does not equate with accuracy. Robert James Campbell, for example, was convicted of murder and rape. His defense attorneys, however, during his trial in Texas were not allowed to introduce evidence that indicated he was intellectually disabled and struggled with right and wrong. A prosecution expert, arguing for death, said Campbell might be dangerous in the future ""because he is black."" These factors prompted a federal appeals court to stay Campbell's Tuesday execution and allow the introduction of additional evidence at new sentencing hearing. Bernie Tiede, who is white, has had a different experience with Texas justice. Tiede shot an 81-year-old woman in the back and then stuffed her body into a freezer while he continued to live in her home. Although he spent 17 years in prison, Tiede was recently released when the court reconsidered his childhood sexual abuse, the kind of mitigating circumstance not allowed to be part of the record in Campbell's original trial. Tiede's story was turned into the movie ""Bernie"" by Austin filmmaker Richard Linklater, who has given the new parolee a home and arranged for a job. The Texas Tribune, a politics and government news site, wrote two extensive stories about Linklater and Tiede, which gave the killer a sympathetic profile and suggested that parole was a form of justice. Linklater has contributed $10,000 to the news site, according to its own records. When Texas was recently preparing to execute a convicted cop killer from Mexico who had an IQ of 67, I thought of a former prosecutor I knew. In a similar case, he had said, ""If Mexico doesn't want its citizens executed in Texas, they should warn them not to kill people while they are here."" Texas comedian Ron White has joked that while other states are eliminating the death penalty, ""We've been putting in an express lane."" White is right, but Texas is often wrong. According to the Death Penalty Information Center, DNA evidence has exonerated and led to the release of 15 accused killers since 1972. The list of what are often called the top 10 infamous cases of wrongful execution includes five victims from Texas' death row. Two of those provide more than sufficient cause to reconsider capital punishment. Claude Jones, who was executed in 2000, was sitting in a car when an accomplice killed a liquor store owner during a robbery in 1990. The only admissible evidence against Jones was a hair found at the site of the crime. DNA forensics could not prove it was his, but less than a decade later, improved techniques showed that it was the victim's hair, not Jones'. Regardless, Texas Gov. George W. Bush and appeals courts denied Jones a reprieve, and he was executed. Cameron Todd Willingham met the same fate in 2004 after being convicted of killing his three young daughters by setting their home on fire. The Texas Forensic Science Commission investigated the arson evidence against Willingham and concluded that the findings were a product of ""flawed"" processes, five years after he had been put to death in Huntsville. His family has spent the past two years seeking a posthumous pardon from the state but has met with as much denial as during his appeals process. There is sufficient injustice to go around in Texas, but the death penalty, undeniably, is infected with racism. In Houston, prosecutors are three times more likely to seek the death penalty for African-American defendants over white suspects, according to a study last year by the University of Maryland, which looked at 500 cases in Harris County, the state's most populous legal jurisdiction. Professor Ray Paternoster, a criminologist with 35 years of experience, concluded that Houston juries sought the death penalty only 20% of the time when the defendant was white and 70% for blacks. Increasingly, however, sentiments are shifting. We are not likely to grant reprieves to death row inmates, but Texans are beginning to acknowledge inequalities in the administration of executions and the possibility of mistakes. Racial injustices may be why support for the death penalty is showing faltering support in Texas, particularly among an increasingly diverse population. A survey released last month by the Kinder Institute for Urban Research of Houston showed that 69% of the city's residents favor an alternative to execution. Figures indicate that 39% prefer life without parole as an option, and only 28% backed the death penalty. Those numbers reflect the fact that Houston has become the most racially diverse large city in the U.S. Whites now constitute a minority in every age demographic except people over the age of 65. Race, though, continues to be, unquestionably, a factor in Texas justice. Although blacks are fewer than 12% of the population, they make up more than 37% of the state's 500-plus executions since the law was reinstated. Regardless of those disturbing statistics, Texas remains very efficient at carrying out the death penalty. Just not as proficient at delivering justice.","Texas has executed about 500 people since the 1980s, more than any other state .

"Joe Paterno, whose tenure as the most successful coach in major college football history ended abruptly in November amid allegations that he failed to respond forcefully enough to a sex abuse scandal involving a former assistant, died Sunday, his family said. He was 85. The longtime Penn State head coach was diagnosed with what his family had called a treatable form of lung cancer shortly after the university's Board of Trustees voted to fire him. He had been hospitalized in December after breaking his pelvis in a fall at his home and again in January for what his son called minor complications from his cancer treatments. ""It is with great sadness that we announce that Joe Paterno passed away earlier today,"" the family statement said. ""His loss leaves a void in our lives that will never be filled."" Paterno died at 9:25 a.m. Sunday, surrounded by his family, State College's Mount Nittany Medical Center said in a statement. Paterno, who was affectionately known as ""JoePa"" by generations of his players and football fans alike, was widely admired in football circles for what he called his ""Grand Experiment"" -- his expectation that big-time college football players could succeed on the field while upholding high academic and moral standards away from the gridiron. Outpouring of grief at Penn State . Under his leadership, the Nittany Lions won two national championships, went undefeated five times and finished in the top 25 national rankings 35 times, according to his official Penn State biography. At the same time, the program never fell under NCAA sanctions for major infractions while producing 13 Academic All-Americans since 2006. In 2009, according to the university, the Nittany Lions posted an 85% graduation rate. ""The acclaim for Joe Paterno has stemmed largely from the contrast between the high academic and moral standards he has tried to exemplify and the shameless conduct that often embarrasses and dishonors the college sport he cherishes,"" author Michael O'Brien wrote in a 1999 biography of Paterno, ""No Ordinary Joe."" How will you remember him? Penn State's board of trustees and President Rodney Erickson said in a statement, ""We grieve for the loss of Joe Paterno, a great man who made us a greater university. His dedication to ensuring his players were successful both on the field and in life is legendary and his commitment to education is unmatched in college football. His life, work and generosity will be remembered always."" Dignitaries offer condolences . The university is ""considering appropriate ways"" to honor Paterno's legacy, the statement said, and its athletics department is ""consulting with members of the Penn State community on the nature and timing of the gathering."" Paterno was born in 1926 in Brooklyn to second-generation Italian immigrants, according to O'Brien's book. He attended Brown University, where he played quarterback and cornerback, according to another Penn State biography. When Paterno decided to forgo a career in law and make coaching his career, his family said Sunday, his father, Angelo, had one command: ""Make an impact."" ""As the last 61 years have shown, Joe made an incredible impact. That impact has been felt and appreciated by our family in the form of thousands of letters and well wishes along with countless acts of kindness from people whose lives he touched."" Paterno coached at Penn State as an assistant from 1950 to 1965 and became head coach in 1966. Decked out in his soon-to-become trademark thick glasses, white socks and sneakers, Paterno quickly became a memorable fixture on the football field, leading the Nittany Lions to undefeated seasons in 1968, 1969 and again in 1973 and the first national championship of his tenure in 1982. Named National Coach of the Year five times, Paterno was added to the College Football Hall of Fame in 2006, but his induction was delayed until 2007 because of injuries he suffered in a sideline collision. He became the winningest coach in major college football history in 2011 with 409 victories. Paterno ""died as he lived,"" the family statement said Sunday. ""He fought hard until the end, stayed positive, thought only of others and constantly reminded everyone of how blessed his life had been. His ambitions were far reaching, but he never believed he had to leave this Happy Valley to achieve them. He was a man devoted to his family, his university, his players and his community."" Read family statement . In addition to his exploits on the sidelines, Paterno had a significant impact on the university's academic programs. Paterno and his wife, Suzanne, donated more than $4 million to the university over the years for faculty endowments, scholarships and building projects, according to the university. ""Penn State has been very good to both Sue and me,"" he said in 1998, according to his university biography. ""He has been many things in his life -- a soldier, scholar, mentor, coach, friend and father,"" the family statement said. To his wife, ""he was and is her soul mate, and the last several weeks have shown the strength of their love. To his children and grandchildren he is a shining example of how to live a good, decent and honest life, a standard to which we aspire."" Honored with glowing words of praise from players and presidents alike -- President Ronald Reagan said Paterno never forgot that ""he is a teacher who's preparing his students not just for the season, but for life,"" according to a university biography --  he received the National Football Foundation and College Football Hall of Fame Distinguished American Award in 1991. In doing so, he became the first active coach to do so, according to the biography. ""What are coaches?"" he said at the dinner celebrating his award, according to his university biography. ""Number one, we're teachers and we're educators. We have the same obligation as all teachers at our institutions, except we probably have more influence over our young people than anyone other than their families,"" he said. It was his perceived failure to meet those obligations that led to his downfall as the only coach many Penn State football fans had ever known. In October, state authorities charged two university officials with misleading investigators and failing to report alleged sexual abuse in 2002, after a Penn State assistant told a grand jury he saw former assistant coach Jerry Sandusky performing what appeared to be anal sex on a boy in a shower at the football complex. The assistant reported it to Paterno the next day, who said he passed the report along to then-Athletic Director Tim Curley and Gary Schultz, a university vice president who oversaw campus police. Curley went on leave and Schultz retired shortly after the grand jury report was revealed. The next month, the university fired Paterno and Penn State President Graham Spanier. Curley and Schultz, who have pleaded not guilty to charges including perjury and failing to report the alleged 2002 incident, issued statements Sunday expressing their sorrow at Paterno's death. ""Joe has been an integral part of my life for more than 35 years,"" Curley said. ""Joe coached me, mentored me, taught me what it meant to compete with integrity and honor, and above all demonstrated with each day that he lived, the power of humility."" At the time of his firing, Paterno said in a statement released by his son, Scott Paterno, that he was ""distraught"" over the sex abuse scandal. A timeline of Penn State child sex abuse scandal . In an interview with the Washington Post published January 14, Paterno said that he felt inadequate to deal with the allegations. ""I didn't know exactly how to handle it and I was afraid to do something that might jeopardize what the university procedure was,"" the Post quoted him as saying. ""So I backed away and turned it over to some other people, people I thought would have a little more expertise than I did. It didn't work out that way."" SI column: Legacy more than final chapter . Sandusky, who faces more than 50 counts involving sexual acts with 10 boys since 1994, has pleaded not guilty. ""Nobody did more for the academic reputation of Penn State than Joe Paterno,"" Sandusky said in a statement Sunday. ""He maintained a high standard in a very difficult profession. Joe preached toughness, hard work and clean competition. Most importantly, he had the courage to practice what he preached. Nobody will be able to take away the memories we all shared of a great man, his family, and all the wonderful people who were a part of his life."" Bill O'Brien, who was named Penn State's head football coach following Paterno's firing, said Sunday, ""The Penn State Football program is one of college football's iconic programs because it was led by an icon in the coaching profession in Joe Paterno. There are no words to express my respect for him as a man and as a coach. To be following in his footsteps at Penn State is an honor. Our families, our football program, our university and all of college football have suffered a great loss, and we will be eternally grateful for Coach Paterno's immeasurable contributions."" Paterno's family said Sunday he died ""with a peaceful mind, comforted by his 'living legacy' of five kids, 17 grandchildren, and hundreds of young men whose lives he changed in more ways than can begin to be counted."" In lieu of flowers or gifts, the family requests that donations be made to the Special Olympics of Pennsylvania or the Penn State-THON, a charity dance marathon held by Penn State fraternities and sororities.","Paterno's family says he ""fought hard until the end""

"More than 1,200 people have died as the deadliest ever outbreak of Ebola takes hold in West Africa, but despite information campaigns, fear is spreading even more quickly than the virus itself. This week some Ebola patients in Liberia ran away when the healthcare facility they were being treated at was attacked by rioters frightened of the disease. As medical staff and authorities battle to contain Ebola, are rumors and superstition making the situation more difficult? Are myths making the Ebola outbreak worse? ""Absolutely,"" says CNN's Nima Elbagir, adding that the Liberia clinic attack is just one sign of spiraling fear about the disease, which means that those who become sick are terrified of seeking help. The World Health Organization says the ""scale, duration, and lethality of the Ebola outbreak have generated a high level of public anxiety"" over the virus. ""People worry that they will be ostracized by their community if they admit that they are ill or that their loved ones appear to have died of Ebola, so they delay reporting the symptoms, and we've heard anecdotes about secret burials,"" Elbagir explains. A lack of understanding about what causes Ebola and how it is passed on means the region is fertile ground for speculation and mistaken beliefs. And according to the WHO, the already difficult conditions are also being made tougher by public misunderstanding caused by ""rumors on social media claiming that certain products or practices can prevent or cure Ebola virus disease."" What sort of myths and rumors are involved? The WHO reports that at least two people died in Nigeria as a result of drinking salt water, after stories circulated that doing so would protect against Ebola. Other supposed ""cures"" for the disease include raw onions, coffee, condensed milk and holy water. While there are high hopes for experimental medicines and vaccines, the WHO points out there is, as yet, no known cure. ""Decades of scientific research have failed to find a curative or preventive agent of proven safety and effectiveness in humans,"" it says. The organization has warned against paying heed to any old wives' tales about potential treatments: . ""A lot of rumours on social media claiming certain products, practices can prevent or cure #Ebola. They are false, their use can be dangerous,"" it tweeted Tuesday. Earlier this year, at the start of the outbreak, a team from Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), also known as Doctors Without Borders, had to stop working in one isolation ward in Guinea because local residents mistakenly believed they had brought the virus with them. It's a common misconception which makes the work of medical staff harder than it already is, MSF's Dr. Marc Forget told CNN: ""[When we decontaminate houses] they think we are spreading the disease, so some villages just shut down their access, they put trees on the roads."" He says groups from MSF, the Red Cross and the Ministry of Health have also been pelted with rocks as they try to reach Ebola-hit areas. Elbagir says the region's recent history of bloody civil war also feeds the rumor-mill, with some claiming that the fact the army has been deployed to stop people dumping bodies in the streets is a sign the government is deliberately infecting people in order to have an excuse to enforce martial law. Why are they proving so hard to dispel? According to Nima Elbagir widespread suspicion of authority, coupled with a lack of basic infrastructure mean that educating people about how to avoid infection is extremely difficult. ""These are very remote places in countries still bearing the scars of war [in Liberia and Sierra Leone] - people are already traumatized and there is a lot of distrust to be overcome: when the government says something, people don't necessarily believe it,"" she says. ""There aren't enough doctors and healthcare workers - people just aren't used to seeing them in their communities, and so they aren't the figures of authority that they are elsewhere."" Elbagir said the practise of quarantining whole areas ""almost like the plague villages of the Middle Ages,"" had also led to anger and mistrust as entire communities were cut off from vital supplies. ""People say 'We're going to die of hunger before we die of Ebola!'"" she said. The World Food Programme says it is working to ""provide food assistance to around one million people living in restricted access areas in the three affected countries"" in an attempt to ""stabilize affected communities by limiting unnecessary movement and enabling them to cope with lost livelihoods."" ""Emergency food aid is essential to enable people to follow strict quarantine rules, and to help people affected by the shock to recover socially and economically,"" Elisabeth Faure, WFP Guinea's country director said in a statement on the WFP's website. ""We are doing everything we can to continue delivering food to people in need in time."" What can be done to counter the problem? Those working to counteract the spread of Ebola say better health education is needed, to raise awareness of the virus, explain how it is spread and what can be done about it. To do that, they desperately need more people on the ground in the remote regions of West Africa which have been hardest hit by the disease. Forget says the only way to be sure the information is getting through is to pass it on personally. ""We need to go to the thousands of small villages and repeat the message on and on, because there are no radios, no TV there,"" he explains. ""It has to be one by one contact that needs to be done through the chiefs, the local authorities, the youth. It is time-consuming and very difficult."" ""We have about 250 community health workers going village by village to give the right message to the population,"" says Anja Wolz, MSF's emergency coordinator in Kailakun, Sierra Leone. ""Because still we have unsafe burials, done without disinfection, still we have patients who are hiding themselves, still we have patients, or contacts of patients who are running away because they are afraid."" How do people react to Ebola survivors? Elbagir says those ""lucky"" enough to survive the disease frequently find that the stigma attached to Ebola means they are ostracized once they recover. ""They find it very difficult to come back to their communities and be accepted, because people just don't believe that they have been cured,"" she explains. ""There's a lot of superstition, a belief that Ebola is almost a 'curse' and that makes it much more difficult to deal with.""

"Water observed pooling inside an astronaut's helmet was reason enough for NASA to cut short a spacewalk Tuesday morning. The spacewalk outside the International Space Station was planned to last for six and a half hours, but ended after one hour and 32 minutes, said NASA spokesman Kelly Humphries. That makes it, according to NASA's website, the second shortest spacewalk in the history of the space station. Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano and U.S. astronaut Chris Cassidy were to install backup power equipment to critical station components and prepare cables for a new laboratory module that is due to arrive later this year, NASA said. Parmitano and Cassidy were able to complete the first task in the spacewalk, Humphries said. Both astronauts were called back into the station after they and mission control personnel noticed what appeared to be water pooling inside Parmitano's space suit, Humphries said. Parmitano ""reported water free-floating behind his head inside his helmet,"" NASA's website said. Cassidy told mission control that Parmitano said the water didn't taste like normal drinking water, Humphries said. This water was ""not an immediate health hazard"" for the astronaut, the website said. Parmitano did not report any problems breathing, Humphries said. ""It was an orderly situation in which the crew members and the team on the ground reacted per their standard procedures, and determined that they needed to end to protect the safety of the astronauts that were out on the EVA,"" Humphries said. EVA stands for extravehicular activity. The spacewalk, which began shortly before 8 a.m. ET, has yet to be rescheduled. NASA said that another attempt would not be made Tuesday. Mission managers will determine when to reschedule the other tasks that the astronauts would have completed on this spacewalk. An evaluation of what happened is under way, Humphries said.","Astronaut reports water free-floating inside his helmet .

"Legendary Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, the most decorated Olympian of all time, was arrested early Tuesday in Maryland on a DUI charge, according to the Maryland Transportation Authority. Phelps, known as the ""Baltimore Bullet"" and winner of 18 Olympic gold medals, was arrested at about 1:40 a.m. and charged with driving under the influence, excessive speed and crossing double lane lines within the Fort McHenry Tunnel on I-95 in Baltimore, the authority said in a statement. He was later released. Phelps, who returned to competitive swimming in April, said on his official Twitter account that he understands the severity of his actions. ""I know these words may not mean much right now but I am deeply sorry to everyone I have let down,"" Phelps, 29, said in a series of three tweets. USA Swimming issued a written statement Tuesday afternoon. ""The news regarding Michael Phelps and his actions are disappointing and unquestionably serious. We expect our athletes to conduct themselves responsibly in and out of the pool,"" the statement said. A Maryland Transportation Authority police officer was operating a stationary radar on southbound I-395 leaving Baltimore when a white 2014 Land Rover passed traveling at 84 mph in a 45-mph zone. The officer followed the vehicle onto northbound I-95, through the tunnel and stopped the Land Rover just beyond the tunnel's toll plaza. The 22-time Olympic medalist was identified as the driver by his driver's license and appeared to be under the influence, the statement said. ""He was unable to perform satisfactorily a series of standard field sobriety tests,"" the statement added. ""Mr. Phelps was cooperative throughout the process."" Previous run-ins with the law . It was not Phelps' first DUI case. In 2004, he was arrested on charges of driving under the influence in Salisbury, Maryland. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 18 months probation. He also issued an apology after that incident. In 2009, a photograph surfaced of Phelps allegedly smoking pot from a bong at a party. ""I'll make a million mistakes in my life but as long as I never make the same mistake again, then I've been able to learn and grow,"" Phelps told CNN in 2012. He also said that the incident made him realize who his real friends were. After the bong incident, Phelps was suspended from competitive swimming for three months and one of his sponsors said it would not renew his contract . USA Swimming, the nation's governing body for competitive swimming, said it was withdrawing financial support for Phelps and barring him from competition during the period of his ""reprimand."" Kellogg Co. said it would not renew his advertising contract. ""Michael's most recent behavior is not consistent with the image of Kellogg,"" company spokeswoman Susanne Norwitz said at the time. At the time, Phelps admitted ""regrettable behavior"" after a British newspaper published the photograph. The tabloid News of the World showed Phelps using the bong during what it said was a November party at the University of South Carolina in Columbia. Back in the water . In April, back in the pool for the first time since 2012, Phelps was close to his peerless best and raced to a second-place finish in the 100-meter butterfly final in front of a sold-out crowd at the Skyline Aquatic Center in Arizona. Phelps retired after the 2012 Olympics and embarked on a year of travel and golfing, with little mention of a return to swimming. But he sparked speculation about a potential comeback by re-entering the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency's testing program last November -- which began a nine-month wait required before a swimmer can again compete. When the question of a return to Olympic action arose -- with a potential fifth games in Brazil in 2016 -- Phelps would only say he is taking ""one step at a time."" In August, he won five medals at his first international meet -- the Pan Pacific Championships -- since the Olympics. Phelps won the 100-meter butterfly and was on Team USA's winning 800-meter and 400-meter medley relay teams. He took silver in the 200 individual medley and 400-meter freestyle relay. He was selected as the United States Olympic Committee's male athlete of the month. Amanda Bynes arrested on DUI charge .","Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps apologizes to people he ""let down""

"(CNN) In what's sure to be a moment fraught with symbolism and broadcast around the world, an infantry company-sized contingent of Iraqi Peshmerga will cross over Wednesday into Kobani, Syria, from Turkey. They'll bring heavy weapons, artillery and gear crucial to the ongoing Kurdish defense of Kobani, now in its sixth week. But, despite all the attention it will garner, the troop movement doesn't necessarily signal a major shift in the fight, analysts say. ""In terms of a major war that's of some significance to U.S. national security, the arrival of 150 militiamen to an area is probably not of tectonic significance,"" said Steve Biddle, a senior fellow with the Council on Foreign Relations. That's particularly, Washington Institute defense fellow Jeff White says, since most tacticians consider Kobani to be of little inherent strategic interest in the fight against ISIS, which has captured large areas in Syria and Iraq. What could be significant, Biddle says, is the back story explaining how Turkish leaders came to allow the movement in the first place. The United States wants Turkey to do more, including committing ground troops to the fight, Biddle said. It could signal a backroom deal unlocking greater Turkish cooperation in the fight against ISIS, the militant group that calls itself the ""Islamic State."" Or, Biddle says, it could simply be the product of a Turkish government holding its nose in an effort to deal with an increasingly rotten crisis on its doorstep. America's newest allies: Syria's Kurds . The Peshmerga force . The Iraq Peshmerga contingent arrived by air from Irbil, Iraq, and landed in Urfa, Turkey, early Wednesday, Turkey's Anadolu news agency reported. The group was driven in six minibuses toward the border, Anadolu reported, while a separate convoy crossed into Turkey carrying weapons for the Iraqi Kurds. The fighters will enter Kobani soon to reinforce fellow Kurds who are defending against ISIS, a Peshmerga general told CNN on Tuesday. ""The Peshmerga have been ready for a few days, then had logistical problems, but they no longer do,"" Brig. Gen. Halgurd Hikmat said of the Iraqi Kurdish forces. The force is made up of 161 Peshmerga fighters with weapons ""that will be of good help to our brothers in Kobani,"" according to an official with the Ministry of Peshmerga, the defense ministry for the semiautonomous Kurdistan Regional Government in northern Iraq. Separately, about 200 Syrian rebels entered Kobani at dawn Wednesday with weapons that included mortars and heavy machine guns, Syrian rebel commander Col. Abdul Jabar Okaidi told CNN by phone. More fighters are available if needed, he said. What impact will they have? The Peshmerga fighters are better trained and equipped than their Syrian Kurdish counterparts, and are bringing heavy weapons sorely lacking in Kobani, White said. They will roll into a city defended by a beleaguered band of Syrian Kurds and Free Syrian Army fighters who have seen few reinforcements since ISIS' siege of the city began in mid-September. And their arrival probably cements the city's defenses against ISIS, White said. Still, ISIS is also reinforcing its contingent in Kobani, White said, setting out the prospect of a protracted fight over the city that has become important less for its strategic value than its role as a television star. Kobani lies just across the border from Turkey, giving international journalists a clear vantage point to report on the battle there. But there is a military significance as well, analysts say. With all the attention on the fight and both sides bringing in reinforcements, White said, the fight for Kobani continues to give U.S. and allied forces the opportunity to bloody ISIS there, and to keep its forces tied up. ""As long as the city doesn't fall, it works to the advantage of the U.S. strategy,"" he said. ""The ISIS guys who are fighting in the city aren't available to fight somewhere else."" The Turkish role . Turkish officials were not immediately available to comment on Wednesday's Peshmerga movements. But Turkey has previously said it would allow the Peshmerga to pass through its territory into Syria. With ISIS controlling the Syrian land surrounding Kobani, the Peshmerga's easiest path into Kobani is through Turkey. Turkey's decision to let the Peshmerga traverse Turkish territory represented a major policy shift. The Syrian Kurdish fighters, part of the People's Protection Units, or YPG, have ties to the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, which has fought a 30-year guerrilla war against the government of Turkey, where about 20% of the population is Kurdish. Turkey, the European Union and United States consider the PKK a terrorist organization. Earlier this month, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the Syrian Kurdish and ISIS militants were ""terrorists."" The Turkish government also has bristled at the United States' efforts to parachute weapons, ammunition and medicine to YPG fighters. But while Turkey did nothing to intervene in Kobani, Kurds protested in Turkish streets. More than 30 people were killed in cities around Turkey this month as ethnic Kurds clashed with Islamist and nationalist groups as well as Turkish police. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh, Gul Tuysuz, Jason Hanna, Ivan Watson, Zeynep Bilginsoy and Holly Yan contributed to this report.","Peshmerga's arrival will be symbolic, but not a major development, analyst says .

"The submarine's body may be constructed from drainage pipes and the hatch from a recycled skylight, but according to its 18-year-old inventor, this single-person U-boat can plunge to a depth of 30 feet and has already completed three successful dives. The Nautilus took high school inventor Justin Beckerman just six months and $2,000 to put together -- all while keeping on top of his homework. ""He has been building things since he was two years old,"" says his mother, Jess Beckerman.  ""If we tried to help him we would just get in the way and mess things up."" The submarine has ballast tanks to maintain its depth and equilibrium; air vents that bring oxygen down from the surface; a functioning PA and a range of emergency systems including back-up batteries, a siren, strobe lights, a breathing apparatus and a pump to fight leaks. The vessel can remain submerged for up to two hours and travels beneath the waves at one and a half miles per hour. Beckerman says he is going to use it to ""explore the lake, see fish and hopefully find a bit of history, like the cannons from my neighbors' historic house"" that, he says, were dumped in the lake during renovations in the 1960s. When he was younger, Beckerman began by making things out of balloons and string, but as the years went by his inventions grew in scale and complexity. At the age of 12, instead of complaining about having to help with the housework, he developed a remote-controlled car that could mop and vacuum. Beckerman's website is a testament to his enormous productivity. It is a menagerie of home-constructed machines including boats, planes, architectural constructions, and prize-winning robots. The materials he uses in his creations are often technological cast-offs from family and friends, or garbage scavenged from electronics recycling facilities. The Nautilus has regulators and pressure gauges from an old restaurant soda fountain that Beckerman found behind a shopping center. The two main batteries are from a child's ride-on toy, and its PA speakers are made from an old car stereo. Beckerman says he decided to build the submarine because ""I wanted to see if I could do it. It combined so many different aspects of things that I had worked on in the past."" The Nautilus has the most ambitious wiring system Beckerman has installed since he constructed his tree fort -- a veritable forest castle that puts all other tree forts to shame. Armed with more modern conveniences than many proper homes, the fort has a TV, wall-mounted speakers, desktop computer, air conditioning, shelving, and fluorescent lights. ""It has everything a house should have,"" says Beckerman, ""except a refrigerator and a bathroom."" The Nautilus is not Beckerman's first submarine. In fact, it is his fourth. The previous iteration could dive to five feet, but had a less sturdy frame constructed from plastic containers and duct tape. It was propelled by two motor scooter engines, connected to metal blades and two 12v batteries. The new design improves on previous models in almost every way. ""I had an idea of how I wanted to sit. I realized that lying down would make the sub more streamlined -- so the drainage pipes seemed a natural fit,"" he said. But sacrifices to the original design had to be made along the way. ""The ballast tanks were originally going to be air tanks, but they were just too expensive. If I could have learned how to weld I would have made the whole thing out of metal. But that might be for the next one."" Asked if there are any particular challenges which are specific to being a young inventor, Beckerman responds plainly: ""No. Other than the budget issues and all of my schoolwork and other obligations that get in the way."" If he had more time and money Beckerman says he would like to continue to add to the submarine. ""I would love to add a robotic claw to the front. I would like to make the sub into a more useful thing with a basket the claw could put stuff into to pick up garbage and clean the bottom of the lake.""","Mendham High School student Justin Beckerman builds one-man submarine .

"He's played singers, sailors and serial killers, but there's one role that die-hard fans of Jeff Bridges can't get enough of: The stoner. ""Who knows? Mystery of the unknown,"" the Academy-Award winning actor tells CNN about the enduring legacy of ""The Big Lebowski."" ""Maybe it has to do with turning someone on to something you dig; it is like turning your younger brother on to Led Zeppelin, when he's ready to get it."" Sprinkle a healthy dose of ""mans"" and f-bombs into that quote and it could have been uttered by The Dude himself. ""It's something that entertains people on a whole other level than most films,"" Bridges says, ""and once they've enjoyed it, they have to share with someone."" The sharing is certainly growing for ""Lebowski."" This March 6 marks the 15th anniversary of the movie's release. Hard to believe that the Southern Californian odyssey that opened to mixed reviews (The New Yorker called it an ""irritatingly antic caper"") is now considered among the best in the Coen Brothers canon and a bona fide cultural phenomenon. The appreciation goes way beyond the silver screen.  Books are written about ""The Big Lebowski,"" including one by Bridges himself. There are ""Lebowski Fests"" held nationwide where fans gather, often dressed as their favorite characters. The ""Lebowski Fest"" slated for Los Angeles March 22-23 features the actors who played Woo, The Malibu Sheriff and the Ralph's check-out girl who watched The Dude write a 69 cent check for a carton of milk. This past weekend, the now iconic bathrobe worn by Bridges throughout the movie was auctioned off for $22,755, according to Premiere Props in Los Angeles. There's even the ""Little Lebowski Shop"" in New York that sells merchandise ranging from shirts and mugs to action figures and a life-size cutout of The Dude. ""Business has been good,"" says Roy Preston, the owner of the store. ""I have customers coming in ranging in age from 8 to 70 and from all over the world. There's something universal about it that speaks to people."" What's so universal about an unemployed slacker who wears bathrobes, loves White Russians and hates the Eagles? ""He's the unlikely hero of our times,"" says Brian Balthazar, editor of the entertainment  site popgoestheweek.com. ""There are a lot of people that oddly enough want to be like him, to be completely intent in his apathy in life. And then have this guy embark on a crazy journey? It is literally the ultimate dude movie."" A dude movie filled with memorable performances. There's John Goodman as the Vietnam veteran whose observance to the Jewish sabbath prevents him from bowling on Saturdays. (""I don't roll on Shabbos"" he bellows from the lanes.)  John Turturro is the rival bowler named Jesus, who also happens to be a convicted sex offender. Peter Stormare, who played both a porn star and German nihilist in ""Lebowski"" laughs when talking about the film's cult-like following. ""I'm amazed because it's bigger than ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show,"" he says. ""I've been to two or three Lebowski fests and it's pretty bizarre to see 20 Karl Hunguses walking around. It's an honor and at the same time it's a little strange."" Stormare is also surprised by the film's continued success. ""None of us really thought the movie would do well because they didn't do anything big for it when it came out,"" he tells CNN. ""They didn't really promote it, and then it caught on like a sleeper and came just roaring as the years went by."" Bridges cautions that ""Lebowski"" may not be for everyone. ""Your 12-year-old, or your teeny bopper, or most grandparents just won't get it,"" he says while making it clear it may be more of a ""guy"" thing. ""I can just imagine how many older brothers wait for their younger bros to turn 16 or whatever perfect age for them to truly be able to soak in all of the pointless amazingness that the ""Big Lebowski"" has to offer! All the Dude ever wanted was his rug back!"" The Dude abides, and 15 years later, so does the actor. ""I don't see this ever stopping or slowing down,"" says Bridges.","This March 6 marks the 15th anniversary of ""The Big Lebowski's"" release .

"A Swiss couple -- kidnapped in July while traveling in Pakistan's volatile southwestern Balochistan province -- are free, Pakistani military and Taliban officials said Thursday. ""The Swiss ambassador in Islamabad is in direct contact with them and has ascertained that they are uninjured and that, given the circumstances, they are doing well,"" the Swiss Department of Foreign Affairs said in a statement. ""They are currently in a safe place in Pakistan. They will return to Switzerland as soon as possible."" The couple -- Daniela Widmer and David Och -- were taken by helicopter from the Miranshah region to Peshawar and then to Islamabad, the statement said, adding that Pakistani authorities informed the Swiss Embassy in Islamabad of the development. The husband and wife said they escaped from the Taliban upon reaching a military checkpoint near the city of Miranshah in North Waziristan, a tribal region in northwest Pakistan, said Athar Abbas, a Pakistani military spokesman. But a spokesman for the Pakistan Taliban, Ihsanullah Ihsan, said the group released the couple after a council of elders was convened. The two were grabbed at gunpoint in July while traveling in the town of Loralai, senior provincial administration official Sohail Rehman Baloch said at the time. Locals witnessed the kidnapping of the pair, who had been headed to the city of Quetta, Baloch said. The couple entered the province from Dera Ghazi Khan in the Punjab District and registered at a police checkpoint, Baloch said.","The husband and wife say they escaped from the Taliban, the Pakistan military says .

"""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" (B+ Cinema Score) came out of the gates swinging and earned an estimated $92 million over the weekend. Playing in 4,324 locations, this is a solid domestic debut for the Sony sequel starring Andrew Garfield as the nimble superhero, which boasted a $21,000 per-theater average. IMAX showings accounted for $9.3 million of the opening cume from 353 screens. Overall, reviews have been mixed for the Marc Webb reboot (54 percent on Rotten Tomatoes), especially when compared with Sam Raimi's second entry in the Spideyverse (94 percent). But, fans don't seem to mind. Opening weekend audiences gave the film a B+ Cinema Score overall and an A- from the under-25 crowd. Families indeed turned out to see how Peter Parker would fare against all those villains, making up 33 percent of the audience. According to Friday exit sampling of general moviegoers, 61 percent of the audience was male and about 51 percent was under 25. 'Amazing Spider-Man 2' ending: Dissecting those final moments . Many weekend projections (including our own) surmised that the pic would beat, or match, ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier,"" 2014′s highest opener to date ($95 million in early April). But according to initial estimates, that doesn't seem to be the case. Still, Sony is feeling good. Internationally, ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" grossed an estimated $116 million in its third weekend, bringing the overseas total to a mighty $277 million. ""It's a terrific start here in the U.S. and the world result is no less than stunning,"" says Sony's worldwide distribution exec Rory Bruer. ""We had a record-breaking opening in India ($6.5 million, the best-ever for a Hollywood title) and Brazil ($10.5 million, or 76 percent higher than the first). We had fantastic results in France ($10.6 million) and we had a huge day in China ($10.4 million on Sunday). It's popping and working everywhere in the world. We're absolutely on track to not only meet our goals but to exceed them."" In second place, Fox's revenge rom-com ""The Other Woman"" took in $14.2 million in week two. Starring Cameron Diaz, Leslie Mann and Kate Upton as three women who have been cheated on by the same man (""Game of Thrones'"" Nikolaj Coster-Waldau), the Nick Cassavetes-directed pic fills a much-needed programming gap (it's a comedy and female-led) and it's showing at the box office. Marketing hasn't pushed the potential appeal to male audiences, so don't expect to see ""Bridesmaids"" numbers here. But, Cameron Diaz could have an incredibly strong 2014 on her hands with ""Sex Tape"" (July 25) and the Will Gluck-directed ""Annie"" remake (December 19). 'Godzilla' clip: Prepare the (other) monster for battle . ""Heaven Is for Real"" snagged the third-place spot in its third weekend with an estimated $8.7 million. That's only a 39 percent drop. The $12 million Christian pic starring Greg Kinnear as a pastor whose son claims to have visited heaven after surviving a near-death experience has earned about $65.6 million so far, beating this year's ""Son of God"" and surpassing the surprise hit ""God's Not Dead,"" which is still playing in theaters. In fourth place, Disney and Marvel's ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" fell 52 percent with an estimated $7.8 million after five weekends in theaters, bringing its domestic cume to $237.1 million and its international take to a whopping $679.8 million, 83 percent above the first film. ""Captain"" is running circles around 2013′s ""Thor: The Dark World,"" which earned a total of $206 million domestically ($449 million global) thanks in no small part to the $115 million from China. Finally, in fifth place, ""Rio 2"" passed the $100 million mark this weekend with an estimated $7.6 million in its fourth weekend in theaters. The $103 million Fox-distributed pic, featuring the voices of Anne Hathaway and Jesse Eisenberg, is still trailing a bit behind the original ""Rio,"" which had earned $115 million by this time in 2011. Here's the top five: . 1. ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" — $92 million (domestic total: $92 million) 2. ""The Other Woman"" — $14.2 million (domestic total: $47.35 million) 3. ""Heaven Is for Real"" — $8.7 million (domestic total: $65.6 million) 4. ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" — $7.8 million (domestic total: $237.1 million) 5. ""Rio 2""  — $7.6 million (domestic total: $106.5 million) In the specialty box office world, Amma Asante's ""Belle"" opened in four theaters to $104K. Starring Gugu Mbatha-Raw as the illegitimate mixed-race daughter of a British naval officer, ""Belle"" tells the story of her aristocratic upbringing and political awakening in 18th century England. The Fox Searchlight pic had the best per-theater average ($26,000) of any of the films released this weekend. Meanwhile, Focus Feature's ""Walk of Shame"" flopped with the day-and-date release, taking in only $38,000. Playing in 50 locations, the Elizabeth Banks comedy about a woman who loses everything after a one-night stand and must trek across L.A. the next morning to make an interview for her dream job had a terrible $745 per-theater average. Review: 'Walk of Shame' The combination of VOD availability and dismal reviews worked against this one. In his ""D"" review, Joe McGovern called it ""a lumpy and laughless farce from writer-director Steven Brill (""Little Nicky""), a man who never told a joke he couldn't ruin.""

"The deadly siege of a central Sydney cafe has ended but the investigation is just beginning. Australian authorities stormed the cafe where a self-styled Muslim cleric had been holding hostages early Tuesday, killing the gunman. They moved in some 16 hours after the siege began, after hearing gunfire inside the Lindt Chocolate Cafe, New South Wales police Commissioner Andrew P. Scipione told reporters. Two of the 17 hostages initially held by the gunman died, according to Scipione. They were later identified as Katrina Dawson, 38, and Tori Johnson, 34. Other people were injured, including a police officer who suffered a wound to the face from gunshot pellets. All were described by police to be in stable condition. ""Understandably, there is a lot of speculation, but it will take time to clarify exactly what happened ... and why,"" Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott told reporters Tuesday. What did the gunman want? Why did he choose the cafe as his target? ""There is nothing more Australian than dropping in at the local cafe for a morning coffee, and it's tragic beyond words that people going about their everyday business should have been caught up in such a horrific incident,"" Abbott said. He offered his condolences to people caught in the attack and to their loved ones. ""These events do demonstrate that even a country as free as open as generous and as safe as ours is vulnerable to acts of politically motivated violence,"" the Prime Minister said. ""But they also remind us that Australia, and Australians are resilient and we are ready to respond."" Gunman had violent history . The gunman was identified as Man Haron Monis by an official with direct knowledge of the situation. According to his social media posts, the hostage-taker appears to have embraced a radical Sunni theology. Abbott told reporters that the gunman was already well-known to authorities, and that he had a ""long history of violent crime, infatuation with extremism and mental instability."" Before the raid, Monis had demanded a flag and phone call with Abbott, CNN affiliate Sky News Australia reported. He made the demands through hostages who contacted media organizations, Sky News reported. Some hostages had also reportedly posted messages to social networking sites and the YouTube online video service. Police urged media early Tuesday not to show the videos. Monis, also known as Sheikh Haron, pleaded guilty in 2013 to writing letters to relatives of Australian service members saying they were ""Hitler's soldiers,"" according to Australian media reports. He was believed to be acting alone, and he didn't appear to be part of a broader plot, additional U.S. law enforcement and intelligence sources said. The scene in Sydney: Grenades and gunfire . How the siege unfolded . Hundreds of police officers, including snipers, surrounded the cafe in Sydney's central business district shortly after the gunman took over the building at 10 a.m. Monday (6 p.m. ET Sunday). Chilling images from Australian media showed people, believed to be hostages, with their hands pressed against the cafe's windows. They were holding up a black flag with Arabic writing on it reading, ""There is no God but God and Mohammed is the prophet of God."" Five hostages sprinted out of the cafe toward heavily armed police officers several hours into the standoff, sending the gunman into a tirade, according to an Australian reporter. Chris Reason, a correspondent for CNN affiliate Seven Network, said the gunman became ""extremely agitated"" when he realized what had happened and ""started screaming orders"" at the remaining hostages. Reason said he could see the gunman pacing past the cafe's windows from his vantage point at the network's nearby offices. He described the man as unshaven, wearing a white shirt and black cap and carrying a shotgun. As night fell, lights went out in the cafe, Reason reported. After a tense night, police could be seen early Tuesday throwing flash-bang grenades into the cafe in video aired by Seven Network. Gunfire erupted amid the chaos. A national security source in the United States said that a team of Australian special forces troops and police had entered the Lindt Chocolate Cafe from two directions and killed the gunman. Video captured medics working on some people and others being carried away on stretchers. On Tuesday, the hostages who died were identified as Dawson and Johnson. ""Katrina was one of our best and brightest barristers who will be greatly missed by her colleagues and friends at the NSW Bar,"" the New South Wales Bar Association said in a statement. ""She was a devoted mother of three children and a valued member of her floor and of our bar community. Our thoughts are with her family at this time."" Johnson's family also released a statement. It read, in part: ""We are so proud of our beautiful boy Tori, gone from this Earth but forever in our memories as the most amazing life partner, son and brother we could ever wish for.""","The hostages who died are identified as Katrina Dawson and Tori Johnson .

"Wednesday afternoon, former teacher Ingrid Loyau-Kennett was just a passenger on a bus passing through southeast London. Thursday she was being hailed as one incredibly brave woman who confronted a man seconds after he hacked a British soldier to death in broad daylight. READ MORE: Cameron condemns brutal hacking death, says Britain stands firm . It began when Loyau-Kennett, a Cub Scout leader, peered out of her window on the Number 53 bus, according to London's Guardian newspaper. She saw a car that looked like it had crashed and a man on the sidewalk. ""I thought it was a bit bizarre,"" she said. Thinking she could help, she got off the bus and hurried toward the bloody man. ""When I approached the body, there was a lady cradling him,"" Loyau-Kennett said on ITV's ""Daybreak"" Thursday morning. Watch her recount what happened . She took stock of who was around. There were two men with weapons including a butcher knife and a meat cleaver. She earlier told the London Daily Telegraph one had a revolver. One man's arm and hand were soaked in blood. ""The guy who was the most excited of the two said, 'Don't go too close to the body,'"" she recalled. Her eyes zeroed in on the man's weapon and the blood. In a few seconds, Loyau-Kennett's mind tried to process what she was seeing. ""I thought, 'What the heck, what happened there?' And I thought, 'OK, obviously he's a bit excited.'"" And then Loyau-Kennett did something that most people probably cannot imagine. She started talking to him. ""I thought I had better start talking to him before he starts attacking somebody else,"" she told the Daily Telegraph. ""I thought these people usually have a message, so I said, 'what do you want?'"" Indeed the men had a message. ""The only reasons we killed this man ... is because Muslims are dying daily,"" he said in video aired by CNN affiliate ITN. ""This British soldier is an eye for an eye, a tooth for tooth,"" the man said in the video. ""We swear by almighty Allah we will never stop fighting you until you leave us alone."" Loyau-Kennett kept trying to engage the man. ""I asked him if he did it and he said yes and I said why? And he said because (the victim) has killed Muslim people in Muslim countries. He said he was a British soldier, and I said really, and he said, 'I killed him because he killed Muslims and I am fed up with people killing Muslims in Afghanistan. They have nothing to do there,"" Loyau-Kennett said, according to the Telegraph. As she recalled the ordeal to ""Daybreak,"" incredulous journalists asked her how she found the courage to continue to talk to a man holding a knife who had clearly just murdered someone steps away. ""Are you trained in any way to do this?"" a journalist asked her. No, Loyau-Kennett responded, laughing a little. ""I used to be a teacher and (that) can be stressful at times."" ""I know it's big to die but, for me, it was just a regular guy ... just a bit upset,"" she explained. ""He was not on drugs, he was not drunk."" But she did get nervous. At some point, Loyau-Kennett took a moment to look around and realized that many people were snapping photos and taking videos. ""There is so many people around,"" she said on ""Daybreak."" ""I mean ... I just look(ed) one, two second(s) around, (and it was) so daunting, so many people watching like this."" She worried that the man might react to the attention and try to hurt her or someone else. But, she said, ""I said to myself, 'Just carry on.'"" So she kept engaging him. A ""Daybreak"" journalist asked: ""Were you scared for yourself?"" ""No,"" Loyau-Kennett replied. ""Why not?"" ""Better me than the child,"" she answered, explaining that she realized there were mothers and children walking nearby. The scene was not far from a school. ""It was more and more important that I talk to him,"" she said. Loyau-Kennett kept asking the man, ""What would you like?"" ""I tried to make him talk about what he felt,"" she told journalists. He told her that he was tired of bombs being dropped in Muslim countries and Muslim women and children being blindly killed. As this went on, Loyau-Kennett thought: When are the police coming? But, still, she asked the man, ""Is there anything I can do for you?"" ""He said, 'If the police come, I just shoot them.'"" Out of the corner of her eye, Loyau-Kennett said, she saw the bus start moving. It was going to leave without her and she had to go. She figured the police were going to get there any second. So Loyau-Kennett got on the bus and left. It took armed officers 14 minutes to arrive, according to London Metropolitan Police. Two suspected attackers were shot by police at the scene and are being treated in London hospitals. Authorities have not released their names.

"An 8-year-old Louisiana boy intentionally shot and killed his elderly caregiver after playing a violent video game, authorities say. Marie Smothers was pronounced dead at the scene with a gunshot wound to the head in a mobile home park in Slaughter, Louisiana, the East Feliciana Parish Sheriff's Department said in a prepared statement. Slaughter is about 20 miles north of Baton Rouge. Authorities identified the woman as the boy's ""caregiver,"" without stating whether she is a relative.  But CNN affiliate WBRZ reported that the woman was the boy's grandmother. Smothers was 87, public records show. ""By accounts of relatives of the victim, as well as friends of the family, the victim and the juvenile had a normal, loving, relationship and even shared the same bedroom,"" the sheriff's department said. The gun belonged to Smothers, WBRZ reported. CNN affiliate WAFB reported that a man identifying himself as the boy's father also said the gun belongs to Smothers. Although the boy initially told investigators that he accidentally shot the woman Thursday while playing with a firearm, the probe led authorities to believe he ""intentionally shot Mrs. Smothers in the back of the head as she sat in her living room watching television,"" the sheriff's department statement said. The boy won't face charges. Under Louisiana law, a child younger than 10 is exempt from criminal responsibility. ""We have a child who does not know the impact of the consequences of the act he committed,"" Sclynski Legier, a lawyer, told CNN affiliate WAFB. ""He truly doesn't understand that."" The boy is now with his parents. Neighbors say the mobile home park is generally a quiet and safe place, and they wonder why precautions hadn't been taken. ""Where did she have the gun? Where was It placed? Was it in his eyesight? That's what kind of thoughts are going through my head,"" Johnnie Scott told WBRZ. Violence in video games . While the motive is unclear, the sheriff's department implied the child's activities in a violent virtual world may have led to the killing. ""Although a motive for the shooting is unknown at this time investigators have learned that the juvenile suspect was playing a video game on the Play Station III 'Grand Theft Auto IV,' a realistic game that has been associated with encouraging violence and awards points to players for killing people, just minutes before the homicide occurred."" The game's maker, Take Two Interactive, rejected the link. ""Ascribing a connection to entertainment -- a theory that has been disproven repeatedly by multiple independent studies -- both minimizes this moment and sidesteps the real issues at hand,"" the company said in a statement. Studies by reputable academic and medical sources have come to a variety of conclusions. The Obama administration has called for more research. Critics of video game violence and industry supporters have long debated whether virtual violence leads to actual violence. The argument has become more heated since 26 people died in a December shooting rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. The shooter, Adam Lanza, was reportedly obsessed with violent video games. Is media violence damaging to kids? Speaking soon after the shootings at Sandy Hook, Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, who led his state through grieving after a mass shooting at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, speculated about a connection. ""There might well be some direct connection between people who have some mental instability and when they go over the edge -- they transport themselves, they become part of one of those video games,"" he said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""Perhaps that's why all these assault weapons are used."" A month after the Sandy Hook shooting, John Riccitiello, president and CEO of the video game maker Electronic Arts, said in a conference call with bank analysts there wasn't a connection, but the industry faces a ""perception issue,"" the BBC reported.

"Curiosity, humanity's most powerful rover  to land on Mars, has made a startling discovery: Conditions that could have supported life once existed there. ""We have found a habitable environment that is so benign, and supportive of life, that probably if this water was around and you had been on the planet, you would have been able to drink it,"" John Grotzinger, Curiosity project scientist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, said in a Tuesday news conference. This discovery is based on the chemical analysis of powder that the rover recovered by drilling a hole in a rock. This was the first time a robot sent from Earth had drilled on another planet. The powder from the drilling turned out to have a wealth of chemicals in it, including sulfur, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and carbon. These are ingredients for life, scientists said. ""What do we mean by habitability? The key thing here is an environment that a microbe could have lived in and maybe even prospered in,"" Grotzinger said. Powder from the drill was a gray-green color, meaning it was not highly oxidized, said David Blake, principal investigator for Curiosity's Chemistry and Mineralogy investigation at NASA's Ames Research Center. That means if there were organic material present there, it could have been preserved. Mars rover drills, sees planet's true colors . The sample had between 20% to 30% of a type of clay called smectite, which forms in the presence of water, Blake said. In Yellowknife Bay, the area where the rover is located, it appears ""slightly salty liquid water"" was once there, said Michael Meyer, lead scientist for the Mars Exploration Program at NASA Headquarters in Washington. These observations contrast sharply with the findings of Mars rover Opportunity, which landed on a different part of Mars in 2004 and is still chugging along. A rock that Opportunity found called Wopmay appeared to be made of hematite with iron-bearing sulfates, indicative of acidic water. That would not have been a habitable environment. The rock that Curiosity found, on the other hand, has calcium sulfate and seems to have been in water with a neutral pH. ""This rock quite frankly looks like a typical thing that we would get on Earth,"" Grotzinger said. What we've done on Mars, and what's next . Here's something else exciting: Grotzinger also described what he termed ""batteries."" Some of the minerals found have various charges and oxidation states. Modern microbiology has determined that tiny organisms can derive energy by feeding on rocks. Life on Mars could have taken the form of a microorganism that used the minerals as an energy source. He compares this to a battery-powered light, in which you hook up the wires and electrons flow to make a light bulb turn on. Scientists don't have any other examples of extraterrestrial environments with this distinction of having been able to support life. ""This is probably the only definitely habitable environment that we've described and recorded,"" said Paul Mahaffy, principal investigator for Curiosity's Sample Analysis at Mars investigation at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. With the habitability issue out of the way, Curiosity has yet to explore the question of organic molecules, which could indicate life but could also come from other sources. Grotzinger identified several challenges with this. For example, although the findings concerning water are exciting, the presence of water may mean that organic molecules indicative of life were not well-preserved, Grotzinger said. A lot of organic compounds also are degraded in the presence of heat, he said. Mars appears to have cooled with time, so radiation may be the problem instead. ""Our trick is to find a place where all ... of those things went right, and that could take the entire length of this mission, but we're going to give it our best,"" he said. But organic molecules could be manufactured on Mars from nonlife sources, or they could come from meteorites and comets. Mars rover spots shiny objects . It's also important to note that Curiosity is not a life-detection mission. ""If there was microbial metabolism going on, we wouldn't have the ability to measure that,"" Grotzinger said. And if there were microbial fossils in the rock,  the rover would not be able to resolve individual fossil microbes even with the many cameras on board Curiosity, including the high-powered MAHLI, Grotzinger said. Curiosity won't make its second drill hole until May. Scientists are excited about that because the first sample could have been tainted by material analyzed at a different site on Mars. The 2-ton rover landed on Mars on August 6 in a series of acrobatic maneuvers dubbed the ""seven minutes of terror."" The mission comes with a price tag of $2.5 billion. Scientists have now confirmed that each of the many intricate instruments on board the rover are working. ""The rover is now fully commissioned for science,"" Meyer said. He added, ""The keys to rover have been turned over to science team - Woohoo!"" Curiosity landed in Gale Crater, which hosts a mound called Mount Sharp. The bedrock in the crater where the rover drilled appears to be located in an ancient network of stream channels, which came down from the crater's rim, NASA said. Curiosity still has plans to travel to Mount Sharp, where it will slowly climb a mountain analyzing the sedimentary rock  to explore its geological history. ""The question is: How many of these different kinds of 'batteries' can we find at Gale Crater? I think that really becomes our mission along with the search for organic compounds,"" Grotzinger said.

"The weekend's sermon at Saddleback Church was ""Surviving Tough Times,"" a theme Pastor Rick Warren planned before his youngest son killed himself with a gun Friday. Matthew Warren, 27, committed suicide ""in a momentary wave of despair"" at the end of a lifetime struggle ""with mental illness, dark holes of depression and even suicidal thoughts,"" the pastor wrote to the staff of his Southern California megachurch. ""Matthew was an incredibly kind, gentle and compassionate young man whose sweet spirit was encouragement and comfort to many,"" a statement from the church said. ""Unfortunately, he also suffered from mental illness resulting in deep depression and suicidal thoughts. Despite the best health care available, this was an illness that was never fully controlled, and the emotional pain resulted in his decision to take his life."" Friend Mike Constantz told CNN he had a ""playful spirit."" ""There are the days where he was just this bubbly, outgoing, effervescent, reaching out to people,"" Constantz said.  ""And there were the days where he just didn't want to be around people. Just the pain, the excruciating pain, was just too much."" My Take: How churches can respond to mental illness . A prophetic message? Worship services continued as scheduled Saturday and Sunday with Warren's brother-in-law Tom Holladay -- an assistant pastor for the Orange County, California, congregation -- filling in for Warren.  Warren asked Holladay to take over when he became ill with pneumonia after a busy Easter weekend schedule, before his son's sudden death, spokeswoman Anne Krumm said. ""Bad days make good ones better,"" Warren's invitation to Saturday's service said on the church's Facebook page . ""It's a message on what to do on the worst day of your life,"" Holladay said in Saturday's sermon.  ""So even before Rick knew what they would be facing at the end of the week, he was thinking this is what we need to hear.  And it is what we need to hear."" Matthew, the youngest of Warren's children, worked at the Saddleback Resources Warehouse, which distributes books and DVDs and was ""an important part of the church but played a quiet role,"" Krumm said. ""After a fun evening together with Kay and me, in a momentary wave of despair at his home, he took his life,"" Pastor Warren wrote in an e-mail to his staff Saturday. He was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at his home in Mission Viejo, California, late Friday afternoon, the Orange County Coroner said.   The autopsy completed Monday put the time of death at around 10 a.m. Friday. As a pioneer of the megachurch movement, Rick Warren looked to translate traditional evangelical messages to a wider audience. Warren, who founded Saddleback with his wife 33 years ago, gave the invocation at President Barack Obama's 2009 inauguration and penned ""The Purpose-Driven Life,"" a Christian self-help guide that became a mainstream best-seller. My Take: Let's stop keeping mental illness a secret . Rick Warren's e-mail . Subject: Needing your prayers . To my dear staff, . Over the past 33 years we've been together through every kind of crisis. Kay and I've been privileged to hold your hands as you faced a crisis or loss, stand with you at gravesides, and prayed for you when ill. Today, we need your prayer for us. No words can express the anguished grief we feel right now. Our youngest son, Matthew, age 27, and a lifelong member of Saddleback, died today. You who watched Matthew grow up knew he was an incredibly kind, gentle, and compassionate man. He had a brilliant intellect and a gift for sensing who was most in pain or most uncomfortable in a room. He'd then make a bee-line to that person to engage and encourage them. But only those closest knew that he struggled from birth with mental illness, dark holes of depression, and even suicidal thoughts. In spite of America's best doctors, meds, counselors, and prayers for healing, the torture of mental illness never subsided. Today, after a fun evening together with Kay and me, in a momentary wave of despair at his home, he took his life. Kay and I often marveled at his courage to keep moving in spite of relentless pain. I'll never forget how, many years ago, after another approach had failed to give relief, Matthew said "" Dad, I know I'm going to heaven. Why can't I just die and end this pain?"" but he kept going for another decade. Thank you for your love and prayers. We love you back.

"After moving to New York, Brian Moore could not stop running into his ex-girlfriend. There were four awkward and unplanned encounters in six months, to be exact. So while most social apps are about connecting with friends, family or good-looking strangers, Moore began to wonder if a mobile tool could use the same readily available location information to help you avoid certain people. That's how he and Chris Baker were inspired to create Cloak, a free iPhone app that pulls in location check-ins from your contacts' Instagram and Foursquare accounts. It maps out the positions of people you know based on their most recent social posts so you can give them the slip. Cloak's tagline is ""Incognito mode for real life."" You might say it's an anti-social network. Click on a bubble on the map, and you'll see a person's name, his or her location and about how long ago he or she checked in there. If it was a while ago, the image will appear faded, like a ghost. ""We feel like we've reached the point of social fatigue -- too many networks with too much information, all the time,"" Baker says. ""It's OK to turn off and pick up a copy of 'Walden' and just be alone."" The app lets people set up push alerts for acquaintances they'd prefer to avoid such as exes, frenemies or annoying co-workers. If someone wants to drop off the grid completely, he can set up these notifications for everyone in his social networks -- presumably while sneaking through dark alleys or hiding behind sunglasses and a hat. The app only works with Foursquare and Instagram for now, so it has limited usefulness if your friends aren't active on those networks. But the developers hope to add Facebook soon. They say Twitter's location information is still weak, but they may add that service as well someday. Dodging friends isn't necessarily an anti-social activity. Baker says there are plenty of times a person might want to avoid being seen, such as while on a first date or during a quick run to the grocery store in pajamas. Anyone playing hooky, recovering from plastic surgery or carrying on a clandestine relationship might also find the app useful. For some digital users, the move away from always-on oversharing is a natural progression. After years of being on our phones 24/7, getting constant updates from our social networks and broadcasting our every social outing, many of us crave a break. All that contact online can leave us wanting more privacy in real life. ""Twitter and Facebook ... are like giant auditoriums where we put on 'public performances.' And those have grown exhausting. That's why Snapchat felt so refreshing,"" Moore says. The app is still young, but Moore says users have already found creative, social ways to use it. Some are exploring Instagram images by using the map, while others have set up alerts for people they do want to see. In theory, someone could use the app purposefully to run into people who'd rather be ignored. To prevent any unwanted abuse of your location information, lock down your privacy settings and don't share your whereabouts unless you're comfortable with people knowing exactly where you are. ""Social has had its moment in the sun. Now people are beginning to revolt,"" Baker says.","A new iPhone app helps you avoid running into people you'd rather not see .

"(CNN) -- A Florida pastor told CNN on Tuesday that while his congregation still plans to burn Qurans to protest the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the church is ""weighing"" its intentions. Terry Jones, pastor of Dove World Outreach Center in Gainesville, Florida, who was interviewed on CNN's ""American Morning,"" said the congregation is taking seriously the warning from the U.S. military that the act could cause problems for American troops. ""We have firmly made up our mind, but at the same time, we are definitely praying about it,"" Jones said. Later Tuesday, Jones had a response to a statement from Gen. David Petraeus, the U.S. commander in Afghanistan, who said the burning of Islam's holy books ""could cause significant problems"" for American troops overseas. ""It could endanger troops and it could endanger the overall effort in Afghanistan,"" Petraeus said in a statement issued Monday. ""The general needs to point his finger to radical Islam and tell them to shut up, tell them to stop, tell them that we will not bow our knees to them,"" Jones said on CNN's ""AC360."" ""We are burning the book,"" Jones said. ""We are not killing someone. We are not murdering people."" The planned action has drawn sharp criticism from Muslims around the world and from U.S. officials. The U.S. Embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan, on Tuesday issued a statement saying the U.S. government ""in no way condones such acts of disrespect against the religion of Islam, and is deeply concerned about deliberate attempts to offend members of religious or ethnic groups."" It emphasized that it strongly condemned ""the offensive messages, which are contrary to U.S. government policy and deeply offensive to Muslims especially during the month of Ramadan."" ""Americans from all religious and ethnic backgrounds reject the offensive initiative by this small group in Florida. A great number of American voices are protesting the hurtful statements made by this organization,"" the embassy said. With about 120,000 U.S. and NATO-led troops still battling al Qaeda and its allies in the Islamic fundamentalist Taliban movement, Petraeus warned that burning Qurans ""is precisely the kind of action the Taliban uses and could cause significant problems -- not just here, but everywhere in the world we are engaged with the Islamic community."" Petraeus said he was concerned about the political repercussions of the church's plan. ""Even the rumor that it might take place has sparked demonstrations such as the one that took place in Kabul yesterday,"" he said. ""Were the actual burning to take place, the safety of our soldiers and civilians would be put in jeopardy and accomplishment of the mission would be made more difficult."" One of Petraeus' deputies, Lt. Gen. William Caldwell, told CNN's ""The Situation Room"" that the event ""has already stirred up a lot of discussion and concern"" among Afghans. ""We very much feel that this can jeopardize the safety of our men and women that are serving over here in the country,"" said Caldwell, the head of NATO efforts to train Afghan security forces. Caldwell said American troops ""are over here to defend the rights of American citizens, and we're not debating the First Amendment rights that people have."" But he added, ""What I will tell you is that their very actions will in fact jeopardize the safety of the young men and women who are serving in uniform over here and also undermine the very mission that we're trying to accomplish."" ""I would hope they would understand that there are second- and third-order effects that will occur that will affect that young man and woman who's out there on point for America, serving their nation today, because of their actions back in the United States,"" he said. Thousands of Indonesians gathered outside the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia, on Sunday to protest the planned Quran burning. ""The burning is not only an insult to the holy Quran, but an insult to Islam and Muslims around the world,"" said Muhammad Ismail, a spokesman for the hard-line Indonesian Muslim group Hizb ut-Tahrir. Jones said his congregation is aware that the action is offensive. ""We realize that this action would indeed offend people, offend the Muslims. I am offended when they burn the flag. I am offended when they burn the Bible. But we feel that the message that we are trying to send is much more important than people being offended."" Jones said Muslims are welcomed in the United States, if they observe the Constitution and don't try to impose Sharia law, or Muslim law. The message, he said, is directed toward the ""radical element of Islam."" ""Our message is very clear,"" he said. ""It is not to the moderate Muslim. Our message is not a message of hate. Our message is a message of warning to the radical element of Islam, and I think what we see right now around the globe provides exactly what we're talking about,"" he said. The center says it was founded in 1986 as a ""total concept church for the rich, the poor, the young and the old."" Its purpose is to ""stand up for righteousness and for the truth of the Bible."" It stresses that ""Christians must return to the truth and stop hiding."" ""We need to speak up against sin and call the people to repentance. Abortion is murder. Homosexuality is sin. We need to call these things what they are and bring the world the true message: that Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life,"" it says on the church's website. It also emphasizes its dislike of Islam, and on its website, it blog posts an item called ""Ten Reasons to Burn a Koran. ""Any religion which would profess anything other than this truth is of the devil. This is why we also take a stand against Islam, which teaches that Jesus is not the Son of God, therefore taking away the saving power of Jesus Christ and leading people straight to Hell,"" the site says. ""It is our vision to go around, to preach and to challenge, and to get the church involved and ready. We must go outside of the walls, and march for righteousness."" Commenting the other day on Jones' critique of Islam, Plemon el-Amin, the imam of an Atlanta, Georgia, mosque, said that his words are ""really quite uninformed."" ""But in America, there is the freedom to be ignorant,"" el-Amin said. ""The only problem is in the world, many people don't understand that particular freedom. So what he is doing is like shouting fire in a theater, in a world theater, and people are upset."" El-Amin said Jones has boasted of never reading the Quran, so, ""He doesn't know that he's going to burn a book that has some of the most beautiful passages about Christ Jesus throughout, as well as Moses, Abraham and all of the prophets he reads about and says he follows in the Bible."" But he said the best strategy would be to ignore Jones, ""like we do people on corners saying the end of the world is coming."" Other religious organizations have joined with U.S. Muslim groups to oppose the Quran-burning. The National Association of Evangelicals is urging the church to cancel the event, warning that it could cause worldwide tension between the two religions, and Christian, Muslim, Jewish and Hindu leaders in Gainesville have organized a ""Gathering for Peace, Understanding and Hope"" the night before the scheduled Quran burning. The U.S. Embassy statement said that in his speech on Islam last year in Cairo, Egypt, President Obama said it is part of his responsibility to fight ""negative stereotypes of Islam,"" and he mentioned interfaith efforts ""to counter this kind of ignorance and misinformation."" ""And during his recent Iftar speech at the White House, he said: Let me be clear: As a citizen, and as president, I believe that Muslims have the same right to practice their religion as anyone else in this country."" In the CNN interview, Jones was asked about the Christian principle of turning the other cheek -- not acting out in violence or engaging in payback and in deed. ""I think in deed that most of the time, we as Christians are indeed called to turn the other cheek. I believe that most of the time, talk and diplomacy is the correct way. But I always think that once in a while, I think you see that in the Bible, there are incidents where enough is enough and you stand up,"" Jones said. An armed Christian organization that had pledged to protect the Dove World Outreach Center withdrew its support from the Quran-burning last week, stating the event ""may diminish the work of the Holy Spirit to witness to Muslims."" That group's founder, Shannon Carson, said he agrees with the church's stance on Islam, which he called a cult ""that is invading our nation."" But he complained that the ""liberal media"" is using stories about Jones' plans ""to distract, divide and enrage the public.""

"As politicians, pundits and the American people are focused on the escalating national crisis at the Department of Veterans Affairs, one excuse for the VA's woes keeps surfacing. Money. The VA, some say, needs more money to do its job and care for veterans properly. But looking at the facts, that math just does not add up. Since 2009, Congress has given Secretary Eric Shinseki every penny he has said he needed to fund the VA fully, resulting in an astonishing 50% increase in the agency's overall budget at a time when budgets everywhere else across the federal government have been squeezed, strained and slashed. Congress even exempted the VA from sequestration, a win that not even the Pentagon managed to score while still engaged in a war overseas. Congress also agreed to take the extraordinary step of giving the VA the annual funding it needs to cover veterans' health care a year in advance so that the agency's hospitals and clinics never run out of money. It is the reason the VA's health care system continued to operate without interruption during last fall's government shutdown, even as parks, federal buildings and congressional offices were forced to close or curtail operations for weeks. A bipartisan coalition of lawmakers in both the House and the Senate, with the strong support of virtually all veteran and military service organizations, has pushed for years to give the VA the rest of its budget a year in advance, too, but the secretary and the Obama administration thus far have refused to endorse publicly the wisdom of protecting the entire VA budget with an advance appropriation. Our gut reaction to contemporary social and bureaucratic challenges may be to throw more money at the problem or to blame Congress, but this is one situation in which such simple excuses fall far short. A lack of resources within the VA is not to blame for the failures of that department, and even if it were, the responsibility for that underfunding would lay solely at the feet of the secretary due to his inadequate budget requests, not with Congress. Far from being underfunded, the VA is facing woes that are clearly due to a failure of planning and leadership. The VA knew or should have known that demand for its services would swell as more troops survived the wars with more severe and chronic injuries, especially mental injuries. And with troop surges and drawdowns debated and planned well in advance, corresponding future demands on the VA system could -- and should -- have been anticipated. Since reports first emerged of veteran deaths during long waits and alleged mismanagement in Phoenix, there continues to be a profound and worrisome lack of thoughtful and proactive leadership coming out of the VA. Instead, the VA has been addressing problems in a predictable manner, first denying their existence, then downplaying the scale, then hunkering down in crisis mode and finally -- and belatedly -- coming forward with a tepid and weak public response. The passive, insular and arms-length management style has proven ill-suited for staying ahead of the pervasive problems of the nation's second-largest bureaucracy. But more importantly, the fear is that such detached leadership from the top may have caused the VA's bureaucratic and administrative pathologies to metastasize. Our nation made a promise to the men and women who served this nation. Tragically, the VA is falling short of this fulfilling this promise. This time, however, we cannot simply spend our way out of accountability and responsibility.

"""My definition of fast food?"" Alice Waters said. ""Letting someone loose in a garden with a bottle of balsamic vinegar and saying, 'have at it.'"" ""(The price of) fast food simply doesn't take account of that meal's true cost -- to soil, oil, public health, the public purse, etc,"" Michael Pollan said. ""Costs which are never charged directly to the consumer but, indirectly and invisibly, to the taxpayer (in the form of subsidies), the health care system (in the form of food-borne illnesses) and obesity, and the environment (in the form of pollution). Not to mention the welfare of the workers in the feedlot and the slaughterhouse and the welfare of the animals themselves."" Both these quotes are explanations of what's wrong with the Western diet, the aesthetic and the socio-ecologic. Both are right on target; both are compelling. Yet both are completely powerless to bring about any sort of change in food policy. Because tastebuds, food-borne illnesses, the environment and animal welfare don't count. Money counts. The food industry continues its juggernaut of revenues and profits. Despite a sales dip at McDonald's, domestic fast food industry revenues have exhibited a 20% rise, adjusted for inflation, over the past decade, according to Statista, a website that aggregates statistics from more than 18,000 sources. That's despite a U.S. population that grew by only 8.4% over the same interval. Fast food was worth $184 billion a year in 2010, up from $165 billion in 2009, and is projected to reach $210 billion in 2016, according to Statista. That pales in comparison to the total revenue of the entire food industry: $1 trillion. The U.S. government has hitched its wagon to the food industry. Our food is the cheapest in the world, made possible in part by federal subsidies to farmers. Yet the United States is the fattest country in the world. OK, then what about obesity and its associated diseases? Shouldn't that get Washington's attention? After all, we annually waste $44 billion on disability, $73 billion in decreased work productivity and $190 billion in health care because of obesity. Add to that a $2,741 increase in personal annual health insurance premiums to cover these costs, even for normal-weight adults. Medicare will be broke by the year 2024. Until we get a handle on obesity, all the Obamacare in the world can't stop the ravages of metabolic syndrome or the resultant health care expenditures. Surely all that money is enough to offset the government's margin on food? Unfortunately in the eyes of politicians, obesity remains an issue of ""personal responsibility."" Don't blame the industry. Just eat less and exercise more, they say. But then how do you explain our epidemic of obese 6-month-olds? They don't diet and exercise. Something more insidious is going on. How about the biochemical explanation? Would that hold any more sway with politicians? Scientific evidence now supports the concept that our glut of sugar -- in particular, the molecule fructose, which is what makes sugar sweet -- can trigger processes that lead to the metabolic syndrome. These include: . -- Hypertension -- fructose increases uric acid, which raises blood pressure. -- High triglycerides and insulin resistance through synthesis of fat in the liver. -- Diabetes via increased liver glucose production combined with insulin resistance. -- The aging process, due to damage to lipids, proteins and DNA through binding of fructose to these molecules. It can be argued that fructose exerts toxic effects on the liver similar to those of alcohol. Furthermore, sugar, like alcohol, has a clear potential for abuse. Sugar acts on the brain to encourage subsequent intake by dampening the suppression of the hunger hormone ghrelin. It also interferes with the hormone leptin, which helps produce a feeling of satiety and reduces dopamine signaling in the brain's reward center, thereby reducing the pleasure derived from food. The majority of foods are laced with added sugar, thus effectively co-opting your choice. Where there's no choice, how can there be personal responsibility? Need more science? How about the lack of fiber in the Western diet, which was removed partially to increase shelf life? Lack of fiber in processed food means rapid absorption and overloading the liver, higher levels of ""bad"" cholesterol, proliferation of obesogenic bacterial species in the intestine, and slower transit of food through the intestine, delaying the onset of the satiety signal. Here's my definition of fast food: fiberless food. Fast cooking (white rice cooks in half the time of brown rice), and fast eating. And fast absorption from the GI tract, overloading the liver, driving insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome, while increasing total food consumption. It's a vicious cycle. So there you have it. A Faustian bargain to be sure: your time or your health; your wallet or your health. Government's job is to generate money. Public health spends money, with the hope of eventually saving money. The food supply has not changed; it has only gotten worse. Public health policies for obesity prevention thus far have not worked, and the president and Congress can't justify spending more money on this. But both the science and the balance sheet say otherwise. Robbing us to pay both Peter and Paul. It's time for government to step up and amend our current food policy — for the aesthetic, for the socio-ecologic and for the biochemical damage that it is doing to America.","The fast food industry continues its revenue and profit, doctor says .

"Hankering to see some happy feet? Antarctica is far from your only option. From the windswept beaches of Tierra del Fuego at South America's tip to sunny Cape Town, South Africa, and Melbourne, Australia, penguin colonies exist in many strikingly beautiful destinations in the Southern Hemisphere. There's no denying it: Penguins are among the most charismatic creatures. Their notorious curiosity, waddling gait and comical body language seldom fail to charm. But these flightless sea birds have evolved over 15 million years to become strong, nimble swimmers that often migrate long distances in pursuit of fish following seasonal ocean currents. 7 prime spots for wildlife viewing . Today, most of the 18 species of penguins are in decline because of climate change, habitat destruction, pollution and overfishing -- in fact, more than half are considered endangered. You can support their survival by visiting carefully managed colonies where tour operators respect penguin habitat and educate visitors about conservation efforts. November through March -- when it's the warmest in the Southern Hemisphere -- is prime time for viewing many penguin species. During the warm season, they spend more time on shore to breed, nest and raise their young. Check out these amazing penguin spots: . Tierra del Fuego (Argentina and Chile) Ushuaia, Argentina, the southernmost city in the world, boasts several tour operators offering day cruises to view penguins and other marine life. But only one, PiraTour, gives visitors the chance to walk among the penguins. PiraTour runs two six-hour tours daily from the port of Ushuaia. Tours are limited to 20 people, so be sure to make reservations well in advance. A 90-minute minivan ride takes visitors through Patagonian forests and along secluded pebbly coves before arriving at Estancia Harberton, a charming family-owned farm and marine center. From there, visitors transfer to a boat for a short ride to Isla Martillo, a research station that monitors the 3,000 pairs of Magellanic penguins and a small colony of gentoo penguins that nest here between September and April. Visitors will spend up to an hour observing the very vocal Magellanic penguins, which bellow and strut along the beach by the hundreds. The tour guide will instruct you to maintain a safe distance from the birds, but be prepared for them to approach you as penguins can be extremely curious. After a few minutes on the beach, you'll be led up a bluff to see their nesting ground, where the birds often return to the same mate and same nest year after year. Back at Estancia Harberton, you'll have time to grab a hot drink at the tea room or explore the farm's on-site marine research center. There is also a guest house and camp sites; contact Harberton directly if you want to extend your visit to this peaceful haven. Otherwise, Ushuaia offers a wide range of accommodation options, from backpacker hostels to luxury hotels perched on glacial mountainsides overlooking the city. PiraTour, U.S. $95 for a six-hour tour (50% discount for children under 12), plus $13 entry fee to Estancia Harberton . Phillip Island, Australia . Since the 1920s, tourists have flocked to Phillip Island to witness the smallest penguin species, known as little penguins or fairy penguins, return to shore each evening to feed their young after a long day of fishing. Only 12 inches tall and weighing less than 3 pounds, the little penguin is found only in Australia and New Zealand. For decades, the penguins on Phillip Island were largely unprotected from the throngs of sightseers, but today most visitors observe the evening penguin ""parade"" from elevated boardwalks and viewing platforms to minimize disturbances to the birds. For those who want a more up-close-and-personal experience, a limited number of tickets are available each day for small group, ranger-guided tours where you can walk among penguins on a secluded beach. The ticket price helps support conservation work on the island, including habitat restoration and research focusing on how penguins are affected by climate change, development and invasive species. Phillip Island is a 90-minute drive from Melbourne, but plan on spending at least a couple of days here to enjoy all its wildlife, including koalas, wallabies, elusive anteaters, seals and whales. Phillip Island Nature Park, prices start at U.S. $23 for evening viewing from a platform, $46 for close-up viewing and $82.50 for a private, ranger-guided ecoadventure in a part of the penguin colony that's closed to the general public. Cape Town, South Africa . The southern tip of Africa offers numerous opportunities to view the African penguin, previously known as the jackass penguin because of its distinctive donkey-like bray. African penguins have declined by 80% in the past 50 years because of pollution, development, climate change and irresponsible tourism activities. The Boulders Beach colony, about 24 miles from Cape Town, was only established in 1983, but it's now an important habitat for the endangered bird. As its name suggests, the beach is strewn with granite boulders, which create an impressive backdrop for photographing the penguins. Today, boardwalk viewing areas help protect the birds from excessive human contact, although you may encounter penguins while swimming and should take care not to approach them if possible. A ride on the wild side in Tanzania . Boulders Beach is part of Table Mountain National Park, situated at the convergence of the Atlantic and Indian oceans on the Cape of Good Hope. Hiking, mountain biking, wind sailing and wildlife viewing are just a few of the activities here that offer impressive views of Cape Town and the surrounding countryside. The nearby village of Simon's Town, with its historic cottages and cobblestone streets, provides numerous accommodation and dining options. Table Mountain National Park, visitors to the park pay a daily conservation fee of U.S. $5.30 per adult and $2.50 per child. Otago Peninsula, New Zealand . Even in a country known for its dramatic scenery and amazing wildlife, the Otago Peninsula stands out. Located on New Zealand's South Island, the peninsula was born of volcanic eruptions that created steep mountains and rugged sea cliffs. It's a hot spot for marine wildlife viewing -- seals, sea lions, elephant seals and, of course, penguins. Here it's possible to see both the little penguin and the rare yellow-eyed penguin. A number of tour operators on the peninsula are committed to environmental education and sustainable ecotourism. Nature Guides Otago offers naturalist-led tours as well as lodging that emphasize sustainability and support penguin habitat restoration and conservation. Another option is Penguin Place, a conservation reserve on a private farm. Visitors begin the tour by learning about penguin conservation efforts before proceeding to a series of trenches and observation huts. From these vantage points, they are treated to up-close views of a yellow-eyed penguin colony while minimizing disturbances to the birds, which live in coastal forests and have suffered significant habitat loss from logging. Nature Guides Otago, a sunrise tour of a yellow-eyed penguin colony, maximum six people, runs U.S. $75 per person.  Nature packages, which include two nights at a B&B cottage, sunrise penguin tour and a daylong tour of the Otago Peninsula, run $540 per person. Note that tour priority is given to those staying at the cottage. Penguin Place, penguin tours run throughout the day. Price is U.S. $41 for adults and $10 for children. Budget accommodations are available at the Penguin Place Lodge for U.S. $22 adults, $8.50 children . Galapagos Islands, Ecuador . It comes as a surprise to most travelers that a trip to the Galapagos could include the chance to see penguins. But in fact, the islands are home to the only penguin that lives in a tropical climate. Unlike other species that migrate according to the season, endangered Galapagos penguins live here year-round, especially in the colder waters of the western islands such as Isla Isabela. Almost any tour of the Galapagos includes the chance to see an incredible variety of wildlife, but some operators specifically offer penguin tours. More likely than not you'll be observing the birds from a boat, but if the tour includes snorkeling in an area frequented by penguins, there's a chance that you could end up swimming with the birds. Southern Exploration, a member of the International Ecotourism Society, is one tour operator that offers the chance to see penguins at close range. However, since the Galapagos National Park Service restricts tourists to specific areas and may limit access depending on conditions, it's best to contact tour operators directly to confirm that you'll be able to see penguins on your trip. Talk through the options carefully with the booking agent to make sure your expectations will be met. Southern Explorations, four to 15-day Galapagos cruising tours with an English-speaking guide, start at around U.S. $3,000 up to about $6,000, including the flight from Quito to the Galapagos. Ask to speak to a Galapagos expert and tell them you are interested in seeing penguins so they can find an appropriate tour during your travel dates. Avoid holiday travel unless you book a year or more in advance -- tours around Christmas and Easter fill up fast.","November through March is prime season for penguin viewing .

"Comedian David Brenner, a regular on Johnny Carson's ""The Tonight Show,"" has died after a battle with cancer, a family spokesman said Saturday. He was 78. Brenner was a staple on Carson's late-night show, appearing more times than any other guest -- 158, according to a bio on his official website. Before getting into comedy, Brenner helped write, produce and direct 115 TV documentaries, earning him nearly 30 awards. Brenner also was the author of five books -- his latest published in 2003, ""I Think There's a Terrorist in My Soup."" Even in death, he kept the jokes coming. Brenner's final request, according to family spokesman Jeff Abraham, was to have $100 in small bills tucked in his sock -- ""just in case tipping is recommended where I'm going."" His gravesite will read: ""If this is supposed to be a joke -- then I don't get it!,"" according to Abraham. Comedian Joan Rivers, a longtime friend of Brenner's, tweeted about the news of his passing Saturday. ""RIP David Brenner. I adored him, and laughed more with him than anybody. Sad, sad, sad.

"Thousands of people paid their last respects to Israel's former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon Sunday as his body lay in state outside the nation's parliament. ""He was one of the giants. He was very special,"" said Ayala Weisel, who said she grew up learning of Sharon as a widely admired soldier who fought for his country. She was one of many mourners who shared memories with CNN on Sunday of Sharon, the towering military and political leader who died Saturday after eight years in a coma. Chaim Friedman, a tour guide, described Sharon as a great leader. ""He was known as the bulldozer because he got his way and he made things happen. He's well respected for that,"" Friedman said. ""Sometimes in Israel, you have to do it the straight way, or you have to find the other way to get things done, and he managed to do it."" Blake Fleisher of New York said he admired Sharon for disobeying orders and doing what he thought was right in 1973 during the Yom Kippur War. Sharon's decision to lead 200 tanks and 5,000 men over the Suez Canal was a turning point in the war. ""He moved the tanks in a different way than he was commanded to do, and that's what saved the state of Israel, and that's why so many people are here today,"" Fleisher said. A state memorial ceremony for Sharon is planned for Monday. World leaders, including U.S. Vice President Joe Biden and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, will attend the memorial, which will be followed by a funeral procession. The procession will include a stop in Latrun for a special meeting of the Israel Defense Forces and will end with a military funeral at Sharon's Shikmim Ranch. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described Sharon as a warrior and a political leader. ""The state of Israel bows its head on the passing of former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon,"" Netanyahu said in a statement Sunday. ""Ariel Sharon played a central role in the struggle for the security of the State of Israel over all its years."" But others painted a darker picture of Sharon's legacy. And the same decisions that made Sharon a controversial figure during his lengthy tenure as a military man and politician were back on display in the initial reactions to his death. These moments include his role as defense minister during the 1982 war in Lebanon. During that conflict, he was held indirectly responsible by an Israeli inquiry in 1983 for the massacre of hundreds of Palestinians at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps. He was forced to resign. He also raised ire in the Arab world by encouraging Israelis to build settlements on occupied Palestinian land, but later did an about-face and pushed for the historic withdrawal from settlements in the West Bank and Gaza, which were turned over to Palestinian rule for the first time in nearly four decades. READ MORE: Sharon's life on the front lines . President Shimon Peres made an address eulogizing his ""dear friend Arik Sharon,"" calling him by his well-known nickname. ""He was an outstanding man and an exceptional commander who moved his people and loved them. And the people loved him,"" Peres said. But Hamas, the Palestinian movement that runs Gaza, painted Sharon with a darker legacy. ""We deal with the death of Sharon as an end for the crimes he committed against the Palestinian people,"" said Isra Almodallal, spokeswoman for Hamas in Gaza. ""The biggest crime was the Sabra and Shatila massacre in Lebanon, and we deal with Sharon as a criminal person. ""We will not forgive Sharon any way or another,"" she said. At the Baddawi refugee camp in northern Lebanon, Sharon's death was marked with long bursts of shooting into the air, the Lebanese state-run NNA news agency reported. READ MORE: Five things to know about Sharon . U.S. President Barack Obama offered condolences to Sharon and the Israeli people. But his statement did not single out any milestones in the late prime minister's life for praise besides noting that Sharon dedicated his life to Israel. ""We continue to strive for lasting peace and security for the people of Israel, including through our commitment to the goal of two states living side-by-side in peace and security,"" Obama said. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry offered a nuanced statement. ""During his years in politics, it is no secret that there were times the United States had differences with him. But whether you agreed or disagreed with his positions -- and Arik was always crystal clear about where he stood -- you admired the man who was determined to ensure the security and survival of the Jewish State."" To make Israel stronger, Sharon recognized that peace is necessary, Kerry said. Sharon was involved in every Israeli war dating to 1948, and he was remembered as a fierce fighter. He believed strongly that in order for Israel to survive, a strong army was needed. He had a reputation as a hawk, but he moved in a more moderate direction as prime minister. The office of U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon released a statement focusing on his shift toward negotiations with the Palestinians. Sharon ""will be remembered for his political courage and determination to carry through with the painful and historic decision to withdraw Israeli settlers and troops from the Gaza Strip.  His successor faces the difficult challenge of realizing the aspirations of peace between the Israeli and Palestinian people,"" the statement said. French President Francois Hollande offered his condolences, also emphasizing Sharon's actions at the end of his career. ""After a long military and political career, he made the choice to turn towards dialogue with the Palestinians,"" Hollande said in a statement. The reaction from Russian President Vladimir Putin was less specific and, overall, laudatory for Sharon's contributions to Israel and toward fostering Israeli-Russian relations. ""The President of Russia highly praised Ariel Sharon's personal qualities, his activity to uphold the interests of Israel, noting the respect he enjoyed among his compatriots and internationally,"" the Kremlin said in a statement. Critics continued to evoke the 1982 war in Lebanon. ""It's a shame that Sharon has gone to his grave without facing justice for his role in Sabra and Shatila and other abuses,"" said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. ""His passing is another grim reminder that years of virtual impunity for rights abuses have done nothing to bring Israeli-Palestinian peace any closer."" Khaled Abu Al Noor, head of the Democratic Front, a Palestinian faction, described Sharon as ""a murderer."" ""He is responsible for the massacre of many Palestinian children, women and elderly. We call on the international community to try him under international law even after his death."" Sharon's son, Gilad, thanked the people who cared for his father in the hospital and those who prayed for him. ""He was the one who decided when he would go,"" Gilad said.","""He was one of the giants,"" one mourner says .

"A millionaire British businessman accused of hiring hit men to kill his new wife during their honeymoon in South Africa pleaded not guilty as his trial began Monday. Shrien Dewani, 34, has denied orchestrating the killing of his wife, Anni, in Cape Town in November 2010. The slaying took place during a taxi ride through a township on the edge of the South African city, just over two weeks after the couple's wedding. The taxi driver, Zola Tongo, confessed within weeks of the bride's death that he had hired two men to kill her. In a plea deal with South African authorities, he said he was paid by Dewani to carry out the murder and to make it look as though the couple were the victims of a carjacking. Tongo was subsequently sentenced to 18 years in prison for his part in the killing. His two accomplices are also serving lengthy sentences for their role in the crime. Family hoping for answers . The victim's family say they are relieved that Dewani is now going on trial in Cape Town. ""Hopefully, we will get all the answers we want,"" her uncle Ashok Hindocha said Sunday, according to local media reports. Dewani, a care home owner, had returned to the United Kingdom after his wife's death. He avoided extradition to South Africa on mental health grounds during a three-year court battle, but was eventually sent back in April to face trial. What's life like in a South African prison? Psychiatric experts had said that he was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and depression and that he'd tried to take his life. Before his extradition, he was held at a secure mental health unit in southwest England. But in August, he was declared fit to stand trial after undergoing psychiatric observation, according to South African media. An indictment in the case said he faces charges including conspiracy to commit kidnapping, robbery with aggravating circumstances, murder and kidnapping, the South African Press Association reported. Dewani, from Bristol in southwest England, has said his wife was the victim of a carjacking and denies any involvement in the killing.","Shrien Dewani is accused of masterminding the slaying of his wife in Cape Town .

"Brazil, a leading critic of American spying, appeared caught in a bind when a news report claimed that the South American giant conducted espionage of its own. But there is no hypocrisy here, the Brazilian government says, even as it defends its own snooping by using the same arguments the United States has espoused. ""I see the situations as completely different,"" Brazilian Justice Minister Jose Eduardo Cardozo told Folha de Sao Paulo, the newspaper that broke the story of Brazil's spying, in comments reported Tuesday. Europe falls out of love with Obama over NSA spying claims . What the NSA is accused of doing to Brazil and other countries is a breach of secrecy, he said. ""That is interception of data, interceptions of phone calls. Intercepts that affront Brazil's sovereignty,"" he said. What Brazil did was engage in counterespionage measures that are allowed under its law, the minister said. Based on reports, the type of spying Brazil engaged in pales in comparison with what the United States is accused of. Mexico to summon U.S. ambassador over spying allegations . Diplomatic relations between the the United States and Brazil were strained after leaked documents claimed that the U.S. National Security Agency spied on Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff and her aides. In the wake of the NSA scandal, Brazil postponed a state visit to the United States, and Brazil and Germany were drafting a United Nations resolution on privacy in electronic communication. The twist came last week, when Folha de Sao Paulo revealed that Brazil itself spied on foreign diplomats inside Brazil in 2003 and 2004. Its targets included officials from Russia, Iran and the United States. On Monday, Brazil's Institutional Security Cabinet, which overseas intelligence gathering, admitted that it had spied but defended its actions. Not only did the spying take place 10 years ago, but it took place within the bounds of Brazilian laws to protect national interests, the government said in a statement. While respecting the freedom of the press in Brazil, it is a crime to leak classified information, and those responsible for the leak will be prosecuted, the statement said. These statements echo U.S. arguments that it acted within its legal framework and that the U.S. leaker, Edward Snowden, should face criminal charges. Cordozo gave a third argument in defense of the Brazilian spying, which also sounds familiar: that every country engages in this type of activity. The difference, he told Folha de Sao Paulo, is that Brazil's spying did not violate anyone's rights or sovereignty. ""This seems to me a very crucial difference,"" he said. ""If we don't make that distinction, it gives the impression that what we are using the same method that we are criticizing. That is not the case.""

"Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands (CNN) -- Whether he's out on the ocean monitoring stingrays in the Caribbean, or back on land painting in his studio, Guy Harvey spends all his time surrounded by fish. Raised in Jamaica and educated in Scotland, Harvey is one of the world's leading conservationists with a first class degree in marine biology and a PhD in fisheries management. His love of the sea and ecology inspired Harvey to found the Guy Harvey Research Institute in 1999 which provides scientific information about fish protection and biodiversity. But this is only half of Harvey's remarkable story. He is a highly successful businessman with a chain of seafood restaurants and a self-taught artist whose depictions of game fish have become world famous. ""I didn't go to art class or art school, never took a lesson in my life. I learned everything from trial and error and it's this persistence, I suppose, with the illustrative content which got me to where I am,"" Harvey told CNN. Ernest Hemmingway's novella, ""The Old Man and the Sea"" inspired Harvey's obsession with game fish and moved him to depict the famous fishing story in a series of pen and ink drawings a quarter of a century ago. He paints every day and 10 percent of the proceeds of all the paintings he sells goes straight back into his eco-organizations. Harvey also created a TV series, ""Portraits of the Deep,"" to showcase game fish and their importance to the environment. ""To see them underwater in their glowing, feeding and moving colors, their aggression colors are probably one of the most exciting things you can do as a diver,"" Harvey said. These videos play constantly in his stores and his restaurants where Harvey's art is also on the walls, and only sustainable fish species are on the menu. Harvey's marine expertise has also helped to pioneer techniques of recording billfish underwater and a tagging system to monitor them over long distances. More recently, he's taken on the plight of sharks. Hunted for their fins, the loss of these predators could affect the oceans' fragile balance. Harvey's recent Ultimate Shark Challenge was a catch-and-release fishing tournament held off the Southwest Florida coast. Endangered sharks were tagged for study and not a single one was strung up in the dock. Sharks are also in danger in the Gulf of Mexico because of the BP oil leak. Harvey fears other fish are at risk too. He's planning a new line of t-shirts to raise funds for research. ""We have no idea when this is going to stop or how far it's going to reach and what the life span of this disaster is going to be,"" Harvey said. From the study of stingrays, to the most pressing conservation issues in global fisheries, the diver, artist, scientist, and businessman is always promoting the preservation of marine ecology. ""Fish are just stinking fish to most people. They have their filet that comes on the plate or you buy it in the fish mongers and it comes in a cellophane bag and it's dead and cold and smelly. These are beautiful graceful ocean predators that need our respect. ""I want to leave people feeling that, you know, we really need to think more about how we use the ocean and everything that's in it and if I've achieved that, then that will do it for me.""","Guy Harvey has dedicated his adult life to the study and preservation of marine life .

"The discovery of three young women missing for a decade in Cleveland immediately raised the hopes of the family of a fourth missing woman. After all, Ashley Summers was just like two of the three discovered women: Cleveland teenagers who all disappeared within five blocks of each other over a four-year span. The anticipation for Summers' family was heightened momentarily when authorities said they had yet to identify one of the three discovered women. Was it Ashley? Could it be Ashley, who went missing almost six years ago at age 14? ""At first, when they said the third girl wasn't identified, I was hoping one would be Ashley,"" said her aunt, Debra Summers. Ashley Summers' mother expressed similar emotions. ""She said, 'Oh, my God' -- just hoping it was Ashley,"" Debra Summers, 30, said of her sister Jennifer Summers, 33, who wasn't immediately available for interviews Tuesday. But the third woman held in captivity for a decade was someone else, not Ashley, authorities announced. ""I was upset, but I was happy at the same time that they found the third girl,"" Debra Summers said. Now the Summers family is hoping that the investigation into the three women's decade-long captivity will yield information about Ashley, who disappeared on July 6, 2007. ""We're hoping that it's connected, and they knew where she was,"" Summers said of the investigation. ""We're hoping for a miracle."" Investigators questioned three brothers about Summers, but police said Wednesday they had no new leads. Only one brother, Ariel Castro, will be charged in the kidnappings, police said. ""There is no new information that's come to light about her: Ashley Summers is an active, open investigation,"" Cleveland Police Deputy Chief Ed Tomba told reporters Wednesday. ""I can assure you that her disappearance was part of our questioning of the three subjects that we brought in."" Investigators will speak to the three discovered women to see if they know anything about Summers' disappearance, said Special Agent Vicki Anderson, of the FBI Cleveland Division. The discovery of the three women might prompt someone who has information -- but never said anything -- to call authorities, she said. ""We're really very dependent on the public's assistance on things such as this, for them to be aware of people around them, to report things that are suspicious, to take a look at the pictures of these individuals who are missing and see if they recognize them,"" Anderson said. Since Ashley Summers disappeared, ""there's been no legitimate sightings, no accessing social media, anything,"" Anderson said. Former FBI agent Jennifer Eakin said authorities have long believed in a link in the disappearances of Summers and two of the women discovered this week -- Amanda Berry and Georgina ""Gina"" DeJesus. Eakin is now a case manager at the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, which in 2008 held a comprehensive review of the cases with the FBI and Cleveland police. ""We did in fact believe there was an association between the Berry case and the DeJjesus case as well as the Summers case,"" Eakin said. In 2009, CNN reported how the FBI was investigating connections between the three missing Cleveland teens. ""We kind of put all three of these cases together to work them to see if there's any connection,"" FBI Special Agent Scott Wilson, in the agency's Cleveland Division, said then. At the time, authorities said Ashley Summers was initially reported as a runaway after a family argument. Problem was, she never contacted her family again, authorities said. ""She's considered an endangered juvenile who may have been a runaway and possibly abducted,"" Anderson said. The Summers family is also renewing their efforts to publicize Ashley's disappearance. The FBI's missing person website says Ashley Summers has a tattoo of ""Gene"" enclosed in a heart on her upper arm, and her birthday is June 16, 1993, making her 19 years old. Jennifer Summers, a restaurant cook, has seven other children, whose ages range from 2 to 16, and Ashley is her oldest, said Debra Summers, a shipping clerk who lives in Parma, Ohio. Debra Summers last saw her niece two weeks before she disappeared. ""She just hanged around the house and talked about her boyfriend and the usual stuff,"" Debra Summers said. ""She actually wanted to move in with me, and I said yeah, but she never came."" Ashley Summers left her mother's home, where four younger siblings were then also living, and instead moved to her great-uncle's residence, so she could be closer to friends, Debra Summers said. Then she vanished.","Police questioning of brothers yields no leads in Summers' disappearance .

"(CNN) -- Speculation has been rampant over what exactly has happened to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. After all, Kim hasn't been seen in public in over a month, and the country's media took the unusual step of admitting that Kim is in an ""uncomfortable physical condition."" Some commentators believe this suggests Kim might be more seriously ill than the country is letting on. But others have speculated something more dramatic might have occurred -- namely a coup. Does the evidence back this up? The short answer is, no. For a start, there have been no unusual military or troop movements inside North Korea, particularly tied to the Pyongyang defense command or other key military units. On top of this, just this past weekend, Hwang Pyong-so -- political director for the Korean People's Army, and widely seen as the second most powerful man in North Korea -- and former KPA political director Choe Ryong-hae made a surprise visit to South Korea for the end of the Asian Games. The visiting officials brought with them a surprise: an informal offer from Kim to immediately resume high-level talks between North and South Korea. It is difficult to imagine that a regime facing an intense internal crisis or power struggle would dispatch two top political and military figures to South Korea, and make an offer in Kim's name, if there really were a silent power struggle going on back in Pyongyang. Finally, it was reported that all the achievements of the North Korean athletes at the recently concluded games were attributed to Kim, with lectures given to workers on October 4 titled ""The faith and consideration of Marshal Kim Jong Un for the athletes and workers."" Clearly, the regime is still placing Kim at the center of its propaganda. Is Kim Jong Un's sister in charge? Absent any sort of evidence of military upheaval or unusual political activity, the only way this could be a coup is if it were completely invisible, a very unusual sort of coup indeed. True, talk of coups against successive Kim regimes has been a staple of North Korea-watching for decades. But the legitimacy of North Korea's rulers has been centered on the Kim family since the country was founded, some seven decades ago. A coup would therefore not only have to physically replace Kim, but provide some sort of justification and legitimation for such action to the North Korean people. The role of the Kim family in North Korea is typically misunderstood as a ""cult of personality,"" but the reality is more complex than that. In fact, one reason the North Korean regime has proved so durable is that it is grafted onto deep Korean social and cultural roots. In contrast to many other communist regimes that attempted to wipe away the past, the North Korean regime built its legitimacy on the basic idea that Kim Il Sung is the ""true"" Korean, the only defender of the Korean nation from its enemies. Is Kim Jong Un still in charge of North Korea? With this view in mind, the Kim family did not try to wipe out many of the existing cultural or social features of Korean life, but instead embraced them (in an admittedly warped way). For example, the Korean Worker's Party adopted the Confucian scholar's brush -- perhaps the most obvious representation of traditional Korea -- as part of its official iconography. The party also encouraged its women to wear traditional Korean dress as often as possible, another link to its past. But most important of all has been the use of the traditional Korean extended family as the basis of North Korean political rule. Korea is a clan-based, familial society, and Kim Il Sung simply melded himself -- and his son and grandson -- onto the entire country as patriarch. Kim's son and grandson have continued this patriarchal approach: Activities such as ""on the scene guidance,"" and other personal interventions by Kim have emphasized the personal link between the Kim family and their citizens. Of course this effort at legitimation is warped and repressive. But it has also resonated with many North Koreans. All this suggests that while internal collapse is quite possible -- even likely -- if the Kim family itself should come apart, a coup by someone outside the family appears unlikely to succeed. Kim's absence from celebrations marking the founding of the Korean Worker's Party on October 10 would certainly raise eyebrows. But right now, without any kind of concrete evidence, speculation that there might have been a coup looks misplaced. Kim may be sick or even have had surgery. But he is also almost certainly still in power.","North Korean leader Kim Jong Un hasn't appeared in public for over a month .

"Israel is fighting to block rockets from striking its major population centers, deploying its Iron Dome missile defense system to intercept them. By Wednesday afternoon, since the start of Operation Protective Edge, the Israel Defense Forces said missiles from the system had intercepted 56 rockets fired out of Gaza, preventing strikes in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Kiryat Gat and elsewhere. More than 250 rockets have been fired out of Gaza toward Israel in that time, the IDF said. Israel uses the Iron Dome system only against rockets headed toward populated areas. If one appears to be headed for an empty field, the dome does not activate. The system is a centerpiece of Israel's defense strategy. How does it work? The name Iron Dome evokes an image of a protective bubble over a city. In practice, it targets incoming rockets and fires an interceptor missile to destroy them in the air. Each battery has a firing-control radar to identify targets. It also has a portable missile launcher. The system is easily transportable, with just a few hours needed to relocate and set up. The missile is highly maneuverable. It is 3 meters, or almost 10 feet, long; has a diameter of about 6 inches (15 centimeters); and weighs 90 kilograms, or 198 pounds, the security analysis group IHS Jane's said in 2012. The warhead is believed to carry 11 kilograms, or 24 pounds, of high explosives, IHS Jane's said. Its range is from 4 kilometers to 70 kilometers, or 2½ miles to 43 miles. Iron Dome confronts multiple threats simultaneously, in all weather conditions, the military said. Israel credits ""breakthrough technology"" and the system's radar. ""The radar detects a rocket launch and passes information regarding its path to the control center, which calculates the predicted point of impact,"" the IDF said. ""If this location justifies an interception, a missile is fired to intercept the rocket. The payload of the interceptor missile explodes near the rocket, in a place that is not expected to cause injuries."" What are the origins? Israel began developing the ground-based system in 2007. After a series of test flights in 2008 and 2009, the first deployment of a battery occurred in southern Israel in 2011. The Israel Air Force reported an interception success rate of 70% in 2011, IHS Jane's said. Is the United States involved in Iron Dome? Yes. The initial development was solely by Israel's defense technology company Rafael, but the system has since been heavily sponsored by the United States. In 2014, the United States provided $235 million for Iron Dome research, development and production, according to the Congressional Research Service. ""This is a program that has been critical in terms of providing security and safety for Israeli families,"" President Obama has said of Iron Dome. ""It is a program that has been tested and has prevented missile strikes inside of Israel."" Each Iron Dome battery costs $50 million, IHS Jane's said. A missile costs at least $62,000, Israeli officials said. Other countries have expressed interest in buying the system, including the United States, South Korea and several NATO countries in Europe with military forces in Afghanistan, The Jerusalem Post has reported.","Israel uses the Iron Dome system only against rockets headed toward populated areas .

"Hailey, Idaho (CNN) -- The FBI is investigating threats against the parents of Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, the latest development in a case that has put the spotlight on the circumstances surrounding his capture in Afghanistan and release by the Taliban. ""We are working jointly with our state and local partners and taking each threat seriously,"" FBI Special Agent William Facer told CNN in an e-mail on Saturday. Facer declined to detail the nature and severity of the threats, and a military spokesperson for the Bergdahls declined to comment. Bergdahl's parents have not been seen publicly since the announcement last week that the soldier had been freed from five years in captivity at the hands of the Taliban in exchange for the release of five detainees at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base. Bergdahl's release raises questions . The news comes as a fallen soldier's mother and a former member of Bergdahl's unit continued to assert that troops were killed while searching for the soldier in eastern Afghanistan. Pentagon and Army officials have looked at such claims, and ""right now there is no evidence to back that up,"" a U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, has told CNN. But former Sgt. Matt Vierkant, a member of Bergdahl's platoon, told CNN's Michael Smerconish that ""men were injured and killed in the search for him."" ""The mission was to find Bergdahl,"" Vierkant said. In the week since Bergdahl was released by the Taliban, a controversy has grown over whether troops were killed, directly or indirectly, in the search. Former soldiers involved in the operations asserted to CNN this week that at least six soldiers were killed in the search for Bergdahl. The six soldiers at the center of the Bergdahl debate . How did 6 die after Bowe Bergdahl's disappearance? Also making claims of troop deaths in the Bergdahl search is Sondra Andrews, the mother of 2nd Lt. Darryn Andrews, who was killed in September 2009. She endorsed accusations by former unit members that Bergdahl deserted and caused U.S. troops to die in the search for him -- though Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has said it's ""unfair"" to Bergdahl and his family to presume anything about his disappearance. Andrews said she believes her son and other troops ""were strictly on a mission looking for Bergdahl."" That information is ""based on the men that served with Darryn,"" she told Smerconish. Andrews said that military should give her family information ""on what Darryn was doing and why they lied to us."" ""I'd like to see Bergdahl given an opportunity to tell his story, be on trial, have the witnesses come forward and tell their story and get the truth through that, and then I would like to see the full measure of the law followed for his punishment,"" Andrews said. Watch: Obama defends Bergdahl swap . Bergdahl went missing on June 30, 2009, in Afghanistan's Paktika province, where he was deployed with the 1st Battalion, 501st Infantry Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division. An Army fact-finding investigation conducted in the months after his disappearance concluded that Bergdahl left his outpost deliberately and of his own free will, according to the official, who was briefed on the report. The Army has no definitive finding that Bergdahl deserted because that would require knowing his intent -- something Army officials couldn't learn without talking to the soldier, a U.S. military official told CNN.

"(CNN) -- A Utah judge Tuesday sentenced polygamist sect leader Warren Jeffs to two consecutive prison terms of five years to life for his conviction on two counts of being an accomplice to rape, a court spokeswoman said. Warren Jeffs listens to closing defense arguments during his trial in St. George, Utah, in September. The consecutive sentences mean Jeffs will serve at least 10 years. The exact amount of time he serves will be determined by the Utah Board of Pardons and Parole in the future. Jeffs, 51, the ""prophet"" of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, or FLDS, was convicted in September. He was accused of using his religious influence over his followers to coerce a 14-year-old girl into marriage to her 19-year-old cousin. Fifth District Judge James Shumate ordered that Jeffs be remanded immediately to the Utah State Prison near Salt Lake City, and fined him about $38,000.   Watch the judge sentence Jeffs » . Jeffs will receive credit for time served, Shumate said. The girl, Elissa Wall, now 21, testified that she repeatedly told Jeffs at the time that she did not want to be married and was uncomfortable with sexual advances from her husband, Allen Steed. Jeffs advised her to pray and to submit to her husband, learn to love him and bear his children -- or risk losing her ""eternal salvation,"" the woman testified. Wall's attorneys made her name public at the end of the trial, with her consent.  She is married to someone else and has left the FLDS. Questioned by Shumate during Tuesday's sentencing hearing, Wall maintained she did not seek restitution from Jeffs. ""My restitution is knowing that I spoke the truth, and you and the justice system have done your job, and I respect that very much, and I have faith and confidence that you will continue the healing process for me,"" she told the judge. Offered the opportunity to speak, Jeffs did not. He showed no reaction as the sentence was imposed. In sentencing Jeffs, Shumate noted that 14 is under the legal marriage age in Utah and said Jeffs knew the marriage was unlawful. ""First cousins of this age cannot marry lawfully in the state of Utah,"" he said. He also denied a motion filed November 9 by Jeffs' defense attorneys asking him to set aside the jury's verdict. ""A reasonable juror could not have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt from the state's purely circumstantial evidence that Jeffs encouraged another to rape Elissa Wall,"" the motion said. Defense attorney Wally Bugden told Shumate he intends to appeal. ""We intend to do everything we can to reverse the verdict,"" Bugden told reporters after the hearing. ""We do not believe the facts and the law support the charge of accomplice to rape."" See a timeline of events leading up to the sentencing » . Two weeks ago, Shumate unsealed court documents indicating that Jeffs tried to hang himself while he was awaiting trial in January. The documents, released at the request of the media, also indicated that Jeffs confessed to ""immorality"" with a ""sister"" and a daughter more than 30 years ago. The FLDS calls adult women ""sister,"" so Jeffs' meaning is unclear. Jeffs' attorneys said in a motion opposing the unsealing of the statements that their client recanted them the following month. Defense attorneys claim Jeffs' medical condition influenced his state of mind when he made those statements. Members of the FLDS, based in the side-by-side border towns of Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Arizona, openly practice polygamy. Jeffs, who is considered a prophet by his followers, has led the 10,000-member sect since his father's death in 2002. The FLDS is not affiliated with the mainstream Mormon church, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He has drawn critical attention to the FLDS by allegedly arranging marriages to girls as young as 13, exiling male teens and young men to reduce competition for brides, and reassigning the wives and children of excommunicated male followers. Jeffs, who was once on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list, was captured in Nevada in August 2006 after two years on the run. In addition to the Utah charges, he also faces multiple counts in Arizona of being an accomplice to incest and sex with minors.

"Cardiologists and other doctors already view artery-clogging red meat as a villain, and they now have another reason to urge their patients to steer clear: A new study has found that men have a higher risk of developing aggressive prostate cancer if they consume a lot of ground beef and other red meat -- especially if the meat is grilled or well-done. The men in the study who ate about two servings of hamburger or meat loaf per week were more than twice as likely to have been diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer as the men who ate none. But most of that increase in risk can be attributed to how the meat was cooked. When the researchers looked only at the members of the burger-loving group who ate their meat grilled or barbecued, the numbers told a different story: The men who preferred their burgers well-done had double the cancer risk, while those who liked them medium (or rarer) had a negligible increase in risk -- just 12 percent. A similar pattern was seen with grilled or barbecued steak. Health.com: What men need to know about prostate-specific antigen (PSA) tests . ""This is another piece of evidence for the notion that red meat, particularly grilled meat, contains carcinogens that may relate to prostate cancer,"" says Ronald D. Ennis, M.D., director of radiation oncology at St. Luke's -- Roosevelt Hospital Center, in New York City, who was not involved in the study. When meat is cooked -- and charred -- at high temperatures over an open flame, a reaction occurs that causes the formation of two chemicals: heterocyclic amines (HCAs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). In animal studies, these chemicals have been shown to cause several types of cancer, including prostate cancer. Although by now it is well established that red meat increases the risk of heart disease and colorectal cancer, its role in prostate cancer has been less clear. Numerous studies have investigated a possible link between meat consumption and prostate-cancer risk, but the results have been inconsistent. Health.com: How to prevent colorectal cancer . ""This study not only associates red meat with a risk of prostate cancer but it takes it a little bit forward by looking at the method of cooking and the degree of cooking,"" says Lee Richstone, M.D., an associate professor of surgery and a prostate-cancer specialist at the Smith Institute of Urology, in New Hyde Park, N.Y. ""It helps contribute to our understanding of a potential mechanism in the form of [HCAs] and [PAHs]."" In the study, which was published this week in the journal PLoS One, researchers at the University of California, San Francisco compared about 500 men who recently had been diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer to a cancer-free group of similar size who served as controls. All of the participants filled out detailed questionnaires about their diets over the previous year, including the amount of meat they ate and how it was prepared. Men who ate the most ground beef were 2.3 times more likely than men who ate none to have aggressive prostate cancer. Higher consumption of fatty lunchmeats (such as salami) and liver was also associated with an increase in cancer risk. On the other hand, poultry, bacon, and low-fat hot dogs and sausages appeared to have little influence on cancer risk. Health.com: The best and worst hot dogs for your health . The study ""certainly supports the notion that these types of foods may be harmful in some ways,"" Ennis says. Close to one-fifth of U.S. men will at some point in their lives develop prostate cancer, which ranges in severity from benign tumors that need little or no treatment to very aggressive forms that are usually deadly. Age, family history, and genetics all have been shown to increase risk. The evidence for environmental risk factors -- including diet -- is less clear, though researchers have long suspected they play a role because of the wide geographical variation in prostate-cancer rates. The study is far from airtight. The data on meat consumption relied on the memory of the participants, for instance. And although the researchers took into account several known risk factors for prostate cancer (such as family history, smoking, and body mass index), it's possible that other unidentified factors contributed to the apparent link between meat consumption and cancer risk. Still, the findings are compelling enough that men should consider exercising ""moderation and caution,"" Richstone says. ""There's an expanding and building body of literature that does point to this type of connection, and I think papers like this make for a stronger and stronger argument that men need to moderate their intake of highly cooked meat,"" he says.","In the study, men who preferred their burgers well-done had double the cancer risk .

"Aimee Copeland was spending her first night at home Wednesday since flesh-eating bacteria forced the amputation of her hands, leg and foot three months ago. Copeland's first stop out of rehab was to Longhorn Steakhouse for lunch with her family, said her father, Andy. She then went to her parents' house in Snellville, Georgia, and relaxed with her sister, Paige, watching Comedy Central while their parents went shopping. Wednesday night, she will settle into a specially outfitted wing of her parents' home that was built just for her and donated by a local homebuilder. Father: Aimee Copeland using new prosthetics . The 24-year-old University of West Georgia graduate student was out with friends May 1 at the Little Tallapoosa River, about 50 miles west of Atlanta, when the homemade zip line she was holding snapped. She fell and got a gash in her leg that required 22 staples to close. Three days later, still in pain, she went to an emergency room, and doctors eventually determined she had necrotizing fasciitis caused by the flesh-devouring bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila. Doctors had to carry out the amputations in order to save her life. Copeland spent two months in an Augusta, Georgia, hospital before moving to rehab July 2. Andy Copeland said Wednesday his daughter ""loves"" the 1,956-foot wing that was built for her. Pulte Homes, which constructed the addition, says the wing includes a living room, bedroom and bathroom along with a fitness room, sunroom, study room and three outdoor areas. Andy Copeland: 'I have become a better father because of Aimee' The wing also includes access ramps, an elevator, guide rails in the bathroom and a separate wash sink Copeland can use to clean her new prosthetics. Copeland has been working hard on her rehabilitation, determined to live as independently as possible, her father says. The tough regimen requires 200 crunches in seven minutes, 400 leg lifts in seven minutes, and ""an untold number of push-ups and something else that she calls 'planks' and 'sideplanks.' "" On his blog, Andy Copeland related his daughter's reaction when he told her he was getting a van with a wheelchair lift. Aimee wanted no part of it, he wrote. She wants to drive herself around in a Prius. ""The simple fact is that between her ears, Aimee is 100%,"" he wrote. ""She knows that she can accomplish anything she wants and that lacking the hands or feet to accomplish such tasks is only a minor inconvenience."" Explained: Necrotizing fasciitis . A number of bacteria that are common in the environment but rarely cause serious infections can lead to necrotizing fasciitis, or flesh-eating bacteria syndrome. When the bacteria get into the bloodstream, such as through a cut, doctors typically move aggressively to excise even healthy tissue near the infection site in hopes of ensuring none of the dangerous bacteria remain. The infection attacks and destroys healthy tissue and is fatal about 20% of the time, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Dr. William Schaffner, chairman of the Department of Preventive Medicine at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, estimates that fewer than 250 such cases occur each year in the United States, though estimates are imprecise since doctors do not have to report the cases to health authorities. Family counters struggle with faith .","Aimee Copeland contracted the bacteria in early May when her zip line broke .

"Paris (CNN)French authorities knew alarming details about two of the terrorists in the Paris attack as recently as a year ago, according to court documents obtained by CNN. The documents show that Amedy Coulibaly and Cherif Kouachi were close associates and go into explicit detail on how the two Paris attackers plotted to stage a prison break to free a fellow terrorist in 2010. Coulibaly, who is accused of killing a French police officer and killing four more people at a kosher grocery store, was described as a logistics expert in charge of accumulating weapons and arms for the prison break plot. Records show when he was arrested in 2010, police found ""a huge cache of high-caliber arms,"" including 240 cartridges for machine guns for ""the specific goal of seriously hurting people through intimidation or terror acts."" Police also found computers with security and encryption and recipes for poison purportedly capable of killing a million people. Cherif Kouachi, accused of killing 12 people after attacking the Charlie Hebdo magazine last week with his brother, was implicated in the prison plot, but he denied involvement and was not jailed for that. Kouachi and Coulibaly had a mentor in common, a radical named Djamel Beghal. Once known as al Qaeda's premiere European recruiter, Beghal was convicted of conspiring to attack the U.S. Embassy in Paris. Kouachi had met Beghal in prison, and once they were freed, he would visit him with Coulibaly, bringing Beghal food and money -- and sometimes spending days at his apartment. Also part of the visits was Coulibaly's partner, Hayat Boumeddiene, who's now on the run and wanted by police. Court documents detail how Kouachi and Coulibaly plotted together, hiding their conversations by using code names over disposable cell phones. But what about Beghal? Does he have any direct connection to last week's attacks? And what happened to him? Beghal was first arrested in Dubai in 2001 for his role in the embassy plot. He was in custody until his trial and conviction in 2005, then released on house arrest in 2009. After Beghal's release, French authorities collected more than 45,000 pages of wire transcripts and surveillance images of him, including when he was under house arrest. The images include a 2010 photo of Beghal with Cherif Kouachi and two other men, in a park. And a second photo, also taken in 2010, is of Beghal with Coulibaly, who visited the recruiter in Cantal, France, with Boumeddiene.  A Western intelligence source verified the authenticity of the images obtained by CNN. Beghal's time out of prison didn't last long. In 2010, he was arrested and charged with involvement in same prison-break plot that landed Coulibaly in prison. He was sentenced to 12 years in prison and remains behind bars. Beghal's ties to al Qaeda stretch back before the 9/11 attacks in the United States against the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the source said. In November 2000, Beghal traveled to Afghanistan for eight months, also visiting Pakistan. According to court records, he was put in charge of the plot to blow up the U.S. Embassy in Paris -- an attack eerily similar to the 1998 attacks against U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. The Western intelligence source says Beghal was given instructions to go to Dubai and then Morocco, where he would lose his old passport and get a new one.  He was then instructed to travel to Spain where he would be given the equivalent of $60,000 to carry out the Paris attack on the U.S. Embassy.  But Begahl was stopped and questioned as he passed through Dubai.  According to the Western intelligence source, he confessed during interrogation to the planned attack on the embassy.  He was ultimately convicted in a French court. U.S. authorities never brought charges against the French-Algerian as they did other al Qaeda operatives involved in 1998 attacks on U.S. Embassies in East Africa. Beghal's mentor was Finsbury Park mosque cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri, convicted just last week on terrorism charges and sentenced to life by a federal judge in New York. Abu Hamza is believed to have radicalized and influenced convicted terrorists shoe-bomber Richard Reid and 9/11's Zacarias Moussaoui. The source says Beghal later took the name Abu Hamza out of respect for his mentor. CNN's Tim Lister contributed to this report.","The man who was once al Qaeda's top European recruiter was a mentor to Coulibaly and Kouachi .

"You're in no danger of falling in, but a large group of possible cosmic vacuum cleaners have just been identified. Researchers have come upon 26 possible black holes in Andromeda, a galaxy near our own. This is the largest number of possible black holes found in a galaxy outside the Milky Way, but that may be because of Andromeda's relative proximity to our galaxy. It's probably easiest for Earth-based scientists to find black holes outside the Milky Way there, said Robin Barnard of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Combining this discovery with previous observations of nine other black hole candidates, scientists can say that Andromeda has a total of 35 possible black holes. The research is published in The Astrophysical Journal. NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory made more than 150 observations over the course of 13 years to identify these black hole candidates. Seven of the new potential Andromeda black holes reside within 1,000 light years of the center of that galaxy. This supports earlier research showing that, near the center of Andromeda, there are an unusual number of X-ray sources. Black holes can't be seen directly. But astronomers can detect material falling into them when they interfere with other stars. A black hole is a dense region of space that has collapsed in on itself in such a way that nothing can escape it, not even light. In a binary system of this nature, a black hole and a star orbit each other closely. Material from the star falls into the black hole and ""as it spirals in, it gets hotter and hotter, and faster and faster, and eventually it gives off X-rays, so we see lots and lots of X-rays coming out of it,"" Barnard said. The material as it has been swallowed gets incredibly hot, up to about 10 billion degrees. Because of the tremendous amount of energy released, some of the brightest objects in the universe are black holes. It's hard for scientists to distinguish distant black holes from neutron stars, however. When a star explodes in a supernova, its fiery death leaves behind either a neutron star or a black hole, which is a more extreme version of a neutron star. If our own sun were a neutron star, it would be only about 10 kilometers, or 6.2 miles, across, Barnard said. By comparison, as a black hole our sun might be only 2 kilometers across. Black holes of the kind that scientists may have spotted in Andromeda have masses that are typically five to 10 times that of the sun. Neutron stars have a surface, so falling material pounds onto it, Barnard said. Material rains down at enormous speeds, causing huge explosions and energy emissions. Billions of years from now, the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies will collide, marking the end of the galaxy as we know it.

"Fifty years ago this month, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral argument in a libel case, New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, that at the time few thought would go on to achieve landmark status. The Sullivan case, despite its roots in the early civil rights movement and the career of Martin Luther King Jr., is still little-known outside legal and media circles. But as it marks its 50th anniversary, Sullivan deserves to be revisited. No contemporary Supreme Court case has done more to define modern freedom of the press. These days, as the ongoing case of James Risen of The New York Times shows, reporters do have to worry that if they go too far in revealing embarrassing government secrets, they might find the government taking them to court to force them to reveal confidential sources. That is what has happened to Risen as a result of his investigation of a classified CIA program. What reporters don't have worry about, though, as they once did, is government officials charging them with libel as a way of silencing their criticism. Whether they acknowledge it or not,  investigative reporters over the past half century -- from Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein in ""All the President's Men"" to Seymour Hersh in ""Chain of Command: The Road from 9/11 to Abu Ghraib"" -- are indebted to the Supreme Court's Sullivan ruling for the freedom they have had to challenge the government's version of events. Sullivan had its origins in a fundraising ad, ""Heed Their Rising Voices,"" that the Committee to Defend Martin Luther King and the Struggle for Freedom in the South placed in The New York Times on March 29, 1960. Opinion: For women, equal pay and economic justice are civil rights issues . The committee -- which included A. Philip Randolph, president of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, and entertainers such as Harry Belafonte, Sidney Poitier and Nat King Cole -- had been set up to raise money for King, whom an Alabama grand jury had charged with tax evasion. ""Heed Their Rising Voices"" did not criticize any Southerner by name, but it did speak of attacks on the civil rights movement by ""Southern violators of the Constitution.""  The ad became vulnerable to a libel suit because on a series of very specific points, it contained factual errors. The ad said that King had been arrested by Alabama authorities seven times when he had been arrested only four times. The ad said that black students were expelled from Alabama State College for a racial protest they held on the State Capitol steps, where they sang ""My Country, 'Tis of Thee."" In fact, the students sang the national anthem on the State Capitol steps, and they were expelled by the State Board of Education for demanding service at a segregated lunch counter in the Montgomery County Court House. The misstatements of fact were all comparatively minor, but they made the Times vulnerable to legal action by Southern officials, who resented the prestigious paper for publishing ""Heed Their Rising Voices."" Under Alabama law, a resident could sue for libel when untruths that he believed defamatory were said about him. On April 19, L. B. Sullivan, a Montgomery city commissioner whose particular duties included supervising the city's police department, filed such a suit. Sullivan declared that misstatements about the police in Montgomery libeled him, even though they did not name him personally. He asked for damages of $500,000. Soon after Sullivan filed his suit, Alabama Gov. John Patterson filed a $500,000 suit of his own, also claiming libel.  Before long, the Times was facing $3 million in suits, a considerable sum in the 1960s. The implications of the suits were especially serious at a time when the civil rights movement was in its early stages.  If liberal, Northern papers could be silenced in their criticism of the South as a result of libel suits, the civil rights movement faced tough going.  When on April 12 and 13, Harrison Salisbury wrote Times stories critical of Birmingham, Alabama, his reports brought with it a new set of libel suits. In Alabama, which ever since Brown v. Board of Education had been doing its best to resist the desegregation of its schools, Sullivan's case was quickly decided. An all-white jury, acting on instructions from a judge who told the jurors that a statement was libelous unless a defendant could prove it was true in all respects, took just two hours and 20 minutes to award Sullivan the $500,000 for which he asked. The libel award was the largest in Alabama history, and on August 30, 1962, the Alabama Supreme Court unanimously upheld the lower's court's judgment against the Times. The Alabama Supreme Court's ruling was in keeping with tradition. U.S. law had long held that libel, as did pornography, did not qualify for First Amendment protection.  If the Times were to win its appeal, the Supreme Court would have to establish a new libel precedent. For a Supreme Court that 10 years earlier in Brown v. Board of Education had ruled that ""separate but equal"" had no place in America's public schools, overturning precedent was not out of the question, however. Earl Warren was still chief justice. And after Arthur Goldberg, John Kennedy's former secretary of labor, replaced Felix Frankfurter, a Franklin Roosevelt appointee, the Warren Court of 1964 was, if anything, more liberal than the Warren Court of 1954. Opinion: On MLK day, helping the unemployed is a moral issue . Warren assigned writing the opinion of the court in the Sullivan case to Justice William Brennan, like himself an Dwight Eisenhower appointee. By March 9, when the court announced its ruling, the justices were unanimous in their decision to reverse the Alabama State Supreme Court ruling. As soon as Brennan began reading from his opinion, it was clear that the Supreme Court had taken a fresh look at libel law. ""We are required in this case to determine for the first time the extent to which the constitutional protections of free speech and press limit a state's power to award damages in a libel action brought by a public official against critics of his official conduct,"" Brennan observed in his very first sentence. These were words that Sullivan and the South did not want to hear, and as Brennan continued reading from his opinion, it became clear that he and the Supreme Court were distinguishing between a libel action brought by a private person and a libel action brought by a government official.  To guarantee the First Amendment's effectiveness, a government official was not protected by the law in the same way that a private person was, Brennan declared. For Brennan, the historic basis for such a distinction went back to the notorious Sedition Act of 1798, which during the Federalist administration of John Adams made it a crime to utter or publish ""false, scandalous and malicious"" attacks against the government. Fines levied in Sedition Act prosecutions were later repaid by Congress on the grounds that the act was unconstitutional because of its violation of the First Amendment, and President Thomas Jefferson pardoned all who had been convicted and sentenced under the Sedition Act. The precedents contained in the repudiation of the Sedition Act applied to the present, Brennan insisted. For the First Amendment to remain meaningful, the only way a public official could be allowed to recover damages for a defamatory falsehood against him was if he could prove the falsehood was made with "" 'actual malice' -- that is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not."" Requiring a government critic to guarantee the truth of all his factual assertions on pain of a libel judgment risked imposing, as Brennan noted, ""self-censorship."" The result was a legal threshold that made it very difficult to charge the critic of a government official with libel. In a front page story, Times Supreme Court reporter Anthony Lewis, who would later write the definitive book on the Sullivan case, pointed out the Supreme Court had established a new ""constitutional landmark for freedom of the press and speech."" ""The case could have an immediate impact on press coverage of race relations in the South,"" Lewis went on to say. He was right. What he could not foresee was how in subsequent decades Sullivan would also lessen the threats writers faced when they investigated the Watergate scandal, reports by America's Vietnam commanders of the number of enemy killed and the claims of the George W. Bush administration that Saddam Hussein's Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction.","Nicolaus Mills: Landmark New York Times v. Sullivan case rooted in civil rights movement .

"Pottstown, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- Health and safety concerns about Japanese nuclear power plants after this month's earthquake and tsunami have Lindsey Schiller wondering what could happen across the street from her own house in her Philadelphia suburb. Schiller, who is a registered nurse, has lived for nearly a decade with her husband and two children in the shadow of the Limerick Generating Station nuclear energy facility in Pottstown, about  20 miles northwest of Philadelphia. Since long before the Japanese disaster, Schiller's unique neighborhood landmark has been the source of family jokes. ""We kid around when we get really big flowers ... we're under the power plant, and I kid around that I glow,"" laughed Schiller as she held her baby Adam in sight of the plant's giant twin cooling towers. In all seriousness, she said, all the Schillers are happy and healthy. ""We have nothing going on different"" from anyone else despite their nuclear neighbors. But Schiller did express concern when she learned that new scientific data show a slightly higher risk that the plant may be damaged during a powerful earthquake, according to a report by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. ""Should something occur, they would warn us,"" Schiller said. ""I kind of figure we're all in the same boat."" Radiation: What you need to know . The power plant has sent information to surrounding residents that shows how to prepare for a nuclear emergency, Schiller said, but she admitted her family has not prepared an at-home emergency kit. ""We would just sort of put them together if we had to evacuate,"" Schiller said. The risk of a quake-related nuclear accident, experts say, is comparatively low because the facility is rated to withstand levels of seismic movement that are rare for the region. Based on U.S. Geological Survey seismic data from 1989, the NRC report estimated the annual risk of quake-related damage to the nuclear core at the Limerick plant to be relatively remote -- once in about 50,000 years. But updated research increased the chances of quake damage slightly. According to the NRC report, 2008 seismic hazard estimates from the USGS indicate the annual risk of damage to the core at about once in 20,000 years. ""The chances of damage are extremely remote, but engineers compare two very remote risks to understand their relative meaning,"" said Gregory S. Hardy, a consulting engineer with the NRC and the International Atomic Energy Agency for the firm Simpson Gumpertz & Heger. ""Getting into your car and driving on a freeway poses a risk that everyone realizes could result in a fatal crash, but the chances are so remote that we decide to take that risk."" How close are you to a U.S. nuclear plant? Limerick operator Exelon released a statement recently expressing confidence that its ""nuclear facilities are equipped with numerous and redundant safety systems designed to protect them against earthquakes, flooding and other natural disasters."" Although Schiller's concerns about earthquakes have risen after the March 11 disaster, the troubles with Japan's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant aren't directly blamed on the quake, but on the devastating tsunami that followed it. After the 9.0-magnitude quake hit, the tsunami cut off power to systems that cooled nuclear fuel. Virtually landlocked Pennsylvania is not in a danger zone for tsunamis. Pennsylvania State University geoscience professor Dave Bice said a similar quake in this region is very unlikely. ""There's very, very little earthquake activity here,"" he said. ""In some areas, there are lots of very, very small earthquakes, but the energy they release is very, very minimal."" On Wednesday, the NRC announced it would review programs and regulations in light of the Japanese troubles to ensure protection of public health and safety. U.S. nuclear agency launches safety task force . As for Schiller, she doesn't anticipate an earthquake near her home anytime soon. But if something does happen, she said, ""We're going to be the first ones to find out."" For some, Limerick's towering structures provide a reliable directional beacon for Pottstown's 22,377 residents, as they make their way to the local outlet shopping mall with its Gap and Cole Haan stores and a new Wegmans grocery store not far away. But the towers also remind residents that nuclear power comes with risks that are very different from traditional fossil fuel-burning plants. In a national CNN/Research Corporation poll of Americans who live near nuclear power plants, nearly 60% said it's unlikely that a disaster or accident would put their families in immediate danger. In addition, nearly 60% of poll respondents said they didn't think local emergency services were prepared to handle that kind of situation. See details about the poll . The same poll also suggests that most Americans living near nuclear power plants haven't prepared disaster supply kits. Tour a New York nuclear power facility . Schiller said she's generally comfortable with her community's preparedness. ""All the local schools, they all have evacuation plans and they tell you where your child will be evacuated to."" But public reaction to an emergency is something that gives Schiller pause. ""I honestly would be afraid that there would be some mass panic -- mass exodus -- and the highways and the roads would get pretty congested and blocked, and I think it potentially could be chaotic."" Nukes protected from big disaster costs . The Limerick plant, which first went online in 1986, can keep electricity flowing to more than 2 million homes, its website says. It's awaiting NRC approval to increase its capacity, and the plant's owners intend to apply for a 20-year extension to its operating license. In a statement, John Rowe, Exelon chairman and CEO, said his company's ""plants are safe, particularly given the different seismic patterns in our regions and the absence of tsunami-type events where we have operations."" Congressional supporters of nuclear power, like Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Connecticut, have expressed interest in slowing down the permitting process for new nuclear power plants in the U.S. until more information is known about the troubles at the Japanese facilities. Nuke lobbyists scramble on Capitol Hill . Rowe's statement said, ""... we watch, we learn, and we will work with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and other policymakers, as well as industry colleagues, on what, if anything, should be done to apply what can be learned from"" events in Japan. Far from Capitol Hill, perhaps nowhere is the nuclear reminder taller and more in-your-face than at Schiller's home, which is dwarfed by Limerick's twin towers. When she looks out the living room window of her cozy home, they are just a couple of football fields away from her front door. Schiller says she's not planning any major changes in light of the NRC report and the events in Japan. ""Let's just say I'm not gonna pack up and leave tomorrow.""","Pennsylvania mom concerned about a nuclear power plant across the street .

"(CNN) -- A Little Rock, Arkansas, television anchorwoman who was attacked in her home and severely beaten died from her injuries Saturday. Anne Pressly, 26, was a popular morning news anchor at KATV in Little Rock, Arkansas. Anne Pressly, 26, the morning anchor on KATV, was found in her home Monday, savagely beaten mostly on her face and upper body. She had been hospitalized and sedated, unable to speak and suffering from massive brain swelling, her family said. Police said she might have been the victim of a burglary because her purse was missing. Her credit card was used at a gas station sometime this week, police said. Her father Guy Cannady appeared on ""Good Morning America"" earlier in the week and said he doubts the attack was random. ""It's so hard to understand, first of all, why would anybody vandalize and brutalize somebody to this extent,"" he said. ""There are items missing from the home. The severity of the injuries and brutality of the attack in my own mind calls into question the motive."" Pressly's left hand was broken, possibly as she tried to fight off her attacker. Her father earlier said that his daughter's brain had swollen and she was unable to communicate, making it impossible for her to talk to police. Public personalities, including those on television, are sometimes stalked. Police have yet to identify a suspect, although detectives have combed the area around Pressly's home in the Heights neighborhood, a mix of bungalows and mansions near the Little Rock Country Club. A $30,000 reward, established by KATV, will go to anyone who provides information leading to the arrest of Pressly's attacker, the station reported Saturday. The anchor's death comes just one day after reports that her condition appeared to be improving. Dr. Clifton R. Johnson said on Friday that the swelling in her brain had gone down and that doctors were slowly reducing her sedative dosages. Pressly's parents released a statement Saturday saying they were ""with her in her last moments,"" and that they needed privacy. On Saturday, KATV opened its nightly news cast with a seven-minute segment devoted to Pressly. Anchor Pamela Smith told viewers that Pressly's family agreed to have their daughter donate her organs. An emotional Smith read condolences sent into the station, her eyes red. ""She owned every room she was in, not because she demanded our attention, but because we willingly gave it to her,"" Smith said. ""We all felt a little better, a little more alive just being near her."" Cannady told ABC News that his family has received many letters of support during the week from across the world. Director Oliver Stone wrote one of them. Pressly made a brief appearance as a television commentator in Stone's new movie, ""W."" ""You're one hellava gal,"" he wrote. ""Keep fighting. You're a winner."" No funeral arrangements have been announced. ""Life was easy for Anne Pressly,"" Smith told viewers. ""But it is her death that is so very hard for all of us."" Copyright 2008 CNN.

"A Hamas official admitted Friday that militants from his group abducted three Israeli teens in the West Bank in June, but the official said the kidnappers did not tell their leaders about the action. The three teens were later found dead. Since then, violence has flared in the region. Saleh Aruri, a Hamas Political Bureau member, said in a statement from Doha, Qatar, the operation to abduct the teens was not approved by the Hamas leadership or its military wing, the Qassam Brigades. ""At that time, the Hamas leadership had no knowledge about this group or the operation it had just carried,"" Aruri said, referring to the abductors. ""It turned out later, however, that they were members of Hamas."" Tensions between Israel and Hamas ratcheted up June 30 after the bodies of the three were found in the West Bank. Friday's statement included no comment on the teens' deaths. Israel blamed the disappearances and deaths on Hamas. ""Hamas will pay,"" said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Meanwhile, the Hamas-run Al Aqsa TV reported Friday that the group had executed 18 suspected informants for Israel in Gaza on Friday, the Hamas-run Al Aqsa TV reported. The developments came one day after an Israeli strike in the Gaza city of Rafah killed three senior leaders of the Qassam Brigades. Palestinian militants fired more rockets into Israel on Friday, and the Israeli Defense Forces kept up airstrikes on Gaza. Ashraf el-Qedra, spokesman for the Ministry of Health in Gaza, said 2,092 Palestinians have been killed since the conflict began in early July. That figure did not include the reported executions. The United Nations estimates that around 70% of the dead in the conflict were civilians. The fighting has killed 68 people on the Israeli side, almost all of them soldiers. A 4-year-old boy became the latest civilian victim in Israel Friday, after a mortar shell exploded in the parking lot of a kibbutz close to Gaza, Israeli rescue services said. The boy is the first civilian casualty in Israel since the latest ceasefire collapsed, and the fourth in the recent fighting. El-Qedra said Friday that 76 Palestinians have been killed since the two sides resumed hostilities on Tuesday after the collapse of a ceasefire and talks aimed at finding a lasting end to the fighting. The truce fell apart after Israel reported that militants had started firing rockets again. Since the fighting flared up again this week, 360 rockets have been fired from Gaza toward Israel, according to the Israel Defense Forces. They have caused some injuries but no deaths. Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system has intercepted 56 of the rockets, the IDF said. The Israeli military has attacked around 200 targets in Gaza during the same period, the IDF said. Hamas, the militant group that holds power in Gaza, has warned that Israel will ""pay the price"" for killing three high-ranking leaders of its military wing, the Qassam Brigades, on Thursday. Seven civilians also were killed in the bombing of the house in southern Gaza where the leaders were located. The IDF said the military leaders were responsible for ""major terror attacks against Israelis."" The Qassam Brigades' threat this week to target Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv doesn't so far appear to have affected flights. Six decades of war . Gaza's zoo animals caught in crossfire .

"[Breaking news update 11:35 p.m.] . Diana Nyad has broken swimmer Penny Palfrey's 2012 distance record in the Cuba to Florida swim, putting her closer to Key West than anyone has ever swum without a shark cage. [Original story last posted at 10:18 p.m.] . Diana Nyad better than halfway through Cuba-to-Florida swim . Endurance swimmer Diana Nyad was better than halfway across the strait separating Cuba from the Florida Keys on Sunday on her fifth attempt to make it across the channel, her support team reported. After more than 30 hours in the water, the 64-year-old Nyad was more than 63 miles north of the marina where she began Saturday morning. ""This is farther than she has gone in any previous attempt,"" team navigator John Bartlett wrote on Nyad's website. ""Her path is only 5 miles to the east of a straight line from Marina Hemingway to Key West, thanks to a favorable Gulf Stream."" Nyad was still ""swimming strongly"" at just over 1.5 mph -- but averaging about 2 mph thanks to that favorable current, Bartlett wrote. Later, her handler said that Nyad was feeling strong and coherent. ""She is joking for the first time all day,"" wrote Bonnie Stoll on the same website. ""The only concern is that she is throwing up everything she eats. She's quite nauseous from sea salt, but that's to be expected,"" said Stoll. ""We're giving her enough calories and nutrition. We're just going to keep feeding her, and we hope that some of it is going down. She's not weak. Her stroke count hasn't changed."" Nyad is attempting to become the first person to swim the 103 miles without the benefits of a shark cage, flippers or wet suit. She's said it will be her last attempt at that mark, after previous attempts that were thwarted by dehydration, ocean currents and excruciating jellyfish stings to her tongue. This time, she's wearing a specially designed prosthetic face mask to prevent the jellyfish stings. ""It took us a year; we made mold after mold,"" Nyad said of the mask, adding it was the kind used to protect people who had suffered injuries to their faces. ""It's a two-edged sword for me. It's cumbersome, it's difficult to swim with, but it doesn't matter. I am safe. There's no other way."" She jumped into the water at 8:59 a.m. Saturday. Were Nyad to swim the 103 miles, it would validate her attempts, which have spanned 35 years. In 1997, Australian endurance swimmer Susie Maroney, then 22, completed the swim from within a shark cage. Along with the protection the cage offers against toothy predators, swimmers say the cage provides a barrier against waves and other weather hazards. Since Maroney's swim, some of the world's best endurance swimmers have tried to cross the straits of Florida without using a cage. All have been turned back, though Australia's Penny Palfrey made it 80 miles in 2012 before unfavorable currents forced her to quit. But few have done so as persistently or as colorfully as Nyad. The Los Angeles resident says she feels a special bond with Cubans and hopes her repeated efforts to swim between the two countries will help improve the still-tense relations between Havana and Washington. Nyad is being accompanied by a 35-member crew aboard two sail boats. They monitor her health, update her progress on social media and try to ward off sharks that might view her as a potential snack. If all goes as planned, Nyad said, the swim will take her three days to finish.","Diana Nyad is ""feeling strong ... joking for the first time all day,"" says her handler .

"For all the talk of a possible cease-fire, residents of Israel and Palestinians in Gaza are living under a daily barrage of attacks. More than 1,200 Palestinians have been killed, as have 53 Israeli soldiers and three civilians in Israel. Israel said it has wiped out the majority of Hamas' rocket supply, but the fighting shows no sign of abating. ""If the enemy has not had enough of our strikes, our fighters have a lot to surprise the enemy's leaders and its special forces,"" Hamas said Tuesday in an online posting. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his country Monday to prepare for ""a protracted campaign."" ""Our goal is clear,"" Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev told CNN on Tuesday.  ""Our goal is to free the people of Israel from the terror of these rocket attacks coming from Gaza and from these tunnel attacks coming from Gaza where people pop out of the ground with machine guns and explosives to kill and to murder, to kidnap people."" The goal ""can be achieved diplomatically or militarily or a combination of them both,"" he added.  ""But we will continue until that goal is achieved."" Just what it would take to stop Hamas militarily -- and whether that's even possible -- remains unclear.  Some key numbers: . 32 -- The number of tunnels Israel uncovered in Gaza as of Monday. Israel does not know how many more it may find. ""There are still chances that there are tunnels that we have no knowledge about that are already inside Israel,"" Israel Defense Forces spokesman Peter Lerner told CNN Tuesday. ""We're operating in order to locate them."" Each tunnel costs $3 million, according to the Israeli military. And for all the destruction wrought on Gaza, militants could still build more in the future. Hamas is the controlling government in Gaza. CNN's Wolf Blitzer goes into a Hamas tunnel . 10,000 - The number of rockets Israel estimated Hamas to have in its arsenal when the hostilities began. Militants have launched more than 2,600, according to the Israel Defense Forces. And the IDF has struck more than 3,000, IDF spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner told CNN on Tuesday. ""So our assessment is they're depleted around 60% of their capabilities,"" Lerner said. But given that Israel has found more tunnels than it expected, it's possible militants have more rockets than Israel realized, as well. And while many are smuggled in from Iran and Syria, many others are homemade, notes Michael Eisenstadt of the Washington Institute for near East Policy. ""You can always find, from the rubble, pipes that can be cut. And you can always scrounge ingredients to make propellant,"" he says. These rockets might be less effective, but militants will always ""be able to reconstitute their rocket force in some way,"" he says. ""So you never get to the point where you slap your hands and say, 'Mission accomplished.'"" Bombing workshops where many rockets are made might prevent militants from producing longer-range rockets that threaten people beyond southern Israel. But ""you'll never be able to bomb them to the point that they can't produce"" the cruder rockets, Eisenstadt said. In its online posting Tuesday, Hamas said it ""still retains its full power and force."" More than 300 -- The number of militants Israel says it has killed so far in the conflict.  The U.S. State Department says there are ""several thousand"" Gaza-based Hamas militant operatives along with a ""reported 9,000-person Hamas-led paramilitary group known as the 'Executive Force.'"" Israel, meanwhile, has 176,000 active military personnel, has called up some reservists and can tap into a pool of hundreds of thousands more if needed. Hamas leaders appear ""confident that the group could sustain its attacks until it secures its key demand: ending the blockade of the Gaza Strip by Egypt and Israel,"" says Jeremy Binnie, Middle East editor of IHS Jane's Defence Weekly. $62,000 -- The cost of each missile used by Israel's Iron Dome defense system to block militants' rockets from hitting Israelis. More than 500 have been used, making the total more than $31 million. ""We're confident we can continue to operate with that,"" Lerner told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. Each battery used by the Iron Dome system costs $50 million, IHS Jane's said. ""Despite the improvements in Iron Dome's performance in recent months, it's clear Israel is on the wrong side of the cost curve,"" says Christoper Chivvis, senior political scientist at Rand Corporation. ""The reality is that building sophisticated missile defense systems like Iron Dome remains much more expensive than acquiring missiles themselves."" How Iron Dome blocks rockets from Gaza, protects Israelis . 1.8 million and 8 million - Ultimately, the most important figures may be the populations of Gaza and Israel, respectively, and how they respond to the devastating casualties and destruction. The majority of Israelis currently support military action against Hamas, the Jerusalem Post reported. It's unclear how many in Gaza want militants to stop rocket attacks. Last month, a poll by the Washington Institute found most Palestinians in Gaza oppose a two-state solution and want to work toward a five-year goal of abolishing Israel -- but the majority said they support nonviolent methods of ""popular resistance.""","Hamas vows it has ""a lot to surprise the enemy""

"It's 3:15 a.m. Under the bright lights of the waterfront Haedomari warehouse in Shimonoseki, Japan, tails twitch and bodies writhe in defiance of the onset of death. The floor is awash with seawater as Yoshi Yanagawa moves down a line of 20 boxes, each containing about 15 puffer fish of varying values, lengths and states of coveted plumpness. ""Eeka! Eeka!"" he chants, as 20 or so interested parties put their hands up to bid. The puffer fish, or ""fugu"" in Japanese, gulp in more air, ballooning out their white belly sacs. Shimonoseki is Japan's fugu capital. Its Haedomari market is said to be the only one in the country that specializes in the infamous Japanese delicacy, famed both for its high price tag and lethal insides. Throughout the fishing season from early September to April 29, the market is open six mornings a week in the ancient port, 1,126 kilometers west of Tokyo in Honshu's most southwesterly part of Yamaguchi prefecture. For 15 years, 55-year-old Yanagawa has been the chief auctioneer (""seri"" or ""sekagi"") here. ""My job is unusual,"" says Yanagawa. ""Grown men squeeze my hand and fingers. They touch me every morning!  It's the traditional way of fugu bidding. ""I hold my slipover sleeve or 'fukuro zeri' out to them and they put their hands inside and tell me how much they want to pay. It's all done by finger pressure."" Ancient Egyptian bowling fish? When the auction is over, the sold fugu is packed into polystyrene boxes and taken away to the city's 10 processing factories. All are specially licensed to prepare and detoxify the fish in accordance with Japanese law. It's an important step, given fugu is hundreds of times more poisonous than cyanide, containing enough toxin in its liver alone to kill five men. Western Australia's Department of Fisheries says puffer fish are the second most poisonous vertebrate in the world after the golden poison frog. The ovaries, roe and kidneys are just as deadly as the liver -- all of which are incinerated after processing. One milligram of the fugu's tetrodotoxin is enough to bring on an agonizing death within an hour of being consumed. Yet ""takifugu rubripes"" (the official species name) is still the epitome of gourmet dining in Japan. Tokyo restaurant-goers are prepared to pay 22,000 yen ($210) for a near-death experience at high-end restaurants like three Michelin-starred Usukifugu Yamadaya, or the more moderately priced Torafugu Tei. In recent years, fish breeders have reportedly developed a non-toxic variety by restricting the fugu's diet, though the poison-filled version is as popular as ever. The threat of death is perhaps part of its allure. ""Paintings of fugu have been found in the tombs of ancient Egypt,"" says Toshiharu Hata, who runs one of the largest fugu wholesale businesses in Shimonoseki. ""The Egyptians used the fish to play a primitive version of bowling."" Hata's fugu history lesson doesn't end there. ""Captain Cook bought a fugu from the natives of New Caledonia and it killed a pig on board 'The Resolution,'"" he adds. ""The most famous human fatality happened in 1975 when Mitsugoro Bando VIII, a Kabuki actor, died after eating four portions!"" ""Every dish is a work of science"" Hata, whose father founded his family's fish company 40 years ago, explains that fugu is traditionally served in transparent paper-thin strips on painted porcelain plates. ""Master chefs cut them into the shapes of chrysanthemum petals, Mount Fuji or into animals like peacocks, turtles and butterflies,"" he says. ""Every plate is a work of art. Every dish is a work of science."" We walk around the factory floor, watching his staff wash and process the precious fish. ""The best is tiger fugu,"" says Hata. ""It sells at 40,000 yen a kilogram; one kilogram will feed 30 people. We ship them to New York. It wasn't until 1988 that we were allowed to export to the United States. ""But Shimonoseki is the best place to eat it as you get more when you order in a restaurant. Maybe 20 pieces compared to eight in Osaka and Tokyo. Tokuyama City is good too."" We stop in front of a man wearing a white coat and a hairnet, expertly filleting a fish with his ""hochi"" knife. He bows. ""He's in charge of our fish testicle and genitalia department,"" says Hata, reverently. A day in Shimonoseki . It's 6:30 a.m. as we drive into Shimonoseki's city center to hit up the Karato-Ichiba fish market (5-50 Karato-machi). Stalls are already set up, selling crabs, squid, sea urchins, clams and numerous types of multi-colored seaweed. Hata leads us to a little curtained-off booth in a corner of the market, one of many eating options here. ""The Tanabe Shokudu restaurant here is the best in town,"" he says, kissing his fingers and ordering two hot sakes. On the breakfast menu: raw slices of fresh tuna sashimi and fugu served with black ponzu sauce, followed by deep-fried tempura fugu, and a fugu ""chirinabe"" casserole with the local ""uiro"" rice cakes. There's also a fugu broth with sliced scallions, tofu and grated daikon radishes. All delicious, though slightly unnerving. Deadly dining aside, there's more to Shimonoseki and its surrounds than seafood markets. A 13-kilometer ride away from the city center lies the Chofu castle town of Jokamachi, home to Samurai Street, with its yellow walled houses and 14th-century lean-tos. Amid the shrine grounds, Hata explains the tenets of Japan's Bushido warrior class. ""The Meiji Revolution of 1867 began here,"" says Hata. ""This is the heart of the anti-shogunate movement. Here, Takasugi Shinsaku raised his army. ""Shimonoseki is the birthplace of modern Japan. Our country opened up to the West from here after a foreign flotilla bombarded the town and the disillusioned samurai persuaded the shogunate to accept foreigners."" Other attractions in and around the city worth checking out include: The Shimonoseki Marine Science Museum; Kozanji Temple, a designated National Treasure of Japan; Akama Shrine; the 1,780-meter-long Tsunoshima Bridge, which connects the island of Tsunoshima (part of Shimonoseki city) with Honshu; and Ganryujima, a tiny island famed for being the site of an epic duel between sword legends Miyamoto Musashi and Sasaki Kojirō.

"Bryan Ganey slowly climbed out of his parents' car. Michael and Martha Ganey had driven their son to work because he wasn't feeling well --  for the past couple of days, simple tasks had left him short of breath and exhausted. At 577 pounds, being out of shape was normal for Bryan, so he ignored it. But as he headed toward the door of his office on June 20, 2010, the ground suddenly shifted. The Ganeys were pulling away when Martha's cell phone rang. All she heard on the other end was gasping. The couple stopped the car and sprinted back to the building, where they found their son lying in the bushes, struggling to breathe.  The ride to the hospital took only five minutes, but to Martha, it seemed like hours. Bryan didn't care how long it took -- he knew he was going to die. ""I was absolutely convinced that I was having a heart attack. I had been told by doctors before that at my size, if I ever had heart problems, they weren't going to be able to operate on me. So there was a very good chance that this was the end -- that I would get there and there wouldn't be anything they could do,"" he said. Out of control . For years, Bryan worked the night shift at a Verizon call center in Charleston, South Carolina, 20 miles from his home in Moncks Corner. He skipped breakfast, ate fast food for lunch and dinner, then picked up a pizza or some convenience store snacks on his way home. He often drank more than a gallon of soda a day. By the age of 37, he had a body mass index around 87. A BMI over 30 is considered obese. ""He was very aware that he had a problem,"" Martha said. ""It was out of control."" June 20 was possibly the best thing that could have happened to Bryan, although it certainly didn't seem like it at the time. His ""heart attack"" was actually a pulmonary embolism, or a blood clot that had traveled to his lungs, blocking his oxygen flow. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ""sudden death is the first symptom"" in about a quarter of patients who have a pulmonary embolism. For six days, Bryan lay in a hospital bed, covered in bruises caused by the blood thinners being pumped into his body. The blood thinners slowly cleared the blockage in his lungs, giving him plenty of time to think. ""At first, I felt like a victim, like somebody or something had done this to me,"" Bryan said in a YouTube video about his experience. ""But then reality set in and the pain turned to anger. My condition was unacceptable."" Several doctors tried to broach the subject of weight-loss surgery while he was in the hospital, but Bryan refused. Both he and his mother had friends who had gone through the surgery and were suffering from complications. If I can make it out of here alive, he thought, I'm not coming back. Small steps . Today, Bryan, 39, tells his story from the driver's seat of a car that he wouldn't have fit in two years ago .  He shops for clothes at department stores, buys one seat on an airplane instead of two and sleeps through the night. ""The absolute best thing about all the weight that I've lost is just waking up every day and realizing that I don't weigh 577 pounds anymore,"" he said with a laugh. ""The biggest rewards are the smallest ones."" Small steps are what began Bryan's weight loss journey. After leaving the hospital, he began to move -- at first pushing a shopping cart around the grocery store like a toddler learning to walk. Then he ventured to the mailbox at the end of his driveway. Soon, he was conquering several miles at a time. He lost 130 pounds in the first six months, then dropped another 140 pounds over the course of the next year. At 5-foot-8, Bryan now weighs just under 300 pounds. ""It turns out it really is true,"" Bryan wrote in his iReport submission. ""If you use more energy than you take in, you will lose weight."" Bryan switched to a day shift at work to conquer his bad eating habits. He's very particular about what he puts in his mouth, refusing to stray from self-prepared lean meats, vegetables and fruits. He eats five to six meals a day, every two to three hours. He measures his portions so that his total calorie count for the day hits 2,500. ""Food is everywhere,"" he said, reflecting on his struggles to keep on track at work or in social settings. ""I just can't eat it anymore. I can't do it ever again. I don't have the ability to have just a little bit. They think I must be miserable because I ... don't allow myself to have certain things. [But] the benefits I have gained, the prize is worth the struggle."" After dropping his first 70 pounds, Bryan decided to hire a personal trainer. This wasn't the first time he had tried to lose weight by exercising, and in the past he had burned himself out pushing too hard, too fast. His trainer, Martha Peake, started slowly. At first, all they did was sit down and stand up. For the 500-pound Bryan, that was enough. Last year, Bryan limped across the finish line of the 10K race he entered. This year, he plans to run the whole race. He's still losing six to seven pounds a month and hopes to eventually get down to 200 pounds. Simple prayers . Every morning, Martha wakes up and asks God to give Bryan one more day. She understands the obstacles placed before her son -- most addicts can give up their abusive substance, but he can't just give up food. ""I guess there's always that little shadow of a doubt,"" Martha said. ""But I know also that he's a very strong person ... if it can be done, he can do it."" When Bryan returned to the doctor, the change in his blood work was almost unbelievable. He's off many of the medications he was on before; his blood pressure medication has been cut four times over the last two years. His LDL cholesterol, the bad kind, is 100 -- an optimal number. Most importantly, at 577 pounds, Bryan was prediabetic. Now, he's looking forward to a bright, diabetes-free future. ""I think what gets lost in the advertisements and everything that's written about weight loss is that if people would keep it simple, that everyone has that power in them. You can change your life."" Do you have a weight-loss story to share? Visit iReport.com.","Bryan Ganey suddenly couldn't breathe and collapsed in a parking lot .

"The undersea mapping of the main search area for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has found small parts of the ocean floor that are harder than the surrounding rock, but the objects detected are unlikely to be man-made, Australian authorities said Friday. Ships have been surveying tens of thousands of square kilometers of the bottom of the southern Indian Ocean as search officials prepare for the next phase of the hunt for the passenger jet, which disappeared nearly six months ago with 239 people on board. The mapping is necessary because the area of ocean, far off the Western Australian coast, is so remote that its depth and seafloor terrain were largely unknown before the search for the plane drew attention to it. The maps will help the search crews as they deploy underwater vehicles and scanning devices to look for wreckage from Flight 370. The search efforts in the 60,000-square-kilometer priority zone are expected to begin this month and last up to a year. Australian geoscientists have been analyzing the data gathered during the mapping survey, in part to gauge the hardness of the ocean floor -- whether it's hard rock, soft rock or silt. ""We have detected a number of areas where there are small areas that are relatively harder than the surrounding rock. There's multiple detections of this sort,"" said Martin Dolan, chief commissioner of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, which is overseeing the underwater search. ""It's unlikely to be a man-made object, much more likely to be a geological formation,"" Dolan told CNN. ""Nevertheless, we will feed all this information into our overall planning of our search of the priority areas for the location of MH370."" Dolan first referred to the hard areas of the ocean floor in comments reported by The Times of London. The areas are inside the priority search zone, he told CNN, but he wasn't able to say how big they were. Adjustments to search area . Dolan also said Friday that search officials are likely to make adjustments to the main search zone once their team of international experts has finished refining its analysis of satellite data related to the missing plane. ""We may end up with some areas that extend beyond the priority orange zone,"" he said, referring to the area where officials have said MH370 is most likely to have gone down. Australian Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss said last week that areas in the southern part of the search zone may be of particular interest. The revised analysis is based on an improved understanding of how a ground station in Australia was handling the satellite signal's frequency, Dolan said Friday. ""We remain fully committed to finding the missing aircraft, and although it's taken us a long time to get there, we're at a point where we've completed almost all the planning work and can move to the operation phase of the underwater search,"" he said. The search is scheduled to start late this month, and all the assets involved will be operational in early October. Flight 370 dropped off radar on March 8, en route from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing. No debris of the Boeing 777 has been found, and officials don't know why it flew off course. After it lost radar contact, the plane continued to communicate periodically with a satellite system, providing experts with data they say shows it flew south into the Indian Ocean.","Mapping of the search zone has detected particularly hard areas of seafloor .

"The intricate design etched into a field of barley two hours south of San Francisco was spotted Monday morning by Julie Belanger, a photographer, as she and her husband were flying over. ""What is it?"" was her first thought, she told CNN affiliate KSBW. Whatever it was, ""It was beautiful, quite beautiful,"" she said, adding that they came upon it by chance but that she was skeptical that the crop circle was evidence of something otherworldly. ""I believe it's possible that aliens exist, but I don't know if they would bother making a crop circle to give us a message,"" she said. Still, the news spread quickly. The field's owner, Scott Anthony, had just returned from vacation to his home when he got a call from one of the employees on his 2,000-acre farm outside the tiny town of Chualar, 10 miles southeast of Salinas. ""He said, 'Hey, there's a buncha stuff out in the middle of the field,' so when I went up there I go, 'Ohhhh, shoot!',"" the 58-year-old farmer told CNN Tuesday in a telephone interview. What he saw was an elaborate design sculpted into one to two acres of his barley field: a crop circle -- more precisely, a lot of squares and rectangles within a large circle. ""To me, it looks like a computer chip, or something like that,"" said Anthony, who added that he had no idea what may have caused it. ""To be that intricate in design, it kind of baffles me as to how that was done,"" he said about the flattened grassland. ""It didn't look burned to me, it just looked like it was pushed over."" Soon, the news vans showed up, followed by the curious, some of whom stood on fences to get a better view. Anthony called security agents to keep people from crossing onto his farmland, where he also grows broccoli, snap peas and lettuce. ""It's a food-safety issue,"" he said. That hasn't stopped the roadsides from filling with the curious, many of them self-appointed experts. ""It looks like aliens to me,"" Manuel Madrid of nearby Gonzales told KSBW. ""Definitely pranksters,"" said Brandon Brooks of Chualar, who added, ""This is kind of a strange place to have anything out of the ordinary happen."" The latter theory got some support from Jim Gillott, who told KSBW that he had seen 20 to 30 people with ladders in the field in the days before the design was discovered. And Jake Gain said he too had seen evidence that humans were involved. ""Every time I drove by, I saw them either parked over there,"" he said, pointing, ""or people in the field just walking around, and it looked like they had little GPSes or something,"" he said. And someone identified solely as ""Cannot Say"" posted a 2½-minute video on YouTube that shows green flashes of light emanating from what appears to be the field before dawn on Monday. ""Dude, this is a crop circle,"" says one of two men in the video as they clamber from their car into the field. The founding publisher of Skeptic magazine was unimpressed. ""It looks like a couple of kids did this,"" Michael Shermer told CNN. ""Short of having a video of it, it's hard to prove that kids did it. So, in that case, we have to make a choice: what's more likely? That aliens landed in Chualar, California, or that a couple of pranksters made it? ""We have zero evidence of aliens landing anywhere; we have lots of evidence of pranksters hoaxing."" Such circles can be made by simply dragging a rope attached to a board over the grass, he said. Still, he noted, such stories are attractive to many. ""People seem less intrigued by pranksters than they do by aliens, so it's a compelling story for people to think that we're not alone."" Farmer Anthony said he was out of town during the week before the discovery, so he saw nothing that might have tipped him off that pranksters were at work. But whoever -- or whatever -- caused the circle has caused him no lasting upheaval -- financial or otherwise. The barley was planted between cash crops to add nutrients to the fields; he is planning to plow it -- and the crop circle -- back into the earth on Thursday.","""It was beautiful,"" says photographer Julie Belanger, who spotted crop circle .

"Russia ordered surprise military exercises on Ukraine's doorstep Wednesday as tensions in that country's southern Crimea region simmered, with pro-Russian demonstrators facing off against rival protesters in the city of Simferopol. As the mood soured among the thousands rallying in front of the Crimean parliament building in Simferopol, some scuffles broke out. One group waved Ukrainian flags and shouted ""Crimea is not Russia,"" while the other held Russian flags aloft and shouted ""Crimea is Russia,"" images broadcast by Crimean TV channel ATR showed. As the crowd became more agitated, a line of police moved in to divide the groups. Local leaders sought to calm the mood, urging the protesters to go home and resist provocations. One man died around the time of the protests in front of Parliament, the Crimean Ministry of Health said on its website. The man had no visible signs of injury, and early indications point to a heart attack, it said. Seven people sought medical help. The demonstrations signal the broad divide between those who support what is going on in Kiev, where the new government is leaning toward the West, and those who back Russia's continued influence in Crimea and across Ukraine. In the capital Wednesday, the names of nominees for the country's new unity government were read to the crowd in Independence Square. Opposition leader Arseniy Yatsenyuk was named as a nominee for interim prime minister, while activist Dmytro Bulatov was put forward as sports minister. Candidates are expected to be voted on in Parliament Thursday. Russia's foreign minister has vowed not to intervene militarily in Ukraine. But with tensions in the region high, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered surprise military exercises. The exercises are ""to check combat readiness of armed forces in western and central military districts as well as several branches of the armed forces,"" Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu was quoted as saying by state media. Shoigu did not mention Ukraine, which lies to Russia's west, but the timing of the move has prompted speculation about the motivation. Ukraine's Ministry of Defense declined to comment on the exercises since they are on Russian territory. U.S. military intelligence has seen some Russian naval ship movement near Ukraine since the weekend, but it sees no immediate indication the Russians are preparing for any offensive military action in Ukraine, two U.S. officials said. Instead, the officials said intelligence suggests Russia is ""repositioning"" up to half a dozen Russian ships near the Ukrainian port city of Sevastapol in case they're needed to respond if Russian interests are threatened. ""They want to have their assets more accessible if needed,"" one official said. ""This will allow for an expedited response."" Sevastapol is home to Russia's Black Sea fleet, so the ships could be used, if needed, to protect the base, Russian military assets and personnel, and Russian citizens around Sevastapol, the U.S. officials said. About 60% of the population in the city is Russian. The White House urged ""outside actors"" to respect Ukraine's sovereignty. ""We urge outside actors in the region to respect Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity and end provocative rhetoric and (take) actions to support democratically established transitional government structures and use their influence in support of unity, peace and an inclusive path forward,"" Deputy Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters. Russia held at least six snap combat readiness checks of its armed forces last year, the state-run RIA Novosti news agency said. 'Rumors' fuel fears of split . Concerns were heightened in the Crimea region when the Crimean Parliament convened a previously unscheduled session Wednesday, amid local media reports that secession might be on the agenda. But the Parliament speaker, Volodimir Konstantinov, denied there were plans to discuss ""radical issues"" such as the separation of Russia-oriented Crimea from Ukraine. In a statement on the Parliament website, he dismissed the local media reports as ""rumors,"" saying they were ""a provocation aimed at discrediting and de-legitimizing the Crimean parliament."" He also urged the Crimean people to remain calm and not be provoked, the statement said. In Sevastopol, residents told CNN they were angry that President Viktor Yanukovych has been forced out and fear that they will be oppressed by the country's new leaders. Small pro-Russian protests were taking place in the Black Sea city Wednesday. A CNN team in the area encountered more than one pro-Russian militia checkpoint on the road from Sevastopol to Simferopol. Yanukovych's base of support is in eastern and southern Ukraine, where Russian culture and language predominate. In that region, most people are suspicious of the Europe-leaning views of their counterparts in western Ukraine, who were at the heart of the anti-government protests that filled central Kiev. Many are struggling to come to grips with the rapid political upheaval that has unfolded in Ukraine in recent days, after months of protests and last week's bloody clashes between protesters and security forces. Russia's Foreign Ministry has accused Ukraine's lawmakers of discriminating against ethnic Russians by excluding them from the reform process. Talks on new government . The tensions come as Ukraine's lawmakers scramble to put together a new unity government amid continued instability after Yanukovych's ouster. Vasil Gatsko, of the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reforms (UDAR) party, said the newly formed government will be officially voted on in Ukraine's Parliament on Thursday morning. The interim authorities had initially hoped to announce a new government Tuesday. The names of the nominees for the new administration were read in Kiev's Independence Square, or Maidan -- which has been at the heart of the protest movement -- for approval from the crowds gathered there.  The nominees were selected in a meeting Wednesday of the three main opposition parties and smaller parties. Bulatov, who was put forward as sports minister, spoke to CNN soon after the announcement. He is well-known as the activist who reappeared more than a week after he went missing amid anti-government protests, telling reporters he'd been kidnapped and tortured by his captors. ""People have to feel the changes, not to hear about them, but see them,"" he said. When asked what he saw as his biggest challenge as a possible minister, Bulatov replied: transparency. ""I think the first thing I must do is to bring more transparency,"" he said. ""It's gonna be the society, civil society I mean, who will be making decisions. The minister is a public person, and people must decide what is better, what are the priorities."" Lawmakers face the challenge of forming a body that genuinely represents of all the main political parties, despite their widely divergent views, and includes technical experts and some of the people's heroes from the protests in Independence Square. Presidential and local elections are due to be held on May 25. One candidate has already been announced. Opposition leader and former heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko, of the UDAR party, will run for the presidency, his press secretary Oksana Zinovyeva said. 'We were trapped': Eyewitness to the massacre in Kiev . Elite riot police disbanded . Earlier Wednesday, acting Interior Minister Arsen Avakov announced that a riot police force used against anti-government protesters in Ukraine had been disbanded. Demonstrators accused the elite Berkut force, deployed by the government of Yanukovych to quell recent protests, of using excessive force. Avakov said on his Facebook page that he'd signed the order disbanding the force Tuesday. But the new, pro-Russian mayor of Sevastopol said Tuesday night at a rally in the city that he had secured funding to keep paying Berkut riot police there even after the force was disbanded. The mayor, Alexej Chaliy, was elected in an unofficial local vote, but the interim authorities in Kiev have said he is not a legitimate leader. Last week, the bloody street clashes between demonstrators and security forces left more than 80 dead, the deadliest violence in the country since it gained independence when the Soviet Union collapsed 22 years ago. Russia, which backed Yanukovych, contends that the President was driven out by an ""armed mutiny"" of extremists and terrorists. A warrant has been issued for his arrest, but his whereabouts remain unknown. Diplomatic moves . While Yanukovych is on the run, the diplomatic wheels have been set in motion within the international community. One key concern is Ukraine's perilous financial position. Interim Finance Minister Yury Kolobov proposed Monday that an international donor conference be held within two weeks. Ukraine, he said, will need $35 billion in foreign assistance by the end of 2015. Russia had offered Ukraine a $15 billion loan and cut in natural gas prices in November, but that deal seems unlikely to remain on the table if Ukraine turns toward Europe. UK Foreign Secretary William Hague tweeted Wednesday: ""Will discuss international financial support for #Ukraine at the IMF in Washington DC today."" Ukrainian state news agency Ukrinform said the country has slashed its imports of natural gas from Russia in recent days. A U.S. State Department spokeswoman on Wednesday stressed that no decision has been made about financial assistance. ""The United States is continuing to consider a range of options, including loan guarantees, to support Ukraine economically.  But no decision has been made, and the next step is the formation of a multiparty, technical government. ""Once that government is formed, we will begin to take immediate steps, in coordination with multilateral and bilateral partners, that could compliment an IMF package, to support Ukraine,"" said spokeswoman Jen Psaki. Speaking in Washington on Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said officials were ""deeply engaged in trying to help this extraordinary transition that is taking place in Ukraine."" In a joint news conference with Hague, Kerry said that Ukraine's alliances should not necessarily determine what happens to its people -- and that it was not a ""zero sum"" game. ""It is not a Russia or the United States or other choices,"" he said. ""This is about people of Ukraine and Ukrainians making their choice about their future. And we want to work with Russia, with other countries, with everybody available to make sure this is peaceful from this day forward."" Yanukovych's decision to scrap a European Union trade deal in favor of one with Russia prompted the protests, which began in November. Opinion: What the West owes Ukraine .

"Texas Gov. Rick Perry and others are lashing out at President Barack Obama's decision not to tour border facilities overwhelmed by a flood of undocumented children, saying the U.S. leader needs to see with his own eyes what both sides agree is a humanitarian crisis. ""The American people expect to see their President when there is a disaster,"" Perry told CNN's Kate Bolduan in an interview that aired Thursday, citing Obama's trip to the East Coast to tour damage caused by Superstorm Sandy in 2012. ""He showed up at Sandy. Why not Texas?"" Both Republicans and the White House have described the crush of Central American children as a humanitarian crisis, but Obama said Wednesday that visiting facilities where the children are processed and detained would be little more than a photo opportunity. ""There's nothing that is taking place down there that I am not intimately aware of and briefed on. This isn't theater. This is a problem,"" Obama said Wednesday. The controversy has been compared to President George W. Bush's initial decision not to tour the storm-ravaged Gulf Coast after 2005's Hurricane Katrina. Bush opted instead to fly over the coast in Air Force One, resulting in a famous picture of the President peering down at the devastation from his jet. It left many feeling that Bush was detached and uncaring. Bush later acknowledged that failing to land and at least express solidarity with victims was a mistake. Perry alluded to that Wednesday in an interview on the Fox News program ""Hannity."" ""I'm pretty sure that if George Bush had said, 'well I sent my FEMA director multiple times,' he still would have been criticized greatly,"" he told ""Hannity,"" according to a report on the network's website. ""Because you need to go. That's what governors do, that's what presidents do,"" Perry said. ""When there are natural disasters, when there are crises like these, a president needs to be there to show the American people, No. 1, that he understands."" 'Go down there and see what we're facing' Even some Democrats were critical of the decision. U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, said on CNN's ""New Day"" that it's important for Obama to see what the children are going through. ""I'm interested in him looking at the kids. The kids that I've talked to, little innocent little boys and girls that have come across and have traveled over 1,000 miles, that one-third of the girls have been abused and raped on the way up here,"" he said. ""The last young kid was an 11-year-old little boy from Guatemala that died of dehydration. That is the face that I want him to see. Don't take any cameras, Mr. President, but go down there and see what we're facing."" Obama has called on Congress to quickly approve his request for $3.7 billion in emergency funding to deal with the crisis, which has seen thousands of undocumented children crossing the border without their parents. Many have surrendered themselves to U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers on the belief they will be allowed to stay in the country, and officials have struggled to house the children amid a staggering backlog of immigration cases. Obama said Wednesday that ""the problem here is not a major disagreement around the actions that could be helpful in dealing with the problem."" The challenge he said, is whether Congress is prepared to ""put the resources in place to get this done."" ""Are folks more interested in politics, or are they more interested in solving the problem?"" he said. Is the immigration crisis Rick Perry's second act? Process overwhelmed . The surge of undocumented youths from Central America has overwhelmed federal facilities and revived the debate over an immigration policy overhaul, one of the most partisan issues in the already overheated political climate of an election year. U.S. authorities estimate that 60,000 to 80,000 undocumented children will cross the border without their parents this year. While many have been released to family pending deportation hearings, others have been detained by authorities amid a growing backlog of pending cases. Obama administration officials blame the influx on dire conditions in countries such as Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. Critics, however, say the administration invited the problem by halting deportations of some young immigrants who arrived illegally in past years. ""The children are a symptom of policies that have enticed them to come,"" Perry said. ""The first thing you have to do is stop the flow, because if we don't, then the problem's not going to be the size we have today."" Republicans have called for the repeal of a 2008 law signed by President George W. Bush that requires deportation hearings before sending back children from countries that do not border the United States. ""I don't think we can solve the problem unless we revisit"" the law, Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn said. ""What's happened is these children are placed with family members in the United States and given a notice to appear for a later court hearing. Some have called this a notice to disappear, not a notice to appear,"" as most don't show up, he said. Another Republican, Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, said the United States should immediately fly the children back to their home countries. It would cost less and signal U.S. intolerance for those who enter the country illegally, he said. Funding request . Obama's emergency funding request seeks $1.6 billion to bolster customs and border efforts as well as crack down on smugglers. Another $300 million would go to help Mexico and Central American governments counter claims by smugglers to desperate parents that U.S. officials won't send their children back. ""While we intend to do the right thing by these children, their parents need to know that this is an incredibly dangerous situation and it is unlikely that their children will be able to stay,"" Obama said. The request also includes $1.8 billion to provide care for unaccompanied children crossing the border. The request is about 10% of the $30 billion in proposed border security funding included in the immigration reform bill passed by the Senate but stalled in the Republican-controlled House. Perry said lawmakers aren't going to back Obama's funding request if the government doesn't act to stop policies they see as encouraging children to show up at the border. He told Obama in a meeting that he wants 1,000 National Guard troops deployed to help secure the border, an option Obama seemed less than enthusiastic about. ""What I told him was we're happy to consider how we could deploy National Guard down there, but that's a temporary solution,"" Obama said of his discussion with Perry. ""That's not a permanent solution. And so why wouldn't we go ahead and pass the permanent solution, or at least a longer-term solution?"" It was unclear how much cooperation Obama will get from congressional Republicans on his funding request. A spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner said the request would be considered. Cornyn and Cuellar plan to introduce legislation Thursday to repeal the 2008 deportation hearing law. The bill, Cuellar said, will include protections for children who come to the United States because of concerns about drug or sex trafficking. Democrats want to keep the law intact to ensure that children who deserve asylum receive a full hearing. 5 things you need to know about the immigration crisis .

"Whenever Alex Rodriguez — or his DMs (designated mouthpieces) -- discuss the evil ways of his haters these days, it sounds believable.

I'm not buying any of this, by the way, and neither should you. It doesn't matter that the tongues for those on Team A-Rod are as smooth as Rodriguez's hitting once was while he was evolving into the most prolific slugger of his time, before a five-year slide to ordinary or less. Denial, denial, denial. Not about Rodriguez's likely use of performance-enhancing drugs within the last few years (he has admitted that he used them when he played for the Texas Rangers from 2001-2003).  Team A-Rod has moved around that subject on its tippy toes. They mostly issue denials that Rodriguez isn't into misleading baseball officials, the Yankees, his teammates, fans and even his absolutely pristine self about anything at any time. Just thinking ... Haven't we seen this middle part of a three-station cycle before from Ryan Braun, Lance Armstrong, Rafael Palmeiro, Marion Jones, Pete Rose, Mark McGwire and Michael Vick? Yes, we have, and these figures are among those in the ever-expanding Liars Hall of Fame. For induction, you must ace the ability to move quickly from The Accusations to The Denial, and before you reach The Confession, you must challenge the world record of politicians for denying and denying some more. ""I did not bet on baseball."" ""I have never, ever used performance-enhancing drugs. ""Everybody wants to know what I am on. What am I on? I'm on my bike busting my (butt) six hours a day. What are you on?"" ""Let me start by telling you this: I have never used steroids, period. I don't know how to say it any more clearly than that. Never."" ""This is all B.S. I am completely innocent."" ""I take these charges very seriously and look forward to clearing my good name."" If you're keeping score, the authors of those previous whoppers were Rose, Jones, Armstrong, Palmeiro (as he wagged his finger at a U.S. congressman on Capitol Hill), Braun and Vick. What's up with this? ""Athletes get hooked on notoriety and fame. I mean, when is the last time they had to buy a meal or a drink?"" said Patrick Devine, who spent years as a sports psychologist for the Atlanta Braves before returning to private practice. He also serves as a professor at Kennesaw State University in Georgia. Added Devine, ""They think everybody loves them, because there are so many people looking at them as their heroes. ""So, athletes start to think that, because of their great deeds and because of the championships they may have won, the public in the end is going to forgive them for whatever they decide to do."" Opinion: How A-Rod let us down . That's why, after The Accusations and The Denial, members of the Liars Hall of Fame don't bother with The Confession until evidence surfaces to confirm their guilt beyond a shadow of a doubt. Then they throw themselves to the mercy of their fans, but only after they have slashed and burned a bunch of innocent folks along the way. As a result, this Rodriguez thing is about to get creepier, because it feels so much like everything I just wrote. There is Major League Baseball claiming Rodriguez joined 12 other players in purchasing and using performance-enhancing drugs from a clinic in south Florida called Biogenesis.  According to reports, those same baseball officials say Rodriguez tried to hinder their investigation by lying and by encouraging others to do the same. There also are reports from CBS's 60 Minutes that Rodriguez used some of his associates to squeal on other drug-using players in an attempt to cover his pinstripes. Rodriguez denies this. Which brings us to this: Follow the money. The New York Times reported this week that Rodriguez has retained at least six law firms and two public relations firms. Among other things, the paper said those A-Rod entities are trying to prove the Yankees and Major League Baseball are trying to take away as much of what remains of Rodriguez's original $275 million contract as possible. Baseball officials had slapped Rodriguez with a 211-game suspension that would keep the 38-year-old third baseman out of the game until after the start of the 2015 season. He appealed the decision, and it will be months before the results are known. If the suspension is upheld, Rodriguez will lose approximately $34 million of his salary. Until then, when it's raining, we'll have Rodriguez telling us the sunshine is beating against his shades. ""It's the same thing as somebody suffering from alcoholism. Denial,"" Devine said. ""Now, in the case of some of the people we're talking about, they just look at everything (PED use, conniving, lying) as simply, 'This is what I have to do to compete at the highest level,' and in their mind -- morally and ethically -- it's not wrong. It's also like, 'If I do get caught, what's going to happen to me?' I mean, we're eventually going to put Pete Rose in the Hall of Fame, and that sort of thing allows athletes to go into this denial thing along the way to being so convincing. Opinion: Is doping at work and in class OK? ""To them, it's really like that old kid's line you hear: If you start telling a lie long enough, you start to believe it."" Yeah, but the rest of us don't have to believe it.","Terence Moore: As he faces suspension, A-Rod plays martyr besieged by forces out to get him .
He says don't buy it. It's denial common to fallen sports stars, from Pete Rose to Armstrong .
He says in Liars Hall of Fame, first come accusations, then denial, and confession. Why?
Moore: Lying sports stars can't accept fall; think if they repeat lie enough, it'll be true. Don't buy it ."
"After helping the Brooklyn Nets to relocate from New Jersey to his hometown borough this season, Jay-Z announced Friday that he will be selling his stake in the pro basketball team. Earlier this month, the rapper and entrepreneur launched Roc Nation Sports, a joint-venture sports management agency with Creative Arts Agency. National Basketball Association rules stipulate that agents can't both represent professional athletes and have a stake in a team. For Jay-Z to move forward as an agent, he had to relinquish control of the sports franchise. Jay-Z, whose real name is Shawn Carter, explained his departure in the following statement: . ""Being a member of the Nets organization surpassed some of my greatest ambitions. It was never about an investment; it was about the NETS and Brooklyn. My job as an owner is over but as a fan it has just begun. I'm a Brooklyn Net forever. It's been an honor to work with Mikhail Prokhorov, Dmitry Razumov, Christophe Charlier, ONEXIM Sports and Entertainment, Brett Yormark and all the wonderful people involved in making the Nets first class. My sincerest thanks goes to Bruce Ratner, who first introduced the idea of moving the Nets to Brooklyn. A thank you and deepest appreciation goes to the fans. You are the lifeblood of any team."" The statement continued: ""The Nets have made their mark on the NBA and as they enter a new era, Roc Nation does as well; as we embark on Roc Nation Sports. Our newest endeavor is committed to building the brands of professional athletes as we have done for some of today's top music artists. For Roc Nation Sports to function at its full potential, NBA rules stipulate that I relinquish my ownership in the Brooklyn Nets. It was a tough decision but as I stated earlier, it's not about ownership. Congratulations to The Nets on a great season and making the playoffs! I will always be a Brooklyn Net.""

"Lab results are back in the case of a teenager who died in a police shooting in St. Louis last week, and they show gun residue on the clothing and body of Vonderrit Myers, authorities said Tuesday. The residue was found on Myers' shirt, jeans and hand, according to a release from St. Louis police. Its presence on his hand could mean that he discharged a firearm, was near a firearm when it went off or that Myers touched something with gun residue on it, police said. People shot at close range could also have residue deposited on their hands. Myers was fatally shot Wednesday by a St. Louis officer, who was off-duty but wearing his uniform while moonlighting for a security company. Police have said the teenager fired a pistol three times at the officer. Myers' relatives have said they don't believe that account. The shooting sparked street protests, with residents pointing out similarities to the August killing of Michael Brown in nearby Ferguson, Missouri. Myers and Brown were both 18 and black and killed by white police officers. However, unlike Myers, authorities say Brown was not armed. ""We're done as a police union standing in the shadows in these cases. We are actively defending the officer involved in the shooting,"" Jeff Roorda, business manger of the St. Louis Police Officers Association, told reporters Tuesday. Mother grieves for son killed in shootout . He said the gun residue results on Myers confirm the officer's account of what happened. ""We saw in the wake of the Michael Brown Ferguson shooting that there was a public outcry, fueled largely by agitators in Ferguson where they demanded that police immediately release details,"" Roorda said. ""That happened in this case. Police immediately, as information became apparent and known to them, released these facts. ... Even with that, we still saw violence in the street,"" he said. Myers was struck by seven or eight bullets, St. Louis Medical Examiner Dr. Michael Graham said last week. Police say the officer fired his pistol 17 times.

"(Health.com) -- Some children and teens are more likely than their peers to become addicted to the Internet, and a new study suggests it's more likely to happen if kids are depressed, hostile, or have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or social phobia. Teenagers who use the Internet so much that it interferes with everyday life and decision-making may be addicted. Although an Internet addiction is not an official diagnosis, signs of a potential problem include using the Internet so much for game playing or other purposes that it interferes with everyday life and decision-making ability. (The diagnosis is being considered for the 2012 edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the ""bible"" of mental ailments published by the American Psychiatric Association). Past research suggests that 1.4 percent to 17.9 percent of adolescents are addicted to the Internet, with percentages higher in Eastern nations than in Western nations, according to the study published Monday in the Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine. The Internet as therapy . In the survey of 2,293 seventh-grade students in Taiwan, 10.8 percent developed an Internet addiction, which was determined by a high score on an Internet addiction scale. Definitions vary, but an Internet addiction usually includes symptoms such as spending a lot of time on the Internet (especially more time than intended), an inability to cut back on usage, a preoccupation with online activities, and symptoms of withdrawal such as anxiety, boredom, or irritability after a few days of not going online. The researchers from Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, in Taiwan, followed the youngsters for two years and found that ADHD and hostility were linked to Internet addiction in children in general. In girls -- but not boys -- depression and social phobia also predicted problems. Health.com: Therapy that can help depression . Boys were at a higher risk of Internet addiction than girls, and those who used the Internet for more than 20 hours a week, every day, or for online gaming, were at higher risk as well. Michael Gilbert, a senior fellow at the Center for the Digital Future at the University of Southern California's Annenberg School for Communication, says the findings were no surprise. ""The study's indication that children who are hyperactive or diagnosed ADHD are finding an outlet on the Web makes such perfect sense,"" he says, because those children crave the constant stimulation of fast-paced video games and interactive social networks. Health.com: What your teen needs to know about sex . Kids with depression, anger issues, or social problems also turn to the Internet as therapy, adds Gilbert, who was not involved in the study. ""They can take on an avatar or a different identity, and can contact other kids with the same problems and social inadequacies; they don't have to function in conventional social ways."" And while Gilbert is not surprised by the research -- he regularly studies the impact of the Internet and cell phone usage on family relationships -- he says it's important that it is given the attention it deserves. ""I don't get the feeling when I talk to therapists that they really understand the concept of addiction to the Internet,"" he says. ""They think more in terms of pornography sites or gambling sites specifically, but Internet addiction itself is not fully understood yet by the therapeutic community."" What parents, doctors, and teachers can do . Internet addiction may be not as widespread in the U.S. -- or at least not as well recognized -- as in Asian countries. In 2008, for example, a Chinese survey showed that more than four million teenagers spend more than six hours a day online. Health.com: How to care for someone who is suicidal . But if at-risk children -- such as those identified in the Taiwanese study -- are given sufficient time and exposure without careful monitoring, Internet addiction could easily become one of the most chronic childhood diseases in America, says Dr. Dimitri A. Christakis of the Center for Child Health, Behavior, and Development, in Seattle. Our culture practically mandates time online, he says, with Wi-Fi connections in coffee shops and BlackBerries and iPhones that allow Internet access almost anywhere. ""It would be as if we mandated that everyone drink two beers every day or everyone gamble for an hour every day,"" says Christakis. Internet addiction among younger generations may often go unnoticed, however, because parents and pediatricians themselves are using the Web more than they'd like. Health.com: Health hazards hidden in college dorms . Since adolescents cannot easily avoid computers, treatment for addiction cannot simply involve abstaining from the Internet, says Christakis. Parents, educators, and medical professionals need to identify high-risk children early on and monitor their Internet usage to prevent problem behavior from forming. Time on the Internet needs to be monitored as well, especially for children who may be at high risk for addiction because of depression, ADHD, or social problems, says Christakis. ""You can't tell a kid never to use the Internet the way you'd tell an alcoholic never to have a drink again,"" he adds. ""But parents need to be thinking about what types of Internet or online gaming are particularly addictive. Ones that allow for continuous, real-time feedback are particularly risky."" Gilbert says that families should strive to make the Internet a healthy part of their home life. ""Putting the computer in a very public place, like the hallway, can integrate the Internet into normal life, rather than it becoming something you go off and do in secret,"" he says. Health.com: I'm bipolar and struggle with addiction . Teachers and health-care professionals should also take the potential for Internet addiction seriously, according to Christakis, who cowrote an editorial published with the study. ""Our intention in raising this concern is not to be alarmist but rather to alert pediatricians to what might become a major public health problem for the United States in the 21st century,"" he writes.

"(CNN) -- A tropical weather system has moved into the Atlantic from the Caribbean and is near the southeastern Bahamas, according to the National Hurricane Center. But the chance the system will become a tropical depression or storm is somewhat less than before. The center now says the system has a ""medium"" chance of developing into a depression or storm over the next two days. It puts the odds at 40 percent. It's still causing drenching rain and gusty winds for several hundred miles to the east, affecting the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Haiti and the Dominican Republic. The severe weather will probably spread over the Bahamas and Turks and Caicos during the next couple of days, possibly causing life-threatening flash floods and mudslides in mountainous areas, the forecast said. And as the system moves generally westward, at 10 to 15 miles an hour, a big question is how it will affect efforts to contain the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. CNN Meteorologist Sean Morris says forecast models show the tropical wave moving into the Bahamas and across southern Florida this weekend and then re-emerging in the northeastern Gulf. U.S. and BP officials are contemplating trying to permanently seal the crippled well by pumping mud into it through a technique called ""static kill,"" but the timing could be influenced by what the weather does. Bad weather could send ships at the well site back to shore. It also could disrupt booms intended to keep the oil from reaching shore and send skimming ships that collect oil on the surface back to port. Retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen, who's in charge of the U.S. effort, says that if the system becomes a storm, containment and work on a relief well, considered the permanent solution, could be thrown off schedule anywhere from 10 to 14 days. Meanwhile, Caribbean islands have been coping with a deluge of rain. Melina Simeonides, a spokeswoman for Puerto Rico Emergency Management, said the weather forced some road closures. Video from CNN's Univision affiliate in the U.S. territory showed streets overwhelmed by rushing water and some giant sinkholes.

"Authorities were investigating Tuesday whether a concrete-encased body buried in a Georgia backyard is a former Florida journalist who went missing in August. Twin 31-year-old brothers have been arrested on an accusation of concealing the death of another person, said police in Winder, Georgia, where the body was found. William and Christopher Cormier are being detained as the investigation continues, and the twins are known locally for their traveling and playing poker, said Winder Police Chief Dennis Dorsey. An autopsy was being conducted Tuesday to determine if the remains belong to former crime reporter Sean Dugas, 30, of the Pensacola News Journal, who has been missing since August 27, said Pensacola Police Capt. David Alexander. Pensacola detectives were working Tuesday in Winder, Georgia, located about 50 miles northeast of Atlanta. Winder police went to the home of the brothers' father on Monday, acting on information from Pensacola police, Winder Police Chief Dorsey said. The father said his sons arrived from Florida three weeks ago, and the brothers told their father they had been caring for the missing man's dog but ended up killing the dog, Winder police said. The dog was buried in the backyard of a home that the father is renting, Dorsey said. In the yard, police unearthed a body in a plastic storage container that had been encased with concrete, Dorsey said. The body was buried two feet below the surface, Dorsey said. Authorities believe the body was buried about three weeks ago, and the concrete may have been purchased at a Home Depot, Dorsey said. When the two brothers arrived at their father's home during the police investigation, they were detained, Dorsey said. The father hasn't been charged and is cooperating with investigators, Dorsey said. Managing Editor Ginny Graybiel of the Pensacola News Journal said that Dugas worked at the newspaper from 2005 to 2010. ""He started as a clerk and became a police reporter -- along the way he did a good bit of entertainment coverage,"" Graybiel said. ""Sean was a very gentle, good-hearted soul. To be the victim of a crime like this is, of course, something we never could have imagined."" Dugas' girlfriend noticed he was missing August 27 when she went to pick him up at home for lunch that day and found he wasn't home, Pensacola's Capt. Alexander said in a statement. When she returned to the home on September 7, she found it empty except for a television, Alexander said. A man who also lived at the house was gone, police said. The girlfriend reported to police on September 13 that Dugas was missing, Alexander said. More from CNN Justice: . Mother awaits sentence for gluing toddler to wall, beating her .

"(CNN) -- A year ago, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a key section of the Defense of Marriage Act or DOMA, a 1996 law that recognized legal marriage as being between a man and a woman. The June 26, 2013, ruling in Windsor v. United States afforded equal federal rights and protections to married same-sex couples. The ruling made a huge difference for binational gay couples. With DOMA gone, U.S. citizens and permanent residents could sponsor their same-sex spouses for residency in the United States. Before, many same-sex couples had to make an agonizing choice between love and country when a temporary visa for one of the partners expired. CNN spoke with four such couples before and after the historic ruling. Read how they are doing a year later: . Love wins in gay couple's 40-year immigration fight . D-Day . Early last June, Satyam Barakoti, 37, and Tonja Holder, 47, were pondering their options: Start a new life in Barakoti's native Nepal. Or maybe Thailand or closer to home in Canada. But they couldn't stay in Atlanta and raise their child as a legally married couple. They counted down to February 20, 2014, the day Barakoti's U.S. visa was set to expire and she'd have to leave the country. The date hung like a thundercloud over their heads. ""It was D-Day for us,"" Barakoti says. But a year ago on June 26, things brightened. Not long after the Supreme Court ruling, Barakoti and Holder got married in Washington, D.C. They immediately filed a petition with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services for permanent residency or a green card for Barakoti. Barakoti gave birth to a daughter in November and no longer fears being separated from Holder. ""There's no reason it should not go through,"" Holder says of their petition. ""I've changed enough dirty diapers to know how real a family we are."" The couple runs a small business that helps nonprofits with fundraising and grant writing. After the DOMA ruling, they breathed a sigh of relief and were able to devote more time and energy to building their company and raising their daughter. ""It pretty much changed everything for us,"" Holder says. Barakoti no longer looks at a calendar with dread, and February 20 came and went without fanfare. In fact, they didn't even notice. Coming home . Brandon Perlberg, 36, abandoned his law career in New York and moved to London to be with his fiance, Benn Storey, so they could remain together. Storey, 32, is British and his temporary U.S. work visa had expired. Perlberg grew angry that he had to leave his own country to be with the one he loved. He says he was forced into exile because he is gay. ""As an American I felt torn,"" he says. ""On the one hand I love my country dearly, but on the other I deeply resented that we were pushed out rather than afforded the dignity we deserve."" The Supreme Court ruling came more than two years after they left New York. Perlberg and Storey are getting married in October. After that, they can think about moving back to America. ""For the first time in almost 10 years of us being together, we're finally in control of our own destiny,"" Perlberg says. They are planning a trip to New York in July and will test how it feels to be back in America together. Then, they will have to decide where they want to live out their lives. ""Making those decisions won't be easy,"" he says. ""But we're grateful that for once, the decisions most meaningful to us get to be ours to make."" 'Persons non-grata' no more . Like Perlberg, Melanie Servetas, 48, left home to be with her love. She once worked as an executive for Wells Fargo, drove a Jaguar and lived in a three-bedroom house in sunny southern California. She gave it all up so that she could live with her wife, Claudia Amaral, 46. The two were married in Amaral's native Brazil. It took them almost a year, but the two moved back to America in late May. At the Dallas airport, they faced an immigration officer they'd encountered on a previous occasion, when they'd taken off their rings and walked through not as a family, but as individuals. They had always been afraid that because Amaral only had a temporary tourist visa, immigration authorities might suspect her as someone who might overstay her visa to be with her American partner. But this time, they proudly wore their weddings rings and presented their passports as a married couple. ""Thank God for Ms. Windsor,"" Servetas says of Edie Windsor, the plaintiff in the DOMA case the Supreme Court heard. ""The ruling validated us as people, which is ridiculous because who needs to be validated by anybody?"" Servetas says. ""Until that day last year, we were second-class citizens. We were persons non-grata. Now we have the same rights as anyone else."" Servetas and Amaral have been staying with relatives in Arizona, but they plan to return to Rancho Cucamonga, California, and pick up the life Servetas so loved. The Supreme Court also invalidated California's 2008 voter-approved constitutional ban on gay marriage, otherwise known as Proposition 8. So Servetas and Amaral will be recognized as legally married by the state as well. Last week, the couple found out that the tenant in Servetas' house is leaving sooner than anticipated. Servetas and Amaral got married last year on June 26, the day of the DOMA ruling. They hope to move back into their house on Thursday -- exactly a year later -- when they will be celebrating a double anniversary. Married but single . The week after the DOMA ruling, Ryan Wilson and Shehan Welihindha left for their honeymoon. They chose California. Wilson, 30, and Welihindha, 31, live in Columbia, South Carolina. But they were among the first seven couples to get married in Wilson's native Maryland after the state voted to allow same-sex marriage in late 2012. On their honeymoon, they visited San Francisco and witnessed the first same-sex marriages taking place after Proposition 8 was no more. Then they went on to Napa Valley and Monterey. A hotel where they stayed had champagne waiting for them. That's something most straight newlyweds expect, but for Wilson and Welihindha, it was a new gesture. Back in South Carolina, their marriage is not recognized. At tax time, they found themselves in a dilemma. ""By state standards we are single. By federal standards we are married,"" Wilson says. The returns became complicated. Beyond the headache came the issue of the signature on the state return. How could they say that all the information they had listed was accurate when they felt they were lying about their marital status? ""I signed it as a single,"" Wilson says. ""But that's not true. So for me, it was a difficult ethical question. I did lie on the form because the state required me to."" On the upside, like all other binational same-sex couples, Wilson and Welihindha no longer have to consider Canada as an option after Welihindha's student visa expires. He is Sri Lankan, and after he gains permanent residency as a spouse, he will be able to obtain a job here. The best thing, they say, is they can live like any other couple. Not yet in South Carolina, but somewhere in the 19 states that now recognize same-sex marriages.

Fox, a third-year drama student at the prestigious performing arts school in Manhattan, was 21 when she went missing. Her roommate told authorities she was last seen leaving their apartment with her keys and a pink portable CD player. It is not clear what prompted officials to investigate the chain.

"If you're holding onto the stereotype about foolhardy teens fiddling with their smartphones while driving, you might want to look at yourself first. In a new survey by AT&T, almost half of adults admitted to texting while driving, compared to a slightly smaller number of teens who fessed up to the same thing. About 49% of adults say they've sent a text while behind the wheel, according to a new survey conducted for the mobile company, compared with 43% of teens in a survey from last April. And here's the thing -- they all know it's wrong. A full 98% of respondents said they're aware that texting and driving isn't safe. The report is part of AT&T's ""It Can Wait"" campaign, designed to discourage texting while driving. Started in 2009, the campaign was ramped up last year with a series of somber TV ads featuring people who were injured, or the families of drivers who were killed, in car accidents in which a driver was using a phone. ""Through the It Can Wait movement, AT&T is collaborating with employers, nonprofits, law enforcement, educators, legislators, professional associations and government agencies nationwide,"" said Cathy Coughlin, AT&T's global marketing officer, in a written statement.  ""I'm confident, together we can save lives by encouraging millions more to make the personal commitment never to text and drive."" Despite the broad awareness about the dangers of texting behind the wheel, the survey suggests that the problem is getting worse. Six out of every 10 respondents said that, three years ago, they never texted while driving. And 40% of the people who admit to texting in the survey say it's a habit, not just an occasional slip-up. Drivers who are texting are 23 times more likely to get into an accident than other drivers, according to the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute. The report comes as National Distracted Driving Month is set to begin on Monday. AT&T is urging employers to start programs encouraging workers to take no-texting pledges. The recent survey was of 1,011 adult drivers in the U.S. who own cell phones. The teen survey was conducted last April with 1,200 drivers between 15 and 19 years old.","AT&T report says almost half of adults admit they text while driving .

"For the first time, the United States is publicly accusing China and Russia of being the top offenders in the theft of U.S. economic and technology information, according to an intelligence report released Thursday. The two countries are ""trying to build their economies"" on American research and development, said Robert Bryant, the National Counterintelligence Executive whose office wrote the report. That office is responsible for mounting an integrated national counterintelligence battle against foreign intelligence threats to the United States, according to its website, and must compile such a report every two years. An unclassified version of the report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage was released Thursday and focused primarily on the exploitation of cyberspace from 2009 to 2011. ""U.S. private sector firms and cybersecurity specialists have reported an onslaught of computer network intrusions that have originated in China,"" said the report. It noted that analysts could not pinpoint specific responsibility for many of the intrusions, but Bryant said the source of the attacks could be government intelligence services, corporations or individuals. The report was more specific about Russia. ""Russia's intelligence services are conducting a range of activities to collect economic information and technology from U.S. targets,"" it said. ""The nations of China and Russia, through their intelligence services and through their corporations, are attacking our research and development.  That's a serious issue, because if we build their economies on our information, I don't think that is right,"" Bryant said at a news conference unveiling the report.  He hoped that by pointing out the problem with the two nations, it will help spur solutions. The latest intelligence community assessment comes on the heels of House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers' harsh criticism of what he referred to as China's ""predatory campaign"" of stealing U.S. intellectual property. Last month, Rogers said the cyber attacks against the United States had reached ""an intolerable level"" and were harming U.S. national security. In a statement released Thursday, Rogers said the report ""once again underscores the need for America's allies across Asia and Europe to join forces to pressure Beijing to end this illegal behavior."" But foreign economic espionage against the United States isn't limited to China and Russia. The report indicates cyber attacks against America have come from dozens of other countries, but it doesn't name those nations. The cost to both national security and private business is said to be considerable but difficult to quantify.  Bryant said U.S. companies and the U.S. government produce approximately $400 billion of research and development each year.  Depending on whose figures you go by, the losses each year range from $2 billion to as much as $400 billion -- estimates that Bryant called ""meaningless."" The report broadly states that if a hostile nation such as Iran or North Korea illegally obtains U.S. technology with military applications, it could endanger American lives. The FBI has prosecuted a number of espionage cases involving private companies, in which the economic impact was cited.  The report gives the example of the Valspar Corporation, where an employee downloaded proprietary paint formulas that he planned to take to a job in China. The theft was valued at $20 million, representing one-eighth of Valspar's annual profit. Tackling the problem isn't easy. Sean Noonan, a tactical analyst for Stratfor, said private companies are often reluctant to report such attacks to the government. ""It's a business issue for these companies. If it goes public, they've seen in the past that it could hurt them, hurt their business more and more,"" said Noonan. He also noted the privacy issues that inevitably arise when the government is involved in cyberdefense measures. Another difficult issue is how much information the government can provide to private industries about cyber attacks without compromising secrets. Roger Kubarych, the national intelligence officer for economic issues with the National Intelligence Council, admitted it's a problem. ""There are going to be limits on how much information and expertise and knowledge the government and its expertise agencies can share with the private sector, but there's more available than there was,"" said Kubarych. A senior U.S. intelligence official, who briefed journalists on the report on the condition of anonymity, said a public-private partnership is the key. ""There needs to be improved threat reporting by industry,cyber and there needs to be communication back by the government to industry as to best practices and how to prevent the theft of significant economic issues,"" the official said. The outlook isn't particularly bright. According to the report, Russia and China will continue to lead the pack in attacking U.S. systems. ""We judge that the governments of China and Russia will remain aggressive and capable collectors of sensitive U.S. economic information and technologies, particularly in cyberspace,"" it said. But the report also warns that changing economic and political developments around the world could lead other nations to steal U.S. economic secrets. There's also the threat of disgruntled insiders within corporations or government agencies leaking sensitive information to activists, who publicly release the information, much like the dissemination of confidential State Department cables on the website WikiLeaks.","Bryant hopes the report will spark solutions .

"(CNN) -- The United States on Thursday expanded a visa ban and set the groundwork for sanctions against Russians and others over the crisis in Ukraine, while Europe also threatened similar action if the matter cannot be resolved diplomatically. The dual action intensified the western response around Russia's military intervention in the Crimean peninsula last week triggered by political upheaval in Kiev. The United States has led the charge on sanctions with Europe seen as a more reluctant partner, at least initially. Russia is the European Union's third-largest trading partner after the United States and China. Germany relies heavily on Russian energy. Visa bans, which were expanded by the State Department, were already in place for some Russian and Ukrainian officials. President Barack Obama also signed an executive order allowing the U.S. government to impose a host of sanctions on both individuals and entities deemed to be violating Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. If Russia continues ""this violation of international law"" in Ukraine, ""the resolve of the United States and our allies and the international community will remain firm,"" Obama said in remarks at the White House. His executive order provides the legal basis for sanctions against specific people and entities, though the United States would do so ""based on the situation on the ground"" in Ukraine, a senior administration official told CNN. It targets those responsible for or complicit in actions that ""undermine democratic processes and institutions in Ukraine,"" the executive order states. No names were revealed, but Russian President Vladimir Putin was not on the list, officials said. Any sanctions would range from freezing assets and blocking property under U.S. jurisdiction to preventing American companies from doing business with any person or entity listed. The Obama administration had previously put trade and investment pact talks with Russia on hold. Separately, Europe also threatened sanctions if the crisis cannot be resolved diplomatically through talks between Moscow and Kiev. The European Council, an arm of the European Union, said it would suspend bilateral talks with Russia on visa matters, and also threatened travel bans, asset freezes and cancellation of the EU-Russia summit if there is no timely diplomatic progress. It also threatened ""severe and far-reaching"" economic consequences if Russia further destabilizes the situation. Also in Washington, a congressional committee was set to vote later in the day on a resolution condemning Russia's actions and urging the United States to pursue a broad range of economic and other sanctions. Military ties, G8 . U.S. action also extends militarily to boost support for allies in the region. The Pentagon added six fighter jets to the four currently on a NATO mission in the Baltics and the guided-missile destroyer USS Truxtun is about to take part in a previously scheduled exercise in the Black Sea. In addition, the Pentagon has suspended military exercises with Russia, and the Obama administration has suspended preparations for the upcoming G8 summit of industrialized nations in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, the site of the just-completed Winter Olympics. Russian lawmakers are drafting a law that would allow the nation to confiscate assets belonging to U.S. and European companies if sanctions are slapped on Moscow, Russian state media reported.

"How is director Zack Snyder's take on Superman in ""Man of Steel"" any different from earlier screen versions? After all, Christopher Reeve created an iconic figure in Richard Donner's 1978 classic (and sequels), while Brandon Routh made an attempt in Bryan Singer's ""Superman Returns"" in 2006. But as composer Hans Zimmer previously hinted to CNN, this Kal-El is a little more spiritual. ""When we started to examine the Superman mythology, in the most classic sense, I really wanted to press upon the film the 'why' of him, which has been 75 years in the making,"" Snyder told CNN. ""The Christ-like parallels, I didn't make that stuff up. We weren't like, 'Hey, let's add this!' That stuff is there, in the mythology. That is the tried-and-true Superman metaphor. So rather than be snarky and say that doesn't exist, we thought it would be fun to allow that mythology to be woven through."" At 75, is Superman still our hero? Snyder starts with the arrival of an infant Kal-El via a miracle birth on his home planet, Krypton. All the other Krypto-babes are genetically engineered, groomed by a process of selection that predetermines their function in society, but Kal-El was made the old-fashioned way, with love. Jor-El, Superman's father (Russell Crowe), helps deliver the child, to emphasize how much the father is involved with the process. But since Krypton is dying and cannot be saved, Jor-El sends this miracle baby to Earth, to save us. ""He will be like a god to them,"" he says at one point. Named Clark, he's raised by humble Midwestern folks Martha and Jonathan (originally Mary and Joseph in the comics). We tend to think of the adult Clark Kent toiling away at The Daily Planet, but this Clark (Henry Cavill) is a manual laborer -- not quite a carpenter, but the parallel is there. ""This character has a balance between the modern world that we live in, and the archetype that exists in this ancient, other way,"" Snyder said. ""I wanted to make it real."" Unlike the Superman of previous films, this take means the world isn't aware of his existence for a long time. Not until he's 33 is Kal-El called upon to sacrifice himself for a world that may not even believe he exists, and he finally reveals who and what he is. Cavill is not strutting around in a Superman suit for a large part of the film -- he's even got a beard for a while. This Clark is more humble, more troubled, more conflicted. As a child, he was even bullied -- and refused to fight back, knowing he would hurt his schoolmates more than they deserved. Of course, it makes him seem weaker than he is and gives him a new emotional template. Lois Lane through the years . ""He's reinvented anew,"" Snyder said. ""He's more down to earth, even though he's also this larger-than-life, impossible figure. Our thesis was, look through Superman's eyes. Feel what he feels. That's where we started, and once you do that, you're in different territory, and that organically changed stuff along the way for us. This exists beyond what I'm going to do here, and what someone else would do beyond me. I really wanted there to be an echo of that throughout the film, and enshrine it for all time."" Krypton is also reinvented, with an opening sequence that lets the audience see more of that world than ever before, including giving General Zod (played by Michael Shannon) and his followers much more of a reason to track Kal-El down on Earth. ""I was really excited to do that stuff,"" Snyder said. ""I love sci-fi, and I wanted this big story to be at the front of the movie and have it be engrossing enough so that when the pod finally crashes on Earth, you go, 'Oh, that's right! We're in a Superman movie. I forgot for a second.' You think during the Krypton sequence, 'Oh! This is the movie, I guess.' "" Snyder says he felt beholden to the Superman mythology that exists in the comics, but he also felt free to mix up characters and situations (i.e., turning Jimmy Olsen into Jenny Olsen). ""I felt it was natural to do that,"" he said. ""We wanted to take this concept of Jimmy Olsen, and not have everything be as exactly aligned as it is. Not everyone has to assume the exact roles that we expect them to. See Amy Adam's transformation . ""The preconceived idea you have about who these characters are -- you can play with it a bit and let the world open up because of that. And then you don't know what's going to happen, because you don't know what your characters are capable of."" Talk of a sequel and a ""Justice League"" film is already under way, and Snyder prepared for this film to fit within a larger canvas. Lex Luthor does not appear, but a LexCorp logo can be found on many a building or construction site that gets destroyed during a showdown with General Zod. Could this be foreshadowing? ""Absolutely,"" Snyder said. Will Luthor be upset that his buildings were damaged, or somehow benefit from the business he'll get from reconstructing Metropolis, setting up a future altercation? ""I like that,"" Snyder said, laughing. ""I'm writing that stuff down to use it later."" And then there's the Wayne Enterprises logo on a satellite, which signals that Gotham and Metropolis can co-exist. ""That was also to thank (producer) Chris (Nolan), for being a great partner and a great friend, and just acknowledge that inside the movie, and like the LexCorp thing, say, 'Maybe this world is bigger than you think.' ""","""Man of Steel"" director Zack Snyder says his Superman is intended to be spiritual .
Snyder says there are Christ-like parallels to the superhero .

"Arizona Sheriff Joseph Arpaio and his attorneys Thursday condemned a U.S. Justice Department civil rights investigation as politically motivated and a ""witch hunt."" That response came after the U.S. Justice Department laid out a stark, detailed list of alleged systematic discrimination against Latinos by Arpaio, who is known internationally as ""America's toughest sheriff"" for his hard-line stance against lawbreakers and undocumented migrants. In alleging the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office committed federal and constitutional violations, a 22-page Justice Department letter described ""a pervasive culture of discriminatory bias against Latinos at MCSO that reaches the highest levels of the agency."" Arpaio responded by telling reporters he had ""an idea of the politics involved in law enforcement"" after 28 years of working with the U.S. Justice Department as a law enforcement official in Mexico, South America, Texas and Arizona. Arpaio is a former agent for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. He pointed out how President Barack Obama opposed Arizona's controversial anti-immigration law now before the U.S. Supreme Court and how the president mentioned Arpaio as the person pushing the law, the sheriff said. ""By the way, I don't want to say it's all politics, but everyone I'm talking about happens to be Democrats,"" said Arpaio, a Republican. Arpaio added: ""Don't come to use me as a whipping boy for a national, international problem."" The Justice Department letter said detention officers in Arpaio's jail invoked offensive slurs and profanities against Hispanics, calling them ""wetbacks,"" ""Mexican bitches,"" and ""stupid Mexicans."" ""Sheriff Arpaio's own actions have helped nurture MCSO's culture of bias,"" said the letter, written to the Maricopa County attorney. For example, the sheriff apparently endorsed one constituent's letter asking for a ""round-up"" at one Phoenix street corner of ""dark-skin(ned)"" people: Arpaio told a member of his command staff in a note to ""(h)ave someone handle this,"" the Justice Department said. Arpaio disputed the Justice Department accusation that systematic civil right violations against Latinos has created ""a wall of distrust"" in the Arizona county. ""I don't know if it's a wall of distrust,"" Arpaio said, adding he holds a lot of community support. ""I have compassion ... I've worked in Mexico City working with the president. I could go on and on,"" Arpaio said. ""But I will tell you one thing: enforcing the law overrides my compassion. I took an oath of office and I'm enforcing the state and federal law. ""I will continue to enforce all the laws,"" he added. Jack MacIntyre, Arpaio's deputy chief, described the Justice Department's allegations as ""a sneak attack by the federal government on the citizens of Arizona."" Arapaio and his attorneys declined to comment on the specific allegations, but lawyer John Masterson said: ""I think it was a foregone conclusion of what they're going to find, and they ended up finding it. ""People have an intention to go out on a witch hunt, and that's what they come up with,"" Masterson added. Arpaio pledged to continue working with the Justice Department in its ongoing investigation. During a press conference earlier Thursday to discuss the Justice Department letter, Assistant Attorney General Thomas E. Perez told reporters, ""We are also reviewing allegations that MCSO has failed to investigate a large number of sex crimes."" The sheriff's office has acknowledged to federal authorities that 432 cases of sexual assault and child molestation were not properly investigated over a three-year period ending in 2007, and many of the victims apparently were Latinos, the Justice Department said. Last week, Arpaio responded to local media accounts regarding the allegedly mishandled sex crime investigations by telling CNN affiliate KNXV:  ""If there were any victims out there, I apologize, if there were any."" The federal findings also alleged discriminatory policing practices by Arpaio's officers including ""unlawful stops, detentions and arrests of Latinos,"" according to a Justice Department statement. It also noted that the sheriff's office has discriminated against ""Latino inmates with limited English by punishing them and denying critical services."" It further blamed the office for allowing ""specialized units to engage in unconstitutional practices"" and for a lack of oversight and deputy training. Perez said the office's ""systematic disregard for basic constitutional protections has created a wall of distrust between the sheriff's office and large segments of the community."" On his government website, Arpaio refers to his renowned nickname and his tough law-and-order posture, which has garnered him international attention: . ""You probably know him as 'America's Toughest Sheriff,' a name given to him years ago by the media. It's a name he certainly has earned as head of the nation's third largest Sheriff's Office which employs over 3400 people. But even before he became Sheriff in 1993, Joe Arpaio was one tough lawman,"" his biography states. But federal authorities offered a different portrait Thursday. ""In short, MCSO is broken in a number of critical respects,"" Perez said. ""The problems are deeply rooted in (Maricopa County Sheriff's Office) culture, and are compounded by (its) penchant for retaliation against individuals who speak out,"" added Perez, who said authorities were also looking at allegations of excessive force and a deliberate failure to provide law enforcement services in select communities. The initial federal inquiry began in June 2008 and reviewed tens of thousands of pages of documents and more than 400 interviews, including current and former inmates as well as office personnel. Authorities notified the sheriff's office of a formal investigation a year later, a statement said. Perez told reporters Thursday that the sheriff's office initially failed to cooperate with investigators, prompting federal authorities to take the ""virtually unprecedented step"" of filing a lawsuit in 2010. He noted the investigation had uncovered startling levels of racial profiling against Latino drivers, ranging between four and nine times higher than against non-Latino motorists. Perez added that an independent reviewer involved in the probe described it as ""the most egregious racial profiling in the United States"" he had ever seen. ""It is clear to me that this community is divided and it is time to heal. It is time to bring the community together around the shared vision of a department that is effective in reducing crime, respects the rule of law and enjoys the confidence of everyone,"" Perez told reporters. Arpaio has long been considered a hard-liner on illegal immigration in a state known for its tough 2010 law on the issue. He's also a well-known and controversial personality, running for his sixth term as sheriff.","NEW: Sheriff Joe Arpaio suggests Justice Department probe is politically motivated .

"A defiant Evo Morales was back in Bolivia on Thursday, railing against the United States after his presidential jet was held up in Europe under suspicions that U.S. intelligence leaker Edward Snowden had hitched a ride. France, Spain, Portugal and Italy refused to let the president's plane fly through their airspace after rumors surfaced that Snowden might be on board, Bolivian officials said. But Spain's foreign minister, Jose Manuel Garcia Margallo, countered that regarding his country, saying in an interview, ""Spain doesn't need to make any apologies. Our air space was never closed."" With no clear path home available, the flight's crew made an emergency landing in Vienna, Austria, where it spent some 14 hours. Snowden rumors temporarily ground Bolivian president's plane . The Bolivians squarely put the blame on Washington for Morales' unexpected side trip. ""Message to the Americans: The empire and its servants will never be able to intimidate or scare us,"" Morales told supporters at El Alto International Airport outside La Paz late Wednesday.  ""European countries need to liberate themselves from the imperialism of the Americans."" Speaking alongside Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa and Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro at a rally in a packed stadium in Bolivia Thursday evening, Morales said officials should analyze whether to shut down the U.S. embassy in his country. The president, who expelled the U.S. ambassador in 2008, said he wouldn't hesitate to boot the embassy, too. ""Without the United States,"" he said, ""we are better politically and democratically."" In several speeches Thursday, Morales said he had been targeted for his indigenous background. ""What happened during these days is not a coincidence, not a mistake like some governments say,"" Morales said. ""It is part of a policy to continue intimidating the Bolivian people and Latin America."" He added, ""Our sin is being indigenous and anti-imperialist."" Despite several attempts by CNN to get a response, Obama administration officials declined to comment on Bolivia's allegations that the United States pressured European countries to deny landing rights to the Bolivian president's plane, referring all questions to the European countries in question. Outrage in Latin America . The incident has sparked a global diplomatic feud that's roiled leaders throughout Latin America. Presidents from five South American countries -- Argentina, Ecuador, Suriname, Uruguay and Venezuela -- met with Morales in Cochabamba, Bolivia, Thursday to discuss the matter. Diplomatic delegations from several others South American nations joined them. The leaders issued a statement condemning the incident and calling for an apology . ""We demand the governments of France, Portugal, Italy and Spain issue the necessary public apology in relation to this serious incident,"" the statement said. The situation, they said, was a flagrant violation of international treaties. ""We reject the actions that clearly violated norms and basic principles of international law, like the inviolability of heads of state,"" they said. The leaders said they supported Morales' complaint to the United Nations High Commissioner of Human Rights over the matter, and they called for their countries' foreign ministers to form a committee to investigate what happened. In a statement Thursday, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for dialogue between Bolivia ""and the European countries that barred the plane carrying President Evo Morales from flying over their airspaces this Wednesday."" According to a statement issued by his office, Ban ""urges the states concerned to discuss the matter with full respect for the legitimate interests involved."" Ecuador's Correa sharply criticized the United States for its role in the situation . In a speech Thursday at the Bolivian rally, he read an excerpt from the U.S. Declaration of Independence and decried what he said was the country's hypocrisy. ""They keep having a double standard,"" he said. Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner said the countries must apologize. ""At least here in South America, when we make a mistake, we recognize it and at least ask for forgiveness from those we have offended. ... Let them apologize for once in their lives for what they have done,"" she said. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro blamed the CIA, saying he believes the agency pressured governments to refuse to allow Morales through their airspace. ""What just happened with the South American indigenous leader Evo Morales shows the level of madness and desperation that the (U.S.) empire has reached,"" he said. Opinion:  Snowden and a muzzled free press . So where is Snowden? The situation is the latest twist in what has become a global guessing game over Snowden's next steps. Snowden has admitted leaking classified documents about U.S. surveillance programs and faces espionage charges in the United States. He has applied for asylum in 21 countries, including Bolivia. Snowden has been holed up at Moscow's Sheremetyevo International Airport since June 23. He arrived from Hong Kong. 'Unbowed' Snowden seeks new havens . Morales, a left-leaning president who has long criticized the United States, had been attending a conference of gas-exporting countries in Russia, where he told the Russia Today news network that he would be willing to consider asylum for Snowden. But Bolivian officials said accusations that an official aircraft would harbor Snowden were baseless. ""We cannot lie to the international community by carrying ghost passengers,"" Bolivian Foreign Minister David Choquehuanca said. Snowden's asylum options dwindle . The fallout . Moscow condemned the nations that blocked Morales' path. ""France, Spain, and Portugal's actions (were) not friendly toward Bolivia and toward Russia,"" the Russian Foreign Ministry said. ""Moscow will demand strict observance of international law ... guaranteeing immunity of heads of state."" France denied it refused to allow the plane to enter its airspace. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius called his Bolivian counterpart to express regrets about a delay in the confirmation to authorize the plane to fly over its territory, the French Foreign Ministry said. The authorization was granted as soon as French authorities were informed the plane was the Bolivian president's aircraft, the ministry said. France ""never intended to deny president Morales' plane access to (its) airspace,"" and the Bolivian leader is welcome in France, Fabius said. France was among the countries where Snowden sought asylum. France said Thursday it had refused the request. Italy also turned down Snowden's asylum request Thursday. ""There are no legal reasons to accept this request,"" Foreign Minister Emma Bonino told the Italian parliament. Meanwhile, in Iceland, lawmakers from several political parties have proposed a new law to grant Snowden citizenship after receiving a request from the former NSA contractor, lawmaker Birgitta Jonsdottir said. On her website, Jonsdottir published what she said was the text of a letter from Snowden. ""I want to extend my gratitude to the Icelandic parliament for considering my request for Icelandic citizenship,"" he said, according to Jonsdottir. ""I have been left defacto-stateless by my own government after communicating with the public."" Iceland has said it can't consider Snowden's request for asylum there until he's in its territory.","Spain's foreign minister says his country never closed its airspace to Morales' plane .

"Tuesday's discovery of rockets hidden in a vacant U.N. facility is the sort of evidence that Israel cites when it accuses Hamas of using civilians and their institutions as shields in the ongoing Gaza conflict. The rockets were found in a vacant school between two other U.N. schools being used as shelters for 3,000 displaced Palestinians, the United Nations said. It was the second such discovery at a vacant U.N. school in Gaza in a week. As suggestive as those discoveries are, Israel's claims that Hamas uses civilians as human shields are difficult to prove in an active ground conflict, experts say. ""It would be impossible at this point to say how much truth there is to the human shield argument,"" said Michele Dunne of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ""That's not going to be possible to do in the heat of the conflict."" It's a war of perception . Possible or not, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu advanced the accusations earlier this week when asked to comment about the brutal conflict, whose death toll has clearly hit Palestinians harder. As of Tuesday, at least 630 Palestinians had been killed and nearly 4,000 wounded; some 70% to 80% of them are civilians, the United Nations said. On the Israeli side, 28 soldiers and two civilians have been killed in the same time frame. Measuring such bloodshed is ""very difficult because Hamas is using them, Palestinians, as human shields,"" Netanyahu told CNN. ""We develop anti-missile systems to protect, we use anti-missile systems to protect our civilians. They use their civilians to protect their missiles. That's the difference."" Those assertions are significant in the war of perception, which is unfolding in tandem with the conflict between Hamas militants and Israel's military, Dunne said. ""There's many different dimensions of this conflict at the same time,"" Dunne said. ""Civilian casualties on the Palestinian side are very high. That is something Hamas can use in the court of public opinion. Israel has to have an answer to that: The civilian casualties are so high because of Hamas, and this is their answer to that."" Civic presence complicates things . What complicates the dispute over alleged human shields -- an offense against international law -- is how Hamas is also a political organization embedded in civilian life in the Palestinian territory, Palestinian leaders say. ""Hamas is a political party after all, not just a military wing. And it has institutions, organizations, homes"" in Gaza, said Hanan Ashrawi, executive committee member of the Palestinian Liberation Organization in the West Bank. That means Hamas is more than its military wing, Ashrawi said. Its members are active in civilian society too. ""Several-story buildings were totally demolished and the people living there. How can you claim that Hamas is hiding anything in there? These are normal residential areas with no military or any munitions hidden there,"" Ashrawi said. ""The question is that Israel is not discriminating, it is destroying the homes of people who are active (in Hamas). Now 'active' could mean you belong to a social service institution. Hamas has day-care centers, has schools, has hospitals; it's a political party as well. It's a movement. ""Hamas is not just an isolated, you know, sort of armed individuals. It belongs to a very pluralistic system. It has in Gaza many services, offices and so on. And therefore if you are going to destroy everything related to Hamas as a party, as a movement, it means that you're going to go on the rampage against families, homes, hospitals, schools and social services,"" Ashrawi said. Population plays a factor . The geography and population density of Gaza further clouds efforts to determine whether civilian casualties are part of Hamas strategy of using human shields or collateral damage from Israel's ground and aerial assaults, Palestinians say. Gaza, with a population of 1.8 million, is a rectangular tract about 25 miles long and just a few miles wide, bounded by the Mediterranean Sea on one side and Egypt on another. A border blockade on Gaza has been in effect for much of the past seven years. High unemployment and extensive poverty afflict the Palestinian territory. In such a place, it's difficult for civilians to hide, Palestinians said. ""The population of (Gaza) -- 43% of it is under the age of 14,"" said Diana Buttu, a human rights attorney who was a legal adviser to Palestinian negotiators. ""It's simply a fact that what the Israelis are doing is they're dropping bombs of a magnitude that we have never seen before on a captive civilian child population."" Israel said it strives to keep Gazans out of harm's way by warning them with leaflets, text messages and phone calls in advance of a military strike. Israel blames Hamas' aggression for putting Gazans in danger. ""They're putting missile batteries next to hospitals, next to mosques, next to schools,"" said Ron Dermer, Israel's ambassador to the United States. ""They're the ones who are putting their civilians in harm's way. ""They're saying, 'Ignore the warnings of the (Israel Defense Forces), stay there,'"" Dermer said. As a result, civilians can become exposed to an Israeli strike. ""They use the strategy of human shields for a reason because they think it works. They think that Israel will be (blamed) for these civilian casualties,"" Dermer said. ""Hamas should be responsible for the use of human shields."" Casualties are inevitable . Israel has accused Hamas of using human shields in previous conflicts in Gaza. Also, in 1982, when Israel invaded Lebanon with the intention of destroying the PLO, it accused PLO combatants of using civilians as human shields in that conflict, too. ""The problem with this particular crisis now is that it's taking place at a time when the whole region from Basra in the east, to Beirut in the west, from Aleppo in the north, to Alexandria in the south, is sliding towards hell,"" said Hisham Melhem, the Washington bureau chief for Al Arabiya News Channel. ""That's one of the reasons, by the way, that you don't see this Arab outcry, because the Arabs themselves are trying to put out fires in their own countries.""

"Former NBA star Dennis Rodman apologized Thursday for his much-criticized outburst about an American citizen imprisoned in North Korea, saying he was stressed out and had been drinking when he made the remarks on CNN. The family of that imprisoned American, Kenneth Bae, said Thursday that they accepted Rodman's apology for his ""outrageous"" remarks but said they hope his comments ""have not further endangered"" Bae. The eccentric basketball veteran is in North Korea for a controversial visit that has been rife with bizarre moments, including Rodman's rendition of ""Happy Birthday"" to the country's leader Kim Jong Un at a packed sports stadium on Wednesday. In an exclusive interview Tuesday with Chris Cuomo of CNN's ""New Day,"" Rodman provoked outrage by appearing to suggest that Bae -- who has been held in North Korea since 2012 -- may have done something to deserve his sentence of 15 years of hard labor. ""I want to first apologize to Kenneth Bae's family,"" Rodman, 52, said Thursday in a statement released by his publicist Jules Feiler. ""I want to apologize to my teammates and my management team. I also want to apologize to Chris Cuomo."" Bae's family had said they were shocked by Rodman's comments about the captive American. ""He was in a position to do some good and to help advocate for Kenneth,"" Bae's sister, Terri Chung, said Tuesday. ""He refused to do so. But then instead he has chosen to hurl these outrageous accusations against Kenneth. He clearly doesn't know anything about Kenneth, about his case. And so we were appalled by that."" Rodman attributed his outburst to stress. ""I embarrassed a lot of people,"" said Rodman, who traveled to North Korea with other former NBA players for a basketball game against a North Korean team. ""I'm very sorry. At this point I should know better than to make political statements. I'm truly sorry."" He said the day of the interview had been ""very stressful."" ""Some of my teammates were leaving because of pressure from their families and business associates,"" he said, adding that his dream of ""basketball diplomacy was quickly falling apart."" ""I had been drinking,"" he said. ""It's not an excuse but by the time the interview happened, I was upset. I was overwhelmed."" In a written statement Thursday afternoon, Chung said the Bae family would accept his apology. ""As Rodman has stated, being drunk and stressed is not an excuse for what he said, but we acknowledge he is human and we all do make mistakes,"" the statement said. ""Our greatest concern remains the health and freedom of my brother Kenneth. We hope and pray that Rodman's comments and ongoing antics have not further endangered my brother. Kenneth's health and freedom are precarious."" Human rights criticism . The NBA and the U.S. government have said they have nothing to do with Rodman's visit to North Korea, his fourth in less than a year. The Irish online betting company that had backed the trip withdrew its name from the venture last month after North Korea announced that Kim's once powerful uncle had been purged from his top government posts and executed. Human rights activists have criticized Rodman for his chummy relationship with Kim and apparent unwillingness to address the North Korean regime's widely reported abuses against its impoverished population. Rodman befriended Kim, an avid basketball fan who inherited power from his father, during his first North Korean visit last year and has described the young dictator as a ""very good guy."" The two unlikely comrades appeared to be getting along famously at the basketball exhibition game Wednesday for Kim's birthday. The young leader, whose exact age is unknown, is believed to be in his early 30s. ""It was, as you might imagine, a bizarre and unusual occasion that won't easily be forgotten,"" Simon Cokerell, general manager of Koryo Tours, said in a YouTube video posted after he accompanied Western tourists to watch the event. Birthday ball game . Accompanied by his wife, Kim emerged in the stadium in Pyongyang to cheering crowds who for several minutes wished him a long life, stopping only when the leader hushed them. Rodman gave an impromptu speech and then led the crowd in singing ""Happy Birthday"" to Kim. Images released by The Associated Press also showed Rodman appearing to bow to Kim. Rodman's squad and a North Korean team played two games, Cokerell said. In the first contest, the Americans lost to a North Korean squad, 47-39. The second game pitted squads with Western and North Korean players on each team. ""That game was actually much better; there was a lot of showboating, showing off, alley-oops, slam-dunks and that sort of thing,"" he said. Rodman, who during his professional career set an NBA record for rebounds, didn't play the whole time, according to Sean Agnew, a tourist who said he had attended the unusual sporting event with Koryo Tours. After participating for about 15 minutes, Rodman got changed and went to sit next to Kim in the audience, where the two spent the rest of the game smoking and laughing together, Agnew said. ""Kim Jong Un really seemed to be enjoying himself,"" said Agnew, who arrived in Beijing from Pyongyang on Thursday. Next move uncertain . The next phase of Rodman's visit remained unclear Thursday. Feiler, the publicist, said he couldn't disclose when Rodman would return to the United States. One of the other former NBA players involved in the game, Eric ""Sleepy"" Floyd, flew to Beijing on Thursday, but there was no sign of Rodman at the airport. ""It was fun, a lot of fun,"" Floyd said of the North Korean visit, before he was engulfed by a throng of journalists at the airport. Agnew, who stayed in the same hotel in Pyongyang as Rodman's team, said he thought that the U.S. basketball players remaining in North Korea might be going skiing. North Korean state-media recently published photos of Kim riding a ski-lift in a newly developed ski resort. Outburst on CNN . Regardless of his next move, the shock waves from Rodman's bizarre performance during his CNN interview on Tuesday continue to reverberate. Most striking were his comments on Bae, a Korean-American who was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor last year on charges that he planned an operation to topple North Korea's government through religious activities. The regime accused Bae of urging people to carry out ""hostile acts"" against the state. Bae's family members say he is a devout Christian who ran a legal tour operation in North Korea but didn't fully understand the system there. His health has deteriorated during his detention and he was transferred to a hospital last year. The U.S. government has repeatedly called on North Korea to grant Bae amnesty and release him. But in his interview with CNN, Rodman intimated that Bae might have done something wrong without specifying what. ""Do you understand what he did in this country?"" Rodman asked Cuomo. ""No, no, no, you tell me, you tell me. Why is he held captive here in this country, why?"" ""I would love to speak on this,"" Rodman said, before abruptly switching topic to talk about how his fellow basketball players had left their families behind to come to North Korea for the exhibition game. Bill Richardson, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations who has visited North Korea, said Rodman had ""crossed a line"" in his comments about Bae. Laura Ling, an American journalist who was imprisoned in North Korea for several months in 2009, said Rodman's remarks were ""incomprehensible.""","Family accepts Rodman apology for ""outrageous"" remarks .

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- Thousands of Chinese demonstrators crowded the streets of Urumqi in western China on Thursday to protest what they say is a lack of police protection, witnesses said. Chinese soldiers have been recently deployed on the streets of Urumqi  in northwest China. Over the past month, more than 400 ethnic majority Han Chinese have been stabbed with tainted syringes by Uyghurs, the Muslim minority, according to local news reports. The stabbings fueled Thursday's protests by Han Chinese in the capital of China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. Many of those attacked with the hypodermic needles were hospitalized, but there have been no reports of deaths, the reports said. Fifteen suspects have been detained for allegedly carrying out the stabbings, a senior official said Wednesday, according to China's state-run Xinhua news agency. Of the 15, four have been formally charged, Xinhua reported. A source told CNN that ""countless"" police and soldiers have deployed to Urumqi and so far, the demonstrations have been peaceful. A local woman told CNN that the stabbings were ethnically motivated and that government text messages to citizens have warned that the syringes contained an unknown disease. Ethnic-fueled violence between the Han Chinese and Uyghurs has plagued Urumqi since July, when soldiers and police stormed the streets to quell riots. Unconfirmed reports of deaths in those riots range from 200 to many more.  Watch a report on the alleged attacks » . An art gallery director in Urumqi told CNN that thousands of people gathered on the streets on Thursday. ""People are protesting here right now. It's all Han people,"" he said, declining to give his name because of safety reasons. ""Since August 3, the Uyghurs have been stabbing the Hans with needles with an unknown virus. People are all very scared."" A spokeswoman for China's Foreign Ministry said she did not know about the protests. ""I have not yet received news of this, but the Chinese government is capable of upholding stability and social unity,"" Jiang Yu said. A receptionist at a bank in the area also told CNN about the protests. ""I heard that today, even during the protest, some people got stabbed, too. People are angry that the government is not doing much against the Uyghurs' needle stabbing,"" said the woman, who also was afraid to give her name.","Report: Stabbings occurred in China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region .

"North Korea's saber rattling again shook the world Wednesday. Pyongyang vowed to shut down a key military hotline with South Korea. It was another day of hostile, over-the-top rhetoric from the reclusive, impoverished nation led by Kim Jong Un. But the recent missile and nuclear tests, and the annulment of the 1953 Korean War armistice are raising questions about the young leader. Is his behavior erratic or staged? Is he competent enough to run a government? Pyongyang watchers, reading the news and the tea leaves, say the latest hot air wafting over the Korean Peninsula could reflect an effort to prop up appeal and allegiance for Kim. Is the warlike rhetoric for the folks on the home front? Christopher Hill, a career U.S. diplomat, said the ""prolonged, rather intense"" flurry of tough talk out of Pyongyang shouldn't be ignored, but it could be directed to the citizenry itself. ""I think there's a big element of domestic North Korean politics, if one can understand that concept, where clearly Kim Jong Un is not being well received,"" Hill told CNN. ""I think they are trying to kind of boost his status to some sort of wartime leader."" Is this about Kim trying to consolidate power? The UK-based Independent newspaper said Kim is working  ""to shore up his position."" ""Not only must the new 'supreme leader' see off challengers from within North Korea's perhaps skeptical military; he must also prove to his brutalized, often starving, people that threats from 'foreign imperialists' must take precedence over, say, early promises of improved living conditions. ""What better than to conduct a nuclear test, and then use the resulting slap on the wrist from the international community as an excuse to ready the troops, tear up the non-aggression pact with Seoul and release incendiary propaganda about, for example, Barack Obama perishing in a nuclear onslaught?"" Is Kim mentally stable? Is Kim insane? David Kang and Victor Cha, writing in Foreign Policy, say ""don't bet on it."" They say he's a contrast to his introverted dad, Kim Jong Il. In power for more than a year, Kim is very much an extrovert who loves to appear in public, watch his beloved hoops and deliver speeches. ""Much of his behavior may be political theater aimed at convincing his own people that the young general is comfortably in charge, but it is also a contrast with his father's ruling style,"" the authors say. ""Kim Jong Il paid no attention to the public aspect of ruling, whereas his son's visibility and embrace of popular culture appears to be aimed at convincing North Koreans that changes may actually occur under him."" Is Kim Jong Un more dangerous than his father? This month, a senior administration official told CNN that Kim Jong Un was ""acting in ways a bit more extreme than his father, who was colder and more calculated."" ""I don't recall he ever went this far in terms of the pace and scope of the rhetoric. Threatening to launch nukes directly against the United States and South Korea confirms what a lot of people have been saying, which is we are dealing with someone new,"" the official added. Another senior administration official said Kim's youth and education abroad offered promise for many North Korea watchers that he would be more willing to engage with the West. ""Unfortunately, he is following the example of his father and grandfather pretty closely,"" the official said. ""It's hard to be optimistic."" His grandfather, Kim Il Sung, was the founding leader of North Korea. Where will he go beyond political theater? Kang and Cha said the question that should be asked about Kim is whether he is turning out to be adventurous or cautious. A risk-taking leader ""may or may not be good for North Korea and its relations with the outside world,"" they say. Any major changes in foreign policy would bring ""enormous hazards."" Domestic, economic and social reforms also involve risks, they said. ""If Kim moves beyond the political theater of the past 60 years -- chest-thumping, name-calling, threatening to turn Seoul into a 'sea of fire' -- and actually risks a major military strike against South Korea or even the United States, he is putting his own neck, as well as his country's, on the line,"" they wrote. What if Kim plays it safe? ""A cautious Kim, who simply pursues the status quo, would mean that North Korean policy will muddle along, with no real change to the frustrating, dangerous, decades-long game of brinksmanship,"" they said. What we don't know about Kim . Fred Kaplan, writing in Slate, said Kim Jong Il was schooled to take the reins of power. Kim Jong Un, however, ""is still an unknown quantity."" Kim Jong Un ""had no political or military experience before taking putative control of the army, the party, and the nation."" The young leader ""had little time to learn anything; his behavior is at best hard to read, and at times bewildering."" Kaplan cites an incident last year. President Obama agreed to provide North Koreans with food aid if they suspended missile and nuclear tests. But Kim embarked on a missile test before the food arrived. He touted the act after Obama canceled the food aid and got the U.N. Security Council to condemn the North Korean action. He compares Kim Jong Un to his father and grandfather. Kim Jong Il and Kim Il Sung ""would make a threat, and wait for the enemy (the United States, South Korea, the U.N., or some combination of the above) to offer a bribe in exchange for their forbearance. They would take the bribe -- and they'd forbear,"" Kaplan writes. ""But this new Kim took the promise of a bribe -- then went ahead and carried out the threat anyway, even before the payment, in this case desperately needed food, came through. What the hell?"" People now want to know Kim ""knows how to play his family's game,"" Kaplan said. ""It's always been an odious game, but in the old days, when the father and grandfather were around, it would end with peace, at least for a while, if the west played along,"" he said.

"Hong Kong generally gets a bad rap when it comes to infectious diseases. Grabbing headlines during recent bird- and swine-flu outbreaks, its proximity to Mainland China as well as its unenviable status as the worst-affected city during the 2003 SARS outbreak, Hong Kong has been central to several global pandemic fears in recent years. It hasn't even escaped fictional outbreaks -- the 2011 movie ""Contagion"" had patient zero Gwyneth Paltrow bring back an unwelcome souvenir from a business trip to the city. But this bad biological baggage may come in handy. The unwelcome distinction of being home to over one fifth of the world's SARS cases, and two fifths of the 774 fatalities from SARS meant Hong Kong quickly developed and implemented a very sophisticated disease control and epidemiology infrastructure. At its most visible, any visitor arriving in Hong Kong must pass through heat sensor monitors checking for high temperatures. This knowhow very probably limited the spread of both H1N1 and avian influenza. The lessons learned from SARS, and other outbreaks, has real application helping epidemiologists fight the spread of infectious diseases worldwide. And now the lessons learned from SARS are being put to the test. Middle East threat . The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first reported to cause human infection in September 2012, and since then has caused over 100 fatalities. Despite the death toll, it is not yet a global concern on the scale of SARS, says Marc Sprenger, Director of the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC). ""Even though our understanding of MERS is only a slowly evolving one, we can see important differences between it and SARS,"" he told CNN via email. ""Perhaps the most important one is that MERS is spreading much slower than SARS -- we have not yet seen sustained human to human transmission. ""A similarity with SARS is that both SARS and MERS are zoonotic (when the virus can jump from animal to human) viruses. MERS appears to be a zoonotic virus resulting from multiple introductions and re-introductions into the (human) community."" Single-hump dromedary camels have been identified as the animal from which the zoonisis occurred. Other species may also be carriers. Upswing in case numbers . It is important to draw a distinction between SARS and this newer respiratory disease, not least in terms of efficacy and human-to-human transmission. But a recent, alarming spike, has seen dozens of new MERS cases -- and several deaths reported this week alone -- which could indicate a change in the virus' behavior. The ECDC reported that its April figures -- 217 cases -- were greater than the past two years combined. ""A lot of times these viruses will start in a certain part of the world (like SARS in Asia),"" CNN's Sanjay Gupta explains. ""They don't know exactly how it's getting from camels to humans and while they've found the virus in camels there could be other animals as well, as part of this whole mix. ""It could be camel meat, it could be drinking unpasteurized camel milk -- both those things are common in Saudi Arabia. It could be some fluids from the camel."" Researchers have shown MERS can transmit from human to human as well, but it is ""very difficult for that to happen,"" adds Gupta. While the vast majority of the cases have been confined to the Arabian Gulf, there are recorded deaths attributable to MERS in Malaysia and The Philippines. Two cases have been reported in Egypt. All reported cases originated in the Middle East. Given the connectedness of the modern world, human-to-human transmission means  the spread of the virus could potentially be geographically unlimited. An infected person traveling overseas is a ""real concern,"" says Gupta. ""There is an incubation period; you could be exposed, you could have the virus. You're not yet sick and you get on a plane. That could happen, and in fact it has already happened."" Lessons learned . It is the protocols honed in Hong Kong and around the world following SARS that offer the best way of limiting the spread of coronaviruses. Knowledge is seen as key, with public education -- from hygiene such as hand-washing to preventative measures such as mask-wearing -- key to arresting the spread of coronaviruses. Saudi Arabia is learning transparency is of key importance, recently replacing Abdullah Al-Rabeeah, its secretive health minister, with Adel Fakieh, a proponent of public education and openness. Professor Malik Peiris, Director of Hong Kong University's School of Public Health, says SARS not only took everyone by surprise, it marked the re-emergence of infectious diseases as a major concern. He says in the wake of SARS, not only were resources -- like isolation wards in hospitals -- reallocated to combat infectious diseases like SARS, but as a result Hong Kong has now become a center for infectious disease epidemiology and virology. ""There was also H7N9 (bird flu) which happened on our doorstep and this expertise was heavily utilized,"" he says. ""The HKU group have contributed very significantly to that event and to understanding what's going on there. We have been working on MERS since almost the time it emerged. We have a greater awareness of the emergence of coronoaviruses -- not only in Hong Kong but internationally."" Publicly, education about hygiene and disease containment in Asia and around the world are also much better following SARS. ""The consciousness of hygiene, issues of coughing and sneezing in public, the use of hand wipes and alcohol wipes ... and people wearing masks when they have respiration infection -- importantly, that is not to protect themselves but to protect others (from infection),"" says Peiris. ""These are direct results of SARS."" Developing a cure? Hong Kong and Chinese expertise is not limited to epidemiology and disease control, but also in developing a cure. A team of researchers from Hong Kong and the mainland have developed two antibodies, which they say are ""promising candidates"" to develop a treatment for the syndrome. As reported in the South China Morning Post, the research into antibodies developed at the time of SARS has been invaluable in this case, and models of virus behavior developed during the 2003 outbreak have added to the urgency to develop an antidote for MERS before it becomes even more communicable. ""The MERS coronavirus may undergo further genetic changes and one day become as transmissible as the SARS coronavirus,"" Professor Yuen Kwok-yung, a Hong Kong-based member of the research team and an expert in infectious diseases at the University of Hong Kong told the newspaper. ""Therefore we must prepare for this scenario before it happens."" Hong Kong Centre for Public Health: Advice on prevention of the spread infectious coronaviruses . -- Cover your mouth when coughing or sneezing, and dispose of used tissues in a covered bin. -- Wash hands frequently using soap and water, or use alcohol-based hand sanitizer. -- Seek medical advice if you exhibit symptoms such as low grade fever, sore throat or running nose, or diarrhea. -- If exhibiting symptoms, wear a surgical mask to limit the spread of the virus. -- Avoid contact with livestock, uncooked meat, unwashed fruits and vegetables, or unpasteurized milk. -- Travelers who develop symptoms up to 14 days after their return from affected areas should put on surgical masks, seek medical attention and inform their doctor of their travel history.","Expertise gained in Hong Kong during SARS epidemic helpful in battling MERS virus .

"The Western Australian government killed its first shark over the weekend as part of a controversial culling program that has drawn an angry reaction from conservationists and activists. A spokesman for the Western Australia (WA) government confirmed that a commercial fisherman had caught and shot a three-meter tiger shark one kilometer off Old Dunsborough in the South West region. The government's program of using hooked lines attached to floating drums to cull sharks in its waters follows a spate of fatal shark attacks in the waters off Australia's largest state. Seven people have been killed in shark attacks in WA over the past three years, the government said. The scheme has been denounced by conservationists who say the sea predators should remain protected species. The culling program went ahead after federal environment minister Greg Hunt granted WA an exemption under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act allowing the state to hunt down sharks. The exemption allows it to hunt the protect great white shark, one of the world's largest marine predators. ""To think this shark had been in the water for 12 hours, possibly with a big bleeding hook in its mouth suffering, is just ridiculous,"" Sea Shepherd spokeswoman Rae Threnoworth told CNN affiliate Sky News. The state's premier Colin Barnett, however, said the bait-and-kill policy puts people first. ""I get no pleasure from seeing sharks killed, but I have an overriding responsibility to protect the people of Western Australia, and that's what I'm doing,"" Mr Barnett told a press conference. Opponents have pledged to interfere with the program and Australian media reported that shark cull activists had removed bait from drum lines. The WA Department of Fisheries is currently working on a satellite-linked shark tagging program as part of its research and protection program. Shark Monitoring Network Project Manager Mark Kleeman said the new monitor near the Busselton Jetty, 220km south of the state capital Perth, would allow beach safety authorities to know, through near real-time alerts, if a tagged shark was in the vicinity. ""Expansion of the satellite-linked network is part of a long-term project to improve safety at West Australian beaches, which will also help scientists better understand the movements of tagged sharks through WA waters,"" Mr Kleeman said in a government release. Besides the satellite-linked monitors, there are also approximately 320 seabed monitors located around the South and West coasts that record movements of tagged sharks. Mr Kleeman said each time data was physically retrieved from those monitors it would also help to establish a much broader understanding of shark behaviur and movement in WA waters. ""338 sharks have now been tagged for the ongoing Shark Monitoring Network project and the ongoing tagging program will continue to help provide even more data,"" he said.

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- Having completed his Olympics gold rush, U.S. swimmer Michael Phelps is now poised to make another haul -- this time of the endorsement variety.

"Spike Lee grew up in Fort Greene in Brooklyn. His parents still live there. He still keeps an office there. But it's not the same neighborhood he grew up in, and his feelings about newcomers now inhabiting once-blighted parts of America's most-populous city like Fort Greene slapped many people in the face after the famed director went into an expletive-laced rant during an African-American History Month lecture on Tuesday. ""I grew up here in New York. It's changed,"" Lee said at Brooklyn's Pratt Institute, an art, design, and architecture school. ""And why does it take an influx of white New Yorkers in the South Bronx, in Harlem, in Bed Stuy, in Crown Heights for the facilities to get better? The garbage wasn't picked up every mother******* day when I was living in 165 Washington Park. ... The police weren't around. When you see white mothers pushing their babies in strollers, three o'clock in the morning on 125th Street, that must tell you something."" Mitchell Moss, a professor of urban policy and planning at New York University's Wagner School of Public Service, said the city has witnessed an enormous recovery since 2001, and the greatest change has been felt in Brooklyn, which has drawn newcomers because of its housing, access to Manhattan and improved safety. ""Cities don't stand still, and the cities that stand still are Detroit,"" Moss said. ""So if Spike Lee wants to see a place where there is no gentrification, he'll also find a place where there are no investments. Obviously, he's someone who knows how to make a movie but doesn't know anything about cities."" He added: ""Brooklyn has become more attractive to more people. Of course, that means some people are going to have to find other places to live, but that's the magic of New York. We create new places. Today, Bushwick, which was an area that people were afraid to go to, now has some of the best restaurants in the city."" The new neighbors complain . ""Let me just kill you right now,"" Lee, the ""Do The Right Thing"" director, told D.K. Smith, a Brooklyn homeowner and tech start-up director, at the speech when Smith brought up the subject of the ""other side"" of gentrification. And then he launched his lengthy tirade. On Wednesday, Lee told ""Anderson Cooper 360"" that he's not against new people moving into areas that were once predominantly poor and predominantly African-American. ""My problem is that when you move into a neighborhood, have some respect for the history, for the culture,"" Lee said. Smith, the managing director of the start-up Brooklyn Innovation Center, told CNN that he doesn't mind that Lee ripped into him and wouldn't let him interject. Smith told Lee on Tuesday that he didn't dispute his point that services in the neighborhoods had changed after the new people -- most of whom are white -- moved in. ""Whoa, whoa, whoa..."" said Lee. ""Let me kill you some more."" ""Can I talk about something?"" Smith said. ""Not yet. Then comes the mother******' Christopher Columbus Syndrome. You can't discover this! We been here,"" he said to applause from the audience. He gave the examples of people playing drums in Mount Morris Park, a tradition he said lasted 40 years until the new residents complained. And then there was the one that literally hit home. Lee said his father, ""a great jazz musician,"" bought a brownstone 46 years ago. ""And the mother******' people moved in last year and called the cops on my father. He's not — he doesn't even play electric bass. It's acoustic. We bought the mother******' house in 1968, and now you call the cops? In 2013?"" According to a New York Times article, police have received 17 noise complaints. The Times said a woman who lived next door had called most. Lee: Why are the services finally better? Lee lamented that Fort Greene Park in the morning resembled the Westminster Dog Show with hip dogs and that real estate brokers and ""mother******* hipsters"" conspired to change the names of neighborhoods like the South Bronx to SoBro or Bushwick to East Williamsburg. ""So, why did it take this great influx of white people to get the schools better?"" Lee asked. ""Why's there more police protection in Bed Stuy and Harlem now? Why's the garbage getting picked up more regularly? We been here!"" Smith couldn't get a word in during Lee's speech Tuesday night. But the next day he said he was glad the filmmaker got people talking about the issue. ""What I wanted to do was expand the dialogue,"" he told CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront."" There is another side, resident says . But Smith said there was a definite lack of balance in Lee's rant. ""I'm black, and America is America,"" he said. ""I don't need to moan and groan about it all the time. And some things are bigger than Bed Stuy or Fort Greene or being black in Brooklyn. Gentrification is an issue everywhere. It gets right down to the whole economic scene with the super rich, the 1%, and then the other 99 % of us."" Smith said that when he bought his parents' four-story brownstone in 1989, he thought he'd be lucky to one day get $450,000 for it. ""We passed that some time in the '90s,"" he said. ""I'm personally tired of moaning and groaning about being black,"" he said. ""Here's a case where it has its advantages -- for the first time tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of blacks can participate in American wealth creation. My God, that's what this country is all about."" Referring to reports that Lee's 9,000-square-foot mansion on Manhattan's Upper East Side is on the market for $32 million, Smith said: ""Spike is a causative factor in gentrification. If Spike moves to a swamp ... that land next door goes up immediately."" But Smith doesn't disagree entirely with Lee. ""I've had incidents with the dogs of new owners crapping on the sidewalks. They don't think anybody lives there,"" he said, adding that most are ""wonderful new neighbors."" Lee didn't dispute to Cooper that gentrification brings rising home prices, but he worried about what became of the people who were priced out of the neighborhood. ""There's good. But what cost? If we lose half of the African-American population, in my neighborhood, Fort Greene, and the schools become better, what happened to half the people that left?"" And he was angry that city services improved when the neighborhood profile changed. ""I just find it interesting you have to have an influx of white New Yorkers to move into these neighborhoods for the services to go up, for the schools to be better,"" he told CNN. ""They get better sanitation, get more police protection. Why didn't that happened before gentrification? We're still paying taxes. We're still New Yorkers.""

"London (CNN) -- WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is ""in the process of making arrangements"" to meet with British police regarding a Swedish arrest warrant, his attorney said Monday. Assange is wanted for questioning by Swedish authorities over sex-crime allegations unrelated to WikiLeaks' recent disclosure of secret U.S. documents. Mark Stephens, his British lawyer, told the BBC no time had been set for the . meeting as of Monday evening, but one is likely ""in the foreseeable future."" ""We are in the process of making arrangements to meet with the police by consent in order to facilitate the taking of that question-and-answer as needed,"" Stephens said. Assange, a 39-year-old Australian, has said he has long feared retribution for his website's disclosures and has called the rape allegations against him a smear campaign. Sweden issued an arrest warrant for Assange in November, saying he is suspected of rape, sexual molestation and illegal use of force. The warrant was followed last week by a ""Red Notice"" from Interpol, placing Assange on a list of wanted suspects at the request of Sweden's Stockholm Criminal Court. British police then asked Swedish authorities for additional details not specified in the initial arrest warrant, a possible indication that the location of the elusive Assange is known. CNN has not confirmed that Assange is in the United Kingdom. Swedish prosecutors said Monday that they had sent additional information the British requested and that the case was being handled in accordance with European laws. WikiLeaks, which facilitates the anonymous leaking of secret information, has been under intense pressure from the United States and its allies since it began posting the first of more than 250,000 U.S. State Department documents November 28. Since then, the site has been hit with denial-of-service attacks, been kicked off servers in the United States and France and found itself cut off from funds in the United States and Switzerland. In response, the site has rallied supporters to mirror its content ""in order to make it impossible to ever fully remove WikiLeaks from the internet,"" with more than 500 sites responding to the appeal by Monday evening, it said. Supporters have rallied on the microblogging site Twitter as well. Victoria Wang, a software designer in suburban Chicago, said government efforts to squelch WikiLeaks risk a backlash among younger, tech-savvy Americans. She called government efforts to shut down the site ""embarrassing."" ""Now that the information has already been leaked, it becomes more of a free-speech issue,"" Wang said. Most reviews of the documents have failed to turn up many surprises so far, she said -- ""That's why I feel like the censorship is a bigger issue."" In addition, WikiLeaks has posted a massive, closely encrypted file, identified as ""insurance"" -- a file Assange's lawyer has described as a ""thermonuclear device."" Assange has said the more than 100,000 people who have downloaded the file will receive the key to decoding it should anything happen to him or should the site be taken down. Ira Winkler, a former National Security Agency analyst, said the file is nearly impossible to decode without the key. ""If you don't have the password, there are trillions of potential options of recovering the data,"" he said. ""You have to go through trillions and trillions and trillions of options to actually get the right sequence of characters back. So that's why the password is so important."" But in Washington, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said he has authorized ""significant"" actions related to a criminal investigation of WikiLeaks. ""National security of the United States has been put at risk,"" Holder said. ""The lives of people who work for the American people have been put at risk. The American people themselves have been put at risk by these actions that I believe are arrogant, misguided and ultimately not helpful in any way. We are doing everything that we can."" Holder declined to answer questions about the possibility that the U.S. government could shut down WikiLeaks, saying he does not want to talk about capabilities and techniques at the government's disposal. Nor would he say whether the actions involved search warrants, requests under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which authorizes wiretaps or other means, describing them only as ""significant."" ""I authorized just last week a number of things to be done so that we can, hopefully, get to the bottom of this and hold people accountable as they should be,"" he said. In Switzerland, meanwhile, WikiLeaks said in a press release that the bank Swiss PostFinance decided to end ""its business relationship"" with Assange based on a ""technicality."" The bank said Assange listed Geneva as his home and ""upon inspection, this information was found to be incorrect."" ""Assange cannot provide proof of residence in Switzerland and thus does not meet the criteria for a customer relationship with PostFinance,"" the bank said. WikiLeaks' statement said Assange used his lawyer's address in Geneva for bank correspondence. The account closure -- coupled with the decision by U.S.-based website PayPal to cut off online donations to WikiLeaks last week -- has resulted in losses of 100,000 euros (U.S. $133,000) in assets, WikiLeaks said. And in Assange's native Australia, meanwhile, Prime Minister Julia Gillard told reporters Tuesday that police were investigating whether any of her country's laws were broken. But she WikiLeaks was ""grossly irresponsible"" to have distributed the documents, which a U.S. soldier based in Iraq is suspected of providing to them. ""I've been asked about this matter a number of times, and I want to be clear about my attitude to it,"" she said. Publishing the documents ""is an illegal act that certainly breached the laws of the United States of America. The individual involved, there are potential matters arising from Sweden and the warrant there,"" she added.

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- The Indonesia volcano that threatened President Obama's visit is now ""likely"" to shorten an already brief stop to the capital city of Jakarta. Obama arrived in Indonesia, where he spent part of his childhood, on Tuesday for a two-day trip. White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, who earlier told reporters that officials were closely monitoring the ash cloud from Mount Merapi, said forecasting shows air traffic might again be disrupted. Obama is scheduled to meet with Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and hold a news conference with him; attend an official dinner; and visit the Istiqlal Mosque, the largest mosque in southeast Asia. Gibbs said the President still hopes to deliver a speech at the University of Indonesia. ""My sense is, our hope is that while we may have to truncate some of the morning we can get the speech in,"" Gibbs told reporters aboard Air Force One on a flight from New Delhi to Jakarta.. Ben Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser for strategic communications, said earlier that Obama lived in Jakarta for several years as a boy. In the university speech, ""he'll have a chance to talk about the partnership that we're building with Indonesia ... [and]also to talk about some of the themes of democracy and development and our outreach to Muslim communities around the world, while also speaking of Indonesia's pluralism and tolerance as well,"" Rhodes said ahead of Obama's 10-day tour of Asia. ""While [Indonesia is] a Muslim majority, it's a host to a broad religious diversity,"" Rhodes added. On Sunday, Muslims staged rallies across Indonesia to protest Obama's visit to the world's largest Muslim-majority nation. ""We don't see the differences between Obama and Bush. They both oppress Muslims. They both have blood on their hands,"" said Ismail Yusanto, a spokesman for the Muslim group Hizbut Tahrir. ""That's why we reject Obama and we don't believe that he's reaching out to Muslims."" About 20,000 people attended the rallies, the spokesman said. More than one in 10 of the world's Muslims live in Indonesia, which has about 205 million Muslims. Obama's trip to Asia started Saturday with a three-day visit to India. His stay in India -- the third largest economy and one of the world's few growth markets -- included a meeting with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in New Delhi and an address to the nation's parliament. In another major sign of growing ties between India and the United States, Obama on Monday backed a permanent seat for India in the U.N. Security Council. ""In the years ahead, I look forward to a reformed U.N. Security Council that includes India as a permanent member,"" he said to India's parliament. The statement came as Obama made a wide-ranging address that envisioned closer economic and security ties between the United States and India, standing ""shoulder to shoulder"" with the world's largest democracy. Obama praised India's democratic institutions: its free electoral system, independent judiciary, the rule of law, and a free press. He said India and the United States have a unique link because they are democracies and free-market economies. ""When Indians vote, the whole world watches. Thousands of political parties. Hundreds of thousands of polling centers. Millions of candidates and poll workers, and 700 million voters. There's nothing like it on the planet. There is so much that countries transitioning to democracy could learn from India's experience; so much expertise that India can share with the world. That, too, is what's possible when the world's largest democracy embraces its role as a global leader,"" he said. Noting the country's rise as a world power, Obama said he sees the United States cooperating with India in various international and regional alliances. He praised India's role in the climate change negotiations and its role as a top contributor in U.N. peacekeeping missions. Obama's visit to India included a town hall-style meeting with students, a celebration of the Hindu holiday Diwali and a visit to Humayun's Tomb, an architectural precursor to the Taj Mahal. On Wednesday, the president will leave for South Korea, where he will attend the G-20 summit in Seoul. Obama is to meet with Chinese President Hu Jintao while both are in South Korea. The U.S. president also is to deliver a speech to U.S. troops in South Korea on Thursday, which is the Veterans Day holiday in the United States. Obama's Seoul visit will include a meeting with South Korean President Lee Myung-bak and a news conference. The U.S. president will leave South Korea for Japan on Thursday. In Japan, Obama will speak at a CEO Business Summit that is part of an Asia-Pacific Economic Council summit. Obama's packed schedule includes other APEC events and bilateral talks with Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard. The president's Asia tour is part of an administration focus on a vital region for expanding trade and fighting terrorism, Rhodes said ahead of the trip. ""If you look at the trend lines in the 21st century, the rise of Asia, the rise of individual countries within Asia, is one of the defining stories of our time,"" Rhodes said, later adding, ""We see core U.S. national interests that will be advanced by us playing a key role in helping to shape the future of the region and making clear that we're an Asian and a Pacific power."" Obama will head back to the United States on Sunday. CNN White House correspondent Dan Lothian contributed to this report.","NEW: Obama could leave Indonesia early due to Mount Merapi eruptions .

"Washington (CNN) -- Five people, including three police officers, have been indicted on charges related to the beating death of a Latino man in rural Pennsylvania in July 2008, the Justice Department said Tuesday. Two indictments charge the five with federal hate crimes, obstruction of justice and conspiracy in what authorities are calling a racially motivated attack. The indictments come almost six months after a Schuylkill County jury acquitted two teens of aggravated assault and one of murder in the death of Luis Ramirez. The undocumented Mexican immigrant was beaten into a coma during a street brawl involving the teens and their friends on a residential street in Shenandoah. The incident divided the small, rural mining town along racial lines and became a flash point for racial tensions nationwide. After the verdict, Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell denounced the attack as racially motivated and called on the Justice Department to intervene. A federal grand jury handed up the indictments last week, and they were unsealed Tuesday. The two young men, Derrick Donchak and Brandon Piekarsky, are accused of a hate crime for beating Ramirez while shouting racial epithets at him, according to the department. If convicted of hate crime charges, Donchak and Piekarsky face a maximum penalty of life in prison. Donchak also faces a maximum of 20 years in prison if convicted of obstruction, and an additional five years on the charge of conspiring to obstruct justice. Donchak also faces three counts of conspiring to obstruct justice and related offences. He is accused of attempting to orchestrate a coverup with members of the Shenandoah Police Department, the Justice Department said. Shenandoah Police Chief Matthew Nestor and Lt. William Moyer and Officer Jason Hayes are charged with conspiring to obstruct justice in the Ramirez investigation. Moyer faces additional charges of witness and evidence tampering and making false statements to the FBI. Nestor, Moyer and Hayes intentionally failed to ""memorialize or record"" statements made by Piekarsky about the incident, and ""wrote false and misleading official reports"" that ""intentionally omitted information about the true nature of the assault and the investigation,"" the indictment said. Nestor, Moyer and Hayes each face up to 20 years in prison on each of the obstruction charges if convicted, authorities said, along with an additional five years on the charges of conspiring to obstruct justice. Moyer faces an additional five years if convicted of making false statements to the FBI. At the time of Ramirez's death, Hayes was dating Piekarsky's mother and Moyer's son was a high school freshman who played football with the youths involved in the attack, according to the indictment. State prosecutors alleged that a group of teens including Donchak and Piekarsky, then 19 and 17, baited Ramirez into a confrontation after a night of drinking. Donchak and Piekarsky were walking home from a local festival when they encountered Ramirez and attacked him, ""striking and kicking him while members of the group yelled racial slurs at him,"" the Justice Department said. Prosecutors alleged Piekarsky delivered a fatal kick to Ramirez's head after Ramirez was knocked to the ground. A medical examiner ruled Ramirez died from blunt-force trauma to the head. In June, an all-white Pennsylvania jury acquitted Piekarsky of third-degree murder and convicted him and Donchak of misdemeanor simple assault. The two were also found not guilty of aggravated assault, ethnic intimidation and hindering apprehension. Donchak was convicted of corrupting minors for providing the alcohol to his friends before the fight. The two were sentenced to up to 23 months in the county jail. After the verdict, Rendell sent a letter to U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder recommending the Justice Department pursue civil rights charges. ""The evidence suggests that Mr. Ramirez was targeted, beaten and killed because he was Mexican,"" Rendell wrote. ""Such lawlessness and violence hurts not only the victim of the attack, but also our towns and communities that are torn apart by such bigotry and intolerance."" Gladys Limon, an attorney representing Crystal Dillman, Ramirez's fiancee, said Dillman welcomes the indictments, but remains fearful for her safety. Dillman has moved to an undisclosed location outside Shenandoah. Her truck was vandalized, and some people have yelled racial epithets at her on the streets, the attorney said. ""She is overwhelmed and is feeling a range of emotions,"" Limon said. ""His family has suffered a great deal in the past year."" It has been particularly hard for Ramirez's family as the holidays approach, she said. ""The children miss their father. Crystal misses having him around for the holidays,"" Limon said. ""Crystal says this is a gift from God, that this will bring justice to Luis."" A petition calling for federal charges in the case garnered 50,000 signatures, Limon said. A hearing in the case was scheduled for Tuesday afternoon in federal court in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. ""The FBI wants to hear from anyone who may have information regarding alleged civil rights violations or public corruption in Schuylkill County,"" the Justice Department said Tuesday. Those with information can contact the Allentown, Pennsylvania, FBI office.

"(CNN)The Civil Rights Act of 1964 -- hailed by some as the most important legislation in American history -- was signed into law 50 years ago Wednesday. It was known as the ""bill of the century."" But many Americans today probably couldn't say exactly what the legislation accomplished. ""It's really the law that created modern America,"" said Todd S. Purdum, author of ""An Idea Whose Time Has Come."" ""Its goal was to help finish the work of the Civil War, 100 years after the war had ended, and to make the promise of legal equality for blacks and whites, even though actual equality is elusive to this day."" The law revolutionized a country where blacks and whites could not eat together in public restaurants under Jim Crow laws, or stay at the same hotel. It outlawed discrimination in public places and facilities and banned discrimination based on race, gender, religion or national origin by employers and government agencies. It also encouraged the desegregation of public schools. ""This did all of those things. It changed everything about ordinary life for black Americans all over the country,""  Purdum said. ""I think when you try to explain to people today -- I have children 10 and 14 years old, and I don't think they can really imagine a world like (this) existed before this law."" The act had the longest filibuster in U.S. Senate history, and after a bloody, long civil rights struggle, the Senate passed the act 73-27 in July 1964. It became law less than a year after President John F. Kennedy's assassination. Read the full act here . Here are a few surprising facts about how the Civil Rights Act of 1964 became law: . 1. More Republicans voted in favor of the Civil Rights Act than Democrats . In the 1960s, Congress was divided on civil rights issues -- but not necessarily along party lines. ""Most people don't realize that today at all -- in proportional terms, a far higher percentage of Republicans voted for this bill than did Democrats, because of the way the Southerners were divided,"" said Purdum. The division was geographic. The Guardian's Harry J. Enten broke down the vote, showing that more than 80% of Republicans in both houses voted in favor of the bill, compared with more than 60% of Democrats. When you account for geography, according to Enten's article, 90% of lawmakers from states that were in the Union during the Civil War supported the bill compared with less than 10% of lawmakers from states that were in the Confederacy. Enten points out that Democrats still played a key role in getting the law passed. ""It was also Democrats who helped usher the bill through the House, Senate, and ultimately a Democratic president who signed it into law,"" Enten writes. 2.  A fiscal conservative became an unsung hero in helping the Act pass . Ohio's Republican Rep. William McCulloch had a conservative track record -- he opposed foreign and federal education aid and supported gun rights and school prayer. His district (the same one now represented by House Speaker John Boehner) had a small African-American population. So he had little to gain politically by supporting the Civil Rights Act. Yet he became a critical leader in getting the bill passed. His ancestors opposed slavery even before the Civil War, and he'd made a deal with Kennedy to see the bill through to passage. ""The Constitution doesn't say that whites alone shall have our most basic rights, but that we all shall have them,"" McCulloch would say to fellow legislators. Later, he would play a key role in the 1965 Voting Rights Act and the 1968 Fair Housing Act and become part of the Kerner Commission, appointed by the Johnson administration to investigate the 1967 race riots. Kennedy's widow, Jacqueline Kennedy, wrote him an ""emotional"" letter when he retired from Congress in 1972. ""You made a personal commitment to President Kennedy in October 1963, against all interests of your district,"" she wrote. ""There were so many opportunities to sabotage the bill, without appearing to do so, but you never took them. On the contrary, you brought everyone else along with you."" 3. Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. met for the first and only time during Senate debate on the act . The two leaders met briefly on March 26, 1964, while they were both on Capitol Hill to hear debate on the 1964 Civil Rights Act. That brief encounter was captured by photographers. ""Well, Malcolm, good to see you,"" King greeted Malcolm X. ""Good to see you,"" he replied. Known for his direct rhetoric in denouncing America's treatment of African-Americans, Malcolm X was a stark contrast to King, who preached tolerance and peace in achieving equal rights. Some scholars say the two could have formed an alliance, as Malcolm X moved away from the Nation of Islam. But it never happened:  Malcolm X was shot and killed less than a year after their first and only encounter. King was assassinated in 1968. 4.  The act didn't help just black Americans . Women, religious minorities, Latinos and whites also benefited from the Civil Rights Act, which would later serve as a model for other anti-discrimination measures passed by Congress, including the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Pregnancy Discrimination Act. Under the Civil Rights Act, women who had been fired because they became pregnant, or were not hired because they had small children, now had recourse. As a result of Title VII, ""male only"" job notices became illegal for the first time. Before the Civil Rights Act, women made up less than 3% of attorneys and less than 1% of federal judges; now they make up nearly a third of lawyers, according to the National Jurist, and three of the nine Supreme Court Justices are women. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission was also created by the law, giving women a workable ""hammer"" with which to shatter the glass ceiling. 5. A segregationist congressman's attempt to kill the bill backfired . Virginia's Democratic Rep. Howard W. Smith was a staunch segregationist and strongly opposed the Civil Rights Act. Smith, who was chairman of the House Rules Committee, came up with many tactics to discourage the passage of the bill's Title VII, which would outlaw employment discrimination because of race, color, religion or national origin. When Smith added the word ""sex,"" the House reportedly laughed out loud. The ploy was Smith's attempt to quash support among the chamber's male chauvinists on the grounds that the bill would protect women's rights in the workplace, according to Clay Risen in his book ""The Bill of the Century."" Despite resistance, and complex motives, the act eventually passed, laying the groundwork for legal battles to ensure equal employment opportunities for women. And whether he intended to or not, Smith ended up helping to set the stage for modern feminism. 6. The 1964 law didn't do much to address discrimination at the ballot box . Black men were granted the right to vote in 1870 under the 15th Amendment (women followed 50 years later). Yet many obstacles -- including literacy tests and poll taxes -- prevented most blacks in the South from casting ballots. Just a few months before the Voting Rights Act, the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was ratified to remove poll taxes as a condition for voting in federal elections. All the 1964 Civil Rights Act did was to mandate the same voting rules nationwide. It wasn't until the following year that the 1965 Voting Rights Act would suspend the use of literacy tests.","Wednesday marks the 50th anniversary of the signing of the 1964 Civil Rights Act .

"(CNN) -- The rapid thud-thud-thud of military choppers overhead on Wednesday was the first thing to catch the attention of the residents of Cuernavaca, a city south of Mexico City known as a retreat for city-dwellers and tourists alike. The helicopters landed near Punta Vista Hermosa, a majestic resort where condos sell for millions of Mexican pesos, and before long, seemingly hundreds of military personnel were on its grounds. A few hours later, a ferocious firefight broke out between the military and a cell of drug traffickers. ""Things like this rarely happen here,"" said Yadira Abigail Flores Delgado, who works at a nearby private security firm. ""I could hear the shots and the helicopters. It was a very ugly incident."" The outcome, however, was sweet for the administration of President Felipe Calderon. In a strong blow to one of Mexico's most notorious drug cartels, Mexico's navy killed Arturo Beltran Leyva, head of the Beltran Leyva cartel and one of Mexico's three most wanted criminals. Six other cartel members and one naval petty officer also died in the raid. Three other people were arrested. The end of Beltran Leyva's reign at the helm of the violent cartel was hailed by Mexico and the United States as a major victory for Calderon's offensive against the cartels, a war that has claimed more than 14,000 lives since 2006. More than 7,300 people have been killed in drug-related violence this year, according to a tally by Mexico's El Universal newspaper. ""This action represents a major achievement for the people and government of Mexico, and is a decisive blow against one of the most dangerous criminal organizations in Mexico,"" Calderon said, speaking from the U.N. Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, Denmark. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration said that its cooperation with Mexico played a role in Wednesday's action. ""[Beltran Leyva's] death has dealt a crippling blow to one of the most violent cartels in the world, and it comes as a result of significant cooperation and information sharing between law enforcement in the United States and our courageous partners in Mexico,"" DEA Acting Administrator Michele M. Leonhart said in a written statement. Video footage of the condo where Beltran Leyva was staying revealed bullet-ridden walls. A plate of eggs and ham was set at the dinner table, which was adorned with two fruit bowls. A large baggie containing a white substance was nearby. On Thursday, authorities presented to the media two women and a man who were arrested in the raid. Their role with the cartel was not made clear. The women were identified as Catalina Castro Lopez and Gabriela Vega Perez. The man's name was not immediately released. It was believed that the raid was linked to another operation last week. On December 11, the navy got into a firefight in Cuernavaca with gunmen of the Beltran Leyva cartel. Three of the gunmen were killed and 11 were arrested, according to the navy. Calderon said Wednesday's operation ""was the result of an intense intelligence effort by the Mexican navy."" ""We've never seen anything like this,"" Flores Delgado said. ""Everyone is scared."" The fear was palpable at a children's hospital right behind the complex where the drug lord was killed. Three military personnel posted themselves inside the hospital hours before the shooting started, saying only that they were in the middle of an operation, said Dr. Antonio Villa Montiel. The shooting started just after 8 p.m. and lasted for about an hour and a half, about 30 minutes of which were very intense, Villa Montiel said. ""There was gunfire, machine gun fire and grenades, some of it very close to the hospital,"" he said. ""Inside the hospital there was much stress, fear and anxiety. Some people even panicked."" Three navy personnel were wounded by hand grenades, one fatally, the navy said. Navy 3rd Petty Officer Melquisedet Angulo Cordova died while being treated for his injuries, navy spokesman Adm. Jose Luis Vergara said. One of the other two navy men was in serious condition and the other was in stable condition, Vergara said. ""It's a battle won, but by no means the war,"" said Tony Payan, associate professor of political science at the University of Texas-El Paso. The death of the leader of a major drug cartel is a victory for the government, but it could also spur more violence, said Payan, an expert on drug trafficking in Mexico. For such a high-level blow by the military, reprisal killings by the cartel are a possibility, Payan said. Violence could also flare from within the Beltran Leyva organization itself, as its lieutenants jockey for position in the inevitable reorganization. Finally, rivals -- and maybe even allies -- of the cartel may fight for a piece of the organization's lucrative smuggling routes, Payan said. Beltran Leyva and his organization rose in the Pacific state of Sinaloa, home to a powerful cartel of the same name. Beltran Leyva and his brothers initially were allied with the Sinaloa cartel, headed by Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman. A series of disputes over the past years, however, led the Beltran Leyva brothers to turn on El Chapo, or ""shorty,"" and they have been most recently linked with Los Zetas, another violent cartel opposed to the Sinaloa group. One of the Beltran Leyva brothers, Alfredo, was arrested by Mexican authorities last year and remains imprisoned. Another brother, Hector, was indicted on drug trafficking charges out of New York and Washington. The slain brother, Arturo, was also named in those indictments. The Beltran Leyva cartel is known for air transportation expertise, Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman Michael Sanders said. An estimate from two years ago said the group smuggled 300 to 400 kilograms of cocaine monthly into the United States, Sanders said. The group is also known to smuggle black tar heroin. iReport: Ride-along with anti-drug task force . Earlier this month, the U.S. Treasury Department added Hector Beltran Leyva and other top cartel figures to a list of ""specially designated narcotics traffickers,"" a move that freezes any assets they have under U.S. jurisdiction and prohibits people in the United States from conducting business with them. Arturo Beltran Leyva was already identified as a kingpin in May 2008. In the most recent addition, the U.S. government named 22 members of the Beltran Leyva organization and 10 related companies. Since taking office, Calderon has made fighting the drug cartels a priority. More than 40,000 troops have been deployed throughout the country to help small and often corrupt local forces. But it was the navy that made one of the biggest busts in the war on drugs. The reason may be because after years in the field, the army was not as reliable as a fresh force. ""Calderon has finally understood two things: that the army is susceptible to corruption, and that the army is not sufficient,"" Payan said.","Arturo Beltran Leyva was one of Mexico's three most wanted criminals .

Of the 53 known infections with the virus, 30 have resulted in death since September 2012, the organization said. Precise data are not available on the total number of people who have been infected because it is difficult to tell how many get a mild form of the infection. A patient died May 28 in France after having contracted the virus during a trip to the Middle East. MERS: Your questions answered . The health agency said the three Italian patients were all in stable condition. The two cases reported Sunday were a 42-year-old woman and a 2-year-old girl who are close contacts of the man, the WHO said. The virus is ""a threat to the entire world,"" the WHO's general director said last week. 5 things to know about the coronavirus . It ""is not a problem that any single affected country can keep to itself or manage all by itself,"" Margaret Chan said Monday in her closing remarks at the 66th World Assembly in Geneva, Switzerland. Although many of the cases have occurred on the Arabian Peninsula, people have died of the infection elsewhere, including in four European countries and Tunisia. However, ""all of the European cases have had a direct or indirect connection to the Middle East,"" the WHO said earlier this month. But ""in France and the United Kingdom, there has been limited local transmission among close contacts who had not been to the Middle East but had been in contact with a traveler recently returned from the Middle East."" Coronaviruses cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, as well as a variety of animal diseases. Health officials do not yet know much about how the newly discovered virus spreads, which makes it hard for scientists to prevent infections, Chan said. The WHO is calling for the world to pull together its resources to study and tackle the virus. New virus is a 'threat to the entire world'","Of 53 known MERS-CoV infections worldwide, 30 have ended in death .

With exceptional talent deployed against the world's most important and intriguing topics, The Atlantic is the source of opinion, commentary, and analysis for America's most influential individuals who wish to be challenged, informed, and entertained."" --  The Atlantic 2013 media kit for advertisers . On Monday, The Atlantic published -- and then pulled -- a story titled ""David Miscavige Leads Scientology to Milestone Year."" This ""story"" went on to feature the growth of Scientology in 2012. Any regular reader of The Atlantic's content would immediately do a double-take upon seeing that kind of headline, much less the heavy-handed text below it, shamelessly plugging how well Scientology's ""ecclesiastical leader"" Miscavige has done in ""leading a renaissance for the religion."" This ""story"" is one of several ""advertorials"" (a portmanteau of ""advertising"" and ""editorials"") that The Atlantic has published online, clearly designated as ""Sponsor Content."" In other words, ""stories"" like these aren't real stories. They are ads with a lot of words, which advertisers have paid publications to run on their behalf for decades. You may have seen them in magazines and newspapers as ""special advertising sections."" The hope is that because you are already reading the publication, hey, maybe you'll read what the advertiser has to say, too -- instead of the ""traditional"" ad that they may have otherwise placed on the page that you probably won't remember, or worse, will ignore. There's nothing wrong with this tactic, ethically, when clearly labeled as ""sponsored"" or ""advertising."" But many took umbrage with The Atlantic in this particular case; so many, that The Atlantic responded by pulling the story from its site -- which was the right thing to do -- and by apologizing. At face value, The Atlantic did the right thing for its business model, which depends upon advertising sales. It sold what they call a ""native"" ad to a paying advertiser, clearly labeled it as such, without the intention of misleading readers into thinking this was a piece of journalism. But it still failed on several levels. The Atlantic defines its readers as ""America's most influential individuals who wish to be challenged, informed, and entertained."" By that very definition, it is selling ""advertorials"" to people who are the least likely to take them seriously, especially when heavy-handed. There is a fine line between advertorial and outright advertising copywriting, and this piece crossed it. The Church of Scientology is just as much at fault for thinking this piece would survive The Atlantic readers' intellectual scrutiny. But this isn't even the real issue. Bad advertising is all around us. And readers' intellectual scrutiny would surely have let the advertorial piece slide without complaints (though snark would be inevitable), as they have in the past, or yes, even possibly ignored it. But here's where The Atlantic crossed another line -- it seemed clear it was moderating the comments beneath the advertorial. As The Washington Post reported, The Atlantic marketing team was carefully pruning the comments, ensuring that they were predominantly positive, even though many readers were leaving negative comments. So while The Atlantic was publishing clearly labeled advertiser-written content, it was also un-publishing content created by its readers -- the very folks it exists to serve. It's understandable that The Atlantic would inevitably touch a third rail with any ""new"" ad format. But what it calls ""native advertising"" is actually ""advertorial."" It's not new at all. Touching the third rail in this case is unacceptable. So what should The Atlantic have done in this situation before it became a situation? For starters, it should have worked more closely with the Church of Scientology to help create a piece of content that wasn't so clearly written as an ad. If the Church of Scientology was not willing to compromise its advertising to be better content, then The Atlantic should not have accepted the advertising. But this is a quality-control issue. The real failure here was that comments should never have been enabled beneath this sponsored content unless the advertiser was prepared to let them be there, regardless of sentiment. It's not like Scientology has avoided controversy in the past. The sheer, obvious reason for this advertorial in the first place was to dispel beliefs that Scientology wasn't a recognized religion (hence ""ecclesiastical""). Whether The Atlantic felt it was acting in its advertiser's best interest, or the advertiser specifically asked for this to happen, letting it happen at all was a huge mistake, and a betrayal of an implicit contract that should exist between a publication of The Atlantic's stature and its readership. No matter how laughably ""sales-y"" a piece of sponsored content might be, the censoring of readership should be the true ""third rail,"" never to be touched. Going forward, The Atlantic (and any other publication that chooses to run sponsored content) should adopt and clearly communicate an explicit ethics statement regarding advertorials and their corresponding comments. This statement should guide the decisions it makes when working with advertisers, and serve as a filter for the sponsored content it chooses to publish, and what it recommends advertisers submit. It should also prevent readers from being silenced if given a platform at all. As an advertising professional, I sincerely hope this doesn't spook The Atlantic or any other publication from experimenting with ways to make money. But as a reader, I hope it leads to better ads that reward me for paying attention, rather than muzzle my voice should I choose to interact with the content. After all, what more could a publication or advertiser ask for than for content to be so interesting that someone actually would want to comment on (or better, share) it? (Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly said native advertising accounts for 59% of the Atlantic's ad revenue. Digital advertising, of which native advertising is a part, accounts for 59% of The Atlantic's overall revenue, according to the company.)","The Atlantic published and pulled a sponsored Scientology ""story""

"His eyes moist and lower lip trembling, Clint Romesha nodded haltingly at family, comrades, military brass and the president standing to applaud him for receiving the nation's highest military decoration, the Medal of Honor. He never smiled during the White House ceremony on Monday and later explained why in a statement to reporters. ""I stand here with mixed emotions of both joy and sadness today,"" he said, describing how he felt ""conflicted"" about the medal around his neck. ""The joy comes from recognition from us doing our jobs as soldiers on distant battlefields,"" said Romesha, a former Army staff sergeant dressed in full uniform that included a cavalry hat. ""But it is countered by the constant reminder of the loss of our battle buddies - my battle buddies, my soldiers, my friends."" An American hero: The uncommon valor of Clint Romesha . For ""conspicuous gallantry ... at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty,"" Romesha, 31, received the honor at an emotional ceremony lightened by his rambunctious toddler son. In conferring the medal, President Barack Obama described the conditions faced by Romesha and 52 other soldiers when they came under attack from mortar, rocket-propelled grenade, machine-gun and sniper fire on October 3, 2009, at Combat Outpost Keating in the mountains of eastern Afghanistan. A military investigation later described the outpost as indefensible against the higher-ground positions surrounding it, and Obama noted the challenge that Romesha's unit faced from the estimated 300 Taliban insurgents. Explosions from the dawn attack ""shook them out of theirs beds and sent them rushing for their weapons, and soon the awful odds became clear,"" Obama said. ""What happened next has been described as one of the most intense battles of the entire war in Afghanistan,"" the president continued. ""The attackers had the advantage, the high ground, the mountains above, and they were unleashing everything they had -- rocket-propelled grenades, heavy machine guns, mortars, snipers taking aim."" Romesha and his men ""had never seen anything like it,"" Obama said. Clint Romesha, the bravest of the brave . ""With gunfire impacting all around him, Clint raced to one of the barracks and grabbed a machine gun,"" the president said. ""He took aim at one of the enemy machine teams and took it out. A rocket-propelled grenade exploded, sending shrapnel into his hip, his arm and his neck, but he kept fighting, disregarding his own wounds and tended to an injured comrade instead."" Later in the battle, Romesha and his team charged more than 100 yards through enemy fire to reach wounded soldiers in the outpost, Obama added. The audience on Monday included relatives of the eight soldiers killed in the battle, and Obama paid tribute to the efforts by Romesha and his fellow soldiers to bring them back. ""Our troops should never ever be put in a position where they have to defend the indefensible,"" Obama said. ""That's what these soldiers did for each other in sacrifice driven by pure love, and because they did, eight grieving families were at least able to welcome their soldiers home one last time."" Before the East Room ceremony, the militaristic and somber atmosphere was lightened by Romesha's son, Colin, who climbed the podium and examined the lectern, briefly playing hide-and-seek with the bemused onlookers. It took a military escort to entice Colin to his mother's arms in the first row, and when Obama spoke a few minutes later, he prompted chuckles in pointing out the boy's exuberant nature. ""Colin is not as shy as Clint,"" Obama said. ""He was in the Oval Office and he was racing around pretty good and sampled a number of apples before he found the one that was just right."" Romesha was invited to be the guest of first lady Michelle Obama Tuesday at the president's State of the Union address. But he declined the invitation, telling CNN that he has decided to spend the evening with friends from his former unit, Black Knight Troop, 3-61 CAV, his wife Tammy -- with whom he celebrates a wedding anniversary Tuesday -- and their families. Romesha to be guest of first lady at State of the Union . Romesha is the fourth living person to receive the nation's highest military decoration for actions in Afghanistan or Iraq. The battle at Combat Outpost Keating raged for more than 12 hours. When it ended, with Romesha and others having held onto the outpost, more than half of their 53-soldier contingent had been killed or wounded. Despite his own wounds, Romesha led a charge across the outpost that regained control of the ammunition supply depot. In doing so, he ignored an order to hold his position, pretending the radio was broken. The U.S. military closed the heavily damaged outpost three days later, destroying what remained to prevent it from aiding insurgents in any way. A few months later, a U.S. military investigation found that measures taken to protect the outpost were lax, and critical intelligence and reconnaissance assistance had been diverted from the base.

"In places such as Murrieta, California, and Oracle, Arizona, the message is clear: Thousands of immigrant children fleeing Central America are unwelcome in Small Town U.S.A. The children, many of them arriving unaccompanied from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, have traveled up to 3,000 miles across deserts and rivers, clinging to the tops of trains. They sometimes face rape and beatings at the hands of ""coyotes,"" smugglers who are paid thousands of dollars to sneak them across the southern border with Mexico. Earlier this month in Murrieta, busloads of babies in their mothers' laps, teens, 'tweens and toddlers were turned back from a detainee facility. They were met by screaming protesters waving and wearing American flags and bearing signs that read such things as ""Return to Sender."" And so it goes. Southwest border towns, West Coast suburbs, and middle-America enclaves have become the newest battleground in the vitriolic political debate over immigration. The showdowns highlight the scope and depth of challenges the Obama administration grapples with as officials try to use immigration-related fixes to resolve what politicians on both sides of the aisle have called ""a humanitarian crisis."" Here's a snapshot of how things are playing out across the country: . Arizona: In Oracle, a town of roughly 3,700, protesters faced off Tuesday at Sycamore Canyon Academy, a nearby boys ranch that is to be used as a temporary housing facility for the immigrant minors, according to CNN affiliate KOLD. Protesters representing both sides of the debate screamed and waved signs reading such things as ""Send 'em to Coyote Obama,"" according to video from CNN affiliate KPNX. One man trumpeted a Mariachi-version of the ""Star-Spangled Banner"" as people around him yelled. Protesters even tried to stop a bus of kids from the local YMCA , which they had mistaken as the immigrant children. But the Central American children never arrived, according to media reports. Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu said accepting the unaccompanied juvenile immigrants only encourages more to come. ""Their very hope was realized when we took them in. Nobody was turned back and what I believe, and I think a lot of Americans would agree, is instead of accepting these 90,000, they should have -- the humanitarian way to address this is reunite them with their families and their country of origin because this 90,000 is going to be hundreds of thousands,"" he told CNN's Chris Cuomo Wednesday. ""These children should be returned to their home country -- not to Oracle, Arizona, paid for by American taxpayers,"" Babeu said earlier in a statement on the department's Facebook page. California: In sharp contrast to the reception similar children received in Murrieta, Central American immigrant children have been welcomed by the community of Fontana. Just over 40 immigrants on Homeland Security buses arrived at the St. Joseph's Catholic Church there on Thursday and were greeted by staff and community donations of food, clothing and toys, according to CNN affiliate KTLA. And a group of California state lawmakers headed to Central America on Monday to discuss the surge of immigrant children with leaders from that region, according to CNN affiliate KCRA. Texas: Protestors in Waco, Texas, meanwhile, are demanding better conditions for the 250 men from El Salvador being held at the Jack Harwell Detention Center, according to CNN affiliate KCEN. And the League City, Texas, City Council approved a proposal banning the housing or detention of undocumented immigrants within the city at a recent meeting, according to KHOU. New Mexico: In Artesia, New Mexico, hundreds of residents turned out for a contentious town hall meeting to decry the hundreds of women and children being housed at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, a facility that also trains Border Patrol agents, according to CNN affiliate KOAT. Iowa: Gov. Terry Branstad told CNN affiliate WHO on Monday that he does not want federal officials to send Central American children to his state, adding that by accepting them, the United States is sending ""a signal to send kids illegally."" Some local aid groups are appalled. ""My God. This is a humanitarian crisis,"" said Kathleen McQuillen, the Iowa Program Director of American Friends Service Committee. McQuillen's group, a Quaker-based organization, questions how the country could spend trillions on war and not have the pennies on those dollars to spend to take care of children in dire need. She said, ""It's a simple thing to begin to say, what's important in this world?"" Nebraska: At a National Governors Association meeting in Nashville earlier this month, Nebraska Gov. Dave Heineman complained that federal officials did not notify him that they were placing hundreds of immigrant children with family members in his state. Michigan: Protesters headed to city hall in Vassar earlier this month to oppose a social service agency's plan to temporarily house 60 immigrant children according to CNN affiliate WNEM. ""It's about the American government, Democrat or Republican, getting off their lazy butts and passing a decent bill where we can screen our immigrants, make sure they're not felons, diseased or whatever, and get a program set up to bring them into this country,"" Vassar resident Jack Smith told WNEM. Virginia: Federal officials shelved plans to send the children to an unoccupied, historically black college campus in Lawrenceville, a small community of about 1,400, after nearly the entire town showed up at a meeting and furiously denounced the proposal. ""Our staff will immediately cease any further activities in your community,"" Mark Greenberg,  the Department of Health and Human Services acting assistant secretary for children and families, wrote the community in June. Prince William County officials were frustrated to learn second-hand that some children are being housed in shelters in the region. ""HHS did not inform the county. We're somewhat upset about that,"" Prince William County Board of Supervisors Chairman Corey Stewart told CNN affiliate WJLA. ""I'm concerned these children may be housed here permanently and of course there is going to be a drain on our educational system and other county services."" Maryland: Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley told CNN in an interview that he asked the White House to not send the minor immigrants to a site in western Maryland that was under consideration. ""What I said was that would not be the most inviting site in Maryland. There are already hundreds of kids already located throughout Maryland,"" O'Malley said. The plan was scuttled. O'Malley officials pointed to graffiti that was found spray painted on the shelter site in Westminster, Maryland, last weekend as an indication of hostility the migrant housing plan was generating. ""No illeagles here. No undocumented Democrats,"" the graffiti read. A Maryland law enforcement official told the Washington Post the message would be investigated as a hate crime. Washington: Roughly 600 unaccompanied immigrant children from Central America may soon be heading to Joint Base Lewis-McChord south of Tacoma, according to CNN affiliate KING. Representatives with HHS are slated to meet Wednesday with Lakewood city leaders and staffers from the office of Democratic Rep. Denny Heck to discuss the matter. ""The biggest concern we have here in DuPont is the security,"" DuPont City Administrator Ted Danek told the station. ""You've got a lot of people coming here (with) no known backgrounds."" And on Monday, the U.S. government deported the first group of what authorities promise will be many more -- about 40 mothers and children. They flew to Honduras on a charter flight. Despite the perils of their journey to the United States and their failed attempt to stay, one woman plans to make the trek again. There is nothing left for them at home, she said.","A number of U.S. towns have protested the arrival of unaccompanied immigrant kids .
The harshest clashes have been in border states and communities in Western states .

"Three days after a massive earthquake threw Haiti into chaos, Alvana was homeless, along with her two children. But her nightmare was just beginning. ""I was gang-raped while I was sleeping in the middle of the street,"" she said. ""And I got pregnant."" Alvana did not know her attackers. Depressed and unsure of what to do next, she was directed by a friend to a clinic run by KOFAVIV, a Creole acronym that translates into the Commission of Women Victims for Victims. ""By the time I got to them, my belly was already big,"" she said. ""But they took care of me."" Alvana was given food, water, housing and prenatal care. She decided to keep her daughter, even though the psychological pain could be difficult -- and still is, two years later. ""It's terrible,"" said Alvana, 33. ""I love my daughter ... (but) I look at myself and see that I have a child that is a product of a gang rape."" Her story is, unfortunately, all too common in Haiti, said Malya Villard-Appolon, one of KOFAVIV's co-founders. ""After (the earthquake), the situation was inhumane and degrading,"" Villard-Appolon said. ""There was no security in the (displacement) camps. There was no food; there was no work. And now there is a rampant problem."" Accurate numbers are difficult, if not impossible, to find in the aftermath of such devastation, but KOFAVIV and other groups say they have seen a definite increase in rape cases after the January 2010 earthquake. ""Victims became more vulnerable due to a range of things,"" said Brian Concannon Jr., director of the Institute for Justice & Democracy in Haiti. ""They lost their houses; there were no locked doors anymore. People lost family members who were a source of protection."" Terrible living conditions, including a shortage of food and water, contribute to the problem as well, said Charity Tooze, a senior communications officer with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees' Washington office. ""The conditions are so dehumanizing,"" Tooze said. ""Over months and months, it increases all forms of violence, including sexual violence."" There has also been a lack of prosecution in the country. In the first two years after the quake, not one person in Haiti has been convicted of rape, according to the UNHCR. ""The big problem is, you can't find justice,"" said Villard-Appolon, 52. Even before the quake, she says, rape was an issue in Haiti, historically underreported because of social stigma, retaliation from perpetrators and a lack of legal support. That is what led her and Marie Eramithe Delva to start KOFAVIV in 2004. Since the group's inception, it has helped more than 4,000 rape survivors find safety, psychological support and/or legal aid. ""We tell people to come out of silence,"" she said. ""Do not be afraid to say that you have been victimized."" Villard-Appolon knows what it's like to be a victim of sexual violence. She has been raped twice, and her husband died as a result of beatings he endured trying to save her from being raped. In 2010, her 14-year-old daughter was raped in a displacement camp. ""I can't describe to you how I felt when I heard about that, because I was a victim,"" she said. ""I started asking myself what kind of generation I came from. Am I cursed?"" Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2013 CNN Heroes . She escorted her daughter to two police stations and received no assistance, she said, just a lot of talk. One police officer told her that ""girls are so promiscuous"" and indicated that many young girls are asking for sex. But she carries on, ""fighting with hope that I know there will be a change,"" she said. Internationally, she has testified before the United Nations Human Rights Council, calling for increased security within the displacement camps and asking that women's groups be included in decision-making processes. ""I was a victim, and I did not find justice. But know I will get it for other women,"" she told CNN. When the earthquake hit Haiti, KOFAVIV's founders watched their clinic and their offices collapse along with their homes. Villard-Appolon lived in the dangerous Champ de Mars displacement camp for half a year. There, she said, she watched as conditions deteriorated. ""It was all kinds of people who ended up in one area,"" she said. ""The jails were not destroyed, but their doors were opened, and all prisoners went free. Many of them ... were armed, and they were notorious murderers."" One criminal held Villard-Appolon at gunpoint, demanding money. The police never showed up, she said, but she managed to escape after a group of supporters arrived to fight. Villard-Appolon said many single women had to leave their children with strangers in order to search for food, water or work. In some cases, the children were raped. The youngest victim, she says, was a 17-month-old. ""I spent six months witnessing it,"" she said. ""Babies are not spared; adults are not spared; mothers are not spared; sisters are not spared."" Despite the escalating violence and the loss of its clinic, KOFAVIV regrouped to help victims in Haiti's ""tent city"" camps, where about 500,000 people still live today. The group has 66 female outreach agents and 25 male security guards who work within the camps, organizing nighttime community watch groups and providing whistles and flashlights to women. All of them have been affected by gender-based violence, whether personally or through a family member or loved one, Villard-Appolon said. KOFAVIV also relies on more than 1,000 members to help share their stories, support the victims and urge them to come forward and fight for justice. It usually starts by accompanying the victims to the hospital within 72 hours of being raped. Once they undergo a test, they receive the medical certificate they must have to begin legal proceedings. ""After that, we assign a lawyer to her,"" Villard-Appolon said. There is no cost to the victims, and they receive support from KOFAVIV through the trial. Villard-Appolon says she is determined to keep fighting for a brighter future, even though justice has been elusive. ""My dream is that we will get to a place where we stop talking about the number of rape cases,"" she said. ""We will stop talking about Haiti as a country where people are committing violence against others. One day, we have to be able to say that we have a country with people who respect each other.""

"Motilal Kushwaha had promised the Hindu goddess Gadhimai that he would offer her a male goat if one of his children found a job. Last year his son was successful -- and on Saturday he was one of tens of thousands of people killing the animals at the temple of Gadhimai in southern Nepal as part of the biggest religious mass slaughter in the world. ""From my village everyone has made a vow [to offer animals],"" says Kushwaha from Bariyarpur, a community in Bara district about 60 miles south of Kathmandu. Some, he explains, are glad they have got a son or a daughter, others that a different form of good fortune has befallen them. The ritual sacrifice of goats, buffaloes and roosters in temples and at home is widespread in Nepal where 80 percent of the population are Hindu. Some five million people from adjoining districts -- and also from the bordering Indian states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh -- will attend the festival, according to local authorities, although only two days are dedicated to the sacrificial ritual itself. The slaughter follows a set pattern: on Friday male water buffalo calves are killed while on Saturday attentions switches to goats. Officials estimate that up to 10,000 buffalo calves and 150,000 goats will be offered to Gadhimai -- the goddess of power -- during the ritual.  Watch a CNNi report on the ritual . But these numbers will be much lower than those of 2009, the last time the five-yearly Gadhimai festival took place, thanks to advocacy efforts by animal rights activists. In that year nearly 20,000 buffalo calves were killed, according to temple officials and more than 200,000 goats were slaughtered. ""We object to the cruelty with which animals are treated,"" says Pramada Shah of Animal Welfare Network Nepal. ""There is random hacking of animals in open space. Not all animals have their heads chopped off. Some take up to 40 minutes to die."" The participants --  who hack the animals in an enclosed arena with large knives -- are licensed by the Gadhimai Festival Management and Development Committee. This year about 400 people will kill animals, according to Kushwaha, who is also the committee's secretary. The animals not only suffer while they are being killed: they are also transported over long distances on foot. ""By the time they get to the festival venue they are half dead,"" says Shah. ""They are kept two or three days without food after they are brought here."" Activists have gone to the courts in Nepal and India to halt the sacrifices. Last month Nepal's Supreme Court did not stop the animal sacrifices but ruled that existing laws have to be followed. ""If the existing laws are implemented there would be no ritual sacrifices,"" says Shambhu Thapa, the lawyer who filed the case, explaining that only animals killed in a slaughterhouse are fit to be eaten. (The meat of the sacrificed animal is usually eaten, or given away to meat-eaters for their consumption.) Courts in India also directed the Indian government not to control the unnecessary export of animals to Nepal. The Indian authorities, for their part, had directed security agencies and state governments to check the flow of livestock to the neighboring country. In a letter to the Uttar Pradesh government seen by CNN, India's Home Ministry estimated in September as many as 90,000 buffaloes would be ""illegally"" transported to Nepal for the festival. But animals continue to flow into Nepal through the porous and open border. ""The border cannot be controlled and corruption is endemic,"" says Shah. Nepalese authorities are also reluctant to stop the ritual sacrifice. ""We cannot do this,"" explains chief district officer Dulal. ""We cannot speak against it. This is something to do with culture."" Kushwaha adds: ""If we tell the people to stop the sacrifices, they will come to kill us. This is something related to people's religion and faith."" Hindu religion does not support the ritual sacrifice of animals, says Shah. ""We consulted religious priests on the matter,"" she says. Activists in Gadhimai, meanwhile, are confident that there will be changes in people's attitudes. Uttimlal Chaurasiya, from Bariyarpur, claims that some 40 percent of the women in the village have said that they will not sacrifice animals. Three years ago he started a campaign showing videos of cruelty to animals at the festival to villagers. While awareness is being raised at a local level, he believes binding laws are still needed to stop the sacrifices. ""All living creatures are equal in the eyes of god,"" he says. ""Instead of animals we can offer gourds, pumpkins, coconuts and sweets to the goddess."" The festival management committee cannot stop the animal sacrifices, but if the government asks the committee can discuss the issue, says Kushwaha. Shah and other activists had been working with the government since the last festival in 2009 to stop the sacrifices but although there was some progress, a government decision was not reached. Meanwhile, on Friday morning tens of thousands of people gathered around the temple in Bara district, southern Nepal, waiting for the sacrificial ritual to begin. ""People seem to be in a merry mood and look like they have been waiting for this moment for ages,"" says Niraj Gautam, an animal welfare activist, from Bariyarpur. ""But it is a sad day for us."" He estimates 6,000 to 8,000 water buffaloes will be randomly hacked, not necessarily by having their heads chopped off. ""Any part of the body can be cut,"" he says. ""Last time round we saw buffalo walking with their head hanging.""","Thousands of water buffalo and goats will be slaughtered in Nepal's Gadhimai festival .
Held every five years, the festival is dedicated to a Hindu goddess of power .

"Tianna Gaines-Turner is so politically active, she gave 2012 presidential candidate Mitt Romney a questionnaire to answer on policy positions. When he failed to respond, she volunteered on President Barack Obama's campaign. She also encourages her neighbors to vote. Her activism is persistent despite feeling like she is an ignored component of the American electorate. ""I feel like they're not talking to me,"" Gaines-Turner said of politicians. That's because she is poor. Her life is not unlike those of millions of Americans who rely on a patchwork of government assistance and near-minimum wage jobs. The mother of a 9-year-old and 6-year-old twins, who was once homeless, finds herself unemployed again because her temporary job at a day care ended on December 2. Her husband makes $8.50 per hour working behind the food counter at a deli; they struggle to feed their family even with $160 per month in food stamp benefits. Opinion: Out of jobs, out of benefits, out of luck . Even though she feels disconnected from the political process, Gaines-Turner is politically motivated. If politicians understood what life is like for her and her neighbors, she said, things could get better. ""It's hurtful because they don't know what we go through every month,"" she said of politicians. Nearly 50 million live in poverty in the United States -- about one out of every six people -- matching or beating some of the highest poverty rates since the 1960s. But it is one of the least discussed topics in national politics. Correspondent's notebook: Hungry during the holidays . An Obama pledge . Well into his second term, President Barack Obama has turned his attention to poverty and income inequality. It's an issue he's rarely addressed up to this point. In key unemployment benefits vote, Democrats one vote short . In his first presidential campaign, poverty was not a focus, but Obama pledged to end childhood hunger by 2015. He's far from achieving that. The year Obama made the pledge, a record 31.8 million people received supplemental food benefits. That record has been broken each year since, with more than 47 million people now in the food stamp program. While he has launched a campaign to address income inequality by urging Congress to raise the federal minimum wage and extend expired unemployment benefits, activists said Obama has done little that is substantive. But the issue was around long before Obama took office in 2008. Fifty years after President Lyndon Johnson launched the War on Poverty, which was a central component of his 1964 campaign, poverty still affects millions of Americans. And the gap between the wealthy and the poor has grown steadily. The top 5% of households possessed 22.3% of income in 2012, compared with 16.3% in 1968, according to the Census Bureau. Moreover, a 2011 report by the Congressional Budget Office found that the top 1% of households have seen after-tax income grow by 275% since 1979, compared with 18% for the bottom 20%. Those at the low end did not keep up with inflation. The nonpartisan congressional analysts blamed unequal wage distribution and ""less redistributive"" government benefits and taxes for increased income inequality. Obama: Wage, income gap eroding American dream . Just as problematic to hunger and poverty activists  -- and to people like Gaines-Turner -- there is almost no real discussion of issues important to them in Washington, except when they surface in periodic budget wrangling. Dr. Mariana Chilton, an associate professor at Drexel University's School of Public Health and founder of the Witnesses to Hunger project focusing on ""mothers who know poverty first hand,"" said the lack of discussion is detrimental to the poor because winning candidates can't be held accountable for promises they never make. ""We've seen a complete falling away of people in positions of leadership,"" she said. But that could change: Dealing with poverty appears to be trending like Miley Cyrus. Progressive candidates . Liberals hope 2016 will be different as they push people like Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren to run for president. A neophyte politician, Warren is a champion of liberal economic policies. And progressives believe the election of Democrat Bill de Blasio as mayor of New York, the world's financial capital, is a promising sign the nation may be more ready to discuss issues pertaining to poor people. A populist, de Blasio has stressed a tale of ""two cities"" theme that illustrated a division of rich and poor. De Blasio sworn in by Bill Clinton . ""The increasing interest on giving everyone in society a fair shake ... could foreshadow the fact that we may be on the cusp of entering a new progressive era,"" said Chris Lehane, a Democratic strategist who worked for former President Bill Clinton and presidential candidate Al Gore. Conservatives, too . But the push on poverty and income inequality might come from an unexpected corner of American politics: the conservative wing of the Republican Party. Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, a possible 2016 contender, is to address poverty Thursday at an event with NBC News' Brian Williams, which could be the advent of a public campaign on the issue. For the past year, he has quietly been exploring the theme. He embarked on a listening and learning tour of poor communities across the United States, according to several people who have either accompanied him or discussed it with him. Arthur Books, president of the American Enterprise Institute conservative think tank, said Ryan ""represents a movement and a recognition that in the past five years, people in the bottom half have gone backwards."" Brooks said he has spoken with Ryan, the 2012 Republican vice presidential nominee, about poverty and the issue is something that he wants to tackle. It started less than a month before Romney and Ryan lost the election. While the standard bearer was largely seen as an aloof elitist, Ryan met with a group of low-income people at Cleveland State University. Bob Woodson, an acquaintance of Ryan who runs the Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, a national organization that works with low-income people, said the lawmaker reached out to him after the election, saying he wanted to learn more. Ryan meets with him one day a month in a different city and spends time with poor people, Woodson said. ""It's been an eye-opener"" for Ryan, Woodson said. ""I've taken him to places that few other representatives have been."" Woodson thinks Ryan will eventually form a poverty agenda, ""but before he does so, he needs to understand what the needs are."" While Ryan is exploring the issue quietly, two other potential 2016 candidates are also highlighting the issue. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky delivered a speech on poverty in Detroit in recent weeks. Evidence that he might be looking to elevate the issue politically is that he chose the Motor City, which is bankrupt despite a resurgence in auto manufacturing. Michigan is also a traditional presidential battleground. Rand Paul: Extending jobless benefits a 'disservice' And Florida Sen. Marco Rubio is unveiling his anti-poverty agenda this week. The right's focus on the poor is a strict about-face. The Republican Party is considered unsympathetic to the poor. Current efforts in Congress to sharply cut food stamps and statewide efforts to drug-test welfare recipients exacerbate the perception. If politicians make poverty a central -- or at least one -- component of national campaigns, it would be a significant departure from modern-day politicking. Recent politics . Medicare and Social Security often receive widespread attention on the campaign trail because the issues have political advantages. While both are credited for lifting and keeping seniors out of poverty, the programs are available to all seniors. Politicians covet senior voters. Welfare, unemployment benefits and food stamps -- government programs intended to benefit those most in need -- are spread throughout the population and traditionally don't get as much political exposure. While an expansion of government programs could be risky rhetoric in some political circles -- especially Republican ones -- innovative approaches to address the often-talked about gap between rich and poor and the shrinking middle class have been absent. The only major party candidate recently to make poverty a central theme was Democrat John Edwards, who did so at a time when the economy was perceived to be strong. The former senator fell short in the 2008 presidential primaries against Obama, who spoke in generic broad sweeps about a more just and prosperous citizenship that could simultaneously be appealing to the wealthiest and poorest. Instead, poverty becomes an issue only when a candidate's dismissal of the poor becomes public. Sutter: The most unequal place in America . Romney's campaign faced a backlash when he said he was ""not concerned"" about the very poor. His comment that 47% of Americans were ""dependent upon the government"" also became a political liability. But is political ignorance of poverty calculated? The middle class supplies the greatest percentage of votes. And if people truly vote their interest, the middle class wants to hear how it would benefit. One voter who was squarely in the middle class said during Edwards' campaign that she couldn't relate to what he was talking about. Lehane, the Democratic strategist, said the poor don't vote, ""which means their voices are not as loud in the political process as they should be -- especially given the number of children near, at or below the poverty line."" Statistics do show that lower-income people are less likely to vote. According to CNN exit polls, those who made less than $15,000 per year made up 6% of voters in 2008. More than 13% of the overall population fell below the poverty line that year. Fueled by a troubled economy, perhaps, politicians are looking to turn that philosophy on its head. Philosophical divide . Deep philosophical divides on the best way to address the issue are likely, even if Republicans take it on. Democrats tend to support policies that involve more government and equitable wealth distribution, while Republicans tend to back a ""trickle-down"" approach  in which stronger upper- and middle-class economies benefit the poor. Acknowledging the issue is the first step, said Woodson, who runs the Center for Neighborhood Enterprise. ""That's the kind of dialogue that I'm trying to get going,"" he said. ""I'm trying to get both conservatives and liberals to debate which interventions improve the lives of poor people.""

"It sounds like standard radio chatter between an airplane and ground control, mostly repeating the identifying number of the flight. But the recording that Malaysian officials played for the first time in public in a Beijing conference room on Tuesday is purportedly the last known words of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 before it disappeared on March 8. ""Malaysia three-seven-zero contact Ho Chi Minh 120.9, good night,"" says a voice identified by Malaysian officials as that of a radar controller in Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital. ""Good night Malaysian three-seven-zero,"" answers a male voice believed to be a crew member on the plane. Malaysian officials released the audio recording more than 50 days after the plane disappeared, in a long-awaited briefing before scores of relatives of the flight's Chinese passengers. The session on Tuesday also included the release of a chronology of the aircraft's last known contacts with radar stations as well as a satellite orbiting over the Indian Ocean. At 2:03 a.m. local time on March 8, the operational dispatch center of Malaysia Airlines sent a message to the cockpit instructing the pilot to contact ground control in Vietnam, said Sayid Ruzaimi Syed Aris, an official with Malaysia's aviation authority. Sayid said flight MH370 did not respond to the message. Fuel calculations . Nearly 20 minutes later, at 2:22, the Royal Malaysian Air Force picked up the flight for the last time on its radar system, Sayid said. By that point, Sayid said, the plane was believed to have swerved far off course over the Malaysian coastal area of Penang, in the direction of the Malacca Strait. According to Malaysian officials in Beijing on Tuesday, there was no direct communication between Malaysia Airlines and MH370 for a five-hour period, until the airline tried unsuccessfully to call the cockpit. ""At 7:13,"" Sayid said, Malaysia Airlines tried to ""make a voice call to the aircraft, but no pickup."" If all had gone according to plan, MH370 would have landed at the international airport in Beijing at 6:30 a.m. on March 8. Malaysian officials told Chinese families on Tuesday that, by their calculations, the aircraft would have run out of fuel seven hours and 31 minutes into the flight. ""Based on the fuel calculation ... the aircraft fuel starvation will occur at time 08:12,"" said Subas Chandran, a Malaysia Airlines representative. The Malaysian delegation also published slides showing the last known ""handshakes"" between the aircraft and an Inmarsat satellite over the Indian Ocean. The sixth and final handshake took place at 8:11 a.m. Malaysian time. According to these Inmarsat data points, in relation to the Inmarsat satellite, Flight 370 was far south of where it should have been if it had been on its planned route to Beijing. MH370: New phase to include private contractors, may cost $60 million . 'Making progress' The latest briefing marked a sharp change from previous combative meetings between Chinese family members and Malaysian officials. The ""families' committee"" that has formed during the agonizing month and a half since the plane's disappearance has spent weeks demanding details on the aircraft's last known location. Last week, more than 100 family members marched at midnight to the Malaysian Embassy in Beijing and staged a 15-hour sit-in demanding a meeting with a high-level technical delegation. ""They are making progress,"" said Jimmy Wang, a member of the families' technical committee, after Tuesday morning's briefing. CNN TV exclusive: Malaysian PM not declaring passengers dead .

"There once was a time, many years ago, when the sounds of bagpipes struck fear into the stomachs of Englishmen. But today mine was responding differently. Because, come sunset, I will have tasted the world's best bowl of porridge. The Scottish village of Carrbridge is known as the gateway to the Cairngorm mountains -- and for one weekend last month it was also the epicentre of the porridge world. Challengers from around the globe traveled here to win the Golden Spurtle, the prize coveted by every competitor in the World Porridge Championship. To start the ceremonies, kilted pipers led the cooks from the bridge along the main street, and to the village hall. At the head of the parade were the judges, holding aloft the prize, glittering in the morning sunshine. Master of ceremonies Martyn O'Reilly raised a glass of whiskey in solemn tribute to the mighty meal: ""Ladies and gentlemen we drink a toast to the porridge,"" he said. ""To the porridge!"" the cooks roared in reply, downing their tots in one. Their enthusiasm is being echoed in diners across Britain. Porridge is becoming big business, worth $400 million in the UK alone. Fast food stores in London such as McDonald's, Starbucks and Pret a Manger sell thousands of instant porridge pots every week. MORE MARKETPLACE EUROPE: Skyscanner brings Silicon Valley to Scotland . In Carrbridge, the village hall was decorated with the flags of many nations, from the U.S. to Scandinavia -- and even from across the border in England. The Golden Spurtle rewards the maker of the best traditional porridge -- a seemingly simple blend of three ingredients: oatmeal, water and salt. However I was assured even the most experienced chefs find it almost impossible to produce the same porridge twice in a row. Neal Robertson was World Porridge Champion in 2010. I know this because he bears a tattoo on his right arm declaring the fact. He has studied spurtle technique closely and invented a double-backed spoon which he calls a ""Spon,"" which he believes gives him an advantage over those to whom he hasn't managed to sell one. ""You should always stir with your right hand, always stir while standing up and you should always stir clockwise because it keeps the devil at bay,"" he told me. MORE MARKETPLACE EUROPE: Germany's cheap, clean energy . With a thirty-minute time limit per heat, tension mounted as the clock ticked down. Each competitor poured out the required three bowls of their best brew. The steaming porridge was then collected on trays and carried through to the judges' room. The table strained under the weight of the bowls. Each was secretly numbered to protect the anonymity of the competitors. The terminology used was clearly technical to my untrained ears. ""That's foisty""...""claggy""...""snottery""...that's a curling puck,"" one said. ""I like that, it's quite nutty..."" ""That one's too thick...it's bland...it's gloopy."" More and more bowls arrived. One trio turned up with firework sparklers showering the table. Another declared itself as ""Podgeree"" a mix of porridge and kedgeree - the curry-flavoured smoked fish, egg and rice dish beloved by officers of the British Raj. MORE MARKETPLACE EUROPE: Spain turns clock back on siestas . ""Och it's too hot!"" exclaimed one judge. ""It's an abomination, it's disgusting."" You could hear a spurtle drop as the judge prepared to reveal the identity of this year's champion. It was Gaelic singer John Boa, the gentle giant who won in 2011 but lost the Spurtle to an Englishman last year. There were tears in his eyes as he accepted the award to cheers and applause echoing around the rafters of the village hall. ""It's a fun event and we shouldn't get too emotional but it's got a pull this thing and my only regret is that last year's champion wasn't here to be put in his place but there it is,"" he said. ""We don't mind people coming here to win the spurtle but they should bow to the master when he's been anointed."" Next year the competition will take place within two weeks of Scotland's referendum on whether to become independent of the U.K. If John Boa were to repeat his success in the Golden Spurtle, he could become the first world champion of an independent Scotland. Now there's a stirring thought.","The Scottish village of Carrbridge is host to the World Porridge Championship .

"A number of the world's leading airlines on Tuesday suspended flights to Israel's main airport after a rocket fired from Gaza struck about a mile from its runways. The Federal Aviation Administration ordered U.S. airlines to stop flying to or from Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion International Airport for at least 24 hours, and the European Aviation Safety Agency issued a warning to its airlines to stop its flights. The action came just days after Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot out of the sky over eastern Ukraine, where government troops have been battling Russian-backed separatists. The flight suspensions to Israel were the latest development in the 15-day-old conflict between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza, with neither side showing any sign of backing down. At least 41 rockets were fired from Gaza toward Israel on Tuesday, according to the Israel Defense Forces. The FAA ordered Delta Air Lines, US Airways and United Airlines to suspend their flights to Tel Aviv. ""The notice was issued in response to a rocket strike which landed approximately one mile"" from the airport Tuesday morning, the FAA said. ""...The FAA will continue to monitor and evaluate the situation. Updated instructions will be provided to U.S. airlines as soon as conditions permit, but no later than  24 hours"" from when the suspension was ordered. A number of European airlines as well as Turkish Airlines suspended flights after an advisory issued by the European Aviation Safety Agency. EASA ""strongly recommends airspace users to refrain from operating to and from Tel Aviv Ben Gurion International Airport,"" according to the advisory. As of Tuesday evening, the Israel Airport Authority was showing a number of flight cancellations, but British Airways and a handful of smaller airlines still appeared to be operating flights. Operations at the airport in Tel Aviv continued Tuesday after the FAA issued its order, according to CNN's Atika Shubert, who was reporting from Ben Gurion Airport. Shubert said she saw a rocket being intercepted near the airport. ""This is the environment that the planes are flying in and out of,"" she said. The Israel Airport Authority said the U.S. companies made the decisions on their own, and it urged them to reconsider, saying the airport was safe. ""There is no reason that American carriers should stop flying to Israel and thus give a prize to terror,"" it said. But aviation security consultant Jeff Price called the decision by airlines to halt flights to Tel Aviv's airport for the moment ""a prudent measure"" that was likely influenced by the shooting down of the Malaysia Airlines jetliner over Ukraine. ""The airline must protect their passengers and their asset (the airplane) from death, damage and destruction, so they aren't going to fly into a location that they believe to be unsafe,"" Price said. ""This is the same situation that airlines encounter during natural disasters like hurricanes, where the airlines move their aircraft out of harm's way until the storm has passed. This is a storm of a different kind, and I think because of MH17 people are more sensitive to their commercial flight flying over an area where military ordnance is being hurled around."" Delta Air Lines and American Airlines, the parent company of US Airways, both suspended service to Ben Gurion Airport before the FAA notice was issued. The Lufthansa Group has suspended flights to Israel for the next 36 hours, including Lufthansa's Austrian Airlines and Swiss International Air Lines flights, according to a Lufthansa official. Dutch flag carrier KLM has canceled a flight to Israel that was due to depart Tuesday evening. The company said it is still looking into whether future flights will be canceled. The airport is the premier gateway between Israel and the rest of the world. ""Perhaps no other airport in the world has been the focus of so many terror threats for so long. But Ben Gurion Airport has a remarkable safety record. It is one of the most secure airports in the world,"" said CNN anchor John Vause, who previously spent three years as a Jerusalem-based correspondent. ""Israel has invested a lot to keep the airport safe, and many within Israel will be extremely concerned if it is now within reach of Hamas rockets,"" Vause said. Vause was on Delta Air Lines Flight 468, which was en route Tuesday from New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport to Tel Aviv when it was diverted to Paris' Charles de Gaulle Airport. It's very unusual for the FAA to prohibit U.S. carriers from flying to a particular airport, said Mary Schiavo, a former U.S. Department of Transportation inspector general, via e-mail. ""The FAA does not like to restrict flight operations,"" Schiavo said via e-mail. ""In the past when the FAA has done it there have been diplomatic consequences."" The Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 tragedy last week likely affected the decision, she said. Aviation security expert Richard Bloom agreed that MH17 played a part in the decision to restrict flights. ""Another part of it is the actual war going between Hamas and Israel. Hamas has displayed some surprises -- how many missiles they have and how far they can go. That explains why a number of (airlines) are getting out,"" said Bloom, director of terrorism, intelligence and security studies at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. ""It's extremely, extremely difficult to protect a commercial aircraft,"" he said. Travel agents are scrambling to inform and rebook travelers. ""We are in touch with all our clients, and we're obviously helping to move them to another airline,"" said Iris Hami, owner of Gil Travel in Philadelphia. Hami said her agency is working closely with Israel's El Al Airlines. El Al continued to operate its regular schedule Tuesday, including up to five flights a day from the U.S., according to the airline. Hami said she's rebooking to an El Al flight a group of more than 100 travelers that was scheduled to fly US Airways to Israel Tuesday night. The flight suspensions come a day after the U.S. State Department asked Americans to consider deferring nonessential travel to Israel and the West Bank. Monday's travel warning reaffirmed existing guidance against any travel to Gaza, which the State Department said ""is under the control of Hamas, a foreign terrorist organization."" The department urged U.S. citizens already in Gaza to depart immediately. Other governments are cautioning their citizens against some or all travel to the region. The United Kingdom's Foreign and Commonwealth Office on Monday issued an advisory against all travel to Gaza and noted areas of possible violence in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza. In an alert issued Sunday, Canada advised its citizens to use a ""high degree of caution"" while traveling in Israel. The government advises against travel to Gaza and areas bordering Gaza, Syria and Egypt. Last year, Israel received a record 3.5 million visitors, according to the country's Central Bureau of Statistics. Before the recent violence, the bureau reported a record 1.4 million visitors for the first half of 2014, but the escalating violence is likely to put a damper on the numbers. Visitors to Israel should familiarize themselves with the nearest bomb shelters in case of attack and should avoid areas of Israel near Gaza because of the possibility of attacks from Gaza ""with little or no warning,"" the U.S. State Department advisory says.

"Jerusalem (CNN)A Palestinian man rammed his car into commuters waiting at a light rail stop in Jerusalem on Wednesday, killing a baby and wounding several other people, Israeli police said. The driver of the vehicle was shot as he tried to flee, police said. He later died, according to hospital officials. Israeli police spokesman Mickey Rosenfeld called it an apparent ""intentioned event"" and terror attack. The 3-month-old baby girl was one of eight people initially injured in the incident, according to Israeli Medical Services. She later died, according to a tweet posted by Rosenfeld. ""Baby dies of injuries in hospital after this evening's terror attack in Jerusalem,"" the tweet reads. ""Hospitals treating injured in different conditions."" In Washington, the U.S. State Department condemned the attack and said the baby was ""reportedly an American citizen, who was killed in this despicable attack."" A surveillance camera captured the horrific scene, which has been posted on social media. It shows a speeding car veering right, cutting across two lanes, mounting the station pavement and plowing through the people waiting at the stop. A hospital identified the driver as 20-year old Abdulrahman Shallodi, according to the Palestinian-run Silwan Information Center. Rosenfeld said in a tweet that the driver was an Arab resident of Silwan who had served time in an Israeli prison.

"(CNN)The most deadly Islamist terrorist attack ever in France followed weeks of warnings from French officials that the threat had risen to unprecedented levels. Late last year French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said his country had never faced a greater terrorist threat. Officials tell CNN the threat of terrorist attack in the European Union is greater than at any time since 9/11 because of the emergence of jihadist safe havens in Syria and Iraq. But no country faces a greater terrorist threat than France, with support for ISIS running deep among disenfranchised immigrant communities in the rundown, crime-ridden banlieues that surround many French cities. The numbers tell the story: 390 French extremists are now fighting with jihadist groups in Syria and Iraq, according to French officials, with 231 believed to be on their way. Fifty-one have been killed in suicide bombings and combat. And 234 have left the conflict zone, with 185 now back in France. Since the summer of 2013, French police say they have thwarted five terror plots. Nerves were rattled in the run up to Christmas after a knife attack in a police station in Tours and car-ramming attacks in Dijon and Nantes on three consecutive days. The Tours attack was the only one of the three that was definitively linked to Islamist terrorism. A few days after posting an ISIS flag on his Facebook page, Bertrand Nzohabonayo, a French-Burundian extremist, entered a police station in the central French town of Tours on Dec. 20 and stabbed several officers before being shot dead. ISIS threats to France . ISIS has explicitly called for lone-wolf terrorist attacks in France because of its participation in airstrikes in Iraq by the U.S.-led coalition. ""If you are not able to find an IED or a bullet, then single out the disbelieving American, Frenchman or any of their allies. Smash his head with a rock or slaughter him with a knife or run him over with your car or throw him down from a high place or choke him or poison him,"" ISIS spokesman Abu Muhammad al Adnani stated in an audiotape in September. On Nov. 19, three French ISIS fighters appeared in a French language video put out by the group's propaganda arm, repeating the call for attacks in France. One of them stated: . ""Terrorize them and do not allow them to sleep due to fear and horror. There are weapons and cars available and targets ready to be hit. Even poison is available, so poison the water and food of at least one of the enemies of Allah. Kill them and spit in their faces and run over them with your cars. Do whatever you are able to do in order to humiliate them, for they deserve only this."" A significant number of the nearly 400 French nationals now fighting in Syria and Iraq are believed to have joined ISIS. That includes Maxime Hauchard, a 22-year-old convert from Normandy who French authorities suspect participated in the grisly on-camera beheading of more than a dozen members of the Syrian armed forces in November orchestrated by the British ""Jihadi John."" French officials have for some time been worried that those on their way back to France -- or already back in the country -- could launch attacks. In February, police in Cannes broke up an alleged plot to bomb targets in France by Ibrahim Boudina, a French-Algerian extremist who had allegedly just returned from fighting with ISIS in Syria. Police say they found almost a kilogram of the high explosive TATP in his family's Cannes apartment building. Boudina has denied the allegations against him. ISIS-linked terror on the French Riviera . Mehdi Nemmouche, a French-Algerian ISIS fighter who allegedly helped guard Western hostages in Syria before returning to Europe, allegedly shot and killed four people at a Jewish museum in Brussels in May. Nemmouche was arrested in France and extradited to face trial in Belgium. He has denied the charges. In both the Cannes and Brussels plots, investigators believe it is possible the men were acting on their own steam. No evidence has been publicly released suggesting ISIS leadership signed off on the plots. It is not just ISIS causing concern to French security officials. European counterterrorism officials tell CNN a relatively high number of French extremists have joined ISIS rival Jabhat al Nusra, al Qaeda's affiliate in Syria. Of most concern: David Drugeon, a French convert from Brittany who has emerged as one of the most skilled bomb makers in the Khorasan group, an al Qaeda A-team based in Syria's Idlib province with ties to Jabhat al Nusra. U.S. officials tell CNN they believe Drugeon has been working on nonmetallic explosive devices that the group hoped to smuggle on board Western passenger aircraft and has been talent-spotting European extremists in Syria who can be trained for attacks in Europe. Drugeon was injured in a U.S. drone strike that hit a vehicle he was traveling in November. Khorasan bomb maker thought dead survived . New laws, old grievances . In November, France adopted tough new anti-terror legislation making it easier to shut down jihadist websites and confiscate passports and identity cards of those suspected of wanting to travel overseas to fight jihad. But critics say the French government has done too little to tackle one of the key contributing factors to radicalization: The deep sense of alienation toward mainstream society felt by a significant number of young Muslim immigrants in the banlieues. In the years after 9/11, France was held up as a model by many for its ""assimilationist"" agenda and its zero tolerance of extremist radical preachers. Britain, by contrast, was criticized for a ""multicultural"" approach that for too long offered political refuge to extremists from around the world. But by the late 2000s, Islamist extremism had also become a significant problem in France. Although French leaders paid lip service to assimilation, the concept was only theoretical for young unemployed Muslims living in impoverished banlieues whose socioeconomic grievances were more acute than their counterparts in the United Kingdom. While France could crack down on radical preachers in the 1990s, it was powerless to prevent the growth of jihadist websites and social media in the second half of the 2000s. Jihad in Syria has become a ""cause celebre"" for French extremists able to access this content online. While many British extremists traveled to al Qaeda's safe havens in Afghanistan and Pakistan in the years before and after 9/11 because of their language and kinship ties to the region, much of France's banlieue population hails from North Africa, making travel to jihadist battlegrounds in the Arab world easier and more attractive.","Most deadly Islamist terrorist attack ever in France followed weeks of warnings from French officials .

"To those of us who have studied the largest wave of immigration in history from a single country to the United States -- the four-decade-long influx of millions of Mexicans -- it seemed inconceivable that it would ever come to a halt. Yet, as our new Pew Hispanic Center report has shown, it has. Our analysis of Mexican and U.S. data sources indicates that at least as many Mexicans and their families are leaving the United States as are arriving in the United States from Mexico. As a result, the Mexican-born population in the United States decreased from 12.6 million in 2007 to 12 million in 2011. This appears to be the first sustained decline in the number of Mexican immigrants since the Great Depression, and it is entirely because of a reduction in illegal immigration -- more going home and fewer coming. Today, we estimate that 51% of all Mexican immigrants living in the United States are unauthorized.  In 2007, that figure was 56%. Even with the recent decline, Mexicans are still by far the largest single immigrant group in the United States, accounting for 30% of the foreign-born. The population of Mexican immigrants in the United States is larger than that of most countries or states: 10% of Mexican-born people worldwide live in the United States. No other nation in the world has as many of its people living abroad as does Mexico. What caused the big immigration wave to stop? We think that many factors were at work, on both sides of the border. We cannot say how much of a role each of them played in tamping down migration to the United States and setting up the large reverse flows, but they all seem to have had an impact. The sharp decline began about five years ago, around the time  the U.S. housing market collapsed. Many construction jobs held by Mexican immigrants vanished. The continued weakness in the overall U.S. economy made it harder to find other jobs as well. Although the Great Recession has officially ended, the job market is not back to what it was. During these same years, U.S. officials have heightened enforcement of immigration laws along the border and elsewhere. Unauthorized border-crossers have faced harsher penalties, and deportations have risen. We estimate that anywhere from 5% to 35% of the Mexicans who went home over the past five years did so involuntarily. Six states, including Arizona, have passed laws intended to reduce unauthorized immigration. For these and other reasons, it has become more dangerous to try to cross the border from Mexico. Developments on the Mexican side of the border also could be affecting migration flows. Mexico's economy, like that in the United States, fell into a deep recession from 2007 to 2009. But in 2010 and 2011, the Gross Domestic Product there grew at higher rates than the U.S. GDP, so Mexicans enjoyed a somewhat stronger recovery that may have encouraged some to stay home and others to return. Another change in Mexico that is just beginning to affect migration streams is a steep decline in birth rates. In 1960, the fertility rate in Mexico was 7.3 -- meaning, on average, a Mexican woman could expect to have seven children in her lifetime. In 2009, it had dropped to 2.4. Declining birth rates have pushed up the median age of the Mexican population. This has meant that the age group in the prime years for emigration, 15- to 39-year-olds, is a shrinking share of Mexico's population. Will the net standstill in migration from Mexico continue? We do not know, in part because of uncertainties about economic trends in both nations and future trends in enforcement policies. The decline in Mexican birth rates, however, does appear to be a long-term change that will limit the size of the pool of young people who are the most likely to emigrate. But even if Mexican immigration does begin to rise again, consider how far it has fallen. From 1995 through 2000, we estimate that 3 million Mexicans moved to the United States, and nearly 700,000, including family members born in the United States, went home. From 2005 through 2010, we estimate that about 1.4 million Mexicans arrived, and the same number,  including U.S.-born children, left. Considering everything, a return to the migration levels of the late 1990s now seems inconceivable.","Researchers: As many Mexicans are leaving the U.S. as they are arriving from Mexico .

"A Las Vegas couple who gunned down two police officers and a civilian before killing themselves apparently looked at law enforcement as oppressors, a sheriff's department official said Monday. Among the clues: a ""Don't Tread on Me"" flag and a Nazi swastika the couple placed on one of the police officers they ambushed Sunday at a pizza restaurant. They pinned onto the other officer's body a note saying something to the effect of ""this is the beginning of the revolution,"" Second Assistant Sheriff Kevin McMahill told reporters. ""We don't necessarily believe that they are white supremacists or associated with the Nazi movement. We believe that they equate government and law enforcement ... with Nazis,"" McMahill said. ""In other words, they believe that law enforcement is the oppressor."" Police said Monday that Jerad Miller shot Officer Igor Soldo in the back of the head, then shot fellow Officer Alyn Beck in the neck before Miller's wife, Amanda, pulled a gun from her purse and also fired on Beck. Who were the victims? They then ran to a nearby Walmart where they shot and killed a bystander before barricading themselves inside the store during a brief firefight with responding officers. Amanda Miller shot her husband repeatedly as officers closed in on them inside the Walmart, McMahill said. She then turned the gun on herself. Police are still in the early stages of their investigation. At this point though, they believe the couple acted alone and that the officers shot were targeted at random. Investigators searched an apartment late Sunday night that was believed to be where the couple lived. They were going through the couple's social media postings, McMahill said Monday. Police also recovered hundreds of rounds of ammunition from the couple's backpacks at Walmart, suggesting they were prepared for a lengthy gunbattle at some point, he added. ""There is no doubt that the suspects have some apparent ideology that's along the lines of militia and white supremacists,"" McMahill said. 'Simply having lunch' The pair began their attack about 11:20 a.m. Sunday, when they opened fire inside the restaurant where Beck, 41, and Soldo, 31, were having lunch. ""I just sat down to have lunch. The officers were sitting in front of me, at the table right next to me, and this man came in out of nowhere,"" a dazed Sheree Burns told CNN affiliate KTNV. ""I thought he was going to get a drink, the way he walked up and walked past them. And then he turned around, pulled a gun on his right and shot the bald officer in front of me."" ""What precipitated this event, we do not know,"" Sheriff Doug Gillespie said. ""My officers were simply having lunch."" The suspects took the officers' guns and ammunition, McMahill told reporters. They ""made a statement  -- something to the effect of, 'This is a revolution.' "" 'Suicide pact' As they walked out, they passed Alvaro Lopez. ""They had a backpack, and I saw a gun in their hand,"" Lopez told CNN affiliate KLAS. ""He just told me to tell the cops that it was a revolution and that he'd just killed two cops inside CiCi's."" The pair ran to Walmart where Jerad Miller fired off one round and told people to get out, McMahill said. A shopper, identified as Joseph Wilcox, told his friend he was going to confront the suspects. ""He was carrying a concealed weapon, and he immediately and heroically moved towards the position of Jerad Miller. Upon completing that action, he did not realize that Amanda Miller was with Jerad Miller,"" McMahill told reporters. He continued: ""As soon as he began to confront Jerad Miller with his firearm, Amanda Miller removed her firearm and shot him one time in the ribs area where he immediately collapsed."" Wilcox, 31, ""died attempting to protect others,"" Gillespie said. Shoppers rushed toward the exit. Officers converged and exchanged fire with the couple, holding the Millers to the rear of the store. At one point, Jerad Miller built a defensive position around his wife. She was seated and appeared to be suffering from a gunshot wound, McMahill told reporters. He then laid on his stomach in front of Amanda, who fired several rounds into her husband, killing him. ""At that point, Amanda took her handgun and ended her own life with one gunshot wound to the head,"" said McMahill, describing the deaths as the result of a ""suicide pact."" Opinion: Honor my brave friend, a good cop . 'See something, say something' The couple had been staying with Kelley Fielder, who called Amanda Miller her best friend. She said she saw the pair leave the home early Sunday carrying weapons and ammunition. ""I got five deaths on my shoulders. I should have called the cops,"" Fielder said, crying. ""I'm so so so sorry -- to everybody. I'm sorry."" A woman who says she lived near the couple told CNN affiliate KTNV that the married couple liked to dress up as the villainous ""Batman"" characters Joker and Harley Quinn. The neighbor, Krista Koch, told the station the man also sometimes dressed as Slenderman, a fictional horror character that recently surfaced in the stabbing of a 12-year-old girl in Wisconsin. Ghoulish stabbing raises question: Who is Slenderman? Koch also told the station the couple had told her they were going to carry out an attack, but she thought they were ""crazy,"" so she dismissed what they said. McMahill told reporters he'd heard unconfirmed reports the suspects spoke to a neighbor about the attack before it happened. ""You know we have the 'see something, say something' campaign,"" he said, urging people to call police when something doesn't feel right. ""We need to hear about those times when individuals or groups of individuals are talking about going out and committing acts of violence -- whether it's against the police or anybody else in our community,"" McMahill said. ""We need to hear from our citizens. They're the best eyes and ears that we have out there."" 'Emptiness in our heart' Beck and Soldo -- the two officers killed -- were both married with children: Beck left behind a wife and three children; Soldo, a wife and a baby. A prayer vigil is planned Monday night, KTNV reported. Meanwhile, Las Vegas police will be doubling up in patrol cars for at least the next few days as officers mourn the loss of two colleagues. ""We still have a community to police and we still have a community to protect,"" Gillespie said Sunday night. ""We will be out there doing it with our heads held high but with an emptiness in our heart."" Canada shooting: Suspect yelled 'I'm done' at time of arrest .

"Some of the most political, partisan and competitive women in politics compete on the same team -- a softball team, anyway.

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari signed into law Monday a peace deal for the nation's violence-plagued Swat Valley, according to a presidential spokesman. Women wearing burqas in North West Frontier Province. The deal implements Islamic law, or sharia, in the Swat Valley region of North West Frontier Province. Last week, pro-Taliban cleric Sufi Mohammad announced he was pulling out of a peace deal for Swat Valley, saying the government was not serious about implementing Islamic law, or sharia, in the region. Pakistani Interior Minister Rehman Malik said Saturday the peace deal remained intact. Mohammad brokered a cease-fire in February between the Pakistani government and his son-in-law, Maulana Fazlullah, who commands the Taliban in Swat Valley. Although details of the deal were not immediately available, it was understood that the area will come under the Taliban's strict interpretation of sharia. The central government has little control in the area, but it launched an intense military offensive in late July 2008 to flush out militants from areas of the North West Frontier Province. As retaliation for the military presence, the Taliban carried out a series of deadly attacks, beheadings and destruction of girls' schools. They also continued to gain ground, setting up checkpoints throughout the area. Pakistan is under enormous pressure to control the militants within its borders. The militants are blamed for launching attacks in neighboring Afghanistan, where U.S. and NATO forces are fighting militants. Swat Valley was once one of Pakistan's biggest tourist destinations. It is near the Afghanistan border and is 186 miles (300 kilometers) from the capital, Islamabad.","Presidential spokesman says deal gives sharia law a role in Swat Valley .

"So why would Yahoo -- the original king of Internet discussion groups -- pay over $1 billion for a simple little blog-publishing tool like Tumblr?  Doesn't the giant Web company have the ability to create its own application that lets people post words and pictures online? Of course it does. No, Yahoo isn't buying a technology company so much as the community that uses it. It paid a billion bucks for Tumblr for the very same reason that Facebook paid a billion dollars last year for web-sharing app Instagram: for the kids. That's right, the net's biggest corporations are willing to pay through the nose to acquire teenagers -- that coveted yet slippery demographic for whom the Web is a tired old workplace, Facebook is their parents' (or grandparents') social network, and Yahoo has something to do with stock quotes and sports scores. A new generation of apps and networks -- from Tumblr and Instagram to Snapchat and Pinterest -- has emerged alongside this new generation of users, and if traditional companies can't beat them, they may as well buy them. Teens and young 20-somethings have been drifting away from what over-30s people think of as the Internet for years now. The World Wide Web is flat, static, and largely dependent on desktop and laptop computers to work right. Younger people are much less likely to connect to the net -- or to each other -- through these cumbersome devices than they are to use smartphones. The mobile Web, as it's called, works differently. It's navigated by thumb, through separate apps, and in shorthand. The big websites and search engines of yesteryear (well, at least yesterweek) -- like Yahoo, for example -- just weren't built for this kind of light engagement. They're meant for keyboards and mice, not swiping and txt shorthand. Meanwhile, the corporations running big websites and social networks might seem like upstarts to older users, but to young people they are pre-existing conditions of the universe. Just as the Beatles might as well be Frank Sinatra, Facebook might as well be Microsoft or IBM. The big established networks just aren't cool. Mark Zuckerberg is already almost 30. Plus, his social network -- just like those of his peers at Google+ -- feels unnecessarily complex and requires a big commitment. Everything one does in the adult social media world goes down on one's permanent record. The experience on a site like Facebook is so involved -- friends lists, updates, photo streams, timelines, advertisements -- from the teen perspective, it's a Whole Big Thing. Compare that to something like Instagram. You take a picture and it goes up and out. That's it. Or Snapchat:  You take a picture and it goes to a friend, and then it disappears. How cool is that? The less weighty and permanent and stickily complex a social networking experience, the less it feels like it's the province of marketers, too. Every keystroke, recommendation, follow, like and update is recorded and stored. Kids are becoming aware that the more involved the data footprint they create somewhere, the more it will be used against them by big data researchers looking to predict their future activities and then market to them the things they don't yet know they're about to desire. Which is just creepy. This is why the real job of younger companies is to prove they are not your parents' social apps. That's why it becomes particularly challenging when a hip ""young person's"" social app is swallowed by a big, old, uncool Web company. After Tumblr's base of young users found out about the sale, they went into a near state of panic. Many posted on Twitter and elsewhere how this represents the end of an era, and how they are now destined to move on to the next frontier. For its part, Tumblr is working hard to prove it still has indie cool street cred. In his blog post responding to the angst around his ""selling out,"" Tumblr founder David Karp sounded like a young Steve Jobs by insisting ""how awesome this is."" Then, as if to prove Tumblr is still cool enough to do naughty things even though it's now owned by a zillion-dollar corporate conglomerate, he signed his post, ""F*** yeah."" Maybe that'll work, but it looks to me like Tumblr has gone from being cool to trying to sound cool. And we all know where that leads.","Douglas Rushkoff: Web giant Yahoo bought Tumblr for $1 billion to attract young people .

"The parents of Michael Brown, a Missouri teen killed by police, testified before a U.N. committee Tuesday because they want the world to know ""what's going on in Ferguson."" Lesley McSpadden and Michael Brown Sr. spoke to the United Nations Committee Against Torture -- which also works against cruel or degrading treatment or punishment by government authorities. ""We need the world to know what's going on in Ferguson and we need justice,"" McSpadden told CNN in Geneva, Switzerland. Gov. Jay Nixon: Protest violence 'cannot be repeated' ""We need answers and we need action. And we have to bring it to the U.N. so they can expose it to the rest of the world, what's going on in small town Ferguson."" Accounts differ as to what led to the August shooting of Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, by a white police officer. What happened when Michael Brown met Officer Darren Wilson . While their testimony to the committee took place behind closed doors, the delegation that organized their trip said the couple would read from a statement submitted by the Brown family and organizations called HandsUpUnited, the Organization for Black Struggle, and Missourians Organizing for Reform and Empowerment. The document says Brown's killing and force used by police officers during protests that followed the killing ""represent violations of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment."" Read the full statement . It requests that the U.N. panel recommend the immediate arrest of Officer Darren Wilson, who killed Brown, as well as an end to ""racial profiling and racially-biased police harassment across the jurisdictions surrounding Ferguson."" Ferguson authorities have repeatedly denied similar accusations in the past. The statement also calls for recommendations that would apply to the entire United States, including that the attorney general and Department of Justice ""must conduct a nationwide investigation of systematic police brutality and harassment in black and brown communities, and youth in particular. Methodology and findings of this investigation must be made publicly available."" Gun sales spike as Ferguson area braces for grand jury decision . Attorneys: Time for 'global intervention' In a statement, the Browns' attorney's office said the couple planned to ""testify on behalf of many supporters who join in the appeal for global intervention in the way policing currently functions in America.""

""They've given us a lot of love and support since we've been here. Everything seems to be positive.  It's a great experience."" Michael Brown Sr. said he and his wife were offering ""an outlook on what's going on in the United States and all over the world with the police, police brutality, no justice."" Speaking of what life has been like since the killing, he said, ""It's a situation where I'm surprised we haven't even lost our mind yet over this.  But we're being strong.  Hopefully, justice will prevail."" The trip came as the parents, and many people throughout the United States, brace for the results of grand jury deliberations -- which will determine whether Wilson, 28, is indicted. The trip was organized by the U.S. Human Rights Network, which is based in New York and Atlanta, KSDK reported. ""Traditionally, if you look at the history of the Convention Against Torture, this is the correct location for claims of police violence,"" St. Louis University Assistant Professor Justin Hansford, one of the co-authors of the brief, told KSDK. The Committee Against Torture ""is the body of 10 independent experts that monitors implementation of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment by its State parties,"" the U.N.

"A suicide bomber targeted a funeral in northwest Pakistan on Sunday, killing at least 14 people and wounding 37 others, officials said. The blast took place just outside Peshawar, the capital of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, said city police official Kalam Khan.

Khushdil Khan, a party member who is the deputy speaker of the provincial assembly, had gone to the funeral for a local woman. But he left before the suicide bomber walked up to mourners and blew himself up as they were leaving, police said . The Awami National Party, which is part of the governing coalition led by Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani's Pakistan Peoples Party, is often targeted by the Taliban. In February, an explosion outside a political rally in northwest Pakistan killed five people and wounded 10, officials said. The Tehrik-e-Taliban, or Pakistani Taliban, claimed responsibility for the blast. ""We carried out the attack,"" said Asim Mehsud, the Taliban spokesman for Pakistan's South Waziristan region. ""We will also target upcoming rallies of the Awami National Party, as it is a secular party. We will also target any other rallies conducted by secular political parties in the future."" In November, party member Hanif Jadoon and his bodyguard were killed in a suicide attack.

But we both recognize that, though we have come a long way from the old injustices that once stained our nation's reputation and denied some Americans the full blessings of American citizenship, the memory of them still had the power to wound. A century ago, President Theodore Roosevelt's invitation of Booker T. Washington to dine at the White House was taken as an outrage in many quarters. America today is a world away from the cruel and frightful bigotry of that time. There is no better evidence of this than the election of an African-American to the presidency of the United States. Let there be no reason now for any American to fail to cherish their citizenship in this, the greatest nation on Earth. Sen. Obama has achieved a great thing for himself and for his country. I applaud him for it, and offer him my sincere sympathy that his beloved grandmother did not live to see this day. Though our faith assures us she is at rest in the presence of her creator and so very proud of the good man she helped raise. Sen. Obama and I have had and argued our differences, and he has prevailed. No doubt many of those differences remain. These are difficult times for our country. And I pledge to him tonight to do all in my power to help him lead us through the many challenges we face. I urge all Americans who supported me to join me in not just congratulating him, but offering our next president our good will and earnest effort to find ways to come together to find the necessary compromises to bridge our differences and help restore our prosperity, defend our security in a dangerous world, and leave our children and grandchildren a stronger, better country than we inherited. Whatever our differences, we are fellow Americans. And please believe me when I say no association has ever meant more to me than that. It is natural. It's natural, tonight, to feel some disappointment. But tomorrow, we must move beyond it and work together to get our country moving again. We fought -- we fought as hard as we could. And though we fell short, the failure is mine, not yours. I am so deeply grateful to all of you for the great honor of your support and for all you have done for me. I wish the outcome had been different, my friends. The road was a difficult one from the outset, but your support and friendship never wavered. I cannot adequately express how deeply indebted I am to you. I'm especially grateful to my wife, Cindy, my children, my dear mother and all my family, and to the many old and dear friends who have stood by my side through the many ups and downs of this long campaign. I have always been a fortunate man, and never more so for the love and encouragement you have given me. You know, campaigns are often harder on a candidate's family than on the candidate, and that's been true in this campaign. All I can offer in compensation is my love and gratitude and the promise of more peaceful years ahead. I am also -- I am also, of course, very thankful to Gov. Sarah Palin, one of the best campaigners I've ever seen, and an impressive new voice in our party for reform and the principles that have always been our greatest strength, her husband Todd and their five beautiful children for their tireless dedication to our cause, and the courage and grace they showed in the rough and tumble of a presidential campaign. We can all look forward with great interest to her future service to Alaska, the Republican Party and our country. To all my campaign comrades, from Rick Davis and Steve Schmidt and Mark Salter, to every last volunteer who fought so hard and valiantly, month after month, in what at times seemed to be the most challenged campaign in modern times, thank you so much. A lost election will never mean more to me than the privilege of your faith and friendship. I don't know -- I don't know what more we could have done to try to win this election. I'll leave that to others to determine. Every candidate makes mistakes, and I'm sure I made my share of them. But I won't spend a moment of the future regretting what might have been. This campaign was and will remain the great honor of my life, and my heart is filled with nothing but gratitude for the experience and to the American people for giving me a fair hearing before deciding that Sen. Obama and my old friend Sen. Joe Biden should have the honor of leading us for the next four years. I would not -- I would not be an American worthy of the name should I regret a fate that has allowed me the extraordinary privilege of serving this country for a half a century. Today, I was a candidate for the highest office in the country I love so much. And tonight, I remain her servant. That is blessing enough for anyone, and I thank the people of Arizona for it. Tonight -- tonight, more than any night, I hold in my heart nothing but love for this country and for all its citizens, whether they supported me or Sen. Obama -- whether they supported me or Sen. Obama. I wish Godspeed to the man who was my former opponent and will be my president. And I call on all Americans, as I have often in this campaign, to not despair of our present difficulties, but to believe, always, in the promise and greatness of America, because nothing is inevitable here. Americans never quit. We never surrender. We never hide from history. We make history. Thank you, and God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you all very much.","McCain: Sen.

"(CNN)Legendary fashion designer Oscar de la Renta, who spent half a century putting high society in haute couture, has died. He was 82. The man -- often described as the ""sultan of suave"" -- dressed every first lady since Jacqueline Kennedy. Among those whose glamor factor his dresses jazzed up: Oprah Winfrey, Ann Hathaway and, most recently, George Clooney's bride Amal Alamuddin. ""We will always remember him as the man who made women look and feel beautiful,"" former first lady Laura Bush said late Monday night. De la Renta designed the wedding dress for her daughter, Jenna. The cause of his death, announced by close family friends and industry colleagues, was not immediately clear. He was diagnosed with cancer in 2006, but said last year he was ""totally clean."" ""The only realities in life are that you are born, and that you die,"" he told an audience at New York's 92Y ""Fashion Talks"" series in June 2013. ""We always think we are going to live forever. The dying aspect we will never accept. The one thing about having this kind of warning is how you appreciate every single day of life."" And what a life he lived. ""He was a true, true gentlemen, in the truest sense of the word -- a real bright light -- and this is just a terrible, terrible loss for the fashion world,"" said Alina Cho, fashion journalist and editor at large at Random House. Beginnings . Born July 22, 1932, in the Dominican Republic, de la Renta was the only son among seven children. ""My father had different aspirations for me than I had for myself,"" he told the ""Fashion Talks"" audience. ""If I ever told my father I would become a fashion designer, he would drop dead on the spot."" He has often said the island colored his design sense. ""From my island side comes my love for the exotic, for color and light,"" he told the New York Times. At 18, he left for Spain to study at the Academy of San Fernando in Madrid. For a time, he dabbled in abstract art. But fashion was his passion, he soon discovered. After the wife of the U.S. Ambassador to Spain saw some of his dress sketches, she commissioned him to design a gown for her daughter. The daughter and the dress appeared on the cover of Life magazine. Emboldened, de la Renta switched his focus to fashion. He landed an apprenticeship with Cristobal Balenciaga, who was at the time Spain's most acclaimed designer. He described that period as the beginning of his learning experience. ""I was picking pins off the floor,"" he joked. Ascent . Next stop, and the obvious next step for a fashion designer: Paris. De la Renta was in the fashion mecca on vacation. But within a day of his arrival, he was offered a job at the reputed fashion house, Lanvin. He finessed his style, learned to tailor, and, two years later, moved to New York -- where he became a designer for Elizabeth Arden. It was the first step toward a career that would make him a fashion powerhouse. In 1965, the Oscar de la Renta brand was launched, changing the face of fashion with its ready-to-wear collection. ""My customers are successful working women,"" he said. From there, he branched into fragrance, then into a home line, then into furniture. ""I'm a very restless person. I'm always doing something. The creative process never stops,"" he once said. Atop . Admired by contemporaries, adored by consumers, de la Renta had a long, successful run. He was the winner of numerous Cody awards, the fashion equivalent of the Oscars. His creations were a fixture on the red carpet and in the Oval Office. He dressed Nancy Reagan and provided the inaugural gown for Laura Bush. He is also responsible for the look Hillary Clinton is so inextricably associated with: the pantsuit. ""This man has been working for more than 20 years to turn me into a fashion icon,"" Clinton joked while presenting him with the Medal of Excellence at Carnegie Hall last April. One notable holdout, until recently, was Michelle Obama. De la Renta waded into controversy after he took her to task for wearing a J. Crew cardigan to meet Queen Elizabeth in 2009. ""You don't go to Buckingham Palace in a sweater,"" he said. But, this month, Obama too sported an Oscar de la Renta creation at the Fashion Education Workshop at the White House. Endings . Rumors had been circulating for a while that de la Renta was ill. Last week, Oscar de la Renta -- the company -- announced the appointment of Peter Copping as creative director. ""Our Industry has not always done the best job when it comes to changes in design leadership. My hope is that, in leading this selection, and actively participating in the transition, I can insure the right design future for our company and brand,"" de la Renta said in a statement then. Then, Monday, came the news of his death. His first wife, Francoise de Langlade -- a former editor of French Vogue -- died of bone cancer in 1983. They had been married 16 years. He leaves behind his second wife, Annette Engelhard Reed, whom he married in 1989. He also leaves behind a son. ""The fashion business says goodbye to a mentor, a legand & an icon,"" designer Kenneth Cole tweeted Monday night. ""He defined a standard we can only aspire to.""

"Congress took up one of the most divisive issues in politics Thursday as the House of Representatives rejected a controversial measure banning abortions based on the sex of a fetus. In the House, 246 representatives backed the bill while 168 voted against it, leaving the proposal short of the two-thirds total necessary for passage. Most Republicans supported the measure; the majority of Democrats opposed it. Supporters characterized the proposal as a necessary defense of the civil rights of unborn children; opponents called it part of a broader so-called war on women and an ongoing assault on legalized abortion. The Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act would have imposed possible fines and prison sentences of up to five years on doctors who knowingly perform abortions chosen on grounds based on sex. Abortion providers could also have been subjected to civil penalties, including punitive monetary damages, under certain circumstances. Gallup poll: 'Pro-choice' at a record low . The issue is about ""whether or not in the land of the free and the home of the brave that we are going to allow little girls to be killed before they're born simply because they are little girls,"" Rep. Trent Franks, R-Arizona, said Thursday morning.  Franks was the bill's main sponsor. ""I would suggest to you that if that should become the accepted practice in America -- that we are no longer going to care about that -- then maybe it's time to board (Congress up) and go home and say we did our best but we just didn't quite make it."" Rep. Chris Smith, R-New Jersey, said that ""most people in government are unaware"" that abortion based on the sex of a fetus ""is part of a deliberate plan of population control that has now boomeranged and come to our own country."" ""This is the real war on women,"" he insisted. Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tennessee, argued Wednesday that it's ""hypocrisy to say that one is pro-woman and that it's OK to end the life of an unborn child just because of its gender."" ""Since when did America subscribe to the idea that males are worth more than females?"" she asked.  ""It's sick, it's discriminatory, it's sexist and it is blatantly anti-woman and anti-human."" Women's rights: Nuns' fight with Vatican highlights Catholicism's global struggle . Supporters of the measure cited multiple studies to back claims of a growing pattern of abortions based on the sex of the fetus. Opponents, however, took issue with certain interpretations of the studies, and warned of negative ramifications for women's health if the bill becomes law. Michigan Rep. John Conyers, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, asserted Wednesday that the bill ""tramples (on) the rights of women under the guise of nondiscrimination, while doing absolutely nothing to provide women with needed resources for their babies, female and male."" Citing opposition to the bill from groups such as the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, he said, ""If this measure is passed into law, we will then require that medical and mental health professionals violate ... doctor-patient confidentiality"" and report suspected violations to law enforcement authorities. Rep. Barbara Lee, D-California, said the bill's backers were ""exploiting serious issues like racism and sexism in a backdoor attempt to make abortion illegal."" ""Attempts to restrict or deny access to safe abortions is harmful to women's health and would ultimately take us back to the days of back-alley abortions,"" she said. House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, said nobody he has talked to favors abortion based on sex preferences, and the proposal was brought up simply ""because somebody decided politically it was a difficult place to put people in."" Drew Hammill, a spokesman for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, called the debate over the bill ""yet another distraction and yet another day that this Republican majority fails to act on job creation."" But Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said Thursday that banning abortion based on the sex of a fetus is an ""important issue to the American people."" ""This type of sex selection ... most  Americans find pretty repulsive,"" Boehner said. ""Our (Republican) members feel strongly about it. That's why it's being brought"" to a vote. Asked why the Republican-controlled House took up an abortion bill at a time when GOP leaders have called economic recovery their top concern, a spokesman for Boehner insisted Wednesday that the party's priorities had not changed. Planned Parenthood's new ad zeroes in on Romney . ""House Republicans are focused on the American people's top priorities: jobs and the economy,"" spokesman Michael Steel said. ""Dealing with a bill to prevent sex-selective abortion ... doesn't change that."" While Republican leaders wouldn't say why they brought up the bill under an expedited legislative process requiring a two-thirds vote for House approval, the maneuver avoided an extended argument over a divisive social issue with the potential to sidetrack the economic debate. Franks' bill came to a vote at a time when abortion, a perennial hot-button topic, has re-emerged as a political focal point. The anti-abortion rights group Live Action released two videos this week that is says shows Planned Parenthood staffers offering advice to a pair of women involved in a sting on how best to proceed with an abortion based on the sex of a fetus. Planned Parenthood, which provides a range of medical services for women, responded to the release of the videos by noting that one of the staff members in question -- a woman in Austin, Texas -- had lost her job because she failed to follow proper procedures for the organization. The organization insisted Thursday in a written statement, however, that the second staffer, based in New York, had provided ""nonjudgmental, informative services that are in accordance with social work standards for patient interaction."" The statement noted that Planned Parenthood ""opposes sex selection abortion and insists on the highest quality care. ... If any Planned Parenthood organization learns of an instance where a staff member has not fully followed policies or procedures, they take swift action and remedy the situation."" At the same time, the statement blasted Live Action's promotion of ""a series of hoax patient videotapes related to sex selection."" ""Edited videos of hoax patient visits are part of a coordinated campaign over the last several years to distort Planned Parenthood's services, mission and values,"" the statement said. Planned Parenthood's leadership jumped into the presidential contest Wednesday, unveiling a roughly $1.5 million ad campaign targeting Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney. The ad, which says Romney would deny women critical medical services, is set to run in the battleground states of Florida, Iowa and Virginia.","246 backed bill, 168 voted against it, leaving it short of the two-thirds needed for passage .

"(CNN)The chief political commentator at the Daily Telegraph has quit after describing the British newspaper's lack of coverage of the HSBC tax-dodging scandal as a ""fraud on its readers."" Peter Oborne, who had been at the London-based broadsheet since 2010, accused its executives of placing the interests of the bank -- a key advertiser -- above its duty to bring the story to its readers. He lamented the sharp fall in circulation and the arrival of a ""click culture"" at the newspaper, which meant stories were no longer judged by their importance, accuracy or appeal to those who actually bought it. ""With the collapse in standards has come a most sinister development,"" Oborne wrote Tuesday, in a rambling commentary published on opendemocracy.net. ""It has long been axiomatic in quality British journalism that the advertising department and editorial should be kept rigorously apart. There is a great deal of evidence that, at the Telegraph, this distinction has collapsed."" He was referring to the recent ""HSBC files"" case, where documents leaked to French authorities by a former HSBC employee, and then analyzed by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) accused the banking giant of using a secretive Swiss banking system to conceal the identities of account holders, and in many cases, help them avoid paying tax. Oborne pointed out that while the story was splashed across the front pages of its competitors for days, ""you needed a microscope to find the Telegraph coverage."" ""Nothing on Monday, six slim paragraphs at the bottom left of page two on Tuesday, seven paragraphs deep in the business pages on Wednesday,"" he wrote. ""The Telegraph's reporting only looked up when the story turned into claims that there might be questions about the tax affairs of people connected to the Labour party."" The Telegraph is a politically conservative title, largely supportive of Prime Minister David Cameron's Conservative Party. Shortly after Oborne's blistering attack, the newspaper hit back. ""It is a matter of huge regret that Peter Oborne, for nearly five years a contributor to the Telegraph, should have launched such an astonishing and unfounded attack, full of inaccuracy and innuendo, on his own paper."" An HSBC spokesperson declined to comment on Oborne's claims when contacted by CNN Wednesday. Oborne said this isn't the first time the newspaper had suppressed stories relating to HSBC. Last year, he recalled working on a piece about how prominent British Muslims had received letters out of the blue from HSBC informing them that their accounts had been closed. ""No reason was given, and it was made plain that there was no possibility of appeal,"" he wrote. When he tried to publish the story, he described being ""fobbed off"" and given non-existent legal issues as an excuse. ""When I pushed the point, an executive took me aside and said that 'there is a bit of an issue' with HSBC. Eventually I gave up in despair and offered the article to openDemocracy,"" he wrote. Oborne said the reporting on HSBC is part of a wider problem at the newspaper. He described the Telegraph's stance on last year's pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong as ""bizarre."" When rivals including The Guardian and The Times wrote in December about the refusal by the Chinese government to allow a committee of British lawmakers into the former UK colony, he said the Telegraph remained silent. In September that year, the newspaper published a commentary by the Chinese ambassador to Britain to coincide with what Oborne described as its ""lucrative"" China Watch supplement. It was given the headline ""Let's not allow Hong Kong to come between us."" When he expressed his concern about the direction the paper was taking, Oborne recalled a meeting with Murdoch MacLennan, the chief executive of the Telegraph Media Group. ""I told him that I was not leaving to join another paper. I was resigning as a matter of conscience. ""Mr. MacLennan agreed that advertising was allowed to affect editorial, but was unapologetic, saying that 'it was not as bad as all that' and adding that there was a long history of this sort of thing at the Telegraph,"" wrote Oborne.","Peter Oborne quits the Daily Telegraph and accuses it of being more concerned with advertisers .

"(CNN)A nurse contracts Ebola. An urgent care center in Boston shuts down when a sick man recently returned from Liberia walks in. Health care workers complain they haven't been properly trained to protect themselves against the deadly virus. Public health experts are asking whether the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is partly to blame. Here are five things they say the CDC is getting wrong. 1. The CDC is telling possible Ebola patients to ""call a doctor."" When passengers arrive in the United States from Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea, they're handed a flier instructing them to ""call a doctor"" if they feel ill. Never mind how hard it is to get your doctor on the phone, but even if you could, it's quite possible she'd tell you to go to the nearest emergency room or urgent care center. We saw how well that worked at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas. On September 25, the hospital sent a feverish Thomas Eric Duncan home even though he had told them he'd recently been to Liberia. And we've seen how well that worked in Massachusetts, where an ill man recently returned from Liberia walked into an urgent care center, which then evacuated its other patients and closed for several hours. One way to do it differently: Set up a toll free number for returning passengers that would reach a centralized office, which would then dispatch a local ambulance to get the patient to a hospital. The hospital would be warned that a possible Ebola patient is on the way, and the patient would not be brought through the main emergency room. That's the idea of Gavin Macgregor-Skinner, an assistant professor at Penn State's Department of Public Health Sciences. ""Do you really want someone with Ebola hopping on a bus to get to the hospital? No,"" he said. ""And once they get there, do you want them sitting in the waiting room next to the kid with the broken arm? Again, no."" CDC Director Tom Frieden faces rising tide of criticism . 2. The CDC director says any hospital can care for Ebola patients. ""Essentially any hospital in the country can safely take care of Ebola. You don't need a special hospital to do it,"" Dr. Thomas Frieden said Sunday at a press conference. ""I think it's very unfortunate that he keeps re-stating that,"" said Macgregor-Skinner, the global projects manager for the Elizabeth R. Griffin Foundation. He said when it comes to handling Ebola, not all hospitals are created equally. As seen at Presbyterian, using protective gear can be tricky. Plus, it's a challenge to handle infectious waste from Ebola patients, such as hospital gowns contaminated with blood or vomit. Dr. Michael Osterholm, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota,  said some hospitals have more experience with infectious diseases and consistently do drills in how to deal with biohazards. ""If you were a burn unit patient, wouldn't you want to go to a burn unit?"" he said. The CDC may already be moving in that direction. Designating certain hospitals as Ebola treatment units ""is something we're exploring further,"" said Tom Skinner, a spokesman for the agency. CDC 'doubling down' on Ebola training efforts . 3. The CDC didn't encourage the ""buddy system"" for doctors and nurses. Under this system, a doctor or nurse who is about to do a procedure on an Ebola patient has a ""buddy,"" another health care worker, who acts as a safety supervisor, monitoring the worker from the time he puts on the gear until the time he takes it off. The ""buddy system"" has been effective in stopping other kinds of infections in hospitals. Skinner said the CDC is considering recommending such a system to hospitals. 4. CDC didn't encourage doctors to develop Ebola treatment guidelines. Taking care of Ebola patients is tricky, because certain procedures might put doctors and nurses in contact with the patient's infectious bodily fluids. At Sunday's press conference, Frieden hinted that Presbyterian might have performed two measures -- inserting a breathing tube and giving kidney dialysis -- that were unlikely to help Duncan. He described them as a ""desperate measure"" to save his life. ""Both of those procedures may spread contaminated materials and are considered high-risk procedures,"" he said. ""I'm not familiar with any prior patient with Ebola who has undergone either intubation or dialysis."" Osterholm said CDC should coordinate with medical groups to come up with treatment guidelines. ""We could have and should have done it a few months ago,"" he said. 5. The CDC put too much trust in protective gear. Once Duncan was diagnosed, health authorities started making daily visits to 48 of his contacts. But that didn't include several dozen workers at Presbyterian who took care of Duncan after he was diagnosed. They weren't followed because they were wearing protective gear when they had contact with Duncan. Instead, they monitored themselves. Public health experts said that was a misstep, as the CDC should have realized that putting on and taking off protective gear is often done imperfectly and one of the workers might get an infection. How did Dallas nurse contract Ebola? ""We have to recognize that our safety work tells us that breaches of protocol are the norm, not the exception in health care,"" said Dr. Peter Pronovost, senior vice president for patient safety and quality at Johns Hopkins Medicine. ""We routinely break precautions."" Skinner said that in this case, self-monitoring worked, but that monitoring from health officials can be beneficial, too, and so health care workers who were involved in Duncan's care will now get daily visits from health authorities.","Public health experts question some CDC actions on Ebola .
Patients are told to ""call a doctor,"" but expert says an ambulance would be better .
Not just any hospital can care for Ebola patients, experts say ."
"(CNN) -- It was a night which evoked hatred of years past -- now both Serbia and Albania have been punished for their part in dramatic night of violence in Belgrade. Last week's Euro 2016 qualifying match was abandoned after 41 minutes following a brawl sparked by the arrival of a drone carrying a flag emblazoned with the insignia of 'Greater Albania.' European football's governing body UEFA ruled that the European Championship game be awarded 3-0 in Serbia's favor but also deducted three points from the host nation. Serbia has also been told it must play its next two Group I qualifiers behind closed doors while both football associations have been fined $126,410. In a statement, UEFA's Control Ethics and Disciplinary Body (CEDB) confirmed the punishment. ""The CEDB has decided to declare the above-mentioned match as forfeited. As a consequence, the Football Association of Albania (FShF) is deemed to have lost the match 3-0. In addition, the FShF has been fined â‚¬100,000 ($126,410) ""The CEDB has also decided to deduct the Football Association of Serbia (FSS) three points for the current UEFA European Championship qualifying competition. In addition, the FSS has been ordered to play its next two UEFA competition matches as host team behind closed doors. Finally, the association has been fined â‚¬100,000."" Under UEFA's disciplinary rules, the two nations are allowed to appeal the European governing body's decision. Serbia were formally charged with crowd disturbance, setting off fireworks, a pitch invasion, ""insufficient organization"" and the use of a laser pen. Albania were charged for the ""display of an illicit banner"" and refusing to play. The incident shocked the world of football as ethnic tensions between the two countries flared. The 'Greater Albania' insignia, which was attached to the drone, refers to the idea of an extended area in which all ethnic Albanians reside -- one which would include Kosovo. The two illustrated figures on the flag were Isa Boletini, an Albanian nationalist who led uprisings against the Serbs and Ottomans in 1912 and 1913, while the other, Ismail Qemali, is considered to be the founder of the modern Albanian state, which became independent in 1912. The word ""Autochthonous,"" which refers to an indigenous inhabitant of a place, was emblazoned at the bottom of the flag and is considered an offense to Serbians. When Serbian player Stefan Mitrovic took the flag down, it provided the catalyst for an already combustible tie to fully ignite. Albanian players ran from the field, a number of missiles and flares were thrown from the stands by some home supporters, while images from photo agencies showed fans invading the pitch. The visiting side also claimed its team bus was targeted by hooligans before the contest. Security had been tight in the lead up to the contest in Belgrade with away fans prevented from attending amidst heightening tensions over Kosovo -- a majority-Albanian former Serbian province which declared independence in 2008. In 1999, a 78-day air war was launched by NATO to stop the killing off ethnic Albanians in Kosovo by Serbian forces. Kosovo's independence is recognized by many countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany and France -- but not Serbia. Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama had been scheduled to visit Belgrade on October 22 -- the first such visit by an Albanian leader in 68 years. His visit, which will now take place on November 10, comes after his own brother, Olsi, was accused of piloting the drone inside the stadium by a Serbian government official -- an allegation he rejected. ""Today the justice has not been served regarding what had happened at the Belgrade stadium,"" the Albanian Prime Minister tweeted. The Albanian Football Association confirmed to CNN it is ready to appeal against the decision. Armand Duka, head of the association, told CNN that the ""punishments are clearly not proportional."" He also denied suggestions that Albanian players had refused to continue the contest following their departure from the field of play, labeling those allegations as a ""product of pure fantasy"". ""The Albanian team never refused the resume of the match,"" added Duka. ""The Albanian players declared that they were physically and mentally unable to play a football match. ""There is no reference in the official reports that emptying the stadium was the proper way to restore the security conditions. ""If in the opinion of the UEFA officials, this was the right thing to be done, they should empty the stadium and then resume the match and invite the Albanian players in the pitch, if they consider Albanian players as fit to play. ""We cannot regret a decision which we had not reached. It was inability to play, not refusal.""","Serbia and Albania both punished by UEFA following brawl in Euro 2016 qualifier .

"Leland Yee needed cash. First, the ambitious California state senator had to fund his 2011 race for mayor of San Francisco. When he came in fifth, he was stuck with $70,000 in campaign debt that he had to retire before he could mount his next run, for secretary of state -- a costly statewide venture. And that's how prosecutors say Yee ended up sitting across from an undercover federal agent in a coffee shop in early March, brokering what he was told was a $2 million arms deal that would include the purchase of shoulder-fired missiles from Islamic rebels in the Philippines. ""Do I think we can make some money? I think we can make some money,"" Yee told the agent in a conversation recounted in a 137-page arrest affidavit. ""Do I think we can get the goods? I think we can get the goods."" The veteran Democrat, an advocate for gun control and campaign finance reform in Sacramento, is now one of about two dozen people charged in a sprawling racketeering case brought by the U.S. attorney's office in San Francisco. His co-defendants include a former San Francisco school board president and a previously-convicted Chinatown mobster dubbed ""Shrimp Boy."" He's accused of putting his public office up for sale, and promising to push donors' agendas in Sacramento and in his district in exchange for contributions. The allegations have stunned his constituents in San Francisco and its suburbs and cast a shadow over his state Senate colleagues, who have suspended Yee and two other Democrats who have run afoul of the law in recent months. Yee has been free on $500,000 bond since his arrest. Though neither he nor his lawyer have commented to CNN on the allegations, the senator pleaded not guilty in a court appearance Tuesday morning. And he got a sort of backhanded defense from longtime California powerbroker Willie Brown. ""I don't think any of the allegations are anyplace close to any reality,"" Brown told CNN -- but he said that's because Yee lacked the clout to fulfill any of the pledges he made. ""There's no way anyone who is seriously trying to influence government by way of money would do it with Leland. Period. He couldn't deliver anything,"" said Brown, San Francisco's former mayor and onetime speaker of the State Assembly. 'Careful and cautious' The 65-year-old Yee came to the feds' attention during a five-year probe of the Chee Kung Tong, a Chinatown social club that agents describe as the hub of a coast-to-coast criminal enterprise. The original focus of the probe was the club's ""dragonhead,"" or leader, Raymond ""Shrimp Boy"" Chow -- a man the affidavit puts at the head of a racketeering ring that had its hands in money laundering, drug dealing, gunrunning, murder-for-hire plots and trafficking in stolen liquor and contraband cigarettes. Chow's lawyer, Tony Serra, proclaimed his client's innocence to reporters outside the courtroom Tuesday. Chow had pleaded guilty to racketeering in 2000, got a lighter sentence for cooperating with the government and still wears an ankle monitoring bracelet, court documents say. In this case, he fell victim to ""agent provocateurs"" who tried to lure him into a crime, Serra, said after Tuesday's hearing. ""It's a case where ultimately the government created the crime, the government financed the crime and the government ensnared my client, tantamount to entrapment,"" Serra said. But according to the court documents, Chow had taken two undercover FBI agents into his confidence. He introduced one, who was posing as a Mafia member from the East Coast, to Keith Jackson, a San Francisco political consultant and former school board president. Jackson started hitting up the agent for contributions for Yee, according to the charges. The agent refused at first. But then he introduced another undercover agent to meet with Yee, who offered to ""perform certain official acts"" in exchange for contributions to pay off his mayoral campaign debt, the affidavit recounts. Over the course of the next three years, prosecutors say Yee raked in about $50,000 from undercover agents, with Jackson acting as an intermediary. In exchange, according to the charges, Yee lobbied officials in suburban San Mateo County on behalf of a fake software company represented by one of the federal agents; promised to lobby colleagues on behalf of a medical marijuana bill that would have benefited the supposed interest of another donor; and for $6,800, secured a state Senate proclamation honoring the Chee Kung Tong. Though Yee periodically said he wasn't doing anything for his own benefit and raised concerns about crossing the line into unlawful ""pay-to-play"" tactics, he ""never walked away from any quid pro quo requests,"" according to the affidavit. And eventually, the agents' relationships with Yee led to the coffeehouse last month, where prosecutors say he introduced the supposed East Coast mobster to a man he said could provide guns and rockets. It had taken more than three months of cajoling and another $6,000 to get to this point, according to the arrest affidavit. The document recounts how Jackson, who served with Yee on the city school board in the 1990s, promised Yee's associate could supply ""cargo containers full of weapons"" from Philippine insurgents. In taking the money, Jackson told the agent that Yee ""fully understood"" the money was for being introduced to arms dealer: ""We just talked about that today,"" the affidavit quotes Jackson as saying. Jackson is accused not only of being Yee's bagman but of taking part in other Chee Kung Tong schemes, including a murder-for-hire plot. But in court papers seeking to continue his release on bail, his attorneys argue that the crimes he's accused of committing ""were all driven by government agents."" ""The government, despite having apparently targeted Mr. Jackson since 2011, has not charged Mr. Jackson with one dangerous offense that was not inspired by a government agent,"" attorney James Brosnahan wrote. ""In short, the government agents created the purported danger that the government now seeks to use to incarcerate Mr. Jackson."" Yee suspected something was up in the weeks before his arrest. In February, he said he believed one of his fellow senators ""was wearing a 'wire' for the FBI.'"" ""Senator Yee attributed his long career in public office to being careful and cautious,"" the arrest affidavit recounts. His partner in that conversation? An FBI agent. A 'sense of entitlement' Yee has been in public office since 1988, when he won a seat on the school board. He moved on from there to the city's Board of Supervisors, then the Assembly and finally, in 2006, to the Senate. The son of immigrants who had brought him from China at age 3, he grew up to attend the University of California at Berkeley and earn a Ph.D. in child psychology from the University of Hawaii. But despite his longevity, Lee was a ""loner,"" Brown said -- and that limited his effectiveness as a legislator. ""That's why it's such a shock to me,"" said Brown, who once endorsed and later fired the aspiring politico. From a ""practical, intellectual standpoint,"" he said, ""You don't bribe or you don't launder money or you don't do things with people who can't deliver on public policy."" The allegations have rattled many in the city, particularly its ethnic Chinese community, said David Lee, the executive director of the Chinese-American Voters Education Committee. ""It's really out of the line of imagination for somebody who is in public service to be trading arms for campaign donations,"" Lee said. But he said the charges against Yee highlight what Lee called the ""arms race"" that campaign finance has become in California, where it can cost millions to run for even a low-level office. ""It also demonstrates the sense of entitlement that many of our elected officials feel they have to hold power,"" he said. Yee ""wanted at all costs to hold onto power, and I think voters are tired of it."" Doreen Silk, a constituent and Yee supporter, said the news of his arrest ""surprised all of us."" ""I mean, he's living in my neighborhood,"" she said. ""We all backed him. It's so surprising."" Silk said she thought his actions were ""an isolated instance"" -- one that may prompt a second look at some other local politicians, ""but I don't think it's an epidemic."" Yee is the third Democrat in the state Senate to face criminal charges in the past year. Rod Wright was found guilty of perjury and fraudulent voting in January after a jury concluded he was living outside his Los Angeles-area district when elected in 2008. Another Southern California senator, Ronald Calderon, was charged with taking bribes from undercover FBI agents in February. Lee called himself a ""lifelong Democrat."" But in the wake of those scandals, he said, Californians ""are watching the Democratic Party in this state and what is going to be done."" He urged Yee to resign and allow his constituents to have an untainted voice in the state Senate. ""What purpose does it serve to stay in that position while all this is going on?"" Lee asked.","California state Sen. Leland Yee pleads not guilty to corruption, arms trafficking .
He's been accused of brokering an arms deal in exchange for campaign donations .
The charges are part of a sprawling Bay Area racketeering case .

"It's a common error, but one that leaves those with an affinity for Latin America shaking their heads: The Andean country known for its coffee and flower exports is Colombia, not Columbia. Now, a group of marketing-savvy Colombians, spurred by the government's public relations arm, have launched a social media campaign to set the record straight. Colombia is where famed artist Fernando Botero hails from; Columbia is a university in New York. The coffee you drank this morning might be from Colombia; Your outerwear might have been made by Columbia. And so on and so on. The campaign is picking up steam ahead of its official unveiling on Wednesday evening during Social Media Week in New York. A Facebook page for the campaign has been gaining upwards of 1,000 followers a day with a flurry of humorous and creative photos bringing attention to the Colombia/Columbia confusion. The campaign is lighthearted, but has a serious mission behind it -- to use the spelling lesson as a door for people to reacquaint themselves with modern Colombia. Organizers hope the effort eventually will parlay into real economic opportunities, be it through tourism or foreign investment. ""People outside of Colombia, especially in the United States, have a wrong impression of what Colombia is,"" said Carlos Pardo, a vice president of Colombia-based Zemoga, a digital services company with many U.S. clients. The South American country's image often is associated with drug lords such as Pablo Escobar and guerrilla violence, and many foreigners remain unaware of the changes that have taken place, Pardo said. Even positive things Colombia is known for -- such as the coffee and flowers mentioned earlier -- do not paint a complete picture, he said. ""Today, Colombia is much more than coffee and Pablo Escobar. More than Shakira even,"" Pardo said. When Zemoga joined forces with public relations firm Compass Porter Novelli to work on a presentation for Social Media Week, the country's own official brand, Marca Pais, asked them to use the platform to promote Colombia. They agreed, and the ""It's Colombia, not Columbia"" campaign was born. It is the first of many pro-Colombia messages that the group will put out. The goal is to have fun with it and create an entry point for foreigners to explore their country, Pardo said. Colombia in recent years has made strides against drug cartels, though the country remains a top supplier of cocaine to illicit markets. The government continues to wage a war against the FARC guerrillas, though the two sides are currently in peace talks for the first time in a decade. The two sides have been at war since the 1960s, and Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos has said he wants talks wrapped up by November.","Group of Colombians have started a campaign to clear up a spelling confusion .

"The opening was so small that CNN's Wolf Blitzer -- no physical giant -- had to bend down to climb inside one of 30 or so Palestinian tunnels from Gaza to southern Israel. ""I guess the tunnel was built for relatively short people, because if you stand up you're going to hit your head,"" Blitzer said of the almost two-mile concrete corridor about 45 feet underground where he reported from Monday. His visit, accompanied by the Israeli military, revealed conditions in the network of tunnels below Gaza that are a key issue in the current violent spasm between Hamas militants in Gaza and Israel. Originally built to avoid Israeli and Egyptian checkpoints into Gaza, the tunnels have been vital supply lines for Palestinians in Gaza. Now the snaking underground routes increasingly get used for attacks in Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu launched a ground assault on Gaza this month intended to destroy the tunnel network, and Blitzer went into one of them so see what it was like. Cooler than the surface . So far down, the tunnel was surprisingly cool inside compared to the hot conditions on the surface, Blitzer noted. Stooped over, he walked along the concrete-encased pathway with wiring visible in some parts. The concrete came from Israel, as did the electric power Palestinians send down for lights in some parts, said Lt. Col. Oshik Azouli, deputy commander of Israel's Southern Gaza Brigade. It took two years or more, progressing a meter or two a day, to extend the tunnel into Israel, according to Azouli. ""It's pretty secure, this concrete,"" Blitzer said. ""They spent a lot of effort building this tunnel."" The tunnel ended near a kibbutz in Israel, Azouli said, adding its purpose was to attack people on the collective agriculture community. Used for attacks . Later Monday, the Palestinian representative to the United States told Blitzer the tunnels originated to get around the blockade of Gaza, but take on another role in conflict. ""Factions in Gaza are utilizing them to target the Israeli military, especially at times of conflict,"" Maen Rashid Areikat said, adding: ""They want to be creative about how to respond to any attacks. and probably also take initiative."" A series of Hamas attacks via tunnels on Israeli soil escalated Israel's response in the current violence. The method of attack, in which militants spring out unexpectedly from underground, has raised fears among Israelis living near Gaza. ""They are a strategic danger,"" Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev said of the tunnels later Monday, telling Blitzer it was ""unacceptable"" to have Hamas attackers ""just pop out of the ground on our side of the frontier to murder and kidnap."" However, Palestinian parliament member Mustafa Barghouti called the tunnels a defensive tactic against repeated Israeli invasions in recent years. ""These tunnels are nothing but a primitive way of trying to defend themselves,"" he told Blitzer. 'Lower Gaza' Israeli military officials refer to the tunnels as ""Lower Gaza."" They aren't new. Hamas used one in 2006 to capture Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit and take him into Gaza. He was held captive for five years until a deal was struck for his release in exchange for more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. During its incursion into Gaza, Israel's military has so far found scores of different access shafts leading to about 30 tunnels. It says it destroyed about half, but expects to find more. Blitzer said Israel wants to remove the tunnels from the equation before agreeing to a cease-fire with Hamas.","Tunnels unacceptable to Israel; a defense tactic to Palestinians .

"Early one eastern Congolese morning six months ago, Josephine was sleeping in her hut, dreaming about selling her crops. She heard people singing victory songs, thinking it was part of her dream, but gunshots jolted her awake. She could see in the light of dawn that the next village was on fire. She saw people fleeing toward her village, some being shot as they ran. She quickly herded her four children into the tall grass, where others from her village were already hiding. They watched their village torched by the singing militia, known as Raia Mutumboki, a branch of which is allied to the M23, the latest rebel group to plunge the Congo into full-scale war. During their first day of hiding, Josephine sent her eldest son, Emmanuel, back to the village to get food from their storehouse. He was discovered and shot. The militia began to hunt the villagers in the tall grass, again singing victory songs, using hoes and machetes to kill whomever they caught. The survivors walked for days to a displaced persons camp, where Josephine's second son, Avarino, died of malaria. ""I can't understand how human beings can treat other human beings this way,"" Josephine said. This story echoes what so many have suffered through during 16 years of eastern Congo's war, the deadliest since World War II, nearly 70 years ago, with about 6.9 million deaths, based on a New York Times estimate in 2010. On Sunday, the Democratic Republic of Congo and other African states are due to sign a framework agreement that aims to build a foundation for regional peace. That so many African states -- along with the United Nations, African Union, European Union and United States -- are uniting in an effort to address the roots of conflict in Congo is an encouraging development. The signing of this framework deal doesn't end the war in Congo, but rather it provides a starting point for a global effort to try to end finally the world's deadliest conflict. Four important changes are under way in Congo today, giving this initiative a better chance than its predecessors. First, for decades all of the benefits of eastern Congo's vast mineral resource wealth have gone to those with the biggest guns -- the Congolese army, local militias or neighboring countries. These minerals include, among others, gold, cobalt, copper, tin, industrial diamonds and coltan, used in cell phones, laptops and other electronic devices. But U.S. and European consumer demands for a conflict-free minerals trade, congressional legislation, International Monetary Fund aid suspensions, U.N. experts' reports, responsible investors and other influential voices are making it harder to profit violently and illegally from mineral smuggling. Second, regional support for armed groups inside eastern Congo has been a staple of the ongoing cycle of war there for years. For the first time, the international community is imposing meaningful consequences for evidence of cross-border weapons supply. Rwanda strenuously denies involvement, but some donors have suspended aid programs to that nation and will continue to do so until the evidence shifts toward solutions. Third, until recently, accountability for war crimes wasn't part of the discussion despite some of the worst crimes against humanity being committed globally since World War II. But calls for international justice have intensified inside Congo and beyond, and accused war criminals are beginning to face sanctions. Fourth, calls for the reform of a U.N. peacekeeping mission that costs more than $1 billion are increasing. Refocusing the mission on eradicating the worst armed groups, demobilizing rank-and-file combatants and helping to reform Congo's army would go much further than the present mandate. Africa has pledged 4,000 new combat troops to deal with the worst militias, and change can start with them. When I asked Josephine why all this was happening, she replied, ""The war is over the minerals, nothing else."" Although some would say that is oversimplified, it is undeniable that a major tipping point is approaching. If the commercial incentives for the massively profitable minerals trade can be shifted from violent, illegal extraction to peaceful, legal development, Congo could enjoy a transition similar to those experienced by West African countries plagued by blood diamond wars a decade ago. A soon-to-be-named U.N. ""super envoy"" should help construct a comprehensive peace process for Congo and its neighbors, building on the upcoming framework. With his history of concern over Congo, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry could be helpful in this. Two tracks seem necessary. One would involve an impartially facilitated national dialogue to address internal Congolese issues such as army and justice reform, decentralization, electoral frameworks, immigration, minority protections, land dispute adjudication, mining codes and other divisive issues. The other would be a regional process in which Congo and its neighbors could address shared security threats and negotiate cooperative investment and infrastructure arrangements that could ignite a real economic boom for Central Africa. ""People around the world should do all they can to stop those instigating war in my country,"" Josephine told me. ""That is the only way we can be at peace. If I hear my village is at peace, I will drop everything and go home with my children."" Given the history of international looting of Congo's resources, we should help give Josephine -- and Congo -- that chance.","Congo war, funded by conflict minerals, is the deadliest since World War II .

"It's a dot in the sky. But not just any dot. For the Curiosity rover, it's home. NASA tweeted a photo Thursday taken by Curiosity from the Mars surface six days earlier. The image shows a speck above the horizon that a pointer identifies as Earth. ""Look Back in Wonder,"" reads the accompanying text from the Curiosity Rover's official Twitter feed. ""My 1st picture of Earth from the surface of Mars."" If it's possible for a 1-ton, roughly SUV-size vehicle to get homesick, it's had plenty of reason to shed a tear. The last time Curiosity was on Earth was November 26, 2011, when it set off aboard a NASA spacecraft from Cape Canaveral, Florida. NASA launches Mars rover . Eight and a half months and some 352 million miles later, the rover landed safely on Mars with its 17 cameras and other assorted scientific instruments all intact. And almost as quickly, the Curiosity -- the centerpiece of a $2.6 billion project -- began transmitting images back to Earth. But until now, none of those pictures actually showed Earth itself. The one released by NASA, which was ""processed to remove effects of cosmic rays,"" was taken about 80 minutes after Mars' sunset with what researchers call Curiosity's ""left eye camera"" on its ""Mastcam."" It shows not just Earth but another dot that NASA says is our moon. (Earth was about 99 million miles away at that point, according to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Curiosity traveled a much longer distance to get to Mars because both planets are constantly in motion.) Any Martian or Earthling who happened to be visiting wouldn't need such a special camera to see the same thing. According to NASA, ""A human observer with normal vision, if standing on Mars, could easily see Earth and the moon as two distinct, bright 'evening stars.'"" Of course, photographing its native planet isn't Curiosity's main mission, which is exploring Mars. Since landing in Gale Crater, Curiosity has helped scientists determine that an area called Yellowknife Bay was habitable in ancient times. Here, from the rim of the crater came stream waters that formed ""a lake-stream-groundwater system that might have existed for millions of years,"" John Grotzinger, lead scientist on the Curiosity mission, wrote in last month's edition of the journal Science.

"When it comes to Iran and the West, the relationship has been convoluted for decades. And this deal is no different. After days of negotiations, six world powers and Tehran reached an agreement that calls on Iran to limit its nuclear activities in return for lighter sanctions. It's complicated politics coupled with complicated science. Here's a quick primer to get you up to speed. How did Iran's nuclear program start? The United States launched a nuclear program with Iran in 1957. Back then, the Shah ruled Iran and the two countries were still friends. With backing from the United States, Iran started developing its nuclear power program in the 1970s. But the U.S. pulled its support when the Shah was overthrown during the Islamic Revolution in 1979. Who are these 'six world powers'? The talks involved the P5+1 group comprising diplomats from the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council: U.S., UK, France, Russia and China, plus Germany -- and of course Iran. The group has been meeting in Geneva for days in hopes of reaching a diplomatic solution. Read the deal (.PDF) Is Iran the only nation with a nuclear program? No. Eight nations are known to have nuclear weapons, including all the P5 countries. Nearby Israel has always declined to confirm whether it has any, although the Federation of American Scientists estimates it has about 80 atomic weapons. But since the 1979 revolution, concerns have escalated that Iran could enrich uranium and make atomic weapons. Iran has maintained its nuclear program is only for peaceful purposes. Why have the other nations not faced as much scrutiny? For nations such as India and Pakistan, no action was taken partly because they never signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. ""There was very little that the U.S. could've done to stop Pakistan,"" says Mark Hibbs, a nuclear policy expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Iran, on the other hand, signed the treaty.  And as a result, its program was put under the spotlight. In addition, the International Atomic Energy Agency had information suggesting Iran conducted activities it hasn't declared in the past. Fareed Zakaria: What critics are getting wrong about the Iran deal . Why is Iran's nuclear program considered such a threat? Since its revolution, the West has worried Iran could use its nuclear program to produce atomic weapons using highly-enriched uranium. A decade ago, nuclear inspectors from the international agency announced they had found traces of highly-enriched uranium at a plant in Natanz. Iran temporarily halted enrichment, but resumed enriching again in 2006, insisting enrichment was allowed under its agreement with the IAEA. Enough with the background. Let's talk about the deal  that was reached. It's more of an interim agreement before the deal. Described as an initial, six-month deal, the White House says it includes ""substantial limitations that will help prevent Iran from creating a nuclear weapon."" In short, it slows the country's nuclear development program in exchange for lifting some sanctions while a more formal agreement is worked out. It's not permanent, so why is it a big deal? For years, Iran and Western powers have left negotiating tables in disagreement, frustration and open animosity. But the diplomatic tone changed after Iran's election this year, which saw President Hassan Rouhani take over.  ""For the first time in nearly a decade, we have halted the progress of the Iranian nuclear program,"" U.S. President Barack Obama says. What about the stockpiles Iran already has? As part of the deal, Iran will be required to dilute its stockpile of uranium that had been enriched to 20%. While uranium isn't bomb-grade until it's enriched to 90% purity, ""once you're at 20%, you're about 80% of the way there,"" Hibbs says. The deal also mandates Iran halt all enrichment above 5% and dismantle the technical equipment required to do that. Before the end of the initial phase of the deal, all its stockpiles should be diluted below 5% or converted to a form not suitable for further enrichment, the deal states. Breaking down the deal . Why 5%? Iran consistently says it's enriching uranium and building nuclear reactors only for peaceful civilian energy needs. Nuclear power plants use uranium that is enriched to 5%. It's the fuel that the plants use to generate electricity. What else will Iran have to do? Iran would also have to cut back on constructing new centrifuges and enrichment facilities, and freeze essential work on its heavy-water reactor under development at Arak. That facility could be used as a source of plutonium -- a second pathway to a nuclear bomb. The reactor under construction southwest of Tehran had been a sticking point in earlier negotiations. What's a centrifuge? It's a mechanism used to enrich uranium. How will we know Iran is living up to its end of the deal? Iran is expected to provide daily access to inspectors from the international agency, IAEA. The inspectors will be expected to visit centrifuge assembly and storage facilities, uranium mills and the Arak reactor, among others. The P5+1 and Iran will also form a joint task force on the issue. What if it doesn't fulfill its commitment? The international community will add more sanctions -- and pressure. One agreement, wildly different reactions . What's in it for Iran? Billions of dollars. As part of preliminary steps, the world powers involved in the talks will provide ""limited, temporary, targeted, and reversible relief to Iran."" The deal calls for no new nuclear-related sanctions in the six-month period if Iran keeps its end of the bargain. The world powers will also suspend sanctions on various items, including gold and petrochemical exports. That suspension will provide Iran with about $1.5 billion in revenue, according to the White House. Sanctions relief will also target other areas, including government funds from restricted Iranian accounts for its students in other countries. But the White House says the $7 billion in total relief is just a small fraction. ""The vast majority of Iran's approximately $100 billion in foreign exchange holdings are inaccessible or restricted by sanctions,"" it says. What's not in the deal? A better deal would have included Iranians shipping out their highly enriched uranium to be converted elsewhere, says Aaron David Miller, vice president of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. ""It would have been better ... if Iran had much more of their nuclear infrastructure put out of use. But that's the deal they got."" How did the sanctions come to be? Seven years ago, the U.N. Security Council passed sanctions against Iran for failing to suspend its nuclear program. Sanctions that initially targeted Iran's nuclear capability expanded to include bans on arms sales, Iranian oil and certain financial institutions, including the country's central bank. This has crippled its economy and made Iran a pariah in the international community. Oil revenues have plummeted, and the local currency had dropped 80% in value by 2012. Iranians have faced spiraling inflation and  layoffs. Opinion: Iran deal a risk worth taking . Why isn't Israel applauding the deal? The two nearby countries and archrivals have been at each other's throats for years. Israel says it has the most to lose if Iran develops a nuclear bomb. It has repeatedly warned the West to tread warily when dealing with Tehran. And Israeli lawmakers are not happy that their greatest ally, the United States, has disregarded their warning and struck an interim deal with Iran. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the agreement a ""historic mistake"" that his country isn't bound by. So much tension between Iran and Israel, why? It wasn't always this way. After the birth of Israel in 1948, the two nations enjoyed a ""honeymoon"" that lasted until just before the 1979 revolution, says David Menashri, professor emeritus of Tel Aviv University. Israel even supplied weapons to Iran to help it fight their common enemy, Iraq. But the Islamic revolution that overthrew the Shah marked a turning point. The Islamic republic, led by Shiite clerics in the predominantly Shiite nation, saw Israel as an illegitimate state with no right to exist, certainly not amid Muslim nations. Years later, Israel began to regard Iran and its support of global terror as a chief threat. Those concerns escalated when international inspectors found traces of highly enriched uranium at a power plant in Iran. Kerry: Israel is safe under new deal . Who else is unhappy? Saudi Arabia. It's a majority Sunni country. Iran is majority Shiite. Saudi Arabia, like Israel, is troubled by Iran's growing clout in the Middle East. ""The Saudi government has been very concerned about these negotiations with Iran and unhappy at the prospect of a deal with Iran,"" a Saudi government official who is not authorized to speak to the media told CNN. So, will this interim deal work? There are no perfect agreements. And the success of any interim deal will be measured ""in months and years, not in minutes,"" says Karim Sadjadpour of the Carnegie Endowment. Whether Iran is serious about mothballing its nuclear ambitions remains to be seen. There may be sizable obstacles that aren't yet apparent. There are certainly aspects where the deal stopped short. For now, Miller says, don't break open the champagne bottles just yet. President Obama's legacy moment on Iran .","U.S. pulled support of Iran's nuclear program during Islamic Revolution .

Edward Archbold died ""as a result of asphyxia due to choking and aspiration of gastric contents,"" said the Broward County Medical Examiner's Office. It said his airway was obstructed by bug body parts, and ruled his death was an accident. Archbold was among 20 to 30 contestants participating in the ""Midnight Madness"" event at Ben Siegel Reptiles in Deerfield Beach. The participant who consumed the most insects and worms would take home an $850 python. Archbold swallowed roach after roach, worm after worm. While the store didn't say exactly how many Archbold consumed, the owner told CNN affiliate WPLG that he was ""the life of the party."" Soon after the contest was over, Archbold fell ill and began to vomit, the Broward County Sheriff's Office said. A friend called for medical help. Then, Archbold himself dialed 911, the store said in a Facebook post. Eventually, he fell to the ground outside the store, the sheriff's office said.

"(CNN)  -- A Malaysian model, who is set to become the first woman in the Southeast Asian country to be caned for drinking alcohol in public, wants her punishment carried out in public. Kartika Sari Dewi Shukarno says that if a caning is meant to teach a lesson, then it should be in public. Kartika Sari Dewi Shukarno said Thursday that if the intent of the Islamic, or Shariah, court that sentenced her was to set an example for other Muslims, then the flogging should take place in the open. ""Let's be transparent about it,"" she said. ""We want to challenge them,"" added Kartika's father, Shukarno Abdul Muttalib. ""The law is a little bit wrong. They say they are gentlemen who want to uphold values. Then the public should judge how gentlemanly it is."" An Islamic court in the eastern state of Pahang fined Kartika $1,400 (5,000 Malaysian ringgit) and sentenced her to six strokes with a rattan cane for drinking beer at a hotel bar two years ago. Kartika, a 32-year-old part-time model, was visiting Malaysia from Singapore, where she lives with her husband and two children. She pleaded guilty and has paid the fine. Malaysia, which considers itself a moderate Muslim country, forbids alcohol consumption by Muslims -- even those who are visiting. The country has a dual-track justice system, in which Islamic courts operate alongside civil ones. The law forbidding alcohol applies only to Muslims, who make up about 60 percent of the population. The country's Buddhist, Christian or Hindu population can drink freely. Kartika's case has caused an uproar, with many citing it as another example of growing fundamentalism in the multiracial country. In northern Malaysia's Kelantan state, authorities have forbidden Muslim women from wearing bright lipstick and noisy, high-heeled shoes, saying the ban will safeguard the morals and dignity of the women, as well as thwart rape. ""We want to present a face to the world that we are not a fundamentalist country,"" Ashli Chin, said a resident in Kuala Lumpur. ""This makes us a laughingstock."" Mohamad Isa Abd Ralip, president of the Syariah [Shariah] Lawyers' Association of Malaysia, said too much is being made of Kartika's punishment. ""It is not about causing pain. It is about educating others and to teach the person a lesson,"" he said. The recipient is fully clothed and the flogger cannot raise his arm high, Mohamad Isa said. The blows are delivered using a thin stick, so that they don't break the skin. Malaysia's civil court does not call for caning for alcohol consumption. It also cannot overrule a Shariah court sentence. The civil courts do, however, hand out flogging sentences for serious offenses such as rape. Neighboring Singapore also metes out caning as punishment. One of the most notable cases was that of American teenager Michael Fay, who received four strokes for vandalism in 1994. Kartika's punishment is unique because she has opted to go through with it, which would make her the first woman to be caned for drinking alcohol in public, Mohamad Isa said. Two other Malaysians sentenced to the same fate have filed appeals. Kartika will be taken from her father's house Monday. The caning will be carried out within seven days after that. ""I'm not really afraid. I feel relief,"" she said. ""I want to move on. This case has been hanging over me for a long time.""","Woman set to be first woman to be caned in Malaysia for drinking in public .

"My military minder tells me to turn my camera off, and it soon becomes clear why. The poverty I see through the bus window is not the view of North Korea the regime wants to be seen. We are traveling from Hyangsan, three hours north of Pyongyang, back to the capital, but the main road and the sanctioned route has been flooded. This is the only way back. Buildings are in disrepair; some barely look inhabitable. Residents of this small town walk or sit by the side of the road, many seeming to have little to do.  A number of official-looking men dressed in brown Mao suits stand silently on street corners. It is impossible to know who they are or which element of the party or military they might work for, but they clearly seem to be observing. A sneak peek through the keyhole . Despite the driver traveling as quickly as possible through these inhabited areas, you could still sense the local community being monitored. Dozens of men are working on the outskirts of town, building a stone wall between their crops and the swollen river. Boulders and stones are carried by hand and stacked without adhesive. This intensive labor force is seen repeatedly in the North Korean countryside, but I see no heavy equipment to help building or farming. One man trims hedges with a rusty scythe; other men repair part of the pavement with small hand-held pickaxes. Cars are rare; most people either walk or cycle. Surviving the streets of North Korea . Back in the countryside, I am surprised by how much land has been farmed. The United Nations says a quarter of the country's children are severely malnourished, and yet as far as the eye can see are fields of maize, rice, wheat and corn. In the midst of the Korean rainy season, the landscape is lush, and it raises the question of how this food, once harvested, is distributed. While driving to Hyangsan, an area the regime wants to see tourists flock to, we're stopped at a number of military checkpoints. Each time, we are told we cannot go on as the roads are flooded, but each time, our minders talk us through until it becomes clear there has been significant damage. One side of a dual carriageway has completely collapsed 20 feet into the river below. Two soldiers sit on their bikes and look on helplessly. This is considered one of the main roads in North Korea, but the damage caused could take months to fix, according to a military official accompanying us. The town of Hyangsan is filled with bunting and posters for the celebration of the 60th anniversary of the Korean War, a day North Korea calls ""Victory Day."" Women crouch by the side of the road clearing the grass of weeds; others sweep the streets with a tree branch. Celebrations clearly extend far beyond the capital city. The landscape itself is stunning. Lush mountains rise from the fog covered river, a river that feeds the local community. One small boy fishes using a crudely made net, walking backward through the shallows, dragging the small net attached to a piece of wood in the hope of catching something. Nearby, a family washes their clothes in the river, suggesting running water is a luxury in this region. The hotel we are staying in has an intermittent supply. Farther downstream, a man has brought soap to the water's edge to wash his hair and his clothing.  A security official appears from nowhere to stop me filming. I see two different North Koreas on this trip: the sanctioned tourist view of the beautifully groomed gardens of the Pohyon Buddhist temple, with their perfectly preserved shrines. And the poorer view I see flashing by the bus window.","CNN's Paula Hancocks experienced a rare trip through North Korea's interior .

"(CNN)Most Indian cities are busy with cluttered streets, winding and hidden alleyways -- every postman's nightmare. Informal structures stand side by side with formal ones making navigation challenging -- even for locals -- and these cities are only going to keep sprawling, fast. By some estimates, the country's urban population alone will surpass 500-million by 2030: almost double the entire population of the US. Zippr's Aditya Vuchi hopes to fix the broken postal format in India's exploding economy. CNN: Why do you think India needs a service like Zippr? Aditya Vuchi: Newer localities, newer cities are now coming up much faster than even the postal department is able to keep up with. As a result, large parts of India today don't have structured addresses. CNN: There are often no building numbers or street names. How will Zippr tackle this? AV: It solves the problem of explaining your address in a complicated way. We have mobile applications -- Android and IOS -- as well as on the web, where you go on to the app. Point on your map where your home or office is, give all your address information one time including landmarks, and the system generates a Zippr code. That short 8-character unique code can then be shared with others, taking users to an exact location on Google Maps with directions. CNN: More than 80 per cent of India's population still lives in an offline world of SMS messages and phone calls. How will Zippr reach these potential customers? AV: Going forward, we're going to enable finding out an address via SMS channels where you text a Zippr code to a number and get an automatic response back with the full address, as well as directions to get there. CNN: How many people do you think the service has the scope to reach? AV: The vision that we are chasing at Zippr is to impact a billion lives.

"(CNN)  -- A pregnant British woman jailed in Laos was denied access to a British lawyer who flew out to meet her, a human rights group said Tuesday. Samantha Orobator became pregnant in prison, according to a spokeswoman for rights group Reprieve. Samantha Orobator, 20, had been facing possible execution by firing squad after she was arrested in August for allegedly carrying about half a kilogram of heroin. Those found guilty of carrying that amount normally face the death penalty, said the lawyer, Anna Morris of Reprieve, a London-based human rights group. But Orobator will escape the death sentence because she is pregnant, a spokesman for the Laotian Foreign Ministry said Tuesday. The country's criminal law prohibits courts from sentencing pregnant women to death, spokesman Khenthong Nuanthasing told CNN. The woman's trial hasn't been scheduled yet, he said, but is likely to happen next week. Morris went to Laos on Sunday, having been assured she would be able to meet Orobator, Reprieve said. But so far, she has been refused permission, the group said.  Watch a report on the case » . ""Ms. Morris was refused her first visit yesterday, and I am led to understand that the Laotians are now saying that she will not be permitted to visit. This is totally unacceptable,"" Reprieve director Clive Stafford Smith said in an open letter to British Foreign Secretary David Miliband. Orobator has not seen a lawyer since she was arrested August 5, allegedly with just over half a kilogram (about a pound) of heroin, according to Reprieve. That amount of heroin would sell for $80,000 to $150,000 on the streets of New York, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration said. London's Metropolitan Police declined to estimate a street value.  Watch a former Laos prison inmate recount jail conditions » . Reprieve has said that Orobator became pregnant in prison, possibly as a result of rape, and that she is due to give birth in September. That would mean Orobator became pregnant in January. Khenthong agreed that Orobator is five months pregnant. But he indicated that Orobator might have already been pregnant when she was arrested, and that she lost the first baby while in prison. He said Orobator declared on the day of her arrest in August that she was two months pregnant by her boyfriend. After she had already been in jail for some time, he said, Orobator asked for medication to cure a vaginal infection, and he believes it caused her to lose the child. Khenthong said officials are investigating Orobator's pregnancy. Orobator's mother said she found out about her daughter's pregnancy in January. Jane Orobator told CNN she heard the news from the British Foreign Office, which has been monitoring the case. There is no British Embassy in Laos; a British vice consul arrived in the country over the weekend, the British Foreign Office said. Jane Orobator said she cannot believe her daughter was involved in drug trafficking, and she was surprised to learn she was in Laos. ""I don't know"" what she was doing there, she said from her home in Dublin, Ireland. ""The last time she spoke with me, she said she was on holiday in London and she would come to see us in Dublin before returning to the UK in July. ""She is not the type of person who would be involved in drugs,"" she added. Reprieve is worried about her health, especially given her pregnancy, Morris said. ""She became pregnant in prison. We are concerned that it may not have been consensual, and we are concerned that someone who finds herself in prison at 20 is subject to exploitation,"" she said. ""I am the first British lawyer who has asked for access to her,"" Morris said. ""She needs to have a local lawyer appointed to her. We are pressing very hard for the local authorities to appoint one."" She said it was normal in the Laotian justice system for a defendant to get a lawyer only days before a trial. The last execution in Laos was in 1990, the foreign affairs spokesman said. Samantha Orobator was born in Nigeria and moved to London with her family when she was 8, her mother said.

"A transgender first-grader who was born a boy but identifies as a girl has won the right to use the girls' restroom at her Colorado school. The Colorado Rights Division ruled in favor of Coy Mathis in her fight against the Fountain-Fort Carson School District. Coy's parents had taken her case to the commission after the district said she could no longer use the girls' bathroom at Eagleside Elementary. In issuing its decision, the state's rights division said keeping the ban in place ""creates an environment that is objectively and subjectively hostile, intimidating or offensive."" The Transgender Legal Defense & Education Fund praised the ruling that was filled under Colorado's Anti-Discrimination Act. Michael Silverman, the group's executive director, called the ruling ""a high-water mark for transgender rights."" This is the first of it's kind ruling in the country regarding the rights of transgender students. No court, no tribunal has ever said what the Colorado Division of Civil Rights has said today which is that trangendered students must be treated equally. They specifically referenced the outmoded concept of separate but equal and told us that separate but equal is very rarely equal and it is certainly not equal in Coy's case. Coy's mother, Kathryn Mathis, said she's pleased that Coy can return to school and put this behind her. The first-grader has been home schooled during the proceedings . ""We're very thrilled that Coy is able to return to school and have the same rights that all the other girls had, that she should have had and was afforded by law to begin with. We're extremely happy that she's going to be treated equally and we thank the civil rights division for coming to this conclusion,"" Kathryn Mathis said. ""We're very grateful to the voters of Colorado for putting its laws into place to begin with."" A girl's life . For most of the past year, Coy has dressed as a girl. Coy's passport and state-issued identification recognize her as female. Transgender kids: Painful quest to be who they are . Mathis said she got a call ""out of the blue"" from the school in December saying that Coy could use the boys' bathroom, gender-neutral faculty bathrooms or the nurse's bathroom, but not the girls' facilities. The district ""took into account not only Coy, but other students in the building, their parents and the future impact a boy with male genitals using a girls' bathroom would have as Coy grew older,"" a letter the family's attorney received in December said. ""However, I'm certain you can appreciate that, as Coy grows older and his male genitals develop along with the rest of his body, at least some parents and students are likely to become uncomfortable with his continued use of the girls' restroom."" CNN was unable to reach the school district early Monday for comment on the ruling. But in February, the district's attorney, W. Kelly Dude, said: ""The district firmly believes it has acted reasonably and fairly with respect to this issue."" Opinion: Gender identity not just body parts . A little-studied group . Transgender children experience a disconnect between their sex, which is based on their anatomy, and their gender, which includes behaviors, roles and activities, experts say. For the general public, transgender identity may be a new concept, though many might recall Chaz Bono, the child of entertainers Sonny and Cher. Born female, Bono underwent a transition in his 40s to become a man. He wrote in his book ""Transition"" that, even as a child, he had been ""aware of a part of me that did not fit."" He appeared last year as a man on ""Dancing with the Stars,"" in part, he said, to destigmatize being transgender. Being transgender no longer a mental 'disorder' in diagnostic manual . Comprehensive data and studies about transgender children are rare. International studies have estimated that anywhere from 1 in 30,000 to 1 in 1,000 people are transgender. Some children as young as age 3 show early signs of gender dysphoria or gender identity disorder, mental health experts who work with transgender children say. These children are not intersex -- they do not have a physical disorder or malformation of their sexual organs. The gender issue exists in the brain, though experts do not agree on whether it's psychologically or physiologically based. Many transgender people report feeling discomfort with their gender as early as they can remember. Transgender job seekers face uphill battle . Gender identity is often confused with sexual orientation. The difference is that ""gender identity is who you are, and sexual orientation is who you want to have sex with,"" said Dr. Johanna Olson, a professor of clinical pediatrics at the University of Southern California, who treats transgender children. Children around age 3 are probably not interested in sexual orientation, she said. But experts say some children who look like they will be transgender in early childhood turn out to be gay, lesbian or bisexual. Differences in schools . School policies toward transgender students vary across the United States. In New York, for example, the law says students can't be discriminated against on the basis of their gender identity. But in Maine, a court ruled in November that a school district did not violate a transgender student's rights when she was told she couldn't use the girls' bathroom. Gender nonconformity is not a disorder, group says . Dude, the Colorado school district's attorney, has said there is nothing in that state requiring public schools to permit transgender students to use restrooms intended for the gender with which they identify. At the time, he argued that the Fountain-Fort Carson School District adheres to the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act in all respects: ""Coy attends class as all other students, is permitted to wear girls' clothes and is referred to as the parents have requested."" On Monday, Silverman underscored what he described as the unfairness of Coy's situation. ""By denying Coy the right to use the little girls restroom like all the other little girls at school it had created an environment that was hostile, discriminatory and unsafe. Coy was treated in what was referred to as an exceptional way, which limited her educational opportunities. In the end, we've been saying from the start, that Coy wants the same dignity, respect and opportunity, and deserves that, as every other student in Colorado. The state of Colorado has now said that's exactly what she deserves,"" Silverman said.

"COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (CNN) -- Sri Lanka's government said Monday its forces had killed Tamil rebel chief Velupillai Prabhakaran as he attempted to flee, according to the country's state-run news agency. The Sri Lankan government says Tamil chief Velupillai Prabhakaran is dead. The Tamil rebel group, formally known as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), is aware of the government's report but has yet to confirm Prabhakaran's death or the deaths of its other leaders, according to a posting on the pro-rebel Web site, Tamilnet.com. It said ""initial reports indicate a determined massacre by the Sri Lanka Army."" Prabhakaran was one of 19 senior LTTE leaders that the government has identified among the bodies found as its troops completed mop-up operations after routing the Tigers, the defense ministry said. The leaders include Prabhakaran's eldest son, Charles Anthony, as well as Pottu Amman, LTTE's intelligence leader, according to the ministry. Prabhakaran founded the rebel group, which has been declared a terrorist organization by 32 countries. It pioneered the use of women in suicide attacks and, according to the FBI, invented the explosive suicide belt. It was also behind the assassination of two world leaders -- the only terrorist organization to do so.  Watch more on the possible end of fighting » . Prabhakaran is accused of masterminding the killing of former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991 in the Tamil-dominated Indian state of Tami Nadu as he campaigned for a second term. Sri Lankan authorities allege that Prabhakaran was avenging Gandhi's decision to send Indian peacekeepers to Sri Lanka. Two years later a Tigers suicide bomber, allegedly acting under Prabhakaran's orders, detonated explosives that killed Sri Lanka's then-president, Ranasinghe Premadasa, during a rally. Over the weekend, the militants offered to ""silence"" their guns after an intense military offensive decimated their ranks, pushed them from their stronghold in the north and east of the country, and cornered the remaining rebels on a small stretch of land. If the rebels honor their pledge, it would potentially mark the end of the longest-running civil war in Asia. Prabhakaran's supporters considered him a hero with a single-minded focus -- to fight for the rights of his people. The Sri Lankan government deemed him a war criminal with a disregard for civilian casualties. He was wanted by Interpol on charges including terrorism and organized crime. In the past it has been reported he wore a cyanide capsule around his neck -- to swallow and kill himself rather than risk capture. And he reportedly expected the same dedication from his troops. As a result, few Tigers have been captured alive. Sri Lanka's President Mahinda Rajapaksa is expected to announce that ""military operations"" against the Tiger rebels have ended in an address to parliament and country on Tuesday.

"If the first thing you've ever heard about black Jews in Israel came out of the mouth — allegedly, still, for now — of L.A. Clippers owner Donald Sterling, I'm sorry to hear that. The reported rambling of an octogenarian billionaire in what sounds like a bedroom fight with his 30-something mistress probably isn't the best source for dissecting geopolitical religiosity. ""You go to Israel, the blacks are just treated like dogs,"" the Guy Who Sounds Like Sterling said on the recording leaked by Somebody Perhaps His Mistress. Here's the full exchange:The Guy: ""It's the world! You go to Israel, the blacks are just treated like dogs.""The Mistress: ""So do you have to treat them like that, too?""Guy: ""The white Jews, there's white Jews and black Jews. Do you understand?""Mistress: ""And are the black Jews less than the white Jews?""Guy: ""A hundred percent, fifty, a hundred percent."" On the surface, Sterling might have a point — even if no one can make any sense of where he was going with it — that dark-skinned Jews have experienced adversity in the Jewish state. But to say ''dogs"" isn't quite kosher. Israel touts with pride successes like Operation Solomon, its airlift of Ethiopian Jews in 1991 — where in one push, more than 14,000 were transported to Israel over 36 hours — to escape persecution in a homeland where the religion has been practiced since Biblical times. There's no question that life, especially the fact that they are alive, is better in the Promised Land. Yet it hasn't been overflowing with milk and honey. Ethiopian Jews are among the poorest Israelis, with 72% living below the poverty line and unemployment affecting as many as six in 10 Ethiopian men and three-quarters of women, according to the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Boston. Consider also that many came from villages without electricity or running water, and that 70% were functionally illiterate in their native Amharic and never learned to read or write Hebrew. It's obvious they'd have trouble integrating into an industrialized society. Frustrations boiled over two years ago in the city of Kiryat Malachi, when thousands demonstrated against discriminatory practices, including apartment owners who refused to rent to Ethiopian Israelis. That's bad. But dogs? ""That's insane. That's disgusting,"" said Avishai Mekonen, an Ethiopian Israeli filmmaker living in New York. ""Basically, this man is stupid. He doesn't know any history of African people,"" said Mekonen, who in his film ""400 Miles to Freedom"" documented his own harrowing escape from Ethiopia as a child, getting separated from his family and nearly dying in the desert. The other side of the Ethiopian Jewish story counts successes like members of the Knesset, writers and musicians, and Yityish Aynaw, the current Miss Israel. While acknowledging that assimilation and rejection are real, Mekonen said: ""There's a lot of change from what happened in the '80s. We had the issue of language and communication and culture. They see us as different, but year-by-year, it's improved."" That's because the community isn't just sitting there taking it, he says. ""They don't give up. They're doing something. We have a voice."" If it's necessary to prove Sterling wrong (requisite disclaimer again: assuming it's him), Mekonen's message of empowerment flies in the face of the repeated theme on the tape that the world is racist and there's nothing you can do about it. ""It isn't a question. We don't evaluate what's right and wrong. We live in a society. We live in a culture. We have to live within that culture,"" the guy in the recording says to sum up his black Jew narrative — which, by the way, isn't clear about who he's referring to. ""Which people is he talking about when he says 'black Jews?'"" asked Mekonen. ""That could be people from North Africa, Asia, India, Israeli Arabs""— all with very different cultures. Shocking.

"(CNN) -- Lessons learned from previous successful airliner ditchings helped pilot C.B. ""Sully"" Sullenberger save 155 lives when he put his US Airways A320 jetliner down in the Hudson River, a fellow pilot told CNN. An Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 767 is seen just before it crashes into the sea off the Comoro Islands in 1996. Twenty-three people died when an Overseas National Airways DC-9 ditched off the Caribbean island of St. Croix in 1970, and 123 were killed in the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 767 off the Comoro Islands near Africa in 1996. But Emilio Corsetti, an Airbus 320 pilot and aviation author, said those ditchings were actually successful ""because people were able to get out"" -- 40 in the 1970 crash and 52 in the 1996 incident. More may have survived if those planes were equipped like the Airbus 320 and if passengers followed standard evacuation procedures, Corsetti told CNN.  Watch how to survive a plane crash » . In fact, Corsetti said, the 1970 crash helped lead to a redesign of seat belts. The belts aboard the DC-9 were ""metal-to-fabric,"" Corsetti said, depending upon tension to keep passengers strapped in their seats. ""Those things gave out... People were thrown out of their seats 10 rows up,"" said Corsetti, who has written a book, ""35 Miles from Shore,"" about the 1970 crash. On the Hudson River on Thursday, the impact was like ""being inside a car that crashes,"" passenger Alberto Panero said. Corsetti also said that the DC-9 didn't have life raft capacity for all those aboard. Unlike the A320's escape slides, which helped dozens of passengers get out, the DC-9s rafts could hold only three or four. In the 1996 crash, the Ethiopian Airlines 767 was attempting a water landing off the Grand Comoro Island during a hijacking. The plane had run out of fuel. While it is uncertain whether there was a struggle in the cockpit, video shows the 767 nearing the ocean's surface. As it does, the plane's left engine hits a reef, Corsetti said, sending it into a cartwheel. He said the majority of the 123 who died drowned. They had put on life vests and inflated them before they could get out of the splintered fuselage, he said, and were trapped against the bulkheads as water filled the wreckage. Sullenberger had other advantages, too, Corsetti said. Putting the jetliner down into the placid Hudson River probably helped him keep the plane level. The DC-9 pilot faced 8- to 15-foot seas in the 1970 ditching and the Ethiopian jet was dealing with offshore waves.  Watch a pilot describe how plane went down » . The A320 also is equipped with a ditching button, Corsetti said, which closes all valves below the waterline, enabling it to float more easily. No matter the lessons learned from the earlier crashes, US Airways passengers were happy Sullenberger was in the cockpit Thursday. ""He's the man! He's absolutely the man!"" passenger Vince Spera said. ""If you want to talk to a hero, get a hold of him because that is the hero in this whole deal.""

"(CNN) -- I am a 54-year-old black woman -- a mother, lawyer and law professor. I teach at the Washington University in St. Louis Law School and live 12 miles away from Ferguson, Missouri. The median household income in my suburb is $85,000 per year. In Ferguson, it is $36,000. In my suburb, 3.5% of the people are black. In Ferguson, almost 70% are black. These are stark contrasts. Yet I share things in common with black people in Ferguson and, indeed, throughout the United States. When I shop, I'm often either ignored as a waste of time or scrutinized as a potential shoplifter. In June, my daughter and I walked into the china and crystal department at a Macy's department store. I was about to speak to the salesperson directly in front of me. She walked right past me to welcome the white woman behind us. My daughter looked at me and said: ""Really? Did she just ignore us?"" My daughter is a young teenager at the crossroads of ""skin color doesn't matter"" and ""oh yes, it does."" She is in transition. I felt hurt, anger and embarrassment. But this kind of encounter happens routinely. Driving, I tend to have a bit of a lead foot -- hitting 45 in a 35 mph zone. The few times I have been stopped in my suburb, the first question I'm asked is whether I live ""around here."" Not one of my white friends has been asked that question when they were pulled over by a police officer. Last summer, my teenage daughter was shopping with four white friends at a mall in an affluent St. Louis suburb. As they left the store, two mall security guards approached my daughter. They told her the store had called them and reported her as a shoplifter, and asked her to come with them. After a search, they found she had nothing. So far in her young life, mall security guards have stopped her on suspicion of shoplifting three times. Each time she was innocent. I also have three sons. My two oldest are 22. They are 6-foot-5 and 6-foot-4 and each weighs more than 220 pounds. One recently graduated from college; the other will graduate in 2015. The youngest is 13. All three like to wear jeans and the latest sneakers. They love hoodies. They like looking cool. These three young men have never been arrested or even been in a fight at school. Every time my sons leave the house, I worry about their safety. One of my sons loves to go out at night to clubs. I worry about potential unrest at the clubs -- yes, black-on-black crime is a problem, and despite what many people think, black people complain about it all the time in their communities and churches and in newspapers and on radio stations. I also worry about his drive home and his being stopped by police. The data in Ferguson are an example of the larger picture in the St. Louis County area. Police stop, search and arrest black people at a disproportionate rate, even though they are less likely to possess contraband than white people. This son of mine who likes to go out at night is big and tall and he has brown skin. He graduated from college in May but cannot find employment. He is an intelligent, clean-cut young man. But the negative stereotypes automatically assigned to his skin color follow him everywhere, even in job interviews, like extra weight. It reminds me of the airline employee who asks before you can check your suitcase: Did a stranger ask you to carry something or pack your bag? In my son's case, the answer is yes. He is carrying extra weight, unfairly, and without his knowledge or consent, packed in his luggage. A few years ago my husband and I went on a cruise. My older boys were teenagers at the time and were taking summer enrichment classes at a school about a mile from our home. They planned to walk to school in the morning. At the top of a long list of things to do before we left for our trip was ""e-mail chief of police."" I explained to the chief that my husband and I were going on a cruise, I was a member of the community and that my two sons would be walking to school. I attached pictures of the boys, explaining that only a couple of black families lived in the neighborhood. My sons did not normally walk in the neighborhood, so they would draw attention. I offered to bring my sons to the police department so officers could meet them. The police chief and I met and all went well. But I've asked myself: How many parents of white sons have thought to add to their to-do-before-leaving-town list, ""Write letter to local police department, introducing sons and attaching photos, so police do not become suspicious and harass them""? Even though my older boys are men, I still worry about them. I worry about my 13-year-old. This worry is a stressful, and sadly normal, part of my daily existence. My youngest will be 6 feet tall in the coming weeks. He has brown skin. These young black men have arrows pointed and ready to shoot at them daily -- black-on-black crime, police encounters, societal bias and mistrust. Shortly after the Michael Brown shooting, I met with a group of my 13-year-old's black male friends to explain to them what happened in Ferguson, and what to do and how to respond if they are ever stopped by the police. My words reminded me of stories and fears my grandfather used to share with me about his encounters with police during the Jim Crow era. These are just a few of the many ways in which people in America are treated differently based on the color of their skin. This has been going on for a long time. I hope the events in Ferguson will encourage people to see the stark differences in the experiences of black people -- not just black people who struggle economically but also black people like me -- and white people as they go about their routine, daily lives.","Kimberly Norwood, a black woman and lawyer, lives in a suburb 12 miles from Ferguson .

"It's a hot, sunny Sunday morning, and birds are chirping in the trees over the heads of children playing on swings and in a pile of sand in a small park in front of City Hall. Or what used to be City Hall, anyway. Today, it's a burned-out husk of a building, the ground around it thick with ash and crunchy with broken glass, official documents strewn around and covered with footprints. Windows are shattered. Walls are stained black by smoke and fire. A dozen or so young men lounge around on the front steps of the building, asserting that they are part of the militia of the Donetsk People's Republic. But they look more like drunks with nowhere else to go after a night out. But they're not the only ones hanging around the remains of City Hall in Mariupol, recently the scene of clashes between supporters of the central government and backers of either independence or union with Russia for this part of eastern Ukraine. Yevgeny Bulgakov, a steelworker, is here too, wearing his thick Ilyich factory work jacket despite the heat of the day. He's here to help re-establish order in the city, he said. And indeed, despite the destruction of City Hall, the scene is much calmer than it was a month ago, when the building stood behind a makeshift barricades of tires, bricks and paving stones. That's gone today. The only remnants are a coil of barbed wire discarded among spring flowers and a small pile of tires by the street corner. Did the steelworkers bring calm? Some are giving credit for the restoration of order here to the steelworkers. There are tens of thousands of them in this industrial city where factories spew brown and gray smoke along the road into town. About 11,000 of them signed up to help patrol Mariupol along with local police, according to the company MetInvest, which employs them. The patrols come alongside an agreement signed by a wide range of leaders in Mariupol to try to de-escalate the situation. The deal came five days after violence in the city left at least seven people dead and 40 wounded, according to Human Rights Watch. The steelworkers are backed by their boss, Donetsk-based billionaire Rinat Akhmetov, who came out against both independence and union with Russia last week. Many of them are paid for the time they patrol, MetInvest said. But steelworkers are not the only ones on patrol. They only make up about a third of the total volunteer force, locals say. And hard-core supporters of independence for the region don't give them credit for restoring order. A group of about a dozen steelworkers was jeered as several hundred supporters of independence gathered for a march Sunday to mark the killings on May 9 that seem to have been a turning point in the city. Hard questions for separatist leader . But the separatist crowd also has hard questions for the local separatist military commander, Andrey Borisov, an angular man with a shaggy beard and close-cropped hair under a beret. They surrounded him and peppered him with questions as he smoked and sweated in the hot sun. He didn't seem to be able to say who's in control. ""Who will govern? You will be the first one to come up to me when you don't have your pension paid. The transition of power is a complicated process,"" he said. And he admitted that the separatists need more men. ""We need guys who are able to take arms and fight,"" he said to the crowd, composed mostly of people middle-aged and older, none of whom volunteered for the job. That could be a problem for the self-declared local political leader, Denis Kuzmenko. Kuzmenko vowed firmly Sunday that the people of Mariupol would not participate in Ukraine's presidential election scheduled to take place in a week. The friendly, slightly chubby man wore a pistol in a holster on his hip as he spoke to journalists outside his headquarters, a tightly secured brick police station taken over by the separatists. His words were firm. ""We consider trying to open up a polling station and trying to establish an opportunity to vote as a provocation. We will treat it as such,"" he said. But can he carry out the threat? He all but admitted he doesn't have enough men to control the city when asked whether he needed the steelworkers to help maintain order. ""Of course we need everyone,"" he said, saying there are 50,000 steelworkers in the area, and that the majority support independence. He denied there was a divide between ""the steelworkers"" and the people. ""They are patrolling because they support the Donetsk People's Republic and they want order,"" he said. As Kuzmenko spoke, his security guard, a clean-cut man with shiny gray trousers, violet shirt and AK-47, came over to a journalist, tugged his arm and spoke English. ""Our citizens are the steelworkers,"" he said. ""It is the same.""","An easy calm has settled over Mariupol, a city in the eastern part of Ukraine .

"It's hard not to be nervous, standing outside the Ebola isolation wards. The wards are a cluster of unassuming white tents in the middle of a large field, not far from the center of the city. Each is just big enough to hold around 10 cots. Two layers of zippers keep the outside from getting in, and more importantly here -- the opposite. Nobody goes inside the tent without spending 15 minutes putting on isolation gear. The nurse handing over my garb calls it my ""space suit."" I can't help but think that going into an Ebola isolation ward is a little bit like going to the moon. In H.G. Wells' ""The War of the Worlds,"" seemingly invincible invaders from Mars are laid low by Earth's microbes, for which they have no defense. With Ebola, we humans are the invaders. The sense of being an alien in the world of this virus is jarring. Outside the tent, the air is sticky and has a distinctive smell of bleach. The bleach is in large plastic jugs; people use it liberally to wash their hands. It mixes with the smell of smoke, wafting from an enormous pit in the ground, full of smoldering ashes. I am told everything that comes out of these wards is burned: the suits we're wearing, the sheets off the cots, even the human waste. Take no chances. Nothing kills better than fire. After the 2012 Ebola outbreak in Uganda finally ended, medical teams scorched the earth. The patients inside the tent are infected with one of the most deadly pathogens in the world. Ebola has no treatment, no vaccine and no cure. Ebola: What you need to know . There are at least five different strains of Ebola, and in past outbreaks, this virus -- the Zaire strain -- has killed as many as nine out of 10 people it infects. Men and women, young and old. Ebola does not discriminate. I geared up with Tim Jagatic, a physician from Ontario. He wants to give me an idea of what it is like to walk in his boots. He is with Doctors Without Borders, and he has been here for three weeks, almost since the beginning of the outbreak. This trip is his first time seeing Ebola. ""No family at home,"" he told me, no one to dissuade him from coming here. He seemed a little surprised I even asked. In this line of work, having a family is a job liability. Jagatic is a different kind of doctor. He doesn't just care for patients; he risks his own life to help save theirs. Sometimes, neither patient nor doctor makes it. Since the beginning of this Ebola outbreak, 112 people have died in Guinea and 13 in neighboring Liberia; at least 17 have been health care workers, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization. Standing outside the tent, I silently remind myself of the science and the facts, to try and calm myself down. The virus does not spread through the air and doesn't live on surfaces for very long. Keep your hands to yourself and stay vigilant, I remind my producer Danielle Dellorto and cameraman Neil Hallsworth. I'm reminding myself, too. There is a habit I've had since I was a child. I bite my nails when I'm nervous. I stare at my cuticles now; they look dry and cracked. My skin appears broken. It's not just unsightly; it's a potential threat, a pathway for the virus to enter my body. The day before, one of the doctors showed me a small cut on his hand. ""They grounded me,"" he said. He was not allowed in the isolation areas, because that simple cut was too big a risk. Gupta: Ebola a swift, effective and bloody killer . Before you go into the isolation ward, you stop in a separate tent to gear up. Jagatic and I are in one of these anterooms, dressed in scrubs and thick white rubber boots. We are already sweating, and we haven't even begun to put on the ""moon"" suits. It is 100 degrees outside. First we slip on a pair of blue latex gloves, then a thick yellow impermeable suit. A mask goes on, then a white hood with another mask built into it. A pair of large clear goggles is wrapped around the hood and then a large white apron. Finally, we slip on another pair of latex gloves. Not a single part of my skin is exposed. Jagatic triple-checks to make sure. It has to be this way for these doctors and nurses who knowingly expose themselves to Ebola, dispensing medication, hanging IVs and using needles to draw blood, but you have to wonder what goes through the minds of the patients, seeing these rubber-clad aliens looming in front of them. Imagine developing a fever, cough and muscle aches and then suddenly being isolated in a ward where your only visitors look like this. The patients here are sick and scared. The doctors and nurses write their names in large black letters on the aprons, so they can seem slightly more human to the people for which they care. It occurs to me that a mask, or two, shouldn't make a difference since this virus isn't airborne. I ask Jagatic, who reminds me that the average person subconsciously touches his or her face a few thousand times a day. The masks are reminders that nothing inside this ward is considered safe. WHO: Ebola outbreak one of 'most challenging' I am drenched in sweat, and I've only been in the outer tent for five minutes. I've experienced just a sliver of what goes into making rounds when your patients have Ebola. I wait here while Jagatic continues on, inside the quarantined space, to spend about an hour with his patients. Before leaving the camp, I share all the latest Ebola figures with Jagatic, and we compare notes. Instead of the feared 90% death rate, in this outbreak it's running closer to 65%. Still terrible, no doubt, but also tangible evidence that Jagatic and his team are saving lives. Still soaked in sweat, he smiles weakly. Truth is, even he gets a little nervous doing this sort of work. But he does it so the people outside these wards, people all over the world, will never know what it's like to be inside.

"(CNN)This week, three more women came forward to accuse Bill Cosby of drugging and assaulting them. That brings the total up to more than 30 women who have accused the comedian and actor of sexual assault in events going back decades. All of the allegations have passed statutes of limitations, which means rape charges cannot be filed. The women's reasons for not coming forward earlier amount to: fear of retaliation, and fear no one would believe them. Fear. A few days ago, it appeared that former ""Cosby Show"" cast mate Phylicia Rashad was condemning the women making the allegations. ""Forget these women,"" Showbiz 411 had quoted Rashad as saying. ""What you're seeing is the destruction of a legacy. And I think it's orchestrated."" She was subsequently blasted throughout the media for what many took to be a dismissal of rape victims and a defense of Cosby. On Wednesday, in an interview with ABC News, Rashad said she was misquoted and attempted to clarify those comments. What she'd meant to say was that, ""This is not about the women. This is about something else. This is about the obliteration of legacy,"" she said. She blamed the media for declaring ""guilt without proof"" and described Cosby as ""a genius. He's generous. He's kind."" Over the past several months, allegations have painted Cosby as a sexual predator, a serial rapist, a man who, over many decades, allegedly drugged and assaulted women, many of whom had viewed him as a mentor and guide. Still, no charges have been filed. He has not stood trial. He has not been convicted. (His attorneys have vehemently denied the allegations.) Which raises the question: Could a man accused of such things by so many ever deserve defense? What if the man is someone you call a friend? It's fairly easy for most of us to condemn Bill Cosby, because he is not a person we actually know. For Rashad, the matter becomes more complicated. Cutting out a stranger is one thing; cutting out a friend is another. And yet that's what Rashad has to do -- that's what we all have to do. We all have friends who have acted badly in one way or another. Maybe -- and I mean maybe -- you can continue a friendship with someone who has been accused, once, of rape, if you have asked the right questions and satisfied yourself that the one allegation is not true. But you cannot say, ""It's none of my business,"" or ""We don't know the story."" The simple fact is you cannot be friends with a man whose accusers are in the double digits, even if this man is still walking free -- perhaps especially if this man is still walking free. Not if you want the rape of women to stop happening. That Cosby likely won't be charged for any of the alleged crimes he is accused of is a scenario not at all unique to him. Every year, literally countless men who engage in sexual violence against women do not face charges, for reasons as varied and familiar as those given by the women in the Cosby scandal. The law is not perfect, and has limitations. That's where the rest of us come in. Boycotting these men, excluding them from our lives, not being their friends, their defenders, their devil's advocates. Holding them accountable. Turning our backs. Stopping the rationalizations. This is where and how we take a stand.","Peggy Drexler: Phylicia Rashad defended Bill Cosby, accused in multiple alleged rapes .

"Five people were treated for injuries at Navarra Hospital on Sunday, after the final ritual running of the bulls at the Festival of San Fermin in Pamplona, Spain. The most serious of Sunday's injuries was sustained by a 23-year-old Australian woman, who was gored in the chest. According to an official report, the woman suffered fractured rubs and damage to her right lung. Her condition was described as ""grave"" by the regional government, which hosts the festival. Three men were gored on Friday, including an American who underwent emergency surgery to remove his spleen, and another American who suffered a ""rectal perforation."" On Saturday, natives of Spain and Ireland were listed in ""serious condition"" after being trampled, apparently by people, during a pileup of some 200 runners and two bulls near the entrance to the festival's main bullring. At least 20 people sustained injuries in the pileup. Crazy? Brave? Drunk? What drives Pamplona's bull runners? As part of the nine-day festival, which celebrates San Fermin, patron saint of Pamplona and the Navarra region, human thrill seekers run through the streets of Pamplona amid groups of six charging bulls. The run takes place each day of the festival (excluding opening day) at 8 a.m. Many of the runners stay up all night, filling themselves with liquid courage before making the inebriated dash in the early light. After a pair of rockets are set off, the bulls charge through crowds of runners for about 920 yards, the distance between the bull corral and bullring. The run generally takes three or four minutes to complete. This year's festival ended on Sunday with a reported 206 people sustaining injuries during the bull runs. According to various reports, 13, 14 or 15 runners have been killed at the running of the bulls over the last century. The most recent fatality was in 2009 when a 27-year-old man from Madrid died after being gored in the neck.","Australian woman gored in chest on final day of running with the bulls in Pamplona, Spain .

"The Dogecoin started off as a penniless Internet joke. But Matt Thompson plans on selling his vacation home for this meme-inspired currency. The 27-year-old entrepreneur has been selling games and gadgets over the Internet for years, but nothing as big as his Wisconsin vacation home, which he is offering for 100 million Dogecoins. Dogecoin (pronounced DOHJ-coin) isn't something tangible like the dollar bills in your wallet. It's an open source file-sharing form of cryptocurrency that was created by programmer Billy Markus in December 2013. The newbie cryptocurrency started off as a parody of Bitcoin, using the image of a perplexed Japanese dog. Chances are, you've probably seen Dogecoin's mascot somewhere on the Internet already. As the Shiba Inu would say: Wow, much coin-cidence. But this satirical currency isn't just a punchline anymore. Through trading and transactions between users, the currency went from being worth nothing to being valued at more than $65 million, and it has a uniquely supportive community of users from the site Reddit. Thompson, a user of Bitcoins since 2011, started buying and selling Dogecoins two days after they were made available online. But the early adopter didn't think of selling his vacation home for cryptocurrency until his property got no offers after several months on the market. His three-bedroom, two-bath home is one of 2,300 properties on sale in Sawyer County, in the state's northern woods. To attract potential buyers, he decided to accept Dogecoins as a payment form. He sees potential in it. ""I don't mind holding on to (Dogecoins) for a multitude of reasons, including that I believe I can use them to further my business,"" he explained. Thompson, who lives in Minnesota, primarily sells video and electronic game accessories online. He's been able to buy and sell inventory from places such as China by using the digital currency. ""It's safe and easy with minimal fees,"" he said. ""To date, I've found it to be very good for supplementing payment methods."" Timothy Lee, who has written about cryptocurrency for The Washington Post, says Dogecoin can be a feasible alternative to Bitcoin, but it is important to put it into context. Bitcoin is the most popularly traded cryptocurrency and has the largest community of users in the digital currency realm. Dogecoin is one of the top 10 cryptocurrencies, but it has a far smaller following. Ben Doernberg of the Dogecoin Foundation -- yes, the founders even established a nonprofit organization -- says what makes it special compared with its competitors is its community. ""It was important to the founders that the currency would be friendly and accepting. Most of these Bitcoin competitors are created to make a lot of money, but it's hard to generate a healthy supportive community,"" he said. Doernberg estimates that more than 100,000 people use Dogecoin actively. That does make for a limited pool of users who can fork up Thompson's 100 million Dogecoin price tag, which translates to roughly $135,000. The value of a Dogecoin is about one-tenth of a penny, whereas a Bitcoin is valued at a hefty $630 -- and at their peak Bitcoins were trading at $1,200. Bitcoin prices plunge as technical problems persist . Even though the value of Dogecoin is only a fraction of other cryptocurrenices, that doesn't mean it's easy to earn. There's a process, says Dogecoin user Lionel Vogt, who first shared Thompson's story with CNN iReport. The Georgia resident explained that people use graphic cards and their computers to help ""mine"" Dogecoins. (In doge-ism speak, it's called ""digging"" for coins.) Mining is the process used to create digital currencies -- it's where computers solve mathematical equations in exchange for Dogecoins. It's similar to producing other popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Litecoin and Peercoin. Dogecoin even has its own website, which has step-by-step instructions on how to get started using the currency. It also features a flashy introductory video of an animated Shiba Inu flying through a fictional city on a rocket ship. The Dogecoin community is doing more than just joking around and financing online shopping sprees. The currency is being used to raise money for events and people. Before the Sochi Winter Olympics kicked off, Dogecoin fundraisers helped send the Jamaican bobsled team and an Indian luge contender to Russia to compete in the Games. The Dogecoin Foundation and Reddit's r/Dogecoin community were able to raise more than $30,000 for the two causes. Bitcoin regulations coming this year . Despite the Dogecoin community's generosity, Thompson says the cryptocurrency has its critics. ""So many people, especially people involved with Bitcoin, tend to believe it's a copycat. I really don't think you can be so shortsighted. I believe the value of an economic system is the sum of all of its parts. So, there is room for all sorts of coins,"" he said. Markus, the creator of Dogecoin, explains that the currency is not meant to be a rival to Bitcoin. Both use the same technology. ""Dogecoin wouldn't be where it is without Bitcoin leading the way,"" said the Portland, Oregon, resident. ""Bitcoin is the trailblazer and Dogecoin is a friendly spin that helps introduce the world of cryptocurrency."" Dogecoin's longevity is also dependent on network effect, Lee explains. ""Dogecoin is sort of this self-fulfilling prophecy,"" he said. ""The more people who accept it, the more value it has. Bitcoin has a head start on that,"" he said. Bitcoin has been around for five years whereas Dogecoin has been in circulation for three months. With the cryptocurrency still in its infancy and only a fraction of the value of its popular counterparts, it begs the question: Has Thompson received any offers for his six-acre vacation home? Not yet, he says. But he's definitely made an impression with the Dogecoin community. ""I've been asked a lot of questions about this house, and I think it's a good effect. It gets more people talking,"" he said. Dogecoin Foundation's Doernberg says all the chatter is a good thing for the digital currency. ""The U.S. dollar is only valuable because people are willing to accept it. In currency, that is the most important thing,"" he said. ""Dogecoin's priorities are 'let's get everyone to the moon,' "" Doernberg said. ""Cryptocurrency is really powerful and instead of locking it up for a few people, let's get everyone in the world on it.""","After failing to get any offers, a man says he'll take Dogecoins for his vacation home .

"At least 1,900 Hong Kongers took the streets to call for democracy on a sweltering Sunday afternoon, an energetic prelude to Wednesday's scheduled mass vigil honoring the 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown. The protesters, many of whom were students, marched to Hong Kong's government headquarters shouting ""democracy now"" and ""end one-party rule."" A team carried a massive banner demanding Chinese leaders formally acknowledge what happened on June 4th, 1989, while others carried signs demanding the release of political prisoners such as Nobel Prize-winning dissident Liu Xiaobo. One of the lead marchers was Yvonne Leung, 20, the president of the Hong Kong University Students Union. ""Personally, my main concern is to end one-party rule in China, because the Communist Party is ruling illegitimately,"" she said. ""It doesn't have the Chinese's people's mandate... and it is not acceptable. Democracy is a universal value."" Another protester, 21-year-old Vincent Wong, said he was protesting to keep the memory of the Tiananmen victims alive. ""The Tiananmen Square massacre was a mistake,"" he said. ""Mistakes can be forgiven, but history cannot be forgotten."" Doubts over free speech . The former British colony is currently the only place within Chinese territory where large pro-democracy demonstrations are tolerated. Still, many of its residents are worried that the city's freedoms are steadily eroding. In February, journalists organized a 6,500-person rally decrying what they said were increasing levels of coercion against Hong Kong press. Days after the rally, a prominent Hong Kong news editor known for his hard-hitting coverage of China was stabbed by unidentified assailants. The attack, which is still being investigated, was seen by many local journalists a symbol of the city's declining press freedom. ""If a respected editor could be attacked in such a blatant and ruthless manner, no one in the news-gathering business is safe,"" wrote South China Morning Post columnist Alex Lo. This year, French-based Reporters Without Borders ranked Hong Kong 61st worldwide in press freedom  — a precipitous drop from its 18th place ranking in 2002. READ MORE: Hong Kong press freedom at all-time low . Calls for electoral reform . The city is also facing an impending showdown with Beijing over electoral reform. Pan-democrat Hong Kongers want the city's general population to be able to nominate and elect its next chief executive, but Hong Kong's pro-Beijing politicians have argued that a small committee should select only candidates who ""love China."" Later this month, a pro-democracy group called Occupy Central plans to hold an unofficial citywide referendum asking Hong Kong's citizens to vote for their preferred type of electoral reform, a move that has irked the city's pro-Beijing establishment. If the results show support for public nomination and elections, Occupy Central says it will block traffic in Hong Kong's crowded downtown to pressure the government to adopt its reforms. A January poll by the non-partisan Hong Kong Transition Project found 38% of Hong Kongers supported Occupy Central's proposed civil disobedience, while 54% opposed it. China's vice president has warned that such a protest would be ""unlawful"" and would ""wreck the stability and prosperity"" of the city. For now, hundreds of thousands of Hong Kongers are expected to attend the city's annual June 4th vigil, where the Communist Party is certain to come under vicious public criticism. More loud protests are guaranteed. What's less certain is whether Hong Kong will find a political solution.","At least 1,900 Hong Kongers took the streets to call for democracy .

"(CNN) -- Sherwood Schwartz, the prolific television writer and producer best known as the creator of the iconic sitcoms ""Gilligan's Island"" and ""The Brady Bunch,"" died Tuesday morning in Los Angeles. He was 94. Schwartz's wife of 70 years, Mildred, confirmed to CNN that Schwartz had died after being hospitalized for an infection the past 10 days. She and the couple's daughter Hope Juber were with Schwartz when ""he died peacefully"" at about 4 a.m. (7 a.m. ET). ""He had a very good life,"" Mildred Schwartz said. ""It's just too bad it had to come to an end."" Schwartz got his break in TV as a writer for ""The Red Skelton Hour,"" for which he got two Emmy Award nominations, winning one. But he first left his most indelible mark by creating and producing two ensemble sitcoms: ""Gilligan's Island,"" which aired for 98 episodes on CBS starting in 1964, and ""The Brady Bunch,"" which aired on ABC from 1969 to 1974. Neither show was among the most popular of its era, but both went on to enjoy much wider audiences in syndication, and Schwartz capitalized on their enduring popularity by producing numerous ""reunion"" specials, including ""Rescue From Gilligan's Island"" (1978) and ""A Very Brady Christmas"" (1988). Schwartz was awarded a star on Hollywood's ""Walk of Fame"" in 2008, according to website IMDb. ""Sherwood was a wonderful writer and producer, but more importantly he was a wonderful husband, father, grandfather and friend,"" said Florence Henderson, who starred as mom Carol on ""The Brady Bunch."" ""His sense of humor never failed him and I always looked so forward to hearing his stories. They were endless and made you laugh so hard that tears would be running down your cheeks. Most of these stories were about the mishaps in his own life."" Henderson said that ever since she met him, in 1969, ""I don't ever remember him losing his temper. Ultimately, he was a wonderful teacher in life and again, in death, he taught us how to leave with dignity and courage."" Along with his wife and daughter, Schwartz is survived by three children, eight grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. The family is planning a private memorial for the end of the week.","TV writer and producer Sherwood Schwartz, 94, died early Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- It was the pot story read around the world. Dr. Sanjay Gupta is used to making headlines. The brain surgeon and CNN's chief medical correspondent can't even leave his office and walk through CNN Center without tour groups stopping him to take his picture or compliment his work. But this time the intensity of interest in a story he wrote for CNN.com about how he changed his mind about the effectiveness of medical marijuana was something even he didn't anticipate. ""The attention has been pretty intense, and I was a little surprised,"" Gupta said. ""I know it's a provocative topic, but the science is there to back it up."" More than 330,000 people shared the story on Facebook, and it started to trend on Twitter. His column inspired pot jokes as well as thoughtful conversations in publications around the world. Vanity Fair referred to him as the ""Dr. Phil of actual licensed physicians."" The Los Angeles Times said it wouldn't go so far as to call him Dr. ""Feelgood"" but remarked about his change of heart. The Washington gossip site Wonkette posted a story with the headline, ""When you've lost Sanjay Gupta you've lost America: Sanjay Gupta wants to get 'high' on the pot like a common jazz criminal."" Even the usually sober Washington Post used its piece as a jumping-off point to ask, ""Is pot the new gay marriage?"" Some polls show more than half of all Americans now support both same-sex marriage and marijuana. While the majority of Americans may share his opinion, Gupta said the medical community has been a little slower to embrace it. ""I understand there is concern that if you legalize it, kids will use it recreationally, and I don't want young people to do that, but our concern for their safety shouldn't keep patients who need this from getting access,"" Gupta said. After his article appeared Thursday, Gupta said he received calls and e-mails from people from all walks of life who were grateful he started the conversation. Doctors, judges, politicians and clergy got in touch to thank him for speaking up. And of course, he's had to put up with a lot of pot jokes. But he called it an important message more people need to hear. ""I guess I've tapped into something that hit at the right time,"" Gupta said. ""That, or it was a really slow news day."" .","Dr. Sanjay Gupta changes his mind, says medical marijuana is a good idea .

"(CNN)  -- South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford, just back from a secret trip to Argentina unknown to his staff or his wife, admitted Wednesday he has carried on an extramarital affair with a woman in Buenos Aires, Argentina. South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford chokes up on Wednesday as he admits to having an affair. ""I've been unfaithful to my wife,"" Sanford told a news conference in Columbia, South Carolina. ""I developed a relationship with what started as a dear, dear friend from Argentina."" His voice choking at times, Sanford apologized to his wife and four sons, his staff and supporters, and said he would resign immediately as head of the Republican Governors Association. The affair began in the last year and was discovered five months ago, Sanford said without elaborating. He added that he and his wife were trying to work through it.  Watch Sanford admit to the affair » . In a statement issued later Wednesday, Sanford's wife, Jenny, said she asked him to move out two weeks earlier but was still open to a reconciliation for the benefit of their children. ""I remain willing to forgive Mark completely for his indiscretions and to welcome him back, in time, if he continues to work toward reconciliation with a true spirit of humility and repentance,"" Jenny Sanford said. The South Carolina governor had not been seen in public since June 18. When questioned, Sanford's staff told media outlets Sanford was hiking on the Appalachian Trail. But Sanford was spotted Wednesday in Atlanta, Georgia's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport. Sanford said he had been in Buenos Aires. He said it was his fault for ""shrouding this larger trip."" ""I'm a bottom-line kind of guy. I'll lay it out, it's going to hurt, and we'll let the chips fall as they may,"" Sanford told reporters.  View a timeline of the events » . The affair began as a friendship eight years ago, but ""over this last year, it developed into something much more than that,"" Sanford said. ""All I can say is that I apologize,"" he said, adding that he would appreciate a ""zone of privacy"" for the sake of his family. Sanford also traveled to Argentina a year ago as part of a South Carolina Commerce Department-funded trip to South America, according to an itinerary of the trip obtained by CNN. It was unclear if he met with the woman on that trip. On Wednesday, Sanford said he footed the bill for his most recent trip to Buenos Aires. The governor said earlier in the day he had traveled to Argentina twice before. When asked if he is trying to reconcile with his wife, Sanford nodded, ""I am, yeah."" Asked if he and his wife are separated, he said, ""I don't know how you want to define that. I mean, I'm here and she's there. I guess in a formal sense we're not, but what we're trying to do is work through something that we've been working through for a number of months now."" However, the statement by Jenny Sanford said the couple was in a ""trial separation"" after trying to work through the problem in recent months. ""We reached a point where I felt it was important to look my sons in the eye and maintain my dignity, self-respect, and my basic sense of right and wrong,"" she said in the statement. ""I therefore asked my husband to leave two weeks ago. This trial separation was agreed to with the goal of ultimately strengthening our marriage."" Jenny Sanford said there was no contact with her husband during the separation, and she did not know he was in Argentina in recent days. Also Wednesday, The State newspaper of Columbia published e-mails between Sanford and a Buenos Aires resident named ""Maria"" from July 2008. It said the e-mails were acquired in December, and that the governor's office confirmed their authenticity. When contacted by CNN, a spokesman for the governor would neither confirm nor deny the authenticity of the e-mails. ""You have a particular grace and calm that I adore. You have a level of sophistication that so fitting with your beauty,"" Sanford wrote on July 10, according to the e-mails published on the newspaper's Web site. ""I could digress and say that you have the ability to give magnificent gentle kisses, or that I love your tan lines or that I love the curve of your hips, the erotic beauty of you holding yourself (or two magnificent parts of yourself) in the faded glow of the night's light -- but hey, that would be going into sexual details."" The e-mail continues, ""While all the things above are all too true -- at the same time we are in a ... hopelessly impossible situation of love. ... How in the world this lightening strike snuck up on us I am still not quite sure. As I have said to you before I certainly had a special feeling about you from the first time we met, but these feelings were contained and I genuinely enjoyed our special friendship and the comparing of all too many personal notes."" The long-term political fallout for Sanford, 49, is unclear. He has been mentioned as a potential Republican presidential candidate in 2012, after his current second consecutive term as governor ends. South Carolina's constitution forbids a third straight term. Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour immediately takes over as head of the Republican Governors Association, CNN has learned.  Recent political sex scandals » . ""The news revealed today hurts all of us who have gotten to know Gov. Sanford over the years and so it is with regret that the RGA accepted Gov. Sanford's resignation as chairman,"" Barbour said in a statement. ""While this news is deeply disappointing, I also know it's important to remain focused on the future and Gov. Sanford's resignation allows him and us to do just that."" Shortly after Sanford's announcement, Nathan Daschle, executive director of the Democratic Governors Association, issued a statement saying, ""Our thoughts and prayers are with Gov. Sanford and his family, and I wish them the best as they try to heal this wound.""  Watch the lieutenant governor blast Sanford's trip » . However, the Republican leader in the South Carolina Senate questioned Sanford's abdication of responsibility for leaving without notice last week. ""I'm deeply disturbed that no one knew where Gov. Sanford was over the last five days,"" state Sen. Harvey Peeler said in a statement, adding: ""We cannot let the governor's personal life overshadow his public responsibility, or in this case, his negligence of gubernatorial authority."" South Carolina Republican Party Chairman Karen Floyd pledged ""every effort"" to ensure that the party maintains the trust of South Carolina's voters. ""In the hours and days ahead, I will reach out to and work with Republican office-holders, candidates, and activists to regain public confidence and win the next round of elections,"" Floyd pledged. Sanford has had a bruising year, losing his fight to turn down $700 million in federal stimulus money. Sanford initially tried to require that any stimulus money pay down the state debt, a stance rejected by the Obama administration. The South Carolina's Supreme Court ruled earlier this month that Sanford had to accept the stimulus funds. CNN's Peter Hamby and Kristi Keck contributed to this story.","S.C. Gov.
