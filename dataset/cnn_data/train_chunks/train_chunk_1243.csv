"Mike Tyson's conviction for rape came as little surprise to his former manager, who claims the ex-boxer could have been the greatest of all time but for his 'weakness for women'. Tyson became the youngest heavyweight champion in history aged just 20 when he beat Trevor Berbick in 1986 to claim the WBC title before going on to earn his status as undisputed champion. But Rory Holloway, who was a friend of Tyson's since the pair were teenagers, claims in his new book Taming the Beast: The Untold Story of Mike Tyson, that the 48-year-old's 'sex addiction' stopped him from going down in history as the best ever.

Tyson connects with a powerful right hook in the second round of his title fight with Berbick . 'I knew there was nobody in the ring who could stop him. The only reason he may not go down as the best is because of his ­weakness for women. Every decision he made was around women and sex,' Holloway is quoted as saying in The Mirror. 'I knew it would catch up with him, and it did. I don’t think there is a single person alive who could’ve changed the outcome.' Tyson was arrested in 1991 for the rape of 18-year-old beauty pageant contestant Desiree Washington in an Indianapolis hotel room. The former champion was charged the following year and sentenced to six years in prison and the only surprise to Holloway was that Tyson was not the subject of further complaints.

'All my life I’d fought to keep Mike away from women, but I’d pull up at the prison and the guards would tell me I couldn’t visit till the next day because Mike’s got women lined up to see him. 'He was getting more women in there than he was outside. I ended up sleeping in the damn parking lot.'

"A bizarre phenomenon was spotted over Britain this week which looked like someone had punched a hole in the sky. However, experts at the Met Office say the hole was in fact a holepunch or fallstreak cloud. This atmospheric phenomenon is believed to be caused by a combination of both mother nature and man. Experts say this pattern was probably caused by ice crystals forming round an aeroplane . For . the fallstreak hole to begin, cirrocumulus or altocumulus must contain . super-cooled water which cannot freeze without a tiny particle to first . cling to. Scientific . opinion as to what finally causes the ice to form and begin to . crystallize in the atmosphere has only solidified in recent years as . meteorologists have become more certain that airplanes flying through . the clouds start the process. Air passing along propeller blades . or wings expands and cools rapidly. The ice crystals begin to form and . after the plane is long gone - the crystals can still be seen where . they've dropped down below the cloud. What's left above the drifting ice particles is a round hole in the cloud that can sometimes be very  large. #ufo? A strange cloud formation that hovered above Southern California in May was a fallstreak cloud . If the sun catches the particles at just the right angle, another . phenomenon called a sun dog can form as a bright patch of colored light . hovering in the sky. This photograph was taken by Marc Eilbeck and posted on Twitter. Nicole Maxey, from the Met Office, said: 'This is a holepunch or fallstreak cloud. 'It forms when part of the cloud layer forms ice crystals which are large enough to fall. 'This happens in clouds of supercooled water droplets – water that is below 0°C but not yet frozen. 'These water droplets need a tiny particle, a nucleus, to freeze or to be cooled below -40°C. 'Aircraft punching through this cloud layer can cause air to expand and cool as it passes over the aircraft wings or propeller. 'This change in temperature can be enough to encourage the supercooled droplets to freeze and fall from the cloud layer in this distinctive pattern.'","Experts at the Met Office say the hole is a holepunch or fallstreak cloud .

"A first-grade teacher accused of inappropriately touching one of her students has denied the allegation and is using her own prejudice as a defense. Irene Esther Stokes, 61, was arrested last Thursday and charged with indecency with a child following allegations that she touched the ‘private parts’ of a six-year-old girl student at Northwest Prep Academy in Humble, Texas. According to court documents, the first grader told her mother that Stokes ordered all the other kids out of the classroom on March 1. Teacher Irene Esther Stokes, 61, denies inappropriately touching a seven-year-old girl in her class and is using her own prejudice as a defense . ‘The victim said that she was in the classroom alone with the teacher and that the teacher touched her on the outside of her clothes, on what she called her “private part,” her vaginal area,’ Humble Police Department Detective J. Blanchard told KHOU.com. The girl said when she asked the teacher to stop, she was told to get out of the classroom, according to court records. The girl told investigators that Stokes then made her stand out in the hallway outside of the classroom and refused to allow her to eat lunch or take a test. The child’s mother contacted school officials and was able to confirm that the girl did not eat lunch at school that day. Stokes has denied the allegations despite reportedly failing a polygraph test. A spokesperson for Northwest Preparatory Academy Charter School in Humble, Texas says Stokes is no longer employed at the school . ‘She (said she) doesn’t like to even touch the black children on their hand, she shies away when they try to hug her - she admitted to being prejudice,’ Blanchard said. Stokes also allegedly told investigators that she ‘doesn’t like the student and has little to no interaction with her,’ according to court records. Following an internal investigation at the school, Stokes has lost her job. ‘The employee involved was immediately placed on administrative leave as soon as the complaint was received, and the matter was investigated.  As a result of the Academy’s investigation, the staff member in question has been terminated,” the school said in a statement released Tuesday. Stokes is scheduled to appear in court on May 21. She was released from jail on a $10,000 bond.","Irene Ester Stokes has been charged with indecency with a child .

"Margarita Clark, who has been jailed for 40 months after stealing more than £2.5million from friends to fund a lavish lifestyle . DRESSED immaculately in designer clothes with Louis Vuitton accessories, Margarita Clark simply reeked of success. Seduced by her perfectly groomed appearance, a 'Footballers' Wives lifestyle' and tales of her success refurbishing properties, friends were persuaded to sink huge sums of money into her business. But the investments were used to fund her taste for luxuries, which included a converted barn home with Italian furniture, trips to top restaurants and five-star holidays – one on a Caribbean cruise with a personal butler. When police caught up with her she had burned through more than £2.5 million. One victim lost £1,050,000 and others lost six-figure sums. They are unlikely to get much back as Clark, 63, was £8,000 overdrawn when she was arrested. She has now been jailed for more than three years after a judge told her she had 'swindled and cheated' her friends, some of whom needed treatment for stress and depression. One victim, a friend of Clark's husband Stuart for 45 years who lost £115,000, said: 'I trusted her like a sister and didn't think anything was wrong. I knew about her lavish lifestyle and just thought it was because her business was doing well.' Another victim, who had known her for ten years and handed over £43,000, said: 'She's an awful woman. She showed no remorse at all.' Financial adviser Barry Fromson, from North Yorkshire, who lost over a million pounds, declined to talk yesterday. But in a victim impact statement read out in court, he described how he had spent 40 years working hard so that he could enjoy his retirement. 'I now feel guilt and shame having to live with this error for the rest of my life and knowing my family will suffer,' he said. A former next-door neighbour who went shopping and holidayed with the conwoman suffered a nervous breakdown after giving her £722,500. Clark was a well-known figure in Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, where she lived in an £800,000 detached house with an integrated speaker system piping music into every room. A Range Rover and a new Mini were parked outside. She and her husband, who is believed to be retired, would regularly go on holiday. St Albans Crown Court heard she spent about £60,000 a year travelling and would fly first class. Life of luxury: Her Marbella villa was 'like something out of Footballer's wives' Favourite destinations included Barbados, where she stayed in the Sandy Lane Hotel, a favourite haunt of the ultra-rich and the famous. She also visited Dubai, Florida, Las Vegas and Puerto Banus in Marbella, where she had a four-bedroom villa which was described as 'like something out of Footballers' Wives'. When in London she visited the Dorchester Hotel and she even treated one victim's family to afternoon tea at the Gleneagles Hotel in Scotland. But the enviable lifestyle was built upon her victims' misery. The greedy property investor, whose primary business was in Spain, began encouraging friends to hand over money and would string them along with excuses to avoid paying them back. One victim even hired a private investigator when she stopped returning calls and disappeared from her home for a while. She was finally arrested in September 2012 when a victim contacted the police – eight years after the scams began. Clark's scheme was based entirely on goodwill. Her victims didn't enter into formal contracts when they handed over the life-changing sums. Instead, they relied on the trust they had built up with an old friend. They were told the money was being invested in buying properties before they were sold on for a profit. When they enquired about their investments, they were assured they were safely locked up in deals. Some had no idea they were a victim of theft until the police contacted them in 2012. Some of Clark's victims were in the public gallery at St Albans Crown Court, pictured, and watched as she was led away to begin her sentence . Prosecutor Anne Evans told the court on Monday: 'No doubt in the past she had been a successful businesswoman working in property refurbishing, renting and selling in Spain. 'But a time came when, for reasons best known to herself, she started to steal from her friends and associates.' Some of Clark's six victims were in court when she was sentenced to 40 months in jail after admitting seven charges of theft. During the hearing it emerged her house had been repossessed. Her husband is now understood to live in a nearby village. Recorder Brian Argyle said that her victims had suffered 'substantial losses'. He added: 'The money has been spent by you on lavish and extravagant luxuries. 'The impact on their lives has been immense. Your behaviour has ruined them. You built up a relationship of trust and you breached that trust.'","Margarita Clark duped friend into giving her cash for bogus property deals .

"A district attorney has today decided not to file criminal charges against a man who fatally shot his 7-year-old son outside a western Pennsylvania gun store. Mercer County District Attorney Robert Kochems announced he wouldn't charge Joseph Loughrey, 44, of Jefferson Township, with carrying a firearm without a license. Kochems said he considered the charge, a misdemeanor punishable by up to five years in prison, because Loughrey's gun was loaded when he put it in his truck moments before the gun fired on December 8, killing his son, Craig. The boy had been buckling himself into his safety seat in his father's truck when the handgun, which was placed on the truck's console, fired as Loughrey got into the front seat, police said. Tragic: A Pennsylvania father accidentally shot his 7-year-old son, Craig, while he got into his truck in the parking lot of a western Pennsylvania gun store. He discovered he will not face charges today . Accident: Joseph V. Loughrey, 44, shot the boy in the chest. All charges against him were dropped today . Loughrey had removed the magazine from the pistol but didn't realize . there was still a round in the chamber when he tried to sell the 9mm . pistol at Twig's Reloading Den in East Lackawannock Township, about 60 . miles northwest of Pittsburgh, police said. When the sale didn't go . through, Loughrey brought the gun back to the truck, where it . accidentally fired. Kochems said in a statement that the evidence ""shows that Mr. Loughrey . recognized that he could not carry a loaded firearm in his vehicle and . believed he unloaded the firearm at home before taking it to the dealer . to attempt to sell it and another weapon."" Only people with a license to . carry a concealed weapon may keep a loaded gun in their vehicle, said . the statement. Kochems said his investigation determined that Loughrey stored the gun . at home in a locked location, separate from the magazine, from which . Loughrey unloaded the bullets before taking the gun with him to sell . that day. Loughrey had stored the gun that way since he last shot it . over the summer. Sorrow: 'I know that little kid was everything to him,' a friend of the father's told a local paper about the dad's relationship with his 7-year-old son, Craig, pictured, at the time . Unthinkable: Joseph Loughrey was questioned by state police about the shooting death of his son, Craig, pictured. Police said the father was cooperative and distraught and all charges were dropped today . Loughrey ""only owned the weapon for the past two years and rarely . practiced with it,"" Kochems said Tuesday in the statement. ""He had . failed to clear the chamber of the cartridge that caused his son's death . the last time he had fired the pistol and did not do so when he picked . it up months later and took it to sell."" Kochems said he still could have filed the unlicensed firearm charge . because of Loughrey's ""lack of understanding, practice and/or training"" about how he should have properly stored the firearm, but he decided not . to because Loughrey ""had a mistaken but good faith belief that he had . properly secured and stored the firearm unloaded in his home and his . belief was the proximate cause of the death of his son and not that he . was carrying the firearm in his vehicle."" Loughrey does not have a listed home telephone number and did not . immediately return a call to a cellphone number obtained Wednesday by . The Associated Press. Kochems declined to comment beyond his statement, which stressed his belief in a constitutional right to own firearms. 'I own a number myself,' the statement said. 'Further, with the . reduction of public safety forces firearms ownership may be becoming . more necessary. 'Persons who make the decision to own a firearm for personal protection . must realize that their primary purpose in owning the firearm is to kill . someone or something. They have an obligation to know how the firearm . works not just on the day they purchase it but on every occasion that . they touch it and always remembering its purpose.' Loughrey and Craig’s mother were divorced and the 44-year-old father had custody of the child over the weekend. 'I know that little kid was everything . to him,' Mark McLaughlin, a friend and co-worker of Loughrey’s at . Superior Well Services in Fredonia, told The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review at the time. 'He was a wonderful little kid. He was special. He was full of life, a lot of fun,' McLaughlin said. Cleared: A father has been cleared after he accidentally shot his little boy.

"The ‘Angelina Jolie effect’ is doubling the number of British women having both breasts removed – despite never having been diagnosed with cancer. About 800 women will go under the knife this year to follow Miss Jolie and have preventive double mastectomies – twice the normal figure – according to a nationwide study.

Inspiration: Actress Angelina Jolie underwent preventive double mastectomy last year . Miss Jolie, 38, below, had the operation in February last year after doctors said her chance  of developing breast cancer was high. Prof Evans believed that women had  seen pictures of Miss Jolie, partner of Brad Pitt, and thought: ‘If she  can look that good after her operation, perhaps it won’t be  so bad.’ Increase: About 800 women will have preventive double mastectomies is twice the normal figure .","The number of women having preventive double mastectomies double .

"This is the moment a tricksy monkey managed to escape from a leopard by hiding underneath a tree branch. The small mammal was captured giving the deadly predator the run around in woodland in East Africa. It could be seen dangling silently beneath the branch - with its arms tensed and only its tail visible. Hide and seek: A tricksy vervet monkey manages to escape from a leopard by hiding underneath a tree branch . Meanwhile, the leopard was pictured prowling along the top of the branch, just inches away. The incredible moment was captured by South African safari photographer, Chris Renshaw. Footage shows the vervet monkey staring straight ahead as it hides out of sight of its natural predator, whose large paws appear to be the same size as its prey's entire body. But despite its seemingly desperate situation, the monkey appears to have one advantage - with its light grey-coloured fur blending into its leafy surroundings. On the prowl: The monkey could be seen dangling silently beneath the branch - with only its small tail visible. Meanwhile, the leopard (pictured above) was captured prowling along the top of the branch, just inches away . Vervet monkeys are native to Africa, but do not live in jungles or deserts - instead, preferring to inhabit woodland near streams, rivers and lakes. They can grow up to 24 inches and survive by eating fruit and vegetables, often supplemented with insects, grubs and baby birds. In contrast, leopards are carnivores known for their unrivalled skill at climbing trees, ability to run at speeds of up to 36mph and adaptability to habitats, from rainforest to desert terrains.

"With its heady mix of romance, villainy and a quest for a diamond that once belonged to Blackbeard, new Sky One drama Moonfleet is the quintessential swashbuckling tale. Starring Ray Winstone as loveable rogue Elzevir, the drama also introduces newcomer Sophie Cookson as the beautiful Grace Mohune who gets an unexpectedly personal look at the world of smuggling when she falls for Elzevir's protegee John Trenchard (Aneurin Barnard). But while Grace is fictional, the women who inhabited the often-terrifying world of 18th century smuggling gangs were not - and frequently, they were just as frightening as the men. Smuggler's tale: Grace (Sophie Cookson, right) gets involved with Elzevir (Ray Winstone) and crime . Notorious: 18th century smuggler and pirate Anne Bonney made a career from seafaring crime . The earliest recorded female smugglers were Anne Bonney and Mary Read who eventually graduated from trading in counterfeit goods to full-blown piracy. Bonney, who was born to a poor Irish family in Cork in 1702, became particularly notorious - largely as a result of her relationship with fellow pirate and smuggler, Jack 'Calico Jack' Rackham. Together with Rackham and Read, an Englishwoman who had, while disguised as a man, fought in the Royal Navy, she stole a ship named the Revenge and rampaged up and down the Caribbean, harrying British shipping and sneaking illicit goods under the noses of local officials. But unlike Grace, who gets her happy ending eventually, Read and Bonney did not. By 1720, the pair were on the run and were eventually taken by pirate hunter, Captain Jonathan Barnet while enjoying a rum party with another English pirate crew off the coast of Jamaica. Although both women escaped the rope by pleading pregnancy, the pair ended their lives in squalid Jamaican prisons - in Read's case, less than a year after her arrival. While Read and Bonney are among the most famous, most female smugglers led considerably less colourful lives. In the 18th century, smuggling was rife in the UK, largely thanks to the introduction of the excise tax - introduced in 1688 to help pay for the English Civil War. Criminal: Cross-dressing pirate Mary Read began her career in the Royal Navy before turning to crime . Danger: Although Grace's tale finishes well, most smugglers ended their days in prison or penal colonies . Initially, it applied only to chocolate, coffee, tea, beer, cider and spirits but was later widened to include salt, leather, and soap. Worse, parliamentarians were unable to resist increasing it and by the mid 18th century, taxes on tea had skyrocketed to 70 per cent. As a result, smuggling gangs boomed, with women among those flocking to join them. Much of the contraband trade was focused around the south coast, including Cornwall, the Isle of Wight and Dorset, where Moonfleet is set. As Robert Louis Stevenson writes in Kidnapped: 'Few places on the British coast did not claim to be the haunts of wreckers or mooncussers. 'The thievery was boasted about and romanticised until it seemed a kind of heroism. It did not have any taint of criminality and the whole of the south coast had pockets vying with one another over whose smugglers were the darkest or most daring. 'The Smugglers Inn was one of the commonest names for a bar on the coast.' Risky business: An 18th century woodcut showing smugglers sneaking contraband goods ashore . Hotspot: Dorset, where Moonfleet is set, was popular with smugglers thanks to its network of hidden coves . Although barred from most of the more dangerous and arduous roles, women would work alongside the men to dilute illegally imported brandy before selling it on, or would gather and dry leaves to blend with smuggled batches of tea. Later, as magistrates and law enforcers devised better ways to spot illegal cargo, women were, according to Marie-Louise Jensen, author of historical novel Smuggler's Kiss, used to help sneak illicit cargo into the country using their voluminous skirts to conceal the contraband. Even alcohol could be hidden under layers of petticoats; decanted into a pig's bladder which was then tied around the waist under the skirt. Sadly, like Read and Bonney, Britain's female smugglers rarely got their happy ending. Punishments were severe and most of those caught faced lengthy periods in jail or even transportation to Australia. Although Moonfleet's John Trenchard eventually makes it home to his love, for many 18th century jailbirds, an Australian penal colony really was the end of the adventure. Moonfleet is on Sky One, tomorrow and Sunday night, at 8pm .","Like Moonfleet's Grace Mohune, women became involved with smugglers .

"A homeless man had spent three days trapped inside the wall of a Marshalls store in Colorado before firefighters were able to free him. According to the Longmont Police Department, they received a call at around 9.30am Tuesday from store employees saying they could hear a man screaming for help. The staffers were not sure where the pleas were coming from, but they believed the man was somewhere inside the department store. Firefighters in Longmont, Colorado, had to cut into the wall of a Marshalls store with a circular saw to free 35-year-old Paul Felyk, who was sore and very cold . Rescue mission: Firefighters in Longmont, Colorado, came armed with a circular saw Tuesday morning to free a man who had been trapped inside the wall of a Marshalls store for three days . Between a rock and a hard place: Paul Felyk, 35 is believed to be a vagrant who had snuck into the store through a vent in the roof and then fell 20 feet between the exterior and interior walls . Mystery: Employees at the department store in Longmont had been hearing someone screaming since at least Monday but could not find the person anywhere . Authorities said the man, later identified as 35-year-old Paul Felyk, from Westminster, was heard yelling the day before as well, but no one in the store was able to pinpoint his location, reported 9News. When first responders arrived on the scene on Ken Pratt Boulevard, they quickly determined that Felyk somehow had become lodged between an exterior wall and interior wall. Firefighters had to use a circular saw to slice into the facade of the store to free Felyk, who emerged into light just after 10am, according to Longmont Times-Call. According to police, Felyk, who is believed to be a vagrant, was able to move on his own but was very cold and sore from sitting in the cramped crawlspace for so long. The 35-year-old was taken to Longmont United Hospital, where he was listed  in fair condition Tuesday. Felyk, who is 6-foot-3 and weighing 195lbs, reportedly sneaked into the department store through a vent on the roof and then tumbled down 20 feet inside the wall. First responders were called in and quickly determined that Felyk somehow had become lodged between an exterior wall and interior wall . Harrowing ordeal: Felyk was able to crawl out of the wall on his wall, but he was very cold and sore . Not his first rodeo: Felyk has been charged with criminal trespass and theft in recent months . Police are looking into possible charges of criminal trespass, but Felyk has not been arrested yet. The 35-year-old man has had run-ins with the law under similar circumstances in recent months. Law enforcement officials spent two months this summer tracking him down after he failed to appear in court in June on charges of criminal trespass of a dwelling and theft. He was ultimately captured by the Westminster Police Department in August.","Paul Felyk, 35, was rescued Tuesday after firefighters sliced into wall of Marshalls in Longmont, Colorado, with a saw .

"Inspectors have condemned a violent 'Lord of the Flies' youth jail where teenage inmates dealt 'legal highs' and charged 'rent' for cells . A spike in assaults against prisoners and staff and direct links between bullying and levels of self-harm were also among findings in a highly critical report by HM Inspectorate of Prisons (HMIP) into Young Offender Institution (YOI) Glen Parva, in Leicestershire. Two young men killed themselves in 2013 at the prison, which at the time of the unannounced inspection held 659 inmates aged between 18 and 21, while there had been two serious near misses in 2014. Inspectors have condemned a violent 'Lord of the Flies' youth jail Glen Parva in Leicestershire . In addition, two months following the inspection, another young man committed suicide. Glen Parva, built in the early 1970s as a borstal, has been deemed 'not safe' by the inspectorate, which has called for urgent progress with reviews into arrangements for holding young adults. Inspectors believe many inmates misbehave to get themselves placed in segregation units where they would be away from the wings and feel safer. The damning report comes less than a week after a raft of bleak figures published by the Ministry of Justice revealed a leap in the number of on-the-run inmates in the last year, as well as an increase in deaths in custody and a rise in the number of jails considered to be 'of concern'. Frances Crook, chief executive of campaigners Howard League for Penal Reform, said: 'This prison is dangerous for teenagers and this sounds more like an extract from William Golding's Lord Of The Flies than a report on an institution that is meant to help young people turn their lives around. 'Yet another report of violence and idleness inflicted on teenagers by the state shows that the use of short prison sentences and remand is at the core of the problem.' In a 92-page report, inspectors said they had uncovered evidence of prisoners 'charging ""rent"" for cells with the threat of violence if this was not paid', while the YOI was not on top of the availability of legal highs such as 'Spice' and 'Black Mamba'. HMIP found that paperwork for prisoners at risk of suicide or self-harm had increased (file picture) Assaults on prisoners had risen from 121 in 2012 to 157 in 2013 and on staff had increased from 35 to 43 in the same period, HMIP said, while data for the first quarter of 2014 showed a further increaseInspectors found the number of serious incidents such as barricades, hostage taking and 'incidents at height', such as rooftop protests, had also increased. Karen Revell has said she has been left utterly devastated and heartbroken over the apparent suicide of her . son Greg, who was 18, June this year while he was at Glen Parva. She told The Howard League: 'Our thoughts are . with any other family this has happened to and pray that no other family . is left as desolate as we are without our precious baby.' The . Howard League has also been contacted by the mother of a young adult in . Glen Parva, who has asked to be moved to another prison because he . feels unsafe. She has raised her concerns in a letter to Her Majesty’s . Chief Inspector of Prisons. Here are some extracts from the letter: . During . [an earlier spell in Glen Parva] he was the victim of three separate . assaults by three different inmates, had his trainers stolen from him . whilst wearing them, been unable to leave his unit or move about the . prison due to a risk to his personal safety and has had to move units at . least five times due to acts of violence against him or bullying… The . last assault resulted in [him] being taken to [hospital] with a . suspected broken jaw… . 'Prior to my son being an inmate at Glen . Parva he had made nine suicide attempts in the space of roughly 12 . months and was hospitalised on most of these occasions. 'Glen Parva were . aware of my son’s fragile mental health, hence him being put on an ACCT . upon his arrival there. 'He was unable to leave his unit because . of the risk to his safety, so was unable to join in with any work or . activities… Is the government and its ministers aware that services they . claim to provide are actually non-existent to some inmates? 'I . am aware that presently, as before when [my son] was there, inmates are . being kept in their cells for unacceptable periods of time due to the . lack of staff! 'This raises the question of should this facility actually . be open and in use if it does not have the correct number of staff to . carry out the right procedures?' Elsewhere, HMIP found that paperwork for prisoners at risk of suicide or self-harm had increased by 32 per cent since 2012 and was high. The prison identified that in December 2013, 29 per cent of the self-harm threats or incidents had been as a direct result of being bullied, while this had reduced it was still classed as a 'cause for concern' by the inspectors. The report said: 'Unless the young men held at Glen Parva were safe, very little else would be achieved, but Glen Parva was not safe.' Chief inspector of prisons Nick Hardwick added: 'Glen Parva is a concerning institution. 'Local management can do much to improve things. There was some reassurance that many of the problems at Glen Parva had been identified and there were plans in place to address them, which they had begun to implement before the inspection started. 'It is much too early to assess these changes. 'However, some of the challenges Glen Parva faces are outside its direct control and the planned review of arrangements for holding young adults, and the current independent inquiry into recent self-inflicted deaths among this age group, need to proceed urgently.' Inspectors also found evidence of unofficial punishments being given, including restrictions to exercise periods, as well as some officers using 'offensive language'. Use of force was deemed too high with 379 incidents in the six months to the end of March, including the use of control and restraint techniques in almost two-thirds of incidents. Michael Spurr, chief executive of the National Offender Management Service (Noms), the executive agency of the Ministry of Justice that runs prisons in England and Wales, said: 'The challenges presented by the young men held at Glen Parva should not be underestimated and on occasions the prison has struggled to cope. 'The governor launched an improvement plan prior to this unannounced inspection and progress is being made. 'Safety is the governor's top priority and the YOI is now providing a safe and decent regime. 'We are reviewing future arrangements for young adult offenders in light of the wider concerns raised by the inspectorate.' Mr Hardwick told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme that Glen Parva 'wasn't safe' and described 'high levels of violence'. He added: 'That in turn was leading to self harm. We were very concerned about the dangers to the young men that were held there.' The chief inspector, who branded some of the conditions uncovered 'squalid and overcrowded', also said there had been some suicides. 'This prison is dangerous for teenagers and this sounds more like an extract from William Golding's Lord Of The Flies' Frances Crook, Howard League for Penal Reform . But he went on: 'There was a new management there. They had started to address some of these issues.' Asked what needed to happen now, Mr Hardwick replied: 'There are things they can do at a local level. 'But I think this is a national problem... The Government did a few months ago announce a review of these large young offender institutions, then that was halted while there is another review into deaths going on. 'I think they need to get on and work out how - with others - how best to keep these young men safe and how best to rehabilitate them so they don't come out of these places brutalised and more likely to commit offences than when they went in.'","Inspectors say Glen Parva, in Leicestershire, is not safe .

"Some friendships are just a bit more special than others. There is no doubt that the love between the late Sheila Marsh and her 25-year-old mare Bronwen was tender, warm and utterly reciprocated. They had been inseparable for a quarter of a century. Sheila, 77, had raised Bronwen from a foal to adulthood. She had schooled her, groomed her, fed her, taught her to jump and petted, cuddled, nuzzled and mothered her. Scroll down for video . Mrs Marsh, pictured with her horse Bronwen, who she had since she was a foal, riding at a local show . Final Goodbye: Sheila Marsh was reunited with her beloved horse, Bronwen, in the car park of Wigan Royal Infirmary hours before she lost her fight against cancer . Bronwen, in turn, was loving, kind, trustworthy and loyal. Which is why, when Sheila lay in hospital last week, beaten by cancer, she had three dying wishes. ‘She wanted to see her favourite horse Bronwen one last time,’ says her daughter Tina, 33. ‘She loved that horse with everything she had. Her other wishes were to see her dog Poddy, whom she had owned for 13 years. ‘And to see me and my father speaking again, because we hadn’t spoken for years.’ And so, as revealed in Saturday’s Daily Mail, the brilliant staff at Wigan Infirmary welcomed Poddy on to the foot of Sheila’s bed and set up a poignant equine farewell – arranging for Bronwen to be transported from Sheila’s farm in Bickershaw, Greater Manchester, and then wheeling her bed out into the crisp November air for a last goodbye. No one who witnessed the moment remained dry-eyed. Sheila, who could barely speak, whispered Bronwen’s name and asked for a kiss. Bronwen gently nuzzled her mistress on the cheek with a soft velvety nose. Sheila died hours later, early on Tuesday morning. Although terribly sad, it was also a wonderfully uplifting moment in a world often hobbled by ridiculous health and safety regulations and endless bureaucratic nonsenses. Mrs Marsh, who was passionate about horses and owned six others, pictured left in her prime. Bronwen stands alone, right . The photograph of their final moments was circulated on Twitter and Facebook and immediately went viral. Today, with Tina’s blessing, we bring you another picture of Sheila and Bronwen in happier times taking part in a show-jumping competition, and Tina and the glossy brown mare, pictured at the weekend, grieving but happy that Sheila is at peace. Sheila had always been an animal lover and owned six horses, three dogs and three cats at her death. ‘We always had animals around the house growing up. Mum loved animals and she even had her own riding school until she got married,’ says Tina. ‘She was so animal orientated, she loved them all, but horses were her pride and joy.’ The 77-year-old's dying wish was to see her horse of 25-years one final time before she lost her cancer battle . Tina Marsh, 33, said that taking Bronwen to see her mother was very important and it was a 'beautiful moment' Horses were Sheila’s life. She worked at Haydock Park Racecourse from the age of 21, first as race starter, then programme seller and later cleaning the parade ring. She had an exceptional eye for a champion, although she never gambled. According to all who knew her, she was kind, loving, hard-working, honest and caring. And terribly grateful to the staff of Wigan Infirmary. ‘Seeing Bronwen and Poddy was very important for my mum,’ says Tina. But even better, her third wish – that Tina and her father, Sheila’s ex-husband, would finally bury the hatchet – came true, too. On Monday, the day before mum passed away, we put our differences aside and spoke for the first time in years. ‘So all her dying wishes were granted,’ says Tina. ‘I was there when she died and I know she died happy.’ And what of beautiful, gentle Bronwen? ‘She will stay with me now,’ says Tina. ‘Bronwen’s still part of our family and having her will be like having a connection to mum.’ Staff at Wigan Royal Infirmary said they acted on the 'last wishes' of dying Sheila Marsh by arranging the final loving meeting with her horse .","Sheila Marsh said an emotional goodbye to her beloved horse Bronwen .

"The Swiss Army Knife was originally designed for soldiers who needed to survive in harsh conditions, but different sized blades are of limited use if you are trying to open an iPhone case or upload data onto your laptop.

The company claims the design is the first crowd-sourced tool and reflects the more improvisational approach to DIY that is popular in the 21st Century. To decide which elements were included in the tool, the Scandinavian hardware chain asked followers on Facebook and Twitter to suggest ingenious uses for everyday items. The firm said fans responded in droves . and it soon became apparent that even the most basic of household items . were being used in useful alternative ways, and it consequently made . sense to put them all together in a tool.

Here a paperclip is being used to open the SIM card compartment of an iPhone . In the company’s professional version, the tool's wooden casing is made of Swedish oak with rounded corners to hold the nine selected items, although people’s efforts at home might not look so polished. According to the blueprint, an elastic band can be fixed and housed to one of the ‘arms’ of the tool as the company said it is ‘inferior only to duct tape in its ability to hold things together and you can also place it around a paint tin to stop brush drips’. In the company's professional version pictured, the wooden casing of the tool is made of Swedish oak and beautifully rounded to hold the nine selected items .

The tool also incorporates a rubber thumbnail, a penny as a substitute screwdriver and a paperclip which is popularly used to hold cash together, temporarily repair the hems of skirts and take micro SIM cards out of phones.

Similarly to some Swiss Army Knives, the tool includes a bottle opener but it also proves it is a tool for modern men and women by including a USB memory stick that holds 8GB of information. While the creation of the tool might be a fun project, the hardware store told MailOnline the components come in at just under £26.83 for one device, although some of the components have to be bought in bulk so it could prove as much as £79.99.

"Not even losing a limb can dampen the spirits of 'Sydney's Happiest Amputee' - Mathew McHugh. It has only been three months since the keen paraglider lost his left leg after crashing into a cliff at the headland between Monavale beach and Warriewood in the Northern Beaches. And the good-humoured 32-year-old could not wait to capture his first night out to dinner in his wheelchair with friends on video. Scroll down for video . Mathew McHugh, (pictured on his birthday in May), is so grateful about surviving the accident that he calls himself 'Sydney's Happiest Amputee' Mr McHugh, (pictured in hospital with his friends on his birthday last month), captured on video his first night out since the accident three months ago, and declared: 'This is the first night of freedom in my new life.' He had a paragliding accident on April 2 and had to have his left leg amputated so he is raising funds for his ongoing physio and for a prosthetic leg . ‘This is the first night of freedom in my new life,’ a cheerful Mr McHugh says to the camera before adding; ‘Well, I get three hours of release from my rehabilitation centre.’ ‘It was a great night out,’ Mr McHugh told 9 Stories. ‘It felt amazing to be out there and given a second chance, really amazing.’ Proudly taking on the title of 'Sydney's Happiest Amputee', Mr McHugh’s positive attitude is nothing short of inspirational. ‘I'm just happy to be alive,’ Mr Mchugh said. ‘I actually get more upset about being woken up at midnight for a tablet than the accident itself.’ Mr McHugh's infectious happy-go-lucky attitude has struck a chord with the public. A fund set up to help cover the cost of his medical bills has already surpassed the $7,000 goal, prompting his family to set up a new fund to help with the ongoing costs of prosthesis. ‘This week I'm getting the first initial part of my leg, but the costs are going to be quite consistent, so any small change that someone can drop into the bucket will help,’ he said. Mr McHugh with friends one month before the paragliding accident where he lost his left leg . Mr McHugh credits his positive outlook to the ongoing support he has received not only from his family and friends, but also from the rescuers and the team at the Graythwaite Rehabilitation Centre in Ryde. ‘First thing I said to my family when I woke up was; “I'm here, oh cool, awesome”,’ Mr McHugh said. ‘Then I looked down and saw the leg and told my family “oh it'll grow back” – they thought I was being serious and that the hospital drugs must’ve gotten to me.’ ‘I can't go back and change time. I've been given a second chance at life, that's the way I look at it,’ he said. ‘Sure, I've lost a bit of a leg but I've been given a second life.’ Looking ahead, Mr McHugh now plans to pay the charity forward, and hopes to one day use his message to raise funds for other amputees. ‘It's like a circle of life,’ he said. ‘I can't wait for the moment that I can walk right into the room of the people that saved me and shake their hands. That will be amazing.’ To donate to Mathew McHugh's fund click here.","'Sydney's happiest amputee' has captured on video his first outing since losing his leg in a paragliding accident in April .

"An adopted man's book - in which he claims he discovered that his biological father was the Zodiac killer - is set to be published on Tuesday. Details of the book, called The Most Dangerous Animal of All, were hidden by 'dozens' of staff at publisher HarperCollins, according to a report by New York Magazine. Son of a killer? Gary Stewart, pictured, claims in a new book that his biological father was the Zodiac killer . Is this Stewart's father? A publicist for the upcoming book says the father's mugshot bears a 'strong resemblance' to the police sketch of the Zodiac killer . Writer Gary Stewart, who wrote the book alongside crime author Susan Mustafa, realized his father's true identity 'after twelve years of research,' HarperCollins publicist Tina Andreadis told New York. Stewart, according to the book's description, looked for his father after his birth mother contacted him for the first time ever. It claims that 'forensic evidence' helped show his father was responsible for the Zodiac crimes. The book, Andreadis told New York, was found to be 'legally sound' by HarperCollins' lawyers - though she admitted that the publisher did not contact the San Francisco Police Department for review, who she said 'knew more than they're willing to admit.' Never found: Law enforcement officers from two Bay Area counties and San Francisco met in San Francisco are seen in this Oct. 20, 1969 file photo comparing notes regarding the search for the Zodiac killer . Victims: From left are San Francisco cab driver Paul Stine, who was shot to death, Cecilia Shepard, 22, a student who was stabbed to death, and Bryan Hartnell, 20, who was stabbed but survived . The Zodiac killer killed at least five people and injured two more between 1968 and 1969 in the San Francisco Bay Area. The killer sent cryptograms to media outlets, some of which remain unsolved. Stewart's father has a criminal record and his mug shot resembles the Zodiac Killer's police sketch, Andreadis told New York. 'If you look at Gary’s photo next to the sketch of the Zodiac next to his father’s mug shot, you can see that there is very clearly more than just a passing resemblance,' she told the magazine. 'They look alike.' 'He didn’t want to believe,' she added. 'I don’t think most people want to know that their father is a notorious serial killer.'

"Sales of a smartphone game whose goal is to wipe out the human race with a deadly disease have shot up as Ebola dominates global headlines. Users' morbid fascination with the outbreak gained Plague Inc almost a million extra players in two weeks - a period which saw the death toll pass 4,000 and new infections in the U.S. and Spain.

Choose your weapon: Players can choose bacteria, a virus, a fungus, a parasite or a 'bio-weapon' The game can produce messages such as: 'Victory! Ebola has successfully eliminated all life on Earth' Players infect a ‘Patient Zero’ before working to evolve their pathogen, which they can give a name of their choice. As they win ‘DNA points’, players can add symptoms like cysts and tumours while making their virus more contagious and immune to modern drugs. They can choose a world where no one washes their hands - or one where many countries have state-of-the-art hospital care. Now tens of thousands of players are highlighting the grim comparison with Ebola, with many even naming their imaginary disease after the virus.

The game was already popular long before recent headlines over the outbreak, said Mr Vaughan, but it had a sharp rise in use in the last few weeks. Last week more than 430,000 new players downloaded the app, he told MailOnline - a rise of 147,000, more than 50 per cent, on the same figure two weeks earlier. The total number of players last week was almost 4million - a rise of 923,000 on the figure two weeks before that. The app's ability to auto-post to Twitter had led to messages many would think distasteful - such as: 'My virus, called Ebola, just wiped out the world in 544 days!'. Another declared: 'Victory! Ebola has successfully eliminated all life on Earth'. Several players have joked about fleeing to Greenland while one Twitter user, @GreerSimms, wrote: 'Ebola is just the real life version of Plague Inc'. But the entrepreneur insists the app can be a force for good, and is now in talks with charities about putting some of the proceeds towards victims. Deadly: While the game is free on Android, iPhone users can pay to genetically mutate their deadly pathogen . Bonus: Players who do well can give their virus symptoms such as cysts, tumours and total organ failure . 'There will be people queuing up to say it's a cash grab, and that couldn't be further from the truth', Mr Vaughan told MailOnline. 'It would be infinitely better if the Ebola outbreak had never happened at all, but I want to use the position that Plague Inc has to try and help in whatever way I can.' Mr Vaughan has fans in high places - including the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the body in charge of containing the Ebola cases in Dallas and New York. He was invited last year to help CDC staff with their public awareness campaigns, with CDC director Ali S Khan claiming the game 'creates a compelling world that engages the public on serious public health topics.’ Economics graduate Mr Vaughan said he is now in 'detailed' talks with major charities about giving away some of the game's profits towards the Western effort to contain the disease. His firm, Ndemic Creations, has not published its profits but has an office near London Bridge and seven staff around the world. The app is free for Android users while costing 99p for iPhone users, alongside 'top-up' charges to unlock advanced features of the game such as genetic mutations to their disease’s DNA. Mr Vaughan said the game's popularity since 2012 has built a 'very solid foundation' financially but added: 'Ebola has not had a significant impact on revenues – the majority of our downloads come from Android'. ‘This hasn’t been the biggest increase we’ve had in our downloads in 2014 but I think this is the first time a real world situation has been the reason why people are getting the game,' he said. Meanwhile in West Africa: Oxfam worker Holly Taylor with community health worker Mary Kamara in Freetown . Hopes: The first shipment of the experimental vaccine VSE-EBOV, which arrived at a Geneva hospital this week . 'Players are often interested in real-world issues, and frequently discuss diseases and the science behind them. Recently, we have seen that tens of thousands of Plague Inc players are talking about Ebola on game forums and social media. 'They mention how scary it is to see things they have learnt from Plague Inc being talked about on the news or how seeing a disease simulation on a map reminds them of the game. 'People may see Plague Inc as a dark game, but that is because it focuses on very serious real world issues and makes people think about them. It holds a mirror up to the world and shows the player the true horror of diseases like Ebola and why we must do everything we can to stop them.' Of the West's response to the outbreak, he added: 'We should have been doing more months and months ago.' The death toll from the outbreak - which started ten months ago - now stands at 4,877. Western coverage has been particularly intense in the last month after the first fresh infections outside Africa, in Spain and the U.S. Warnings from health bodies have also become more stark as the death toll, which until early August remained below 1,000, has ramped up. There have now been 9,936 probable, suspected and confirmed cases of Ebola, mostly in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, with transmission in some areas remaining 'intense'. World Health Organisation (WHO) figures suggest the real death toll could be as high as 15,000.","Plague Inc's users infect a 'Patient Zero' before trying to kill off the world .

"This German police worker, known only Detlev G, has been arrested on suspicion of murdering a man who fantasised about being eaten by a cannibal . A German police worker has been charged with murdering and chopping up a man he met on a cannibal website who had long fantasised about being killed and eaten. The suspect, known only as Detlev G, is said to have been 'obsessed' with cannibalism and met the 59-year-old man from Hanover on the fetishist website. Police say the victim was tortured, killed and dismembered and body parts were found buried in the garden of Detlev's home in the eastern Ore Mountains, near Dresden. The handwriting and document analysis . specialist was arrested on Wednesday at his workplace, the Criminal . Technical Institute in the eastern city of Dresden, authorities said. He . told investigators that he fatally stabbed the victim in the throat on . November 4, hours after the two met in person for the first time. The 55-year-old said he then chopped up the body into multiple pieces. The . suspect pointed officers to a number of places around his property, . south of Dresden, where he had buried the remains, city police chief . Dieter Kroll said at a televised news conference. The 59-year-old victim, whose name was not released, traveled about 250 miles by bus from Hanover to the meeting. Scroll down for video . The police worker allegedly buried his 59-year-old victim in the garden of his home near Dresden (pictured) Police search around the property in eastern Germany and are investigating if any body parts were eaten . Police started looking into the case when the victim was reported missing on November 11 by a colleague. Two days later, witnesses told officers that 'the missing man had fantasised since his youth about being killed and eaten by another person,' Kroll said. The killing happened about a month after the pair first met in an Internet chatroom, police said. 'The victim had been fantasising . about being killed and eaten by someone else since his youth,' Dresden . police chief Dieter Kroll told a news conference. Authorities are now checking whether any body parts are missing or were eaten but the suspect has denied doing so. The website they used says it deals with . 'exotic meat.' The victim travelled 250 miles to the house in Hanover for the meeting and was killed within hours . Police President Dieter Kroll (left) and public prosecutor Erich Wenzlick (right) told reporters today they are treating the case as murder and believe a portion of the victim was eaten . 'He said that his victim wanted to be killed and he fulfilled this wish,' Haase said in a telephone interview. The case has similarities to that of . Armin Meiwes, who was jailed in 2002 for meeting, killing and eating a . computer programmer from Berlin whose life's ambition was to be eaten. Investigator Maik Mainda said the . victim and the suspected killer maintained 'very intense contact by . chat, by mail, by SMS but also by telephone' after first becoming . acquainted in early October. Police are only just beginning their investigation, he said. 'I can't give any conclusive . information yet about the actual motivation of the suspect for killing . his victim. We are investigating in all directions.' German media reported that Detlev was previously married but divorced and then started a relationship with a man. Case mirrors that of Armin Meiwes (left) who was jailed for killing, dismembering and eating Bernd Brandes . Prosecutors said the suspect did not mention whether he and the victim had any sexual relations before the killing. The Dresden case 'will show how . easily people can come together with the most gruesome fantasies on the . Internet and exchange their perversions in increasingly crass manner,' police chief Kroll said. 'In 99 per cent of cases, they get their kick out of the exchange.' His former wife is also employed by the state criminal investigation office. In the case of the victim, it seemed his desires mirrored those of Bernd Brandes, the computer programmer who was dismembered and eaten by Meiwes at his home near Kassel in 2001.","Suspect known as Detlev G said to be 'obsessed' with cannibalism .

"Kristine Hewlett was flung from nine-year-old mare Cher (pictured) in November and suffered a spinal fracture but she has vowed to ride again . A horse rider has vowed to get back in the saddle despite breaking her spine twice in two years after being thrown from the same mare. Kristine Hewlett, 25, fell off her nine-year-old Cher, when the animal bucked during a riding lesson. She was airlifted to hospital on November 30 where it was confirmed she had suffered a L1 fracture of the spine - a similar injury she had suffered after falling off Cher in 2011. It is the second time she has suffered serious injuries when she took Cher out for a ride. The 16.2 hand horse, a thorough-bred cross Cleveland Bay, is looked after at the White Horse Equine Centre, near Daventry, Northants. Kristine, who lives with her parents near the equine centre, said: 'We were doing some work without the stirrups and my horse went into canter and I panicked, which made her panic and we ended up doing, quite literally, the wall of death. 'I was pretty badly winded. I lay there for a couple of minutes and tried to get up but I couldn’t. 'We phoned for an ambulance but we were then called back to ask if there was a field for the air ambulance to land in. 'I think most people would rather not be strapped down on a board and flown to hospital. 'Since my first accident I have had to ride slightly differently and I am heavy on my right side so my balance isn’t as good. 'I could feel I was going to fall off and we were going flat out so probably travelling at about 25mph. 'Onlookers said I landed on my head and then flipped over and was then in heap. 'I was conscious so I remember it. I thought I had done my pelvis so I was just really nervous not knowing what injuries I had. I had so much adrenaline I don’t think the pain set in at first. Kristine, pictured riding Cher, had to be airlifted to hospital after the 25mph fall . Kristine, pictured on the day of the accident, said she will get back in the saddle but will not ride Cher again after breaking her back twice in separate falls in two years . 'My hat was in pieces so it really shows how important it is to wear a hat while riding. 'I just remember thinking I have got to get up, this can’t be happening again but my body just wouldn’t move. 'I won’t be riding Cher again which is sad but a friend of mine will be looking after her.' Kristine returned home from hospital on December 2 and now needs to remain flat for 22 hours a day for six weeks to help her fracture recover. She first broke her spine on July 27, 2011 when Cher, who weighs 70 stone, rolled on top of her before standing on her leg. The graphic designer spent eight months undergoing intense physiotherapy before she recovered enough to carry on riding. But despite her second scare she has vowed to carry on riding. She said: 'I have thought long and hard about my future but I love horses and I want to carry on taking lessons.' The equine centre declined to comment about Kristine’s accident.","Kristine Hewlett flung from horse Cher suffering L1 spinal fracture .

"At least 18 people suffered horrible burns and a petrol bomb was thrown into a crowded moving bus today in Bangladesh. Passengers were forced to jump from the windows - some burning in flames - as the bus veered off the road and crashed into an electric poll in the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka, police said. At least ten people have 40 per cent burns to their bodies and some are in a critical condition in hospital. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Witnesses said some passengers were on fire as they jumped from the windows of the bus after a petrol bomb was thrown at it in Dhaka . Police believe the petrol bomb was thrown by a supporter of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party which has called for protests against planned elections in January . At least 18 people have been burned in the attack that completely gutted the bus . It comes amid escalating violence in the country as people protest against elections scheduled for January. It is believed the petrol bomb was thrown by a supporter of the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party, which has called for a blockade of roads, waterways and railways across the country. Rickshaw driver Fara Ali, who saw the burning bus, said: 'I carried four passengers in my rickshaw. 'Their clothes, skin and parts of their heads were in flames. It was such a terrible scene.' Assistant police commissioner Shibly Noman said at least 17 passengers and the bus driver were admitted to the Dhaka Medical College Hospital with different degrees of burn injuries. A Bangladeshi patient who suffered burns in the attack is taken to the Dhaka Medical College . Witnesses say passengers' clothes , skin and even heads were on fire as they tried to escape the burning bus .

But we suspect this is an act by opposition . supporters,' he said. Passenger Sushmita Sen, who burnt both her hands, said: 'I saw a flame in the bus and then I passed out. I woke up to find me and my mother in hospital beds.' Pictures show the single-deck bus was gutted in the attack. Samanto Lal Sen, head of the hospital's burn unit, said the ward was overwhelmed with victims from the attack. He told AFP: 'At least ten passengers have 40 per cent of their bodies burnt. Their conditions are critical.' Bangladeshi doctors treat patients who sustained burn injuries in the crowded bus . Bangladeshi commuters leave from a train during an ongoing blockade organised by Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) activists and its Islamist allies in Dhaka . The burnt passengers were the latest victims of the country's deadly protests over the government's plans to hold a general election on January 5. At least 15 people have been killed and hundreds injured since Monday night, after an 18-party opposition alliance led by the BNP called for a nationwide protest against the election date. The BNP has demanded a suspension of the poll and the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina as well as elections under a neutral caretaker government - demands that Hasina has bluntly rejected. Hasina formed a caretaker administration this month involving members of the ruling party and opposition to oversee the polls. However, the BNP says it is not impartial.","Doctors said some patients suffered 40 per cent burns in the attack .

She said the 2ft-tall pooch had looked like a ‘former aristocratic drag queen who fell on hard times’. The artist's fascination with animal artwork began in her childhood when she assigned detailed human profiles to her pets based on their looks, behaviours and habits. She added: 'Artists trying to show the extraordinary qualities in things other people may dismiss or dispose of is nothing new - I'm just applying it to stray and otherwise unwanted animals.'

"As the saying goes, you're much more likely to die in a car wreck on the way to the airport than you are to die in a horrific plane crash. That saying is especially true for Australia-based Qantas Airlines, which was named the safest airline in the world by AirlineRatings.com. The aviation industry website notes Qantas' impressive record when it comes to its total number of fatal plane crashes in what it calls the 'jet era,' which it describes as being from 1951 to the present. In the time period, Qantas has had precisely zero fatal plane crashes - a fact made famous in the 1988 film Rain Man, in which Dustin Hoffman's character, Raymond Babbitt, refuses to fly on any airline other than Qantas because of its stellar safety record. Safety First: Qantas is the safest airline in the world after not having a single fatal crash in more than 60 years . Pop Culture: Qantas became a household name in America when it was mentioned in the Academy Award-winning film Rain Man . The website lists 10 airlines that it considers the safest - and that, like Qantas, have a seven-star rating for safety and in-flight product. In addition to Qantas, the website lists Air New Zealand, All Nippon Airways, Cathay Pacific Airways, Emirates, . Etihad Airways, Eva Air, Royal Jordanian, Singapore Airlines and Virgin . Atlantic as the 10 safest airlines in the world. No U.S.-based airlines made it into the top 10. The website also ranked the least safe airlines, most of which are based in Asia. According to the rankings, the Kazakh airline Scat, Afghan airline Kam Air and the Surinamese Bluewing Airline each have only a one-star rating. Banned: Afghan airline Kam Air is one of the least safe airlines on earth and is banned from flying in the EU . Bluewing and Kam Air are amongst a number of airlines banned from operating in the European Union. Despite a few bad apples, fear not - the airline industry is one of the safest industries in the world, much due to the fact that it is so heavily monitored. As the website notes, most airlines go years without experiencing a major safety incident. Additionally, the number of air-travel fatalities was at a record low, according to the Aviation Safety Network. In other words, there often is little to distinguish the safest, most reliable carriers from others that may have encountered an incident. And according to the survey, 137 of the 448 airlines the website reviewed have a seven-star safety rating.","Qantas hasn't had a fatal crash during the entire 'Jet Era,' which began in 1951 .

"Argentina has threatened oil firms seeking to operate off the Falkland Islands with 15-year jail terms, huge fines and confiscation of assets in the latest installment of its dispute with Britain over sovereignty. Its London embassy announced that new laws have been passed by the Argentine Congress to punish exploration it claims is in breach of a United Nations resolution. But the Foreign Office insisted the activities were 'wholly legitimate and legal' and entirely under the control of the Government of the island - a British overseas territory. Argentina has announced new laws preventing oil firms from operating off the Falkland Islands . Royal Navy ship HMS Montrose on patrol near Stanley Harbour. The British says it works within international law and operations are 'wholly legitimate and legal' Islanders voted by 1,513 to three to remain a British overseas territory in a referendum in March but Argentina has since stepped up its claim over the territory at the United Nations. Buenos Aires has issued repeated written legal warnings to firms that they face administrative, civil and criminal action for operating off the islands - which Argentina calls Las Malvinas. The embassy said in a statement that the law includes 15-year prison sentences and fines equivalent to the value of 1.5million barrels of oil. It added that the law provides for the banning of individuals and companies from operating in Argentina and the confiscation of equipment. 'The Argentine Government has protested . against and rejected all of the United Kingdom's attempts to promote and . authorize such hydrocarbon exploration and exploitation activities in . the area of the Argentine continental shelf,' it said. Argentina president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner has upped her rhetoric against Britain over the past year . 'These attempts are manifestly contrary to Resolution 31/49 of the United Nations General Assembly, which requires the UK and Argentina to refrain from taking decisions that would imply introducing unilateral modifications into the situation of the Malvinas Islands while the sovereignty dispute between the two countries is still pending.' Argentina president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner has upped her rhetoric over the Falklands Islands over the past year. At a UN Security Council meeting she compared the dispute over the islands to the Israel-Palestine conflict. A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'Hydrocarbons activities by any company operating on the continental shelf of the Falkland Islands are regulated by legislation of the Falkland Islands Government, in strict accordance with the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea. 'As such these activities are wholly legitimate and legal. 'The UK Government unequivocally supports the right of the Falkland Islanders to develop their natural resources for their own economic benefit. 'This right is an integral part of their right of self-determination, which is expressly contained in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

"Roland Wright was today convicted of abusing five boys while he worked at Caldicott Prep School in the 1950s and 60s . Nick Clegg’s former headmaster was facing jail yesterday after being  convicted of sexually abusing pupils over a decade at one of England’s leading prep schools. Roland Peter Wright molested five young boys at Caldicott Prep School after luring them to his room to watch television and drink whiskey in his bed. He taught French and sport at the all-boy school and targeted older pupils, aged 12 to 13, who were gifted athletes. Now the 83-year-old paedophile faces jail after being found guilty on 10 counts of indecent assault and two counts of indecency with a child between 1959 and 1970 at Aylesbury Crown Court. Wright was headmaster of the prestigious school – which is a  popular ‘feeder’ school for Eton and Harrow and charges annual fees  of £20,000 – for 25 years, retiring  in 1993. The Deputy Prime Minister spent five years at the Buckinghamshire school from 1975, several years after the abuse occurred. Wright - also known by his middle name Peter - will be sentenced at a later date. The offences on boys aged between eight and 13 spanned from September 1959 to August 1970. The jury heard how Wright ran the school’s rugby team and would choose a favourite child who would be given rides in his sports car. He would also invite them to his bedsit to watch television and drink whisky. The trial heard Wright would invite children into his room where they would be abused. One former pupil said in evidence at the trial in Amersham, Buckinghamshire, that Wright created an atmosphere where boys wanted to please him. 'Boys like me and a lot of others fell for Peter Wright. We had a crush on him,' he said. 'What we wanted was his approval.' Hugh Henry, another teaching contemporary of Wright’s at the school, in Farnham Royal, Buckinghamshire, tried to commit suicide by taking an overdose after being caught in a boy’s bed back in the 60s. He has already admitted a number of offences and also falls to be sentenced. The deputy Prime Minister spent five years at Caldicott from 1975, and was not a pupil at the time of the abuse. The jury heard how Wright would choose a favourite child who would be given rides in his sports car and invited into his room . The other teachers at Caldicott Prep School have been convicted of child sex offences . Wright became headmaster in 1968 after already being at the school for a decade, and retired in 1993. Fellow teachers John Addrison, Edward Carson and Hugh Henry were also previously convicted of child sexual offences at the school. The Crown Prosecution Service said today Wright and the other teachers' position of responsibility increased the seriousness of the crimes. Ruth Bowskill, the temporary Chief Crown Prosecutor for Thames and Chiltern area, said: 'This case marks the end of a series of prosecutions of four teaching staff involved in the serious sexual abuse of a number of children at Caldicott school in Buckinghamshire committed over a period of a decade. 'The position of trust held by these men, the young age of the victims and their vulnerability at the time of the abuse greatly increases the seriousness of these already grave offences. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg was a pupil at the school for five years from 1975 and was not a pupil at the time of the abuse . 'Roland Peter Wright was a particularly trusted member of staff at Caldicott school and became the headteacher. 'Not only did he breach the trust of the pupils at the school, their parents and the staff, Wright also abused his position of authority in order to gain access to his victims.' She commended the former pupils for their determination, adding: 'It is only due to the great courage and persistence of the victims and those affected by the abuse that the despicable behaviour of these teachers at the school has been exposed. 'Roland Peter Wright has never shown any contrition for his behaviour or apologised for his conduct; at all times he has sought to evade responsibility for what he did. 'I would like to pay tribute to the victims and witnesses in this case for their strength and tenacity in coming forward and giving evidence on matters which must have been extremely distressing still years after the events took place. 'The emotional impact on Wright's victims and those of the other teachers is impossible to quantify. 'I hope that the convictions give some small comfort to the victims involved.'","Roland Wright molested children at Caldicott Prep School in 1950s and 60s .

"A masked robber, who sexually assaulted a woman in her bed after climbing through an open window, was caught when police traced him using an app on her stolen phone. Police arrested Raymond Yates, 31, within an hour of the break-in using a tracking app on one of two mobile phones he stole and he was today convicted of robbery and sexual assault. He had been filmed casing . the property on a CCTV camera at the front door before he tied a T-shirt over his face and opened her window. Scroll down for video . Raymond Yates was filmed on a CCTV camera casing the property before climbing in through an open window and sexually assaulting a woman in her bed . Shameless: After checking the window was open, he took off his shoes and tied a T-shirt over his face to try and conceal his identity . The woman, who was sleeping alone in the . room, woke to find him straddling her and pinning her to the bed. He then threatened to kill her if she screamed for help. Yates, of no fixed address, was also convicted of trespass with intent to commit a sexual offence following a trial at Woolwich Crown Court today. Yates was captured on the static CCTV camera wrapping a T-shirt around his face to try to conceal his identity before casually climbing through the window of the property in Forest Hill, south east London, at about 5am on July 25. Moments earlier he had been seen casing the property and putting his head through the window. He also had no shoes on to lessen the chances of him being heard as he approached. Yates then sexually assaulted the woman and threatened to kill her if she made a sound. He was today convicted of robbery and sexual assault after being traced by police using a security app on one of the victim's phones that he stole . He fled through the same window having stolen two mobile phones at about 5am. The attack lasted about a minute. He was arrested on board a bus in Brixton Hill just an hour after the incident, after police traced him using the security app. He still had the phones still on him. Detectives said the amount of planning Yates had put into the crime showed he was a 'committed criminal' Detective Constable Corrado Di Mascio of the Metropolitan Police's Sapphire Unit, part of the Sexual Offences, Exploitation and Child Abuse Command, who led the investigation, said: 'This was a particularly harrowing attack on a lone woman whilst she slept in her bed at home. 'The evidence shows that Yates was . calculating in his attack, concealing his identity and taking off his . shoes in an attempt to mask his approach. 'I would like to praise the victim who has been committed to seeing her attacker brought to justice.' Detective . Chief Inspector Pete Thomas, also of Sapphire, added: 'The level of . planning and thought Yates demonstrated while carrying out this offence . shows he is a committed offender. 'While . we have no concrete evidence of other offences we cannot discount the . possibility that Yates may have carried out other attacks. 'If . you believe you have been the victim of this man, please contact . police. Sapphire have specially trained officers who will support you . and strive to obtain justice for you.' Yates will be sentenced at a later date.","Raymond Yates seen on CCTV climbing through window .

"The Queen will not attend Nelson . Mandela's funeral after being advised to scale back on long haul . travel but send the Prince of Wales instead, it was confirmed today. Buckingham Palace said Prince Charles will represent the British monarchy at the memorial events in South Africa commemorating the Nobel Peace Prize-winner's life. Prime Minister David Cameron said on Twitter today he will also fly out for the service. The Queen, meanwhile, is expected to pay tribute to the revered statesman at a service at Westminster . Abbey, after reluctantly making the decision not to fly to South Africa. The Queen will pay tribute to Nelson Mandela at a Westminster Abbey service in the New Year but it is believed she will not attend his funeral after taking advice about scaling back long haul travel . Iconic funeral: Anti-apartheid hero Nelson Mandela will lie in state for several days next week before a massive funeral service that will draw numerous heads of state and celebrities . Charles, who has made several visits to South Africa, is understood to have sent a private letter of condolence to Mr Mandela's widow Graca Machel following his death last week. The Duchess of Cornwall will not be accompanying him to the funeral, a Clarence House spokeswoman said. Mr Cameron wrote on Twitter: 'I'll be at the memorial service in South Africa on Tuesday to commemorate the great man. #RIPMandela.' The official memorial service will take place at the FNB Stadium in Johannesburg, the South African government said. A message on the government website said it would be attended by members of the public as well as heads of state. 'This will give ordinary people and public leaders an opportunity to celebrate Madiba's life collectively,' they said in the statement, using the clan name Mr Mandela was affectionately known by. The public will have a chance to say goodbye to their beloved father figure during a memorial service at the Johannesburg soccer stadium (above) that hosted the 2010 World Cup . A state funeral will be held days . later, with the South African government saying 'a funeral service and . interment ceremony will take place at President Mandela's home and final . resting place at Qunu in the Eastern Cape.' A . national service of thanksgiving for the life of Mr Mandela will be . held after the state funeral on Sunday - the first ceremony of its kind . at the Abbey for a non-British citizen. A book of condolence has also opened at St Margaret's Church at the Abbey. Three American presidents will attend memorial services for Mr Mandela this week, alongside an estimated 140 heads of state. The Queen . discussed plans for the ceremony to Mr Mandela as early as June, according to The . People. She is also believed to have telephoned him a number of times since he was taken seriously ill in the summer. The pair had a strong relationship and Queen Elizabeth first met Mr Mandela in 1991 and received him again in 1996. During the state visit, the South African president called her 'this gracious lady' and she also praised 'this wonderful man'. Fitting location: Mandela's body is expected to lie in state in the Union Buildings in Pretoria (above) where he was inaugurated as President . A statement from . Buckingham Palace said after his death was announced on Thursday: 'The . Queen was deeply saddened to learn of the death of Nelson Mandela last . night. 'He worked tirelessly for the good of his country, and his legacy is the peaceful South Africa we see today. 'Her . Majesty remembers with great warmth her meetings with Mr Mandela and . sends her sincere condolences to his family and the people of South . Africa at this very sad time.' The memorial, expected to last ten days, will be an unparalleled event in South Africa’s history. The . White House said President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama . would be joined on Air Force One next week by former president George . Bush and his wife Laura. A Bush spokesman said the couple 'gratefully accepted' the invitation from the Obamas. Bill . Clinton is also travelling to South Africa, along with his wife, former . secretary of state Hillary Clinton, but it was unclear whether they . would also fly on Air Force One. Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama will be joined on Air Force One next week by former president George Bush . Former President Bill Clinton is also set to attend the state funeral and will be joined by Hilary Clinton . Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, who met with then-94-year-old Mandela last August, will also journey to South Africa . 'My whole family will be there,' Mr Clinton said. 'And we're looking forward to having the chance to say goodbye one last time.' President . Obama also invited 89-year-old George Bush senior to travel with him to . South Africa, but a spokesman for the former president said he would . not be able to make the trip. A . memorial service for Mr Mandela, 95, will be held . on Tuesday at a stadium in Johannesburg, followed by a smaller funeral . in his home town. Desmond Tutu, a long-time friend of Mr . Mandela and former archbishop of Cape Town is expected to hold the . service and David Cameron will also attend. Religious leaders such as Pope Francis and the Dalai Lama are also expected to attend the services. A host of celebrities who had personal ties to the great leader are also expected to travel to South Africa. Naomi . Campbell, who said Mr Mandela was her 'honorary grandfather, U2's Bono, Oprah Winfrey, and Bill Gates, who has campaigned for AIDs awareness in Africa, are . likely to attend the memorials. Preparations for the funeral are expected to bring the country of 53 million to a virtual standstill. The . sheer number of dignitaries, including numerous heads of state, is sure . to spell a logistical nightmare for the South African government, which . will be tasked with providing air-tight security during the solemn . event. Representing Britain: Prime Minister David Cameron and his wife Samantha, seen with Mandela at a photo shoot for his 90th birthday in London, will pay their respects . Giving thanks: All living former US leaders, including George W. Bush, pictured meeting Mandela in 2001, have been invited . Those planning Mr Mandela's funeral include the former president's family, the federal government, the military and the African National Congress party. Despite some prior planning by authorities as Mr Mandela grew frail and suffered bouts of hospitalisation in recent years, many of the details remain up in the air. It is unclear which ceremony world leaders will attend, either Tuesday's stadium memorial or the planned funeral service on December 15 in Qunu, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate's rural hometown in Eastern Cape Province. His body will rest in state on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday at the Union Buildings in Pretoria, the seat of government power in South Africa's capital. Mourners will walk up the steps into the Union Buildings' amphitheatre and file past Mr Mandela's body. ANC members will hold a ceremony on December 14 at Waterkloof Air Force Base near Pretoria before Mr Mandela's body is flown to Qunu from there, Mr Chabane added. Sunday has been declared a national day of prayer and reflection over Mr Mandela's death.

"A gangster jailed life for murder has been accused of a razor blade attack on two prison wardens just months after referring to himself as a 'laid back guy' on a pen pal website for inmates. Clifton Jeter, 36, is currently housed at HMP Manchester after he was jailed in 2008 for the murder of a father-of-seven during a bungled a 'honey trap' robbery. Jeter was born in Britain and taken to . the U.S. as a child but had been deported back to the UK after he became . involved with some of New York’s toughest street gangs and was . convicted of attempted robbery and intimidation. In prison, he has set up a profile page on an American website, which helps inmates find pen friends online and he complained of the need to find companionship. Convicted murderer Clifton Jeter has been accused of attacking two prison wardens in which one was slashed on the back of the neck (pictured) at HMP Manchester . In his entry Jeter said: 'It’s also hard to make friends in here - I’m a laid back guy. I love to have stimulating conversations.' He is considered the prime suspect in the attack on two prison wardens, according to the Manchester Evening News. The two wardens were slashed with a makeshift weapon made out of a razor blade melted into the head of a toothbrush while they escorted inmates to a segregation unit. New York gangster Jeter (pictured) has posted a profile on a website for prison inmates, complaining he is 'lonely' One of the warders needed stitches after . being left with a five-inch gash across the back of his neck. The other . officer suffered cuts to his face, arm and leg. Both work at HMP Manchester, formally known as Strangeways. It is believed the weapon was hidden in a shower room. Both casualties have since been sent home from hospital. The attacks came two years after Jeter was accused of punching one guard and grappling with another at Frankland jail in Durham while being escorted to his cell. Today, officials from the Prison Service were investigating the latest double attack but declined to give details. In 2002, he was jailed in the UK for seven years for aggravated burglary after raiding a hotel room and holding a man at gunpoint until he handed over his cash credit cards. Then in 2007 he was arrested for murder after chauffeur Ghiass Tarabin, who was stabbed to death during a bungled 'honey trap' robbery at his home in West Hendon. The court had been told Mr Tarabin had previously had sex with Jeter's girlfriend Candy. When she turned up at his house, Mr Tarabin let her in but Jeter was with her and demanded cash and valuables. Jeter's profile on Inmate-Connection states that he misses being able to 'socialize and mingle' There was a struggle and Mr Tarabin was stabbed once in the chest and collapsed in his garden where he died from massive blood loss. Jeter was convicted of murder in May 2008 at the Old Bailey and shouted: ‘F*** you' and other sexual expletives at the jury was he was led to the cells. During his stay at HMP Woodhill in Milton Keynes, Jeter attempted to reach out to 'new friends' after setting up an online profile on specialist site Inmate Connection. His profile acknowledges that he is a murderer with no release date but says he wants to make new friends. Alongside a profile photo of Jeter, it reads: 'I’m Clifton. I’m interested in meeting some friends. Prison can be a lonely place. It’s also hard to make friends in here. The two prison wardens were attacked at HMP Manchester, formally Strangeways, as they escorted inmates . 'I miss being able to socialize and mingle so hopefully I’ll be able to meet some people that I can keep in contact with. 'I’m a laid back guy. I love to have stimulating conversations. I’m very athletic; it’s what gets me through my sentence, that and reading books. Anyway, I hope to hear from some of you guys. Take care, Clifton.' The online ad was placed in December last year and runs out next week. It is believed the two Manchester prison officers were attacked from behind and the incident is believed to have been caught on CCTV. A picture of a wound has been posted on social media networks. It is understood Jeter has been transferred out of Manchester to another high-security prison. No one has been arrested in connection with the attack. Steve Gillan, general secretary of the Prison Officers Association said: 'This was a vicious cowardly attack on two prison officers in the execution of their duties. The Prison Officers' Association says attacks on wardens is rising and demanded it is taken seriously by the CPS . 'We would expect the Crown Prosecution Service to be applying the full weight of the law in charging the perpetrators of this extreme assault. 'The POA is acutely aware that serious assaults on staff are on the increase and that the relevant authorities, the National Offender Management Service, and the CPS, need to be making sure that prison officers are adequately protected. We don’t believe they are adequately protected a the moment.' He said the number of attacks on prison officers is on the rise. Greater Manchester Police said: 'Both men received lacerations to the body and were taken to hospital for treatment before they were discharged. 'Detectives are working with the Prison Service and a police investigation is ongoing.' A Prison Service spokesman said: 'We do not tolerate violence against our staff. Police have been informed and an investigation is taking place. We always press for the most serious charges to be laid against perpetrators of violence in prisons.'","Two wardens were slashed with makeshift knife at HMP Manchester .

"A filmmaker who was hired to make a video promoting a new Hollywood movie spent the entire £15,300 ($25,000) budget on helping the victims of the Philippines typhoon. Casey Neistat was asked to create an inspiring film to promote the Ben Stiller blockbuster, The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty. Rather than make a traditional advertising film, Neistat flew to the city of Tacloban, which was devastated by last month's Typhoon Haiyan, and handed out more than 10,000 meals, bought using the budget. Scroll down for video . Filmmaker Casey Neistat (centre) was hired to make a promotional video for the Ben Stiller movie The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty but spent the entire budget on providing aid to victims of Typhoon Haiyan . With permission from 20th Century Fox, he went to Philippines and bought thousands of meals for starving victims . With help from locals, they distributed the food parcels in the city of Tacloban, which was one of the worst affected areas . The inspiring video was filmed by Neistat and his friend Oscar using only a single camera and a tripod. Neistat said the idea came to him when he was sent an email by producers 20th Century Fox, five days after the typhoon hit. They asked him to create a film about chasing a dream that would inspire the viewer to do something they have never done. Neistat replied that the only film he wanted to make was to give away the budget to those in need - and they agreed. His response to the email said: 'Here's my concept. Give me the budget and I will go to the Philippines and spend every penny helping people in need'. The company agreed and within three days he and Oscar had landed in the Philippines and set about delivering relief. The six minute promotional video was filmed using a single camera and a tripod so all the money could be spent on aid . They almost emptied a store of its contents before driving two hours to Tacloban with the goods . Neistat said: 'Mitty is a movie about chasing a dream and they wanted me to make a movie about chasing a dream. 'I am a big dreamer but at that time only one thing came to mind; if I could do anything in the world right now what would it be? That's to help the victims of the typhoon.' They filmed themselves travelling to Tacloban on two hired passenger buses before delivering the food to hundreds of queuing people. As well as the food, the budget stretched to tools for 35 villages and medical supplies. The six minute video, called What Would You Do With $25,000?, has now been viewed more than 250,000 times on YouTube and a link has also been retweeted by the movie's star Ben Stiller.

More than one month later, 1,779 people are still missing and four million people are either homeless or living in damaged houses. Power has been restored to just one per cent of Tacloban . Neistat said: 'Never have I met such people with the resilience of these typhoon victims. 'There was one thing that stuck out, one big huge tiny thing, that was of everyone we were face to face with, thousands of people, not once, at anytime for any reason did anyone complain - no one.

"O.J. Simpson gives testimony at court in May. His bid for a retrial in his armed robbery and kidnapping case has been rejected . O.J. Simpson faces at least four more years in prison after a judge yesterday rejected his bid for a new trial in his Las Vegas armed robbery and kidnapping conviction. His legal team argued he had not received a fair trial in 2008 and that his original attorney had botched the case. However Clark County District Judge Linda Marie Bell said in her ruling: 'All grounds in the petition lack merit and, consequently, are denied.' Simpson's lawyer Patricia Palm said she spoke briefly with the former football star from prison, and said he was disappointed but would appeal to the Nevada Supreme Court. She said: 'We're confident that when we get to the right court we'll get relief because he deserves relief, because he didn't get a fair trial.' If the 66-year-old Simpson loses his . appeal to the state high court, he could take the case to federal courts . to argue his constitutional right to effective counsel was violated. Simpson was found guilty of kidnapping, . armed robbery and other charges in what he said was an attempt to . retrieve memorabilia and personal items from two sports collectibles . dealers in a casino hotel room. Simpson was sentenced to between nine to 33 years . in Nevada state prison but was granted parole on some convictions in . July, meaning he must serve at least four more years locked up. Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson, whose wife was the judge who presided over the Simpson 2008 trial, called Bell's ruling the right decision. 'I believe Mr Simpson received a fair trial and had more than competent counsel,' Wolfson said. Simpson's conviction came 13 years to the day after the former movie and TV star was acquitted in the Los Angeles 'trial of the century' in the stabbing deaths of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Goldman. Six years later, a jury in Miami acquitted him of all charges in a Florida road rage case. Simpson's legal defense in his Las Vegas trial was headed by Yale Galanter, the Miami-based attorney who represented him in the 2001 road rage case. Attorney Gabriel Grasso served with Galanter as co-counsel in Las Vegas. Galanter, who testified during Simpson's five-day habeas corpus hearing in May, said he felt vindicated. His legal team had argued that his previous attorney had botched the case and he was not given a fair trial . Simpson's lawyer at the 2008 trial Yale Galanter, right, has defended his performance on his client's behalf and calls the claims a 'charade' 'As O.J.'s lawyer and confidante, it was gut-wrenching for me to have to be in a position to defend my strategy and efforts on his behalf as his lawyer and testify against my client,' Galanter said. 'If I did what their legal team says I did, the first thing O.J. should have said to me was, ""Hey I'm in jail and it's because of you. Go screw yourself.""' Bell's 101-page ruling rejected arguments that Simpson had received inadequate legal representation. 'Mr Simpson's convictions stem from serious offenses,' she wrote. The judge noted the involvement of six co-conspirators and weeks of advance planning. 'Mr Simpson specifically asked two of his co-conspirators to bring weapons... to show the sellers he meant business,' she said. And the two memorabilia dealers were 'lured into a small hotel room' where they were surprised by Simpson's group. The judge considered a 94-page petition for a new trial. Simpson's . new legal team - Palm, Ozzie Fumo and Tom Pitaro - said they believed . they presented overwhelming evidence that Galanter knew of Simpson's . plan, had conflicted interests that shaped the way he handled the case, . and that Simpson didn't get a fair trial. Mr Galanter said he felt vindicated by the judge's rejection of Simpson retrial bid . They said Galanter failed to hire an investigator or have experts examine crucial evidence, including audio tapes that jurors later said convinced them of Simpson's guilt. Simpson's lawyers sought to show that Galanter advised Simpson it was OK to take back his items and should have stepped aside so he could be called as a witness for Simpson's defense. Instead, they said, Galanter advised Simpson not to testify and reached a pretrial agreement with prosecutors not to enter evidence into the trial record of phone calls that raised questions about whether he had knowledge of the heist. Simpson, pictured at the 2008 trial, will appeal to the Nevada Supreme Court . Finally, Simpson's legal team said that by handling the appeal, Galanter nearly precluded Simpson from ever arguing he had ineffective counsel. A shackled Simpson spent an entire day in May testifying for the first time in the case. Simpson, noticeably grayer and heavier after five years in prison, said he believes Galanter misled him, including telling him it was OK to retrieve the family photos and memorabilia he thought had been stolen from him after his acquittal in Los Angeles in 1995. Simpson said Galanter advised him that it was his legal right to retrieve personal items as long as no force was used and no one trespassed. 'It was my stuff,' Simpson said. 'I followed what I thought was the law. My lawyer told me I couldn't break into a guy's room. I didn't break into anybody's room. I didn't try to muscle the guys.' During his parole hearing in July, Simpson said he was sorry for his actions and said he had made amends with the two memorabilia dealers. Galanter dramatically contradicted Simpson's account. He testified he was surprised when Simpson told him that he and several other men were planning a 'sting' the next morning. The attorney denied giving Simpson the go-ahead to try to retrieve the items. 'I said, ""O.J., you've got to call the police,""' Galanter testified. Galanter disputed the claim that Simpson was never informed about plea bargain discussions with prosecutors that could have resulted in a prison sentence of just a few years. Galanter also testified that Simpson later confided to him that he knew some of the five men with him the night of the robbery had guns. Simpson maintains to this day that he never asked anyone to bring guns or saw weapons in the cramped hotel room. 'Mr. Simpson never told me he was going to go to the Palace (Station) hotel with a bunch of thugs, kidnap people and take property by force,' Galanter said. 'To insinuate I, as his lawyer, would have blessed it is insane.'","Former footballer's team argued he had not received a fair trial in 2008 .

"A Paris-bound Air France plane was grounded in Venezuela after a tip off by French authorities that a terrorist group might be planning to detonate a bomb in midair. More than 60 technicians, bomb experts and a canine team searched the aircraft after it was grounded at Caracas airport yesterday. The precise nature of the bomb threat was not known, but Venezuelan Interior Minister Miguel Rodriguez Torres said that French authorities passed along information from a credible source that a terrorist group is seeking to place a bomb aboard an unspecified flight from Caracas to Paris, or vice versa. A passenger stands next to Air France desk at Simon Bolivar International Airport near Caracas, Venezuela. The flight was grounded on Saturday after French authorities were tipped off about a bomb threat . Venezuelan bomb experts are inspecting the plane after information that an aircraft was due to be detonated in midair . 'We don't want to speculate on the motives because the information comes directly from French intelligence services,' Rodriguez Torres said, adding that the information is still being processed. In Paris, the French Interior Ministry said today that France immediately alerted authorities upon learning of a potential threat to the route, which is served only by Air France. 'It is obviously the principle of precaution,' said Interior Ministry spokesman Pierre-Henry Brandet. 'We cannot allow the least risk, run the least risk for passengers.' He provided no details on the measures taken and refused to comment on the nature of the threat or its origin. An Air France press officer who spoke on condition of anonymity said the carrier was working 'in close collaboration' with airport and government authorities. Stranded passengers said they had cleared immigration and were preparing to board Air France flight 385 when they were told at the last minute that it was being delayed so that the Airbus A340-300 aircraft could be checked. No reason was given. Passengers said they cleared immigration when they were told the Air France flight was delayed . Passengers wait on the ground front of the Air France desk. About 100 angry passengers surrounded the Air France check-in counter to protest the airline's failure to keep them informed . 'We only learned reading Twitter that it could've been a bomb,' said Jesus Arandia, a 52-year-old university professor. About 100 angry passengers surrounded the Air France check-in counter to protest the airline's failure to keep them informed or provide alternative travel arrangements. Around midnight, the airport announced the flight was rescheduled for Sunday afternoon. 'They never told us anything,' said Marbella Covino, a 22-year-old student. The Air France office in Paris said passengers from the postponed flight were being put on a flight that will leave Caracas at 8pm local time. Venezuela's intelligence agency declined to comment on the threat, saying it is not authorised to discuss the case. An employee of Air France speaks with some passengers in front of the desk . Security breaches have been detected before at Venezuela's main international airport. In September, several Venezuelan soldiers stationed at the airport were arrested after French authorities made their biggest cocaine bust ever, seizing 1.4 tons of narcotics that were smuggled in 31 suitcases aboard another Air France flight to Paris. France is involved with two ongoing military interventions in former African colonies, in Mali where it routed Islamic extremists from the north and in Central African Republic where French troops moved in earlier this month to help stabilize the country, disarming militia to stop sectarian violence. The U.S. has warned that Middle Eastern terror groups have tried to make inroads in Venezuela, taking advantage of political cover provided by the late President Hugo Chavez's outreach to Iran and Syria, whose governments the U.S. considers state sponsors of terrorism.","Plane grounded after authorities told of plan to blow up plane in midair .

"The gray water-stained suit worn by Gene Kelly in Singin' In The Rain's iconic dance scene is on sale for $160,000 - after the owner paid just $10 for it. The anonymous collector picked up the belted two piece woolen suit in the 1970s when studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer sold off a range of movie costumes. Almost 40 years later and the suit is set to fetch a six-figure sum. Scroll down for video .

Snapped up a bargain: The anonymous collector picked up the suit for just £6.50 in 1970 when he saw Kelly's name on the label . Kelly donned the suit for the centrepiece of the 1952 comedy in which he famously splashed through puddles twirling an umbrella during a downpour. And 60 years on the jacket still bears the marks of filming - the inside of it is covered in water stains from where Kelly was repeatedly drenched during takes. Singin’ in the Rain follows Kelly’s character, actor Don Lockwood, in his attempts to move from silent films into ‘talkies’ before venturing into musicals. The highlight is Kelly’s energetic solo performance of the movie’s title song, which took three days to film. The suit was tailor-made for the 5ft 7 Kelly and was created by Oscar-winning costume designer Walter Plunkett, who also designed the clothes in Gone With The Wind. Hollywood legend has it that the wool suit shrank during the three-days of filming in the rain. Plunkett had a then-enormous costume budget for the film of $157,000 to create the period 1920s designs. Also for sale is Kelly’s beige and . navy outfit from the scene where Lockwood meets Cosmo Brown, played by . co-star Donald O’Connor, on the set of a movie. It is expected to fetch $6,500. Legend has it: The suit is water stained from when Kelly was drenched repeatedly during filming and Hollywood legend has it that it also shrunk during the three days of filming . Margaret Barrett, from Heritage Auctions, said: 'Singin’ in the Rain is one of the best and most loved musical movies ever made and this suit comes from its most famous scene. 'Incredibly the current owner picked it up from the famous MGM costume sale in 1970 for just $10. 'All the costumes were hanging on racks and as he was searching through them he noticed Gene Kelly’s nametag on the inside. 'Then he saw the inner lining was water stained and realised it had to be the jacket from Singin’ in the Rain. 'Also on the rack was another of Gene’s suits from the film which he had to pay $75 for. 'They now look like they’re going to have been a very good investment. 'The . market will decide what the suits sell for but I would like to see the . Singin’ in the Rain suit go for a six figure sum - it certainly deserves . to.' This beige and navy outfit which was also worn by Kelly in the film is being sold for $6,500 at auction . On screen: Kelly wore the beige and navy suit in the scene when his character meets Cosmo Brown . As well as starring in Singin’ in the Rain, Gene Kelly also choreographed and directed it. The film was conceived as promotional vehicle for songs written by MGM’s Arthur Freed in the 1920s and 30s. The theme song Singin’ in the Rain was first performed by Doris Eaton Travis in The Hollywood Music Box Revue in 1929. It then appeared in the 1929 musical The Hollywood Revue, on Annette Hanshaw’s album Volume 6, in the 1932 film Speak Easy and by Judy Garland in Little Nellie Kelly in 1940. Since Singin’ in the Rain it has been used in numerous films including Alfred Hitchcock’s North by Northwest in 1959 and A Clockwork Orange in 1971. It was also the subject of one of Morecambe and Wise’s most famous sketches. The auction will take place in Dallas, Texas, on December 6.","Gray belted suit was worn by Kelly in iconic scene of the 1952 movie .

"It is one of the most moving scenes in Gravity, in which a desperate Sandra Bullock shares her fears of death with a disembodied foreign voice hundreds of miles away. Now, a seven-minute short film has been released showing the other side of that mayday phone call and it could be in the running for an Oscar. The film shows Inuit Aningaaq speaking over the radio to Bullock's fearful character, Ryan Stone. Scroll down for video . Aningaaq shows the other side of a desperate radio conversation Sandra Bullock's character has from space in Gravity. It follows the Inuit as he hears her distress call while he is in a remote Greenland fjord . The beautiful seven-minute short film has been submitted for Academy Award consideration and if both Aningaaq and Gravity are nominated it will be the first time two separate films from the same source material have been in contention in the same year . Despite not being able to speak each other's language, the pair talk about their heartache and their worries. Both Gravity, which has so far grossed $500million, and the short, called Aningaaq, use the same conversation but show the other point of view. It was funded by Warner Home Video and . intended as an extra feature on the Blu-ray release of Gravity but it . now could be nominated for an Oscar after exceeding expectations. It has been submitted for consideration in the live-action short category of the Academy Awards. If successful, Aningaaq and 'parent film' Gravity could become the first feature length and short film based on the same material to be nominated for an Oscar in the same year. The short film shows what Aningaaq was saying back to Sandra Bullock's Ryan Stone . Aningaaq was directed by Jonas Cuaron, son of Gravity director Alfonso Cuaron and also the co-writer of the blockbuster's screenplay. It shows the fisherman, played by Greenlander Orto Ignatiussen, hearing Ryan Stone's mayday call from space but failing to understand what she is saying. Instead he tells her about his love for one of his dogs, which is sick and dying, and how he should kill her but cannot bear to. In Gravity, Stone pictures a happy scene as she listens to the dogs bark and hears Aningaaq sing a lullaby to his restless baby. Gravity, starring Bullock and George Clooney, has now grossed more than $500million . However, the short shows the viewer that, like Stone, Aningaaq is also in a lonely harsh environment, struggling for survival. Jonas Cuaron told The Hollywood Reporter he had the idea when travelling through Greenland and speaking to locals about their love for their sled dogs. It is set in a remote Greenland fjord and cost just $100,000 to make. Jonas Cuaron told THR: 'It's this moment where the audience and the character get this hope that Ryan is finally going to be OK.

"Opposites can attract and Anzac a doe-eyed baby kangaroo has become best friends with Peggy, a tiny squint-eyed wombat. Their unlikely union developed after the pair -  both orphans - shared a pouch at the Wildlife Kilmore Rescue Centre in Victoria, Australia. At just over five months old, Anzac was brought to the centre after being rescued in the Macedon Ranges. The joey is in the mother kangaroo's . pouch for about eight months, depending on the species, but Anzac was . abandoned a few months before he was ready to be free. Creature comfort:  Anzac the joey and Peggy the wombat have become best friends after sharing a pouch together at the Wildlife Kilmore Rescue Centre in Victoria, Australia . Happy pairing: At just over five months old, Anzac was brought to the centre after being rescued in the Macedon Ranges. Missing his mum, Anzac was placed with wombat Peggy and the two now sleep together . Luckily he was placed with Peggy, who was also feeling lonely and the two now sleep together, reducing the amount Anzac misses his mum. Worker Lisa Milligan explained the unlikely friends are comforted by each others movement and heartbeat. She said: 'There are lots of baby animals about at the moment, and they are orphaned for a range of reasons.' One of the reasons the lively duo get on so well is their similar personalities - with Anzac described as very social while Peggy is boisterous and cheeky. It's unclear if Peggy and Anxac's friendship will continue as they grow - firstly Peggy may not be able to keep up with Anzac. Wombats walk with a somewhat awkward, shuffling or waddling gait. Comforting cuddle: Worker Lisa Milligan said the unlikely friends are comforted by each other's movement and heartbeat . Opposites attract: One of the reasons the lively duo get on so well is their similar personalities - with Anzac described as very social while Peggy is boisterous and cheeky . Although they appear to be slow and docile, wombats are very alert and can move quickly with great agility when needed. But in contrast kangaroos can move a lot quicker and hop so efficiently that they can reach great speeds. Although tiny at the moment as they get older their sizes will also start to differ greatly. Peggy will become powerfully built, weighing about 30kg - about the size of a small pig, although wombats are rarely dangerous. But Anzac will become a lot taller and weigh about anything upwards of 30kg. Luckily they are both herbivores so they won't be a threat to each other and if their friendship does continue they could spend their days side-by-side looking for luscious blades of green grass and leaves.","Anzac the joey and Peggy the wombat sleep together at the Wildlife Kilmore Rescue Centre in Victoria, Australia .

"Emperor penguins are having to struggle up 100ft walls of ice as warmer temperatures force them out of their traditional breeding grounds just like in the film Happy Feet 2, a study has shown. The gravity-defying march of the penguins was spotted by British Antarctic Survey scientists in satellite images of four colonies. The birds normally breed on thin sea ice, close to easily accessible food sources. Emperor penguins are having to struggle up 100ft walls of ice as warmer temperatures force them out of their traditional breeding grounds . But ice forming later than usual in recent years has compelled them to move to much thicker floating ice shelves. Experts believe the unusual behaviour could indicate that the penguins are adapting to environmental change. In the hit film the penguins become trapped by an iceberg. They either have to climb out or slide down. Lead scientist Dr Peter Fretwell, from the BAS, said: 'These charismatic birds tend to breed on the sea ice because it gives them relatively easy access to waters where they hunt for food. 'Satellite observations captured of one colony in 2008, 2009 and 2010 show that the concentration of annual sea ice was dense enough to sustain a colony. 'But this was not the case in 2011 and 2012, when the sea ice did not form until a month after the breeding season began. The gravity-defying march of the penguins was spotted by British Antarctic Survey scientists in satellite images of four colonies . 'During those years the birds moved up on to the neighbouring floating ice shelf to raise their young. 'What's particularly surprising is that climbing up the sides of a floating ice shelf - which at this site can be up to 30 metres high - is a very difficult manoeuvre for emperor penguins. Experts believe the unusual behaviour could indicate that the penguins are adapting to environmental change like in the film Happy Feet Two . 'Whilst they are very agile swimmers they have often been thought of as clumsy out of the water.' The findings are reported in the online journal Public Library of Science ONE. Because of their reliance on sea ice as a breeding platform, emperor penguins have been classified as ""near threatened"" in the International Union for Conservation of Nature's ""red list"" of endangered species. Dr Barbara Wienecke, from the Australian Antarctic Division, who also took part in the research, said: 'These new findings are an important step forward in helping us understand what the future may hold for these animals, however, we cannot assume that this behaviour is widespread in other penguin populations. 'The ability of these four colonies to relocate to a different environment - from sea ice to ice shelf - in order to cope with local circumstances, was totally unexpected. We have yet to discover whether or not other species may also be adapting to changing environmental conditions.' Whereas sea-ice is frozen salt water, ice shelves consist of glacial ice that has flowed from the land to the sea. Ice cliffs that form around the outer edge of a shelf can reach heights of almost 200ft. The scientists focused on four northern Antarctic colony sites at Barrier Bay, the Jason Peninsula at the tip of the Larsen Ice Shelf, Ruppert Coast, and the Nickerson Ice Shelf. Satellite images and radar data were analysed to track penguin movements and identify the terrain.","Gravity-defying march of the penguins was spotted by British Antarctic Survey scientists in satellite images of four colonies .

"The BBC is using laws designed to catch terrorists and organised crime networks to track down people who dodge the licence fee, it emerged yesterday. The publicly-funded corporation uses the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA), designed by the last Labour government to fight terrorism, to catch those who evade paying the £145.50 fee. Now, however, its ability to use sweeping surveillance powers could be stopped by a new review announced yesterday by culture secretary Sajid Javid. Mr Javid's independent inquiry into TV licence fee enforcement will examine the corporation's use of covert surveillance operations on those it thinks have not paid the obligatory licence fee. Scroll down for video . Culture Secretary Sajid Javid has ordered an independent inquiry into the BBC's use of anti-terror spying laws . The Culture Secretary said enforcement of TV licensing will be examined in a new review (file image) Although the BBC has admitted using the hugely controversial RIPA, it has refused to say in what way, when and how often. Appearing before the Commons culture, media and sport committee yesterday, Mr Javid was asked whether he felt it was 'appropriate' for the corporation to use RIPA powers. He replied: 'This whole issue of people who aren't paying the licence fee, how do you go after them and get them to pay, needs to be looked at very carefully. 'And that's exactly why I set up this review, which is an independent review.' He said that the inquiry will be led by leading barrister David Perry QC, and will conclude next June. Mr Perry has previously advised the Crown Prosecution Service on the cash for honours scandal, and acted for the CPS on the prosecution of radical Muslim hate preacher Abu Hamza for murder and race-hate offences. The review's primary purpose is to investigate whether evasion should be decriminalised following concern at the number of convictions. Almost 200,000 people are prosecuted a year – one in nine of all lower court cases - and more than 50 people were sent to prison in 2012-2013 for failing to buy a TV licence.  Many get penalties of up to £1,000 and a criminal record. The BBC has been used anti-terror spying laws to catch licence fee dodgers, but maybe not for much longer . Mr Javid said: 'When the licence fee was put in place it was a long, long time ago and some people argued that you needed to have criminal sanctions because there is no way to cut off someone if they don't pay their fee in the way you can cut off someone's electricity supply. 'But clearly times have changed. 'Technology has moved on. Also, there is a question of fairness – 50 people went to jail for not paying their licence fee. I think this raises considerable concerns.' Tory MP John Whittingdale, who chairs the culture committee, said there were 'big question marks' over the BBC's use of RIPA powers. He added: 'The problem is, the BBC won't tell us how it is being used, or in what circumstances. That means we can't be sure it is being used properly. 'This legislation was designed to fight terrorism and organised crime. I can't imagine it was intended for people who don't pay their TV licence.' Emma Carr, of the campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: 'The public were told these powers were going to be used to catch terrorists and paedophiles, not to help the BBC to snoop on people who haven't paid the licence fee. 'It is clear that the use of these powers has reached unacceptable levels. It is important that there is a wholesale review of how these [powers] are being used not just by police and intelligence services but also by organisations like the BBC.' Home Secretary Theresa May recently ordered that the rules governing the use of RIPA should be tightened so they are used only to investigate serious crimes. The Metropolitan Police Service has come under fire for using the powers to access the phone logs of reporters on two newspapers to trace their sources. In 2012, Big Brother Watch discovered 345 councils had been authorised to use RIPA 9,607 times in just three years – the equivalent of around nine spying missions a day. Seven public authorities, including the BBC, refused under the Freedom of Information Act to disclose why or how often they had used the powers. New BBC Trust chairman Rona Fairhead, pictured at a previous meeting, was accused of 'going native' by Conservative MP Philp Davies after her initial report on the corporation described it in glowing terms . At the time, the BBC said the reason for its secrecy was 'to ensure people without a valid TV licence don't use this information to their advantage'. Last night a BBC spokesman said: 'Legislation explicitly grants the BBC the right to use these powers to detect unlicensed use of television receivers. 'We're regularly inspected by independent regulators and have always been open about using this power when there is no other option to help reduce evasion on behalf of the vast majority of the population who pay for their licence.' RIPA, passed by Labour in 2000 ostensibly as an anti-terror measure, gives public authorities sweeping powers to snoop on the public. The most common use of the legislation is to demand phone companies hand over an individual's communications data. This would include details of who a person called, when and for how long. However, the act can also be used to mount undercover surveillance operations – such as secretly following a person to see when they are at home. This could, in theory, be used to match the times when a TV is believed to have been in use. Rona Fairhead, the new chairman of the BBC Trust, the independent governing body of the BBC, was accused of 'going native' after giving a glowing initial report into the corporation. Many had hoped Fairhead, who had extensive private sector experience before joining the Trust, would bring a firmer approach to the corporation whose image had been tarnished by scandals including large pay-offs for departing executives. Conservative MP Philip Davies said he was 'alarmed' by Fairhead not having identified a single weakness yet, and asked her 'Have you gone native in record time?' She replied: 'Absolutely not.'","BBC admits using RIPA anti-terror legislation to find licence fee dodgers .

"It's an eye-watering amount of money, but the CEO of Dropbox, Drew Houston, 30, decided to share the balance of his bulging bank account during a speech to graduating students. He displayed a screenshot of his bank account, showing the moment when he reaped the benefits of Dropbox's first-ever funding round - a cool $1.2 million from Sequoia Capital in 2007. Perhaps he was giving the graduands of his alma mater, MIT something to aim for? Bank of opportunity: The seed money given by venture capitalists for Drew Houston's Dropbox company. Six years on he is worth $400 million . 'For a 24-year-old, this is Christmas--and opening your present is hitting refresh over and over on bankofamerica.com and watching your company's checking account go from $60 dollars to $1.2 million dollars. At first, I was ecstatic--that number has two commas in it! I took a screenshot--but then I was sick to my stomach. Someday these guys are going to want this back. What the hell have I gotten myself into?' Putting things into perspective, after the huge deposit is made, among Houston's first purchases is a $17.35 purchase at Radio Shack. Commencement speech: Founder/CEO of Dropbox Drew Houston spoke to graduates at MIT. He told them they they were the sum of the five closest people they hung around with . Great idea: The website allows users to create a special folder on each of their computers, which Dropbox then synchronizes so that it appears to be the same folder (with the same contents) regardless of which computer is used to view it . During his commencement speech, Mr Houston spoke of how valuable his time at MIT was in pushing him to creative Dropbox. 'They say that you're the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with. Think about that for a minute: who would be in your circle of 5? I have some good news: MIT is one of the best places in the world to start building that circle. If I hadn't come here, I wouldn't have met Adam, I wouldn't have met my amazing co-founder, Arash, and there would be no Dropbox. One thing I've learned is surrounding yourself with inspiring people is now just as important as being talented or working hard. Your circle pushes you to be better, just as Adam pushed me.' Just a few years ago, Mr Houston was named one of the most promising players aged under 30 by various business publications such as Forbes. Glad to be back: Drew Houston (center), gave the speech at his Alma Mater, MIT to this years graduating class . The company he founded, Dropbox, has been called one of the 20 best startups of Silicon Valley. Dropbox is a free service that lets you bring your photos, documents and videos anywhere and share them easily. The Dropbox allows users to create a special folder on each of their computers, which Dropbox then synchronizes so that it appears to be the same folder (with the same contents) regardless of which computer is used to view it. Mr Houston came up with the idea after repeatedly forgetting his USB flash drive while he was a student at MIT. After graduating from MIT and founding Dropbox in 2007, he secured seed funding from a startup accelerator, Y Combinator, and launched Dropbox on stage at TechCrunch Disrupt in 2008. Houston worked on a few other startups before striking gold with Dropbox. He said the premise behind Dropbox was to make life easier. Certainly, he no longer has to worry about where his next meal is coming from as he is estimated to be valued at $400 million.","Dropbox CEO Drew Houston digs up an image of his bank account .

"Honey Boo Boo's family is being investigated by Child Protective Services in Georgia after Mama June reportedly started dating a convicted sex offender accused of abusing one of her daughters. CPS formally opened an investigation to determine if any crimes have been committed against June Shannon's youngest children - Lauryn 'Pumpkin' Shannon, 14, Jessica 'Chubbs', 17, and nine-year-old Alana, also known as Honey Boo Boo - after calls from the public, according to RadarOnline. Mama June has been spotted with child molester Mark McDaniel, and he was pictured with Alana just last month, according to photos obtained by TMZ. Another of June's children, 20-year-old Anna, has claimed that McDaniel sexually assaulted her when she was younger. 'Social workers will be making formal contact with all of June’s children, and any other minors that might have come into contact with Mark McDaniel,' a CPS source told Radar. Scroll down for video... Risk: TMZ have now reported that Mama June - pictured here on Friday October 24 - exposed daughter Alana, nine, to convicted child molester Mark McDaniel just last month . What's next? Mama June denied letting her daughter meet with McDaniel - but photos show them together . 'This is being taken very, very seriously by the department.' A spokesperson for the agency could not confirm the reports, citing privacy laws. This weekend, TMZ shared an image, taken on September 9, showing 53-year-old McDaniel gently touching Alana on the shoulder as they sit on a staircase together with June. Alana is just a year older than when June's eldest daughter Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell - who is now 20-years-old - claims she was abused by McDaniel. June's daughter Anna Cardwell told Radar on Friday that her mother's sex offender ex-boyfriend McDaniel molested her when she was just eight. She told Radar: 'I believe she is seeing him and hanging around him. I'm hurt.' McDaniel was released from prison in Georgia earlier this year after serving 10 years behind bars for aggravated child molestation. Anna said she was the victim in that case, USA Today reported. June's alleged relationship with the convicted sex offender has led to the cancellation of popular TLC reality show Here Comes Honey Boo Boo. Just released: Mark was released from prison last month after being jailed for 10 years for molesting an unnamed eight-year-old relative of then-girlfriend Mama June's . 'You can't believe everything you read': The cancellation came after 'Mama June' Shannon reportedly began dating convicted sex offender Mark McDaniel - allegedly pictured here in a hotel room last month . Registered: McDaniel's crime is public record on the Georgian sex offender registry, as part of his release requires him to keep authorities constantly updated on his whereabouts . After Mama June and McDaniel's relationship emerged, TMZ revealed June's husband Mike 'Sugar Bear' Thompson had been aware of the relationship but chose to ignore it. June kept 'a box of photos' of McDaniel in the house - but even when Sugar Bear told her to get rid of them, she wouldn't, TMZ reported. The report added that she began seeing McDaniel again after he was released from prison in March. It had previously been reported that it was Sugar Bear who had been cheating on June using on-line dating sites, but now TMZ claims it was actually June who was having an affair, and used the story about Sugar Bear's infidelity to end her relationship with him. Support: McDaniel's daughter-in-law Peaches McDaniel, pictured left and right with his son, has voiced her support for her father-in-law online, calling him an 'amazing man' and an 'amazing father' Concerns: Her daughter was born in July. She shared this picture online showing McDaniel holding the girl . The revelation comes after a report in People hints that June now faces losing her children to child services. Susan Boatwright of Georgia's Division of Family and Child Services told People: 'From our point of view, when there are young children who are not able to protect themselves that are in daily contact or living with a sex offender, someone would go out and assess the situation and decide whether the children can stay there or not.' She added: 'If we thought a child was in harm's way in any way, shape or form, we would develop a safety plan and make sure the children are not around an offender.' Despite the startling revelations about McDaniel's past, his daughter-in-law Peaches McDaniel has defended him on Facebook, insisting he's a good father. Out and about: Honey Boo Boo is pictured visiting a local gas station in McIntyre, Georgia on Monday as speculation continues about how much contact the youngster has had with her mother's boyfriend . Trip: Honey Boo Boo stepped out with her big sister, Lauryn 'Pumpkin' Shannon, amid the controversy . 'If you are going to judge someone by their past, look at your own first,' she wrote, TMZ reported. 'Michaels dad is an amazing man, as well amazing father... Peoples past are completely irrelevant to the present.' She also shares images online of McDaniel holding her own child. Mama June has protested her innocence, saying that she hadn't seen McDaniel in 10 years, but TMZ reported over the weekend that she had been in fact been seen house-hunting with him in Georgia. She was joined on the home-shopping expedition last month by daughter Lauryn 'Pumpkin' Shannon and McDaniel's son, TMZ claimed. Speaking out: June posted a video on Friday confirming the cancellation of Here Comes Honey Boo Boo . Another picture showed the group walking up towards the entrance of the two-story brown brick, gable-roofed mansion. Pumpkin, who stuck up for her mom by saying June had not been with McDaniel after he got out of prison, was also pictured looking chummy with McDaniel's son during outing. McDaniel was released in March after serving a 10-year prison service for 'forcing a girl to perform oral sex on him' according to TMZ. Radar report that Anna said she was abused by McDaniel, 53, in 2002 and 2003. He was indicted in June 2003 for 'aggravated child molestation and aggravated sexual battery on his young victim' which Radar now reports was Anna. The case was dismissed some time later, however, McDaniel was then convicted on aggravated child molestation charges in a different case in Spalding County. It's over: Here Comes Honey Boo Boo was cancelled by TLC on Friday . Shock new claim: Mama June's sex offender ex-boyfriend molested her own daughter Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell (pictured above) who spoke about the incident on Friday . Dinner for one: Sugar Bear is seen getting food on Friday following the shocking revelations about his family . Anna had spoken to Radar to defend her mother (who has strenuously denied dating McDaniel) but appears to have now had a change of heart. TMZ also reported that Anna feels 'betrayed' by her mother for seeing McDaniel again, and feels that their relationship is now 'destroyed'. The site claims that TLC - that produced the reality show - have reached out to Anna to offer counselling. According to TMZ; not only was June secretly dating McDaniel for several months, she also purchased gifts - including a used car - for him. June allegedly went shopping for the car last month, visiting at least one dealership near her home in McIntyre, Georgia. The website report that the family matriarch told the dealer the vehicle was for 'her daughter.' But sources say it was, in fact, 'secretly' intended for McDaniel. Criminal past: In 1998, Sugar Bear was sentenced to five years for robbing a series of campsites and setting fire to at least one camper. The father of Honey Boo Boo’s sister Jessica, Michael Anthony Ford, right, is in prison for the sexual exploitation of a child. He is not expected to be released for another 10 years .","Mama June exposed nine-year-old daughter Alana - also known as Honey Boo Boo - to convicted child molester Mark McDaniel just last month .

"ONE DAY AS A TIGER by John Porter (Vertebrate £20) This is a book about mountains and lost youth, by a man who is no longer young, but who remembers only too fiercely what it was like. And it’s not just about lost youth in general, but a particular lost youth. Alex Macintyre was a shining star of British mountaineering in the late 1970s. He had the looks, he had the vast mop of curly hair, he had the talent, bravery and ambition. And, in 1982, as he climbed the south face of Annapurna, a single stone fell from on high and hit him on the head, killing him instantly. He was 28. Alex Macintyre was a shining star of British mountaineering in the late 1970s . Mountaineering, as we know, is not the safest sport in the world. Alex himself told a girlfriend that, whenever he went off to the Alps or the Himalayas, there was a one in ten chance he would not come back. Even so, there was something brutally random about this particular end. One day, if you’re unlucky, your number will come up, and there’s absolutely nothing you can do about it. John Porter knew Alex well and climbed with him many times. They met at Leeds University, then — as now — a hub of mountaineering obsessiveness and excellence. Porter, born in Massachusetts, was a postgraduate and eight years Alex’s senior, but seems to have seen Alex surpass him without jealousy or rancour. He has been thinking about writing this book, and then finally writing it, for very many years. The great Reinhold Messner described him as ‘the purest exponent of the lightweight style now climbing in Himalaya’ ‘Alex was in many ways unique,’ says Maria Coffey, the author of several books about the psychological and emotional implications of the sport. ‘He stood out from everyone else. He definitely had a glimmer.’ The great Reinhold Messner, whom even I have heard of, described him at the time as ‘the purest exponent of the lightweight style now climbing in Himalaya’. ‘Lightweight’, in this context, meant climbing in small teams of three, four, or five, carrying as little as possible, and climbing fast in order to make the great back-up systems of traditional expeditions unnecessary. Chris Bonnington, the most famous mountaineer then (and probably still), made his reputation by setting up large, well-prepared expeditions that attacked peaks with almost military intent. Such expeditions often had so many porters, they had to hire extra porters to carry enough food for the original porters. What made the expeditions possible was a series of technological improvements in mountaineering equipment, but also, bluntly, the will to do it. Mountaineering has inspired a considerable literature, and not surprisingly: its exponents routinely contemplate the infinite . Alex, says Porter, ‘had a desire to conceive bold projects above and beyond the ordinary’. They were young, it was the 1970s, everything was possible. Only just, though. Money was perpetually scarce, sponsorship minimal. On long train journeys across Europe and Asia, equipment was always getting lost and impounded. Officials needed to be bribed, some with hard currency, others with bottles of scotch that had been smuggled along for the purpose. And there were more ways of losing your life than falling off mountains. One team of three, on the long trek back to civilisation after completing their mission, settled down for the night in their sleeping bags. When the one in the middle woke in the morning, he was surprised to see his two fellows had exchanged positions in the night. But they hadn’t. Someone had come along, chopped both their heads off and swapped them over. The books is generously illustrated with 75 photos, in colour and black-and-white, of these terrifying young people scaling these impossible peaks (stock photo . Porter describes a small, incestuous world in which everybody knew everybody else and had often slept with each other’s girlfriends. ‘As a community, it is self-absorbed, fuelled with adrenaline on the crags and with alcohol in the evenings, no different to any other small, tight-knit group living on the edge.’ At the end of the book, he gives a list of those who died along the way. This golden generation, most of whom would now be in their 60s, all but climbed themselves to extinction. Mountaineering has inspired a considerable literature, and not surprisingly: its exponents routinely contemplate the infinite, and many of them are still wondering what to make of it all when they hang up their crampons. Porter’s fine and intelligent book has just won the Grand Prize at the Banff Mountain Book Festival, which is big news in the world of adventure and environmental publishing. It’s also generously illustrated with 75 photos, in colour and black-and-white, of these terrifying young people scaling these impossible peaks, living in the moment, as you have to, because the past has gone and the future might never arise.","Alex Macintyre was a  star of British mountaineering in the late 1970s .

"The Queen personally intervened to ensure that Prince Philip rather than Princess Margaret would have acted as regent if she had died in the early years of her reign. In July 1953, just a month after her Coronation, the Queen lobbied for a change in the law to prevent her sister ever becoming regent, Government papers show. Under the terms of the Regency Act 1937, had the Queen died or become incapacitated, Prince Charles would have succeeded her. But as he was just four years old in 1953, Princess Margaret would have taken over as regent until he was 18. Scroll down for video . Queen Elizabeth, left, lobbied to change the law in 1953, so Prince Philip, rear, would take over as regent instead of her sister Princess Margaret, centre, in the event of her death until Prince Charles was older . Files obtained by this newspaper under Freedom of Information laws show that the Queen’s suggested change caused considerable discussion in the then Government, and that the Queen wished to see the change to the law brought in as soon as possible. Some Ministers were worried the public might regard any changes as an affront to the Queen’s younger sister. They were also worried about the timing of any new legislation, given continued speculation about Princess Margaret’s private life. At the time she was involved in a romance with RAF Group Captain Peter Townsend, who was considered an unsuitable husband for her because he was divorced and a commoner. One document that details a Cabinet discussion of July 6, 1953, expressed the fear that ‘if the Bill were introduced at this juncture, it might give rise to controversy owing to the publicity given by certain newspapers to reports linking the name of Princess Margaret with that of a commoner recently divorced’. There were fears surrounding Princess Margaret's relationship with Group Captain Peter Townsend, pictured, who was a divorced commoner . The Government’s preferred option was to delay the new legislation until the autumn, during the Queen’s planned tour of the Commonwealth. Ministers hoped that speculation about Princess Margaret’s private life would have died down by then. But the documents show that the Queen did not want to wait. At a Cabinet discussion on July 8, it was reported that ‘the Home Secretary [Sir David Maxwell Fyfe] said the Queen’s Private Secretary had also spoken emphatically to him in favour of immediate legislation’. Significantly, the files stress that the Queen’s position had the full support of Princess Margaret. A briefing note for a Commonwealth Heads of Government summit held in London on June 5, 1953, stated: ‘The Queen’s wish in this matter was shared by other members of the Royal Family, and in particular, by Princess Margaret.’ Prime Minister Winston Churchill backed the Palace’s view that the change in the law should not be delayed, although his ability to influence matters was limited because a month earlier he had suffered a stroke. In a memo dated July 8, 1953, Churchill was dismissive of the concern over press coverage, writing: ‘The world does not come to an end because there is a caterwaul for two or three days... I am for going ahead and am only sorry I cannot take an active part in the dispute.’ In the event the Regency Act was passed in November 1953. Speculation about Prince Margaret’s relationship with Townsend continued but in 1955 it was announced the couple would not marry. The Princess later married Antony Armstrong-Jones, the Earl of Snowdon, whom she divorced in 1978. She died in 2002 aged 71. Royal biographer Hugo Vickers said the Queen wanted the Bill to go through to ensure that the Duke of Edinburgh had a greater degree of responsibility. He added: ‘I think the change was entirely logical. It was perhaps motivated by five per cent negativity towards Princess Margaret and 95 per cent positivity towards the Duke of Edinburgh.’ A spokesman for Buckingham Palace declined to comment.

"Not even a thousands of online supporters could save a 92-year-old World War II veteran from his vengeful daughter. John Potter has revealed that his own daughter will evict him next week from the house in Zaleski, Ohio, that he built himself 56 years ago. Online donors raised $138,000 for Mr Potter to buy back the home from Janice Cottrill, but she rejected his offers and demanded twice what the property is worth, he said. As a result, Potter expects a judge will kicked him out of his own house. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Success! John Potter, 91, seen earlier this year during his campaign to buy back his home, says he's 'amazed' by the more than 5,000 people who have donated beyond his $125,000 goal . Evicted: Earlier this year Mr Potter's daughter, Janice Cottrill, sent him an eviction notice after she illegally signed over this home he built 53-years old to her name, according to his granddaughter . Early this year Janice Cottrill and her husband Dean sent her father an eviction notice, saying she they had terminated his 'existing lease' For more videos and information on Mr. Potter, please go to Gofundme.com . In 2004 Mr . Potter was battling a serious illness when he handed his general power . of attorney rights to Cottrill. Unbeknownst . to Mr Potter, she allegedly used that power to convey the deed to the one-story, . three-bedroom home he built 56-years ago to herself. Ms Contrill has not said why she is so insistent about kicking her own father out of the house he built. ABC News reports she rejected his purchase offers and demanded he pay her twice the appraised value of the home. 'To me the situation is just so heartbreaking,' Potter's granddaughter Jaclyn Fraley told ABC. Mr Potter says appraisers told hm the home was worth just less than $50,000 - far less than he thought. Jaclyn Fraley, 35, hasn¿t spoken to her mother and stepfather in two years since she learned about their plan to place her grandfather in a nursing home . Mr Potter said his first offer to buy . the home for appraised value was greeted with a counter offer for . $85,000 - plus $4,000 in eviction fees and $11,500 in attorney fees. Mr Potter raised the offer to $66,000 on June 13, but never heard back from his daughter. ‘I laid awake at night trying to figure . out what in the world I could have done to these people to make them so . angry at me,’ he told a local TV station earlier this year.

'I never knew people could love an old man so much,' he told his granddaughter. Potter turns 92 this week and his grand-daughter says she would love to be able to give him back the rights to his home for his birthday . After Mr Potter's daughter sent him an eviction notice earlier this year, Ms Fraley organized the desperate fundraiser for him in April while sharing with the public his dire situation.

I got out of the army and got on my feet on the ground, I rented a . power shovel and dug a hole in the ground, built a basement and built a . house on top of it,' he told ABC of the home. When Mr Potter learned of the deed transfer in 2010 he switched power of attorney to his granddaughter, Jaclyn, who's now 35. She hasn’t spoken to her mother and . stepfather in two years since she learned about their plan to sell her . grandfather's home and place him in a nursing home. Mr Potter has already attempted to . sue to get his home back, arguing that his daughter had transferred the . deed to herself illegally. He . initially won a county court ruling, but last year an appeals court . ruled that because the statute of limitations of four years had passed . on the accusation of fraud the deed could not be handed back to Mr . Potter. Early this . year, Janice Cottrill and her husband Dean sent her father an eviction . notice, saying she they had terminated his ‘existing lease.’ Ms . Fraley said her grandfather and her mom had argued over visitation . rights for Mr Potter's autistic son, Joe, who Mrs Cottrill took over . custody for in 2008. With an eviction hearing due to take place on June 12, time was steadily running out for the aging vet who fought against the Japanese in the Pacific and also worked as a train dispatcher for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad.","John Potter is facing eviction from the home he built over 50 years ago .

"Cronyism? A solar energy project backed by Nancy Pelosi's brother has been granted a massive government loan (file picture) Nancy Pelosi is facing accusations of . cronyism after a solar energy project, which her brother-in-law has a stake in, landed a $737 . million loan guarantee from the Department of Energy, despite the . growing Solyndra scandal. The massive loan agreement is raising new concerns about the use of taxpayers' money as vast sums are invested in technology similar to that of the doomed energy project. The investment has intensified the debate over the effectiveness of solar energy as a major power source. The SolarReserve project is backed by an energy investment fund where the Minority Leader's brother-in-law Ronald Pelosi is second in command. PCG Clean Energy & Technology Fund (East) LLC is listed as one of the investors in the project that has been given the staggering loan, which even dwarfs that given to failed company Solyndra. Other investors include one of the major investors in Solyndra, which is run by one of the directors of Solyndra. Steve Mitchell, who served on the board of directors at the bankrupt energy company, is also managing director of Argonaut Private Equity, which has invested in the latest project. Since Solyndra has filed for bankruptcy has been asked to testify about the goings on at the firm by two members of the House and 'asked to provide documents to Congress'. Generator: Artist's impression of the solar plant being constructed north west of Tonopah, Nevada . The artist's impression shows the . incredible size of the giant solar power plant, which is being . bankrolled by President Obama's green jobs fund. Energy will be generated using . concentrated solar power technology, in which a series of mirrors direct . sunlight to a receiver at the centre of the plant. The 'solar tower' in the middle, which will be taller than the Washington Monument, is the first of its kind to be built. Stretching out across a plain in Tonopah, Nevada, the mind-bogglingly big project will generate enough electricity to power 43,000 homes. But the joint announcement by Energy Secretary Steven Chu comes just two days after the doomed Solyndra project, which cost the taxpayer $528 million from the same cash pot, was meant to be completed. The loan agreement comes as questions are raised about the effectiveness of solar power as a major energy source. Although solar energy plants are typically comparatively cheap to operate, they are extremely expensive to build. The proposed Nevada plant, which will provide power for 43,000 homes, is receiving a $737 million taxpayer loan, as well as private investment. The low amounts of power generated by solar energy plants has also been criticised. To replace existing energy sources with solar plants would take up large amounts of land and cost vast amounts of money. The project approval came as part of $1 billion in new loans to green energy companies yesterday. Republican critics of the President . Obama's solar energy program have voiced their outrage at the new loans . while the Solyndra scandal is still being investigated. They have raised concerns that the Department of Energy is rushing through the approval of loans before stimulus funds expire on Friday. While the departments insists . the projects are being properly vetted, some lawmakers have written to express concern that they vast loans are not being adequately scrutinised. 'The administration’s flagship project Solyndra is bankrupt and being investigated by the FBI, the promised jobs never materialised, and now the Department of Energy is preparing to rush out nearly $5 billion in loans in the final 48 hours before stimulus funds expire — that’s nearly $105 million every hour that must be finalised until the deadline,' said Florida representative Cliff Stearns, who is chairman of the investigations subcommittee of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. Tom Schatz, . president of Washington-based . advocacy group Citizens Against Government Waste, said: 'It is time for a full audit of their . activities, their management and their results. 'Candidly, . it might be time for the federal government to rethink the whole idea . of loan programs.' Energy Department spokesman Damien . LaVera said the project, which was had extensive reviews that included . scrutiny of the parent companies' finances. Investigation: Solyndra CEO Brian Harrison and Chief Financial Officer Bill Stover are sworn in at a House Oversight and Investigations subcommittee hearing . The shocking scale of spending Solyndra  lavished on the factory it started building alongside Interstate 880 in Fremont, California, has been revealed. When it was completed at an estimated . cost of $733 million, including proceeds from the company's $535 million U.S. loan . guarantee, it covered 300,000 sq ft, the equivalent of five . football fields. It had robots that whistled Disney tunes, spa-like showers with liquid-crystal displays of the water temperature, and glass-walled conference rooms. John Pierce, 54, a San Jose resident who worked as a facilities manager at Solyndra, said: 'The new building is like the Taj Mahal.' Designed to make far more solar panels than Solyndra got orders for, the site is now empty and U.S. taxpayers may be stuck with it. Solyndra filed for bankruptcy protection on September 6, leaving in its wake investigations by Congress and the FBI. Mr Chu said the two projects will create about 900 construction jobs and at least 52 permanent jobs. He . added: 'If we want to be a player in the global clean energy race, we . must continue to invest in innovative technologies that enable . commercial-scale deployment of clean, renewable power like solar.' The . 110-megawatt Crescent Dunes project will use the sun’s heat to create . steam that drives a turbine, SolarReserve, which is based in Santa . Monica, California. Senate . Majority Leader Harry Reid is a strong supporter of the Nevada project, . which he says will help his state's economy recover. Former Governor . Jim Gibbons, a Republican, also supported the project. Mr Pelosi is one of several controversial figures set to benefit from the huge loan agreement. The . loan approvals came just two days before the renewable energy loan . program approved under the 2009 economic stimulus law is set to expire. At least seven projects worth more than $5 billion are also waiting to be approved. California-based solar panel maker . Solyndra Inc went bankrupt after receiving its money and laid off 1,100 . workers. The firm is now under investigation by the FBI. It was the first renewable-energy . company to receive a loan guarantee under a stimulus-law program to . encourage green energy and was frequently touted by the Obama . administration as a model. President Barack Obama visited the . company's Silicon Valley headquarters last year, and Vice President Joe . Biden spoke by satellite at its groundbreaking ceremony. Since then, the company's failure has become an embarrassment for Obama. Nut . Scott Crider, a spokesman for Sempra Generation, a Sempra Energy . subsidiary that is developing the Arizona project, said its loan . guarantee was not as risky as the Solyndra loan. Most . important, the project has a 20-year agreement with Pacific Gas & . Electric Co. to buy power supplied by the solar plant, he said . Mr . Crider claimed the purchase agreement is a key element of the project . and will 'provide assurance that there are sufficient revenues in place . to support the loan guarantee'. A . similar agreement is in place in Nevada. NV Energy, the state's largest . electric utility, has agreed to buy power from the Tonopah tower, which . will connect to NV Energy's power grid.","Obama administration approved $1bn in green energy loans days after failed Solyndra project due to be completed .

"No one hunting for a flat expects much for £730-a-month in central London. And this is the proof. With a bed squeezed into the five-square-foot kitchen - inches from the hob and sink - this shoebox 'studio' apartment is a snapshot of London's ballooning housing market. Breathe in: Estate agents have marketed this £730-a-month Islington flat as 'modern' and 'fully contained' The landlord has optimistically . manoeuvred a table and chair into the remaining space of the flat in the . affluent area of Islington, north London. And the wardrobe blocks the door. But in the first 24 hours, the estate agents Relocate Me have received a wave of interest from would-be tenants. It is one of hundreds of flats soaring in price in the capital as experts continue to warn of an imminent housing bubble. London house prices rose at their fastest rate last month since records began in 1995, to an average of £435,034. Nearly 1,000 homes every month are now being sold for more than £1million. Figures reveal that around 30 houses a day are changing hands for seven figure sums – up two-thirds on a year ago. Interest: The letters have received a lot of interest but were forced to remove the listing to quell the number of abusive phone calls from people berating the price and size of the north London property . The Islington flat was advertised to potential tenants as 'fully self-contained'. It claims to have an en-suite bathroom - not pictured - and access to a shared roof terrace. Despite being 'within walking distance' of London hotspots such as Angel and King's Cross, property hunters could get a five-bedroom house for the same price just a mile away. Though still marketing the property, Relocate Me has been forced to take down their listing from rightmove.co.uk in a bid to quell the deluge of 'abusive' phone calls berating the price and size as 'unreasonable'. A member of staff, who would not be named, said: 'We just had to take it down. People have been calling up swearing and saying bad things. 'We have taken it down until we can get better marketing images or refurbish. 'It is small but it is good value for money.

"'A little soft': President Obama said he believed America had lost some of its 'competitive edge' Barrack Obama claims the U.S. had 'gotten a little soft' in the last couple decades and needs to 'get back on track'. The president was talking about the state of the economy during an interview with a local TV station from Orlando, Florida, when he made the comments. He told WESH-TV’s Jim Payne: 'The way I think about it is, this is a great, great country that had gotten a little soft and we didn’t have that same competitive edge that we needed over the last couple of decades. 'We need to get back on track.' Mr. Obama has faced heavy criticism for his handling of the economy, and the current unemployment rate  of 9.1 per cent is threatening his re-election bid. He acknowledged that with the current economic climate it is a particularly 'challenging' time for young people. He said: 'Even before the financial crisis hit, one of the reasons that I ran for president was that wages - incomes had flat-lined at the same time that costs were going up. 'I think people felt that opportunities were becoming more constricted for the next generation.' 'And that’s why making sure that we’re . revamping our education system, making sure we’ve got world class . infrastructure, investing in basic science, research and technology, . making sure that we are moving manufacturing to the US, and that we are . being tough with our trading partners, making sure that they’re not . taking advantage of us. Scroll down for video . Jobs: An unemployed man visits a temporary labor office in the California. The current national unemployment rate of 9.1 per cent is threatening the president's re-election bid . 'There are a lot of things we can do.' However the president said he still wouldn’t trade the position of the US with any country on earth. He explained: 'We still have the best universities, the best scientists, and best workers in the world; we still have the most dynamic economic system in the world. So we just need to bring all those things together.' The president has been trying to gather support for his $447 billion jobs plan, which has faced stiff resistance from Republicans, and some Democrats, who say it would be paid for by ending a series of tax cuts. He criticized Florida Governor Rick Scott claiming it was a 'mistake' to cancel a planned high-speed rail line linking Tampa to Orlando. The Obama administration had offered $2 billion to Florida to help build the railway, as part of the president's high-speed rail initiative. However Governor Scott rejected the . funds claiming the plan may not be viable and there was a strong . likelihood of it going over budget . But . Obama said: 'Florida stood to make big gains and to create a lot of . jobs down there…it was a mistake to turn that money down.

"Prosecutors have offered plea deals to the crew of New York City strippers accused of drugging wealthy men and taking them to strip clubs, where they would rack up racking up huge tabs on their credit cards. A banker, a lawyer. a doctor and a real estate attorney were among the four unidentified victims plied with ecstasy, cocaine and prescription drugs and then taken to Scores in Manhattan and the RoadhHouse NYC Gentleman’s Club in Queens. The four women — Samantha Barbash, Roselyn Keo, Karina Pacsucci and Marsi Rosen — were arrested in June on charges of grand larceny, assault and forgery after allegedly making a whopping $200,000. Busted: Samantha Barbash is allegedly part of a crew of New York City strippers who scammed wealthy men by drugging them and running up extravagant bills at topless clubs while they were in a daze . Charged: Karina Pascucci arrives in court in June after being charged in connection with a scam involving exotic dancers in New York City . Barbash, the group's alleged leader, has been offered between two and three years in prison if she pleads guilty to grand larceny, conspiracy and assault, sources told the New York Post. Pascuci and Rosen have been offered six months in jail and another six months in probation if they enter guilty pleas to attempted grand larceny and conspiracy, the Post reported. And Carmine Vitolo, a manager at RoadHouse, would get probation if she pleads guilty to conspiracy, grand larceny and tampering with evidence, according to the newspaper. The women would enter their pleas at their next appearance in Manhattan Supreme Court on December 5. It is unclear if Keo has been offered a deal, the Post reported. Prosecutors say the strippers would prowl bars in Manhattan and Long Island for their victims over a four month period beginning in September 2013. They allegedly drugged the victims with Molly, a powerful powder form of ecstasy after arranging to meet them on 'dates'. Then the women would take the men to the clubs and bring them to private rooms for dances, where they would steal their cards and racked up huge charges, court records show. The strippers falsely authorized tens of thousands of dollars to the victims' cards by forging their signatures and making them believe they were being charged for a lower amount. 'These individuals targeted and isolated victims in order to illegally obtain access to their credit cards and thousands of dollars of credit,' said Police Commissioner Bill Bratton. 'Thanks to the hard work of the investigators and prosecutors in this case, these individuals will no longer be in a position to profit from this type of fraudulent activity.' Prosecutors say Samantha Barbash led the extortion ring and threatened to blackmail some of her clients with photographs of them in compromising sexual positions from the night before . This is Scores gentlemen's club in Manhattan — one of the destination for the women after they allegedly drugged their victims . Ruthless: Samantha Barbash is allegedly the leader of a gang of strippers who have stolen hundreds of thousands of dollars from wealthy male clients in New York City . The clubs paid the women for the visits, but the establishments were not facing criminal charges, authorities said according to the Post. The men reported waking up in their cars or in hotel rooms with little or no memory of the encounters. Those who tried to dispute the strip club bills received texts from the strippers threatening to go public with their transgressions, authorities said. 'The defendants were banking on the victims being too afraid to contact the police,' said Special Narcotics Prosecutor Bridget Brennan to the New York Daily News. 'They made a serious miscalculation.' Also charged: Marsi Rosen is also charged with being part of a crime ring of strippers who have allegedly stolen at least $200,000 from wealthy New York City men . In some cases, the strippers took photos and videoed the men in compromising sexual positions with women and men and threatened to blackmail them. In May, Scores sued a cardiologist, saying he owed the club $135,303 for unpaid services. According to the lawsuit, the doctor disputed the charges by saying 'he was drugged by plaintiff's employees and thus did not authorize the charges'— a claim the club says is contradicted by security video showing him freely showing up there on four separate occasions. A source identified this man as Zyad Younan, a cardiologist at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital. According to The New York Daily News, Younan, denied he willingly authorized the $135,303 of charges. Karina Pascucci is charged with assault and theft along with her three other stripper accomplices . '[This] indictment exposes a pattern of fraud that contributed to erroneous media reports,' said Michael Weinstein, attorney of one of the alleged victims. 'We were always confident that law enforcement’s efforts would expose that my client was preyed upon by this ring and not responsible for charges to his credit card.' The three other unidentified victims were all allegedly conned for a total of $55,000. Special Narcotics Prosecutor Bridget Brennan said the scam 'involved not only the theft of $200,000, but compromised the health, safety and security of victims by covertly giving them harmful substances.' This is the RoadHouse Gentlemen's Club in Queens, another favorite destination of the strippers .","Samantha Barbash, 40, Roselyn Keo, 29, Marsi Rosen, 28, and Karina Pascucci, 26 are charged with scamming wealthy New York men .

"Researchers at Washington State University in Seattle are working on a breath test to determine if a driver is under the influence of marijuana. The News Tribune reports that law enforcement officers have a test for alcohol, but they don't have a tool to test for marijuana impairment. Right now, officers must use blood tests to determine if THC is present in a driver's blood. But WSU chemistry professor Herbert Hill says existing technologies like those used by airport security agents to detect drugs and explosives can be altered to test breath for THC. New technology: Washington State University are developing a handheld device that police officers would use test drivers for marijuana impairment. There is no current such tool for cops conducting traffic stops . Hill says his team hopes to start testing on humans early next year. The Washington State Patrol says it welcomes anything that gets impaired drivers off the road. The issue of stoned drivers has only increased for police since the state legalized recreational marijuana use in 2012. The handheld device being developed is not likely to be able to determine how much THC is in a driver's system. The current legal limit is five nanograms of active THC per milliliter of blood. However the test will be able to determine whether there is THC present. That will be enough for officers to make an arrest of an impaired driver and then do further tests that could be used in court as evidence. 'We believe at least initially that it would lower the false positives that an officer would have,' Hill told The Tribune. 'They would have a higher level of confidence in making an arrest.' A State Patrol spokesman said they were excited about the new technology, but would not be willing to implement it until the tests are 'rock solid'. Under development: Tests on the THC technology are due to start at Washington State University (pictured) in January .","Washington State University developing a device that would test drivers for marijuana impairment .

"Barcelona would not be allowed to play in La Liga if Catalonia broke away from Spain, the country's football league chief Javier Tebas said as tensions mounted in the region over the possibility of an independence referendum next month. Tebas explained that the country's sports law entitles only one non-Spanish territory - Andorra - to legally participate in the league or other official competition, and FC Andorra already competes in the Spanish league system. With La Liga already seen as a two-team competition (although Atletico Madrid won the title last season to break Real and Barca's nine-season long duopoly)  the loss of the Catalan giants would be a huge blow for the league's competitiveness. Spanish giants Barcelona would technically have to leave La Liga if Catalonia becomes independent . Xavi (right) is in favour of the referendum on Catalan independence taking place next month . Gerard Pique (right) also supports the referendum and said the fact he is a Spanish international is irrelevant . 'If Catalonia became independent, taking into consideration the Sports Law that would be enforced by the rest of Spain, Barcelona wouldn't be allowed to play,' Tebas, the president of the LFP, told a sports conference in Barcelona. 'There would have to be a change in the law made in the Spanish Parliament. 'Clearly if it happened then it would be detrimental for Spanish football to lose Barca. 'I can't imagine the LFP without Barca. In the same way as I can't imagine Catalonia without Spain, I can't see La Liga without Barca. Also if it did happen what would you call the league: the Spanish League or the Iberian League?' The fact that Andorra - a tiny state straddling the Pyrenees Mountains that separate Spain from France - is allowed to play in the league creates a precedent however that could permit the Catalan clubs' eventual inclusion. Barcelona, with superstars like Lionel Messi in their team, could be made to play in the Catalan League . Xavi and Gerard Pique are among the Barca players who have come out in support of holding an independence referendum on November 9, following a September rally in Barcelona in favour of the vote, attended by 1.8 million people according to the police. The Catalan government will decide by October 15 whether to hold a referndum. 'We have all the right in the world to vote. We need to vote, we need the people to show their opinions and I am in favour of the referendum obviously,' Xavi told a news conference. Both he and Pique were or currently are Spain internationals and the latter says that he still gives his all when playing for La Roja. 'I am Catalan and I wanted to take part in the rally. I went with friends to have a good time with the other 1.8 million that were there,' Pique told reporters. Neymar (left) and Messi celebrate the Argentine scoring against Rayo Vallecano on Saturday . 'There is no need to doubt me. I have played for the national team for 11 years and it is something different to be in favour of a referendum which is democratic. People should have the right to vote and this has nothing to do with the other.' Politics have been interwoven with Barca almost since it was formed and is summed up by the team's motto: 'more than a club'. The extent to which Barca has pushed the Catalan nationalist cause has depended on the board in power, but it always plays a central role in cultural life. Pique (left) has played for Spain for 11 years but thinks the referendum should take place . The current board, first under president Sandro Rosell and now Josep Maria Bartomeu, have taken a back-seat in the heated debate currently taking place in the region. But Barca supporters aligned with former-president Joan Laporta are calling on the club to be more vocal in support of the referendum. Barcelona are top of La Liga after an unbeaten start to the season and beat Rayo Vallecano 2-0 on Saturday . Laporta, who was president from 2003 to 2010, wanted the club to be at the forefront of Catalan nationalist politics, which angered many fans, particularly those from other parts of Spain who felt alienated. A Barca spokesman was non-committal and said: 'It is a sensitive subject and the club won't get involved but the president is considering making a statement in the coming days.'","Spain's football league chief says Barca would technically have to leave La Liga if Catalonia becomes independent .

'He'll take part in everything with our football at this time unless the circumstances change,' head coach Jason Garrett said Thursday. 'You have to be careful with just accusations and allegations in this situation. When someone is officially charged or arrested for something, that's when it becomes a different situation in our minds. For now, he's a member of our football team and will take part in everything we do to this point.' The NFL, fresh off a raft of criticism for its handling of Ray Rice's domestic abuse arrest and the child abuse charges against Adrian Peterson, has launched its own investigation. League officials have offered to interview the alleged victim 'on a confidential and appropriate basis to obtain more information' about the case, a league spokesman said. Celebrity attorney Gloria Allred is representing the woman Spillman is accused of raping and has called for him to be taken off the field. Spillman, No. 37, has appeared in two games since the alleged assault and has continued to practice with the Cowboys. He is pictured here on Thursday . She also bashed the NFL for making public a later she sent to the league and questioned whether an interview with the alleged victim would indeed be kept confidential. On the same day that Spillman was accused of rape, he flew with the Cowboys to St. Louis, where he played against the Rams. Last Sunday he played against the New Orleans Saints. Team officials have refused to say when exactly they learned that Spillman had been accused of sexual assault. 'I'm not going to make any comment on an investigation where there've been no arrests or charges made,' coach  Garrett said. 'Having said that, we've been very clear with our team about consequences that there will be if there is a situation where charges or arrests are made for a crime. We've been clear about that. That doesn't apply in this particular case.'","Dallas Cowboys  player C.J. Spillman is under investigation but hasn't been arrested or charged after a report of an alleged sexual assault .

"Rio Ferdinand has questioned whether football has the power, or indeed the will, to eradicate racism following the shameful scenes involving Chelsea fans on the Paris metro earlier this week. Footage emerged late on Tuesday night of a group of supporters twice pushing a black man off the carriage before chanting 'we're racist, we're racist, we're racist and that's the way we like it' as Chelsea drew 1-1 with PSG in the Champions League. QPR defender Ferdinand, who was himself embroiled in a race row after Chelsea captain John Terry was found guilty by the FA of racially abusing brother Anton, described the scenes in Paris as disgraceful and insists it is the job of society, not football, to do more. A man attempts to board  but is refused entry by supporters  travelling to the Champions League tie in Paris . QPR defender Rio Ferdinand says society must do more in the fight against racism . The man attempts to reason with the passengers, who prevent him from getting on to the Paris Metro train . Former England international Ferdinand pictured with team-mates Leroy Fer (left) and Alex McCarthy (right) 'The racist scene on the metro with the Chelsea fans-disgraceful behaviour obviously,' The former England international tweeted. 'But can football change this? Does it have the power? 'Does football want to change this? Do the people in the game that hold the power really want to put the hard yards in to eradicate racism? 'Football has come a long way since the 70's & 80's but are we all guilty of becoming a bit complacent? 'Football has done a lot over the years to combat racism..but society has to do more to make change or is there too much hatred in society?'","Rio Ferdinand describes shocking scenes in Paris as 'disgraceful'

"Josh Parsons, identified on Twitter as one of the Chelsea fans on a Paris Metro carriage when a black man was shoved off, is a 'vocal' UKIP supporter who once enjoyed a pint with Nigel Farage. The former public schoolboy posed for a photo with Farage outside a central London pub which was posted on Instagram with the caption: 'UKIP BOYS! What a geezer'. City worker Parsons was identified as one of the group seen pushing the commuter off the train on Tuesday while a chant of 'We're racist, we're racist, and that's the way we like it' is heard in shocking footage. The Chelsea fan pictured on a train where fans were heard singing a racist chant, Josh Parsons, published a picture of himself having a drink with Nigel Farage with the caption: UKIP BOYS! 'What a geezer' Friends said Josh Parsons, left, who attended £30,000-a-year Millfield School appears (circled) in this image from the horrifying video . It came as the Frenchman pushed off the Metro train was revealed to be Souleymane S, 33, who told Le Parisien newspaper: 'These Chelsea supporters should be punished', and confirmed he was making a formal criminal complaint. The married father of three, who comes from a Mauritanian background, said he intends to visit a police station in the French capital to make a complaint on Thursday. Mr Parsons, a former pupil of Millfield School, where fees are £11,150 a term for boarders, studies business at Regent's University London, a friend said. Ash Williams wrote on Twitter: 'That is Josh Parsons in the black jacket (second from right) season ticket holder.' His former school, in Street, Somerset, was attended by James Hewitt, singer Lily Allen and several sports stars. Finance worker Josh Parsons is just as '21-year-old little boy who was in the wrong place at the wrong time', his boss said . He now works for the Business and Commercial Finance Club in central London. Yesterday, Mr Parsons' social media profiles had been taken down and his family did not respond to enquiries. A friend said that he was a backer of UKIP, but the party said today they 'have no idea who he is', and said the picture was taken in a chance meeting outside a London pub. Speaking outside his Mayfair office this morning, his boss Miranda Khadr said Mr Parsons would not be coming into work this morning. She said: 'He is very scared at the moment and he called me to say he is not coming in today. 'He is not that type of person at all (to have taken part in racist chants), he works with me and I'm not English. 'He is a 21-year-old little boy who was in the wrong place at the wrong time.' A second man on the metro train stood behind Mr Parsons was named locally at Jordan Munday, from south-east London. There is no suggestion that either was involved in the pushing of the passenger or the racist chanting. However, having been inside the carriage during the incident, both will be key witnesses for the police. Prosecutors have already launched a criminal enquiry for 'voluntary racial violence on public transport', which is punishable by up to three years in prison and a fine equivalent to £33,000. Speaking for the first time, Souleymane – who said he was attacked 'because of the colour of my skin' – said: 'I didn't know that I was filmed. The fact that it is being talked about has given me the courage to go and make a complaint to the police. 'These people, these English supporters ought to be found, punished and ought to be locked up. What happened should not go unpunished.' Souleymane lives in the Val-d'Oise department to the north of Paris, and was on his way home from his job close to the Richelieu-Drouot Metro station, in central Paris, soon after 7pm on Tuesday evening. He tried to get on to a train, but found it packed with Chelsea fans on their way to watch the London side's European Champions League game against Paris St Germain. Chelsea fan Jordan Munday has been named locally as also being on the train.  There is no suggestion he was involved in the pushing of the passenger or the racist chanting but could be a key witness for police . Police in France and Britain are working to identify the football fans captured in this film . The Chelsea supporters were filmed pushing a black man off the packed train at Richelieu-Drouot station on the Paris Metro . He told Le Parisien: 'I wanted to get into the carriage but a group of English fans blocked me and pushed me away. 'I tried to force my way on, I kept trying to get back on. In the scramble, I lost my phone. They told me things in English but I did not really understand the meaning of their words. 'I don't speak a word of English. I understood that they were Chelsea fans, and I made the connection with the PSG match, which was taking place the same evening. 'I also understood that they were attacking me because of the colour of my skin. You know, I live with racism, I was not really surprised by what happened to me, even if it was a first in the Metro. 'I stood in front of them for a long time. Someone came up to me afterwards and said I'd been brave to stand up to such people. 'I think the whole thing lasted about six or seven minutes. Referring to Metro workers, Souleymane said: 'After while, RATP staff intervened, but only to make sure there wasn't any fighting. 'Their aim was to make sure the traffic resumed on the line. No other passengers defended me, but anyway, what could anyone do? 'Then the train left, and I walked away, and waited for the next train. I went home and didn't mention what happened to anyone, not even my wife and children.' 'What was I meant to say to my children? That Dad was pushed and shoved in the Metro because he's black? That's hopeless'. The man can then be seen remonstrating with the fans, asking for them to let him on and appearing to insist there is sufficient room for him to stand - but he is then pushed off again . The footage was filmed before the Premier League team's 1-1 draw in a Champions League fixture with Paris Saint-Germain at Parc des Princes . The Prime Minister has called the video – shot after Chelsea drew with Paris Saint- Germain on Tuesday night in the UEFA Champions League – 'extremely disturbing'. Chelsea Football Club labelled it 'abhorrent'. It evokes the hooliganism that plagued the team in the 1970s. Last night, UK police were hunting those pictured as Chelsea launched a hotline for fans to turn them in. They face three years in prison if caught in France, and Scotland Yard said it would consider barring them from matches for up to ten years. David Cameron said: 'I'm sure the French police will be looking at it very seriously.' The minute-long video was filmed by a British expatriate who sent it to The Guardian. In it, the black man attempts to board, but the gang shove him off. Chelsea's first black player, Paul Canonville has called for the men to be banned from football for life . The commuter, who is not wearing club colours, asks them to let him on. They shout and push him as he tries to board again. A black woman leaves by another door as chants of 'We're racist, we're racist, and that's the way we like it' start. Paul Nolan, who filmed the clip, told The Guardian: 'He was obviously completely shocked … I don't think he realised who they were. There definitely was a culture shock. I heard a couple of French guys saying: 'I can't believe this. It's insane.' The fans also chanted 'Where were you in World War Two?' at French passengers, he said. Chelsea's first black star, Paul Canoville, said the men must be banned for life – but a fan who was on the train claimed it was not a racist attack. Mitchell McCoy, 17, said: 'A few people were pushing him off because there wasn't much space. People were saying it was because he was black. It's not true at all. I think it's because he was a PSG fan.' Of the chanting, he said: 'That song was about John Terry. The only words I know is 'He's a racist, he's a racist'.' Terry was banned for four matches and fined £220,000 in 2012 for racially abusing then QPR star Anton Ferdinand. The Paris prosecutors' office said it was investigating 'racial violence on public transport', punishable by three years in prison and a £33,000 fine. There were also reports of UK fans singing anti-Semitic songs and imitating the sound of gas escaping, a vile reference to the Holocaust. Chelsea said it will 'take the strongest possible action' if the men are club members, adding: 'Such behaviour is abhorrent and has no place in football or society.'","Josh Parsons has been identified on social media as one of the supporters .

"The twin brother of PC David Rathband – the policeman blinded by gunman Raoul Moat – paid a tearful tribute to his sibling at a memorial service yesterday, saying: ‘I have lost half of me.’ Darren Rathband, 44, comforting his brother’s children Mia, 13, and Ashley, 19, told a congregation of more than 800 mourners: ‘Every day grief puts on a new face.’ PC Rathband was in his patrol car in July 2010 when he was shot twice by Moat. Time to take him home: Ashley, 19, and Mia Rathband, 13, are comforted at the service alongside their uncle Darren, who suggested that his twin had found 'support outside of the marriage' Sad occasion: Emergency workers who were on duty on the night that Pc David Rathband was shot carry his coffin as it arrives at his memorial service at St Nicholas Cathedral, Newcastle . Upsetting: David Rathband's twin brother Darren listens to the emotional service . He was found hanged at home in Blyth, Northumberland, on February 29. It is believed he was devastated by the collapse of his marriage and in . continual pain from his injuries. His wife Kath – from whom he had . separated – was not at the service. She will attend his funeral next Saturday in his home town of Stafford. Hundreds of well-wishers brought Newcastle city centre to a standstill as the coffin bearing his cap, draped in a Union flag with his call sign, Tango 190, spelt out in flowers, was driven to St Nicholas Cathedral. David Rathband's estranged wife Kath refused to attend his memorial service because of the the policeman's relationship with a woman he met through his charity work. Kath, 42, has been hit hard by claims that she didn't support her husband in his darkest moments and has moved to defend herself. Their 20-year marriage ended when Kath discovered David, 44, had been seeing another woman. 'At first he denied the extent of the relationship, and she was prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt,' a source close to the family told The Sunday Mirror. 'But when he eventually admitted it she made it clear there was no chance of a reconciliation and asked for a divorce. 'The guilt Kath feels now is immense. But she also feels it is unfair to lay the blame with her when people don't know the facts.' The family friend also revealed that Kath gave the couple's children the option of staying away from the service but the pair decided at the last minute that they would attend. Kath has also employed public relations guru Max Clifford to help put across her side of the story . Inside, mourners included Police Minister Nick Herbert and Northumbria Chief Constable Sue Sim. Earlier, Mr Rathband – a police officer in Australia – formally clocked his brother off from what would have been his last shift. He closed his memorial tribute saying: ‘It’s time to take my brother home.’ Before the service Darren, who organised the service as a . celebration of Pc Rathband's life, watched as the . pall-bearers from each of the three emergency services brought out the . coffin and carried it the short distance into the church. During his heartbreaking speech watched by about 800 people he said: 'I have lost half of me. 'You don't get over it, you just get through it. 'Every day grief puts on a new face. 'My brother said to me ""you're a good brother"", I say to my brother ""you're a great brother"". 'It is time to take my brother home.' On the way to the cathedral, the . hearse stopped at Etal Lane police station, on the outskirts of . Newcastle, where Pc Rathband was based. It was there Darren booked him off the shift he always intended to complete. The Dean of Newcastle, the Very . Reverend Chris Dalliston, welcomed mourners to today's service by saying: . 'We come to give thanks for David's life and to recognise the cost he . and others have to pay in the call of duty.' Touching: Pc Rathband's twin brother Darren  pays his respects during the memorial service . Difficult day: Darren Rathband, Pc Rathband's twin, is visibly upset as he sits alongside his coffin outside Etal Lane police station . Respectful: Northumbria Police officers line up to pay their respects to PC David Rathband as his coffin passes the police station where he worked . Paying respects: Darren was met by the Assistant Chief Constable of Northumbria Police Steve Ashman, right, at Etal Lane police station . Honouring one of their own: The cortege carrying Pc David Rathband leaves the police station for the cathedral . Calls were made to better protect 999 workers injured in the line of duty during today's memorial service. The Government should introduce Rathband's Law to ensure emergency services personnel who are hurt while helping others do not struggle for financial security. The calls were made in a speech by Pc Rathband's friend Tony Horne, a former DJ and ghost-writer of his autobiography Tango 190. Despite being left blind, Pc Rathband set up the Blue Lamp Foundation to help other police officers, paramedics or firefighters injured by a criminal act while at work. In a moving, heartfelt speech, Mr Horne said: 'For me, it would be a beautiful irony and job done if legislation was passed so that there was no need for a Blue Lamp Foundation. 'Rathband's Law, ensuring that all injured servicemen in the line of duty should not want or wait for financial security and emotional support from now until the end of time.' Mr Horne directly called on politicians to make supporting injured personnel law, saying: 'If you are a public figure who has stood by David sincerely in support, or as a cynical photo opp, your time is now and your duty is to make sure that there are no empty promises and hollow words - make the ethos of the Blue Lamp Foundation a political reality.' Carly Fee, a humanist celebrant, . said: 'David served the North East for 12 years. He put himself at risk . every day for the greater good.' She added: 'One minute he was living an ordinary life - a dad, a husband, a copper. 'The next he was thrust into the . public eye - a celebrity, guest of honour at sporting events, a national . hero who got a five minute standing ovation at the Pride of Britain . Awards. 'Hero worship left David bemused and . befuddled, he couldn't get his head around it. 'He swore, without a hint . of false modesty, he was just a normal bloke.' Jos Forester-Melville, a member of . the public who helped at the scene of a terrible road traffic accident . in Northumberland in which two women died said Pc Rathband, the first . officer at the scene, showed tremendous compassion in the days and weeks . that followed. She said: 'David was at that time the kindest and most caring person I could have wished for. 'He spent considerable time talking and listening, making sure I understood I had done what I could.' Tony Horne, a former DJ and ghost-writer of Pc Rathband's autobiography Tango 190 gave a moving speech during the service. Having listened to Pc Rathband relive . the horror of being shot for the book, he said: 'I knew then that he had . seen too much, and I feared this moment would come.' He added: 'It's to his credit that he fought so long. 'Of . that night in July 2010, my friend looked danger in the eye and was not . found wanting when asked to make the ultimate sacrifice, displaying . bravery in a split second that collectively most of us will struggle to . match in a lifetime. Showing support: Actor Tim Healey, left, arrives at the service to celebrate Pc David Rathband's life . Tragedy: Pc David Rathband, pictured here with his wife Kath who he had separated from . Gunman: Fugitive Raoul Moat shot PC Rathband in the face while he was sat in his patrol car in July 2010 . 'Congratulations, David, on every day that you lived after. You really were playing on well into added time.' Mr Horne called on Northumbria Police to accept it made mistakes on the night his friend was shot. 'Unprecedented and testing circumstances I accept, but I urge you now, to tell the whole story of the mistakes that night and finally come forward and say publicly ""Sorry David, we should have avoided what happened to you"". 'You owe that to your fallen officer.' He went on to call on the media to stop naming the gunman who devastated Pc Rathband and his family's lives. 'My friend is called David Rathband - everybody knows his name, and how he became a hero,' he said. 'Let his name, not his attacker be remembered for generations to come. 'We must move from the shadow of that . evil and remember him always for his good in society rather than the . wickedness bestowed upon him.' Mr Horne also spoke warmly about the . officer's widow, Kath, saying: 'I want to say on the record what a . tremendous woman you are.' Last picture: Pc Rathband, pictured in a Twitter image, suns himself in Australia during his recent ten-week trip . He finished: 'As a society, David, we owe you a debt of thanks. So many people in life pass through our worlds - here today, gone tomorrow. 'David may be gone today, but he is very much here in all my tomorrows. 'Rest in peace my friend. I love you, and you're safe now.' As the hearse drove away, met with . public applause a yellow and red Northumbria Police badge tribute could be . seen. Policing Minister Nick Herbert said afterwards: 'I think it is right . that we remember this brave police officer and what he did for the . community that he served.' Chief Constable Sue Sim added: 'He was gunned down in tragic circumstances doing the job of constable he loved. 'My heart goes out to Kath and the children and the rest of the family.'","Shoppers and well-wishers stand in silence as cortege carrying police officer's coffin makes its way to Newcastle's St Nicholas' Cathedral .

"This is the woman who looks so much like popstar Nicki Minaj that even her husband struggles to tell them apart. Make-up artist Ashlea Sherman-Wyzard has regularly been mobbed in public due to her likeness to the pint-sized singer. Ashlea, who lives in Monroe, Louisiana, was first told she looked like Minaj by Ray J - Kim Kardashian's ex - and these days the comparisons come thick and fast. Ashlea has not ruled out turning her incredible likeness to the Roman's Revenge singer into a full-time career . ''It's scary sometimes how much they look alike,' her husband says of his wife's resemblance to  Whip It singer . Getting ready for the close-up: The make-up artist has appeared in several music videos . And having appeared in several music videos, she was even turned down for one in which the Superbass singer was due to star - because producers thought she looked too similar. But it isn't only strangers who have trouble telling them apart - even husband Kasheef finds it hard to spot the difference. He said: 'I had a text message from her sister and she made some kind of collage image and the faces were put right against each other and looking at it quickly I thought it was Nicki Minaj, or Nicki Minaj was her. The 28-year-old doesn't mind being stopped and will happily take photos with those shocked by her likeness . Scary resemblance: Ashlea at a Halloween party where naturally, she went dressed as the Anaconda singer . Having fun with it: Ashlea says she has ruled out Minaj-style butt implants - at least for the time being . Spot the difference: Nicki Minaj (left) doppelgänger Ashlea Sherman-Wyzard has regularly been mobbed in public due to her likeness to the pint-sized singe . 'It's scary sometimes how much they look alike.' But being a mirror image of one of the world's most lusted-after women also has its downsides. The 28-year-old was targeted by Minaj superfans, known as Barbz, after a picture comparing the two was posted online, with Ashlea receiving thousands of abusive tweets - including death threats. She said: 'A lot of Nicki Minaj's fans started to see it and when they saw my name on it, they immediately took to my Twitter and started commenting and harassing me and saying ""Nicki Minaj is this fabulous person, how could you dare compare yourself to her, who do you think you are?""' But the South Carolina-born Ashlea got through the online bullying with help from her husband of two years Kasheef. The pair even played the Minaj track 'Right By Your Side' at their wedding. Startling resemblance: Ashlea is open to a career as a Nicki Minaj lookalike but she says she 'wouldn't do anything to bash her or make fun of her, or make her look bad.' 'It's been an interesting experience being compared to a celebrity,' Ashlea says . Ashlea admits that both her husband and parents have trouble telling them apart, but is keen to stress that she is her own woman. And while she isn't adverse to surgery, having had a breast reconstruction after a lump was removed, she has ruled out Minaj-style butt implants - at least for the time being.

"The crowds of bargain hunters that rush through store doors the day after Thanksgiving have thinned out. U.S. shoppers spent $9.1 billion at stores on Black Friday, according to data out Saturday from research firm ShopperTrak. That's a drop of 7 per cent compared with the same day last year. But it's too early to call the holiday shopping season a dud, said Bill Martin, ShopperTrak' s co-founder. Sales on Thanksgiving jumped 24 per cent to $3.2 billion. And overall sales for the two days are expected to slip half a percent to $12.29 billion. U.S. shoppers spent $9.1 billion at stores on Black Friday, according to data out Saturday from research firm ShopperTrak . The figures don't include online transactions. For the second straight year, the report suggests that more people avoided the crowds on Black Friday by avoiding time at home on Thanksgiving Day. This year, many large retail stores decided to open their doors to eager shoppers for extended hours on the holiday. 'People are changing their behavior,' Martin said. 'We've seen this for two years in a row now. Stores opening on Thanksgiving are simply eroding sales from Black Friday.' The popularity of shopping online has also lured people away from brick-and-mortar stores. For the second straight year, the report suggests that more people avoided the crowds on Black Friday by avoiding time at home on Thanksgiving Day . In a separate report out Saturday, IBM said online sales for Black Friday climbed 9.5 per cent over the same day last year. More than one of every four transactions were made using a smartphone or tablet computer. Some people saw no reason to rush to the stores before the weekend. In Phoenix, Elaine Vanas and her daughter, Christine, were out picking up coats on Saturday, saying they disliked the long lines on Black Friday. At JC Penney, the two found a $50 house coat for Christine's grandmother for $20, and bought another $200 coat for $20. The National Retail Federation predicts that sales for the last two months of the year will hit $616.9 billion, an increase of 4.1 per cent over the same period of 2013 . 'I'm not cheap but I'm frugal,' Elaine Vanas said. Retail businesses have highs hopes for the holiday shopping season. The National Retail Federation predicts that sales for the last two months of the year will hit $616.9 billion, an increase of 4.1 per cent over the same period of 2013. That would count as the biggest increase for that sales period since 2011. But it would still be slower than the 6 per cent pace typical before 2007, the year the Great Recession started.","Sales on Thanksgiving jumped 24 per cent to $3.2 billion.

"One of Britain's most expensive country homes has gone on the market - and it really is fit for a Queen. The Grade I listed Mynde Park, set in a 1,180-acre estate, has a right royal price tag - a princely £15m. But the estate agents handling the sale say there is no shortage of potential buyers wanting to view the property. Home fit for royalty: Mynde Park is Grade I listed and was completely renovated over a three year project by the current owners. The Queen held a picnic here in rural Herefordshire for 3,000 guests in 2003 . It is one of Britain's most expensive country homes and has gone on the market for £15million. Craig Hamilton, the renowned architect, oversaw the restoration including the kitchen and study extension with private walled garden . ‘The King’s Hall was described by Nikolaus Pevsner (architectural historian) as 'the finest room in Herefordshire', and has vast ceiling heights and remarkable plaster work. It takes up a large proportion of the house. Listed: The house has 12 bedrooms, 10 of them ensuites, a drawing room, library, study and morning room. The spacious master bedroom has two dressing rooms, bathroom and shower . Stately: The estate agents handling the sale say there is no shortage of potential buyer. The extended kitchen is a wonderful family space with dining and sitting area with door out to the garden . And the guided tour can take up to four hours because there's so much to see. The Queen held a picnic at the property in rural Herefordshire for 3,000 guests. Clive Hopkins, head of Farms and Estates for Knight Frank estate agents, said: 'It is a unique property, one of the finest anywhere in the country. 'We are getting interest from international clients, from Eastern Europe and other parts of the world.' The dining room retains its original panelling, has a fireplace at either end and would comfortably seat at least 24 people . The guided tour of the house can take up to four hours because there's so much to see. The drawing room, off the great hall, is one of the many entertaining spaces in the house . Mynde Park dates back to 1350 and was once the home of Walter Pye, attorney-general to Charles I. The library room enjoys views over the surrounding countryside . But the house also has 12 bedrooms, 10 of them ensuites, a drawing room, library, study, morning room, billiard room, games room, two kitchens and various cellars. The London office of Knight Frank describe the house near the village of Much Dewchurch as 'deceptively compact' inside. A separate five-bedroomed house - the Little Mynde - stands in the grounds, along with six cottages and an entrance lodge. The manor is approached along a mile-long private 'carriage drive' with views of the swimming pool, gardens, lake and the surrounding Herefordshire countryside. Local historians said Mynde Park dates back to 1350 and was once the home of Walter Pye, attorney-general to Charles I. Mynde Park house is set in 1,180-acres of prime arable land with stunning undulating countryside . Mynde Park has views looking out over its own lake . The house was later acquired by the Duke of Chandos who, in 1709, added the King's Hall with its Buggatti and Attari plasterwork. It is currently owned by Caroline and Audley Twiston-Davies, whose daughter Antonia was a God-daughter of Princess Diana. The Twiston-Davies family spent four years and millions of pounds restoring the manor house to its former glory 10 years ago.

"A British photographer's stunning shot of a lionfish swimming by the wreck of merchant navy ship in Egypt, and the haunting image of a harbor seal floating in a kelp forest of San Diego, are among the winning entries of an underwater photography competition. More than 650 underwater images were submitted - from 23 countries including the UK and Italy - for the 2013 Annual Underwater Photography Contest by the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine & Atmospheric Science (RSMAS). The winners were chosen by a panel of experts including underwater photographer Nicole Wang, photographer and University of Miami lecturer Myron Wang and Rosenstiel School Marine Biology and Fisheries scientist Dr. Jiangang Luo. This image of a harbor seal was taken in a kelp forest at Cortes bank near San Diego in California by Kyle McBurnie. It was the overall winning image submitted to the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science's (RSMAS) underwater photography competition in Miami . This shot of anemone shrimp was taken in Puerto Galera in the Philippines by Beth Watson from Missouri. It was the winning picture in the RSMAS macro category. Most anemone shrimp live, and are totally dependent, on sea anemones. They are vulnerable to predators when they are not attached to their hosts and some lie parallel to the anemone's tentacles to camouflage themselves further . Photographs were judged in three . categories - macro, fish or marine animal portrait, wide-angle, plus the . best overall submission. There were also prizes for the best . University of Miami student photos and both first and second place went . to Laura Rock from Florida for her shot of goliath groupers spawning in . Jupiter, Florida and a great hammerhead shark. Third place went to Austin Gallagher who took a picture of an oceanic white tip shark near the Cat Island in the Bahamas. White . tips sharks are among the most dangerous in the world and were blamed . for the death of more than 800 sailors in 1945 after the torpedoing of . the USS Indianapolis in the Philippine Sea. The best overall photo was taken by . American Kyle McBurnie for his harbor seal seen peering through a kelp . forest near San Diego in California. The second place macro picture was this image of an emperor shrimp sat on top of two nudibranch molluscs. It was taken at Dinah's Beach in Papua New Guinea by Douglas Good from Pennsylvania. The nudibranches resemble the worms in 1986 film, Labyrinth. The word 'nudibranch' comes from the Latin nudus for naked, and the Greek, brankhia, which means gills . Whilst a pretty pink anemone shrimp snapped by American Beth Watson grabbed first place in the macro section. Other winning pictures include an . emperor shrimp photographed in Papua New Guinea and a spotty porcelain . crab taken by Italian Frederica Bambi. Spinner dolphins can be seen . swimming underwater in another photo, whilst a close-up of a young . lionfish got first place in the portrait section. The third place in the macro category of the RSMAS underwater photography competition went to Italian photographer Frederica Bambi. It shows a porcelain crab on an anemone at Pescador Island, Cebu in the Philippines. This porcelain crab's official name is Neopetrolisthes maculatus. The porcelain crab gets its nickname because of its delicate shell. They are typically less than 15 mm wide and readily lose limbs when attacked . A photographer from Bournemouth took this winning shot of a lionfish on the Thistlegorm wreck in the Red Sea. Alex Tattersall took the shot during a trip to Egypt and it won first place in the wide-angle category. The SS Thistlegorm was a British naval ship built in 1940 in England. She was sunk on 6 October 1941 near Ras Muhammad in the north African country and is now a well known diving site . The colourful purple and orange . lionfish seen swimming on the wreck of SS Thistlegorm was taken by Alex Tattersall from Bournemouth in Dorset. It won first place in the wide-angle category of annual Underwater Photography contest. SS Thistlegorm was British armed merchant navy ship built in 1940 by Joseph Thompson and Son in Sunderland. She was sunk on 6 October 1941 near Ras Muhammad in the Red Sea and is now a well known diving site. The remarkable pictures reveal a hidden world of colourful creatures of all shapes and sizes living deep beneath our oceans. Second place in the wide-angle category went to Joseph Tepper, from New York. It shows spinner dolphins swimming in a small inlet off the Kona coast of Hawaii. Dolphins work as a team to capture fish but they also hunt individually. They search for prey using echolocation, which is similar to sonar . Pietro Cremone from Itlay won third place in the wide-angle category. His entry shows a Raccoon butterfly fish and angelfish on a reef in the Red Sea near Sharm el Sheik in Egypt. Raccoon butterfly fish are also known as crescent-masked butterfly fish because of their patterns. They grow up to eight inches and can live for seven years . Tatttersall said: 'I took the photo when I was diving on a big wreck of a Second World War ship in the Red Sea in Egypt. 'I was about 20 metres down under the sea and took lots of shots but this was the one that came out the best. 'I love taking underwater pictures as . it is very peaceful and you have access to a hidden world which only a . small minority of people gets to see.' First place in the fish or marine animal portrait category was won by Steven Kovacs. This juvenile lionfish was shot during a night dive in Roatan in Honduras. Lionfish, also known as pterois, have red, white, creamy, or black bands to warn off predators such as moray eels and bluespotted cornetfish. They also have pectoral fins and venomous spiky fin rays . This greater blue-ringed octopus was photographed near Malapascua island in the Philippines. The image won second place in the fish or marine animal portrait category and was taken by Marcello DiFrancesco from Italy. The octopus is one of three species of venomous blue-ringed octopuses that produce venom in its salivary glands. The venom called tetrodotoxin causes paralysis and respiratory arrest and can lead to heart attacks in victims due to a lack of oxygen . The photography contest is open to . any amateur photographer who earns less than 20 per cent of their income . from selling photography. Each category awards a prize sum to . the top three entries - £163 ($250) for first place, £98 ($150) for . second place and £65 ($100) for entries that come third. Kyle McBurnie who won the best overall . prize was given a trip on a Blackbeard cruise to the Bahamas and £195 ($300). Third place in the fish or marine animal portrait category was taken by Judy Townsend. It shows a male dusky jawfish protecting his eggs inside his mouth. The image was taken at the Blue Heron Bridge in Riviera Beach in Florida. Jawfishes are called mouthbrooders, which meaning their eggs hatch in their mouths in a bid to protect them from predators. The eggs are typically kept in the fishes' mouths for between eight to 10 days before hatching . The best student entry in the RSMAS underwater photography competition was won by Laura Rock from Florida. It shows a  goliath grouper fish, official name, Epinephelus itajara, during the annual spawning event in Jupiter in Florida. Goliath groupers mainly eat mostly small, slow-moving fish and crustaceans. They can live to their 60s and begin to spawn when they reach about four feet long. They will travel long distances ¿ as much as 180 miles ¿ to reach summer spawning sites . Among the other rules RSMAS state that all photographs must be of marine life. No photographs of divers touching or stressing marine wildlife were acceptable. Photographs must not have been digitally edited or enhanced aside from basic brightness, contrast and cropping edits. Laura Rock from Florida also won second place in the student category with this shot of a great hammerhead shark in Bimini in Bahamas. The average great hammerhead grows to around 20 feet long. The great hammerhead rarely attacks humans but will defend itself when hunted for large fins. The fins are valuable in Asia as the main ingredient of shark fin soup . This photo of an oceanic white tip shark was taken by third place student winner Austin Gallagher, from Florida. He took the image near Cat Island in the Bahamas. Renowned oceanographer Jacques Cousteau labelled the white tips as 'the most dangerous of all sharks'. In 1945, after the torpedoing of the USS Indianapolis, whitetips were thought to be responsible for the deaths of up to 800 sailors .","More than 650 underwater images were submitted from 23 countries to the 2013 Annual .

"It's one of the most successful awareness campaigns that has ever run online, with people from Giselle Bundchen to George W. Bush to Bill Gates taking part. The ALS Ice Bucket Challenge has raised almost $US100 million ($A106.8 million) for people suffering with the condition better known as Lou Gehrig's Disease since it kicked off in late July. And while countless videos of celebrities, public figures and ordinary people have flooded the internet over the past month it has been hard to tell how this viral video campaign spread so far so quickly. Until now. David Hooker, a content manager who works for Hungarian presentation software company Prezi, created a detailed interactive that tracks the Ice Bucket Challenge from its inception in Florida to its spread throughout Hollywood. Scroll down for video . An employee at a software company created a detailed interactive that tracks the Ice Bucket Challenge from its inception in Florida to its spread throughout Hollywood . The challenge started with Charles Kennedy, a golfer from Florida, who was responding to a friend who told him 'pour ice over your head and I'll donate to the charity of your choice' The challenge started with Charles Kennedy, a golfer from Florida, who was responding to a friend who told him 'pour ice over your head and I'll donate to the charity of your choice'. He chose ALS because his cousin is a sufferer of the disease. He then challenged his cousin's wife, and the challenges eventually reached New York-based ALS activist Pat Quinn who documents his battle with the disease on the website Quinn 4 The Win. Through Mr Quinn's network it spread to former Boston college baseball player Pete Frates, also an ALS sufferer, whose friend Corey Griffin reportedly raised $US100,000 on behalf of his friend before he died in tragic diving accident almost two weeks ago. Dan Quinn, whose brother is New York-based ALS activist Pat Quinn, was one of the first to do the challenge . Corey Griffin had just raised $100,000 for ALS in honor of his friend, former Boston college baseball player and ALS sufferer Pete Frates, when he died in a tragic diving accident . After the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge spread around Boston sports teams, Giselle Bundchen (model and wife of New England Patriots player Tom Brady) took part . The challenge then spread around athletes all over Boston including New England Patriots player Julian Edelman. He nominated teammate Tom Brady, and it eventually spread to his model wife Giselle Bundchen as well as singer Justin Timberlake. From there, it exploded. Bundchen challenged US Vogue editor Anna Wintour, photographer Mario Testino and pop star Shakira. Justin Timberlake was also one of the first celebrities to take part in the challenge . Kate Moss did the ice bucket challenge in St Tropez, France after receiving her nomination from fashion photographer Mario Testino . Tom Hanks captioned an ice bucket video of himself shared on Facebook as 'Who Dares Wins. Hanx.' Since then celebrities including James Franco, David Beckham, Selena Gomez, Ryan Seacrest, Taylor Swift, Gwyneth Paltrow, Lena Dunham, Emma Stone and Ben Affleck have been nominated to do the challenge and they've all taken part. Although the rules state you either donate to ALS or pour an ice bucket over your head, many have done both, and the awareness raised by the celebrities' videos has translated into millions of dollars for the ALS Association. On Wednesday an association spokeswoman, Carrie Munk, told AP the trick now is figuring out how to spend the windfall wisely. Research, care and advocacy are the group's three main missions. 'We realise there are responsibilities that come with being good stewards of these dollars,' she said. Reese Witherspoon did the challenge for her friend Nanci who was just diagnosed with ALS . Henry Cavill took on the challenge while on the set of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice .

"A tiny spider that builds much bigger elaborate decoy spiders and hangs them in its web to fool predators has been discovered in the Peruvian Amazon. The artful arthropod crafts its decoys from dead insects, debris and leaves in what scientists suspect is a defence mechanism to avoid being eaten. It is believed to be a new species of Cyclosa, a genus which includes other sculpting arachnids but none of which of which have been observed to build replicas with multiple, spidery legs. Cunning: The spider sits above its decoy in a flood plain surrounding Peru's Tambopata Research Centre . Biologist and science teacher Phil Torres discovered the apparently novel spider in September as he led tourists in a floodplain surrounding Peru's Tambopata Research Centre. 'From afar, it appears to be a medium sized spider about an inch across, possibly dead and dried out, hanging in the center of a spider web along the side of the trail,' he wrote in a blog post for eco-tourism firm Rainforest Expeditions. Such sights are not out of the ordinary for the Amazon, he writes, but as he approached the apparently decomposing arthropod it began to wobble back and forth as it it was alive. 'Step in even closer and things start to get weird- that spider form you were looking at is actually made up of tiny bits of leaf, debris, and dead insects,' 'The confusion sets in. How can something be constructed to look like a spider, how is it moving, and what kind of creature made this!? 'It turns out the master designer behind this somewhat creepy form is in fact a tiny spider' Never seen before: The spider (pictured left in close up) is believed to be a new species in the genus Cyclosa, which includes other sculpting arachnids, but none of which have been observed to build such life-like replicas . Mr Torres, who divides his time . between Peru and Southern California, told Wired the discovery was . unlike anything he had ever seen before. 'It blew my mind,' he said. Mr . Torres contacted Linda Raynor, an arachnologist at Cornell University, . who agreed it was an unusual find. She told Wired it was likely to be an . unidentified species. Even . among the decoy-building species of Cyclosa, she said, decoys with legs . and the web-shaking behaviour have not been observed before. After . speaking with experts, Mr Torres returned to the trails around . Tambopata and found a further 25 specimens of the novel spider in the . same floodplain. Searches in other areas nearby did not find any of the spiders, he added, suggesting they have a restricted range. New to science: Biologist and science teacher . Phil Torres discovered the spider in September as he led tourists in a . floodplain around Tambopata River in the Peruvian Amazon . Limited range: After speaking with experts, Mr Torres returned to the trails around Tambopata and found a further 25 specimens of the novel spider in the same floodplain, but none further afield . William Eberhard, an entomologist at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute who studies web-building, said he had never before seen a structure like the ones found in the Amazonian. Cyclosa are known for decoy building, but most of their constructions are clumpy rather than something which resembles and actual spider. 'Known Cyclosa don’t have that spider-with-leg looking thing, which is why we think it’s a new species,' Mr Torres said. He hopes to return to the area in January with a permit to collect samples, in preparation for submitting a study and getting the new species officially recognised.","Apparent new species found in a floodplain in the Peruvian Amazon .

"A block of flats which has been left teetering on the brink of collapse by floods this week is set to be demolished. Spencer Court in Newburn, Tyne and Wear, was left with its foundations totally exposed after extreme rainfall ripped away the ground from underneath the building. But the flooding misery is set to ease in most of Britain over the next few days - with sunshine expected in many areas for the rest of today and tomorrow. Scroll down for video . Doomed: Spencer Court in Tyneside (pictured) will be demolished after its foundations were washed away by raging flood waters . Evacuation: Residents who were evacuated from the flats have been told their homes will have to be knocked down because of safety fears . Devastating: The flooding ripped out the foundations from the modern flats - leaving them unsafe to return to . Deluge: Flash flooding left much of Newburn Village under water causing extensive damage (pictured) Residents of the stricken flats - who were previously been evacuated - were told last night that their homes would soon be lost as engineers confirmed that 'plans were being put in place' for the demolition of the block. The revelation caused an outcry among home owners in Spencer Court and the surrounding blocks of flats who were evacuated as a result of the flooding earlier in the week. Some residents who had been allowed back into their homes on Wednesday were asked to leave again yesterday over fears for their safety. Leanne and Graham Bullock, who live in Mill Vale, adjacent to Spencer Court flats, said they are unsure of their future. Mr Bullock, 27, said: 'My wife is 35-weeks pregnant and we just don't know what is happening. She doesn't need this stress - we just need answers.' Weather forecast . Leanne, 23, said: 'I don't know if we are going to be able to live there again - it's very stressful and upsetting.' Northumberland Estates which represents the Duke of Northumberland's business interests and owns part of the land where the flooding has taken place, apologised for the problems on the site. The underground culvert which collapsed is in the section the company owns. A spokesman said: 'We are desperately sorry for the residents of Spencer Court and Mill Vale that this has happened yet again. 'Since . the culvert collapse, we have been working very hard to resolve what is . an extremely complex engineering problem, given that the culvert lies . 12 metres below ground, and the land itself is proving to be highly . unstable.

Dunelm Homes, who also own some of . the land, spoke to affected residents, but anger flared as many felt . they were not being listened to. Mill . Vale homeowner Elaine Boynton, who had been evacuated but since let . back into her home, said: 'Nothing has been achieved and still nobody is . admitting liability. 'We bought houses in good faith. Dunelm has just taken our money and we just feel really unsafe. No timescale was given on when the demolition of the block may take place. A .

We hope to achieve this in the next three to four months.' Water levels are finally receding in rivers swollen by the most intense September storm for 30 years. Heavy downpours in parts of the UK since Sunday have raised river levels and flooded hundreds of homes and businesses. A couple may have drowned trying to rescue their dog from a swollen river near Wrexham, north Wales. It is feared that the couple entered the . river trying to rescue one of their dogs and drowned in fast currents . caused by the heavy rainfall. Alicia Williams, 25, who has a young daughter, and boyfriend David Platt, also 25, were found dead on Wednesday by the River Clywedog, near Wrexham, north Wales, where they had been walking their dogs.

All of the couple's dogs were recovered safely. And an 11-year-old by struck by lightning outside his school in Swindon, Wiltshire, is in a stable condition in hospital. Around 570 properties have been flooded across England and Wales because of the storm, and railways and roads were swamped by high water levels. River levels remain high in the areas worst hit by the bad weather, including in York where around 100 properties are flooded and the Ouse has reached a peak of more than five metres above normal - the second highest level recorded. But the Environment Agency [EA] said many river levels have now peaked and are expected to fall throughout the morning. The EA said there were 27 flood warnings and 34 flood alerts in place, mostly across the North East. The Met Office said the most intense September storm since 1981 is the result of the unusual position of the jet stream: a high-altitude band of wind which steers weather systems. It caused heavy rain and floods in the summer when it shifted further south than normal. The Met Office expects the outlook to improve in the coming days, with weather returning to the mixed picture . of settled periods and low pressure systems which the country would . normally expect at this time of year. The forecast for the rest of today is . for a mixture of bright spells and shows across Britain - a Met Office . spokeswoman has said - although some lighter showers are expected in . some northern areas of England and parts of Scotland and Northern . Ireland. The weather will be fine in many areas with temperatures possibly reaching up to 16C or 18C. Tomorrow is expected to be the best day of the weekend weather-wise with sunshine again expected in many areas. The wind will also be lighter . tomorrow making it feel warmer, although there will be one or two . showers across north west England and parts of Scotland. On Sunday cloud and rain is expected to return, affecting many areas of Britain, for at least some parts of the day. Heavier rain will fall in north west England and south west Scotland - but southern areas will be mainly dry. However, the wet weather will move southwards in the evening. Temperatures on Sunday could reach up to 19C in London. The weather is forecast to become . changeable again into next week, although the Met Office says it will be . normal 'Autumnal' conditions. There will be a mixture of sunshine . and showers on Monday and Tuesday, although rainy spells will lengthen . moving into Wednesday.","Spencer Court to be demolished after being left 'unsafe' by flood damage .

Speaking to Fox News off camera, Brown's mother, Leslie McSpadden, said she was 'furious' by what has unfolded. She . told the TV station that the violence was 'disrespecting the memory of . her son' and was not helping her cause, which is to seek justice for her . son and peace for her family. The . devastated mother, who is still in shock after losing her don, added . that she was even scared to go home last night because of the chaos in . the streets. People . smashed car windows and looted armloads of goods from stores after the . vigil for the unarmed black teen who was shot and killed by a police . officer on Saturday. Devastated: Lesley McSpadden, pictured left on Sunday, said she did not condone the looting that took place after a vigil for her son . 'Shot 8 times': The 18-year-old was killed during an altercation with police on Saturday. He was unarmed and according to his mother was shot eight times . The . candlelight gathering was held in Ferguson, St Louis for Brown, who . police said was shot multiple times after a scuffle involving an . officer, Brown and another person in the predominantly black suburb of . the city. After . the vigil, which attracted thousands, some people looted a convenience . store, while several other stores along a main road near the shooting . scene were broken into and looted, including a check-cashing store, a . boutique and a small grocery store. People . were seen carrying bags of food and toilet paper and TV footage showed . streams of people walking out of a liquor store carrying bottles of . alcohol. In some cases protesters were also standing on top police cars and taunting officers who stood stoic, often in riot gear. Other witnesses reported seeing people vandalize police cars and kick in windows. Television footage showed windows busted out of a TV station van. 'Right now, the small group of people are creating a huge mess,' Ferguson's mayor, James Knowles, told St. Louis KTVI-TV. 'Contributing to the unrest that is going on is not going to help. ... We're only hurting ourselves, only hurting our community, hurting our neighbors. There's nothing productive from this.' As the investigation of Brown's death progresses, 'we understand people want to vent their frustrations. We understand they want to speak out,' Knowles added. 'We're going to obviously try to urge calm.' St Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley said there were no reports of injuries but confirmed widespread property damage. 'Right now I'm just worried about people, not property,' he said. At least 32 people had been arrested by the time the looting stopped, according to Fox News. Earlier in . the day, hundreds of protesters had gathered outside Ferguson Police . headquarters. Trouble brewing: A QuikTrip station appeared to bear the brunt of the group's hostilities Sunday evening as trouble broke out around 8:30 . 'Right now, the small group of people are creating a huge mess,' Ferguson's mayor, James Knowles, told St. Louis KTVI-TV . 'Contributing to the unrest that is going on is not going to help. ... We're only hurting ourselves, only hurting our community, hurting our neighbors. There's nothing productive from this,' Mayor Knowles said . At one point, many of them marched into an adjacent police . building, some chanting 'Don't shoot me' while holding their hands in . the air. Officers stood at the top of a staircase, but didn't use force and the crowd eventually left. County . Police Chief Jon Belmar said the shooting of Brown occurred after an officer . encountered two people on the street near an . apartment complex in Ferguson. Mr Belmar said one of the men pushed the officer back into his squad car and a struggle began. He added at least one shot was fired from the officer's gun inside the police car. Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson said authorities were still establishing what happened inside the police car. It was not clear if Brown was the man who struggled with the officer. The struggle spilled out into the street, where Brown was shot multiple times. He also said all shell casings found at the scene matched the officer's gun. Police are still investigating why the officer shot Brown, who police have confirmed was unarmed. Mr Jackson said the second person has not been arrested or charged, although authorities aren't sure if that person was unarmed. Photos of the chaos quickly turned up on social media, like these shots of a man smashing the glass of what appears to be a bus stop . St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley said there were no reports of injuries but confirmed widespread property damage. 'Right now I'm just worried about people, not property,' he said . Taking to the streets: The chaos broke out after what was largely a peaceful vigil in the name of the slain teen . Mr Jackson told KSDK-TV there's no apparent video footage of the shooting from a nearby apartment complex, or from any police cruiser dashboard cameras or body-worn cameras that the department recently bought but hasn't yet put in use. He added blood samples have been taken from Brown and the officer who shot him, with those toxicology tests expected to take weeks to complete. Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, said her son had graduated from high school and was about to enter a local college. She . said she doesn't understand why police didn't subdue him with a . club or Taser, and believes the officer involved should be fired and . prosecuted. Burn it down: Several car windows were smashed and stores were looted as people carried away armloads of goods. Video posted online by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch showed a convenience store on fire .

Police officers try to move on protestors, who gathered outside Ferguson police station on Sunday . The crowds then began to block the road preventing other traffic from passing through the street . 'I would like to see him go to jail with the death penalty,' she said, fighting back tears. The killing drew criticism from some . civil rights leaders, who referred to the 2012 racially charged shooting . of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by a Florida neighborhood watch organizer . who was acquitted of murder charges. McSpadden . has hired Benjamin Crump, the attorney who represented family of slain . Florida teen Trayvon Martin, to represent her family.

The Reverend Al Sharpton also called the shooting 'very disturbing' and said he planned to go to Ferguson to meet with the family. St. Louis County Police Department is in charge of the investigation, and . county executive Dooley said he will request an FBI investigation. The U.S. Justice . Department said Attorney General Eric Holder had also instructed staff to . monitor developments.

"Jackie Mason took a chunk of Obama's 'tukhus' for misleading the public about his signature health insurance overhaul . Jackie Mason, the aging comedian best known for his borscht-belt Jewish schtick, slammed President Obama on Sunday as a compulsive liar who sounds 'like a maniac in an asylum' when he talks about health care. 'He's saying things that nobody believes,' said Mason, 82, during an interview broadcast on WABC radio in New York. 'He was always lying every day of his life. Every time he talks it was a lie. The only time he tells the truth is when you didn't hear from him.' Mason took issue with Obama's repeated pledge that Americans who wanted to keep their health insurance plans would be able to do so even after the Affordable Care Act became law. The Washington Post has since awarded that promise its dreaded 'four Pinocchios' rating, the least-truthful grade its fact-checker offers. 'This is becoming so ridiculous, that even the biggest liar can’t top himself,' Mason said of Obama, the conservative World Net Daily website was first to report. 'He looks at you straight in the face, and tells you that if you want your plan, you got your plan, you keep your plan. Now, a month and a half later, you got no plan, you lost your plan, and he tells you you still got a plan.' 'It's such a ridiculous thing,' he added. 'The whole country's walking around wondering if this guy's really the president of a country. He sounds more like a maniac in an asylum.' 'If this is a president of a country, how come he's the only one in America who doesn't seem to know what's going on here?' SCROLL DOWN FOR AUDIO . Read my lips: Obama has taken flak for saying that Americans who liked their pre-Obamacare medical insurance plans would be allowed to keep them . Mason said he believes Obama's multiple statements that 'If you like your plan, you can keep your plan' are lies, not simple misstatements, as a weekend New York Times editorial alleged. 'Never did I expect a guy like this – the head of a country – to blatantly lie to your face,' he said, 'and then not only lie to your face, then lie about the fact that he never lied. Then lie again about the next lie he told.' Obama, said Mason, is 'the only guy in America who would have the nerve to lie this much.' Sunday's comments weren't the first time Mason has made headlines for attacking the president. During a stand-up performance in 2009 he referred to Obama using the Yiddish word 'schvartze,' which some commentators took as an outdated racial epithet. Others, including Mason, contended that the word is simply a literal translation of the word 'black.' 'Chris Rock has told a lot more jokes about whites than I have against blacks,' the cnoservative comic later said. 'What about the demeaning words blacks say about Jews? If it's a racist society, the white people are the ones being persecuted because they have to defend themselves.' Mason has never been a shrinking violet, but has become more and more vocal about his dislike of President Obama . Conservative commentators have made hay over cancellation letters going to millions of Americans who thought their existing health care plans would pass muster under the Affordable Care Act . In 2001 Mason attacked the president for holding a White House Hanukkah observance 12 days early so it wouldn't interrupt his family vacation. 'The way I see it,' Obama had said, 'we're just extending the holiday spirit. We're stretching it out. But we do have to be careful that your kids don't start thinking Hanukkah lasts 20 nights instead of eight. That will cause some problems.' Mason fired back. 'I don't even think he knew that he was talking about something that's Jewish,' he said days later. 'It could have been Muslim, it could have been altogether a religion he never even heard of. He doesn't know, he doesn't care. He's strictly in there to take a picture, and the picture could have been about anything . He claimed that the president only held the event because his Jewish advisors had told him '""Hanukkah is a good idea""' if he wanted to increase his appeal to Jewish voters in the following year's election. '""You don't have to go any place,""' he imagined them saying. '""We'll put down the tchotchke and you'll see a candle, you'll light it from this side,"" and that's enough information for him to accumulate without a teleprompter. So he did it in 10 minutes.' Old-timer: Jackie Mason's heyday was in the 1960s and 1970s, shown here (R) with legendary variety show host Ed Sullivan (L) 'You want me to tell you the truth?' he said then. 'I don’t think he cares, or knows or remembers which Hanukkah it is, or what Hanukkah means.' In 2012 Mason attacked Obama after his open-mic gaffe and was heard telling Russian President Dmitry Medvedev that he would have more 'flexibility' in his policymaking after he was re-elected. The president, he claimed, had showed himself to be 'a fake and a fraud' who 'hates this country.' He also called Obama a 'completely crooked lowlife' after news reports claimed the White House had leaked Israel's plan for military attacks against Iran just weeks before last year's election. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later said that those attacks were called off at the Obama administration's request. 'A guy like this should be locked up,' Mason said Sunday. 'If he wasn’t the president, he’d be in jail or in a sanitarium. He wouldn’t be outside talking to people in this condition. He would be considered a danger to his own his own health, to his own life.'","Aging conservative comic says the president 'should be locked up'

"Like many social media evangelists, Twitter founder Jack Dorsey uses a variety of digital platforms to document his life but one of his latest posts might get him into trouble. Last Thursday morning as Dorsey’s commercial flight was taking off from San Francisco he tweeted a link to a short clip of his flight leaving the ground. To film such a video Dorsey would have had to use his cellphone, thereby disobeying Federal Aviation Administration instructions which prohibit the use of electronic devices during take-off and landings. Like many social media evangelists, Twitter founder Jack Dorsey uses a variety of digital platforms to document his life . Dorsey, now CEO of mobile payments company Square, has not replied to requests for comment about his actions, but according to CNN Money passengers might not need to comply with that particular request for much longer. The FAA claims that using electrical devices during take-off poses a safety issue and that radio signals emitted from electronic devices can interfere with an aircraft's communications. However this doesn’t prevent as many as 69 percent of adult passengers reportedly using their portable devices during flights, according to a recent study by the Airline Passenger Experience Association and the Consumer Electronics Association. Almost one-third of passengers say they have accidentally left their device on, found the same survey. Last Thursday morning as Dorsey's commercial flight was taking off from San Francisco he tweeted a link to a short video clip of his flight leaving the ground . As a result of such large numbers of passengers failing to comply with the request to switch electrical devices off, the FAA is currently looking into what kind of devices it might be OK for passengers to use on board in those situations. A draft of the committee's report recommends the FAA should relax its ban on e-readers and MP3 players, but not cell phones, reports The Wall Street Journal. 'As the consumer electronics industry has exploded,' the report says, the FAA's traditional stance of giving individual airlines leeway to evaluate the safety of specific devices before allowing them to remain on at low altitude 'has become untenable.' The FAA likely won't make a formal decision on the matter until after it receives the final version of the advisory panel's study, now delayed til end of September.","Jack Dorsey tweeted a link to a Vine clip of his flight taking off .

"Punishment: Florida mom Melissa Neale was arrested Thursday on charges that she used a stun gun to discipline her daughter . A mother in Orange County, Florida was arrested and charged with aggravated child abuse Thursday, after using a stun gun on her daughter. 34-year-old Melissa Neale had been staying with her two children at a friend's home in Orlando. Neale and her children had recently relocated from Texas. It was the female friend she was staying with that reported the crime. On June 9, Neale brandished a stun gun and used it on her daughter when the girl apparently didn't make oatmeal to her liking. The witness said that Neale started yelling at the child, then grabbed the stun gun from her bedroom, cornered the girl and tasered her left kneecap. It seemed evident that the stun gun was activated since the child screamed and fell to the floor. Neale's friend didn't want to get involved at first. But when she came across a note in the child's dresser expressing how the girl no longer wanted to live, the friend decided to contact police. Neale on the other hand, denies that the stun gun was on. She told investigators that everyone was playing with the taser, and when she touched her child with it, it was not turned on. She explains the bruising on her daughter's knee came from a paddling with a spoon and not the stun gun. The wrong way: Neale allegedly used the stun gun on her daughter for not making oatmeal the right way . Arrested: Neale was arrested on Thursday, and her stun gun confiscated. She made bail late Friday evening, but her children are now being cared for by other relatives . This wasn't the only incident Neale's friend witnessed of child abuse. In the affidavit, the witness describes the way Melissa disciplines her children. 'When Melissa disciplines (the child) she will slap (the child) in the face, punch (the child) in the back of the head or will grab (the child) by the hair and pull (the child) around the room,' she said. Neale was arrested on Thursday at the Orlando Health and Rehabilitation Center, where she works. She was released on $2,500 bail late Friday evening. Her children are now in the care of the Department of Children, which has placed them with relatives.","Melissa Neale, 34, tased her daughter for making oatmeal the wrong way .

"Rare home movie footage of Douglas Bader, the inspirational Second World War pilot who battled Nazi Germany even after losing his legs, is to go on show to the public for the first time. Bader, Britain’s best-known fighter ace, lost his legs in a pre-war flying accident and was invalided out of the Royal Air Force. When war broke out he persuaded medical officers to let him rejoin and was soon taking to the skies in Spitfire and Hurricane fighters as the RAF defended Britain from Germany’s Luftwaffe in the summer of 1940. Scroll down for video . In newly released film, Douglas Bader appears relaxed as he takes part in a treasure hunt with other officers and their wives . In another clip, Bader emerges from an officers' mess smoking a pipe and salutes to the camera . Fighter: Douglas Bader, the pilot who fought with the RAF despite having prosthetic legs. Rare footage of him has gone on display at an exhibition . A new exhibition at the Imperial War . Museum’s Duxford site, near Cambridge, will show an amateur black and . white film shot by his RAF colleague, Group Captain George ‘Sammy’ Sampson, who served as a pilot and instructor at Duxford between 1931 . and 1933. In the film a relaxed Bader is shown participating in a treasure hunt with other officers and their wives. In . another sequence he is shown walking out of Duxford’s officers’ mess in . civilian clothes and giving a jaunty salute to the camera. A hero to most of his men, Bader flew with 222 Squadron ahead of the Dunkirk evacuation . The . images are a far cry from the better known pictures of the rambunctious . Bader, who would later retire from the RAF as a Group Captain and shot . down 20 enemy aircraft during the war. He . achieved national celebrity after the publication of Paul Brickhill’s . book Reach For The Sky, which was turned into a 1956 feature film . starring Kenneth More as Bader. Bader, . who died aged 72 in 1982, lost his legs in 1931 and left the air force . at Duxford having been told he would never fly again. But . he returned in 1940 to fly Spitfires with 19 Squadron. He said: ‘The . fact that I left the Royal Air Force at Duxford and I came back into it . at Duxford, through the same bloody gate, is what comes to mind.’ A . hero to most of his men, Bader flew with 222 Squadron ahead of the . Dunkirk evacuation. He was then sent to command 242 Squadron, a . Hurricane unit that had suffered heavy casualties in the Battle of . France. Bader rapidly won his jaded aircrew over with a display of daring aerobatics at their base at RAF Coltishall near Norwich. The . squadron was soon back in the thick of the Battle of Britain and was . regularly posted to Duxford to join up with other fighters. Here Baden is photographed at North Weald Airfield getting into a spitfire ready to lead a flight over London commemorating the fifth anniversary of the Battle of Britain .

By the date this photograph was taken they had, between them, shot down more than 30 enemy aircraft . Often . described as determined and dogmatic or fearless and eager for a . challenge, Bader produced mixed reactions among his RAF peers. Flight Sergeant George Unwin – who . was nicknamed ‘Grumpy’ by Bader after he rebuked the legless pilot for . making too much noise taking his artificial limbs off – described his . former colleague on 19 Squadron as ‘outstanding’. ‘He inspired you,’ Unwin said, ‘he was not just two tin legs.’ But . the comments of another former Duxford pilot shed some light on Bader’s . sometimes controversial personality. ‘He was not everybody’s cup of . tea,’ said Gordon Sinclair.

While . leaping from his aircraft Bader lost one of his artificial legs. After . his Germans captors gave special permission, pledging they would not . shoot down a delivery aircraft, a replacement was dropped from the air. Bader promptly tried to escape. Steve Woolford, head of . interpretations and collections at Imperial War Museum Duxford, said . Bader was an ‘incredible character as a man’. ‘His story still grips people today. Opinions about him range from heroic individual to a difficult man,’ he added. ‘As a combat leader he was a controversial figure within the RAF both as a personality and in terms of his ideas about air fighting.’ Bader was a proponent of the ‘Big Wing’, a huge formation of aircraft involving several squadrons of fighters which he believe should be sent aloft en masse from 12 Group aerodromes north of London to shoot down enemy bombers with a knockout blow. This was at odds with the tactics employed by the rival 11 Group, led by Sir Keith Park, and which covered south east England and was the immediate line of defence against aerial attackers. The debate over the Big Wing tactics persists to this day. He was knighted in 1976 for his work with disabled people through The Douglas Bader Foundation.

"Last man standing: Ewald-Heinrich von Kleist, pictured in 2010, the last surviving member of the main plot to kill Adolf Hitler, has died aged 90 . The last surviving member of the famous briefcase bomb plot to assassinate Hitler has died aged 90. Ewald-Heinrich von Kleist took part in the July 20 conspiracy to kill Adolf Hitler, a failed attempt on the Nazi dictator’s life in 1944. Von Kleist, who once volunteered to act as a suicide bomber to kill Hitler, died at his home in Munich on Friday. He became a member of the July 20 conspiracy, also known as Operation Valkyrie, after he was approached by Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, the man who eventually planted the bomb in Hitler’s conference room at Wolf’s Lair. The assassination attempt was brought to the big screen in the 2008 film ‘Valkyrie’ starring Tom Cruise as von Stauffenberg. Von Kleist was born into an aristocratic family in Pommerania, an area of northeastern Germany which today is part of Poland. The von Kleist family had a long history of serving in high-ranking military and administrative positions for the German government. His father, Ewald von Kleist, was an early opponent of Hitler who famously travelled to England in 1938 in a failed attempt to persuade the British government to support a coup against Hitler. Despite his family's opposition to the Nazis, von Kleist joined the German army in 1940. He was wounded fighting on the Eastern Front in 1943 and during his convalescence came in contact with von Stauffenberg. A fellow officer from an aristocratic family, von Stauffenberg presented him with a plan to kill Hitler. Von Kleist had been chosen as the officer to model a new uniform for Hitler, and von Stauffenberg proposed that he wear a suicide vest underneath, which he would detonate standing next to the dictator. Years later von Kleist remembered . explaining the suicide plot to his father, who paused only briefly . before telling his 22-year-old son: ‘Yes, you have to do this.’ ‘Fathers . love their sons and mine certainly did, and I had been quite sure he . would say no,’ von Kleist recalled. ‘But, as always, I had . underestimated him.’ Survivor: Von Kleist, pictured left during his time in the army, and in 1997, right, was approached by Claus von Stauffenberg to wear a bomb vest to be detonated near Hitler - a plan which failed - before the July 20 plot . Plot to kill: Count Colonel Claus Von Stauffenberg, left, looks on as Adolf Hitler arrives at Wolf's Lair on July 15, 1944, five days before Operation Valkyrie was carried out . Coup d'etat: The picture shows Hitler's conference room at Wolf's Lair after the failed attempt on his life on July 20, 1944 . However, the suicide attack was never materialised as Hitler kept postponing the uniform demonstration. A few months later von Kleist was approached again. Von Stauffenberg asked him to take part in the July 20 plot and carry a briefcase packed with explosives to a meeting with Hitler, a job which ended up falling on von Stauffenberg himself. The colonel placed the bomb in a conference room at Hitler’s East Prussian headquarters, known as Wolf’s Lair, where he was meeting with his aides and military advisers. The plan failed after someone moved the briefcase with the explosives next to a table leg and Hitler escaped with his life. Failed attack: The Nazi dictator survived the 1944 explosion as one of his aides moved the briefcase with the explosives and a nearby table protected him . On screen: Tom Cruise portrays Claus von Stauffenberg in Valkyrie, the 2008 film about the July 20 bomb plot . Von Kleist remained in Berlin, charged with overseeing the arrest of officers and officials loyal to Hitler in the city. But when news spread that Hitler had survived, the plot crumbled and von Stauffenberg, von Kleist's father, and scores of others were arrested and executed. Von Kleist himself was arrested and questioned at length by the Gestapo, and sent to a concentration camp, but then inexplicably let go and returned to combat duty. He was posted at the front for the duration of World War II and went on to set up his own publishing house Ewald-von-Kleist-Verlag. He also founded the Munich Conference on Security Policy, an annual conference on international security policy in 1962, which he moderated it 1998.","Ewald-Heinrich von Kleist took part in the famous July 20 plot to kill Hitler .

"This is the hilarious moment a tourist was photobombed by a deer as she tried to snap a keepsake photo of one of the Scottish Highlands’ iconic mountains. Alison Neilly, 43, wound up getting an unforgettable shot thanks to the curious animal’s interest in her camera. The amusing encounter occurred when Alison, from Kinlochleven, stopped to capture the scene as mist descended on the 3,350ft Buachaille Etive Mor at Glencoe. Oh deer! The friendly hind pokes her head into Alison Neilly's photograph of Buachaille Etive Mor . Say cheese: The deer licks its lips while Alison Neilly attempts to snap a keepsake photo of the iconic peak . But just as Alison snapped what should have been a magnificent picture the friendly deer poked her head into the shot, licking her lips for good measure. Alison said: ‘When I was crouching down to get the pictures it just put its head in the way.’ The snack bar worker uploaded the pictures to an online profile, with the caption: ‘Buachaille Etive Mor and a cheeky young hind who wanted in on the shot too’. The images have proved a big hit with animal lovers.

"Britain's first DIY male fertility test appears in shops this weekend enabling men – and women – to do sperm count checks at home. Experts hope the £30 kits will help more people recognise that male infertility is a major reason why many couples have trouble conceiving naturally. But sex therapists believe they could also cause serious friction in a relationship – with girlfriends and wives even secretly testing their men to see if they are potent or not. Designed to look like a pregnancy test, the SpermCheck takes ten minutes to show if a man has a ‘normal’ or ‘low’ sperm count. The kit is 98 per cent accurate at determining if a man has 20 million sperm or more per millilitre (the World Health Organisation benchmark), which nine in ten men do. That is as good as a lab test, according to its makers. But specialists point out there is nothing in the test to check how healthy the sperm are. Having a sperm count lower than 20 million/ml does not mean a man cannot have children naturally but it does mean he is likely to be sub-fertile, affecting his chances of doing so. The makers of the test recommend that men who find they have a low sperm count consult their doctors. SpermCheck chief executive Ray Lopez said: ‘With this test we  can truly help couples suffering from infertility. ‘A lot of the time, the woman is the one who is burdened with finding out what is wrong, but the reality of the situation is that in 40 to 60 per cent of cases, male factor infertility is to blame.’ Sex therapist Michelle Bassam welcomed Boots’ decision to stock the US-designed kits, which will be placed next to pregnancy and ovulation tests. But she also wondered how many men would actually buy them. She said: ‘I personally think that it will be more the woman who goes out to buy it than the man.’ She warned a woman could easily provoke a row simply by coming home with a kit and suggesting her man test himself. ‘It could certainly cause friction in a relationship,’ she said. ‘Male infertility is still a taboo subject. Once a man finds out he is infertile, he feels emasculated.’ And she added: ‘A woman could also secretly perform the test. ‘If she is considering having a child with a man once she is married, she could use it to test him out beforehand.’ The test: It works by looking for a protein called SP-10 which is present only on the heads of mature sperm, and semen can be tested up to three hours after collection . That raises the possibility of women dumping their men on the basis of a ten-minute test. A low sperm count result could also prompt men to sleep around  to prove their masculinity, Ms  Bassam said. However, Ms Bassam of Harley Therapy in London, agreed that the easy availability of the test would help dispel the ‘stigma’ of male infertility. The test works by looking for a protein called SP-10 which is present only on the heads of mature sperm, and semen can be tested up to three hours after collection. Results might not even be seriously affected if the semen is collected from a condom, which contains sperm-killing chemicals. Alison Campbell, head of embryology at Care Fertility, one of Britain’s biggest IVF clinics, said one of the flaws was that the test would still count dead sperm. So a man could have a normal sperm count but would never father a baby if they were all defective. ‘There’s some possibility of that, where a woman says, “This is my perfect mate, but I better find out if he is fertile or not,” - SpermCheck chief executive Ray Lopez . Sperm needed to be able to move and have the right shape to fertilise an egg, she explained, and this was something which could only be confirmed by a full semen analysis. ‘There’s no alternative to seeing a professional,’ she said. The test was very crude, she added, as it gave no indication of whether a man’s sperm count was close to 20 million per millilitre or zero. Mr Lopez admitted women could use the test to check if their partners really were mating material. ‘There’s some possibility of that, where a woman says, “This is my perfect mate, but I better find out if he is fertile or not,” he said. ‘But if you’ve got a man who has a low sperm count, that doesn’t mean he can’t father a child.’ Men can raise their sperm count by eating a healthy diet, exercising, losing weight, avoiding hot baths and swapping tight underwear for looser boxer shorts, say experts. For those with more serious fertility problems, a range of solutions exist, including artificial insemination, which costs about £1,000, and IVF, where healthy sperm are  collected and put in a dish to  fertilise an egg. Each cycle costs about £4,000. And for men with blocked tubes, doctors can even ‘fish’ sperm directly out of their testes. Will men bother with a fertility test? I doubt they care enough. I doubt they will bother to go into a Boots, because men never go into Boots unless forced upon point of death. They would look at the  price tag and exclaim that £30 is far too expensive. It’s not that  they never doubt whether or not they can father a child, but that they prefer to leave it to chance. Unlike women. I imagine it is wannabe mums, hovering around 40, who will buy this damn thing, and use it as yet another cosh to hit men with. As well as selecting a suitable mate by examining his bank account, teeth, inside of his car (I have a friend who dumped a man for having sweet wrappers in the foot-well), CV, wardrobe, and his parents, women will now be able to count not only his pairs of socks that match, but his sperm. - Liz Jones . I imagine women will do this surreptitiously by stealing his sperm post-coital because most men, faced with a gimlet-eyed fortysomething female brandishing this little device, will react like a vampire approached with a cross, or daylight. There are no guarantees in life. If you can both make another human being, you are blessed and lucky. Why tinker with serendipity? If you are having trouble conceiving, and are desperate, you should both decide to consult an expert. This sort of DIY weeding out of weedy men is a new way to emasculate them, along with making them wee sitting down, brushing their tongues and ironing their hankies. My advice? Buy him a pair of baggy Calvin Klein boxer shorts, pretend to understand everything that comes out of Gary Lineker’s mouth, and leave it to fate. Apparently – and this fact made me laugh out loud – telling your partner he has a low sperm count will encourage him to sleep around: you have to hand it to the unreconstructed dears for their optimism. Women, of course, finding out their man cannot act as a stud for a future dreadful brood will become hysterical and accusing. No one wins from the above scenario. Let sleeping dogs lie. Don’t use his snoring as your cue to steal his sperm and weigh up your options.","£30 kits can test a man's sperm count in ten minutes .

"Coal will become more in demand than oil by 2020 driven by growth in China and India, despite campaigns to reduce carbon emissions across the globe, a new report reveals. Marking a return to an era reminiscent of Britain's industrial revolution, the rapidly expanding economies in the East are turning to coal since it is cheaper and more reliable than oil or renewable energy sources, energy consultancy firm Wood Mackenzie said on Monday. Rising demand in China and India will push coal past oil as the two Asian powerhouses will need to rely on the comparatively cheaper fuel to power their economies. Coal demand in the United States, Europe and the rest of Asia will hold steady. Smog: China has access to vast swathes of coal, which is cheaper for it to use than other fossil fuels. Pictured, Wuda Coal Field, in Wu Hai, Inner Mongolia, China, where coal is mined, then trucked nearby to the power stations and factories in the region . Little choice: China has no alternative to coal, with its domestic gas output limited, and liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports more costly than coal . Global coal consumption is expected to rise by 25 per cent by the end of the decade to 4,500 million tonnes of oil equivalent, overtaking oil at 4,400 million tonnes, according to Woodmac in a presentation on Monday at the World Energy Congress. 'China's demand for coal will almost single-handedly propel the growth of coal as the dominant global fuel,' said William Durbin, president of global markets at Woodmac. 'Unlike alternatives, it is plentiful and affordable.' China - already the top consumer - will drive two-thirds of the growth in global coal use this decade. Half of China's power generation capacity to be built between 2012 and 2020 will be coal-fired, said Woodmac. China has no alternative to coal, with its domestic gas output limited, and liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports more costly than coal, Durbin said. China's demand for coal will almost single handedly propel it to the most demanded fuel on the planet, the report says . 'Renewables cannot provide base load power. This leaves coal as the primary energy source,' he said. Power infrastructure provider Alstom estimated that across Asia close to half of the 600 gigawatt of new power generators to be built over the next five years will be coal-fired, Giles Dickson, a vice president at the company said. 'Coal prices are low,' he said, adding that coal is about one-third of the price of LNG in Asia and about half of the gas price in Europe. Abundant supply is also supporting demand for coal. The traded volumes of coal will increase by a further 20 per cent by 2020, Dickson said, including supply of lower grade coal from Indonesia, Australia and South Africa. 'As the lower grade coal comes into the market, further downward pressure on prices will further drive demand,' he said. Currently, oil is the most used fuel the world over, but coal is expected to be more in demand by 2020 . Excess supply and faltering demand growth have depressed global coal prices this year. European coal futures have tumbled more than 20 per cent, while Australian coal prices have plummeted from the record $130 per tonne hit in 2011 to around $80 per tonne as China's demand grew slower than expected. 'If you take China and India out of the equation, what is more surprising is that under current regulations, coal demand in the rest of the world will remain at current levels,' Durbin said. High fuel import costs and nuclear issues will support coal use throughout Northeast Asia, while in North America coal is still competitive in many locations despite abundant low-cost shale gas. 'The struggling economy and low coal prices has rendered the European Union (EU) Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) ineffective,' Durbin said. 'The carbon price will need to reach 40 euros per tonne to encourage fuel switching, which is unlikely before 2020.' In Southeast Asia, coal will be the biggest winner in the region's energy mix. Coal will generate nearly half of Southeast Asia's electricity by 2035, up from less than a third now, the International Energy Agency said in early October. This will contribute to a doubling of the region's energy-related carbon dioxide emissions to 2.3 gigatonnes by 2035, according to the IEA.","Economic growth in China and India are driving global demand for coal .

"An Afghan man has confessed to shooting dead two American soldiers who were training him as a police officer in an attack which took place three years ago. In a chilling and candid account, the unidentified man said he had waited until Sergeant . Aaron Smith and Private First Class Brandon Owens had taken off their body armour before calmly gunning them down in Wardak Province, central Afghanistan. His confession . comes just a day after four American soldiers were gunned down by Afghan . police at a checkpoint in a similar incident. The latest in a spate of so-called green-on-blue attacks. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Confession: This unidentified man said that while he was being trained as a member of the Afghan Local Police in October 2009, he killed two American soldiers during an insider attack . Proof: The man was wearing his blue Afghan police uniform (pictured) when he carried out the attack and he was picked up by the Taliban shortly after, who helped him hide out in Pakistan for the following three years . Shot dead: The unidentified Afghan man who spoke to CNN admitted . that he killed Aaron Smith (left) and Brandon Owens (right) on October . 2, 2009 . Two British troops were also killed at a checkpoint at a different base in the south of the country on Sunday. Speaking from inside a Taliban . controlled village the man said: 'The Americans went inside . the nearby school for a break. While the number of soldiers being killed or injured by roadside bombs is falling there have been a growing number of incidents involving Afghan police or soldiers opening fire on coalition troops. So far this year at least 51 servicemen have been killed in so-called 'green on blue' attacks compared to a total of 35 last year. While the Taliban are often quick to . claim responsibility for the killings, intelligence sources believe most . are actually carried out by 'lone-wolves' who have personal grievances against . foreign troops. U.S. Col Todd Collins said: 'The Taliban lie and we know they lie we think they overstate their influence on their tragic incidents. 'We think somewhere around 25 per cent are insurgent related to some degree.' The attacks are referred to as . green-on-blue due to the colour of the coalition uniforms used by . American and British troops and the blue outfits worn by the Afghan . Local Police force. Chief spokesman for NATO's International Security Assistance Force, Brig-Gen Gunter Katz said: 'What we identified was that most of them were caused by personal grievances and stress situations. 'Those isolated incidents don't reflect the overall security situation in Afghanistan. 'As we speak 500,000 soldiers and policemen are working together to contribute to a more secure and stable Afghanistan.' 'They took off their body armour and . put their weapons down. At that moment, I thought it was the right time . so I took my gun and shot them.' Admitting to the 2009 incident that left the two soldiers dead and three others injured, the man told CNN that he did so because he took issue with the way that Americans were treating his people. He . said that he decided to kill the two men on October 2 'because . Americans were oppressing people in my country. They were burning copies . of the holy Koran and disrespecting it'. Shortly after the attack, the . unidentified Afghan man, who is a father of two, says that he was . captured by the Taliban. After he told his captors that he had killed . Americans, the Taliban took him to Pakistan where he was 'welcomed very . warmly like a hero'. The man is now back in Afghanistan after his Taliban captors decided that it was safe enough for him to return. 'They . said Americans were not everywhere like they used to be. The Taliban . had brought security and I should return home,' he said. So far in 2012, NATO reported that there had . already been 51 coalition deaths because of so-called green-on-blue . attacks, and as a result the Afghan Local Police training scheme would . be paused temporarily while the admission criteria were re-evaluated to . weed out possible attackers. The unidentified Afghan solider seems confident that the attacks will continue because the hatred is still there. 'I know they will increase, I know more people will do what I did,' he said. Those words are even more provocative in the wake of this weekend's killings. Four American soldiers were killed on Sunday in Kabul, and their identities have not been released. Married father-of-two Sergeant Gareth . Thursby, 29, and Private Thomas Wroe, 18, were shot dead in the south of . Nahr-e Saraj district, Helmand province, on Saturday. Tributes: Married father-of-two Sergeant Gareth . Thursby, 29, and Private Thomas Wroe, 18, were shot dead in the south of . Nahr-e Saraj district, Helmand province, yesterday . The . men were killed at a checkpoint when a man dressed as a local Afghan . policeman pretended to be injured so they would help him, defence . sources said. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said: . 'I was saddened to hear of this cowardly act by a man wearing an Afghan . local police uniform, which has taken the lives of two brave British . soldiers. 'All of our . thoughts are with the families of Sergeant Gareth Thursby and Private . Thomas Wroe. They gave their lives protecting Britain's national . security, helping to make sure that Afghanistan never again becomes a . haven for international terrorism.' Sgt Thursby, who had completed tours of duty in Kosovo and Iraq, was nicknamed Bull because of his strength and confidence. His . commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Zachary Stenning, said: 'He was . admired and deeply respected by his soldiers and peers for his . soldiering skills, physical strength and forthright honesty. Utterly . professional, his standards were legendary.' Horror: Two British soldiers were gunned down by a man in an Afghan police uniform (file photo) Guard: Earlier this week, two Marines were killed and several more wounded at Camp Bastion in Afghanistan . He . added: 'I heard just a few weeks ago that he had told his platoon to . call him Dad during the tour. That is how he saw himself; a father . figure for 30 men and women involved in gruelling operations in . Helmand.' Third fatality: Lance Corporal Duane Groom, 32, from 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards, died on Friday after his vehicle hit a roadside bomb . Private Wroe, who joined the Army in September 2010, was praised for his professional skills and positive attitude. His . company commander, Major Finlay Bibby, said: 'His confidence, sense of . humour and ever present smile made him hugely popular and fun to be . with.' The MoD said . the deaths were unrelated to the attack at Camp Bastion which killed . two US Marines. Those attackers had automatic rifles, . rocket-propelled grenade launchers and suicide vests. Besides destroying . six Harrier jets, they demolished three refuelling stations and damaged six . aircraft hangars. The Taliban claimed responsibility for . that attack, saying it wanted to avenge Muslims insulted by an . amateurish film that mocked the Prophet Muhammad - and because Prince . Harry is on the base. The Prince, who turned 28 on Saturday, . is set to start flying Apache missions this week, and his deployment is . not planned to be shortened after the attack. This is his second tour . in Afghanistan. The latest deaths bring the number of . members of UK forces to have died since operations began in Afghanistan . in October 2001 to 430. They came during a bloody few days in the . war-torn country.

"Lengthy applause is seen as the ultimate mark of approval on a performance. But rather than showing we like what we see, researchers believe the length of time we clap is closely linked to peer pressure. Once one person starts clapping it spreads like an ‘infection’ spreading from one person to another - with the crowd ‘instinctively’ responding to the noise. Applause: Once one person starts clapping it spreads like an 'infection' spreading from one person to another - with the crowd 'instinctively' responding to the noise, researchers say (file picture) Crowds continue to clap following a performance until someone is brave, tired or bored enough to stop and the volume of applause starts dropping, according to researchers. Lead researcher Dr Richard Mann, from Uppsala University in Sweden, said: ‘Once someone has started clapping, it only takes a couple of seconds for the rest of the crowd to follow. Most people aren’t making a conscious decision about whether they should applaud. ‘As individuals, we don’t want to be the only ones clapping, nor do we want to clap alone. It is a very instinctive form of peer pressure, it is incredibly powerful.’ But once the first one or two people stop clapping, the rest of the audience shortly follows. However, until this occurs, the group will keep on applauding. ‘You can get very different lengths of applause from identical talks, with rounds of applause that were two to three times longer,’ said Dr Mann. ‘We found boredom or tiredness is the main trigger for an individual to stop clapping, and once this happens, the rest of the crowd soon follow.’ He said the findings suggest the length of applause is not a safe way to gauge the quality of a performance. Findings: Crowds continue to clap following a performance until someone is brave, tired or bored enough to stop, according to the lead researcher from Uppsala University (pictured) in Sweden . ‘You should be wary of encores - often . people just keep on clapping as long as everyone else is,’ said Dr Mann. ‘On the plus side, performers can take comfort from this if they get a . short round of applause.’ The research, which is published in the . Journal of the Royal Society Interface, involved 107 students. They were . split into six different groups and asked to listen to two . presentations each. Although the length of applause varied from group to group, the average time it took for the whole group to start clapping after the first individual had begun was under three seconds. 'We found boredom or tiredness is the main trigger for an individual to stop clapping, and once this happens, the rest of the crowd soon follow' Dr Richard Mann of Uppsala University . It also took the crowd less than three seconds to cease clapping after the first person stopped. Dr Mann said that once 5 to 15 per cent of the group ended their applause, the rest were likely to follow. The study concluded: ‘Variation in the length of applause can arise even for talks which are equally appreciated by the audience. ‘Randomness in the audience interactions can sometimes result in unusually strong or weak levels of appreciation, independent of the quality of the presentation. ‘Groups must coordinate the cessation of clapping and on different occasions this can take longer or shorter periods of time to achieve. 'The social problem an audience must solve after an academic presentation is not how and when to start a round of applause, but it is rather how to coordinate its end.’","Crowd 'instinctively' responds to the noise of one person applauding .

"These dramatic images show the moment a man with 'cop-killer' tattooed across his knuckles, wanted for shooting four officers, was killed after a 16-mile police chase. Christopher Chase, was found dead, slumped over the wheel of a stolen police car after being shot eight times - three times in the neck, once in the back of his head, scalp and upper back, twice in his left arm. Chase was pursued for 16 miles through the streets of Albuquerque, New Mexico, by dozens of police officers, before crashing the stolen car into a petrol pump. Warning graphic content, Scroll down for video . Police were embroiled in a 16-mile chase through Albuquerque after Christopher Chase opened fire at officers, injuring four, before stealing a police car and trying to escape . Dressed in body armour and camouflage and carrying an assault rifle described by an officer as being an AK47, Live Leak reported, the 35-year-old told witnesses to call police, and let them know he was waiting for them. The video was shot from cameras mounted on the lapels of the officers involved. It begins with Bernalilo County Sheriff's deputy Robin Hopkins telling her colleagues she is being shot at. A male officer is seen being treated for a leg wound, by a colleague, his police car having been stolen by Chase. Deputy Hopkins is then found slumped, . injured in her car as colleagues are heard shouting 'She's been shot, . she's been shot', in the background. As the 16-mile pursuit progresses, an officer is heard to say, 'If someone has a clear shot to take the vehicle out'. The . next shot shows an officers apparently firing through the windscreen of . his car with one hand, while steering with the other. The dramatic footage was shot on cameras mounted on the lapels of the police officers involved . One officer is seen shooting his machine gun through the windscreen of his car with one hand, while steering with the other . One officer is seen trying to treat a gunshot wound to his leg. A colleague is seen helping him stem the bleeding, as the injured officer ties a tourniquet around his thigh . The injured officer appears calm, watching as he is treated for the wound . Officers are then embroiled in a gun battle at a petrol station, with several police cars on the forecourt, officers shielding behind the open doors. After crashing the police car into a petrol pump, Chase was found slumped over the wheel of the stolen police car, blood splattered across the windscreen and inside of the vehicle. He was wanted for shooting four officers, on October 26. Three received minor injuries, while the fourth suffered a shattered thigh bone. Documents released by the Office of the Medical Investigator show Chase was shot eight times in total. The . report showed he had three gunshot wounds on his neck near his sternum . and another from a bullet that entered near the back of his head. Another officer is seen on the floor having suffered an injury during the shoot out. Four officers in total were shot - three suffered minor injuries, while the fourth suffered a shattered thigh bone . At one point officers are heard shouting: 'She's been shot, she's been shot' A female officer is seen in the full version of the video, slumped injured in her car . Officers followed Chase through the streets of the New Mexico city. Several police cars eventually surrounded the 35-year-old at a petrol station . An autopsy report revealed Chase suffered eight gunshot wounds to the neck, head and back. He was found slumped over the wheel of the blood-stained police car . Chase also had a gunshot wound on his scalp, a 'gaping' laceration that measured six inches by four inches at its widest point. The 27-page autopsy report said Chase's brain was 'extensively lacerated' from at least two of the shots, adding it was impossible to track the trajectories of the bullets. He was found to have suffered blunt injuries to his head and upper left arm as well. APD spokeswoman Tasia Martinez said the shooting is still under investigation, and the department is waiting on the results of ballistics tests to determine how many officers fired and who they were. 'We do not know how many officers fired their weapons yet,' Martinez said. She said six officers were placed on leave after the shooting, which is standard practise for officers involved in shootings.","Dramatic footage shot from cameras mounted on officers' lapels .

"Suzanne Basso held back tears and smiled at her friends as she became the fourteenth woman to be executed in America since the resumption of capital punishment. The 59-year-old woman was found guilty in 1999 of leading a group of thugs to viciously torture and murder Louis 'Buddy' Musso, a mentally disabled man she convinced to move with her to Texas with the promise of marriage. Executions of women are uncommon in the U.S. and only five women in Texas have been put to death since the Supreme Court resumed capital punishment in 1976. Scroll down for video . Justice for Buddy: Suzanne Basso (left), 59,  was put to death Wednesday night in relation to the 1998 torture slaying of Louis 'Buddy' Musso (right), a 59-year-old mentally impaired man with the intellect of a 7-year-old, near Houston . Texas, which executes the most death . row convicts out of any state, has stopped giving last meal requests so . Basso had the same dinner as all the other inmates: baked chicken, fish, . boiled eggs, carrots, green beans, and sliced bread. Basso was led into the execution room around 2:15pm, wearing her white prison uniform. When asked by the warden if she had any last words, Basso said: 'No sir'. She . seemed to be holding back tears when she smiled at two friends watching . through the window. She mouthed a word to them and nodded before being . injected with the lethal drug pentobarbital. After the lethal injection. Basso began to snore, though the snoring became less audible and eventually stopped. She was officially pronounced dead at 6:26pm, 11 minutes after the drug was administered. Shocking crime: Basso was convicted in 1999 of leading a group of thugs in cutting and bashing Musso before dumping his body in a ditch so they could cash his life insurance policy . Leading . up to the execution, Basso's lawyer argued that the 59-year-old woman . was not mentally competent enough to face the death penalty because she . suffers from delusions, and that the state statute governing competency . was unconstitutionally flawed. He also challenged the legality of a . medical examiner's testimony. A state judge last month ruled that Basso had a history of fabricating stories about herself, sought attention and manipulated psychological tests. ‘She would pretend to be different things,’ recalled Colleen Barnett, who prosecuted Basso. ‘One setting she would pretend to be blind. One setting she would pretend she couldn't walk. One setting she had the voice of a little girl. Honey trap: Police say Basso met Musso during a church carnival in New Jersey and lured him to Texas after promising to marry him . One mental health expert indicated additional testing over an extended period of time ‘would provide a more reliable evaluation,’ attorney Winston Cochran said in a federal court filing. ‘Why rush to judgment on Basso?’ he asked, seeking a punishment delay that was refused Monday by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals and a federal judge. He took his appeals Tuesday to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, one step short of the Supreme Court. At the competency hearing, a haggard-looking Basso sporting a cropped haircut testified from a hospital bed wheeled into a Houston courtroom and talked about a snake smuggled into a prison hospital in an attempt to kill her. Cochran said a degenerative disease . has left her paralyzed. Basso, 59, contended her paralysis was the . result of a jail beating years ago. At . the hearing, she acknowledged representations about her background — . that she was a triplet, worked in the New York governor's office, had a . relationship with Nelson Rockefeller — were untrue. She originally was . from the Albany and Schenectady areas of New York. At her trial, Basso was portrayed as the ringleader of a group of people who fatally tortured Musso in 1998 to steal his money. Musso, . who had the intellect of a 7-year-old child but cared for himself, had . met either Basso or her son at a church carnival in New Jersey. He left . there to move in with her in Jacinto City, just east of Houston. ‘She lured him to Texas with the idea they'd get married,’ Barnett said. Evidence . showed that she already was married, made herself the beneficiary of . insurance policies purchased for Musso and took over his Social Security . benefits. Five others, . including Basso's son, also were convicted for Musso's death but . prosecutors sought the death penalty only for Basso. Web of lies: Basso had pretended to be blind or paralyzed, said she was a triplet, worked in the New York governor's office, and had a relationship with Nelson Rockefeller . Court documents detailed extensive abuse Musso endured days before his body was found in a ditch by a jogger. He'd . been bathed in a solution of bleach and pine cleaner and scrubbed with a . wire brush. An autopsy showed he had at least 17 cuts to his head; 28 . cuts and cigarette burns on his back; bruises all over his body; a skull . fracture; a fractured bone in his neck; 14 broken ribs and two . dislocated vertebrae. ‘It . was just horrible, horrible, horrible,’ Barnett said. ‘When you talk . about the death penalty, what the death penalty was made for, it was for . a case like this.’ Basso told police in a written statement that she drove Musso's body to the dump site. She became a suspect after reporting Musso missing in an apparent attempt to distance herself from his slaying once his body was discovered. None of the eight other women on Texas death row has an execution date.","Suzanne Basso, 59, was convicted in 1999 of being ringleader of a group of people who tortured and murdered Louis 'Buddy' Musso .

"This is the face belonging to an ancient skeleton buried in Roman times, created using the latest 3D reconstruction technology. The so-called 'Beachy Head Lady' - because she was discovered in the East Sussex beauty spot - had her face recreated using craniofacial reconstruction techniques. Her skeleton was first discovered in Beachy Head 1953, and she is thought to have lived around 245 AD- the middle of the Roman period in Britain. Unusually Beachy Head Lady is from sub-Saharan Africa which was outside of the Roman Empire. This is the face of an ancient skeleton buried in Roman times, created using 3D reconstruction techniques . Experts are not entirely sure how she ended up in Britain, but researchers believe Beachy Head Lady probably grew up in the area and was possibly the wife or mistress of a local official at a nearby Roman villa. Another theory is that she was a merchant trading wares in Europe and chose to settle in the country. Jo Seaman, heritage officer at Eastbourne Borough Council, said: ‘This is a fantastic discovery for the south coast. ‘We know this lady was around 30 years old, grew up in the vicinity of what is now East Sussex, ate a good diet of fish and vegetables, her bones were without disease and her teeth were in good condition. Researchers used the size of the skull and traces of where the muscle would have met the bone to build up a picture of Beachy Head Lady's appearance . The female's skeleton suggests that the woman was around 30 years old when she died in 245AD. Experts believe she grew up in Sussex despite being from Sub-Saharan Africa. This is especially interesting as this area was beyond the reaches of the Roman Empire. Because she was not found with any grave goods, archaeologists are unable to deduce what social status she was. It is however possible that she was the wife or mistress of an official. She may also have been a merchant traveller too. ‘Without the context of seeing the burial site or grave goods, we don’t yet know why she was here, or her social status. ‘However based on what we know of the Roman era and a similar discovery in York, it’s possible she was the wife of a local official or mistress of the extensive Roman villa which is known to be close to Eastbourne Pier, or she may have been a Merchant, plying the trade routes around the Mediterranean up to this remote European outpost.’ Mr Seaman said that isotopes showed the Beachy Head Lady was raised in or around Eastbourne from a young age. He said the skeleton was in good condition with no signs of hard labour. Eastbourne museums paired up with the University of Dundee to use Radio-Isotope Analysis to examine bones and teeth for trace elements absorbed from food and water during an individual’s lifetime, giving a geological fingerprint to the region in which they grew up. Her full skeleton is on show for the first time to the public at Eastbourne Borough Council’s museum service which was awarded a grant of £72,000 by the Heritage Lottery Fund. Beachy Head Lady's full skeleton is on show for the first time to the public at Eastbourne Borough Council's museum service which was awarded a grant of £72,000 by the Heritage Lottery Fund . Beachy Head is a chalk headland in Southern England, close to the town of Eastbourne . The skeleton makes up part of the Eastbourne Ancestors project at the museum. The aim was to identify the gender and age of each skeleton in its collection to build up stories about them. Testing of the bones and teeth has identified the national or regional origins, age, gender, state of health, diet, and in some cases, how they died. The researchers were also able to use the size of the skull and traces of where the muscle . would have met the bone to build up a picture of her appearance. Most of the skeletons are Anglo-Saxon, from about 1,500 years ago, but some are Neolithic and more than 4,000 years old. Eastbourne Borough Council Cabinet Member for Tourism and Leisure, Cllr Carolyn Heaps said: ‘It is very exciting to open the first local history related exhibition in ten years. ‘The exhibition is focused on telling the stories of those that date back to Prehistory, giving an insight into what they may have worked as, what cultures they may have adopted as well as their age and gender.’ The skeleton was first discovered in Beachy Head (pictured) in 1953, and she is thought to have lived around AD245 - the middle of the Roman period in Britain .","Skeleton of 30-year-old was found in Beachy Head, East Sussex in 1953 .

"Footballer Titus Bramble has been cleared of groping a woman and repeatedly sexually assaulting another woman. The Sunderland defender had been accused of groping a woman's bottom in the Cross Keys nightclub in Yarm, Teesside, before repeatedly sexually assaulting another woman in a cab home. He was cleared at Teeside Crown Court this afternoon after a four day trial. Scroll down for video . In the clear: Titus Bramble, pictured this afternoon, has been cleared of groping a woman and repeatedly sexually assaulting another at Teeside Crown Court after a four day trial . Summing up the case, Judge Peter Fox . told the jury: 'There needs to be proof of the sexual touching of the . girl in question (and) that girl in question at the time did not agree . to it.' Bramble, 30, of Wynyard near Middlesbrough, had denied all charges. A jury of five men and seven women took just over an hour to reach a unanimous verdict. Bramble, who was wearing a grey suit, showed little emotion as the foreman delivered a not guilty verdict for each charge. Bramble, pictured before the verdict this morning, told jurors that one of the complainants was 'touchy feelie and flirty' and kissed him 'passionately' He said nothing to reporters as he left court with his legal team and got into a waiting Mercedes, which sped away. He later issued a statement, which read: 'It has been extremely tough to have this hanging over me for the last eight months. 'I am naturally delighted that the jury returned not guilty verdicts so quickly  and relieved that this awful ordeal is finally over. 'I've always said these allegations were false and untrue. I would like to thank my solicitor Phil Smith from Tuckers and my whole legal team. 'But, it has been especially hard on my family and friends. I'd like to thank them for all their love and support during a difficult time. 'My focus is now on moving forward and getting on with my career.' During the trial Bramble told jurors that one of the complainants was 'touchy feelie and flirty' and kissed him 'passionately' as they shared a taxi from the Cross Keys nightclub. Bramble said she kissed him and put her hand on his crotch during the journey. He said: 'We were kissing. We kissed a couple of times passionately. 'She was touching me and putting my hand on her leg.' But the complainant claimed he twice grabbed her hand and put it on his crotch and placed his hand between her legs, which made her 'scared'. The taxi driver believed something was wrong and drove the pair to a police station where Bramble was arrested, the jurors were told. Bramble's defence lawyer Ronnie Jaffa said the woman made the allegation to 'save face' after she regretted kissing him. The other woman, who was in the Cross Keys, said she felt someone grope her bottom and turned to see Bramble. Bramble, of Wynyard near Middlesbrough, always denied it was him. She . reported the incident after the other woman claimed she was assaulted . in a taxi by the Sunderland star, which they caught in Yarm on the same . night - September 28 last year. The footballer, who has played for Ipswich, Newcastle and Wigan Athletic, consistently denied all charges. Bramble's brother Tesfaye was jailed for four-and-a-half years last year for raping a 19-year-old woman at a Newcastle hotel. Tesfaye had been out on a night out in the city with Titus before the woman was raped. Titus was orginally arrested along with his brother but later released without charge.

"A couple who had their two young children placed in foster care for nearly a year because of their use of medical marijuana are seeking punitive damages after a judge ruled that local welfare officials had no grounds for ever taking the children. Michael Lewis and Lauren Taylor are suing local Health and Human Services officials and police officers in Coronado, California, accusing them of false imprisonment, battery, negligence and civil rights violations, according to a lawsuit filed in San Diego Superior Court last month. The lawsuit stems from an incident on August 5, 2011, when local police received an anonymous tip that the couple were operating an illegal covert daycare operation and exposing children to marijuana. Michael Lewis and Lauren Taylor are suing local welfare officials and police officers in Coronado, California after their two sons were placed in foster care for nearly a year because of their use of medical marijuana . The couple, Michael Lewis and Lauren Taylor, have sued Coronado, two city police officers, the county and seven Health and Human Services department specialists, accusing them of false imprisonment, battery, negligence and civil rights violations, according to a lawsuit filed in San Diego Superior Court this month. Police found no evidence of a daycare center at the house, but they did find Lewis’ prescribed marijuana. A former Gulf War vet, he had been prescribed the drug to help alleviate migraines he suffered after being exposed to chemicals. Lewis was able to provide the cops with a valid California doctor's recommendation which they were happy to accept. But three days later, agents from the United States Department of Health and Human Services showed up at the family’s home, reports Courthousenews.com. A former Gulf War vet, Michael Lewis had been prescribed marijuana to help alleviate migraines he suffered after being exposed to chemicals . Citing the discovered marijuana as a ‘hazard’ in their official report, the agents removed the couple's two young boys - Cameran, then aged four, and Bailey, aged two - and placed them in an emergency shelter for ‘abused, abandoned, and neglected children’ in San Diego. Even though the Center immediately determined that the kids were ‘developmentally on target and there were no concerns for them’, the children were kept from their parents for a year. In their lawsuit, Lewis and his wife claim the County repeatedly lied to the Courts, inventing tales of 'abuse' and 'neglect' to keep the family separated. Lewis was accused of being a forger and a drug dealer who suffered from mental illness, while officials disregarded evidence that his marijuana use had been recommended by a physician and practiced away from the youngsters, and that Taylor did not use pot at all. After a year of anguish, Lauren Taylor had her boys returned after a judge ruled that the HHS had no grounds on which to continue holding them . Finally, on August 2, 2012, the children were returned to their parents after a judge ruled that the HHS had no grounds on which to continue holding them. The family was overjoyed at being reunited and now a year later has filed a lawsuit. They claim the misconduct by city and . county officials has cost them physically and emotionally - from costly . drug tests and supervised visitation to eviction and going a year . without the bond of family life. They are now suing for abduction of a child, invasion of privacy, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent infliction of emotional distress and false imprisonment and are seeking an unspecified amount of compensatory and punitive damages.

"ZOOM: HOW EVERYTHING MOVES by Bob Berman (Oneworld £8.99) Aristarchus, some 1,800 years before Copernicus (pictured), suggested that the Earth moves around the sun . Did you hear the one about the theoretical physicist who was pulled over for speeding on the motorway? He explained to the policeman that, as Einstein had shown, all motion is relative and thus, from his own point of reference, he wasn’t even moving. So the policeman gave him a parking ticket. Of course, simply because motion is relative — an idea that Galileo first articulated 300 years before Einstein — is not to say it doesn’t exist. And Bob Berman’s Zoom is an absorbing account of how motion is everywhere around us, and nothing in the universe is motionless. The pre-Socratic philosopher Heraclitus, who is said to have declared ‘Everything flows’, doesn’t get a look-in, but the reader is treated to a breezy narrative of scientists’ discoveries that things we once thought were static — even, it turns out, the magnetic poles — are actually in constant flux. Everything with temperature has motion. Until the 1960s, Berman tells us, physicists had thought that, if thermometers were placed sufficiently far from any stars, they could give a reading of absolute zero on the Kelvin scale. But they now know that the heat of the Big Bang is spread across the cosmos — although the universe is actually getting colder; it was twice as warm 8 billion years ago. Berman, an astronomer who has written a number of successful popular science titles, takes us on a journey in two senses. First is the book’s trajectory, moving from the cosmic through to the global (explaining phenomena such as the tectonic shifts of the continents, why Everest is getting taller, and why jet streams mean that a coast-to-coast flight in the U.S. uses 20 per cent less fuel going eastwards than westwards), and on to life forms (some bacteria move 100 times their body length in a second, you could outrun a mosquito but not a dragonfly, and your lymph fluids move at about a quarter of an inch a minute). We then head to more mind-stretching territory again, with quantum mechanics and discussion of the current scientific consensus that ‘particles and photons — matter and energy — apparently transmit knowledge across the entire universe instantly’. The second journey is a literal one, as Berman travels around the world to research the information for his book and to talk to leading scientists in their respective fields. He makes a trip to the Atacama Desert to visit the Carnegie-funded observatory in Chile, where the night sky is dark enough to gather the light from galaxies 8 billion light-years away. In an era in which scientists continue to hope for a ‘theory of everything’, an all-encompassing description of the universe that is profound and yet so concise it could fit as a slogan on a T-shirt, Berman offers us an ad hoc stand-in . There’s a trek to the equator to explore the Coriolis effect and a stay in Alaska to find out about the formation of snowflakes and the permutations of ice flows. Our peripatetic researcher even travels to the Greek island of Samos, where he garners material for just a footnote about Aristarchus, who, some 1,800 years before Copernicus, suggested that the Earth moves around the sun. In an era in which scientists continue to hope for a ‘theory of everything’, an all-encompassing description of the universe that is profound and yet so concise it could fit as a slogan on a T-shirt, Berman offers us an ad hoc stand-in — albeit the same as Heraclitus: ‘Stuff moves.’","Just because motion is  relative doesn't mean it doesn't exist .

"A brothel madam has been jailed for  trafficking woman into the UK and scaring them into prostitution  by making them eat live snakes in an African black magic ceremony. Lizzy Idahosa, 24, and her husband Jackson Omoruyi, 41, made more than £70,000 out of the Nigerian women, who were terrified with voodoo and made to see a witch doctor for a sinister 'juju' ceremony. Heavily pregnant Idahosa was sentenced to eight years today and broke down as she was told she would be separated from her child when it is born. Jailed: : Lizzy Idahosa, 24, found guilty of people trafficking after she forced two Nigerian women into prostitution by making them eat snakes in an African black magic ceremony, while her husband Jackson Omoruyi, 41, was convicted of money laundering . Omoruyi was sentenced to two years behind bars. Judge Tom Crowther told Idahosa she was the scheme's 'prime mover adding: 'You targeted vulnerable young women, offering them the hope of new lives, all the while knowing you would keep them in a kind of hell, from place to place at your whim, forced to pay an entirely arbitrary debt with their bodies, day in, day out over a period of years.' Idahosa was convicted of trafficking the women, inciting them to become prostitutes and transferring criminal property, while Omoruyi was found guilty of money laundering. During the couple's trial at Cardiff Crown Court, the jury was told that the two  victims, aged 23 and 29, had their pubic hair shaved and forced to eat live snakes and snails as part of the ritual, and then flown to Britain in the belief that they were going to find a better life. Speaking about her horrific ordeal the 29-year-old said: 'It was not a big snake, but it was alive.I just closed my eyes and put it in my mouth. She added: 'They told me if I messed if up, I would get sent back to Nigeria and Lizzy would kill me. I wanted to stop. I was ashamed of myself and I had no life.' When the women arrived in the UK they were put to work as prostitutes, working in brothels at massage parlours across England and Wales. Heavily pregnant Idahosa (left) was jailed for eight years, while Omoruyi (right) was sentenced to two years . They were told they had to give all the money they earned to Idahosa, and believed the black magic curses would make them go insane or die if they refused. 'The couple were involved in the exploitation of two women brought into the UK from Nigeria to work as prostitutes,' said Caroline Rees, prosecuting, during the trial. 'They were bound to this by something called a juju ritual. It was a ceremonial ritual used to full effect to terrify both women into doing what was demanded of them. 'It was used to ensure compliance, secrecy, and they believed if they broke the bond dire consequences would follow: illness, madness, infertility or death. 'They genuinely believed the powers would work.' The offences came to light after police arrested a 23-year-old Nigerian woman at the Ambassador Suite brothel in Cardiff, in June 2013. She told officers she had been living rough in Nigeria after her mother died and had wanted to travel to the UK to find her father. Investigation: The offences came to light after police arrested a 23-year-old Nigerian woman at the Ambassador Suite brothel in Cardiff, in June 2013 . She had then met a woman, claiming to be Idahosa's sister, who promised to make arrangements for her to travel to London, and as part of the agreement had to take part in the ceremony. 'She did not know what was expected of her,' said Ms Rees, who said the woman had been able to pass through immigration at Heathrow. 'She was taken to a premises full of women dressed in their underwear. There was no explanation as to what was going on but it soon became clear.' The woman started to work as a prostitute and was forced to have sexual intercourse with seven or eight men every day, working in brothels across the UK, including in Cardiff and Swansea. When interviewed, she claimed she had given Idahosa £45,000. The second victim told the court she had paid the defendants £31,400 over two years after working in brothels in Cardiff, Swansea, Barking and East Croydon, and said she had worked in South Wales for a year and eight months. The woman, who like her fellow victim cannot be named for legal reasons, said she had stopped working and changed her sim card so Idahosa could not contact her. However, within a month she received a phone call from her mother in Nigeria. 'I had a call from my mum who told me Lizzy's people had been to her house and threatened her,' the victim told the jury. 'Lizzy said if I did not pay her she would kill my mum and make me go mad.' Idahosa and Omoruyi, who were arrested at their home in London, denied any wrong doing. But police checked their bank accounts and found a series of transfers with Omoruyi acting as a 'financial middle man'. Idahosa had denied forcing the women to take part in a black magic ceremony, but claimed that she herself had been trafficked into the UK and forced to work as a prostitute. She told the jury she did not know the two women had been trafficked. 'It was only when I told them I was trafficked into the country that I found out they were trafficked,' she said. Idahosa, who is heavily pregnant, said she made an oath with her trafficker before leaving Nigeria and was forced to eat the roast heart of a cockerel. Trial: A jury at Cardiff Crown Court (pictured) took just five hours to find the couple guilty after the trial . She said: 'I wouldn't do the things they say I did because I've been through it.' The jury was told that cash payments of several hundred pounds a time had been deposited into Omoruyi's account from locations all over the country, including Glasgow, Sheffield and Southampton. He had claimed that money came from his friend. 'I am the kind of person who likes clothes and shoes and I'm known for that - I like to find bargains,' he said. 'It is not that it is any fraud money or anything. My account has not been used for anything like that.' During an interview with police, he said: 'I am here to say I do not even know the people you are talking about - I have never seen them. 'I have never involved myself in that kind of activity in this country, even before this country. I have not and I would not,' he had claimed. Christopher Drew, representing Omoruyi, of London, said: 'Since coming to this country, he has demonstrated a willingness to work honestly.' But Judge Crowther said he was 'certain' that Omoruyi knew the money was illegal and where it was coming from. Idahosa was convicted of a total of eight counts including trafficking two women into and around the UK, inciting them to become prostitutes and transferring criminal property. Omoruyi was convicted of two offences of money laundering. A jury at Cardiff Crown Court took just five hours to find them guilty. Both were remanded in custody today to be sentenced next month, but judge Tom Crowther QC warned them they will face lengthy custodial sentences. Speaking after the verdicts had been given, Ms Rees said: 'This was a despicable and callous crime. 'These two defendants were involved in an elaborate deception, taking advantage of cultural and financial issues in order to gain a devastating hold over their vulnerable victims. 'Once the victims had entered the UK, they were exploited and abused in the most brutal manner. Human trafficking is totally unacceptable in our society. 'I hope today's convictions will send a clear message that those who seek to degrade and demean others for their own personal gain can expect to be pursued and prosecuted to the full extent of the law. 'It took an immense amount of courage for the victims to come forward and seek to break free from their ordeal. I hope that their courage will act as an inspiration for others who may find themselves in a similar position. 'Whilst we cannot undo what has already happened to these victims, we can hope that today's convictions will help them as they try to move on from their ordeal.' A spokesman for the Home Office, which led the investigation, said: 'Trafficking is an appalling crime that has no place in today's society but, as this case has shown, it is taking place here. 'That is why we are taking action on a number of fronts. 'We are working with law enforcement overseas, the law is being strengthened and the Modern Slavery Bill, one of the first of its kind in the world, will make it easier to prosecute the criminals behind trafficking and improve the protection of victims.'","Lizzy Idahosa and husband Jackson Omoruyi made £70,000 from victims .

"A teacher has been charged with sexual assaults involving four of his students from the 1960s. Christopher Kloman, 73, was arrested on Friday at his home in McLean, Virginia after a yearlong investigation. The head of a northern Virginia private school says they are 'deeply disturbed' by the news that their former, longtime teacher has been charged with sexual assaults. Scandal: Christopher Kloman, 73, of Virginia has been arrested over alleged sexual abuse during his 29-year career at the esteemed Potomac School . Privilege: Staff, parents and pupils have been rocked by the sex scandal that has emerged and involves a former teacher at Potomac . Police opened the case after receiving a report from a 55-year-old woman who was a student of Kloman's at the Potomac School. She came forward after running into Kloman at the Washington Episcopal School, where he was teaching at the time. Police said their investigation found three other alleged victims, all girls ages 12 and 14 when the alleged incidents occurred between 1968 and 1969. The Potomac school was founded a . century ago and has grown from a small institution in D.C. to its large, . 90-acre grounds in Virginia. Approximately 1,000 . students attend the school. The campus includes nature trails, outdoor classrooms, two gyms, squash courts and a large performing arts center. Potomac is a popular school with the children of Washington's political elite. Former students include Keshia Knight Pulliam who played Rudy Huxtable on The Cosby Show; Davis Guggenheim – director of An Inconvenient Truth and Rory Kennedy, filmmaker and daughter of RFK.

"'Pervert': James Quigley, 34, an English teacher in Texas, has been charged with sexual assault and maintaining an improper relationship with his 16-year-old student who accused him of threatening her . A high school teacher from Texas has been arrested for allegedly having sex with a 16-year-old female student and presenting her with a contract offering the girl a high grade in return for her silence. James Quigley, 34, was taken into custody last Thursday after the victim’s parents called police to report that the Richardson High School English teacher had been sending their daughter sexually explicit text messages and emails beginning last March. The teenager told police that Quigley had threatened her, had sex with her on two occasions and then tried to talk her into signing a written contract stipulating that he would give her a good grade if she kept quiet about their relationship and stayed away from his wife, who also teaches at Richardson High School. Quigley has been charged with sexual assault and maintaining an improper relationship with a student. He is being held on $100,000 bond at the Dallas County Jail. According to a probable cause affidavit, the 16-year-old girl’s mother called police last week accusing James Quigley of harassing her daughter with emails and text messages . The mother said that the English teacher repeatedly tried to invite her daughter to go to the movies with him and told her they could be 'friends with benefits.' When interviewed by police, the teenage girl said that it all started last March when Quigley, who was her English teacher, requested her email address so he could send her information about an essay she had to turn in. Since then, the underage girl has been allegedly receiving messages from her married teacher telling her she was pretty and had a 'pretty neck.' Then in May or June of this year, Quigley allegedly showed up outside the girl's house with a 'hot dog for her dog.' The affidavit states that when she went to answer the door, Quigley hugged her, kissed her on the forehead and 'touched her butt.' The girl told police that she found Quigley parked in front of her house for no reason on multiple occasions, and that one time the 34-year-old educator confided in her that he thought of her while touching himself. Final straw: The victim told police that she stopped attending Quigley's class at Richardson High School after he left a Starburst candy along with a disturbing message on her desk . According to the affidavit, one day in class the girl found a Starburst candy on her desk with a note from Quigley that read: 'I would smash you into thin powder, mix you with water and drink it.' After that incident, the teen stopped attending the teacher’s English class and his tutoring sessions because he would always come up to her and make sexual comments about her neck, according to the affidavit. At one point, James Quigley allegedly approached the girl with a written contract and told her if she signed the document, he 'would give her an average of 85% or above in his class.' The agreement prohibited the teen from telling anyone what was happening between them and from 'getting anywhere close' to Quigley's wife, Carla Quigley, who also works at the Dallas-area high school. The 16-year-old refused to take the deal and left. She then allegedly sent the man several texts asking him to leave her alone. It was not until the girl's mother contacted police and brought her for an interview with detectives that the teen admitted that between May 1 and June 30, 2014, she and James Quigley twice had sex in her bed. The girl said that she had kept mum about the encounters because she was 'embarrassed and afraid,' adding that she has since received multiple massages from Quigley threatening her. James Quigley, who has taught at the school for five years, was placed on administrative leave following his arrest. According to online records, James Quigley and his wife, Carla, also 34 years old, have been married for six years.","James Quigley, teacher at Richardson High School in Texas, charged with sexual assault and maintaining an improper relationship with a student .

"It is a Friday night at New Bucks Head in Telford. Roy Hodgson has just watched England Under 20s dismantle Romania 6-0. He makes straight for coach Aidy Boothroyd. ‘Tell me more about the winger, Aarons,’ he demands. Hodgson, though, has already seen enough. He is considering an invite to train with the senior squad, as he is with a number of the young Lions. For what the England boss has just witnessed, a goal and man-of-the-match display on his international debut, is what many on Tyneside have been whispering about for a while — Rolando Aarons, the boy from Jamaica with a turn of foot like Usain Bolt and all the trickery of John Barnes. Rolando Aarons scores after seven minutes to set Newcastle on their way to shock win at Manchester City . The chance to join Steven Gerrard and Wayne Rooney at St George’s Park, however, never materialises due to a hamstring injury. But his name has been pencilled in. That was September. On Wednesday night, as he terrorised a Manchester City backline worth in excess of £40million, pencil turned to ink. It was he, on his return from that injury, who opened the scoring after just seven minutes to set Newcastle on their way to a shock 2-0 victory and in to the last eight of the League Cup. On Saturday, the 18-year-old could make his first Premier League start against Liverpool. Residing in the opposition team will be Raheem Sterling, 11 months his senior. Sterling was also born in Jamaica’s capital, Kingston, before moving to the UK at a young age. Comparison, therefore, is inevitable, not that Aarons invites such parallels. Aarons terrorised a Manchester City backline worth in excess of £40million on Wednesday night . ‘I’m not Raheem Sterling – and Raheem Sterling is not me,’ returns the sure-headed youngster, seemingly determined to forge his own path in the game. ‘Raheem Sterling has played really well for the last two or three seasons and I’ m nowhere near that level yet. I don’t want people to compare us, although he’s obviously a player that I admire.’ Comparisons? No. How about a shirt swap? ‘Hopefully I’ll get the chance to play in the same game as him, and if that happens I might ask for his shirt. Why not? He’s a good player,’ he says, before guarding against the mistake of Mario Balotelli. ‘Whatever happens, I definitely won’t be swapping at half-time though!’ Aarons continues: ‘But I’ve got a long way to go before I can even consider myself to be anywhere like (Sterling). He’s played for England at the World Cup, and I’ve only played three or four games for Newcastle United. I don’t think there’s any reason to get carried away.’ Newcastle manager Alan Pardew congratulates Aarons after League Cup success . The fact is, when the England manager is smitten after marvelling at 79 minutes on a non-league pitch at a remote Shropshire outpost, there is reason to get a little bit excited. ‘I’m aware of people talking, but it doesn’t really bother me,’ he says. ‘I’m just focusing on playing football, and what other people are saying about me, or the praise that I’ve been getting, doesn’t really affect what I’m doing. I know I can play much better than I have been.’ That last statement must sound as a warning for Newcastle’s upcoming opponents, starting with a Liverpool defence terrified of pace and cunning, both of which Aarons boasts. Aarons caught the eye of England boss Roy Hodgson with impressive display for the Under 20s . City discovered that when he sprung clear of their trailing rearguard before slotting through the legs of Willy Caballero. He made way at the break – ‘knackered’, he later explained – but perhaps Alan Pardew was saving Aarons to unleash on the out-of-form Reds. For his Newcastle manager, like Hodgson, is rather taken with the teen. ‘He has a nice temperament,’ says Pardew of the player who arrived at the club from Bristol City as a 15-year-old. ‘I think he had some troubles at Bristol City, but I really like him as a person. He has got his feet on the ground, he has got tremendous potential and this could be a breakthrough season for him.’ Teenager Aarons has drawn inevitable comparisons with Liverpool's Raheem Sterling . Pardew read an article on MailOnline earlier this week which suggested, according to data, that Everton’s Phil Jagielka is the quickest player in the top flight, prompting him to say: ‘I saw that Jagielka is apparently the quickest in the Premier League. ‘Well, I would bet Rolando and Gabriel Obertan against him any day of the week. His (Aarons) massive asset is his pace.’ Aarons, having already won admirers from the very top of the English game, certainly isn’t hanging about.","Roy Hodgson saw Rolando Aarons play starring role for England Under 20s .

"MY LIFE IN HOUSES by Margaret Forster (Chatto & Windus £14.99) To me, the description ‘a homemaker’ is a great compliment, but I’ve often wondered whether we do ‘make’ our homes, or whether they weave their own magic around our lives, slowly creating us in their own image. It’s an exercise in give and take: a working partnership with bricks and mortar — far more profound than the colours of paint or cushions. Novelist and biographer Forster certainly believes this. She begins her memoir by quoting Leonard Woolf: ‘Looking back on my life, I tend to see it divided into sections which are determined by the houses in which I have lived, not by school, university, work, marriage, death, division or war.’ ‘Paul came first, with Jane Asher, but for tea, not dinner . . . next came George and Pattie, but for an evening meal' Like Woolf, Forster believes your home determines every aspect of your life. Because of that, she tells her life story in terms of the roofs she has known — an interesting device, which enables her to withhold as many secrets as an ancient building in a ghost story. This is not an emotional memoir, since her (well-known) husband and children scarcely have walk-on parts. The emotional punch comes at the end — all the more powerful because of the reticence that has gone before. For this celebrated writer is facing her own death from cancer. The house she loves is now a refuge; it evokes a happy, creative past, but cannot shelter her from an inevitably sad future. Forster’s trajectory typifies the social mobility that, in the post-war period, helped to rebuild Britain and make it great. Good parents, an excellent grammar-school education, generous university grants, hard work and talent took her from a modest council house to a Georgian terrace in London, bought for a song 50 years ago, but now worth a fortune. £1,772 - Average spent per household per year on home improvements . Forster was born in 1938, ‘in the front bedroom of a house in Orton Road, a house on the outer edge of Raffles’, a council estate in Carlisle designed to provide homes for the ‘lucky’ deserving poor, who were still not quite worthy of indoor lavatories. (Many years later, she revisits this house, only to find it trashed by the undeserving poor: a bleak, dispiriting lesson in social change). Little Margaret quickly realised her home wasn’t as good as some of those she visited. She fantasised about views prettier than the one she had. The family’s move to a better council house (with an indoor loo) met with her approval as did the new fireplace funded by her grandfather: ‘I was as admiring as everyone else, failing to see how cheap and ugly it was.’ We are in the Fifties now, and Forster describes herself as a ‘swot’ — a lower-middle-class girl who loves studying in the ‘best’ front room and is destined for a scholarship to Somerville College, Oxford University. As a young woman Margaret quickly realised her home wasn’t as good as some of those she visited. However, the unsociable student doesn’t really like living in college (which sounds like inverted snobbery), so moves to lodgings in Winchester Road — the pretty house she leaves in 1960 to marry her sixth-form sweetheart, Hunter Davies. They rent a flat in London’s Hampstead and begin a life of extraordinarily prolific writing, with Forster producing a novel every year and Davies landing the first (and only) authorised biography of The Beatles, and a stellar career in journalism. There are lovely tales of landlords, landladies and fellow lodgers in an account that sometimes reads like one of Forster’s well-loved novels: full of sharp observation and gentle wit. In 1963, Forster and Davies obtained a £3,600, 20-year mortgage on a smelly, dark, ramshackle house — complete with a sitting tenant — in Kentish Town. Forster believes our homes tell our life story . Gradually, it becomes the Home of Homes, although Hunter and Margaret flit to Portugal (for tax reasons) for a while, and buy in Cumbria, too — near their Carlisle families. Their London home witnesses the births of three children, as well as the couple’s increasing success. Movies are made of their books and the house is visited by The Beatles (minus John): ‘Paul came first, with Jane Asher, but for tea, not dinner . . . next came George and Pattie, but for an evening meal. George was intent on philosophical discussion, and not much interested in the food . . . I made the same [aubergine dish] for Ringo and Maureen, but it turned out they were the sort of vegetarians who didn’t like vegetables other than potatoes.’ S ome may wish there were more anecdotes like that in this book. But Forster seems most happy when enjoying the isolation of her beloved Lake District house (where she and Davies spend a good deal of the year), or when her London door has closed and she can walk up to her beloved writing room. Although home is a refuge for most people, for Forster, it became the more so when she was first diagnosed with cancer at the age of 36. A mastectomy followed, then another in 1978. The idea of the human body as a home is simply, but beautifully, evoked: ‘It struck me that if, as many claim, the body is merely a house for the spirit and the mind, then its owner has to keep up constant surveillance.’ Now that her cancer has metastasised and she knows she is ‘lucky to be still alive’, home provides calm and consolation, making her feel ‘safe’ in her ‘nest’. Believing (as I firmly do) in the spirit of a place, I feel sure that this London home, with its cheerful yellow door, will forever contain the spirit of a remarkable woman, imprinted upon the walls she loves so much.","As a young woman Margaret quickly realised her home wasn’t as good as some of those she visited .

"A 22-year-old pregnant woman from Chicago has been accused of whipping to death her 3-year-old son with a belt and an electrical cord. Tylesha Griffin, of West Rogers Park, was charged with first-degree murder Sunday, two days after the child, Donnell Coakley, was found unresponsive in his bed. The toddler was rushed to St Francis Hospital, where he passed away a short time later. Monstrous charges: Tylesha Griffin (left), 22, from Chicago, was charged with first-degree murder in connection to the beating death of her 3-year-old son, Donnell Coakley (right) Too late: Paramedics arrived at the family's home in the 6500 block of North Seeley Avenue in Chicago Friday night . The death was classified as a homicide after an autopsy determined that little Donnell had suffered 'abusive injuries.' The boy was allegedly struck more than 100 times on his buttocks, legs, back, arms and head. Court documents cited by the local news blog RedEye Chicago indicate that the child suffered a chipped front tooth, a massive gaping wound exposing muscle on his left arm, and had patches of hair missing from his head. Tylesha Griffin's young son also had burn marks all over his body, and he may have been bound based on ligature markings on his wrists.

Harsh punishment: The 22-year-old, who is expecting another child, told police that Donnell was occasionally disciplined with a belt . Police officers responded to the woman's apartment in the 6500 block of North Seeley Avenue at 8.40pm Friday. Little Donnell succumbed to his injuries just over an hour later in the hospital. Earlier in the day, Griffin and her boyfriend left the toddler in the care of relatives to attend an appointment with the man’s parole officer, a police source told CBS Chicago. When they returned home, they reportedly discovered Donnell in bed with vomit around his mouth. Instead of taking him to the hospital, the parents cleaned the child up and tucked him in again. It was not until hours later that Griffin called 911 to report that her son was unresponsive, according to court documents. Fatal delay: It allegedly took Griffin (left and right) and her boyfriend hours to seek medical help for their son . Griffin and Donnell's father returned home from meeting the man's parole officer and discovered the toddler lying in bed in his own vomit . When questioned by police about the wounds on her son's body, Miss Griffin allegedly said that Donnell was occasionally disciplined with a belt.

"A 32-year-old teacher who is accused of having group sex with a 16-year-old student and her 24-year-old colleague has pleaded not guilty to a separate felony charge relating to the teenager. Shelley Dufresne, an English teacher at Destrehan High School, allegedly participated in the threesome with the unnamed student and faculty member, Rachel Respess, on September 12. The married mother-of-three also reportedly had sex with the 11th grade teenager on another occasion at her home in Montz, Louisiana, at some point between August 22 and September 27. During a 10-minute arraignment on Tuesday afternoon, she entered a not guilty plea via her attorney, Deanne Williams, to a felony count of having carnal knowledge of a juvenile. Scroll down for video . Denial: English teacher Shelley Dufresne (right) appeared in court on Tuesday to plead not guilty to charges she had sexual relations with one of her 16-year-old male students.

Threesome: 32-year-old Dufresne (left) and co-worker Rachel Respess, 24 (right), were arrested after the underage student in question started telling friends and the scandal through Destrehan High School, where they worked . Dufresne remains free on $200,000 bond, but will stay under house arrest until her trial. She had no comment as she left the courthouse in Hahnville, according to The Times-Picayune. According to prosecutors, Dufresne had an ongoing affair with the student, whom she taught at the high school in Destrehan, a sleepy commuter town west of New Orleans. The teacher, whose children are aged three, five and seven, was also separately booked on October 1 in Jefferson Parish on suspicion of having group sex with the student and Respess. The threesome allegedly occurred at Respess's Kenner apartment on September 12, after Dufresne picked up the teen from a Friday Night Lights high school footbal game. Scene: Above, Detrehan High School where the two accused teachers taught and their victim was a student . Behind closed doors: The threesome allegedly happened at Respess's apartment on September 12, after Dufresne picked up the boy from a high school football game . The teachers were caught after the boy told friends that he was sleeping with them, police say. Word soon traveled around the high school campus and school authorities brought in the cops. Following the incident, both teachers were booked by police on charges of having carnal knowledge of a juvenile, indecent behavior with a juvenile and contributing to the delinquency of a juvenile. The Jefferson Parish district attorney's office is yet to decide whether or when it will file charges against the pair, whose bonds total $7,000, for the alleged threesome. Earlier this month, Judge Anne Simon agreed to loosen the rules of Dufresne's house arrest, allowing her to attend a Jazzercise program as part of her treatment for depression. Under the new rules, the suspect can also play a greater role in helping her husband Wesley care for their three children by taking them to school, doctor's appointments and extra-curricular activities.

"TV presenter Piers Morgan last night called arch-enemy Jeremy Clarkson a chicken after the Top Gear man refused to face him in a boxing ring. The chat show host challenged Clarkson to a punch-up to settle their 14-year-long feud. Morgan, 48, said that the match would be in aid of Help For Heroes with the loser paying £100,000 to the Forces' charity. When Morgan was the editor of a tabloid newspaper he published pictures of Clarkson, 53, getting friendly with a female work colleague - after Clarkson had denied any wrongdoing. Four years later, Clarkson  punched Morgan at an awards ceremony in London. Recently, Clarkson teased Morgan on Twitter and in a newspaper after his CNN show Piers Morgan Live was by CNN. Feuding: Piers Morgan, left, was editing a newspaper when the feud with Jeremy Clarkson, right, began . However Morgan tweeted: ‘He talks a good game, let's see if @JeremyClarkson has the b***s to walk it too. £100k charity fight – yes or no, Fatboy?’ Clarkson refused to rise to the bait: ‘I'm not going to box Piers Morgan. I'm too busy’ later adding ‘Leave me alone. I’ve got a job to do.’ Morgan responded: ‘Cluck, cluck cluck.’ Jeremy Clarkson (right) and Piers Morgan on Concorde in 2003 . The battle between Piers Morgan and Jeremy Clarkson began in November 2000. Morgan was the editor of the Daily Mirror when he was sent a set of paparazzi photos showing Clarkson in an embrace with TV producer Elaine Bedell. Morgan rang Clarkson and offered a deal if Clarkson co-operated. Clarkson claimed Bedell was just a friend and, according to Morgan, added: ‘I’m not physically capable of having an affair. You can ask my wife.’ Morgan published the pictures anyway. Clarkson was not happy. In May 2002, at a wedding Clarkson and his wife Frances lay into Morgan for publishing the photos. Morgan apologised. Five months later, more photographs appeared of Clarkson and Bedell together and Clarkson again insisted they were innocent. A year later, Morgan and Clarkson were on the last flight of Concorde. Despite the fact that Clarkson told other passengers that Morgan ‘is a little ****’ and he was going to ‘punch his lights out,’ BA put Clarkson in the seat directly in front of Morgan. As Clarkson took his seat he said, ‘oh, ******* hell, I’ve got a **** behind me.’ ‘And I’ve got one in front of me, too,’ Morgan replied. Morgan taunted Clarkson: ‘Come on big man, show me what you’ve got.’ Clarkson then tipped a glass of water over Morgan. In March 2004, they both attended the British Press Awards. Clarkson swung at Morgan and hit his temple and forehead. The next day, Morgan announced: ‘I think it’s fair to say he was a little inebriated. I’ve frankly taken worse batterings from my three-year-old son.’ Clarkson admitted: ‘He’s won really. This is just one in a long line of clashes. We’ll have to kiss and make up.’ Clarkson, however, did the opposite. The following month, he appeared on Michael Parkinson’s TV show, and said: ‘I don’t get on with Piers Morgan, so I punched him,’ adding, ‘Every woman I meet asks me, “Why did you hit him?” And every man asks, “Where did you hit him?”’ In December 2012 in the wake of the shooting of 20 pupils and six staff at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, Morgan called for a gun ban, leading pro-gun Americans to call for him to be deported from the U.S. On Christmas Eve Clarkson tweeted: ‘Americans. It took us 40 years to get rid of Piers Morgan. Please don’t send him back.’ Clarkson also tweeted repeatedly when Morgan had his nightly show dropped by CNN, then used one of his newspaper columns to launch a long attack on the host. If he had hoped to offend Morgan, he failed. 'Dear old @JeremyClarkson warned I wouldn't like what he's written about me tomorrow. I just read it, and LOVED IT!

"Lines of credit: Tony Blair has taken out a £4.2million loan from JP Morgan against his central London home . Tony Blair has taken a £4.2million loan secured against his family home from the US bank he advises, it emerged yesterday. The former Prime Minister received the seven-figure mortgage from JP Morgan, which pays him £2.5million a year for his advice. It was unclear last night why Mr Blair needs a capital injection of £4.2million, with his office declaring it a ‘private matter’. In the past he has taken out mortgages on his properties to help fund further investments, and sources suggest he may be looking for an overseas home to add to his portfolio. One said yesterday: ‘It would not surprise me if Blair was hunting for a place in the sun, somewhere like the Caribbean or Tuscany. ‘He doesn’t ski, so you can rule out a chalet.’ Mr Blair’s £17million property portfolio already includes homes in central London, in the country and properties for each of his three elder children. The latest mortgage is secured against the family home in Connaught Square, central London – purchased in 2004 for £3.65million. Mr Blair later extended it by buying the mews house behind and the property is now worth an estimated £7.5million. In addition, Mr Blair and his  wife Cherie own a seven-bedroom mansion in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, worth £5.75million –  where, as revealed in the Daily Mail,  they are undertaking elaborate renovations. They have also bought three houses worth between £1.5million and £1million for their children Nicky, Euan and Kathryn. Consultancy work: JP Morgan's New York City headquarters. Mr Blair's office denied speculation he received preferential treatment from the bank . And in 2010, there was speculation . that Mr Blair was set to buy a £4million home on Barbados after he spent . three consecutive summers while Prime Minister staying at Cliff . Richard’s six-bedroom villa on the island’s exclusive west coast, though . nothing came of it. Mr Blair’s lucrative consultancy . services and other work since leaving politics are thought to earn him . around £20million a year. Last week it emerged that the former . Labour Party leader helped mediate a deal between mining giant Xstrata . and commodities trader Glencore, on which JP Morgan is a key advisor – . though Mr Blair’s involvement is said to be separate. Yesterday his office denied . speculation that he received the loan on ‘preferential’ terms from the . bank for helping to mediate on the merger. Security: Mr Blair's home in Connaught Square, central London, which he has put up for collateral on the loan . He was called in to help by Glencore chief executive Ivan Glasenberg. Qatar, a key investor in Xstrata, insisted that Glencore raise its offer or it would veto the deal. The Sunday Times reported that Mr . Blair was asked by Mr Glasenberg to hold a meeting at Claridge’s, the . five-star hotel in Mayfair, with Qatar’s prime minister, Sheikh Hamad . Bin Jassim Bin Jabr Al-Thani. It is thought the sheikh accepted the . deal after Mr Blair secured an improved offer – although it will only . be finalised in a few weeks’ time. He is understood to have earned a . £620,000 fee for easing the merger’s path, and is in addition likely to . earn a seven-figure ‘success fee’. He is also said to earn £1million a year advising Zurich Financial Services. A spokesman for Mr Blair’s office . said last night: ‘This isn’t a mystery,  it’s a non-story about . someone’s private mortgage arrangements. ‘The mortgage has nothing at all to . do with Mr Blair’s work for JP Morgan and any suggestion of preferential . treatment is incorrect, untrue and quite frankly total nonsense.’","Former PM receives seven-figure mortgage from JP Morgan, who pay him £2.5million a year for advice .

"Suspect: Erbie Bowser was arrested last night after the shooting rampage . At least four people have been killed and another four injured in two related shooting incidents in southwest Dallas on Wednesday night. Relatives of one of the woman killed in the shooting spree identified the suspect as the woman's . ex-boyfriend, Erbie Bowser, a former Dallas Mavericks ManiAAC dancer. Toya Smith, 43, and her 17-year-old daughter Tasmia Allen died in the shooting, as did another of her children, who has not yet been identified. Toya's 14-year-old son Storm Malone was among those shot and taken to the hospital, according to WFAA. One of Tasmia's 17-year-old friends was also shot and taken to hospital. Radio station CBSDFW reported that when Bowser - an army veteran - did not find his ex-girlfriend at the address, he opened fire. Two people were killed and two others wounded at that address. He is then believed to have went to a home in DeSoto, Texas, where he reportedly used an explosive . device to gain entry to the property. After it detonated, he allegedly shot several people inside, killing two and injuring two more. Victims: Toya Smith, right, 43, and her daughter Tasmia Allen, left, 17, died in shooting and Toya Smith's son Storm, 14, was taken to hospital with a gunshot wound . Reports: When Bowser was arrested he allegedly kept repeating his name, rank and serial number. He also reportedly has tattoos identifying him as being in the military . Cheerleaders: Suspect Erbie Bowser, center, is believed to be part of an NBA dance troupe called the Mavericks Dallas ManiACCs . Four people have died and four more have been injured in two related shootings in Dallas . Sources said children were among the victims of the rampage on Wednesday night . The home belonged to his ex-wife, who hasn't been identified. It is not yet known if she is one of the victims. Dallas police said the attack only ended when Bowser ran out of ammunition. The distraught mother of one of the victims told NBC: 'And we could hear somebody gasping for breath in there and...I start beating on the door. 'I . ran next door, across the street trying to get people to help because I . had my cellphone but I didn't know to use my cellphone. Then she fell . in my arms and she was bleeding and I moved her back to the sofa.' WFAA . reported that the gunman - believed to . be a member of the military - tried to disguise himself as one of the . injured but is now being questioned at DPD headquarters. U.S. Army officials confirmed that Bowser served from October 1991 to November 2000, rising to the rank of staff sergeant. Laura Jobe, a spokeswoman for the Mesquite Independent School District, told NBC Bowser was employed as a special education teacher from December 2001 to March of 2010.

"Senior Tory politicians took part in drink and drug-fuelled sex parties with underage boys during seaside conferences, it was claimed today. Former activist Anthony Gilberthorpe says he was handed cash and told to ‘fetch entertainment’ - code for young boys – by members of Margaret Thatcher’s government. But the claims were today rejected as ‘tittle-tattle’ by former Conservative minister David Mellor, who insisted those named were dead and unable to defend themselves. Former activist Anthony Gilberthorpe, left, claims he was asked to find underage boys for sex during Tory party conferences when Margaret Thatcher was leader in the early 1980s . Westminster has been gripped by claims of an Establishment cover-up of allegations of child sex abuse over several decades. The government has appointed former High Court judge Baroness Butler-Sloss to lead a wide-ranging panel inquiry into abuse at every level of society. Mr Gilberthorpe says he will give the inquiry the names of former Tory ministers, some of whom are still alive, who he claims he saw with young men at party conferences. He claims he sent a 40-page dossier to Mrs Thatcher in 1989 detailing Cabinet ministers who took part in the sex parties, bur says he was warned off by a senior civil servant. He told the Sunday Mirror how boys as young as 15 were plied with alcohol and cocaine at Conservative gatherings in Blackpool and Brighton in the 1980s. He named former former-Education Secretary Keith Joseph, ex-local government minister Rhodes Boyson, and Michael Havers, the former attorney general who is the brother of Baroness Butler-Sloss. All of those Mr Gilberthorpe names are now dead. Mr Gilberthorpe alleges that during the 1983 party conference in Blackpool he was asked by Dr Alistair Smith, the Conservative party chairman in Scotland, to find young boys for two Cabinet ministers to have sex with. The ministers are not named, but he does claim that Mr Boyson and Mr Joseph were there. Mr Gilberthorpe told the Sunday Mirror: 'Dr Smith, who I looked up to at the time and was the most important Tory in Scotland, told me to go and fetch some 'entertainment', which was code for young boys and handed me a handful of bank notes. There was about £120. He added: 'It was a norm and an open secret that these older members of the Tory party, like Dr Smith, paid for young men to join them at sex parties. 'I was expected to find the youngest and prettiest boys. It was what those men wanted. In fact, it was all they wanted.’ He also claimed that selected people had an Oscar award symbol on their conference pass to give them access to secret sex parties. Mr Gilberthorpe alleges that in 1981 he went to a party in Blackpool where ‘several boys who were clearly aged between 15 and 16’ were performing sex acts on MPs. He claims he saw Sir Michael Havers there. Baroness Butler-Sloss has faced calls to stand down from her role leading the panel inquiry because her brother was in the Cabinet at the time many of these allegations date from. He also claims that during the 1984 party conference in Brighton there was a sex party at the Grand Hotel on the night before an IRA bomb killed five people. Mr Gilberthorpe says he was ‘manipulated and groomed’ by the senior politicians. ‘It is time this came to light before anyone else is abused,’ he added. But the allegations were dismissed by Mr Mellor, a former Tory Cabinet minister who served in the Thatcher and Major governments. Former Tory minister David Mellor, pictured today, dismissed Mr Gilberthorpe's claims as a 'lot of tittle-tattle' about people who were dead and cannot defend themselves . He told BBC One’s Andrew Marr show: ‘The only people who are named are dead. There is an opportunity to name live people. ‘What we are dealing with is a lot of tittle-tattle. Here is a chap who was annoyed that he wasn’t chosen as a Tory candidate.’ He added: ‘It names a lot of dead people. Where is the bravery in that?’ Mr Mellor said Mr Gilberthorpe had made public ‘implausible names’ in connection with the sex parties. ‘This is now open season because of a pretty shoddy dossier presented to Leon Brittan by a Tory backbencher.’ Geoffrey Dickens handed the file to the then-Home Secretary in 1983, but the Home Office says it can now not be found. Mr Mellor, a Home Office minister from 1983-87, added: ‘The interesting thing about that dossier is nobody who has commented on it has ever seen it.’ The chilling claims that a paedophile ring may have been operating within the British establishment first emerged in an investigation by campaigning Conservative politician Geoffrey Dickens. In November 1983, the MP for Littleborough and Saddleworth in Greater Manchester sent a 40-page document to then Home Secretary Leon Brittan detailing alleged VIP child abusers, apparently including former Liberal party chief whip Cyril Smith and other senior politicians. In a newspaper interview at the time, Mr Dickens claimed his dossier contained the names of eight 'really important public figures' that he planned to expose, and whose crimes are believed to have stretched back to the 1960s. November 1983: . Geoffrey Dickens produces a huge dossier detailing allegations of sexual abuse against prominent figures in the British establishment. He tells his family the claims will 'blow apart' the VIP paedophile ring. March 1984: . Home Secretary Leon Brittan tells Mr Dickens that his dossier has been assessed by prosecutors and passed on to the police, but no further action is taken. The dossier is now either lost or missing. May 1995 . Geoffrey Dickens dies. A short time later his wife destroys his copy of the paedophile dossier. The only other copies - one received by Mr Brittan and another allegedly sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions - are believed to have been lost or destroyed. September 2010 . The 29-stone Rochdale MP Sir Cyril Smith dies aged 82 without ever being charged with sex offences. 2011/2012: . Following the death of Sir Jimmy Savile, dozens of claims of historic child abuse emerge - including a number of alleged victims of Smith, who is said to have spanked and sexually abused teenage boys at a hostel he co-founded in the early 1960s. October 2012 . During Prime Minister's Questions, Labour MP Tom Watson claims there is 'clear intelligence suggesting a powerful . paedophile network linked to Parliament and No10'. November 2012 . Lancashire Police announced they will be investigating claims of sexual abuse by Smith relating to incidents before 1974, while Greater Manchester Police will investigate claims after 1974. November 2012 . The Crown Prosecution Service admits Smith should have been charged with crimes of abuse more than 40 years earlier. The CPS also admitted Smith had been investigated in 1970, 1974, 1998, and 1999 but rejected every opportunity to prosecute him. November 2012 . A former special branch officer, Tony Robinson, says a historic dossier 'packed' with information about Smith's sex crimes was actually in the hands of Mi5 - despite officially having been 'lost' decades earlier. December 2012 . Scotland Yard sets up Operation Fairbank to investigate claims a paedophile ring operated at the Elm Guest House in Barnes, southwest London, in the 1970s and 80s. Among those abusing children are said to have been a number of prominent politicians. February 2013 . Operation Fernbridge is established to investigate the Elm Guest House alleged  paedophile ring. February 2013 . It is claimed a 'paedophile ring of VIPs' also operated at the Grafton Close Children's Home in Richmond, Surrey. February 2013 . Two men, a Catholic priest from Norwich, and a man understood to be . connected to Grafton Close, arrested on suspicion of sexual offences and questioned by Operation Fernbridge officers. June 2013 . Scotland Yard claims that seven police officers are working full time on Operation Fernbridge and are following more than 300 leads. June 2013 . Charles Napier, the half-brother of senior Conservative politician John Whittingdale, is arrested by Operation Fairbank officers. December 2013 . Some senior Labour party politicians linked to pro-paedophile campaign group the Paedophile Information Exchange, which was affiliated with the National Council for Civil Liberties pressure group, now known as Liberty, in the 1970s and early 1980s. December 2013 . Police search the home of Lord Janner as part of a historical sex abuse investigation. He is not arrested. February 2014 . Current . deputy leader of the Labour Party Harriet Harman, who was NCCL's . in-house lawyer at the time of its affiliation with PIE and even met her . husband Jack Dromey while working there, is forced to deny she . supported the activities of the pro-paedophile collective. February 2014 . Patricia Hewitt, Labour's former . Secretary of State for Health who was NCCL's general secretary for nine . years, later apologised and said she had been 'naive and wrong' to . consider PIE a legitimate campaign group. June 2014 . Lord Janner's Westminster office is searched by police. Again the peer is not arrested. July 3, 2014 . Labour MP Simon Danczuk called on Leon Brittan to say what he knew about the Dickens dossier. It emerges the dossier has now been either lost or destroyed and the Home Office admits it can find no evidence of any criminal inquiry relating to it. July 5, 2014 . More than 10 current and former politicians are said to be on a list of alleged child abusers held by police investigating claims of an alleged paedophile ring. July 6, 2014 . Home Office permanent secretary Mark Sedwill reveals that 114 . files relating to historic allegations of child sex abuse, from between 1979 . and 1999, have disappeared from the Home Office. It is also revealed that former Home Secretary Lord Brittan was accused of raping a student in 1967. The 2012 allegation was not investigated until Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders ordered the Met Police to re-open the case in June this year.","Anthony Gilberthorpe says he was given cash to ‘fetch entertainment’

"Archaeologists in Spain claim they have found one of the world's earliest known images of Jesus - and he doesn't have a beard. The figure is engraved on a glass plate dating back to the 4th Century AD, according to Spanish reports. He is flanked by two apostles, believed to be Peter and Paul. The scene is striking because Jesus looks very different from later depictions - he has no beard, short, curly hair and is wearing what appears to be a philosopher's toga. Beardless: An engraving of Jesus believed to be from the 4th Century AD has been discovered, and shows him with short curly hair and no beard, contrary to traditional depictions . Pieced together: The glass plate is one of the earliest known depictions of Jesus Christ . This is a far cry from the traditional depictions we are used to today, of a bearded Jesus with long, brown hair. All three of the men have halos over their heads. The plate is believed to have been used to hold Eucharistic bread as it was consecrated in early Christian rituals. It measures 22cm in diameter and fragments of it were unearthed by scientists working for the FORVM MMX project inside a religious building in the ancient town of Castulo in Andalusia, southern Spain. Recreation: An image of what the plate would have looked like based on the pieces which have been found . Marcelo Castro, head of the FORVM MMX excavation project, said the building was erected in the second half of the fourth century AD and abandoned about a century later, The Local reports. The find has made scientists 'review the chronology of early Christianity in Spain', FORVM MMX project director Marcelo Castro told El Mundo newspaper. The pieces were in an excellent state of preservation - 81 per cent of its original area has now been pieced together by scientists.

"A hungry hyena has found a clever way to store its leftovers for another meal - by hiding them at the bottom of a waterhole. Photographer Anja Denker, 46, said she spotted the hyena seemingly fishing in the water at the Chudop waterhole in Etosha, Namibia. But on closer inspection it became clear that the predator was actually trying to dive for something specific. Down we go: The hyena was seemingly fishing in the water at the Chudop waterhole in Etosha, Namibia .

Success: After a few attempts it came back to the surface with a chuck of meat proudly locked in its jaws - ripped from a carcass . After a few attempts it came back to the surface with a chuck of meat proudly locked in its jaws - ripped from a carcass left at the river bed. Mrs Denker, from Windhoek, Namibia, said: ‘I found a lone hyena circling the middle of the waterhole with only its head sticking out. ‘I've seen hyenas sitting in water to cool themselves off before but never have I seen one this much submerged before. ‘To my absolute astonishment it proceeded to dive down head-first to the bottom and came up with something in its mouth. ‘I eventually came to the conclusion it was fishing - it proved very entertaining and I watched these antics for quite a while. Approaching: The photographer set up her camera gear and waited for the hyena to bring something up to the surface and onto land . Hungry: Other hyenas wait outside the Chudop waterhole in Etosha, Namibia, hoping to share the meat . Getting in the action: This was the only spotted hyena displaying the skilled behaviour, according to the photographer . ‘Looking at the photographs later that evening I studied the object in its mouth more closely and found it didn't resemble any fish. ‘Next morning I trundled off to the same waterhole and sure enough, the same hyena was doing exactly the same thing as the previous day.’ Mrs Denker set up her camera gear and waited for the hyena to bring something up to the surface and onto land. She added: ‘The hyena came up with a large chunk of something and swam to shore. ‘Only then did it dawn on me there must be a carcass lying at the bottom of the waterhole.

"San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick has been named in a police report by a woman who claims she blacked out after smoking marijuana and drinking in his company. Miami police are looking into the 'suspicious incident' after the unnamed woman said she kissed Kaepernick and later woke up in hospital without any memory of what had happened the night before. Earlier reports said that Kaepernick, 26, was being investigated for possible sexual assault, but the police report does not allege any specific crimes and no charges have been filed. The woman said she visited Seattle Seahawks wide receiver Ricardo Lockette, 27, at an apartment in the Viceroy, a luxury hotel that has rooms and residences, and he was there with Kaepernick and 49ers wide receiver Quinton Patton, 23, according to a police report. Star footballer: Colin Kaepernick, quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers, was named in the report .

The men then left - and she cannot remember what happened after that, she said. But . she woke up in a hospital bed in the middle of the night and 'doesn't . remember how she got there or who transported her to the hospital', the . report said. 'There's no evidence of a crime or a sexual assault,' a police spokesperson said of the report. 'This report is simply an incident report taken at the woman's request.' According to Kapernick's Instagram . account, he is in Miami to train and has been to the Viceroy Hotel as . recently as April 5, where he was pictured hanging out with a wedding . party by the pool.

"Barry Steenkamp said he was struggling 'to find some reason why this happened to our lovely daughter' Blade Runner’s best friend has told how he received a phone call moments after Reeva Steenkamp had been shot dead and a distraught Oscar Pistorius later crying ‘My baba, I’ve killed my baba. God take me away.’ Before the Paralympic medallist called the emergency services he phoned Justin Divaris, 27, at 3.55am to tell him what had happened. ‘I said to him, “What are you talking about?” He then repeated himself – “There has been a terrible accident, I shot Reeva”,’ he told the Sunday People. By the time the businessman had rushed to the athlete's luxury Pretoria home it had already been sealed off by police, but Mr Divaris described seeing the model 'covered in blankets and towels'. Members of both families have spoken out today as Pistorius’ father Henke 59, said he had ‘zero doubt’ the fatal shooting was a mistake saying his son had ‘acted on instinct’. The father of the South African model allegedly murdered by Oscar Pistorius spoke movingly yesterday of his family’s grief – and said he bore the athlete no animosity. In an emotional interview with The Mail on Sunday, Barry Steenkamp said he was struggling ‘to find some reason why this happened to our lovely daughter’. Pistorius broke down in tears in court when he was formally charged with Reeva Steenkamp’s premeditated murder and Mr Steenkamp said: ‘He must be going through things that we don’t know about. There is no hatred in our hearts.’ The athlete's father Henke Pistorius told the Sunday Telegraph a sportsman's 'instinct' was behind the tragedy, and said the family has pledged to do whatever it takes to clear Oscar's name. Further details of the events at Pistorius’ Pretoria mansion in the early hours of Valentine’s Day have come to light as is was unveiled that he tried to give Miss Steenkamp the kiss of life. After Oscar Pistorius carried his girlfriend’s blood-soaked body from the bathroom where she was shot, he tried to revive her, sources close to the investigation told the Sun. ‘There was a great deal of blood and they were convinced Reeva was still alive at that point when Pistorius was giving her the kiss of life, but she died soon after,’ a South African source said last night. Yesterday speculation about whether Ms Steenkamp's relationship with a playboy rugby player could have been behind a possible row which may have led to her tragic death. South African reports have linked the 29-year-old to Springbok Francois Hougaard - a close friend of Pistorius - according to the Sunday Mirror. Rugby star Francois Hougaard's agent said the 'sad ordeal' was nothing to do with him in response to rumours that had circulated about the nature of the Springbok's friendship with Miss Steenkamp . The 24-year-old failed to turn out for a scheduled match with his side the Vodacom Bulls in the days after Ms Steenkamp's death. The pair, who have been friends for a number of years and were in regular contact via Twitter, are understood to have dated in the past. Among those to comment on the speculation surrounding their relationship on Twitter were Nelson Mandela's personal assistant, whose reference to 'rumours about a rugby player alleged to be involved somehow' was later retweeted by South African journalist Barry Bateman to his 18,000 strong Twitter following. Ms Steenkamp had been dating Pistorius, a double-amputee known as the Blade Runner, since November. It . has been reported she was hit four times by bullets fired through the . door of a bathroom. Pistorius, 26, a keen marksman, owned a pistol and . machine gun. Sources told . how he carried his dying girlfriend from the bathroom, her blood . splattering the staircase, as he desperately tried to revive her. The pair had been called South . Africa’s ‘golden couple’, and the arrest of Pistorius – who in London . last year became the first man to compete at both an Olympics and . Paralympics – was met with disbelief. Miss Steenkamp's father Barry wept as he said he and his wife June were at 'a complete loss' Blade Runner: Oscar Pistorius ran in both the London 2012 Olympics and Paralympics . Speaking . for the first time since the death of his law graduate daughter, Mr . Steenkamp, a horse trainer, wept as he said he and his wife June were at . ‘a complete loss’. He . said: ‘This is a very difficult time for us. June is inconsolable. We . just need to find some answers. We ask the Lord every day to help us . find a reason why this should happen to Reeva. She was the most . beautiful, kind girl in the world. She had love for everyone, and she . was loved by everyone who knew her.’ Mr Steenkamp said he had never met Pistorius but his wife occasionally spoke to him on the phone.On the day of the killing, Ms Steenkamp had been due to give a talk to high school pupils ‘to empower them to be confident’. Her father said: ‘That’s what she was like, always wanting to help others.’ Shock: Pistorius appears in court charged with premeditated murder, but says he killed his girlfriend accidentally after mistaking her for an intruder at his home . Former girlfriends of the Paralympian have publicly suggested he has a dark side. One, 26-year-old student Samantha Taylor, said he is ‘certainly not what people think he is’. The Mail on Sunday has learned that Ms Taylor has been warned  to expect a subpoena, forcing her to give evidence at Pistorius’s trial. Ms Steenkamp appeared on a TV programme, Tropika Island of Treasure, in South Africa last night, which sees celebrities paired with contestants competing for a cash prize. Executive producer Samantha Moon claimed the programme had the backing of Reeva’s family. She said: ‘This is how they want to remember her.’ Reeva’s funeral will be on Tuesday, the same day Pistorius  is due in  court where it is understood lawyers will say the shooting was a tragic accident.","Athlete's best friend claims Pistorius called him moments after shooting .

"A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found inside a suitcase at a sports ground in London yesterday. The suitcase was discovered hidden among the trees surrounding the field by Thornfield Avenue, Mill Hill, north London, at around 5pm yesterday. Police were called to the scene and the area has been cordoned off. Crime scene: A woman has been found inside a suitcase in a wooded area near Thornfield Avenue, pictured, Mill Hill, North London . Detectives from the Homicide and Serious Crime Command are now investigating. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said a post-mortem examination will be arranged in due course. The woman, who has been described as a young adult, has not yet been identified. A police helicopter hovered overhead this afternoon as detectives combed the scene for clues. No arrests have been made. Murder Squad DCI Nicola Wall, speaking by the crime scene, said: 'We have worked throughout the night and we are working as hard as we can to find out who is in that suitcase and how they came to be there. Searching for evidence: Forensic investigators arrive at the crime scene where the body of a woman was discovered near playing fields in North London . 'We are in the early stages. There is a family out there and I don't want to give the wrong information and unnecessarily worry them.' Local residents said police arrived at the scene shortly after 5pm and sealed off the area around a footbridge which crosses a brook at the back of a row of 1930s suburban houses. But some told how they believe the body may have been there since Saturday. Diving instructor Richard Heraty, 44, walked alongside the brook with his two children, three and six, when he noticed what looked like clothing, or a blue tarpulin against a fence on Saturday afternoon. He said: 'It looked weird. It looked like clothing in the wooded area. It did not look too good. It's usually pretty tidy in there. I thought it might of been rubbish left by drinkers. Search: Police officers, pictured at the scene in north London today, worked through the night after the body was discovered yesterday afternoon . 'It looked like either clothes, a blue tarpaulin, or someone someone sleeping rough. 'I had my three-year-old and six-year-old on their bikes and was watching to make sure they didn't fall in the stream so I didn't look too closely.' Mr Heraty has lived in the area for 15 years and came forward after hearing on the news about the gruesome discovery. He added: 'It's quite disturbing. If someone has dumped something they have gone out of their way to dump it here. There are lots of dog walkers all day long. Its a lovely walk.' Resident Donna Pickup, 42, spoke of her shock as she and her family had walked through the strip of woods just an hour before the body was discovered. She said: 'It's awful. We saw police with sniffer dogs and quite a lot of police. It was all open when we walked through about 4pm. By five it was all closed off. Murder probe: Police have launched a murder investigation and ordered a post-mortem examination to be carried out to discover the cause of death . 'We could have walked past the poor woman without realising she was there. It's a big shock. There are lots of children and dog walkers who use the park. 'You don't expect this sort of thing to happen quite where you live.' One neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: 'I live across the road from the brook and footbridge. At about 5.30pm the police came and sealed off the area. They cordoned off the footbridge and then began searching along beside the brook. 'I asked one of the policemen what had happened and all he would tell me is that it was a crime scene and we wouldn't be allowed to go down there. 'I later found out that they had found the body of a woman. 'It must have been brought from somewhere else because this is a very quiet area. We get some kids down by the footbridge but they are not really any trouble - it must have been somebody else who brought it and dumped it.' Local residents believe the body may have been left in the woods since Saturday after walkers spotted what appeared to be clothing strewn about the area .","Suitcase found hidden among the .

"An American Airlines pilot was forced to make an emergency landing after a passenger refused to stop singing Whitney Houston's hit song I Will Always Love You. The solo performance began shortly into the flight from Los Angeles to New York and her crooning quickly became too much for passengers and staff on the domestic flight last Thursday. The pilot was forced to change course halfway through the six hour flight and make an unscheduled stop at Kansas City so officers could escort the woman from the plane. We have a Whitney Houston problem: Police officers board the American Airlines plane to escort a woman off a flight from LA to New York after she refused to stop singing I Will Always Love You . Arrested: The singer can just about be made out in a pink hat as police officers place her in handcuffs . Airport spokesman Joe McBride told WBTV: 'The woman was being disruptive and was removed from the plane for interfering with the flight crew. 'There was a federal air marshal on the aircraft, who subdued the woman and put her in cuffs and removed her from the plane.' Despite staff telling passengers they could not take photographs while on board the aircraft, one managed to briefly film the woman being escorted down the aircraft's aisle in handcuffs - still singing the 1990s pop song. The woman was interviewed and later released without charge. While the song she chose to entertain . her fellow passengers with is best known for Whitney Houston's cover in . the film The Bodyguard, it was originally released by country . singer-songwriter Dolly Parton in 1974. Too much of a good thing: Fellow passengers could no longer cope with her repeated renditions of the hit song from the film The Bodyguard . In the moment: The solo singer, picture din pink trousers with a green bag, is escorted down the aisle in handcuffs - still defiantly singer the 1990s pop song in this short video clip filmed by a fellow passenger . The original I Will Always Love You received positive comments from critics and reached number one on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart two times. This made Parton the first artist . ever to earn a number one record twice with the same song as a singer, . and three times as a writer. But . it was not until Houston's cover of I Will Always Love You in The . Bodyguard movie that the song became an international hit. The . Bodyguard's original soundtrack won the 1994 Grammy Award for Album of . the Year and I Will Always Love You became the best-selling single by a . female artist in music history. Houston . became the first act - solo or group, male or female - to sell more . than a million copies of an album within a single week period under . Nielsen SoundScan system. Popular: Singer Whitney Houston sang I Will Always Love You in the hit film The Bodyguard, pictured . Interruption: An American Airlines flight from LA to New York was forced to divert to make an emergency landing at Kansas City Airport so the Whitney Houston fan could be removed from the plane . The album makes her the top female act in the top 10 list of the best-selling albums of all time, at number four. Houston went on to star in more movies and contribute to their soundtracks but The Bodyguard and I Will Always Love You remained one of the biggest successes of her career. Houston was found dead in her guest room at The Beverly Hilton, in Beverly Hills, California, on February 11, 2012. The official coroner's report showed that she had accidentally drowned in the bathtub, with heart disease and cocaine use listed as contributing factors.

"A 64-year-old man finally looks like his identical twin after shifting five and a half stone in a year. Derek Hutchinson, from Fleet, Hampshire, can now be compared to his slim brother Philip, after almost 25 years of looking nothing like him. The shower service engineer put on weight after giving up smoking at 40 years old, and the weight continued to creep on. Slimmed down: Derek went to visit Philip and coincidentally turned up wearing an almost identical outfit to him. That was when they realised how similar they looked after his weightloss . But after a hip replacement in April 2012, Mr Hutchinson decided to lose weight to aid his recovery and joined his local Weight Watchers group run by team-leader Deborah Poxton. Mr Hutchinson said: 'I feel great and I wish I had done this years ago. 'I look like a twin again and people can recognise us as brothers. 'I went to visit Philip recently and his wife had never seen us looking similar. I had turned up wearing an almost identical outfit to him, so it was quite spooky. 'She couldn't believe it.' After starting his diet in June 2012 at a hefty 18 stone 1.5lbs, Mr Hutchinson adopted the Weight Watchers diet plan and started losing weight immediately. 'I knew I wanted to lose weight and a friend in the U.S was on a diet with Weight Watchers over there. She suggested I find my local group so we could diet together and compare notes online. Life-changing: Derek (right) gained weight when he gave up smoking 24 years ago. He began to look less and less like his brother but decided to shift the pounds when he had a hip replacement operation . 'I was a bit nervous as these diet groups are often dominated by women, so I thought it might be intimidating being the only man. 'A lot of the time I am the only man, but everyone is supportive and it's worked.' Mr Hutchinson who measured up at a 42-inch waist now boasts a slimmer 34-inch trouser size, and is just 5lbs from his weight target at 12 stone 5lbs. 'I was always a little bit chubbier than my brother growing up. Even when we were born I was a pound heavier despite being identical. 'But as children, and in our twenties and thirties people couldn't tell us apart, especially if we weren't together. 'But when I hit 40 I quit smoking and piled on the weight and we weren't recognised as twins anymore. All grown up: Identical twins Philip and Derek Hutchinson, aged nine months old at Christmas 1949 . 'Now I've lost it again Philip thinks it's great. I wish I had done this years ago.' Mr Hutchinson's weight loss plan consists of cutting down on fatty meat and eating lean meat and fish with plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables, with each food having a point value. 'I used to eat a lot of cheese and fatty meats such as pork and lamb, and sausages.' he admits. 'Now I eat lean meat, and have cut down on my alcohol consumption. I've also bought a bike and try to cycle 3 or 4 miles every day. 'I retire next year so I'm glad I have got fit in time to enjoy myself'. Weight loss leader Ms Poxton herself made headlines in June for her seven stone weight loss. The mother-of-six started up a weight loss group after losing a lot of the weight while her soldier husband Mark was serving in Afghanistan. She said he barely recognised her when he returned. She added: 'It's just amazing to see the photos of what Derek looked like before compared to what he looks like now, and he is happy which is great. 'He comes to every class which is rare for a man.'","Derek Hutchinson put on weight after giving up smoking at 40 years old .

"A hospital in Los Angeles has become the first in the world to live-tweet a brain surgery using Vine, Twitter's new way to share videos online. Incredibly the footage shows the patient happily strumming away on his guitar while doctors operate. Patient Brad Carter, 39, was filmed while surgeons placed a pacemaker implant in his brain yesterday to counteract the effects of Parkinson's disease. Not for the squeamish or faint-hearted, the tweets of the surgery are accompanied with video that shows each stage of the procedure in brief but graphic clips. Patient Brad Carter, 39, can be seen playing the guitar as surgeons at UCLA in California operate on his brain . Preparation: Brad Carter, who was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease in 2006, talks about the songs he plans to play ahead of surgery to implant a pacemaker in his brain . Mr Carter was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease after he developed hand tremors in 2006 which caused him to lose the ability to play his guitar. The operation involves stimulating an area of the brain and implanting a brain pacemaker to treat the condition and essential tremors. Mr Carter was woken up for part of the procedure and asked to play his guitar to assist the doctors with placing electrodes into the correct position. Pre-op: Doctors can be seen preparing Mr Carter for surgery in this picture uploaded to Twitter's Vine service . Getting started: UCLA tweeted this picture at the start of the operation next to the tag: 'Alright... here we go!' Doctors broadcast the procedure to . commemorate the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Centre's 500th deep brain . stimulation operation. In the incredible footage posted online, the . musician can then be seen playing his beloved instrument once again, . even singing along, as doctors finish placing electrodes in his brain. Speaking to the camera, Mr Carter says: 'I'm excited to play this guitar. [These are] original tunes - one is called ""Drunk again"".' The operation was filmed and live-tweeted to mark the 500th time the medical centre has performed the procedure. The hospital live-tweeted explanations, videos and photographs of the entire process to Twitter users over the course of several hours on Thursday . Live tweets using Instagram showed Twitter users the instruments and gadgets  - such as this remote control - being used to restore Brad's ability to play the guitar . Staff updated followers with Instagram photos and short video clips alongside the hashtag #UCLAORLive. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a therapy for sufferers of Parkinson's disease, a degenerative condition estimated to affect around 127,000 Britons. There is no cure for the condition but surgery such as this and medication can help alleviate symptoms including tremors, muscle stiffness, pain and very slow movement. DBS involves inserting a pacemaker that emits electronic impulses to affected areas of the brain, which lessens tremor symptoms. Here surgeons shows exactly how the procedure to implant a pacemaker was carried out to help control the patient's Parkinson's tremor . Anniversary: The operation was filmed to mark the 500th time UCLA has carried out the surgery . Awake: Mr Carter, who can be seen holding up a cup of water during the operation, was awakened during the surgery to assist doctors in placing the electrodes in the right place . At UCLA, the patient is kept . conscious throughout surgery and is asked to perform tests so that . surgeons can check the pacemaker is properly placed. UCLA said it live-tweeted the . surgery, which was overseen by Dr. Nader Pouratian, with the hope that . it would help alleviate future patients' fear of the procedure. Tweets posted included: 'Removing the skin and drilling through the skull for electrode placement' and 'Electrode is prepared for implantation. Patient is being woken up at this time'. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is the main type of surgery used to help alleviate the symptoms experienced when suffering with Parkinson’s. The procedure is not a cure, but it can give patients better control of slow movement, stiffness and tremors. It can also mean that the patients doesn’t need to take as much medication which in turn reduces the side-effects of strong drugs such as involuntary movement. The long-term outcome of deep brain stimulation is very encouraging. It is thought that it will remain the main surgical therapy for Parkinson's for the next 30 years. DBS involves inserting a pacemaker and leads that emit electronic impulses to the affected areas of the brain. The majority of people with Parkinson's who have had deep brain stimulation are fitted with a device that contains a non-rechargeable battery. On average, the battery lasts between 3 and 5 years depending on the stimulator settings, but some may last longer before a replacement is needed. The areas of the brain stimulated are usually the thalymus, the globus pallidus and the subthalmic nucleaus. A small electric current is sent through the leads to test how the person's symptoms respond to stimulation, to make sure they have been put in the right place. The leads are connected to extensions that are tunnelled under the skin behind the ear and down the neck. They are then connected to a neurostimulator (a pacemaker device), which is placed under the skin around the chest or stomach area. The patient is usually kept conscious throughout surgery and is asked to perform tests so that surgeons can check the pacemaker is properly placed. Once the wounds from surgery have healed, the device will be switched on and the electrodes will deliver high-frequency stimulation to the area of the brain that is targeted. It may take several months to fully programme the stimulator and adjust Parkinson's medication to get the most benefit from this treatment.","Musician Brad Carter, 39, was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 2006 .

"The extended family of a Houston girl who was the lone survivor of a shooting that killed her parents and four siblings have asked people to stop donating money after raising $400,000. Cassidy Stay, 15, survived July 9 by playing dead as her parents and four younger siblings — Bryan, 13, Emily, 9, Rebecca, 6, and Zach, 4 — were gunned down. Although wounded herself, she called police and identified the gunman as her aunt's ex-husband, Ronald Lee Haskell. Courageous: Cassidy Stay speaks during a community memorial in Spring, Texas . Cassidy's relatives posted a statement on the gofundme.com account that was set up by a family acquaintance and a Harris County constable who was among the first officers to reach the scene after the teenager's 911 call. The statement said: 'We have reached an amazing milestone on this fundraising site and wish to close it as we acknowledge our infinite appreciation to all who have contributed. 'The generosity of the local, state, national and even global community has humbled us beyond our ability to convey. 'At this time we hope everyone will continue to reach out to those in our various communities with the same care and love that has been shown to us.' Authorities said the family members were shot when they refused to divulge the whereabouts of Haskell's ex-wife. Haskell faces multiple capital murder charges for the deaths of Stephen Stay, 39, his wife, Katie Lyon Stay, 34, and their children. Cassidy Stay (centre) wipes her eye as she sits with her uncle Drew Lyon (left) while her grandfather Roger Lyon addresses a memorial service for members of the Stay family who were murdered in their home in Texas . Haskell had been divorced from Katie Stay's sister and records showed he had a history of domestic violence. Cassidy's relatives thanked those who have helped the teenager. They said: 'We will keep you all in our prayers and ask you keep us in yours as we go forward. Our faith and knowledge of Jesus Christ and His plan for all of us will heal all heartache. 'It is time for us as a family to develop a new routine, keeping our lost loved ones in our heart as we make a new path.' A family spokeswoman, Mary Flood, said the family didn't want to suggest where to send donations. 'People have been so generous and loving that they just think they've got to help somebody else', she said. Earlier this month, Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling wrote a heartfelt letter to Cassidy Stay. She had quoted part of a speech given by Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore in the third film of the popular series. Cassidy Stay, 15, is comforted by family members after the funeral service for members of the Stay family at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in Spring, Texas . Bravely speaking at a memorial just days after the July 9 attack, Cassidy had quoted the film, saying: 'Happiness can be found even in the darkest times, if one only remembers to turn on the light.' An online campaign to get J.K. Rowling to contact the teenager led to the world-famous author writing to Cassidy in the voice of Dumbledore. The handwritten note of comfort, written in purple ink, was accompanied by a wand, an acceptance letter to Harry Potter's school Hogwarts, a list of school supplies and a signed book. A spokesman for the 49-year-old author told the newspaper: 'We can confirm that J.K. Rowling was in touch with Cassidy Stay, however, the contents of the letter remain private.' Asked whether a meeting between the two may happen, she added: 'We wouldn't comment on that but [Cassidy's] is a remarkable story.' After quoting from the film The Prisoner Of Azkaban, Cassidy said: 'I know that my mom, dad, Bryan, Emily, Becca, and Zach are in a much better place and that I'll be able to see them again one day. Stay strong.' The line was spoken in the film by Harry Potter's mentor Dumbledore - played by Sir Michael Gambon - when he addressed students at the start of the film. The quote was credited to writer Steve Kloves, who transformed all seven books into screenplays.","Cassidy Stay, 15, survived the shooting in Spring, Texas, by playing dead .

"A series of stunning photographs capturing Nelson Mandela strength of character have been released. The pictures were taken in 2011 as part of film-maker Adrian Steirn’s celebration of South Africa, entitled ‘21 Icons’. The freedom fighter reduced the crew to tears with his stories and jokes, according to Steirn. Scroll down for video . Icon: Nelson Mandela sits for a portrait by photographer and filmmaker Adrian Steirn as part of the 21 Icons South Africa . He told The Times: ‘At one point I looked up and everyone was just crying. If you’re a South African, you’re connected to Mandela. He represents the human spirit.’ But, Mr Mandela did try and keep everyone in good spirits by cracking jokes. Steirn said that when he asked him if he could adjust the mirror, Mr Mandela replied ‘You can adjust the size of my face,’ causing the whole room to break down laughing. The 95-year-old is in a critical condition after being admitted to hospital on June 8 with a lung infection. South African President Jacob Zuma's office said that Mr Mandela is 'still in a critical condition in hospital but shows sustained improvement'. During the visit, he told the anti-apartheid leader of the love and support of all South Africans that was displayed at the leader's 95th birthday celebrations on July 18. The president also asked the nation to continue to keep Mr Mandela in its thoughts and prayers. Mr Mandela was jailed for 27 years in 1963 for his action against apartheid. Smile: Mr Mandela had everyone crying and laughing with his stories as he was filmed. The series celebrates the icons of post-apartheid South Africa . Filming: The photographs were taken at his home in Qunu, Eastern Cape as part of Steirn's 21 Icons South Africa series . He has said that he never believed he would get out of prison and had resigned himself to a life inside. Mr Mandela tells Steirn in one film: ‘I never thought I would come out. But one day they just said, Mandela, you can go home.’ The films aim to record people that have helped define the country since 1990, and also feature Archbishop of South Africa, Desmond Tutu. The pictures have been released as one of Mr Mandela’s oldest friends spoke out about his time with the man. QC Sir Bob Hepple plotted to overthrow the apartheid regime with Mr Mandela 50 years ago. He was arrested in a raid at Lilliesleaf Farm, where police found documents that ensured Mr Mandela’s eventual imprisonment for treason. Sir Bob said that Mr Mandela was forced to pretend to be his chauffeur, reported The Mirror. Poignant: Mr Mandela contemplates his reflection in a hand mirror. he was jailed for 27 years for his actions against apartheid . He said: You couldn’t have a white driver and a black passenger. So he would put on a cap and chauffeur’s coat and he would drive me. ‘At the time he loved a musical called King Kong which had just come out - which was about a black boxer and we would both sing songs from that.’ Sir Bob was forced into solitary confinement but made his way to Britain after testifying against his friends. He said that he never intended to do so, until Mr Mandela spoke to him: ‘He said to me you must make a personal decision. If he had said “whatever you do, don’t do it as it will give them political victory”, I am sure I would have turned them down. But I went ahead with it and was released.’ Mr Mandela and Sir Bob met again at a reception at Buckingham palace. When the freedom-fighter recognised his old friend, he embraced him.","New photos taken of Nelson Mandela show the icon's strength of character .

"The CFDA awards is one of fashion's most glittering affairs - and that was most certainly reflected in the dress code. Rihanna, Solange Knowles, Blake Lively and Naomi Campbell all championed sparkling metallics at last night's glamorous ceremony, organised by The Council of Fashion Designers of America. Rihanna, who was named 'Fashion Icon' at the awards, was undoubtedly the centre of attention at the New York event: the Diamonds singer stepped out in a daring, totally sheer embellished halter dress which showed off every inch of her slim figure. Scroll down for video . The ultimate golden girl: Rihanna, who scooped the fashion icon award at last night's CFDA awards, led the metallic trend in her blinging Adam Selman gown . The revealing outfit was custom-made by designer Adam Selman and comprised of a . total of 216,000 Swarovski crystals. The singer completed her look with a blinged-out Adam Selman headscarf and gloves. Another famous face to trial the metallic trend was Solange Knowles, who shimmered in a pewter Calvin Klein Collection gown, which she complemented with big hair and a bright pink lip. Blake Lively - fast becoming our number one style crush - stood out in a sea of floor-length gowns by going short and sweet in an abbreviated Sixties-style gold minidress from designer Michael Kors. Stylist Rachel Zoe wore a bespoke gold metallic dress, which she designed herself, while supermodel Naomi Campbell dazzled in a plunging floor-length metallic silver gown.

'They are glamorous, ooze screen goddess appeal and look great under the paparazzi flash-bulbs. 'Metallics rarely take a bad picture, that's because they are just so flattering to wear.

"Teenage girls who commit serious crimes will no longer be jailed under controversial plans to cut costs. The Youth Justice Board (YJB) is axing all prison places for girls and will instead house them in secure training centres. UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the move showed 'a deep lack of seriousness' in the Government's approach to tackling youth offending. Soft justice? Teenage girls who commit serious crimes will be sent to secure training centres instead of jail under Government plans to save money . He told The Daily Telegraph: 'The Government are trumpeting their changes to youth justice as a toughening of the system. It is obvious that is far from it. 'We should not be closing down capacity, if anything we should be sentencing more seriously and maybe even opening more.' A total of 41 places for girls will be closed at three prisons: Downview in Surrey, Eastwood Park in Gloucestershire and New Hall in west Yorkshire. More than 300 places for young men at two prisons - Wetherby, west Yorkshire and Hindley, Greater Manchester - will also scrapped. Phil Copple, the acting chief executive of the National Offender Management Service which runs prisons in England and Wales, said: 'The YJB make the decisions about which accommodation they need and have had to make difficult choices in the face of falling demand for places for young offenders and the need to reduce costs.' A total of 41 places for girls will be closed at three prisons: Downview in Surrey (above), Eastwood Park in Gloucestershire and New Hall in west Yorkshire . He said a redundancy scheme was being set up for staff who were losing their jobs. A National Offender Management Service spokesman said: 'The fall in the youth population has led to the Youth Justice Board’s decision to reduce the number of commissioned places for young offenders. 'The move of the remaining girls in the prison estate to secure training centres does not mean that they are being punished less severely. 'They will still be held securely, but will be held at the centres with a strong emphasis on their rehabilitation.' The changes come after the Ministry of Justice announced plans in January to build Britain’s biggest prison while closing five older ones in a bid to save millions of pounds. In addition to the new prison, which will hold 2,000 inmates, four so-called mini-jails will be opened, holding 250 inmates each. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling – who has adopted a tough stance on law and order – insists that, overall, not a single jail place will be lost. Mr Grayling’s predecessor, Kenneth Clarke, never recovered from allegations he was ‘soft on crime’ after closing prisons and reforming sentencing guidelines to reduce the number of people jailed. During his two years at the Ministry of Justice, Mr Clarke closed six prisons in order to save money.","Offenders will be sent to secure training centres .

"Hillary Clinton is stepping somewhere between meshuga and chutzpah with a lament in her new book about how Palestinians in Israel's West Bank are living 'under occupation.' In the memoir, due in stores on Tuesday, Clinton recounts a 1981 trip she took with her husband Bill between his nonconsecutive terms as governor of Arkansas. 'When we left the city and visited Jericho, in the West Bank,' she writes in her book Hard Choices, 'I got my first glimpse of life under occupation for Palestinians, who were denied the dignity and self-determination that Americans take for granted.' Those are fighting words for any U.S. politician who hopes to court American Jewish voters. The last elected official to make the same gaffe was Gov. Chris Christie, the constantly embattled New Jersey Republican. Dumb choices? 'Crossfire' co-host S.E. Cupp read aloud a passage from Hillary Clinton's new book on Monday, which describes the former secretary of state's feelings about Israel's alleged 'occupation' of Palestinian lands . Politically correct: Israel has built Jewish settlements on a little more than 1 per cent of the disputed West Bank territories, but it has become commonplace for politicians to refer to Tel Aviv as a wholesale 'occupier' of Palestinian lands . Christie recalled during a March 29 speech before the Republican Jewish Coalition that he had taken 'a helicopter ride from the occupied territories across' in 2012 'and just felt personally how extraordinary that was to understand, the military risk that Israel faces every day.' With the third-rail of Middle Eastern politics sparking, Christie made a hat-in-hand apology the following day to Sheldon Adelson, the über-wealthy conservative casino owner and serial campaign financier who had organizer the meeting. But Clinton isn't expected to follow suit. During a broadcast of CNN's 'Crossfire' program on Monday, a senior adviser to the Ready For Hillary political action committee, which is laying the groundwork for a 2016 presidential campaign, insisted that Clinton won't be falling on her sword. 'Does she owe Israel an apology for using the same language that Chris Christie used and then had to apologize to pro-Israel voters and pro-Israel groups?' asked S.E. Cupp, the conservative half of the show's left-right anchor desk. 'Hillary Clinton is going to stand by the words in her book,' said Tracy Sefl, the Clinton supporter. 'She is not going to apologize for something she need not apologize for.' Cupp wasn't impressed. 'Then you think that she believes that the Palestinian territory is ""occupied""?' Cupp asked. 'She's not going to apologize for that, and she asserted that on purpose?' 'I'm sure that when we all actually read the book and listen to her give these interviews, her words will stand for themselves,' Sefl shot back. 'She said it twice in the book,' chimed in Tim Miller, executive director of the conservative America Rising PAC. Miller co-authored an opposition-research-heavy book for his organization, and released it to coincide with Clinton's. The title: Failed Choices . Trump card: Clinton counts Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu among her public supporters, with Bibi saying in a 2012 tribute video that she 'is a strong and determined leader; she's principled and pragmatic' Co-host Paul Begala, a veteran strategist from Bill Clinton's White House days, insisted that the former first lady 'is very, very strong on' Israel. 'If that's the tree you guys want to bark up, I wish you luck,' he said. Cupp asked Sefl, 'Does (Hillary Clinton) owe Israel an apology for using the same language that Chris Christie used, then he had to apologize to pro-Israel voters and pro-Israel groups?” On Middle Eastern issues, Secretary of State Clinton painted a centrist self-portrait during her 2009-2013 time in office, and avoided clinging tightly either to Israel or to the Palestinian Authority. But on the thorny issue of West Bank settlements, she wore President Barack Obama's policy like a shield. In a May 2009 joint press conference with Egypt's foreign minister, she said the White House wanted 'to see a stop to settlements – not some settlements, not outposts, not natural growth exceptions. ... And we intend to press that point.' Palestinians living in West Bank cities like Hebron, Jericho and Nablus believe they have a sovereign claim to landlocked territories west of the Jordan river, saying that Israel is 'occupying' Palestinian lands. Israel's . position is that 'Palestine' hasn't existed as a geopolitical entity . since the British government ended its civil administration there in . 1948. At most, Tel Aviv says, the land is 'disputed,' not occupied. And that, Israel insists, means the land's status must be negotiated, not mandated at the barrel of a gun or handed over under threats from Hamas and other anti-Israel organizations that the U.S. sees as terror groups. Tracey Sefl, a senior advisor to the Ready For Hillary PAC, insisted that Clinton 'is not going to apologize for something she need not apologize for' Palestinians threw stones and burned tires on Friday as they clashed with Israeli security forces about Jewish 'occupation' of Palestinian-claimed  land in the West Bank . In 1948 the West Bank was declared part of Jordan, but that country relinquished control of it 40 years later, stripping West Bank Arabs of Jordanian citizenship. Israel has built settlements on just over 1 per cent of the West Bank and maintains civilian and military control of about 7 per cent of the territory overall. Armed clashes between Israeli soldiers and pro-Palestinian protesters are common in other areas of the West Bank where Israel and the Palestinian Authority share control. Clinton, Begala pointed out Monday, won praise from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a 2012 tribute video prepared for a public forum on Middle Eastern issues. 'I've just had the opportunity to work with her to achieve a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas,' Netanyahu says in the video. 'Hillary Clinton is a strong and determined leader, she's principled and pragmatic. ... As someone who knows a thing or two about political comebacks, I can tell you that I don't think we've heard the last of Hillary Clinton.' But the maybe-running Hillary's book has already become more of a liability than an asset, with news networks procuring advance copies and interviewers leaning on her for news. In one embarrassing interview with ABC News, she complained that she and President Clinton were 'dead broke' when they left the White House in 2000. Since then she has raked in $8 million in book earnings, and now charges $200,000 for public speeches.","Hillary Clinton writes that in 1981 when she visited Jericho, Palestinians 'were denied ... dignity and self-determination'

"A British jihadist fighting for ISIS in the Middle East has revealed he hopes to be given the opportunity to murder a Western hostage 'as a brother did with James Foley'. Speaking via video link from an unknown location likely to be somewhere in northern Syria, a man calling himself Abu Anwar Al-Brittani told CNN that he would be 'honoured' to become an executioner for ISIS, adding that he considered Foley's murder a 'blessed act'. Foley - an American photojournalist captured in Syria in 2012 - was filmed being  beheaded by an Islamist militant with a southern English accent in a sickening  video released last week. Scroll down for video . Anm ISIS fighter calling himself Abu Anwar Al-Brittani (right) told CNN that he considered James Foley's murder a 'blessed act'.

Execution: James Foley - an American photojournalist captured in Syria in 2012 - was filmed being beheaded by an Islamist militant with a southern English accent in a sickening video released last week (pictured) Video link: Speaking  to CNN's Atika Shubert (left) British militant Abu Anwar Al-Brittani (right on screen) said he would be 'more than honoured' to partake in an execution like that of American journalist James Foley . In a clear sign that footage of Foley's brutal death is being used to further radicalise jihadists fighting in Syria and Iraq, Abu Anwar said he now also hopes to be 'given the chance' to execute Westerners. Speaking exclusively to CNN's Atika Shubert, the British militant said: 'I would be more than honoured to partake in an execution like this. I hope God gives me the chance to do such a thing as the brother did with James Foley.' When asked who his desire to execute extended to, Abu Anwar replied: 'Whether it be on someone like James Foley, or a soldier of Bashar [al-Assad], or a soldier of America, my hands are ready to do this blessed act.' Abu Anwar is one of an estimated 500 British Muslims believed to have travelled to the Middle East to fight for ISIS - roughly the same amount currently enlisted in Britain's army. Abu Anwar appeared in the video alongside fellow British jihadist Abu Bakr al-Brittani.

Masked gunmen of the Islamic State group shoot seven men kneeling on the ground in front of them  in Raqqa province, Syria . In a chilling statement, Abu Bakr threatened to return to Britain and wage jihad there if he is ever unable to stay with ISIS, which rebranded as the Islamic State after declaring itself a Caliphate. Asked what would happen if the U.S. defeated the Islamic State, Abu Bakr said: 'If there’s no other chance than to come back…then I’ll have to do that…I’m ready to take that step to come back if your armies, if your countries don’t stop attacking us [ISIS].' When asked what he felt about the Muslim Council of Britain condemning Foley's murder, Abu Anwar told Shubert that he considers those working for the organisation traitors to the Islamic faith. 'The Muslim Council of Britain, they are apostates, they are not Muslims. They have always fought against Islam with the British government,' he said. 'They’ve tried to stop young men going to Afghanistan, Iraq, Sria and they work in these so-called anti-extremism projects. They are not Muslims,' he added.

CNN also spoke to the radical preacher Anjem Choudry, whose banned East London based group al-Muhajiroun has previously been called a 'gateway to terrorism' for many young British Muslims. Speaking with Nick Paton Walsh, Choudry and four of his current band of followers refused to condemn the brutal murder of Foley - with one simply making the bizarre statement that he would  rather have his own head cut off than be sent to U.S. prison Guantanamo Bay. Identifying himself only as Zakariyah, the  man said that Foley - who before his beheading was held hostage by militants for two years simply for  covering the Syrian conflict as a journalist  - would have had a greater understanding of his incarceration than the suspected terrorists at Guantanamo Bay.

"The hotly anticipated remake of Annie is one of five Sony movies being illegally shared online after a cyber attack allegedly committed by North Korea in revenge for a new Seth Rogen and James Franco comedy. The attack allegedly knocked out Sony Pictures Entertainment's entire computer network earlier this week, with staff reduced to working off white boards because their laptops and PC were rendered useless. The hack comes just under a month before Sony Pictures is due to release The Interview, which is a comedy about two journalists, played by Rogen and Franco, who are recruited by the CIA to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . The Interview: The movie, stars James Franco (left) as a host of a tabloid television show and Seth Rogan (right) as the show's producer. They are given a rare interview with the dictator but the CIA tries to turn them into killers . Leaked: The hotly-anticipated Annie remake backed by Jay Z has been released online after a 'cyber attack' The Pyongyang government denounced the film as 'undisguised sponsoring of terrorism, as well as an act of war' in a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in June. Representatives of the North Korean mission to the United Nations could not immediately be reached for comment about the cyber attack. In addition to Annie, starring Jamie Foxx, which is due to hit theaters on December 19, Brad Pitt's critically acclaimed World War Two movie, Fury, is also being openly traded and downloaded online. By Sunday morning, Fury, which is still playing in theaters, had been downloaded 1.2 million times and Annie had been downloaded 206,000 times from unique IP addresses, according to Variety. Other Sony movies being downloaded include 'Mr. Turner,' 'Still Alice' and 'To Write Love on Her Arms.' Sony Pictures' computer system went down on Monday. Before screens went dark, they displayed a red skull and the phrase 'Hacked By #GOP,' which reportedly stands for Guardians of Peace, the Los Angeles Times said. The hackers also warned they would release 'secrets' stolen from the Sony servers, the Times reported. According to one insider who spoke to industry website, TheWrap, 'Every PC in the company is useless and all of the content files have either been stolen or destroyed or locked away.' No demands have been issued by the hackers but a Reddit thread outlined the data allegedly mined by the Guardians of Peace. This includes A-list actors' passports, their bank details, salaries for film appearances, their password information and also email correspondences. According to the Reddit thread, the actors who have had their data compromised included Jonah Hill, Cameron Diaz and Angelina Jolie. Culprit? The company has accused the hermit kingdom of hacking into their system a month before the release of The Interview - a comedy film about two journalists who are recruited to assassinate Kim Jong Un  (pictured) Sony Pictures Entertainment is investigating to determine if hackers from North Korea were responsible for breaking into their server and shutting their computer system down .

A young star: Quvenzhané Wallis, who rocketed to fame in Beasts Of The Southern Wild, plays Annie . Also released: Brad Pitt's new movie Fury has been downloaded 880,000 times after the alleged attack . According to website Re/code, Sony and security consultants were investigating the possibility that someone acting on behalf of North Korea, possibly from China, was responsible for the hacking attack. Re/code said a link to North Korea had not been confirmed but it had not been ruled out. A source familiar with the matter told Reuters that Sony Pictures was investigating every possibility, adding no link to North Korea has been uncovered. Sony acknowledged the computer outage in a statement on Tuesday. Emails to Sony were bouncing back on Saturday with a message asking senders to contact employees by telephone because its email system was 'experiencing a disruption.' 'The Interview,' scheduled for release in the United States on December 25, stars James Franco as the host of a tabloid television show that is enjoyed by Kim, and Seth Rogen as the show's producer. When they are granted a rare interview with Kim, the CIA wants to turn them into assassins. KCNA, the official news agency in isolationist North Korea, quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesman in June as promising a 'merciless counter-measure' if the film is released. The government also wrote to U.S. President Barack Obama asking him to stop it, the Voice of America reported.","Annie remake and Brad Pitt movie Fury among five features leaked online .

"The nail salon business is booming in the U.S., with more of us indulging in regular claw-preening sessions than ever before, but have you ever wondered why so many of these salons are Vietnamese? NailedIt, a new documentary which tells the story of Vietnamese families who started off as refugees during the 1970s in America, reveals how they changed the face of the country's nail industry. As well as the surprising revelation that Hollywood Golden Age actress Tippi Hedren, now 84, played a key role in the industry's humble beginnings, NailedIt also explores current issues from race and discrimination to the toxic fumes faced by the Vietnamese nail technicians on a daily basis. Scroll down for video . Pros: NailedIt is a work-in-progress documentary which explores how Vietnamese refugees in the 1970s grew to dominate the nail salon industry in the U.S. (pictured, technicians featured in the film) Nail art: The documentary explores issues from race and discrimination to the toxic fumes faced by the Vietnamese nail technicians on a daily basis . 'NailedIt is about the impact the Vietnamese have had on this multi-billion dollar industry and the diverse culture of nails itself,' explains filmmaker Adele Pham, based in Brooklyn, New York, in the film's IndieGoGo trailer. It is a little-known fact that Tippi Hedren, a long-time philanthropist, unwittingly sparked the beginning of the industry in 1975, while aiding the thousands of Vietnamese refugees who had fled their country after the Fall of Saigon in 1975, to start new lives in the U.S. 'What we tried to do was help them assimilate,' she says. Ms Hedren saw a gap in the market amid the rich and glamorous Hollywood women she mixed with, and set about getting these refugees trained by her manicurist so they could open their own salons. Unlikely catalyst: Actress Tippi Hedren, pictured in her heyday (left) and appearing in NailedIt (right) sparked the industry in 1975, when she had a group of Vietnamese refugee women trained by her manicurist . History lesson: The talent spread and demand grew for skilled Vietnamese nail technicians, who now dominate almost half of the entire U.S. nail salon industry (pictured, Ms Hedren, back right and the refugees she trained) One of the reasons the industry took off for the mass-market in the way that it did, was the sudden abundance of skilled Vietnamese nail technicians, who made nail salons around the country more affordable. 'The film presents a long overdue cast of first and second generation Vietnamese, who redefined the stereotypical nail shop Asian' The fact that the job doesn't require workers to speak much English has also been cited as an advantage for workers, especially for the first generation of immigrants, who had never spoken another language. NailedIt also examines the occasional friction between Vietnamese-owned nail salons and African American customers, and explores some of the health concerns employees face, many related to the toxic fumes they are subjected to daily. 'The film presents a long overdue cast of first and second generation Vietnamese, who redefined the stereotypical nail shop Asian,' says Ms Pham, who is currently raising funds to complete the documentary.","Vietnamese-owned salons now dominate almost half of the entire U.S. industry .

"The National Security Agency has not denied spying on members of Congress after a senator demanded answers regarding its surveillance activities. The NSA released a statement on Saturday which did not deny collecting communications from legislators of the US Congress to whom it says it is accountable. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont sent a letter on January 3 asking about NSA ‘gathering metadata on calls made from official or personal phones, content from websites visited or emails sent, or collecting any other data from a third party not made available to the general public in the regular course of business’. Spying on us? Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont sent a letter on January 3 asking about NSA's surveillance activities on members of Congress . The agency said in its statement that the NSA’s gathering of ‘signals intelligence data include procedures that protect the privacy of US persons. Such protections are built into and cut across the entire process. ‘Members of Congress have the same privacy protections as all US persons. NSA is fully committed to transparency with Congress. 'Our interaction with Congress has been extensive both before and since the media disclosures began last June,' said the statement. It added: ‘We are reviewing Senator Sanders’s letter now, and we will continue to work to ensure that all members of Congress, including Senator Sanders, have information about NSA’s mission, authorities, and programs to fully inform the discharge of their duties.’ The agency has been at the centre of political controversy since former contractor, Edward Snowden, released thousands of revealing documents on its activities to media outlets. Former contractor, Edward Snowden, released thousands of revealing surveillance documents, hurling the NSA into the center of political controversy . Soon after Sanders' letter was published, the director of national intelligence, James Clapper, announced that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance (Fisa) Court, the body which exists to provide government oversight of NSA surveillance activities, had renewed the domestic phone records collection order for another 90 days, according to The Guardian. On Saturday, the New York Times published a letter from Robert Litt, in which the general counsel for the Office of National Intelligence denied allegations that Clapper lied to Congress in March, when questioned about NSA domestic surveillance.

Testimony: Robert Litt, the general counsel for the Office of National Intelligence, denied allegations that Clapper lied to Congress in March . Last month, two federal judges issued contradictory verdicts on whether such NSA surveillance was constitutional. Judge Richard Leon said it was not constitutional; Judge William Pauley said that it was, according to The Guardian. On Saturday Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) launched a class action lawsuit against the government over NSA spy programs. Paul claimed that several hundred thousand people have already signed up for the suit that he hopes will be reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court – perhaps an inevitability after courts have issued differing District Court rulings on the constitutionality of the program.","NSA released statement on Saturday .

"A generation of young people is being frozen out of the housing market and failing to put down roots, a report has found. It said soaring numbers of young workers are being forced to rent, giving them little stake in their neighbourhood and a reduced sense of community spirit. Their inability to get a foot on the housing ladder also means putting their career ambitions and family plans on hold. No stake: Generation of young people is being 'frozen out of the housing market' The analysis by the Institute for Public Policy Research found that 51 per cent of 18- to 30-year-olds believe they will not be able to buy a property for at least a decade. It also suggested that a renter needed to live in an area for 14 years to achieve the sense of belonging immediately conferred by owning a property. Dalia Ben-Galim of the IPPR said: ‘Insecure renting stops them from putting down roots, but it is also bad for society too. ‘Our analysis finds that home ownership has a big effect on people’s sense of belonging to their neighbourhood.’ The report recommends freeing more land for development, more home building and protecting tenants from rogue landlords. House prices are now 11 times the average salary compared with seven times in 2001. Figures from the housing charity Shelter show that three million young people aged 25 to 34 live with their parents – half a million more than in 1997. ‘Generation Rent’ is predicted to have grown by another half a million by 2020. Miss Ben-Galim added: ‘Our analysis shows that the lack of houses is dragging young people down. We found it is stopping many of them from building their careers and starting a family. ‘A huge majority of today’s younger generation want to own their home, just as most of their parents have done. But the prospect is slipping ever further over the horizon.’ A report has found soaring numbers of young workers are being forced to rent, giving them little stake in their neighbourhood . Around 100,000 young people are thought to be locked out of the property market every year, due to a lack of affordable housing, calls for large deposits and job insecurity. Rising house prices and the economic slump have changed the landscape for first-time buyers. In 1997, fewer than 10 per cent of first-time buyers under the age of 30 had help from family and friends, but by 2005 it was 45 per cent. The report acknowledges this was partially to do with ‘unsustainable’ mortgage lending. The IPPR report says: ‘It is not the case that the young people we spoke to want everything, with no sacrifice immediately. ‘They just want a chance to grow up, develop their lives, build careers and form relationships – and they need decent quality, affordable homes in which to do so.’","New report shows younger people are failing to get a foot on the housing ladder .

"Working excessive overtime without a single day off during the week, living together in crowded dormitories and standing so long that their legs swell and they can hardly walk after a 24-hour shift. These are the lives some employees claim they live at Apple’s manufacturing centres in China, where the firm’s suppliers allegedly wrongly dispose of hazardous waste and produce improper records. Almost 140 workers at a supplier in China were injured two years ago using a poisonous chemical to clean iPhone screens - and two explosions last year killed four people while injuring more than 75. Hard grafters: Workers inside a factory of Foxconn, an Apple manufacturing partner, in the township of Longhua in the southern Guangdong province. A New York Times investigation looked at the working conditions . Assembly: Employees of Hon Hai Precision Industry, an Apple producer, work along a production line in the Longhua Science and Technology Park, also known as Foxconn City, in Shenzhen, China . The California tech giant had allegedly been alerted to hazardous conditions inside the Chengdu plant in southwest China before the explosions at those plants, reported the New York Times. ‘If Apple was warned and didn’t act, that’s reprehensible,’ Massachusetts Institute of Technology work safety expert Nicholas Ashford told the New York Times. ‘But what’s morally repugnant in one country is accepted business practices in another, and companies take advantage of that,’ the former U.S. Labor Department advisor added. Banners in the Chengdu plant gave a warning to the 120,000 staff: ‘Work hard on the job today or work hard to find a job tomorrow’. Workers who arrived late often had to write confession letters. The newspaper’s report comes hot on the . heels of Apple announcing whopping $13billion profits on $46billion . sales in its last quarter - but the firm still wants its overseas . factories to produce more. At work: Apple executives claim the firm has improved its factories in recent years and issues a supplier code of conduct on labour and safety - but problems still exist, according to labour advocacy groups . Unpleasant sight: Nets to prevent workers from jumping to their deaths are pictured outside one of the Foxconn factory buildings in the township of Longhua, in southern Guangdong province . Apple executives claim it has improved . factories in recent years and issues a supplier code of conduct on . labour and safety - but problems still exist, according to employment advocacy groups. 'Work hard on the job today or work hard to find a job tomorrow' Banner in Chengdu plant . More than half of the suppliers audited by Apple have broken at least one part of its conduct code each year since 2007 and have even broken the law in some cases, according to company reports. A Foxconn employee jumped or fell from a block of flats after losing an iPhone prototype in 2009 - and 18 other workers apparently tried to commit suicide in two years, reported the New York Times. Suicide nets were installed to prevent workers from jumping to their deaths and Foxconn began providing better mental health treatment for its staff. Li Mingqi worked for Apple manufacturing partner Foxconn Technology until last spring and helped manage the Chengdu plant which had the explosion. He is now suing Foxconn over his dismissal. Impressive: Customers visit the Apple Store in New York City's Grand Central Station. Skyrocketing iPhone and iPad sales have helped Apple smash Wall Street expectations this week . iPad use: The report comes hot on the heels of Apple announcing whopping $13billion profits on $46billion sales in its last quarter - but the firm still wants its overseas factories to produce more . ‘Apple never cared about anything other than increasing product quality and decreasing production cost,’ Mr Li told the New York Times. ‘Workers’ welfare has nothing to do with their interests.’ 'What’s morally repugnant in one country is accepted business practices in another, and companies take advantage of that' Nicholas Ashford, work safety expert . The fatal Chengdu explosion came from an aluminium dust build up three weeks after the iPad came out. Despite Apple’s probe, seven months on there was a further, non-fatal, explosion in Shanghai. A former Apple executive claimed that the company has had knowledge of labour abuses in some factories for four years - ‘and they’re still going on because the system works for us’. Suppliers are only allowed the smallest margins on what they produce for Apple, and executives at the Cupertino company always ask them for details on part costs, worker numbers and salary sizes. But workers at a factory of Apple partner Wintek went on strike after rumours that employees were exposed to toxins because they evaporated three times faster than alcohol when rubbing screens. Treatment: A victim injured by an explosion at a Foxconn factory in May arrives at a hospital in Chengdu . Panic: Smoke rises as police and onlookers stand near at a Foxconn factory in Chengdu, China, last May . Apple’s late co-founder Steve Jobs, who died last October, said two years ago that Apple is a worldwide leader in ‘understanding the working conditions in our supply chain’. 'We’re trying really hard to make things better. But most people would still be really disturbed if they saw where their iPhone comes from' Former Apple executive . He said many of the factories have restaurants, cinemas, hospitals and swimming pools. While staff say they appreciate these facilities, the working conditions are still seen as relentless. Foxconn said conditions are ‘anything but harsh’, just one in 20 workers assembly line workers must stand to do their jobs and the firm has a ‘very good safety record’, reported the New York Times. But the Mail on Sunday visited a Foxconn factory making iPods in Shenzhen, China, in 2006, and our reports on long hours, crowded accommodation and punishments shocked Apple executives. ‘We’re trying really hard to make things better,’ one former Apple executive told the New York Times. ‘But most people would still be really disturbed if they saw where their iPhone comes from.’","'Working excessive overtime without a single day off during the week'

Picking up speed: The duo head outside to start a real sprint, and the proper exercise begins . Follow the leader: Biden lags behind his Commander-in-Chief . The President replies 'Let's do this', . and the two begin a run around the White House, followed by stretching . and drinking a large glass of water each. They then promise each other 'same time next week' before heading back to work. As Biden catches up, the two begin a more leisurely pace, more jogging than running full clip . Warm down: The pair stretch, so that they can avoid cramps and muscle aches later in the day . You win: Biden concedes that Obama had him pegged during their mid afternoon run . Time to hydrate: The two stress the importance of refuelling after exercise with some conveniently placed presidential glasses . President Obama promises to tell the Vice President's wife that he drank all of the water, so he doesn't get in trouble . Back to work: President Obama, satisfied with his day's workout, heads back to important democratic business in his White House office . The . Let's Move campaign was started in 2010 by First lady Michelle Obama, . as a campaign to fight childhood and adult obesity, as well as improve . the general health of the U.S. population. The scheme focuses on plans of diet and exercise, promoting healthy eating and regular physical activity. It . also provides step-by-step plans for those aiming to join in with the . campaign, and regularly enlists the help of celebrities. First lady Michelle Obama talks to the kids after they exercised and danced with the Super Sprowtz during a visit to La Petite Academy in Bowie, Maryland . First lady Michelle Obama exercises and dances with trainer Roger Hanson (left), and an anthropomorphic aubergine (right) The First lady's scheme has been running for four years, and celebrated it's fourth anniversary on a popular national talk show . Recently . Michelle Obama joined up with actor and comedian Will Ferrel to get . fans to learn the facts about obesity and how they can fight it. The scheme is part of a White House initiative on fighting the condition, hoping to 'bring the U.S. to a much more healthier norm'. The appearance of Mr Biden and Mr Obama in the video together is another suggestion that their relationship is back on track. In a revealing interview with Politico, Mr Biden, 71, said his boss assigned him 'every s*** job in the world' and was effectively frozen out after announcing his approval of gay marriage before the President. ‘When the president asked me what portfolio did I want, I said, “Base it on what you want of me to help you govern…But I want to be the last guy in the room on every major decision… You’re president, I’m not, but if it’s my experience you’re lookin’ for, I want to be the last guy to make the case,”’ Biden said in a lengthy Politico profile.He went on to admit that Obama kept up his end of the bargain for the majority of their dealings, but the article reveals that there has been a definite frost between the two men that has only just begun to thaw now after the 2012 incident.","Obama and Biden ran, stretched and hydrated in the video .

"The world's first motorised lawnmower has been restored to its former glory more than a century after being invented as the ultimate rich man's toy - costing the equivalent of £15,000 today. Andrew Hall, 54, a gardener from Ilminster, Somerset, spent four years working on the 1.25 ton machine that was the forerunner of suburban lawns across the world today. The Ransome driveable mower cost £137 in 1902 - equivalent to £15,000 today - and was a 20th Century alternative to horse-driven and steam-powered mowers. Enthusiast: Andrew Hall from Somerset spent four years working on the 1.25 ton machine . The machine at work in Bournville: The 8ft long mower was initially purchased by Cadbury's . Because only the rich could afford them at first they were driven by chauffeurs who were given the task of tending to their master’s lawns. The 8ft long machine, that is about the same size as a Mini, was initially purchased by Cadbury’s and used in the Bournville village in Warwickshire to maintain a sports field. It was then bought second-hand by Peugeot Talbot in 1923 to mow their sports field in Coventry. However, when the motoring firm extended their pavilion they built a new structure over the top of the machine, totally encasing it. It lay forgotten for more than 50 years until the building was demolished. Historic: The Ransome driveable mower cost £137 in 1902 - equivalent to £15,000 pounds today . Mr Hall had to build a new side frame and a grass box assembly to restore the machine . Luckily, the main frame, body, rollers, cutting cylindar blades and 1906 3hp engine were still intac . Mower enthusiast Mr Hall was then given the machine which he has painstakingly restored. Luckily, the main frame, body, rollers, cutting cylindar blades and 1906 3hp engine were still intact. Mr Hall had to build a new side frame and a grass box assembly and had to locate and replace the chains which run down one side. Mr Hall, 54, a gardener, said: 'As collectors you are always having to look for rare items or what people haven’t heard of. Mr Hall said the machine runs a bit slower than a modern lawn mower and it is loud like tractor . 'When I first saw the mower it looked a bit forlorn, someone had gone at it with a sledge hammer and there was nothing in front of the cutting cylinder. 'After I was given it I realised it was the first one that Ransom’s made when I spotted the identification number. 'It has taken four years to restore it and I would say it was 60 per cent intact, and I had to build some new parts. 'It was a mammoth job and a real labour of love. The 1902 Ransome is a historic survivor from the Edwardian age when chauffeurs were given the task of grooming their masters lawns . It took Mr Hall four years to rebuild and source the parts of the world's first motorised lawnmower . The mower now forms part of Mr Hall's mammoth collection of 1,200 machines . 'It took so long because of the rebuilding and sourcing of parts and putting it all together. 'One of the things I had to do was find a magneto and carberetta. 'I used a stop valve from a central heating system in a block of flats in London as a wheel for adjusting the height of the cutting cylinder. 'It runs a bit slower than a modern lawn mower, I would say it is about walking pace. One of the things Mr Hall had to do to restore the mower was find a magneto and carberetta . Andrew Hall, 54, a gardener from Ilminster, Somerset, spent four years working on the 1.25 ton machine . 'When the engine is running everybody knows about it because it is very loud like a traction engine. 'There aren’t any brakes on it because it was just designed for use on flat ground. 'There’s a wheel and what you do is turn it one way or the other and somewhere in the middle there is a neutral position. 'But there aren’t any gears and to stop you have to turn it off.' The mower now forms part of Mr Hall's mammoth collection of 1,200 machines housed in a large shed at his home.","Andrew Hall, 54, from Somerset, spent four years working on the mower .

"They might be famous for their buttoned-up approach to romance and reluctance to express their true feelings but it seems that British women are naughtier than previously thought. A new survey has found that almost 70 per cent of British women like to experiment in the bedroom, with popular diversions including sex toys, doing the deed in public and using food to make time between the sheets more memorable. Sexual behaviour was also found to vary across the UK, with those living in the south-east most open to experimenting while women based in the East Midlands were most likely to keep details of their exploits under wraps. What's your fantasy? More than 70 per cent of British women have admitted to experimenting in the bedroom . 73 per cent of women living in the south-east said they had experimented with bondage, role play and even threesomes - five per cent above the national average. Those living in the West Midlands were the busiest between the bed covers, while those in East Anglia were the least likely to try something new with just under half saying that they always did the same thing. Welsh women, meanwhile, were found to be the most comfortable with discussing their bedroom exploits with friends, unlike discreet north-easterners who were found to be the most keen to keep their time between the sheets between them and their partner. Although the Welsh were more likely to reveal all, the majority of British women do live up to the national stereotype in one respect with 67 per cent saying they were reluctant to talk to their partner about sex. Britain's bedroom secrets revealed: Are you a Bond-loving Scot or a garrulous Welsh woman? And despite the best efforts of erotic novellists such as E.L James, it seems the missionary position is still the nation's favourite, with just over a third saying they preferred it to any other. Less surprisingly, the survey, which . compared women's real sex lives to their fantasy ones, also found that . the younger generation were most likely to be adventurous while the . over-55's tended to be the most conservative. Equally . unsurprising was the finding that George Clooney was the majority of . British women's dream sexual partner, although in Scotland, the American . silver fox was pipped to the post by the rugged Hugh Jackman. Mr . Darcy proved to be the favourite fictional hero,  although Scottish . women once again bucked the trend, plumping for James Bond instead. Popular: Hugh Jackman and George Clooney appear in more sexual fantasies than any other A-list men . Whether with Darcy or Clooney, nearly half of the 2,000 . women questioned (45 per cent) admitted that they fantasise about sex . more than they actually have sex, with the dream sexual scenarios revealed to be dominance and submission role plays, sex with a fireman or . sex on a beach. These . findings suggest that despite the Fifty Shades phenomenon, as well as . the surge in explicit television shows such as Channel 4’s Sex Box, British women still prefer to cultivate an air of mystery around their real and . fantasy sex lives. A spokesperson for Totally Bound, the erotic publisher which conducted the survey, said: 'We’ve conducted . extensive research to thoroughly understand what UK women want when it . comes to real and imagined sex. 'We discovered that there’s a real . appetite for provocative and well-written stories about sex, love, . empowerment and relationships. BUSIEST IN THE BEDROOM: THE WEST MIDLANDS . More than half of women in the West Midlands (58 per cent) say they have sex at least once a week, making them Britain's busiest in the bedroom. Women in this region also frequently fantasise about sex, with 15 per cent admitting to having daily fantasies - just above the . national average of 13 per cent. Their ultimate sexy scenarios are . dominance and submission role plays, sex with a fireman or sex on a . beach.MOST LIKELY TO EXPERIMENT: THE SOUTH EAST . The . nation’s naughtiest women reside in the South East with 73 per cent . having tried everything from bondage to threesomes, more than anywhere . else in the country and five per cent above the national . average. At the top of the list of sexploits was using toys (51 per cent), . closely followed by having sex in public (40 per cent) and bringing food into . the bedroom (35 per cent).MOST LIKELY TO SHARE FANTASIES WITH FRIENDS: THE SOUTH WEST . Although the majority of British women prefer to discuss sexual matters directly with their partner, those based in Devon, Cornwall and Dorset were most likely to reveal their fantasies to their girlfriends instead. 33 per cent . said they were more likely to trust their friends with the intimate details of their sexual fantasies - the highest percentage . in the country and six per cent above the national average.  MOST LIKELY TO SWAP MR DARCY FOR JAMES BOND: SCOTLAND . To no-one's great surprise (least of all Colin Firth), the nation’s favourite fictional hero is the . quintessentially British Mr Darcy. But not in Scotland, where women prefer a more daring man in the shape of James Bond, currently played by Daniel Craig. Scottish women also chose to go their own way when asked to pick their ideal A-list date, with the majority plumping for Hugh Jackman instead of the national favourite, George Clooney. MOST LIKELY TO EXPERIMENT IN SECRET: THE EAST MIDLANDS . Women . in the East Midlands are more adventurous than you think but you would . never know it because they are the most reluctant to divulge details of . their secret sex lives. 72 per cent of women have experimented . with adventurous sex activities but 87 per cent of these would . rather keep it a secret. Top sexy activities included using sex toys, bringing food into the bedroom, having sex in . public, bondage and role play. MOST LIKELY TO REVEAL BEDROOM SECRETS: WALESThere’s . no holding back in Wales - women from this region are the most . comfortable discussing their secret sex lives. 31 per cent would share . details of their sexploits, compared to the national average of just 23 . per cent. And when Welsh women aren't talking about sex, they’re fantasising about it, . with 64 per cent having sexual fantasies once a week or more - five per cent . more than women from the rest of the UK. MOST LIKELY TO KEEP IT SIMPLE: EAST ANGLIAWomen . in East Anglia revealed themselves to be the coyest when it comes to . sex, with almost half (43 per cent) saying they hadn’t experimented with . their partner - more than 10 per cent below the national average. 36 per cent of respondents said they won't even . discuss their sex lives with their partner, although that doesn't prevent them from fantasising about it - 59 per cent said they fantasise . about sex once a week or more.  MOST LIKELY TO  KEEP BEDROOM EXPLOITS A SECRET: THE NORTH EAST . Forget . discussing undercover sex lives, for those in Newcastle, Durham, Sunderland and the rest of the North East, talking . about regular sex habits is considered taboo. Despite . being one of the most sexually active regions with 56 per cent of women . having sex once a week or more, the North East is the UK’s region most . reluctant to discuss their daily sex lives. 38 per cent won’t share the . details of their regular sex lives with anyone - well above the national . average of 30 per cent.","73 per cent of women in the south-east experiment between the sheets .

"Habitable Earth-like planets could be in our own back yard - in astronomical terms, that is. Researchers have identified three planets, which are between 300 and 600 light years away, as 'objects of interest' - meaning they could be potentially habitable. But the closest of these potentially habitable planets is just 13 light years away. They orbit red dwarf stars, and the Harvard university team say their findings show up that six per cent of these stars could have similar planets. Planets that we could live on orbit red dwarf stars such as Gliese 581 . The closest red dwarf stars - and their planets, which we could potentialy inhabit - are in our astronomical backyard of just 13 light years' distance. And since red dwarf stars live much longer than Sun-like stars, any life on such a planet could be much older and more evolved than on Earth. Harvard astronomer and lead author Courtney Dressing, who presented the findings at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, said: 'We thought we would have to search vast distances to find an Earth-like planet. 'Now we realise another Earth is probably in our own backyard, waiting to be spotted.' New world: This artist's conception provided by the Harvard-Smithsonian Center shows a hypothetical planet with two moons orbiting in the habitable zone of a red dwarf star. Earth-like worlds may be closer and more plentiful than previously imagined . She added: 'You don't need an Earth clone to have life.' A red dwarf is a small and relatively cool and low-mass star. There are several factors which may make life difficult on planets around a red dwarf star. Planets in the habitable zone of a red dwarf would be so close to the parent star that they would likely be tidally locked, meaning that one side would be in perpetual daylight and the other in eternal night. The perpetual night zone would be cold enough to freeze the main gases of their atmospheres, leaving the daylight zone nude and dry. On the other hand, recent theories propose that either a thick atmosphere or planetary ocean could potentially circulate heat around such a planet, or life could survive by migration. Alternatively, a moon in orbit around a gas giant planet may be habitable. She identified the planets by studying transits - when a planet passes in front of a star. The signal of a transiting planet is larger since the star itself is smaller, so an Earth-sized world blocks more of the star's disc. Researchers identified around 158,000 of the possible 75 billion red dwarf stars that make up the galaxy, discovering many were smaller and cooler than first thought. Of that number around 95 planetary candidates orbiting red dwarf stars were considered possibilities, though all but three were neither cool nor smaller enough to be considered Earth-like. The three considered habitable - named Kepler Objects of Interest, were both warm and approximately Earth-sized, according to the findings. One was slightly smaller than earth while the other two were bigger. They each had a smaller orbit than earth of between 20 and 56 days and are around 300-600 light-years away. Closer to home, it is thought that no other planets in our own solar system could support human life, forcing us to look further afield .","Harvard scientists have identified three planets as 'objects of interest'

"Client: Brian Meehan, 56, a low-level personal injury lawyer from Philadelphia , has been charged with indecent sexual assault and patronizing a 14-year-old prostitute . A Philadelphia personal injury lawyer has surrendered to authorities on charges that he had sex with a 14-year-old sex slave a dozen times, including at work in his downtown office. District Attorney Seth Williams announced Tuesday that 56-year-old  Brian Meehan is accused of being a client of a sex trafficking ring in a case spanning from Pennsylvania to Georgia. The girl was held captive just blocks from her Philadelphia home in March 2012 and sometimes hired out 20 times a week, Williams said at a press conference. 'There is a special place in hell for people like Brian Meehan,' the district attorney told reporters Tuesday. She was 'sold' a month later to another pimp in Camden, New Jersey, for $300 before she turned up in Georgia that summer as a potential sex trafficking victim, a grand jury report said. The girl has since told Philadelphia police that she remembered being taken to a law firm near City Hall several times, where a lawyer named Brian Meehan paid to have sex with her, according to the report. The teen remembered the layout of the high-rise office at One Penn Plaza and described security guards she saw in the lobby. She believed Meehan, a name partner at the personal injury frim Bishop Dorfman Lazaroff Meehan, PC, knew how young she was, but nonetheless paid her for sex and offered her alcohol while her handler waited outside, the report alleges. The teenager detailed her encounters with Meehan, saying that the middle-aged man had both vaginal and oral intercourse with her on multiple occasions. She also testified that Meehan, who is married with a grown daughter, told her he liked younger girls, and that the youngest girl he had sex with was 12 years old. Meehan, a low-profile personal injury and criminal defense lawyer, turned himself in hours before the charges were announced. He faces multiple counts of indecent sexual assault, patronizing an underage prostitute and other offenses. Workplace trysts: Meehan allegedly had a dozen encounters with the sex trafficking victim, including during work hours in his downtown office (pictured) 'At this point, we're not privy to any of the facts that the DA alleges in the indictment because of the nature of the grand jury process, but my client maintains his innocence,' defense lawyer Fortunato Perri Jr. said. Investigators found DNA evidence during a recent search of the conference room at Meehan's law firm, the grand jury report said. Meehan had previously represented the girl's alleged captors, Williams said. They have been charged and are in custody, but their names were not released because the grand jury has not yet finished its work on the case. One of the alleged captors had seen the girl hanging around a high school in their Germantown neighborhood, and introduced her to a woman identified only as 'S.F,' the report said. 'S.F.' and her boyfriend, 'R.H.,' held the girl and four other females — some of them minors — at the house. Family man: The 56-year-old attorney is married and lives with his wife, Susan (pictured right), in Berwyn . Sex slave: The young sex worker, who was allegedly victimized by Meehan (pictured center) was at one point sold for $300 to a man from New Jersey . 'They would beat her and threaten to kill her if she would try to leave,' Williams said. The girl's family had reported her missing. She turned up at a New Jersey hospital in April to get help for severe vaginal pain and told a nurse about her plight, the report said. But she gave a false name and disappeared before authorities arrived. However, she had listed her captor's address, which led police to interview the couple. They acknowledged that the girl had stayed there 'in exchange for the victim having sex with men for money,' the report said. The FBI has also been involved in the case. Four others identified as victims of the couple have all been freed. Williams and his deputies declined to say if Meehan's victim — now 16 — has been reunited with her family. Meehan's now-former partners said in a statement to MailOnline Wednesday that the lawyer, who has been practicing law since 1987, was fired as soon as the allegations against him came to light. 'We are shocked and appalled and moved swiftly to terminate Mr. Meehan as soon as we were made aware of this matter,' a spokesman for the firm wrote. 'Our thoughts are with the victims and we will continue to do everything we can to cooperate with the investigation.'","Brian Meehan, a low-level personal injury lawyer from Philadelphia, charged with indecent sexual assault and patronizing underage prostitute .

"Jailed: Last week, Ghoncheh Ghavami, from West London, was sentenced to a year in prison . The Foreign Office has been ridiculed after it claimed that data protection rules meant it could not tell the family of a British woman jailed in Iran what is being done to secure her release – because it first needed her permission. Ghoncheh Ghavami, 25, was arrested on June 20 after attempting to watch a men’s volleyball game with a group of about 40 women protesters in the Iranian capital Tehran. Iran banned women from volleyball matches in 2012, claiming that they need protection from the lewd behaviour of male fans. Last week, the law graduate, from Shepherd’s Bush, West London, was sentenced to a year in prison after being found guilty of ‘propagating against the ruling system’. Before her sentencing, her brother Iman Ghavami contacted the family’s MP, Andy Slaughter, begging for help, and on October 3 the Labour MP wrote to the Foreign Office asking it to look urgently into the case. Three weeks later, he received a response from Junior Minister Tobias Ellwood, who is responsible for constitutional matters in the Middle East, saying the department was taking the case ‘extremely seriously’. But the Tory MP for Bournemouth East added: ‘You will understand that due to our obligations under the Data Protection Act I cannot go into detail of Ms Ghavami’s case without her express permission. ‘Once we have received this, my officials will keep you informed by forwarding updates.’ However, the Foreign Office has since been forced to back down from its initial response. A letter to Mr Slaughter from Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said: ‘The Foreign Office takes its responsibilities under the Data Protection Act very seriously. However, I accept that, in the circumstances, you could not reasonably be expected to obtain authorisation from Ms Ghavami.’ Mr Hammond added that the matter was complicated further because the UK does not have an embassy in Iran and the country does not recognise Ms Ghavami – who has a UK and Iranian passport – as a British citizen. Mr Slaughter said: ‘I was dismayed at the initial farcical letter from the Foreign Office but I now hope that together we can all do our utmost to bring Ghoncheh back home. ‘Most Mail on Sunday readers will find it hard to believe that a young woman – a British citizen – could be locked up for months in a foreign prison simply for wanting to attend a volleyball match. ‘But that is the shocking situation facing one of my constituents. Ghoncheh is a promising law graduate whose bright future in now in jeopardy as she suffers in an Iranian prison for something that us Britons would take for granted. Protest: Ms Ghavami, circled, was arrested on June 20 after attempting to watch a men’s volleyball game with a group of about 40 women protesters in the Iranian capital Tehran . ‘It is a testament to the key British value of tolerance that her case has caused such outrage over here. A petition calling for her release could soon reach one million signatures. ‘The matter is all the more urgent due to reports that she has been sentenced to one year in prison and is currently on hunger strike.’ There has been widespread outrage across the world over Miss Ghavami’s imprisonment. She was first detained by the morality police outside Tehran’s Azadi Stadium with around 40 other protesters after attempting to watch Iran take on Italy. She was released shortly afterwards and wrote a blistering attack on the extremist state, courageously publishing it under her own name on Facebook. She was then rearrested ten days later after returning to a police station to collect her belongings. More than 700,000 people have so far signed an online petition by Amnesty International urging Iran’s theocratic regime to release her.","Ghoncheh Ghavami was arrested after attempting to watch men's game .

"Boko Haram has seized the northeastern Nigerian town from which it abducted 276 schoolgirls  more than six months ago and declared the town part of their 'caliphate'. Heavily-armed extremists loyal to the Islamist terror group swept into Chibok yesterday afternoon, obliterating communication masts with rocket-propelled grenades and forcing terrified residents to flee their homes. The attack comes after the April 14 kidnapping in the impoverished town, in southern Borno state, brought unprecedented global attention to the armed Islamist group's brutal five-year uprising. Heads of state and top celebrities joined a viral social media campaign calling for the rescue of the seized, mostly Christian, schoolgirls, 219 of whom are still being held. Scroll down for video . Rampant: A new Boko Haram video shows jihadist fighters parading on a tank in an unidentified town in northern Nigeria . Walking through: Boko Haram fighters parade on a tank in an unidentified Nigerian town. Violence in the northeast has intensified since, with Boko Haram reportedly seizing more than two dozens towns and Nigeria's security forces reportedly absent in many areas . Significant: Given Chibok's symbolic significance, its fall will likely raise fresh doubt about Nigeria's ability to handle the Boko Haram threat . Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan has repeatedly promised to rescue the schoolgirls, including on Tuesday when he launched his bid for a second term in office ahead of February 14 polls. In a July meeting in the capital Abuja with those affected by the kidnapping, Jonathan and top military brass also pledged to provide better security for the town. But nevertheless, the violence in the northeast has intensified since, with Boko Haram running rampant across the country's northeast, reportedly seizing more than two dozens towns and Nigeria's security forces reportedly absent in many areas. The military was not immediately available to comment on the developments in Chibok. But given the town's symbolic significance, its fall will likely raise fresh doubt about Nigeria's ability to handle the Boko Haram threat. 'Chibok was taken by Boko Haram. They are in control,' said Enoch Mark, a Christian pastor whose daughter and niece are among the hostages being held. Mark and the senator for southern Borno, Ali Ndume, said the militants attacked at about 4pm  on Thursday, destroying communications masts and forcing residents to flee. No ceasefire: The leader of Boko Haram, Abubakar Shekau, was filmed preaching to locals in an unidentified town. In the speech, he again dismisses government claims about ceasefire talks and threatens to kill the man who has presented himself as Boko Harams negotiator . Rampage: Boko Haram have kidnapped hundreds of people from villages across Nigeria's Borno State . Ndume said that he had received calls from fleeing residents about the attack that the town 'was now under their (Boko Haram) control'. 'There is no telephone service now in Chibok, which is why it took time before the reports reached me,' he added. Mark said the attack on the town appeared to come after Boko Haram overran the towns of Hong and Gombi in neighbouring Adamawa state following the group's ouster from the commercial hub of Mubi. 'They came in and engaged soldiers and vigilantes in a gunfight,' he added. 'Some of us managed to escape. All the telecom towers in the town were destroyed during the attack with RPGs (rocket-propelled grenades). 'No-one can say what the situation is in the town in terms of destruction to property.' At the July meeting with Jonathan, Chibok community leaders stressed that aside from the trauma of the mass kidnapping, locals remained in daily fear of attack and pleaded for more security. Terror: Nigeria's government vowed to secure the region after the mass abduction by the terror group of 276 girls (pictured) more than six months ago . Ayuba Chibok, whose niece is among the hostages, said at the time that people told the head of state that they 'were tired of sleeping in the bushes'. In a series of phone calls to AFP in recent months, Chibok elders stressed that security had continued to deteriorate, despite the promises made at the meeting. A senior rescue worker warned late last month that Chibok's fall was imminent. Pogo Bitrus, chairman of the elders forum in Chibok, also confirmed the attack but said Boko Haram may have had inside information about security in the town. 'The vigilantes use shotguns and cartridges and have been short in supply, so the leader left yesterday for Maiduguri to procure more in the event of any attack,' he said by telephone from Abuja. 'But Boko Haram launched the attack while he was still in Maiduguri. He was due to come today, so it looks like they knew what was happening.' Bitrus said the vigilantes were preparing for a counter-attack and troops had been deployed from Damboa, 36.5 kilometres (22.5 miles) away by road to the northwest. 'I can assure you they are going to retake Chibok,' he added.","Nigerian terror group Boko Haram overran Chibok yesterday at around 4pm .

"Scotland Yard was last night facing demands to say if it has a copy of a missing dossier containing explosive claims of a Westminster paedophile ring. Campaigning MP Simon Danczuk called on the Metropolitan Police to reveal what information is in its hands after The Mail on Sunday was given the first indication that the bombshell file had been found. A Freedom of Information response about the documents – believed to name up to eight public figures involved in child sex abuse but lost or shredded by the Home Office – confirmed ‘the requested information is held’ by Britain’s biggest force. But the Yard has refused to set out exactly what information it has found – even though a fresh search is under way in Home Office archives for the missing files compiled by the late Tory MP Geoffrey Dickens. Scotland Yard has refused to set out exactly what information it has found – even though a fresh search is under way in Home Office archives for the missing files compiled by the late Tory MP Geoffrey Dickens (above) Last night Scotland Yard was told to come clean about what it has – or risk fresh accusations of a cover-up. Mr Danczuk , the Labour MP for Rochdale who has helped uncover allegations of a Westminster abuse scandal including the scale of offending by the late Cyril Smith, said: ‘The Met need to confirm or deny whether they hold what they believe to be the Dickens dossier. I think they have a duty – not just to the Home Office and the inquiry but to the public. ‘They have a responsibility to assist in terms of confirming whether the dossier exists or not. ‘It would be pretty appalling if they chose to hide the fact that they held the Dickens dossier. ‘It could be that they failed to act on what’s in the dossier and they are trying to keep a low profile in the hope it blows over.’ He made his demands after an FOI request by this newspaper gave the first hint that the Met may have the sought-after dossier. The MoS asked this March for access to files on the investigations the Met carried out into the notorious Paedophile Information Exchange and all the documents it received on the group and its members, including those sent by Dickens, who died in 1995. Last night Scotland Yard was told to come clean about what it has – or risk fresh accusations of a cover-up . The Yard’s FOI team replied in June, refusing to release the information in case it interfered with investigations, and to avoid revealing personal information. But within the five-page letter were several hints that the Met had indeed found the documents compiled by Dickens. It stated: ‘The searches located records relevant to your request… I have considered your request for information within the provisions set out by the Act and can confirm that the requested information is held by the MPS. ‘Having located and considered the relevant information, I am afraid that I am not required by statute to release the information requested. I have applied this exemption in that the names and personal details of any living individuals identified in the reports constitute personal data which would, if released, be in breach of the rights provided by the DPA.’ But a spokesman for the force said last night the admissions in the FOI response should not be taken as confirmation that the force did have the particular dossier given by Dickens to the Home Office. He said: ‘The Freedom of Information response makes it clear that records relevant to the request are held. However it does not indicate what those records are and it would be wrong to use that FOI response as confirmation that specific documents are held.’ The spokesman declined to answer specific questions on what documents it did have and when it had found them, and would only add: ‘The Metropolitan Police Service will fully co-operate with the review led by Peter Wanless and the panel chaired by Baroness Butler-Sloss and provide detail of relevant information. ‘Whilst these and live police investigations are ongoing, it would be inappropriate to comment on this further.’ Dickens said on one occasion he had handed over ‘eight names of big people, really important names’ including a former friend of his. Other files were said to expose ‘paedophilia in Buckingham Palace and the diplomatic and civil services’ and a ‘top television executive’ as well as ‘child abuse and sex assaults at a children’s home’.","Campaigning MP Simon Danczuk called on police to reveal what information it has after MoS was given first indication bombshell file had been found .

"After a busy couple of weeks campaigning for the Democrats in the run up to the midterm elections, Michelle Obama looked happy to be back on safer ground on Monday when she attended several non-political events including an award ceremony for after school programs at the White House. With her husband’s approval ratings at a record low, the first lady was on the campaign trail in Iowa, Florida, Wisconsin, Maine and other states ahead of last Wednesday’s elections in a bid to try and rally Democrat supporters. With the disappointment of the party's poor election cycle behind her, she looked radiant in a sleeve-less black top and multi-colored skirt as she returned to more typical first lady business on Monday. Michelle Obama looked happy to be back on safer ground on Monday when she attended several non-political events including an award ceremony for after school programs at the White House . The first lady hugs Cristone Ingram, 15, of the Delta Blues Museum Arts and Education Program, of Clarksdale, Mississippi, during the 2014 National Arts and Humanities Youth Program Awards on Monday . In Arlington, Virginia, she spoke at a career development forum for women veterans transitioning to civilian life and encouraged them to be bold in their next career step. ‘If you want a job, you can't be modest. You've got to show off a little bit,’ she said. ‘And believe me, you all have so much to show off.’ On the eve of Veterans Day, she announced new commitments from online networks LinkedIn and Coursera in partnering with the government to help service members and veterans. After that she rushed back to the White House when she presented national arts and humanities awards to 12 after-school programs from across the country and one international program. Michelle Obama pauses as she delivers remarks during an event with military children and families that screened a special Veteran's Day episode of Disney's Doc McStuffins,  on Monday . In Arlington, Virginia, the first lady spoke at a career development forum for women veterans transitioning to civilian life and encouraged them to be bold in their next career step . The first lady thanked the art educators for not only teaching children skills, but for putting a 'spring in their step' and giving them something to look forward to after school. The White House ceremony included a head-bopping musical performance from the Delta Blues Museum Arts and Education Program Band of Clarksdale, Mississippi, and remarks by 16-year-old Jennifer Guadalupe Gonzalez of Chicago, who explained how acting in a Shakespeare production gave her a boost of confidence. The 2014 National Arts and Humanities Youth Program Awards are hosted by the President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities in partnership with three national cultural agencies.

Once again she spoke to the families present before the screening a special Veteran's Day episode of Disney's Doc McStuffins, that explored the emotions children face when a parent is deployed. Prior to last Wednesday’s midterms, Michelle Obama has been on a whirlwind tour of the country since September, appearing roughly 40 times with Democratic candidates. While only 41 percent of Americans approve of the president’s job, some 62 percent of respondents in a July Pew Research Center poll said they had a favorable view of the first lady. 'She just tells a different story, because she's not a politician and she's not an elected official,' Jim Demers, a Democratic lobbyist, told the Wall Street Journal.

"A woman whose fiance was killed in a motorcycle crash has extracted his sperm to fulfill their dream of having a baby, after strangers donated to pay for the procedure. Cameron Robinett, of Tucson, Arizona, was desperate to be a father. But last Friday, while house hunting in California, the 25-year-old motorcyclist crashed. Three days later he died in hospital. Devastated, Stephanie Lucas, 22, had just a small window of opportunity to extract sperm from her partner to hold on to the couple's dream of becoming parents. Stephanie Lucas has extracted sperm from her fiance Cameron Robinett, pictured, after he was killed in a motorcycle crash. After pleading for help to raise $6,000 to pay for the procedure, strangers donated . Last Friday, while house hunting in California, 25-year-old Mr Robinett crashed. Three days later he died in hospital leaving Miss Lucas devastated . Immediately she went online and urgently pleaded for funds to pay for the procedure. Touched by her appeal, strangers raised more than $11,000 (£7,000) in just one day - with several anonymous donations of $1,000 and $2,000. 'We were so excited about having a family,' Miss Lucas told MailOnline. 'Cameron was particularly excited. He said: ""We don't need to be married to have a family. Let's start one now"". 'He really wanted to be a daddy, so I'm just fulfilling his dream.' Mr Robinett had been viewing houses in California, where the couple planned to move to, when the accident happened on Friday. He was badly injured and passed away in Eden Hospital on Monday. 'He loved his motorcycle,' Miss Lucas recalled. 'I didn't mind him riding it. I knew he loved it, although I always told him to be careful. 'He was an adventurer. He was eccentric with a huge, open heart. He would give you the shirt off his back. I want to pass that onto our baby. We are so thankful to god we had time with him.' She said the procedure to extract the sperm cost around £5,600 ($9,000) and it will be kept in cold storage for up to a year. 'When I found out Cameron died, I was heartbroken,' she said. 'But I realised immediately I wanted to have his baby and I knew that I didn't have long. Miss Lucas, 22, had just a small window of opportunity to extract sperm from her partner to hold on to the couple's dream of becoming parents. Immediately she went online to plead for help to afford the procedure . Touched by her appeal, strangers raised more than $11,000 (£7,000) in just one day - with several anonymous donations of $1,000 and $2,000 . 'Within hours I went online and pleaded for help on Go Fund Me. It was quick but the only way to do it.' Her message on the site, read: 'My fiance Cameron was in a motorcycle accident on Friday and was declared brain dead today. 'We wanted children very much and my family and his family and I have all decided we'd love to still make this happen. 'This baby would be truly loved and surrounded by an amazing family. 'Unfortunately the cost to extract the sperm is $6,000 that must be paid upfront by tomorrow evening, an amount we won't be able to come up with on our own. 'In lieu of flowers or gifts to honour Cameron, we're asking you to make a donation to actually bring a part of Cameron, the amazing, handsome, silly, guy that I loved with my whole heart, back to life.' Miss Lucas said she doesn't yet know when she'll implant it. 'The grief is very raw at the moment but I want his baby, our baby,' she said. She said a visit to where Mr Robinett was staying in California yesterday reinforced her decision to go through with the sperm extraction. After visiting the funeral home to pick up Mr Robinett's urn, Miss Lucas and his family visited the crash site and his home in California. Miss Lucas, said: 'We started to go through his clothes and found that each of his favourite things brought back a memory that made us laugh or smile. 'After all the stories were shared and laundry was sorted, we were about to leave and Cameron's mum said, ""one more look"". 'We tried to convince her otherwise but she was determined. And we are so glad, because buried in Cameron's laundry was a jersey, a Seahawks jersey. Miss Lucas said: 'I will never be able to say it enough - thank you for your support. It is everything' Miss Lucas said she does not know when she will have the sperm implanted, but said she knows Mr Robinett, who was desperate to become a father, will be looking down on her and their baby . 'But not just any jersey, a Marshawn Lynch jersey in size 0-3 months. Something we bought last Christmas for our future baby. 'Cameron only brought a few things with him to California, and one of the things he brought was this jersey. 'Our jaws dropped and then we all smiled and looked up to the heavens to say - ""we hear you Cameron"", and everyone has come together to make this happen. 'I will never be able to say it enough - thank you for your support. It is everything.' She told how she met Cameron, who ran Sweet Garlic Company, in 2011 through work, becoming engaged in December 2012. Now she has the support of her family including mother Debbie and Cameron's mother Loretta, to have their baby. 'I wasn't sure how our mums would feel but they were really supportive,' she said. 'I am beyond grateful for people's help. 'I was feeling so defeated when I found out the procedure would be so expensive and the money had to be paid upfront. 'I had lost not just my fiancé and my future, but my future family too. 'I've now been given the gift of a future. I think Cameron will be looking down on us.' A Fremont Police spokeswoman said: 'The motorcyclist collided with the garage of a residence. The motorcyclist was transported to a trauma center with life threatening injuries.'","Cameron Robinett was house hunting when he crashed on Friday .

"It could be bad news for professional race car drivers - a self driving car has beaten one of their ranks for the first time. Researchers at Stanford have been working with Audi to develop a high speed self driving car. The team has designed an Audi TTS dubbed 'Shelley' which has been programmed to race on its own at speeds above 120 mph at Thunderhill Raceway Park in Northern California. It its latest test, it was pitted against  David Vodden, the racetrack CEO and amateur touring class champion - and was faster by 0.4 of a second. Scroll down for video . The team has designed an Audi TTS dubbed 'Shelley' which has been programmed to race on its own at speeds above 120 mph at Thunderhill Raceway Park in Northern California . Shelley was named after Michele Mouton, the first woman to win the race up Pikes Peak in the Rocky Mountains. It its latest test, it was pitted against David Vodden, the racetrack CEO and amateur touring class champion - and was faster by 0.4 of a second. Shelley knows exactly where she is on the road by using a differential GPS. Unlike a standard GPS system, hers corrects for interference in the atmosphere, showing the car's position on the Earth with an accuracy of about 2 centimeters. Shelley measures her speed and acceleration with wheel-speed sensors and an accelerometer, and gets her bearings from gyroscopes, which control equilibrium and direction. 'The typical male response is, it'll never beat me,' David Vodden admitted to NBC. The white Audi TTS was last year put through its paces on the Thunderhill Raceway, north of Sacramento, California. Affectionately named Shelley is the result of a collaboration between Stanford's Dynamic Design Lab, led by mechanical engineering design graduate Chris Gerdes, and the Volkswagen Electronics Research Lab. The results were revealed during a briefing at the American Association for the Advancement of Science's annual meeting in San Jose. In a computerized comparison of Shelley's and Vodden's performance, Vodden picked up time on some turns - but Shelley was able to battle back, beating Vodden by four-tenths of a second. 'Now to be totally honest and open about this, I can start this competition at a different point on the track, and David wins by 0.4 seconds, so there is still not a clear victory here,' Gerdes said. 'But the point we wanted to make is that we've gotten fairly comparable to an expert driver in terms of our ability to drive around the track.' As the pair race, sensors record variables such as the driver's body temperature and heart rate. Scalp . electrodes will be used to register the driver's brain activity as they . race against other humans to determine which driving manoeuvres require . the most concentration and brainpower. However, despite the autonomous car's sophisticated technology, it still can't quite compete with human-driven equivalents. As the pair race, sensors record variables such as the driver's body temperature and heart rate. Graduate research team leader Chris Gerdes shows off the systems carried onboard the autonomous car, a modified Audi TTS . Despite the loss, Vodden and his fellow race drivers have built up an instinctive sense about when and how far to push their vehicles. 'Shelley doesn't have what I call the 'butt sense' yet,' Vodden said. 'Once she does get that butt sense, I'll be enthralled.' 'Human drivers are very, very smooth,' said Gerdes. Shelley computes the fastest line around a course and executes the exact corrections required to stick to it. A person relies more on feel and intuition, and thus may, for example, allow the car to swing too wide in one turn if he knows it sets him up better for the next. 'Human drivers are ok with the car operating in a comfortable range of states,' said Gerdes. 'We're trying to capture some of that spirit.' 'We need to know what the best drivers do that makes them so successful,' said Gerdes. 'If we can pair that with the vehicle dynamics data, we can better use the car's capabilities.' The team believes that the experience and the data they have gained can be used to develop autonomous vehicles for use on public roads. Shelley measures her speed and acceleration with wheel-speed sensors and an accelerometer, and gets her bearings from gyroscopes, which control equilibrium and direction. In the nearer term, the technology could be used as an onboard co-pilot that helps the driver steer out of a dangerous situation. The reality of racing a car round a track and pushing that vehicle to its absolute limit means that it will be subjected to exceptionally high levels of stress. One recent test left Shelley without any brake pads due to the intense heat generated by friction between the tyres and the pads themselves. Pushing a car to the limit on the racetrack is one of the best ways to find out what type of stress that car is under in a crisis. 'If we can figure out how to get Shelley out of trouble on a race track, we can get out of trouble on ice,' said Gerdes.","Audi TTS dubbed 'Shelley' raced at Thunderhill Raceway Park in California .

"A special grand jury today issued five indictments against Democrat Joseph Morrissey, from Henrico, Virginia, including allegations of illicit sex . A Democrat politician has been charged after  allegedly having sex with a minor, it was revealed today. Joseph Morrissey, who represents Henrico, Virginia, was issued with five indictments by a grand jury on Monday. These include felony counts of indecent liberties with a minor, . possession of pornographic images of an underage female and of . solicitation to obtain the images. Special prosecutor William Neely told The Times-Dispatch: 'He had sex with her twice in his law office and texted someone about it.' Last August, Henrico police were asked . to check on a 17-year-old girl by her father who was worried about her . relationship with Morrissey. Officers found the teenager and the 56-year-old at his townhouse. The teenage girl, Morrissey and his lawyers claimed that the girl was a secretary in his law office who had lied about her age and that the relationship was 'appropriate and professional'. They allegedly met up because the girl wanted to talk about personal problems. Morrissey who is currently single and father to three daughters by three different women, was a 'consummate gentleman', according to his lawyer, Anthony Troy, a former state attorney general. Mr Troy said that the young woman, her mother and her grandmother all denied that sex took place. The grand jury has spent months deliberating the politician's case. Morrissey, 56, also was indicted on Monday on a . felony charge of distribution of child pornography and a misdemeanor . charge of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. The Democrat is facing up to 40 years in prison if convicted. The Democrat has been a state delegate since 2008. He is now expected to be taken into custody by Henrico County police pending his arraignment. It is not clear if he will be released on bond. In the early 1990s when he was a defense lawyer, he got into a punch-up with another attorney. He had his legal license suspected in 2000 but failed to tell clients resulting in a nine-year revocation, according to the Times-Dispatch. He was back in the spotlight in January 2013, when during a debate on gun control he pulled out an unloaded AK-47 and waved it around on the floor of the House of Delegates.

"Democrats spent as much as $50,000 a trip in the midterm elections to fly Bill and Hillary Clinton into battleground areas to make appearances on behalf of top congressional and gubernatorial candidates, a news report revealed today. And the party has little to show for the massive expenditures, expected to collectively reach a $1 million when final campaign finance reports are turned in. Democrats lost their majority in the upper chamber of the legislative branch, and GOP underdog candidates nosed ahead in several governors races. Failed to deliver: Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, left, campaigns with former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, right, during a campaign rally on Nov. 1. Federal election filings show that Grimes paid $17,000 to have Clinton flown in to drudge up votes for her in October, yet she still lost . The Iowa Democratic Party paid $50,000 to bring former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton into the Hawkeye State to headline retiring Sen. Tom Harkin's annual steak fry in September and campaign for Democratic Senate nominee Bruce Braley . As National Journal pointed out on election night, just eight of the 17 high-profile candidates Hillary Clinton personally campaigned for won reelection last week. Additionally, Arkansas Sen. Mark Pryor got hands-on campaign help from Bill, but not from Hillary – and he also lost. One other senator Hillary backed, Louisiana's Mary Landrieu, is headed to a run-off election next month that polls say she will likely lose, giving the political power couple an eight for 18 record overall this fall. A more comprehensive review of the Clintons' travel schedule issued by Buzzfeed today that includes fundraisers and all the races the duo involved themselves in at every level of government puts Bill's individual count at 47 candidates and Hillary's at upward of 26. The news publication's research shows that the former first couple participated in approximately 75 rallies and fundraisers and flew more than 50,000 miles crisscrossing the country - in private jets - on behalf of Democratic candidates. Buzzfeed discovered that the party's top recruits spent at least $699,000 on the Clintons' travel through Oct. 15, when the last finance reports were due. Among those candidates willing to pay the big bucks in order to buy an appearance from a Clinton were Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, the Democratic nominee to the Senate in the Bluegrass State. Grimes - who handily lost her race to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell - paid $17,000 for Hillary's charter flight ahead of an Oct. 15 appearance, Politico revealed last week. She paid a yet-to-be disclosed sum for Hillary to return to Kentucky in the final days of the campaign, as well, that is likely on par with the original billing. According to Bloomberg, the Iowa Democratic Party paid $50,000 in September to bring both Clintons to the state to headline retiring Sen. Tom Harkin's annual steak fry and campaign for their chosen replacement for Harkin's seat, Rep. Bruce Braley, whom Bill Clinton unforgettably called 'Bruce Bailey' in his remarks. Democrats again paid to bring both Clintons back to the Hawkeye State on two separate occasions to campaign for Braley - who also lost - but those trips have not yet been reported to the FEC. Most of the high-profile Democrats the Clinton's campaigned for this fall lost their races. That includes Georgia Senate candidate Michelle Nunn, seen here at an October 31 rally in at Atlanta, Georgia with Bill Clinton . In an email today highlighting Hillary Clinton's eyebrow-raising travel costs both on and off the campaign trail, the Republican National Committee gave the presumed 2016 presidential candidate the nickname 'high-flying Hillary' in response to Buzzfeed's report. 'The Clintons' Midterm Support For Fellow Democrats Came With A Hefty Price Tag,' read the briefing's tagline. 'It's not just political events where Hillary Clinton prefers to ""travel in style,' the document said, pointing back to a Las Vegas Review-Journal article outlining the former first lady's expensive tastes. On top of her six-figure speaking fees, a contract with the University of Nevada shows that she usually demands to fly on a 'Gulfstream 450 or larger jet,' accommodations in the 'presidential suite' of hotels, rooms in the same block for her entourage of 'travel aids,' $500 to cover her lead aide's out-of-pocket costs and money to cover her party's meals and 'incidentals.' Her contract also specifies how her presence at the events can be billed and how many people she will take photos with afterward. Republican research firm America Rising, a leading voice in the anti-Clinton 2016 sphere, has been documenting Clinton's cushy travel accommodations for months. In a blog post today the group said, 'Democrats griping about the President’s fundraising or lack thereof for their midterm campaign might want to take note of the expensive tab the Clintons billed campaigns for their private jet travel.' 'Sure seems like what really happened was Sec. Clinton got midterm Democrats to foot the bill for her 2016 campaign travel,' the group said in an Election Day blog. Former Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton's appearances on behalf of Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor weren't enough to save the Arkansas lawmaker, either . One candidate Hillary Clinton campaigned for, Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu, may still have a shot at keeping her seat in a run-off election next month, but the odds aren't good . Throughout the fall America Rising has suggested in emails to reporters that millionaire Clinton should pay for her own way when she drops in to election hot zones. 'Keep in mind it would only take 4 hours worth of speaking gigs for Hillary to have picked up the travel tab herself,' it said today in a post on its website. However, as Buzzfeed points out, that would violate election laws in most circumstances. Asked for a clarification on the organization's argument today, America Rising Executive Director Tim Miller told MailOnline in an email: 'The Clintons traveled to plenty of campaign events on corporate dimes this past cycle.' Miller pointed to Clinton's trip to Las Vegas, during which she managed to work in a campaign stop for the Nevada Democratic Party and  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid into her schedule while there on behalf of UNLV. At another point this fall Clinton made a brief public appearance with  Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn and attended a fundraiser for him while she was in the city on other business. Miller told MailOnline the point of America Rising's comments about her travel funding was to bring attention to the 'absurdity of her speaking fees in addition to the excessive cost they put on campaigns. 'Plus there are options for cheaper travel, of course,' he said. Clinton could, theoretically, travel commercially, as fellow 2016 frontrunner Rand Paul did this election cycle as he hopped from state to state. Realistically, though, it would be more difficult, if not impossible, for the Clintons, who still have mandatory Secret Service details, to take transportation open to the public. Buzzfeed noted in its report that Hillary often travels with four agents. Getting all of them seats near her on cross country flights, sometimes into rural airports, would be complicated, to say the least.","Expenditures on the Clintons' travel are expected to collectively reach a $1 million when final campaign finance reports are turned in .

"Dieters have been warned that using a popular over-the-counter slimming pill could put them at risk of severe organ damage. A U.S. study has claimed that taking Alli, which helps to block the absorption of fat from food, impacts on a key enzyme within the body and could lead to 'severe toxicity of internal organs such as the liver and kidney'. Researchers have also claimed the weight-loss aid hampers the effectiveness of medicines including some anti-cancer drugs. 'Wonder drug': Alli claims to aid slimmers with their weight loss - but researchers say taking the pills can lead to organ damage . Rhode Island University's Professor Bingfang Yan, who led the study, has said there has been a 'drastic increase in toxicity' among people using Alli since it was made available over the counter. Popular: The UK launch of Alli triggered massive sales in 2009 . According to a report in the Daily Express, the professor said Orlistat - Alli's active ingredient - inhibits carboxylesterase-2, an enzyme he said works to detoxify the liver, kidney and gastrointestinal tract. 'When the activity of this enzyme drops in those organs, toxicity increases or the efficacy of some drugs is altered,' said Professor Yan. He said the enzyme's ability to metabolise a wide range of medicines, and that the effectiveness of those medicines - in particular a number of anti-cancer drugs - was at risk of being 'weakened' by the use of Orlistat. GlaxoSmithKline, which makes the slimming aid, has strongly refuted any suggestion that Alli is unsafe. 'Earlier this year the European regulator reaffirmed the safety profile of Orlistat following a review of the medicine and possible side-effects,' a spokesman said. The drugs giant also said the results of the U.S. study, which was published in the Biochemical Pharmacology journal, were based on laboratory tests rather than tests on humans, and were inconsistent with data gathered from patients treated with Orlistat. Alli triggered massive sales when it was launched in the UK in 2009 - £1million worth of the pills were sold on the first day.","Alli can cause 'toxicity' in organs and can hamper the effectiveness of medicines including anti-cancer drugs, according to a new study .

"A prestigious New York art school confiscated a fridge full of sperm from a student's art show after deciding it was a health and safety risk. 'Take This Sperm and Be Free of Me' involved Marc Bradley Johnson displaying 68 vials of his semen in a fridge and inviting visitors to take a vial home with them from Manhattan's Visual Arts Gallery. Johnson said that the vials represented 'creation, parenting, desire, masculinity, fantasy, and reality', but his art school was less than impressed, calling it 'bio-hazardous waste' Health Hazard: Artist Marc Bradley Johnson's art work involving giving away sperm to the public did not impress his art school . Johnson, a 23-year old student, said that he took precautions before his debut last Friday, agreeing to microwave the . samples before displaying them to the public: 'The semen is dead. The swimmers are not swimming'. Johnson protested that he had shown the work many times in class and that there was 'plenty of bio-hazardous work in the art world' in any case. I've been working on this for months,' Johnson complained to the Daily Intelligencer. The day after the fridge went on show, Johnson received an e-mail from the art school's director of environmental health and safety, John . DeLuca. DeLuca said that after he had checked with a biomedical scientist, he realised that there was 'no . way to ensure the sperm samples would be 100 percent free of pathogens.' He added: 'In order to protect the public we will need to secure the refrigerator until I . can arrange to have the sperm samples disposed of as hazardous . biowaste.' The semen was then quarantined as a health hazard in an administrator's . office until a waste-management firm could dispose of it. Eventually the university called off the professional disposal after Johnson claimed it was censorship. The art school and Johnson reached a compromise by agreeing that the refrigerator would be sealed and the vials would not be available to take away. Johnson's work also proved controversial last year when he paraded around New York dressed as Jesus Christ, for a piece entitled 'The Narcissim of God'.","New York art school confiscated student's fridge full of sperm .

His first birthday also saw him unwrap Elephant dung, fruit and cake to help him savour the day. Playful: Loki the one year old European brown bear celebrates at Blair Drummond Safari Park near Stirling .

The young bear was helped by his . eight-year-old mother Nellie to open the presents and eat a fruit loaf . cake baked in the shape of a number one and decorated with dog biscuits, . Loki's favourite snack . The one-year-old, born in Blair Drummond Safari Park near Stirling, was particular taken with a buoy he found in one of the boxes staff wrapped with happy-birthday paper. He tossed the orange ball around his enclosure until it broke and as he explored inside, managed to get his head stuck in it. Loki's head keeper Vicky Kydd said: 'We filled big cardboard boxes with lots of his favourite enrichment materials and treat bits which included pine wood shavings, elephant dung, balls and old tyres. Best gift: Loki unwraps the bright orange buoy on the ice at his Scottish home . 'The bears love rolling around in the dung and the wood shavings and it helps them to groom and maintain their coats, particularly over winter. 'We also filled enrichment balls with his favourite treats and Loki had a great time opening his presents. 'I think Nellie was a little bit jealous because they are her favourite treats as well so she was right in there helping Loki open the boxes and I think she stole a few of the presents.' Loki, like other bears around the world, will build up fat reserves now and run it off in the Spring . Loki enjoys a diet of honey, nuts and dog biscuit cake to help build up a thick warm coat .

He now ways around 100kg and can continue to grow to as heavy as 450kg, around 70st, and live for around 30 years. His father, Bull, moved to Olmense Zoo in Belgium earlier this year, as the bears only come together for breeding and the male plays no part in raising cubs. Blair Drummond manager Gary Gilmour said the feast of treats will help the bears as they prepare to hibernate. 'Although the bears are less active now and are eating less food, both Loki and mum Nellie made short work of the cake. Honey, nuts and dog biscuit cake is a really good treat but is also good for healthy growth, producing a nice thick winter coat and winter fat storage. 'Loki will run off any excess fat in the spring. He is so playful and an absolute joy to watch in his enclosure.'

"Lamde duck: The Global Times has published an editorial deriding Obama days before a visit to China . A mouthpiece of the Chinese Government has described President Obama as 'insipid' and claims U.S. voters are sick of his 'banality'. The state-run Global Times has published an editorial deriding the leader a few days ahead of his visit to the growing economic and military powerhouse. It stated: 'Obama always utters ""Yes, we can,"" which led to the high expectations people had for him. But he has done an insipid job, offering nearly nothing to his supporters. 'U.S. society has grown tired of his banality.' The criticism comes in the wake of a crushing defeat in the Midterm elections worse even than the most pessimistic forecasts of the Democrats' strategists, with the Republicans now in control of both the upper and lower Houses of Congress. The Global Times lists the 'lame-duck' president's perceived failures in foreign policy and the economy. It said Obama took: 'U.S. troops out of Iraq and Afghanistan, but left no peace. 'Osama bin Laden was killed during his tenure, but (ISIS) has emerged from the Middle East.' Despite an improvement in the American economy, the editorial criticises his inability to lower the income gap, claiming ordinary Americans have not benefited from the recovery. However, the piece does admit that Obama faced many problems when he took the reins of power, inheriting a moribund economy and 'the decline of U.S. influence'. It also takes aim at the political system in America, claiming it is 'too lazy to reform'. Cheers Barack: Chinese President Xi Jinping, who ranks just after Obama in Forbes' most recent list of the 72 most power people in the world, will host the U.S. president when he visits China next week . Obama will focus on the global economy and U.S. policy toward the Asia-Pacific region during stops next week in China, Myanmar and Australia. The itinerary includes a state visit with Chinese President Xi Jinping. While in China, Obama will attend the APEC Leaders Meeting and the APEC chief executive Summit. In Forbes recent list of the 72 most powerful people in the world, Obama came second to Russian president Vladimir Putin, closely followed by People's Republic of China leader Xi Jinping.","Global Times editorial called the U.S. President a 'lame duck'

"A Chinese teacher has been drawing on his experience to help students learn more about the world around them. Middle school geography teacher, Wang Boming, is one of the world’s best free-hand map drawers. He uses his unique talent in his classes to sketch incredibly accurate maps of the world by memory in an incredible four minutes, Shanghaiist website said. Wang Boming, a former art education major from Sha'anxi province, said he practised sketching out countries and continents all the time while he was in middle school. Now every day he continually sits in his office studying the globe and practising his drawing skills, so that he can make his maps perfect and precise. Scroll down for video . Wang Boming begins sketching his map of the world on the blackboard . Teaching a class of 60 students at his school in Ningxia, China, Wang starts his lesson by drawing a map of the world on the blackboard. While drawing the map he speaks to his students about each country or continent he’s drawing. Four minutes later a complete map of the world is on the blackboard, a feat that drew gasps and a round of applause from his students. 'I used to think that geography was boring but when he drew the map it made the class livelier,' one student, Li Yedan, said. 'Following his map was like travelling around the world. It showed us how interesting how geography can be.' Only after a minute of sketching he is already well on his way to completing the task . After three minutes' work he just has to add the final touches . Another student, Liu Junhao, agreed and thought that Wang’s unique style of teaching helped to make classes more interesting. 'He shows us the world and helps us to understand more about our planet,' Liu said. Wang explained that one of his former teachers always drew maps in class, which gave him the inspiration to do the same for his students. It takes him four minutes to draw a map of the world in his classroom . “I find drawing maps to be a more direct and engaging way to interest students in geography. It grabs their attention and makes them more interested in the subject. This makes them enjoy the class even more,” he said. But Wang still thinks he can do better. In his office he has a globe of the world on his table, and he spends time daily studying the globe and practising his drawing to make them even more accurate. By continual study Wang believes he can draw his maps even more precisely . 'I still practice a lot and compare my work to original maps so I can be more precise,' he said. Students said Wang was able to weave together knowledge to broaden their perspective. When drawing his maps Wang also often talks about world news and the goings on in each country he is drawing. As a result of his impressive map drawing skills Wang is attracting attention outside the classroom . It's a novel approach that brings his students on a trip around the world without ever leaving their classroom.","Middle school geography teacher, Wang Boming, uses amazing free-hand sketches to teach his students .

"House Speaker John Boehner told the nation's leader in a face-to-face meeting on Friday in no uncertain terms that he could kiss real reforms to the immigration system goodbye if he followed through on his plans to give up to 11 million illegal immigrants amnesty. A statement from Boehner's office after today's White House meeting with congressional leaders says 'the speaker warned that unilateral action by the president on executive amnesty will erase any chances of doing immigration reform and will also make it harder for Congress and the White House to work together successfully on other areas where there might otherwise be common ground.' In a statement of its own after the strategy session the White House said that Obama still intends to act before the end of the year, regardless of the GOP's opposition to the move. Scroll down for video . Speaker of the House John Boehner, right, told President Barack Obama to his face today during a luncheon that acting on immigration through executive order would have significant costs . No more Mr. Nice Guy: Boehner of Ohio told reporters yesterday during a Capitol Hill  press conference that Obama was playing with fire when it came to immigration and he well on his way to getting burned . At the meeting, the White House said, the president 'reiterated his commitment to taking action on immigration reform in light of the House’s inability to pass a comprehensive bill.' Before the post-election summit White House Press Secretary told reporters that the president has given House Republicans 'ample' time to pass reforms preferred by the president, yet Boehner declined to bring a version of the Senate-passed immigration bill, which includes those changes, to floor. And yesterday, Earnest said, Boehner refused to put forward a timeline for when House Republicans would pass any sort of immigration legislation at all. 'So it’s hard to take seriously this suggestion that Republicans actually do want to work with the president to pass immigration reform,' Earnest said. 'There is one thing they can do to prevent the president from taking executive action,' Earnest said, and that is to 'allow that common sense, bipartisan bill passed by the Senate to come to the floor of the House of Representatives. 'If the House passes that Senate bill, the president won’t take executive action.' The Obama spokesman said that even if House Republicans do not act in the 'best interest in the country, the president’s not going to miss that opportunity.' Several hours after the meeting, other attendees of the luncheon with Obama had not issued statements with the exception of Senate Minority Whip John Cornyn, a Texas Republican. Remaining silent were Senate Majority Leader Senator Harry Reid, Senate Minority Leader Senator Mitch McConnell, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, House Majority Kevin McCarthy and House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer. Similarly mum were lower ranking lawmakers in the meeting, Senate Republican Conference Chairman John Thune,·House Republican Conference Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Democratic Caucus Chairman Xavier Becerra, Vice Chair of the Democratic Conference in the Senate Chuck Schumer, Senate Budget Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray and Republican Policy Committee Chairman John Barrasso. In his statement Cornyn said he, too, 'made clear to the President that we should tackle immigration reform together on a step-by-step basis, beginning with border security and respect for the rule of law.' 'Unfortunately the President’s promise to unilaterally go around Congress ignores the message voters sent on Election Day,,' he said, referring to the GOP's victories at the ballot box on Tuesday. 'It is my sincere hope that he will reverse course and work with us – not around us – to secure the border and achieve real reforms to our immigration system.' According to the White House the president and Capitol Hill lawmakers also discussed 'emergency' Ebola funding that the president requested from Congress this week and the need for the legislative branch to pass a new budget  'in the same bipartisan, drama-free way they did earlier this year.' Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, Office of Management and Budget Director Shawn Donovan and U.S. Central Command head General Lloyd Austin also briefed the group on the fight against ISIS in Iraq and Syria, the White House aid, and requested an additional $5.6 billion from them to support the military mission. The Pentagon today announced that it would be sending 1,500 more troops overseas to train Iraqi security forces. Boehner's office said other topics of discussion the 'more than 40 House-passed jobs bills' targeted at creating jobs and jump starting the economy and the creation of a new Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) for military engagement in Iraq. The White House maintains that it does not need new congressional authority to bomb Islamic militants, arguing that a decade-old AUMF issued by the legislature in the wake of the Iraq war is enough, but a bipartisan cadre of representatives has openly disagreed. The Speaker's office said Boehner today 'urged' the president to send in a new request to satisfy those concerns . In a preview of today's meeting, Boehner suggested to reporters yesterday that he would confront Obama about his ill-advised plans to act on immigration. 'When you play with matches, you take the risk of burning yourself,' Boehner said Thursday during a Washington, D.C. press conference. 'And he's going to burn himself if he continues to go down this path.' The GOP leader was responding at the time to Obama's commitment on Wednesday 'to take whatever lawful actions' he can to make changes to the deportation process - with or without the permission of Congress. 'I've consistently said that it is my profound preference and interest to see Congress act on a comprehensive immigration reform bill,' Obama said during a press conference on Wednesday. 'I think it's fair to say that I've shown a lot of patience and tried to work on a bipartisan basis as much as possible and will keep doing so.' But in the absence of congressional action, Obama again promised to make his own reforms. The president has not said what moves he's considering, but White House officials have indicated that anywhere between one and 11 million illegal immigrants could be allowed to stay in the U.S. as a direct result. Challenging Boehner, Obama said on Wednesday, 'You send me a bill that I can sign and those executive actions go away. 'What we can't do is just keep on waiting,' he argued. 'There's a cost for waiting.' Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who is slated to become Majority Leader of the Senate in January, said Wednesday that Obama was taking the wrong approach to altering the nation's broken immigration system. 'I think the president choosing to do a lot of things unilaterally on immigration would be a big mistake,' McConnell told reporters during a press conference out of Kentucky, where he had just been reelected to his Senate seat the night before. 'It's an issue that most of my members want to address legislatively and it's like waving a red flag in front of a bull to say, ""If you guys don't do what I want, I'm going to do it on my own."" 'I hope he won't do that because I do think it poisons the well for the opportunity to address a very important domestic issue,' McConnell said. Boehner reiterated McConnell's observation on Thursday, saying if Obama acts on his own will to 'poison the well' for broader reforms to the immigration process 'and there will be no chance for immigration reform moving in this Congress. 'The American people made it clear Election Day, they want to get things done, and they don't want the president acting on a unilateral basis,' Boehner said. The House Speaker, who has long said he's in favor of reforming the immigration system in a step-by-step fashion rather than the president's preferred comprehensive method, said he was doing his best to come up with a package that all parties involved could agree to. 'I could regale you with all of my challenges of trying to get members on both sides of the aisle to deal with this. They were numerous. But hope springs eternal,' he said. The White House said in a statement after today's meeting with congressional leaders that he still intends to issue his own set of immigration rules.  Attendees of today's summit are pictured here from left to right are: House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, House Speaker John Boehner, Obama, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer . The Republican legislator signaled on Thursday that the post-election Kumbaya between the White House and Republicans, at least as far as he is concerned, is already over, just two days after the midterm election that gave his party a historic number of seats in Congress. 'My job is not to get along with the president, just to get along with him, although we actually have a nice relationship,' Boehner told reporters. 'My job is to listen to my members and listen to the American people and make their priorities our priorities.' As Boehner was pledging on Capitol Hill to stand his ground, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest was assuring reporters at his daily briefing at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue that the president is dedicated to finding 'common ground' with Republicans in Congress. The president looks forward to meeting with Boehner and other congressional leaders for lunch tomorrow at the White House, Earnest said, suggesting that a new era of bipartisanship could be on the way in Washington. Boehner seemed suspicious on Thursday at his own briefing, across town, that the Democratic president actually intends to compromise with Republicans. 'Finding common ground is going to be hard work, but it will be even harder if the president isn’t willing to work with us,' Boehner said.","According to House Speaker John Boehner's office, the GOP leader warned that 'unilateral action' would 'erase any chances' of immigration reform .

"When welcoming a guest to your TV show it is important to get their name right, so have pity on Fox News host Megyn Kelly who managed to slip up while introducing Mike Huckabee. Kelly managed to pronounce his name correctly the first time around, but when it came to reading out the title of his show - named after himself - she blurted out 'F***abee' instead. As she made the gaffe, former Republican presidential candidate Mr Huckabee appeared to crack a smile before Mrs Kelly corrected herself. When introducing former Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee, Fox News host Megyn Kelly accidentally called him 'F***abee' while pronouncing the name of his self-titled show . Mrs Kelly later addressed the mistake after it drew a wave of mockery on Twitter, saying: 'Something else that happened on the program is also getting a lot of attention on Twitter and including this tweet from some nice man named Sean who said ‘Megyn you’re a delight to watch and gave a stoic performance after your slip up with Governor Huckabee’s name.’ 'I thought I was stoic too – I have a heart of a 12 year old boy.' It is not the first on-air gaffe from Megyn Kelly, who ended up in hot water earlier this year when she made a stand over naming the Fort Hood shooter. Mrs Kelly refused to name Ivan Lopez on her show on the day of the killings, trying to avoid giving him notoriety, but instead described his name as sounding 'Hispanic or Latino'. Mr Huckabee didn't miss a beat, despite Mrs Kelly's mistake - and even appeared to crack a smile. Mrs Kelly later admitted to the error, saying it had attracted a lot of attention on Twitter . That controversy followed on from a race row that she sparked late in 2013 when she described both Santa and Jesus as 'verifiably white'. Mrs Kelly was hitting back at an article saying Santa should be replaced by a penguin because the 'Santa-as-fat-old-white-man' image was not relevant in modern multi-cultured America.

"A retired couple  have been slapped with a noise abatement notice by the council after their neighbours complained that their guinea fowl were too loud. Owners Maurice Dainty, 69, and his wife Phyllis, 71, keep 34 of the birds at their home in the quiet village of Scorton, North Lancashire, as well as a dozen ducks and a few chickens. But after 15 years of keeping the animals in their gardens, their new neighbours complained to Wyre Council that the flock are too noisy. Ruffled feathers: Phyllis and Maurice Dainty have been told they have to move their guinea fowl because they are too noisy, following a complaint from their neighbours . After an inspection by the council, the couple received not one, but four letters from the local authority, telling them they had 21 days to move the guinea fowl. The couple, who have been married for 49 years, have just 10 days to go until the birds have to be moved or they face a fine of up to £5,000. Mr Dainty, a former farm worker, and his wife have been warned the case could be taken to the High Court if necessary to secure 'the abatement, prohibition or restriction of the nuisance'. Speaking to MailOnline, an upset Mrs Dainty said: 'We have to move the birds somehow or else. The council have offered to help but they said they would charge. 'We can't move them anyway as we don't have any more space. The ducks are noisier than the guinea fowl anyway. 'We're both just fed up of it. We'll never be friends with neighbours like that. It's very awkward.' Mr Dainty said: 'Everyone thinks it’s a joke. It’s got past the joking stage. 'I’m 69 and Phyllis is 71 - we’ve never had anything like it in our lives. We are not going to part with them.' The couple say they will write to Defra and the National Farmers' Union to see if either body can help. Fowl play: The retired couple were given 21 days to move their birds or face a fine of up to £5,000 . Planning consultant and family friend Mel Lawrenson said: 'There is a clay pigeon shoot in the next field and they are less than a mile away from the motorway and there are cows and sheep all around. 'They are a registered smallholding - they are allowed to keep these things.' The abatement notice was dated October 1, and gave the family 21 days to move the birds or appeal to a magistrates' court. The council has advised the couple to increase the distance between the guinea fowl and the house next door, or relocate them away from the properties. Rebecca Cavies, from Wyre Council’s environmental protection service, wrote to the Daintys, stating: 'Evidence gathered during our investigations has established the existence of a ‘statutory nuisance’ due to noise from guinea fowl.' The Dainty's next door neighbours, Helen and Richard Leach, moved in just over a year ago and were behind the complaint. They declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Wyre Council said: 'The council is currently investigating a case of noise nuisance at this location. 'It would not be appropriate to comment further.'","Retired couple Maurice and Phyllis Dainty have kept guinea fowl for 15 years .

"Comedian Jimbo Bazoobi has been travelling around Australia for three years with his best mate Gary. Gary sits up the front of Mr Bazoobi's truck as they drive around the outback and watches him perform in pubs around the country. And while on paper it sounds like a normal friendship there's one catch: Gary is actually a goat. Scroll down for video . Comedian Jimbo Bazoobi (right) has been travelling around Australia for three years with Gary the Goat (left) Mr Bazoobi, who has been travelling around Australia for 10 years, drives in his truck with Gary sitting in the front cab next to him . Gary has had an online following ever since a bizarre incident in August 2012 which saw a police officer try to fine Mr Bazoobi because Gary ate flowers out of a garden bed near the Museum of Contemporary Art in Sydney. But recently Gary's popularity has skyrocketed. In February the 'Gary the Goat' fan page on Facebook had 20,000 likes – now it's got more than 715,000. Mr Bazoobi, 44, puts it down to the videos of Gary he's been posting on the page for the past few months. 'It just hit off when I started putting videos up,' he told the Daily Mail Australia from Mataranka in the Northern Territory, about 420km southeast of Darwin. 'I think they can actually see his personality… They just go ""S*** this is a cool goat."" 'They can see I've not just cut and paste pictures of goats or whatever.' He recently purchased a GoPro camera, which he has nicknamed the GoatPro . In February the 'Gary the Goat' fan page on Facebook had 20,000 likes ¿ now it's got more than 715,000 . His and Gary's videos have also been improved by the purchase of a GoPro camera, which he has nicknamed the GoatPro. 'I got it about two months ago but it took me about two months to learn how to use it,' he said. 'I try to do a video each day, all I do is follow Gary around and he kind of writes the script.' Mr Bazoobi is from Sydney but he has been travelling around Australia doing stand-up comedy for the past 10 years. He acquired Gary for a case of beer in Western Australia three years ago and the pair have been inseparable ever since. Mr Bazoobi and Gary have spent the majority of their time together travelling around Western Australia, and have also been to New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland. Mr Bazoobi said his favourite thing about Gary is his sense of adventure . Gary made headlines in Sydney in January last year when he appeared in the Downing Centre Local court over the incident outside the Museum of Contemporary Art. 'A couple of years ago he got a bit of attention for that, he was kind of like the wacky news story for the day,' Mr Bazoobi said. 'It was a fun day taking a goat to court.' The magistrate dismissed the case. Mr Bazoobi travels in his truck with Gary sitting in the front cab next to him. 'I've always treated him as my mate and he is,' he said.

'I lead him around half the time and he leads me around half the time and we just see where we end up,' he said. 'He gets a bit bored when I don't do things with him every day.' Gary receives a mixed reaction from members of the public, but as his online popularity grows it's getting more positive. 'Out in the bush they don't care as much, they basically just laugh I think,' Mr Bazoobi said. 'But a guy yesterday wanted to shoot him because he was eating his bush.' Mr Bazoobi added that he would never sell Gary. Mr Bazoobi will travel to Western Australia after he finishes road tripping around the Northern Territory and he has no plans to stop any time soon . 'I've had a few offers and stuff but as if I'm going to get rid of Gary, he's my mate.' Mr Bazoobi said he thinks people respond well to his and Gary's adventures because he is 'uncensored'. 'A lot of stuff is censored on TV, and just from 10 years of travelling around I'm really just talking the way people talk to their friends,' he said. 'I've got no producer or director or anyone telling me what to do so that helps. 'It's not like I'm waiting on someone to give me a second series, it's just a Facebook page.' Mr Bazoobi will travel back to WA after he finishes road tripping around the Northern Territory and he has no plans to stop any time soon. 'We're just going to keep going,' he said.

"Elmo puppeteer Kevin Clash, recently accused of engaging in underage sex with a male model who says he was 16 at the time, agreed to pay his accuser $125,000 to recant his story. The settlement was struck between the two men several hours before the accuser, Sheldon Stephens, believed to be 24, officially retracted his underage sex allegation, TMZ reports. Under the terms of the settlement, if Mr Stephens is asked by anyone about his relationship with Mr Clash, he must repeat only the following statement: . 'He [Stephens] wants it to be known that his sexual relationship with Mr. Clash was an adult consensual relationship.' Scandal on Sesame Street: Elmo puppeteer Kevin Clash, 52, has resigned amid growing accusations that he slept with underage boys . Model: Sheldon Stephens, 23 of Pennsylvania, accused Elmo Muppeteer Kevin Clash of engaging in sex with him when he was underage . Mr Stephens was crying during the final . negotiations with Mr Clash's lawyer and repeatedly insisted he didn't . want to sign, one source told TMZ. Mr Stephens did sign, however. Mr Stephens of Pennsylvania was . identified by The Smoking Gun on Wednesday as a ‘struggling actor/model’ who was once arrested for allegedly robbing someone at knifepoint for . $250,000. The website said it learned the identity of Mr Stephens from a family member and friend who were not named. Mr Stephens describes himself as an . 'entrepreneur, student, model [and] actor' on his Twitter account. On . his Facebook page, he writes, 'I like to consider myself a rare breed. I'm very spontaneous and random… I'm determined and goal oriented. My . destiny is laid on a solid gold brick pathway... MY FUTURE IS BRIGHT and . never will it dim.' Andreozzi & Associates, the law firm representing Mr Stephens, did not return requests for comment from MailOnline. Mr Stephens had publicly accused Mr Clash of an underage . sexual affair this week and then later recanted his claim. The recantation comes one day after . the accusations against Clash, who is openly gay, were published on TMZ, . setting off a firestorm in the media. Andreozzi & Associates said in a . statement on Mr Stephen's behalf: . 'He wants it to be known that his . sexual relationship with Mr Clash was an adult consensual relationship. He will have no further comment on the matter.' Since the scandal broke, Mr Clash, 52, . has taken a leave of absence from the Sesame Workshop which produces the . popular children's TV show on PBS. Clash, 52, had been on a leave of absence from the Sesame Workshop since the scandal broke . Court records show that Mr Stephens has . been arrested several times since 2009 on charges that include writing a . bad check and reckless driving. His most serious charges were in . September of 2009, when he was arrested at an airport in Pennsylvania . after stepping off a flight from Los Angeles.He was charged in that arrest with robbing his former employer, Darian Pollard, at knifepoint. Pollard accused Mr Stephens of stealing a $250,000 'white gold necklace with diamonds' and a 'white gold ring with diamond baguettes' and then boarding a flight to Pennsylvania, according to a criminal complaint. Mr Stephens was wearing the jewelry when police arrested him and he insisted that the pieces were gifts. Charges filed against him in Pennsylvania were later dropped, however, and charges were never filed in California, The Smoking Gun reported. After Mr Stephens withdrew his allegations, Clash told the New York Times through a . spokesman: 'I am relieved that this painful allegation has been put to . rest. I will not discuss it further.' Mr Clash exchanged messages with his accuser in 2010 in which he apologized for constantly talking about sex and promised to make all of his 'dreams come true.' The puppeteer, who has left the show . in the wake of the accusations, told the man almost 30 years his junior . that he loved him and offered to buy him a ticket to visit him in New . York, it has emerged. The Sesame Street stalwart, who has worked on the show since the mid-80s, admits to having a sexual . relationship with the accuser but insists it only took place after the younger man was an adult. Mr Clash took a leave of . absence from the children's show after Mr Stephens contacted the program's lawyers and told them he had a sexual . relationship with the puppeteer seven years ago. Resignation: Clash has left the popular children's show but that doesn't mean it's the end of the road for Elmo . In the latest emails published by TMZ, sent well after the accuser turned 18, Mr Clash wrote: 'I'm sorry that I keep talking about sex with you, its driving me insane.' He added: 'I want you to know that I love . you and I will never hurt you. I'm here to protect you and make sure . your dreams come true... 'I'll have my assistant book a ticket for you to come to NY and we can talk about this in person.' Mr Clash said the relationship was between two consenting adults and that he was deeply . saddened that the younger man was 'trying to make it into something it was not.' The . accuser reportedly felt he was being silenced after his initial meeting with Sesame Street lawyers. In August, the accuser's lawyers wrote a . letter to Sesame Street accusing the program of trying to 'discredit . the victim in order to protect its . employee and the image of one of its most valuable characters.' The letter also claimed the show's attitude 'places a greater value on a puppet than the well being of . a young man.' Sesame Workshop officials, however, said they found the  the allegation of underage sex was . unsubstantiated after a thorough . investigation. Iconic: Clash, left, who has voiced Elmo for two decades, admits he had a relationship with the man, but only after the accuser was an adult . They say that rather than trying to hush up the accuser, they asked for evidence of his allegations, which was not received. TMZ reported they had seen an email supposedly sent to the accuser by Clash, . acknowledging they had the affair when he was 16, but officials believe it is fake as they say the . accuser never mentioned such an email existed. Sesame Street disciplined Mr Clash . for inappropriate use of company email after they found his messages to . the accuser, but they reportedly did not indicate an illegal sexual . relationship. They said the divorced father of a 19-year-old girl had shown poor judgment, but claimed . his leave of absence was to allow him to defend his reputation in the wake of the damaging allegations. Clash's ex-wife, Gina, declined to comment, but a friend who answered the door at her Baltimore home told the New York Daily News that the former nurse is 'surviving'. In the spotlight: The Sesame Workshop called the controversy 'a distraction that none of us want' A neighbor who did not wish to be identified defended Clash, saying: 'He was really good to her and the family. He's a really nice guy.' Sesame Workshop insisted the scandal surrounding Clash does not mean the end of Elmo. 'Elmo is bigger than any one person,' the company said. Clash has been Elmo's puppeteer for two decades, performing on the show as well as for PBS specials, DVD releases and TV movies, while earning nine Daytime Emmy Awards. He eventually assumed the title of Sesame Street's Senior Puppet Coordinator and Muppet Captain, while also directing and producing show segments and TV specials. He published an autobiography about his career in 2006 called My Life as a Furry Red Monster: What Being Elmo Has Taught Me About Life, Love and Laughing Out Loud. Earlier this year he appeared in Being Elmo: A Puppeteer's Journey, a documentary detailing Clash's journey from a childhood obsession with puppets to assuming his role on the iconic show.","Elmo Puppeteer Kevin Clash, 52, accused of engaging in underage sex with male model, Sheldon Stephens, 24, agreed to pay his accuser $125,000 to retract his story .

"Musician: Talented violinist Natalie Holt said she wanted to protest against Simon Cowell and miming on television . The violinist who pelted Simon Cowell with eggs in the live final of Britain’s Got Talent explained her actions yesterday. Natalie Holt said she was protesting at both his domination of the music industry and performers miming on television. But in turn, she was accused of targeting the music mogul during Saturday’s show as part of a publicity stunt to raise her profile. Millions of viewers saw the 30-year-old musician, a Bafta-nominated composer, walk to the front of the stage carrying a box of eggs, as singers Richard and Adam were performing. With a wide grin, she then began hurling eggs at Cowell, 53. Miss Holt, described as an ‘upstanding young woman’ by her mother, has claimed she was venting her anger after apparently being asked to pretend to play her violin. The ex-grammar school pupil, who has a masters degree from The National Film and Television School, was one of a number of backing musicians and singers asked to perform when the Welsh brothers were on stage. She told the Daily Mail: ‘I took a stand against people miming on television and against Simon Cowell and against his influence on the music industry.’ However while Cowell appeared to take the incident in good humour, he is said to have been 'absolutely furious' off camera after the safety of himself and his panel was called into doubt. A source told the Daily Star newspaper: 'During the break, Simon stormed backstage and told one producer that she could have had a gun. He wasn't so bothered about having been hit by an egg but he was furious that the welfare of not only the judges but also the contestants and the audience could have been at risk.' However, following the incident, some critics took to Twitter to accuse Miss Holt of a publicity stunt. And her friends admitted it was not a spontaneous protest and that she had discussed in advance how she might draw attention to the issue of miming on the show. She had even said that one way to do this might have been to smash her violin during the performance. One said: ‘Goodness only knows how she managed to smuggle half a dozen eggs on to the stage. 'Normally if you are a woman playing, all you are allowed to take with you is a small clutch bag, or something similar. Not something big enough to fit a box of eggs inside.’ Scroll down for video . Apology: Her boyfriend Chris Waitt said Miss Holt had been 'pressured' to say sorry publically after the incident . Protest: Miss Holt was grinning and laughing as she threw the eggs at the judges . A report following the incident . suggested that Miss Holt had even described the type of eggs in a . bizarre defense of her actions. A source told The Sun: 'There was one . very surreal moment when she started going on about the fact the eggs . were organic and from Marks & Spencer. It was like that made . everything all right. It was very odd.' Miss Holt has since apologised, but . her boyfriend Chris Waitt said: ‘Britain’s Got Talent basically . pressured her into apologising so they wouldn’t press charges. She had . to say it was a silly thing to do when really she doesn’t think it was. ‘She . objects to those kind of shows and to Simon Cowell and what he . represents to the music industry. She’s not after personal publicity, . she just wanted to make a point.’ Miss Holt did not leave her flat in Covent Garden yesterday, where she lives with her boyfriend, 39. Escorted away: Miss Holt was taken off stage by security after throwing the eggs . Target: Miss Holt picked out Simon Cowell as she wanted to make a point about his dominance of the music industry . There . have been suggestions she may have targeted Cowell as revenge after she . auditioned for Britain’s Got Talent in 2012 with string quartet Raven, . who performed with Madness at the Olympics closing ceremony. The . group got through the first round but were axed before the live shows, . prompting an angry internet blog post saying: ‘So Raven went on BGT. It . was hellish.’ Miss Holt . was defended by her mother Patricia, 62, who lives in a large detached . cottage in the village of Loose, near Maidstone, Kent, with her husband . Malcolm, 70. It's no yolk: Simon had to remove his jacket after it was hit but he still had some egg on his shirt . Angry: Amanda Holden was less than impressed with the stunt during the final of Britain's Got Talent . She said: ‘We are not Britain’s Got . Talent watchers, so we don’t know what all the fuss is about, except I . know there’s a lot of strong feeling about Simon Cowell and his . influence on the music industry. He does monopolise things, doesn’t he? ‘I . suppose the big point is that you have got all those people at the . front and the people who really know about music are sitting at the back . miming. I think Natalie feels quite strongly about live music being . live.’ Miss Holt's uncle Brian Butt, who lives in Norway, said: 'Unfortunately for her, it gave the impression she was a bit of a nutter - which, believe me, she's not. 'I thought it was some kind of prank the show had got her to do to make it more interesting.' A BGT spokesman . said miming was ‘standard industry practice for backing musicians during . TV performances as it isn’t possible to easily capture the quality of . the sound in a live broadcast environment. All contestants on Britain’s . Got Talent sing live.’ All together: Natalie pictured with the rest of her band, who auditioned for Britain's Got Talent last year .

"It is perceived as one of the most introverted countries in the world with a policy of eradicating any outside influence from foreign nations. But a photographer's stunning collection of images from his journey through the Republic of Iran offers a rare insight into what life in the Islamic state is really like. With its tiny villages nestled into the side of mountains and picturesque farm land, which is rarely seen by outsiders, the country is as enchanting as it is mysterious. But photographer Amos Chapple said the real surprise of Persia was not its untouched and beautiful countryside, but how different it is from 'western perceptions of the country'. Palangan Village, in the mountains near the Iraq border. Palangan, illustrative of many of the country's rural settlements, has benefited handsomely from government support. Many villagers are employed in a nearby fish farm, or are paid members of the Basij, whose remit includes prevention of 'westoxification', and the preservation of everything the 1979 Islamic revolution and its leader the Ayatollah Khomeini stood for, including strict rules on female clothing and male/female interaction. Two shepherds lead Palangan's flock of communally-owned sheep out to pasture. The government's spending in some rural regions has bought them a network of loyal followers who can be scrambled at any time to crush trouble in the urban centers. Rural Basij were used as a part of the crackdown in 2009 which resulted in the deaths of seven anti-government protestors. A group of friends in the hills above Tehran. Many (every single one I met) young Iranians feel deeply embarrassed by their government, and the way the nation is perceived abroad. Zac Clayton, a British cyclist who will finish a round-the-world cycle on March 23 described Iran as having the kindest people of any country he cycled through. 'I found most Iranians -- particularly the younger generation -- to be very aware of the world around them... with a burning desire for the freedoms they feel they are being denied by an out of touch, ultra-conservative religious elite.' Chapple, from New Zealand, has visited the Islamic Republic of Iran three times between December 2011 and January 2013 to accumulate his series of photographs. And he claims while the government continues its anti-western campaign, he found a growing discontent among the country's youth who were embarrassed by the actions of its leaders. He said: 'I was amazed by the difference in western perceptions of the country and what I saw on the ground. 'I think because access for journalists is so difficult, people have a skewed image of what Iran is - the regime actually want to portray the country as a cauldron of anti-western sentiment so they syndicate news footage of chanting nutcases which is happily picked up by overseas networks. The Mausoleum of Ayatollah Khomeini in Tehran. Work on the unfinished building has dragged over 23 years. With growing economic chaos in the country, its completion is still nowhere in sight. At the Sa'adabad Palace complex in northern Tehran, Islamic revolutionaries sawed a statue of the deposed Shah in half. Today schoolchildren are taken on group visits past the boots and into the palace to see the decadence of the former Shah's living quarters. A young worker walks through the light of a stained glass window in the Tehran Bazaar. Under Khomeini Iranians were actively encouraged to produce large families. By 2009 nearly 70 per cent of all Iranians were under 30, but according to some reports, the country is the least religious in the Middle East. Instead of the ""armies for Islam"" Khomeini had called for, the youthful population is now seen as the biggest threat to the deeply unpopular regime. A commemorative plate of the former Shah of Iran in an antique store in Shiraz. The Shah was given an Authoritarian hold on power thanks to an MI6 and CIA-backed coup in 1953 which deposed Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh and cost the lives of several hundreds of Iranian citizens. ""Operation Ajax"" was actioned after Mosaddegh nationalized the petroleum industry of Iran, thus shutting out British dominance of an industry they had controlled since 1913. That Mosaddeqh had been a democratically-elected leader, with wide popular support fueled resentment at the Shah, who many saw as a brutal puppet for the west. The anger at western intervention stoked strong initial support for the virulently anti-western Ayatollah Khomeini.

Detail of Persepolis, the seat of the Ancient Persian empire. The Arab conquest of Persia led to a an Islamification of Iran but Farsi, the Iranian language, has remained alive. The 11th century poet Ferdowsi, described as 'Iran's Homer', wrote an epic in Farsi which was carefully crafted with minimal Arabic influence. The 'Book of Kings' has been credited with helping preserve the Farsi language - one of the world's oldest. The Book of Kings ends with the Arab invasion, depicted as a disaster for Persia. 'For ordinary Iranians though, the government is a constant embarrassment. 'In the time I spent there I never received anything but goodwill and decency, which stands in clear contrast to my experience in other middle eastern countries.' In one striking image, the tiny village of Palangan in the mountains near the Iraq border can be seen lit up among the hills. Many rural settlements in the country are propped up by government funding with villagers often being paid members of the Basij - whose remit includes prevention of 'westoxification'.

One tourist guide said westerners are scared away by the bloodcurdling rhetoric of a government which is completely out of touch with ordinary Iranians.

Both soldiers were forced to leave the metro at the next station. Their role is to help preserve the Islamic way of life, such as the strict rules on female clothing and the interaction of men and women, which became immersed in Iranian law in the 1979 Islamic revolution. Wearing head coverings is mandatory for women and female police can be seen regularly checking commuters' dress in the city. Chapple said woman are arrested if their dress is considered to be 'immodest'. Other images capture groups of young friends in the hills above the country's capital Tehran who he said were frustrated with the dated regime in the country. Chapple said: 'I found most Iranians - particularly the younger generation - to be very aware of the world around them... with a burning desire for the freedoms they feel they are being denied by an out of touch, ultra-conservative religious elite.'

"Hundreds of people in Philadelphia spent Saturday searching for a college senior who was reported missing after a night out with friends at a crowded bar the night before Thanksgiving.

"Barry Edwards, 44, left his girlfriend with a perforated lung and unable to walk after a nine-hour campaign of violence at her home in Rochdale . A thug who once changed his name to 'Naughty Rascal' tortured his girlfriend for nine hours and threatened to 'break her f****** spine' before beating her so severely she was left unable to walk. Barry Edwards's victim was so traumatised by the ordeal in May last year that she cut her wrists in a suicide bid, Manchester Crown Court was told. The 44-year-old left his victim's blood splattered across the walls of her home in Rochdale and managed to perforate her lung during the sickening attack. In a sadistic game, Edwards also made the woman stand facing a wall, holding a piece of card against it with her nose. He then inflicted more savage beatings on his partner using razor blades and a baseball bat when the card fell to the floor. Edwards has now been jailed for 16 years for the violent attack, which one detective described as the worst case of domestic abuse he had ever seen. The court heard how the abuse only ended when neighbours heard loud banging noises, followed by Edwards threatening to break the woman's spine. The neighbours reported the incident to police, after hearing the victim respond 'Don't Baz, please don't, I don't want to die'. When officers arrived at the home, they discovered blood-stained walls and found the victim unable to walk because her legs had been beaten so badly, the court was told. Paul Hodgkinson, prosecuting, said the woman's face had been slashed with razor blades. Several rolls of tape covered in the victim's blood were also left dotted around the scene. The woman initially claimed her injuries were suffered at the hands of strangers. But she later admitted she had suffered abuse at the hands of Edwards for eight years. The court heard how she told officers she and Edwards - who had previously changed his name to Damian Hayes and Naughty Rascal - began their relationship when he was 36 and she was a teenager. In fits of violence, Edwards would force his partner into a cubby hole beneath the stairs, the court was told. When she crawled out he would throw dumbbells at her, once breaking her arm as she tried to protect herself. His campaign of violence also saw the victim tied-up, beaten with a variety of weapons, slashed with blades and repeatedly kicked in the head. Edwards was jailed at Manchester Crown Court (pictured) for 16 years, after one detective described it as the worst case of domestic abuse he had ever seen . He once turned an aerosol can into a makeshift flamethrower to burn her hair and face, the court was told. Edwards also tried to gouge her eyeballs out with his thumbs and kicked her down the stairs. He had once threatened to throw electrical items into the bathtub while she was in it, the court heard. Edwards, of no fixed address, had pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to grievous bodily harm with intent, two counts of false imprisonment and two counts of threatening to kill. The court heard Edwards had been jailed for nine years in 1994 after torturing another girlfriend. He started seeing that victim after she was released from local authority care as a teenager. He had attacked her with a vegetable knife and killed three cats they owned during their relationship. The girl was so afraid of Edwards that she regularly soiled herself over the terror he inflicted upon her. It culminated in Edwards dragging the girl to an abandoned building site, where he dug a hole and forced his partner to climb in. He then piled bricks on top of her before urinating on the girl's head. He then left her for dead. The girl later escaped and reported the abuse to police. Edwards was given a nine-year prison sentence, which was later reduced to seven on appeal. Sentencing for the latest attack, Judge Mushtaq Khokar said there was a significant risk of reoffending, as the abuse was a carbon copy of the earlier offences. He added: 'I am not surprised she said she wanted to jump out of a window to end it all.' Speaking after the case Detective Constable Russ Clarke said: 'This is one of the most horrendous incidents of domestic abuse I have ever dealt with, leaving the woman with terrible lifelong injuries.' He added: 'It is also my firm view that without a diligent member of the public contacting the police, it is likely this woman would have lost her life. 'I hope this case shows others who may be suffering from domestic abuse that speaking up is the best thing you can do.'","Barry Edwards trapped the woman in her Rochdale home in May last year .

"A racing fan shot himself dead at an NRA-sponsored NASCAR race in Texas last night, it was revealed today. Kirk Franklin, 42, of Saginaw, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after a heated argument in the infield of Texas Motor Speedway, police said. The man and his friends have been watching the NRA500 NASCAR race about 10.30pm when he shot himself. Dead: Kirk Franklin, 42, of Saginaw, died of a 'self-inflicted injury' following a heated argument in the infield of Texas Motor Speedway, pictured, on Saturday night . Police spokeswoman Cpl. Tracey Knight has said alcohol may have been a factor. Track spokesman Mike Zizzo say the death occurred 'in or around a pickup truck' in part of the infield near the middle of the backstretch. Knight said she wasn't sure of Franklin's relationship with others involved in the argument. Several people witnessed the incident, but nobody was in danger, she said. The police official did not elaborate further on the cause of death but said there were no suspects. Emergency vehicles were called to the scene. Alcohol: Alcohol may have been a factor in the incident, which occurred late in the Sprint Cup race, pictured . Police blocked off the area around the incident, and investigators could be seen looking into a truck.

"Anger: Mr Paxman reacted strongly to the Prime Minister's words last year . Jeremy Paxman has launched an attack on the Prime Minister for comparing First World War commemorations to the Diamond Jubilee. The Newsnight host said the Great War should be remembered as a disaster, not ‘an excuse for a knees-up’. He was referring to a speech in which David Cameron promised a ‘truly national commemoration’ to mark 100 years since the outbreak of war in 1914. Mr Cameron added that he wanted ‘a commemoration that, like the Diamond Jubilee celebrations this year, says something about who we are as a people’. But Mr Paxman, whose great uncle died in the War, said: ‘The commemorations should have almost nothing in common with the Diamond Jubilee, which was an excuse for a knees-up in the rain to celebrate the happy fact that our national identity is expressed through a family rather than some politician. 'Personally, I think Elizabeth has played a blinder as queen. But her dull and dutiful grandfather, George V, recognised that the person who should be commemorated at the end of the First World War wasn’t him, but the Unknown Soldier.’ He added: ‘The war was a  disaster which brought stress and grief to most families in the land: there were postboys who gave up their jobs because they couldn’t face the sight  of another mother answering the door and breaking down on receiving the telegram  with the awful news their son was dead.’ The BBC presenter criticised the Prime Minister’s language in this week’s Radio Times. He said: ‘Our Prime Minister promised the First World War commemoration would be “like the Diamond Jubilee celebrations”. What on earth was he talking about?’ 'Hazardous': Mr Paxman criticised many aspects of Mr Cameron's speech at the Imperail War Museum last year, but mainly the decision to compare remebering the  First World War to the Diamond Jubilee . Mr Paxman also disagreed with Mr Cameron’s description of the Imperial War Museum as ‘incredible’. He said: ‘These occasions, when the Prime Minister escapes from his speech-writers, are hazardous. Salvo: Jeremy Paxman launched his attack on David Cameron's language in the upcoming edition of the Radio Times . ‘His address included the cloth-eared ambition to spend lots of public money to make the Imperial War Museum “even more incredible”. ‘The whole point of the place is its awful credibility.’ In his speech, made at the museum last year, Mr Cameron said the centenary would be a ‘personal priority’ and promised the museum £5million. Calling for the nation to remember the ‘extraordinary sacrifice of a generation’, he also said the War helped shape Britain by prompting medical and technological advances. He said: ‘For all the profound trauma, the resilience and courage that was shown, the values we hold dear and the lessons we learnt changed our nation and helped to make us who we are today.’ Mr Paxman said: ‘Not to recognise that it was one  of the most consequential events in our history would just be perverse.’ But he added: ‘A number of distinguished fellow citizens, like the poet laureate Carol Ann Duffy and the thoughtful musician Brian Eno, are worried the events will turn into a “celebration” of war. Only a moron would celebrate war.’ Mr Paxman also criticised the use of Blackadder Goes Forth in school history lessons, saying of the Rowan Atkinson series: ‘It’s great – and moving – comedy. But it’s not fact.’","Jeremy Paxman criticised David Cameron in a Radio Times article .

"In danger: Jyllands Park Zoo say they may now kill their giraffe named Marius (the larger animal pictured) A second Danish zoo has threatened to put down one of its healthy giraffes just days after Copenhagen Zoo slaughtered one to the disgust of animal lovers. Jyllands Park Zoo said it was considering the measure against a giraffe which by coincidence was named Marius like the one killed on Sunday, according to Danish news agency Ritzau. Staff at Copenhagen Zoo have received death treats after the zoo killed the 18-month-old healthy male giraffe because the animal's genes were already well represented in an international breeding programme that aims to maintain a healthy giraffe population in European zoos. Zookeepers at Jyllands Park Zoo said the act is necessary because Marius may fight with a younger male already at the zoo when the female arrives. And they insisted the death threats aimed at staff in Copenhagen would not deter them. Keeper Janni Lojtved Poulsen said: 'We can't have two males and one female. Then there will be fights.' She said that it might be possible to find another place for the giraffe to live, but that the probability is small. Like its namesake in Copenhagen, Jyllands Park Zoo's Marius is considered unsuitable for breeding. 'If the breeding programme coordinator decides that he should be put down, then that's what we'll do,' she said. 'Many places abroad where they do not do this, the animals live under poor conditions, and they are not allowed to breed either. We don't think that's okay.' Scroll down for video .

Poulsen said Jyllands Park Zoo has not yet considered whether it should carry out a public dissection as the one in Copenhagen. Animal rights campaigners dismissed the trend as barbaric. A spokesman for the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) group said: 'As if to ram home the idea that zoos serve no purpose other than to incarcerate intelligent animals so as to turn a profit, a second Danish zoo now proposes to slaughter a giraffe, over the world's objections. 'Zoos spend millions on keeping animals on display like living museum exhibits and dispose of them when they become inconvenient. 'For anyone who cares about giraffes and other individuals serving life sentences in zoos, the giraffe ""culling"" should confirm that zoos are hideous institutions that do not deserve public support.'

"Arsene Wenger believes Roy Hodgson will waste Jack Wilshere’s talent if he continues to play him in a deep midfield role. The Arsenal star earned mixed reviews for playing at the base of a diamond formation on Monday’s 2-0 victory over Switzerland. A paucity of defensive midfield options for both England and Arsenal has led many commentators, including Sportsmail’s Jamie Carragher, to state that Wilshere may be best served tailoring his game for a deeper role. Arsenal manager Wenger thinks differently, however. Jack Wilshere's talent will be wasted if Roy Hodgson continues to play the Arsenal midfielder in a deep role for England, claims Arsene Wenger . ‘I personally prefer Jack Wilshere in a more advanced position than in a deep-lying role as a midfielder,’ he said. ‘If it works [playing deeper], it works and I am very happy for him but I think he is a guy capable of creating danger in the final third. He is provocative in his dribbling and I would like to use this quality.’ Saturday’s lunchtime kick-off against Manchester City marks Bacary Sagna’s return to the Emirates after the France right back left London to join the Premier League champions. For Wenger, his compatriot’s decision to join a Premier League rival when his contract ran out has left a bitter taste. ‘I am sorry he left us because I absolutely tried to keep him. He was a very good player and could cover us in central defence. We lost him. He could have gone even if Man City did not exist, he could have gone somewhere, Italy, anywhere.’ Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger revealed he prefers to play Jack Wilshere in a more advanced midfield role .

"It's a musuem curator's worst nightmare - a priceless antique falls off a table and breaks. But that's what happened at the Spanish Royal Palace in Madrid where an extremely rare Stradivarius cello is reported to have broken while it was being handled by experts during a photoshoot. An official at the palace has confirmed that the hand-crafted instrument, which is thought to be worth in excess of $20million (roughly £13million) has been damaged. Bad note: A priceless Stradivarius cello, similar to the one shown here, worth an estimated $20million was damaged when it fell off a table during a photoshoot at the Royal Palace in Madrid. However they refused to expand further on a report about the unfortunate incident which was printed in the Spanish newspaper El Mundo. The newspaper said the instrument fell off a table during a photo session about three weeks ago, but exactly how it happened is yet to be confirmed. Considered the best stringed instruments ever made, Stradivarius' cellos, violins lutes, mandolins, guitars and harps were all handcrafted by Antonio Stradivari in 17th and 18th century Italy.Stradivari designed and crafted more than 1,000 and other instruments during his lifetime, many of which still exist today. They are considered the finest instruments ever made and continue to be the standard in form, sound and beauty. The earliest known Stradivarius violin was made in 1666, when Stradivari was only 22-years-old. During his golden period, Stradivari created violins whose sound boxes are unmatched even today. Stradivari continued to craft unmatched instruments into his late 70s. As he grew older his work appears slightly less immaculate than his earlier creations. However, he continued to handcraft instruments until his death in 1737. Today, artisans and scientists still try to recreate what can only be the beauty and sound of a Stradivarius instrument. They are prized possessions housed in museums and personal collections around the world. But some of the details about the damage the instrument sustained have been revealed. A piece which joins the neck of the 17th century cello to its body broke and fell off. The broken piece was not original but rather a replacement installed in the 19th century. The official said the cello can and will be repaired, but the cost of this work and the breakage's impact on the instrument's value is not clear. The official said it was part of a set of instruments which also included two violins and a viola which are together known as 'The Quartet'. The cello is one of five antique instruments made by Italian Antonio Stradivari, renowned for the exquisite sound of his instruments, that were acquired by king Felipe V who ruled Spain at the turn of the 18th century. The instruments were given the quartet name because they were commissioned at the same time. Tim Ingles, head of the musical instrument department at Sotheby's auction house in London, placed the  $20 million price tag on the instrument. Of the approximately 1100 legendary stringed instruments Stradivari made, only around 650 remain, including an estimated nine violas and 50 cellos. Only the best musicians have had the honour of playing them.","Instrument is part of an antique quartet housed at the Royal Palace in Madrid .

"Campaigners are desperate to find a herd for an orphaned Indian elephant who has spent most of her 39 years alone in zoos. Tania was just three years old when the rest of her herd was wiped out in 1978, and she has since been moved from zoo to zoo across Europe, isolated and showing signs of distress. After stints in France, Spain and Italy, she has been at Romania's Târgu Mureș Zoo in the city of the same name, in what campaigners say, has been a cramped enclosure surrounded by the sounds of building work. Scroll down for video . The lonely elephant: Tania, aged 39, has been shunted from zoo to zoo for most of her life without any company . Campaign: Animal activists want Tania, pictured at Târgu Mures Zoo in Romania, to be moved to a sanctuary . Almost 70,000 people signed a petition in November last year calling on zoo officials, EU member states and the mayor of Târgu Mureș to allow Tania to be released into a sanctuary. Born into the wild, she would normally be a highly social animal and rights campaigners say she may not survive much longer after being starved of the company of her own kind for decades. Activists say her enclosure in Romania was not ready when she arrived, and she had to be kept in a . tiny cage until it was finished with the noise from the building work as a . constant distraction. Instead of being placed with other elephants after her family died, Tania was sold to the Plaisance-du-Touch zoo near Toulouse, south west France, where she remained isolated for around a quarter of a century. In 2004 Tania was moved to the Terra Natura zoo in Benidorm, Spain, where she was temporarily placed with another female elephant, Khaiso, who also had a difficult past. The two quickly became inseparable. Dank: Tania the Indian elephant's current enclosure is said to be woefully inadequate, with activists saying the stress of being in tight captivity and deprived of the company of other elephants is causing stress . Shocking: Tania is kept behind red metal bars in her fourth zoo to call home in the last 10 years . Mud bath: Elephants are usually very sociable creatures with a deep understanding for other herd members . But when the zoo got into financial difficulties she was again sold off, and in 2009 was taken to Le Barben zoo in France, whose herd did not accept her so she was moved in 2011 to Le Cornelle near Milan, Italy - where the same thing happened. Finally she ended up where she is now, where campaigners say she has been for more than a year. Indian elephants can live for up to 60 or 70 years. Roberta Brown, one of the activists behind the campaign, said: 'Elephants are highly sociable beings, with very strong ties to their families. Losing her family and then being isolated must've had a devastating effect on Tania. 'Elephants are traditionally pack animals with close family ties but Tania lives all alone in the Romanian zoo where her conditions are inappropriate to say the least. Animal rights campaigner Roberta Brown said: 'She is showing signs of severe stress and has a damaged foot which is in need of treatment. She is seen swaying and rubbing her head against the side of the enclosure' No friends: After years of isolation Tania may have forgotten how to socialise and was rejected later on . 'She is showing signs of severe stress and has a damaged foot which is in need of treatment. She is often seen swaying from side to side and also seen rubbing her head against her enclosure which are both signs of distress in elephants. 'The floor has no drainage, and Tania has to stay with her ill feet in her own urine and faeces. 'She has had a life of misery and neglect, and to give her one last chance of some happiness at the end of days and after all she has gone through.' A reporter contacted the zoo over the allegations but the director was unavailable for comment.

"Death: Martin Hadfield (pictured with his mother Annie O'Gorman) failed to get responses on almost every job application over a three-month period . A young gardener who was ‘too proud’ to claim benefits killed himself after unsuccessfully applying for 40 . jobs in three months, his devastated family said yesterday. Martin . Hadfield was left ‘demoralised’ and ‘with no self-worth’ after hours . filling in forms at his local Job Centre turned out to be in vain. His . family said the ‘industrious and hardworking’ 20-year-old lost hope . after he was repeatedly passed over in favour of younger applicants . prepared to work for less. Although . youth unemployment is now falling, Mr Hadfield’s family said they . wanted him to be remembered as more than a statistic – and appealed for . other young jobseekers in his situation to be treated with a ‘human . touch’ rather than facing red tape and bureaucracy. ‘Martin . was the kind of guy who was industrious but too proud to tell us if . anything was wrong,’ his stepfather Peter O’Gorman, 47, said after an . inquest into Mr Hadfield’s death. Describing . how his stepson ‘hated’ going into the Job Centre, he added: ‘Many . people go in with a sense of self-worth – they really do want a job – . but come out feeling demoralised and put down.’ Mr . Hadfield had worked for his stepfather’s car valeting business after . his GCSEs before getting a job as a landscape gardener and achieving NVQ . qualifications. But in . April last year he lost his job when the firm downsized. He . unsuccessfully applied for 40 posts over the next three months – and . most of these applications went ignored because he was ‘undercut’ on . wages by younger and less experienced candidates. Just . 24 hours after his last Job Centre appointment in July – which simply . resulted in an invitation to a ‘follow-up’ meeting – he was found hanged . at his flat in Tottington, Greater Manchester. ‘On . the day he died, his mum gave him some money for the bus home and . instead he walked the five miles home and saved it for something . important,’ his stepfather said. 'Became a statistic': Mr Hadfield was 'undercut' on wages by younger and more inexperienced candidates . ‘That . was the kind of boy he was, hardworking and with so much potential. Martin never claimed any money or benefits in his life. He got nothing . off the government and was proud not to.’ His . mother Annie O’Gorman, 50, a former prison officer, said: ‘Martin was . just a regular boy and he just didn’t think to talk to someone about . what he was going through. It was just a tragic moment of madness.’ Mr O’Gorman said his stepson’s experience of constantly attending the Job Centre had been ‘demoralising’. 'Demoralising': Just 24 hours after a meeting where staff a the Jobcentre Plus in Bury (pictured) invited him to a 'follow up' meeting, he was found hanged at his flat . Younger days: Mr Hadfield (pictured above in his earlier years) left school with GCSEs and - after helping his stepfather valet cars - got a job at as a landscape gardener and achieved National Vocational Qualifications . There were 5,981 suicides in the UK in 2012 - 77 per cent of which were men, according to statistics published by the Samaritans charity. This total figure was down slightly from 6,045 in 2011, but up significantly from 5,608 in 2010.

"Though it was a sex tape with Ray J that made Kim Kardashian famous, similar videos co-starring Whitney Houston would only diminish her legacy. The deceased singer reportedly made 'a ton' of sexually explicit videos and took several sexy snaps with her younger lover. Now, according to Star, the Houston family has been in contact with the 31-year-old, begging him not to release the racy material. Sex tape scandal; Ray J is reportedly in possession of 'a ton' of sexually explicit media featuring the late Whitney Houston . A source tells the magazine that the . Houstons have 'been in contact with Ray and told him they do not want . any photos or videos painting her in a bad light to come out.' The family 'explained to Ray that now is the time to honour Whitney, not drag her legacy down.' Star magazine reports the R&B singer is conflicted about what to do with alleged tapes. He's been 'stalling' to sell, knowing . that though he's 'sitting on a gold mine' he should most likely hand . them over to her family. However a spokesman for Ray J has since come forward to deny the reports. In it together: The couple reportedly dated until Houston's death at the age of 48 on February 11 . Scandal number two: A sex tape featuring Ray J and ex Kim Kardashian was released in 2007 . Courtney Barnes, spokesman for Ray J told Mail Online: . 'The despicable tabloid report released today claiming the existence of a . sex tape between Ray J and Whitney Houston is not true,' adding: 'There is no . sex tape.' Before adding categorically: 'This story along with so many others have been released to sell magazines. There is no sex tape or explicit photos.' According to Star magazine, Whitney, who died at the age of 48 on February 11, would have done anything for her toyboy. She reportedly 'loved doting on him and would have done anything he asked - including making a sex tape.' The two are said to have dated for the last several years leading up until the time of her death. Born William Ray Norwood, the singer songwriter is most famous for launching Kim Kardashian's career. He did so via - of course - co-starring in a sex tape with the now super famous reality star. The two dated in 2003, and in 2007, a racy video the two made was leaked. Kim sued Vivid Entertainment for ownership of the tape, but later dropped the suit and settled for $5 million.",Ray J spokesman refutes allegations .
"They have become one of Britain's best loved gardens, complete with fountains, a Christmas orchard and an array of topiary. But now, the Laskett Gardens in Much Birch, Herefordshire, will be destroyed after the National Trust said it would not preserve them because they were not important enough. Sir Roy Strong, a former director of the National Portrait Gallery and the Victoria and Albert Museum, was so upset by the decision he decided he will not keep the garden open. Scroll down for video . Sir Roy Strong (pictured) created Laskett Gardens with his wife and hoped to leave them to the National Trust but it said they were not important or historical enough to preserve . Sir Roy and his late wife Julia Trevelyan Oman spent more than 30 years transforming a field beside their home in Much Birch, in Herefordshire into the largest private formal gardens to be created in England since 1945 . Sir Roy is so upset by the National Trust snub that he now plans to have the gardens 'destroyed' when he dies . Sir Roy designed Laskett, the largest private formal gardens to be created in England since 1945, with his late wife Julia Trevelyan Oman, a theatrical set designer. He began talks about leaving them to the trust three years ago, but he received a letter last month saying the offer had been rejected. 'The letter stated that the gardens did not reach the high rung of historical and national importance', Sir Roy told the Sunday Times. 'I'm so upset now that I have decided to change my will, stating that the garden will stay open to the public for one year after my death, and then be destroyed.' He added: 'Not bulldozed as such, but I will ensure that all the personal aspects which really make the garden so extraordinary are taken away. 'It would be insulting to the memory of myself and Julia to continue to leave so many things which were dear to us if they are not going to be looked after by the trust.' The gardens have been open to the public for two days a week since 2010 and visits are over subscribed . Sir Roy said: 'We married late. I was 35 and Julia 40. In a sense, the garden became the children we never had' While Sir Roy has decided to leave 60 volumes of archives about the gardens to Oxford University's Bodleian Library, the gardens will be lost . Trevelyan Oman died from pancreatic cancer in 2003. Sir Roy said: 'We married late. I was 35 and Julia 40. In a sense, the garden became the children we never had. 'The Laskett in Herefordshire was purchased as our home, and there was little or no garden. But there was a four-acre field attached to it that was let to a farmer for his cattle. 'Julia was already a gardener, and within weeks I became one, too, but the turning point came in 1974, when the farmer didn’t want the field for his stock any more. 'So we began to plant our yew hedges and trees, to make borders and plant an orchard.' Combining their prodigious talents, the couple spent the next 30 years transforming the field in to formal gardens with a rose garden, pleached lime avenue, kitchen garden and fountains. The gardens also contain a temple dedicated to the Victoria and Albert Museum, an arbour in honour of Sir Frederick Ashton, the Royal Ballet choreographer with whom Trevelyan Oman regularly worked and a sundial from the estate of the photographer Sir Cecil Beaton. They have been open to the public for two days a week since 2010 and visits are over subscribed. It has been described by Stephen Lacey as 'one of the most important and interesting gardens in the 20th century.' Sir Roy and Trevelyan Oman spent more than 30 years transforming a field beside their home in Much Birch, Herefordshire . Sir Roy, pictured in his garden in 1993, had hoped to leave them to the National Trust as they would then be seen by many more people . Dame Helen Ghosh, the former civil servant who was appointed director general of the National Trust in 2012, sent a letter last month to Sir Roy explaining the decision . Sir Roy has decided to leave 60 volumes of archives about the gardens to Oxford University's Bodleian Library . In a book published last year, Sir Roy wrote: 'The Laskett Gardens are unashamedly nostalgic and romantic and they are emphatically the creation of a marriage of equals...I know of no other English garden that resonates so forcefully with the lives of its two makers' In response, the National Trust said: 'We were approached by Roy Strong to leave us Laskett Gardens in his will. 'This was a very generous offer but when offered such a gift, our board of trustees considers it against strict acquisition criteria. 'This includes making an assessment of the place's national and historical significance. 'We believe the establishment of an independent charitable trust would be the best way to protest this much-loved place.' Sir Roy became assistant keeper of the National Portrait Gallery in 1959, and became its youngest director in 1967, when he was only 32, a position he held for six years. In 1973, aged 38, he became the youngest director of the Victoria and Albert Museum (V&A), London. He was in that post until his resignation in 1987 to pursue a freelance career in the media and as a writer and consultant. He was knighted in 1983. Over the years he has written extensively on the country's history and culture as well as on garden design. His more recent books include The Laskett, The Story of a Garden, Coronation, A Little History of the English Country Church and Visions of England. He has lived in Herefordshire since 1973-74 and he and his wife conceived the Laskett garden in autumn 1974.

"Cash migration: The money is sent to families in Poland, Ireland, France, Slovakia and many other nations . Britain is giving EU immigrants £1million a week in handouts for children who live abroad. The payments include child benefit – which was stripped from more than one million British families last month. The bill is likely to rise still further when Romanians and Bulgarians get free access to the UK jobs market on January 1. Critics said it was ‘absurd’ to carry on sending money to countries such as Poland when families were losing out at home. Overall, there are 24,082 child benefit awards currently being made, in respect of 40,171 children, according to a study. EU citizens are also pocketing child tax credits on behalf of youngsters who are living overseas. It costs the taxpayer an astonishing £55million a year to fund this system, which is only replicated in four other EU countries. The other 22 nations require the child to be resident in order to qualify. UK payments relate to cases where migrants have moved to Britain, but left their children at home. When they arrive in the UK, they register with HM Revenue & Customs for the benefit. The money is then paid direct to them, so it can be sent home. The children do not have to live in the UK or even have visited. Migrants choose to claim the money from the UK government – rather than in equivalent schemes at home – because the payments are much higher. In Poland, child benefit is around £5 a week. In Britain, it is £20.30 a week for the first child and £13.40 for every other child. Two-thirds of the children – 25,659 – for whom child benefit is paid are based in Poland. Child benefit paid for children living overseas costs the taxpayer £36.6million per year, while child tax credit costs £18.6million per year. A town on the outskirts of Sofia, Bulgaria. Bulgaria and Romania are relatively poor, and families will be attracted to the UK for jobs and benefits . The figures emerged in a report by . the campaign group Migrationwatch, which was based on Treasury figures . given in a parliamentary written answer. Last night, chairman Sir Andrew Green said: ‘It is absurd that child benefit is paid to children who do not even live in the UK. 'At a time that UK taxpayers are being asked to tighten their belts, the Government is paying out over £1million per week to support children in other countries where costs are, in any case, often much lower. The report will re-ignite anger over the Government's cuts to child benefit. ‘The majority of EU countries have the good sense to ensure that the child in question must be resident in that country in order to qualify and it is about time the UK did the same.’ The report will re-ignite anger over the Government’s cuts to child benefit. Ministers ruled that any family in which one person earns over £60,000 should lose the payment altogether, while they are cut on a sliding scale for those earning between £50,000 and £60,000. But families in which two earners both receive up to £50,000 did not lose out. Critics said it penalised the traditional family, where one parent stays at home to raise children. In Opposition, the Tories wanted to end the payments to migrants, but they have carried on paying the benefit while in power. The party’s then Treasury spokesman, Philip Hammond, said in 2009: ‘With Britain facing a debt crisis and the Government’s child poverty strategy in tatters, it beggars belief that Gordon Brown is continuing to send millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money to children who don’t even live in this country.’ From the end of this year, almost 30million residents from the two former Eastern Bloc countries will be entitled to live and work freely in the UK. Any migrant who moves here from either country will be entitled to claim child benefit and child tax credits. Treasury Minister Sajid Javid said Britain was obliged to pay child tax benefit and child tax credit under EU regulations.","Cash is awarded despite the children living in another country .

"The elderly, former KKK leader charged with shooting dead three people at Jewish community centers was pen pals with fellow white supremacist bomber Kevin Harpham, it was revealed today. Harpham is serving 32 years for the failed bombing of the MLK Day parade in Spokane, Washington in 2011. Frazier Glenn Cross, aka Glenn Miller, 73, has been charged with three counts of murder following the Kansas City shooting spree on Sunday that left a 14-year-old boy, his . grandfather and a 53-year-old woman dead. Scroll down for video . Kevin Harpham (left) is serving 32 years for the failed bombing of the . MLK Day parade in Spokane, Washington in 2011. It was revealed that he . had received fan mail from Frazier Glenn Cross (right) Prosecutors investigating Cross said that the pair sent each other letters and postcards in 2011, according to ABC News. In a letter, Cross told Harpham to 'stay strong' and offered to set up a legal defense fund as he appeared to believe that Harpham was innocent. Harpham wrote back to Cross saying that he did not need money for a legal team but added that he may need him to house-sit. The failed bomber also complained about his conditions in jail where there was a 'hard bed, limited clothing and blankets to keep . warm'. A postcard that Frazier Glenn Cross, aka Glenn Miller, sent failed Spokane bomber Kevin Harpham in 2011, urging him to 'stay strong' Harpham sent a letter in reply to Cross, thanking him for the offer of fundraising and saying he had plenty of reading materials . On January 17, 2011, two days before the annual celebration of one of America's greatest icons of peace and equality, Martin Luther King, a bomb was found in the small city of Spokane, Washington. The radio-controlled pipe bomb was placed along the route of the MLK memorial march. It was filled with metal shrapnel and rat poison to prevent bleeding wounds from coagulating, thus intended to inflict maximum damage indiscriminately on the crowd. Thankfully, the device, left in a backpack, was intercepted and defused by bomb disposal experts. It was sent to FBI HQ for further analysis and a $20,000 reward offered for the culprits. The timing and location of the bomb led investigators to believe that the attack was racially motivated. On March 9, the FBI arrested white supremacist Kevin William Harpham, 36, of Addy, Washington. He was sentenced that December to 32 years in prison for the attempted bombing. Harpham was sentenced to 32 years  in . 2011 for the attempted bombing. Harpham, then 36, had planted a . radio-controlled pipe bomb filled with a rat-poison chemical and . shrapnel along the route of the Martin Luther King Jr. memorial march. Cross appeared in court on Tuesday to be charged with capital murder for the deaths of Dr William Lewis Corporon, 69, and his grandson Reat Griffin Underwood, . 14. Cross also faces one count of . first-degree, premeditated murder for the death of Terri LaManno  who was . gunned down while visiting her mother at a nearby retirement complex. None of Sunday's victims were Jewish: . Dr Corporon and his grandson were at the community center for a singing . contest audition, while Ms LaManno was visiting her mother at the . retirement . complex. Separate hate crime charges are expected to be filed later. He is being held on $10million bond. Cross, a former Vietnam veteran, founded the Carolina Knights of the Ku Klux . Klan in his native North Carolina and later the White Patriot Party. After a 1986 contempt-of-court conviction . in North Carolina for operating a paramilitary camp, Cross went in . hiding while free on bond and fled to Missouri. There, federal agents found him and . several other men in a rural mobile home stocked with hand grenades, . automatic weapons and thousands of bullets. Bomb disposal experts work on the explosive device which was rendered inert after being found at the MLK parade in Spokane, Washington in 2011 . Hateful: Cross, pictured, appeared to target Jews but none of his victims in fact belonged to the faith . Cross, 73, was arrested on Sunday following the two attacks in Kansas City that left three dead . Cross entered federal witness protection programs in 1987, according to The Wall Street Journal, and agreed to cooperate with authorities. It is not clear when the protection ended. Indicted on weapons charges and accused of plotting robberies and the assassination of SPLC founder Morris Dees, Cross served three years in federal prison but avoided a longer sentence in exchange for testifying against more than a dozen other KKK leaders. 'We were aware he was affiliated with certain hate groups,' FBI special agent Michael Kaste said at a Monday press conference. Federal prosecutors say there's enough evidence to warrant putting the case before a grand jury as a hate crime. Moving the case from state to federal prosecutors would likely mean tougher punishments if Cross is convicted. 'The motivation behind these attacks . was a hate crime... He was trying to hurt someone based on race or . ethnicity,’ FBI agent Kaste said at a Monday press conference. Before . the shootings, Cross had been contemptuous of some of his like-minded . allies' reliance on social media over violent confrontation. 'He . felt it was easy to be a 'keyboard commando,' but that the only way . activists will ever succeed is by going out on the streets,' said Devin . Burghart, the vice president of the Institute for Research & . Education on Human Rights. Victims: Dr. William Lewis Corporan, and his grandson Reat Griffin Underwood (left) were at the Jewish Community Center for a singing competition while Terri LaManno (right) was visiting her mother at a Jewish assisted living facility. None of the victims were Jewish . Burghart said his group made a . presentation on white supremacists to the Jewish Community Center in . August, a discussion that included a description of Cross as an example . of dangerous anti-Semitic figures in the region. It wasn't clear what, if any, steps were taken by the center to act on the information. The timing of the attack is worth . noting, as a group monitoring anti-Semitic attacks in the U.S. cautiously reported a sharp decline in such incidents less than two . weeks before this weekend’s attack. In . a report April 1, the Anti-Defamation League noted a 19 per cent drop . in anti-Semitic incidents last year compared to 2012, part of what the . group called a 'decade-long downward slide' and one of its lowest . tallies since it started keeping such records in 1979.

"For 21 years, fans wanting to pay their respects at Freddie Mercury’s last resting place have had nowhere to go. The singer was cremated after he died of Aids in 1991 but the whereabouts of his ashes remained unknown. Now fans believe a plaque spotted at a West London cemetery over the weekend could solve the mystery. Mystery: Freddie (left) was cremated after his death in 1991 but it is not known where they were scattered. Fans hope the tribute plaque discovered at London's Kensal Green Cemetery (right) could hold the answer . Final resting place? Dates on the memorial plaque thought to relate to the Queen singer (pictured centre) match his birth and death . Plaque: Farrokh Bulsara was Freddie's real name, and the French message translates as 'always to be close to you with all my love'. 'M' could relate to his former girlfriend Mary Austin who lived in London . The plaque is in place at Kensal Rise . cemetery and dedicated to Farrokh Bulsara,  Mercury’s birth name. He . became Freddie Mercury after forming Queen in 1971. The French tribute to the great lead singer in Kensal Green Cemetery may be the clue fans have been searching for, because the dates engraved on it match those of his life and staff did not know it was there. The small plaque sits on a tall plinth among tributes to other individuals and reads: 'In Loving Memory of Farrokh Bulsara. Pour Etre Toujours Pres De Toi Avec Tout Mon Amour'. This translates as 'Always To Be Close To You With All My Love' and is signed off with a letter 'M'. The M could stand for his former . girlfriend Mary Austin, who received his £7million home Garden Lodge, an . eight-bedroom property in Kensington, London. A statement on the  Kensal Green Cemetery's website says plaques like these 'can be provided for those whose cremated remains have been strewn in the Scattering Garden'. Clue: The plaque is a significant find in the west London cemetery (pictured) that contains other famous people including William Makepeace Thackeray and Anthony Trollope . Success: Freddie Mercury's band, which included celebrated guitarist Brian May, sold 300million records and the lead singer was a worldwide icon . The only one: Freddie's former girlfriend and life-long friend Mary (pictured in 1984) was the one who took possession of his ashes after the cremation . A spokesman for Mercury's estate refused to comment but fans believe this could be a discovery they have waited decades for. 'Everyone knows Freddie was cremated at Kensal Green Cemetery in 1991 but it has remained a . complete mystery as to where his ashes were finally laid to rest', one told the Daily Mirror. 'According to some biographies, his ashes weren’t even collected from Kensal Green for well over a year following his cremation. 'The discovery of this plaque is really exciting and may prove to be a major breakthrough.' Partner: Freddie Mercury and his love Jim Hutton, who believed that the singer's ashes had been scattered by a tree in his Kensington garden . At the heart of this latest twist appears to be Mary Austin, who the bisexual vocalist called his 'wife', and who inherited a great deal of his wealth. She also received his song rights, which continue to make huge sums, because Queen sold 300 million albums round the world and had a number of huge-selling number one singles like Bohemian Rhapsody. The singer's former partner, Jim Hutton, said in a 1994 interview he believed that Freddie's ashes were buried at Garden Lodge, adding: 'It’s become something of a riddle but I’m pretty sure his final resting place is at the foot of the weeping cherry tree overlooking the whole place.' But there have long been strong rumours that his remains may actually have been scattered on Zanzibar, the paradise island he was born on off Tanzania or on the shore of Lake Geneva, in Montreux, where he had a home.","Plaque with French tribute to star has been found in Kensal Green Cemetery .

"A World War One trench system covering an area the size of two football fields could be built in the English countryside. Proposals for a 'living museum' in Cambridgeshire would see over half a mile of both British and German trenches, complete with their own no-man's land, built just off the A14. The National Centre for the Great War would also have nine training huts and would allow schoolchildren to visit and experience the day-to-day life of soldiers during the 1914-1918 conflict. Dr Tony Cooke has submitted plans for this museum in Cambridge which would see over half a mile of trenches and nine training huts built just off of the A14 due to open in August 2014 to make the centenary of the Great War . The trenches and training huts - both Allied and German - would be built to authentic plans with minor adjustments to make them safe for the public . If proposals go ahead visitors would be  dressed in replica World War I uniforms and allowed to hold replica weapons, then guided through the site by historical experts and re-enactors. The site will even feature a tank - which is currently parked on founder Dr Tony Cooke's driveway - and a miniature railway. Dr Cooke, a biologist and amateur historian, said: 'The Great War has now moved into history. There are no survivors of the Great War left, so you can't go and talk to those guys anymore. 'We are stewards for this history and we need to pass that on to the next generation.' Dr Tony Cooke is a biologist and amateur historian who has a replica WWI tank on his driveway . This tank will form part of the 'living museum' which would allow visitors a glimpse into the everyday lives of soldiers during the conflict . It will be the only one of its kind in Britain and the most extensive in . Western Europe, and could be open as early as August next year, in time . for the centenary of the start of the Great War. The project has taken four years of research and planning to get to this point, and will cost £2million, all of it privately funded. The trenches and training huts will all be based on actual plans from German and British military manuals from the time, with minor alterations to make them safer. Dr Cooke added: 'Existing trenches are nicely grassed over and have pretty gardens attached so for someone going to the Western Front it is difficult to imagine what a trench was like. 'We looked at sites in France and Belgium but planning applications were so onerous it could've taken 20 years. 'We decided the best place was in Britain to provide a place for children who cannot afford to go to the Western Front. 'The Government has put aside money to send children there, but it is only enough for two children and one teacher from each state school. We wanted to provide another option.' British troops suffered through the war in terrible conditions in makeshift trenches that stretched from Belgium to Switzerland . There are no survivors left from the Great War so it is up to the next generation to keep the history alive and make sure the soldiers are remembered . It is hoped up to 300,000 visitors would flock to the museum annually, making it a viable business which will not use any public funding. Dr Cooke said he and his co-founder, Kevin Jepson, decided not to use public money as it is already stretched  between other projects. The museum will also feature exhibits documenting local WWI history, including the lives of famous figures from Cambridge University who fought in the conflict, such as poet Sigfried Sassoon. The University held a unique place in the history of the War as it had students serve as officers on both German and Allied sides. Allied troops, like these French grenadiers, lived, fought and died in huge trench systems dug during WWI . After the Battle of the Marne in September, 1914, the German army was forced to retreat to the River Aisne. The commander decided that his troops must at all costs hold onto those parts of France and Belgium that they still occupied. The men were ordered to dig trenches that would provide them with protection from the advancing French and British troops. The Allies soon realised that they could not break through this line and they also began to dig. After a few months these trenches had spread from the North Sea to the Swiss Frontier. As the Germans were the first to build, they had been able to choose the best places. The possession of the higher ground not only gave the Germans a tactical advantage, but it forced the British and French to live in the worst conditions. Most of this area was rarely a few feet above sea level. As soon as soldiers began to dig down they would invariably find water two or three feet below the surface. Water-logged trenches were a constant problem for soldiers on the Western Front leading to the spread of lice and so-called 'trench foot', where constantly soaking boots lead to soldiers feet literally rotting off the bone. It would take the loss of millions of lives and the invention of the tank by the British army before the formidable system was finally broken four years after it was built.","Over half a mile of Allied and German trenches to be built in Cambridge .

"Talks aimed at resolving the London Underground ticket office dispute are to be held before a fresh round of strikes is due to be launched. The conciliation service Acas said all parties involved in the row will meet on Friday. The news was announced as members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union continued a 48-hour strike which has led to travel disruption across the capital for a second day. The walkout will end at 9pm tonight and is due to be followed by a three-day strike from 9pm next Monday unless there is a breakthrough to the deadlocked row over the closure of Tube ticket offices. Travellers struggled through a second day of disruption in London today as a row over how effective the strike had been flared between RMT and London Underground (LU). Commuters at Earl's Court struggle through another day of transport chaos thanks to the RMT walkout . Passengers on a Tube train had to budge up this morning as a limited service meant crowded trains . With fewer trains operating, there was a longer wait for a Tube train - and a crush when one did turn up . Commuters at Victoria lined the street by the bus stops as they struggled to get to work this morning . More disruption: The RMT's Tube strike entered its second day today - but all Tube lines were running . Queues: Commuters faced a long wait for a bus at London Bridge station this morning on day two of the strike . London Underground said most Tube stations were open and half the trains running - but the RMT disagreed . LU said it was running 52 per cent of Tube services today despite the 'pointless' strike, and carried 56 per cent of its usual passenger numbers this morning, which it said was a record for a strike day. Around 80 per cent of stations were open and services ran on 10 of the 11 lines, said the company. Nearly 90 per cent of the usual number of . Oyster cards were used on Transport for London's network yesterday, . according to the company. But . the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, which organised the 48-hour . walkout, accused LU of 'misleading' the public over the level of . services, and of leaving platforms and stations 'dangerously . overcrowded.' The RMT, which will end the protest over planned ticket office closures at . 9pm tonight, with a further three-day stoppage planned for next week, insisted the strike remained 'rock solid'. This morning queues built up outside Tube stations, many of which opened at 7am, with further queues at bus stops and taxi ranks across the city.  Meanwhile others took to two wheels to get to work, leaving Boris bike stands empty. But unlike yesterday, not one Tube line was completely closed early this morning, and many found it easier to get into work than expected. Crush: Trains were running on all lines today but commuters faced a squash to get on as services were restricted . Commuters this morning either faced a long wait for a bus, left, or getting on a Boris bike... if they could find one . No go: Many Tube stations remained closed early this morning before opening and running a limited service . Routemaster: Vintage buses have been brought back into service to help transport Londoners . Mike . Brown, managing director of London Underground, said adequate services . were running on the transport network, where all 11 lines were open, and . said 15 per cent more staff worked yesterday than during the previous . strike. He also vowed that today's service would be an improvement on yesterday's. He said: 'I'm sorry that . Londoners are enduring more disruption today as a result of the RMT's . pointless strike action. 'The only sensible course is for the RMT . leadership to call off the strikes and get back to working with us to . shape the future of the Tube, as the other three unions are doing. 'It was tough for our customers . yesterday, but with more staff arriving for work than during the last . strike in February, we were able to run 50 per cent of the train service and . keep two-thirds of stations open. 'Nearly 90 per cent of the normal number of . Oyster cards were used yesterday; we will be working really hard again . to further improve this level of service.' He . appealed for fresh talks with the RMT, adding: 'Under our plans to modernise the . Tube, we are committed to a safe railway with visible staff personally . serving our passengers.' Mr Brown said there would be no compulsory redundancies, . and said LU had drastically altered their original proposals 'after listening to our people and the unions in over 40 meetings'. He added: 'The . RMT leadership know the real motivations behind their action, but it is . infuriating that London's commuters and businesses are the ones who are . being forced to pay the price with this unnecessary disruption.' Ticket barriers at Waterloo station were thronged with commuters today as the second day of the strike began . Commuters used Barclays 'Boris' bikes to get to work today - ranks across London were emptied early . Bakerloo: Trains between Queen's Park and Elephant & Castle only . Central: Trains between Epping and Leytonstone, Woodford to Hainault, Hainault to Marble Arch, and White City to Ealing Broadway, and West Ruislip to North Acton . Circle: Trains between Hammersmith and Aldgate only . District: Trains between Upminster and Wimbledon, Ealing Broadway and High St Kensington, and Edgware Road and Wimbledon only . Hammersmith & City: Trains between Edgware Road and Barking . All the Tube lines were running, with some offering a normal service and others a reduced service today . Jubilee: Trains running on the whole line but with reduced frequency . Metropolitan: Trains between Amersham and Baker Street, Uxbridge and Harrow-on-the-Hill, and Harrow-on-the-Hill and Aldgate only . Piccadilly: Trains between Hammersmith and Heathrow T123, and Arnos Grove and Cockfosters only . Waterloo & City: Trains running earlier but now closed . DLR: Good service . London Overground: No service between Richmond and Willesden Junction while a signal failure is mended at South Acton . Northern: Good service . Victoria: Trains between Walthamstow Central and Seven Sisters and between Seven Sisters and Brixton . The RMT's acting general secretary, Mick Cash, said: 'It helps no-one for LU to deliberately mislead the public as to what services are available as it simply piles dangerous levels of pressure onto the ghost trains and skeleton operations, leaving passengers and staff at risk. 'You cannot turn the crucial issue of Tube safety into a high-risk PR stunt designed to do nothing more than prop up the political position and cuts agenda of this Government and London's Tory mayor. 'Instead of producing bogus timetables, Tube chiefs should be around the table responding positively to RMT's proposals for resolving a dispute which is about nothing more than cash-led cuts to jobs, services and safety.' Crowds: Commuters using overground train services wait to pass through the barriers at Waterloo station . More crowds at Waterloo wait after getting off an overground train - the strike is due to end at 9pm tonight . A second day of Tube strikes meant more misery for commuters - crowds formed at London Bridge station . This vintage AET Regent III RT bus was among several old buses brought into use to help during the strike . The Waterloo & City line was open for rush-hour but then closed, while all other lines were running. Meanwhile, a spokesman for Heathrow Express said it was transporting its usual daily volume of 17,000 people between the airport and London Paddington, despite an RMT strike in a separate dispute which was reducing its available workforce by two-thirds. Mayor Boris Johnson said: 'The idea that this is a solidly supported strike is farcical. This action is the result of a minority of just one union, the RMT, who are refusing to see the logic of what we are trying to achieve.' Yesterday Conservative vice-party chairman Bob Neill said: 'The RMT, who have been used to trying to hold London to ransom for a long time, don’t have the clout they used to think they have. ‘Londoners have voted with their feet and their Oysters cards and that’s a big wake-up call for the RMT.' Meanwhile, a cafe has been criticised after putting a sandwich board outside banning members of the RMT. Grill Market, in Holborn, north London, came under fire when a picture of the board, which also announced a discount for everybody not on strike, was posted on Twitter. The sign read: 'No RMT Members. 10% off coffee for everyone else.' A sign outside the Grill Market cafe in north London saying 'No RMT members' which has been criticised by some Londoners . Cass Horowitz tweeted a picture of the board with the caption: 'Saw this on the way to work? good to know London still has a sense of humour.' But many angry Londoners failed to see the funny side. While the manager of the eatery was quick to apologise for the sign and remove it, many angry Londoners vented their frustration at them online. The manager tweeted: 'Again, total apology to anyone offended by the board this morning. Was only supposed to be a joke, clearly I got it VERY wrong.' Despite the apology, dozens of people slammed the joke. SeymourSan tweeted: 'How about an apology to those who's plight you belittled rather than an apology to all the people your boss saw you upset?' Twitter user Hayrr added: 'I don't accept your apology. Offer a discount to the picketers.' Alexeptable added: 'How could it be a joke in any way, shape or form? Do you know how jokes work?'","Londoners face second day of Tube walkout as RMT union members strike .

"Flag row: The Department for Culture, Media and Sport backtracked after telling a town hall they could not fly the Union Flag at half mast (file picture) It was to be a poignant gesture at a vigil to mark 100 years since the start of the First World War. But then a top Whitehall official decided that flying the Union Flag at half-mast on August 4 could confuse the public into thinking someone important had died. Organisers in Shepton Mallet, Somerset, were upset and disappointed at the insistence by senior policy advisor Fiona Wood that permission had to be given by the Queen or Prime Minister. She said that flying flags at half-mast was not intended ‘to celebrate anniversaries of tragic events’. But . yesterday, after protests, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport . backtracked and admitted it had no control over flag flying. Councillor . Jeannette Marsh, who arranged the event, said: ‘I did feel quite upset. It felt like they had forgotten the people who had given their lives. Many local people felt the same way.’ The . original refusal came after Shepton Mallet town clerk Daryl Ryall asked . permission to lower the flag on their town hall as a traditional mark . of respect. Ms Wood replied . in an Email: 'While flags flying in general is deregulated, individuals, . groups or organisations cannot chose when to fly a flag at half- mast. 'An . instruction for the half-masting of flags can only be given by Her . Majesty the Queen (or by or the Prime Minister's Office with approval . from Buckingham Palace) to mark the death of a member of the Royal . family or an important statesperson, or to mark a tragedy has just . happened rather than to celebrate anniversaries of tragic events. 'As . I am sure you will agree, any independent half-masting of flags may . confuse other people into thinking that an important figure has just . died, for example a member of the Royal Family. 'Flags . are not flown at half-mast for the Remembrance Sunday service for . example and I hope you can devise another fitting way to pay your local . tribute as part of the commemorations of the 1st World War.' Organisers in Shepton Mallet, Somerset, wanted to make a poignant gesture at a vigil to mark 100 years since the start of the First World War . But . as the ban threatened to spark a row the Government backed down and . admitted they had no jurisdiction on flag flying - and there are no . official rules. A Department . for Culture, Media and Sport spokeswoman said: 'Decisions on whether to . fly flags at half-mast are not made by Government. 'Orders on when to fly flags at half-mast are taken by Buckingham Palace and occur in response to the death of a prominent statesperson or member of the Royal Family. 'Any decision to fly flags at half-mast outside of these occasions would be for local authorities themselves.' Cadets march past the Cenotaph in Shepton Mallet during an earlier remembrance event . The centenary event will see the Air . Training Corps cadets stage a vigil, and include a church service and . music to remember those who gave their lives. It has been arranged by Councillor Jeannette Marsh who said the original refusal on flying the flag at half-mast had been 'upsetting and disappointing'. She said: 'I must say I really did feel quite upset. 'It felt like they had forgotten the people who had given their lives. 'I was very upset to think that we could not mark those ten million lives lost by lowering the flag and I know very many local people felt the same way - very disappointed.' Resident Will Dunscombe, 54, who staged a 24-hour vigil at the foot of the cenotaph in 2007 to fight plans to move it, slammed the government's intrusion. He said: 'It should be nothing to do with the Government - why should the Government dictate what we as people want to do? 'They decide enough of what we do and this shouldn't be a political dilemma. 'Let . people feel that feeling how they want to feel it and stop being so . critical. They shouldn't interfere and meddle in how people want to . commemorate - especially young people.' Councillor Chris Inchley said the government's refusal was 'very sad indeed'. He . said: 'People won't be confused - everyone around the country will know . that that day is to commemorate World War One and the tragic . consequence that had for many millions of people and families around the . world and in our community.' Colleague councillor Neil Shearn added: 'It is totally bureaucratic. It is laughable. 'I . don't think the government or royalty has anything to do with it at . all.

"A 69-year-old has been struck down by a crippling infection that lay dormant in his body for 20 years. Ray Squire lost six stone while suffering from discitis – an infection he picked up while swimming off Australia’s Great Barrier Reef in 1992. Tropical medicine experts believe that he probably picked up the bug, which left him unable to walk for weeks, as a result of swallowing sea water. Ray Squire lost six stone while suffering from discitis - an infection he picked up while swimming off Australia's Great Barrier Reef in 1992 . However, it was only two decades later that it struck, suddenly leaving him in agony and unable to walk. Mr Squire, of Pentre Maelor, Wrexham, North Wales, was in hospital for seven weeks while he fought the infection. One year on, he is still on morphine for the pain. He said: ‘The past year has been absolutely horrendous. There were times when I didn't think I was going to make it. ‘When you're in unbelievable pain for 24 hours a day it just wears you down.’ In 1992 Mr Squire and his 67-year-old wife Iris, spent six weeks travelling around Australia. He spent seven weeks in hospital and, a year later, he still requires morphine for the pain in his back . When he returned he was fit and well. However, last April, when the couple were holidaying in Devon he started to feel unwell. The former truck driver said: ‘By the time we'd arrived on the coach I was in terrific pain, and by the time we'd got home I couldn't move from my bed.’ Discistis is an infection in the disc space of the spine, which can lead to the disc eroding and being permanently damaged. Symptoms include severe back pain and a mild fever. It may resolve on its own if untreated, or it may progress to a chronic infection or even cause an abscess to form. The cause of discitis is still unclear - it can be triggered by post-operative complications or from a separate infection, such as a urinary infection or a unknown bug, as in Mr Squire's case. Treatment usually involves antibiotics, and a back brace or plaster cast. When he got home, Mr Squire underwent . a scan at Wrexham Maelor Hospital, the results of which were sent to . the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine for an expert opinion. Doctors . then broke the news that he was suffering from discitis - an infection . in the disc space in his spine - and he was admitted to the Orthopaedic . Hospital in Gobowen, Shropshire, to be treated with intravenous . antibiotics. The main symptom of the condition is severe back pain which can lead to loss of mobility. It is treated with antibiotics. He said: ‘Doctors told me I may have picked up a bug up in the Tropics, but it's still a mystery as to how - most probably I swallowed something. ‘We had an apartment in Cairns and I chose to go swimming in the Barrier Reef, but Iris never did. ‘The doctors said it can lie dormant for years, and I never even knew. ‘My doctor said he has been practicing for 28 years and had never come across the condition before. ‘Eventually I went home but still I couldn't even wash or dress myself.’ It is believed that Mr Squire got the infection from sea water while holidaying with his wife, Iris, in Australia . Mr Squire is now on the mend, but says the healing process will take at least another year. He said: ‘I'm more or less back to normal now, but I still have to take morphine for the pain. ‘I can drive my car now, but walking is still very difficult. ‘I've just got to wait until I get back where I was.’","Ray Squire lost six stone while suffering from discitis in April 2012 .

"Dog owners have healthier hearts than people who don’t have pets, research suggests. And those who already have cardiac problems may be more likely to survive if they have the companionship of a pet. The American Heart Association reviewed studies from around the world and concluded pet ownership, particularly dog ownership, ‘is probably associated with a decreased risk of heart disease’. Research suggests dog owners walk far more than other people, which could help descrease the risk of heart disease . The strongest data comes from studies which show that dog owners walk far more than other people. Research also credits pets with relieving stress and having a beneficial effect on obesity and cholesterol levels. Glenn Levine, who led the study, said there may also be a psychological benefit from simple companionship. The American Heart Association said the research doesn’t actually prove that the benefits come directly from the pets. For instance, it may be that healthier people are particularly likely to be animal lovers. The American Heart Association said the research doesn't actually prove that the benefits come directly from the pets (file picture) However, the links are strong enough for it to have issued a statement saying that pet ownership and, particularly dog ownership, may be associated with a decreased risk of heart disease. Dr Levine, of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, said the benefits may come from a range of physical factors, including exercise and stress relief. Speaking as he walked his three dogs, he said: ‘A person may take better care of themselves if they have a good bond with a pet and feel better about themselves and are more motivated to live longer.’ He added that pet owners still need to take care of their heart in other ways. ‘The primary reason you should adopt or rescue or buy a pet is to give that pet a loving home and to derive enjoyment from the relationship . ‘We don’t want people to go out and adopt a dog or a cat and then sit on the couch eating potato chips and smoking a cigarette and assume they are now going to live longer.’","American Heart Association reviewed studies from around the world .

"Pele has revealed that he is 'doing fine' following reports that the Brazilian icon had been admitted to a special care unit in a Sao Paulo hospital. The three-time World Cup winner took to Twitter to let fans know that he was 'not put into intenstive care' and is on the road to recovery from a urinary tract infection. The 74-year-old wrote: 'Hello everyone, I want to take this opportunity to let you know that I am doing fine. Brazil legend Pele has been admitted to hospital twice this month, but claims he is 'doing fine' 'I was not put into intensive care today, I was simply relocated to a special room within the hospital for privacy purposes only. 'While I appreciate all the visitors that came to see me, I really need to continue my treatment and recovery in peace. 'I am blessed to receive your love and support, and thank God this is nothing serious. 'I am looking forward to spending the upcoming holidays with my family, and will start the new year with renewed health, with many international trips already planned! Thank you!' Pele is now expected to make a 'quick and full' recovery from the minor infection caused by a recent surgery to remove kidney stones, his manager said Thursday. Paul Kemsley said in a statement sent to The Associated Press that reports about the deterioration of Pele's condition and about him going into intensive care 'were greatly exaggerated.' 'He was relocated to a special area of the hospital for privacy purposes only, due to having an overwhelming number of visitors which prevented him from getting the necessary care and treatment,' he said. 'He is expected to make a quick and full recovery.' The Albert Einstein hospital released a statement earlier in the day saying the 74-year-old Pele was transferred to a 'special care' unit after his condition became unstable.

He should be out of the hospital in a few days.' The hospital later released another statement saying that Pele's condition 'improved,' but for the first time mentioned that he was in 'an intensive care unit' and temporarily undergoing kidney support treatment. The hospital's press office had previously denied that Pele was in intensive care. Kemsley's statement about Pele's condition came after the hospital's latest report.

'Pele plans to spend the upcoming holidays with his family, and in the new year, he will recommence his busy worldwide schedule,' Kemsley said. 'Trips to Australia, China, Nigeria and Azerbaijan are already confirmed for the early part of 2015.' Pele, a three-time World Cup winner, successfully underwent surgery to remove kidney stones on Nov. 13. He was admitted to the hospital on Monday for a medical evaluation and was diagnosed with the infection. He was being treated with antibiotics. He has enjoyed good health in recent years despite needing to undergo surgeries for a hip replacement and a detached retina. Pele, widely known as the greatest footballer of all time, is a national hero in Brazil. He remains a worldwide ambassador to football and is active with his many businesses across the globe. He still participates in many advertising campaigns and is present at most major football tournaments. He won the World Cup with Brazil in 1958, '62 and 1970 and is known as the game's most prolific scorer, credited with 1,281 goals in 1,363 career matches.

"When a hungry mother-of-two bit into a tasty chicken, bacon and lettuce sandwich from Tesco, she got a mouthful she wasn't expecting. Katie Crabtree was shocked to discover a hairy creature that appeared to be a rodent inside the pre-packaged snack she had bought from a branch of the supermarket chain in Stockport. The horrified 31-year-old only spotted the ‘furry object’ after swallowing part of it - thinking it was a piece of burnt bacon.

'It was black and had hair - and I could see a little paw. It was horrendous.' Ms Crabtree said the shocking discovery made her feel sick. 'I can’t eat another packaged sandwich because I just think of that horrible thing,' she said. She accused the supermarket giant of . trying to ignore her after she followed up her initial complaint with . the store and head office. 'I chased it up a few . times with the store and head office but nobody seemed to know what was . happening,' she said. 'In the end they gave me a £10 voucher. 'I think they’ve fobbed me off.

Snack: A Peruvian women takes a bite from a roasted Guinea Pig . Guinea pigs are popular snacks in Peru. The rodents are killed, stripped of their fur, and roasted on a spit - in scenes that would be sure to horrify many Western pet owners. Once the animals have been cooked to a crisp, street vendors arrange them into various poses - decorating them with strips of vegetables to make it look like they have tongues and eyeballs. Guinea pig has been an important dish in the Andes highlands for thousands of years, and is a dish eaten in many South American countries. In Cusco, Peru, a common guinea pig dish is called chiriuchu. The name means 'cold food' in quechua, the language of the Incas, and it centres on guinea pig (known locally as 'cuy'), and also includes a portion of chicken, dried salt-beef, blood sausage, sea-weed, toasted maize, cheese, fish eggs, hot pepper and a potato and herb tortilla. Chiriuchu is typically eaten at local festivals, especially during Corpus Christi, where it is available from street-side stands. The dish is so popular, locals have even appealed to UNESCO for it to be declared part of the Cusqueñan cultural heritage.","Horrified 31-year-old swallowed part of the hairy creature thinking it was burnt bacon .

"WWII hero Leslie Claydon, 95, proudly wears his Arctic Star medal which he had been denied because the MoD thought he was dead . An Arctic convoy hero has finally got his medal - after bungling Ministry of Defence staff declared he was dead. Leslie Claydon, 95, has just been presented with the Arctic Star almost a year after many other Second World War veterans. The ex-Royal Navy serviceman was only eventually awarded the honour because his angry daughter fought to win him it tooth and nail as she told hapless civil servants that he was alive. Dr Gillian Harris, of Hockley, Essex, . stepped in to battle for her dad, who now lives in a nursing home, . after her brother, Ian Claydon, suddenly died. Dr . Harris said she filled in the Arctic Star application form for her . elderly father 'clearly leaving the date of death area blank'. She furiously fired off a blizzard of emails to MoD staff when she heard nothing back - but still got no response. Dr Harris said: 'I emailed them time and again. Finally I wrote to them as well. 'Eventually . they told me they’d dealt with all the people who were due a medal who . were alive and were now looking at the relatives of dead service personnel.' She . redoubled her efforts - insisting that her father was alive and that . time was of the essence because he was now well turned 90. 'They . all thought he was dead but he obviously wasn’t - so I told them that . they needed to prioritise him first,' added Dr Harris. 'I . used my contact details because my father is partially-sighted so I can . only think they wrongly presumed that I was applying for my late . father.' Mr Claydon proudly showed mayor of Havering Cllr Eric Munday wartime pictures of his warship, which survived the conflict . She said she was mightily relieved that they had got there in the end and her father had finally been awarded the medal he so richly 'deserved'. Mr Claydon was presented with the Arctic Star by Havering mayor, Cllr Eric Munday, in a moving ceremony at Abbcross Nursing Home in Romford on Tuesday. The poignant presentation was attended by members of the local Royal British Legion. Leslie, who served on the Royal Navy minesweeper HMS Speedwell, told the mayor: 'Thank you very much, I’m very proud.' He proudly showed Cllr Munday and Legion officials wartime pictures of his warship, which survived the conflict. An unidentified sailor aboard an arctic convoy ship. The sailors faced repeated attacks by German U-boats, surface warships and long-range Luftwaffe bombers in mountainous seas, freezing temperatures and gale-force winds . Mr Claydon played a vital role, helping to escort merchant ships loaded with tanks, warplanes, guns, Jeeps and other crucial supplies to Joseph Stalin’s Soviet Union after the giant communist state was attacked by Hitler’s Nazi Germany. The heroic sailor would have faced repeated attacks by German U-boats, surface warships and long-range Luftwaffe bombers in mountainous seas and gale-force winds. And Leslie and his comrades would have battled bone-chilling temperatures plunging to a deadly -50C as thick ice coated British and Allied ships heading north to the Soviet ports of Murmansk and Archangel deep inside the Arctic Circle.","Leslie Claydon served aboard Royal Navy minesweeper HMS Speedwell .

In October last year the Hackney-based artist created a project in Margate called From The Knees Of My Nose To The Belly Of My Toes, which featured the facade of a derelict house appearing to slide off and into the front garden. The property had recently been purchased by Thanet Council after sitting empty for more than 11 years, and Mr Chinneck persuaded ten companies to donate £100,000 in materials and resources to make the project a reality. Melting away: In October last year Mr Chinneck also created this installation in Margate, called From The Knees Of My Nose To The Belly Of My Toes . Abandoned: The house had recently been purchased by Thanet Council after being abandoned for 11 years before Mr Chinneck set up his £100,000 project . The year-long installation, which exposed the top floor of the building to the elements, while relocating the front door into the front garden, was inspired by the opening of the new Turner Contemporary gallery. Afterwards the building was returned to the council. Three months later Mr Chinneck was at it again, this time unveiling an installation called Miner On The Moon on a building in Blackfriars Road, London, which was due to be demolished. The project made it appear as if the building, a former livery stables hiring out horse and carriages, had flipped upside down. At the time,Mr Chinneck said: 'I'm keen on this idea that when people go to an art gallery they go there through choice and they enter into that experience. Flip side: This former livery stables on Blackfriars Road in London appeared to have been flipped on its head in another of Mr Chinneck's artworks . Disused: Like his previous project in Margate, Mr Chinneck picked the building as it was about to be demolished and said it's shape inspired the upside down design . 'But with public sculpture, people don't necessarily make that choice - they may not like the artwork or may not want the artwork and therefore I think it's important for the work to be able to disappear and not dominate its environment, but be harmonious with the environment. 'For that reason I used only the materials which feature across Southwark and Blackfriars so although the artwork is quite bold it also has subtlety and the ability to camouflage into its environment.'","Trick makes it seem a section of market building has broken free from foundations in London's Covent Garden .

"Never-before-seen interviews with First World War soldiers revealing the true horror of going 'over the top' in battle are to be shown on television for the first time. In the heart-wrenching footage the former soldiers tell the true story of life in the trenches, and the emotions that went through the minds of the young men who gave their all in the deadly conflict. In one poignant clip, to be shown on the BBC as part of a series of programmes commemorating the Great War, one unnamed German veteran asks: 'What was it, that we soldiers stabbed each other, strangled each other, went for each other, like mad dogs?' Scroll down for video . Poignant: In one never-before-seen interview to be screened on the BBC this former British soldier reveals the 'terror' of the First World War . Questioning: In another clip, to be shown on BBC2's My Great War a German veteran asks what made soldiers fight 'like mad dogs'? Another British soldier remarks: 'As soon as you get over the top, fear has left you and it's terror.' The . powerful interviews were filmed back in 1964, but were left on the . cutting-room floor when producers of the classic 1960s series The Great . War decided to focus on the history of the conflict. Instead, the hours of unseen interviews . with war veterans, stored on the original film reels, have been kept in the vaults of . the Imperial War Museum for 50 years. They . are now set to be broadcast for the first time in BBC2's My Great . War - which aims to show the personal experiences of those involved in . battle, taking in everyday life in the trenches, dog fights in the air, . fraternising with the enemy and even the actual experience of killing. Over the top: Soldiers climbing over their trench on July 1, 1916 - the first day of the Battle of the Somme . Website: The BBC will create a 'digital cenotaph' online to commemorate the First World War . A selection of the original recordings, in their entirety, will also be made permanently available to view on the BBC iPlayer. My Great War is one of 130 programmes to be shown between next years and 2018 as part of a huge project to mark the centenary of the First World War. As part of the four-year series the BBC aims to create a ‘digital cenotaph’ to honour the sacrifices made between 1914 and 1918. By . collecting nearly 1,500 family stories, photos and trench diaries on . its website, the corporation said it wanted to create a ‘living memorial’ to the fallen as part of a four-year project to mark the anniversary. Between . next year and 2018, the BBC will show more than 2,500 hours of TV and . radio programmes dedicated to the war - including more than 130 new . dramas, history documentaries and music shows. Off to the front: Guards leaving for the start of the war to end all wars . Lord . Hall – whose grandfather fought in the trenches as a private in the . Liverpool Scottish regiment – said the commemorations would ‘inspire a . new generation to understand what happened’. He . added: ‘I see 2014 as a chance for us all to learn something new about a . war we think we maybe know very well, or to engage people who have not . thought about World War I.’ The . online archive – to be collated on the BBC website – will allow readers . to find Great War stories from every part of the UK. The BBC’s head of history . commissioning Martin Davidson said: ‘All you’ll need to do will be to . enter your location to unlock local first world war stories in the form . of two minute audio clips. It is our ambition to turn it into a living . memorial. Britain's Great War: The BBC's First World War series will begin with the four-part series on BBC1 hosted by Jeremy Paxman . ‘It has been . designed to allow a new generation to understand the sacrifices made on . its behalf by one that went long before. We hope that together with our . audiences and our users we will create nothing less than a digital . cenotaph.’ The First World War season – billed as the biggest in the corporation’s history –  will begin with a four-part BBC1 series Britain’s Great War hosted by Jeremy Paxman. Last week, the Newsnight host criticised Prime Minister David Cameron for comparing next year’s commemorations to the Diamond Jubilee, describing him as ‘cloth-eared’. On BBC2, rival historical heavyweights Sir Max Hastings and Niall Ferguson will be pitted against each other in rival documentaries. Each will present a competing account of how the war started, with Sir Max defending Britain’s decision to fight and Professor Ferguson arguing we were wrong to get involved. Another BBC2 documentary Gallipoli will feature an interview with media mogul Rupert Murdoch, discussing his father’s role in exposing the disastrous campaign. Lord Hall also unveiled a series of new First World War dramas yesterday. On BBC1, The Ark will star Charlie Chaplin’s great-granddaughter Oona as a nurse in a front-line field hospital. And Radio 4 will host a four-year drama series Home Front, exploring the fortunes of those who remained in Britain over 600 episodes. Lord Hall said: ‘Every one of us lives in a world which is profoundly shaped by those events, or have family that was touched by the Great War. It changed the face of our communities, our country and our world forever, and we’ll be telling that story over the next four years, right across the BBC.

"The world’s largest solar power plant has gone online in California, with enough power to supply 160,000 homes. Spanning a huge 9.5 square miles (25 square km) - a third of the size of Manhattan - the Topaz Solar Farm consists of nine million solar panels and has a capacity of 550 megawatts. And it is a major step towards the state's goals of supplying 33 per cent of electricity to homes from renewable sources by 2020. Scroll down for video . The Topaz Solar Farm (shown) has gone online in California's Carrizo Plain. The $2.5bn project spans 9.5 square miles and has nine million panels. It has a capacity of 550 megawatts, enough to power 160,000 homes. And it will take the place of 370,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions . The mammoth $2.5 billion (£1.5 billion) project is located in California’s Carrizo Plain, in southeastern San Luis Obispo County. Construction began back in 2011 but now, with the installation of the final 40 megawatt segment, it is now the first 500-plus megawatt solar farm to come online in the US. And, at a total of 550 megawatts, it is also the largest solar plant online in the world. Households in the UK could see their energy bills slashed by £425million by the end of the next decade if the government adopts a ‘stable’ policy on solar power. The Centre for Economics and Business Research said that, with the government’s support, electricity produced by solar panels could become cheaper than the wholesale electricity price by 2024. This could result in 18 million homes benefiting from low-cost electricity by 2030. The CEBR, which carried out the study for the Solar Trade Association, also said the solar power industry could contribute £25.5billion to the economy and generate 50,000 jobs. With prices in the industry having tumbled since 2010, the report suggests that building solar panel stations could become cheaper than constructing new gas plants by 2018. The power it produces takes the place of 377,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions annually - equivalent to taking 73,000 cars off the road. Construction was actually due to finish in early 2015, so it has been finished ahead of schedule. Unlike some solar plants, the Topaz requires no water to generate electricity, and it makes very minimal noise as there are no moving parts. Each of the solar panels stands just five and a half feet (1.7 metres) off the ground, reducing visible impact from the expansive farm. ‘First Solar projects have a low environmental impact,’ the company said. ‘When in operation, our systems generate electricity with no air emissions, no waste production, no water use, and have the smallest carbon footprint of any photovoltaic technology.’ The Topaz Solar Farm is part of an initiative to make a third of California’s electricity come from renewable sources by 2020. The plant will ultimately be usurped by another solar farm in the US next year; SunPower’s Solar Star, also in California, will be capable of producing 579 megawatts.

"Photographer Jason Cole has been behind the camera at almost 1,400 weddings, but there is one he will never forget - the one where he met his future wife. The only snag was she was the bride. The 44-year-old, from Woollongong, south of Sydney, first met Julie Bridges, 28, in 2009 when he sat down with her and her husband-to-be for a consultation before their nuptials the following year. During the build up to the ceremony, Mr Cole said he got on well with both parties, insisting there were no sparks when they first met. Jason and Julie Cole first met in 2009 when Julie was getting married to her first husband . With their dog, Chubby Cole, in tow the Woollongong couple tied the knot five years after they first met . 'I actually thought Jason was gay at first because when we went into the consultation, there was a lot of pink and a lot of fluffy dogs and then he introduced his partner, Craig,' Mrs Cole told MailOnline. Craig was Mr Cole's then-business partner. Mr Cole said he treated Julie the same way he treated all his clients. 'When we first met we got along – I get along with all my customers – I’m a people person,' he said. 'I helped Julie a lot with the planning. Then after the wedding, we used to talk a lot and we had a real connection.' Mrs Cole - then Julie Bridges - came in for a wedding photo consulation . The couple tied the knot on June 7 at Wentworth Falls in New South Wales . They stayed in touch after Julie tied the knot with Paul - a chef whose full name they were reluctant to disclose. 'That's old news,' Mr Cole said, diplomatically. 'Towards the end of that relationship, we got a lot closer.' 'But I was married about 10 years ago and I know when [a marriage breaks up] sometimes you need a bit of space.' The couple are adamant nothing happened between them until April 2012, after Julie's marriage to Paul had ended. Mr and Mrs Cole shared their first kiss the day after Anzac Day and married on June 7 this year at Wentworth Falls in the Blue Mountains. 'I messaged him and said I wanted to come over and watch movies,' Mrs Cole said of their hook-up two years ago. 'He said he was sick and I said: ""That’s OK, I’ll take a hint"" because I didn't think he liked me. 'But then he said ""Come over"", and he really was sick. 'Then we had our first kiss, I was really shy about it.' The Coles chose to have their wedding - with their pet dog, Chubby Cole, in tow - in the Blue Mountains (right) because of the spectacular scenery . Mr and Mrs Cole said they were now inseparable - working at the photography studio and living together . Fresh from their honeymoon, the couple said they couldn't believe how much media attention their story had attracted. 'It’s just crazy the way things happen – it’s just like Sliding Doors [the movie],' Julie said. 'If I had never got married, I would have never met Jason. 'Everybody laughs at our story and think it’s sweet. 'But we don’t even think about it anymore – it’s just normal for us.'","Woollongong couple Jason and Julie Cole got married on June 7 .

"A reckless Ferrari driver has narrowly avoided sparking traffic chaos in Sydney's CBD after performing a dangerous burnout in the middle of a four-way intersection. The driver's blatant disregard for motorist and pedestrian safety was filmed along what appears to be Elizabeth Street in the Sydney CBD, but even more shocking is the fact it was being used as a vehicle in a Sydney wedding procession.

"The violinist who stormed the stage and hurled eggs at Simon Cowell during the final of Britain's Got Talent has claimed she was 'taking a stand against his dreadful influence' on the industry. Natalie Holt - a BAFTA-nominated composer who appeared in the closing ceremony of last summer's Olympics - jumped to . the front of the stage as brothers Richard and Adam were performing and . pelted the judge before she was dragged off by security. She has since said the stunt was a stand against miming on TV and Simon Cowell's 'dreadful influence on the music industry.' It comes as pictures have emerged of the talented musician in a range of eccentric poses. Scroll down for video . Smiling as she peers around a door, this is one of the eccentric pictures which have emerged of Natalie Holt, the backing musician who pelted Simon Cowell with eggs . Ms Holt (second from left)  can be seen here with other members of the Raven Quartet, who pose elegantly for the camera, while she waves her bow above her head and appears to be mid laugh . In another picture of the group, Ms Holt appears to have her friend in a musical headlock as she embraces him from behind and carries on playing her instrument . Ms Holt, smiling again, is pictured here brandishing a sword . She told the Telegraph: 'I basically took a stand . against people miming on television and against Simon and his dreadful . influence on the music industry.' Ms Holt is an accomplished and well regarded musician, not only on the viola and violin, but also piano, mouth organ, guitar, Chinese harp and vocals, and has worked with a host of A list musical talent, including Take That, The Last Shadow Puppets, Gwen Stefani and Andrea Bocelli. More than 13 million people watched the Britain's Got Talent live final last night, with an average of 11.1 million viewers across the two-and-a-half show, ITV said. It comes as former X Factor contestant Kitty Brucknell has revealed the viola player was once her flatmate. But she has been quick to distance herself from the musician's actions - labeling her stunt 'pretty cruel and stupid'. It has also been revealed she auditioned . for the talent show in 2012, along with her band Raven Quartet - who . have also distanced themselves from her actions. She apologised after the show via an official statement, but it has done little to quell the barrage of criticism . leveled at her on Twitter and Facebook. The 30-year-old was accused of 'grinning like a lunatic' by one user, while others labeled the stunt 'pathetic'. Former X Factor contestant Kitty Brucknell has been quick to distance herself from musician Natalie Holt's bizarre actions - as it is revealed the pair once lived together . Apology: Her boyfriend Chris Waitt said Miss Holt had been 'pressured' to say sorry publically after the incident . Protest: Miss Holt was grinning and laughing as she threw the eggs at the judges . Disgruntled: Natalie Holt, pictured with Matt LeBlanc has been named as the woman who egged Simon Cowell on stage on Saturday night's Britain's Got Talent final . Quick change of heart: Shortly after the end of the show Natalie apologised for her actions . And Ms Brucknell, who appeared on X- factor in 2010, seemed equally unimpressed according to her tweets during the show. Unreality TV reports the pair were once housemates. Kitty – who made it to the live . finals of the 2010 series of the ITV singing show – tweeted during the show as it dawned on her who the phantom egg thrower was. She wrote: 'I just . have to say something. Is that egg girl – is her name Natalie? I have . some pretty earth shattering news if it is!' She then added: 'Actually having a . huge sychronicity moment right now' and '...west London. Names? Natalie . & Chris. Natalie was... in a string quartet... That tried out for . BGT and didn’t get past boot camp.' 'Just found her email. F***. Her name was Natalie Holt. How is this even real??? WTF??????' She added: 'Just to make it clear…I’m . absolutely disgusted that someone would do that – might have been funny . for some, but those singers were amazing' 'And didn’t deserve their performance to be ruined like that. It was so unnecessary….and actually pretty cruel and stupid.' 'I was there when she tried out for BGT…she seemed so normal?!?!' Former X Factor contestant Kitty Brucknell has revealed the viola player who pelted Simon Cowell with eggs during the live final of Britain's Got Talent last night was once her flatmate . Not everyone has taken Ms Holt's actions so seriously however. Simon Cowell seems to have taken the . on stage attack in good spirits, simply tweeting: ' I really don't like . eggs', while a Facebook group has been set up in support of the . musician. Stop The Hatred for the Lovely Natalie Holt so far has 11 'likes'. John Prescott has also offered the music mogul his support in a tongue-in-cheek tweet. He wrote : '@Simon Cowell I’m here if you need me' Mr Prescott was pelted with an egg by a protester in Rhyl in 2001. Ms Holt worked on the . BAFTA nominated score for BBC's Great Expectations with Martin Phipps, and a range of major films including Hannibal .

Boyle, Elaine Page, Andrea Bocelli, Il Divo, Hayley Westenra, Echo and . the Bunnymen, Katherine Jenkins, Take That, and with song writer Guy . Chambers. In a statement released by the show Ms Holt said: 'I want to apologise to Richard and Adam for overshadowing . their performance. I’ve never done anything like this before and in . hindsight I have realised it was a silly thing to do.' Her band mates have insisted that . they were not involved. A tweet from the group feed read: . 'Just to clarify…. The other 3 of us were working elsewhere today and . found out when you did.' A spokesman for the show told . MailOnline: 'During tonight’s show an incident took place during the . finale of Richard and Adam’s performance. 'Natalie Holt (age 30) was part . of the backing group for their performance and as a result of her . misguided actions the police were called. However, we have decided to . take no further action at this stage.' Judge Amanda Holden spoke of her anger at the disruption Natalie's appearance on stage caused and she  branded her 'a stupid cow' for the apparent act of protest. Taking the plunge: The musician appeared on the talent show with her band, who deny they were involved in the egging . Simon had to remove his jacket and was left with yolk on his shirt following the attack, but he didn't seem too fazed. For more video, please go to Britain's Got Talent . Although the egging occurred in the middle of their performance, Richard and Adam were not put off and . they were later praised for their professional attitude. Simon said he thought the woman was throwing sandwiches and assumed it was part of the performance. He said: 'I thought it was part of the act, I thought they were throwing sandwiches.' Disabled comedian Jack Carroll was the next act to perform on stage and he used the opportunity to make a joke about the situation. He began: 'Can I just say, I was going to run on and throw some eggs, so thanks for ruining that.' Angry: Amanda Holden was less than impressed with the stunt during the final of Britain's Got Talent . Stage invasion: A woman ran up in front of the judges to pelt them with eggs . Smile on her face: The girl beamed as she threw the eggs during Richard and Adam's performance . Target: Miss Holt picked out Simon Cowell as she wanted to make a point about his dominance of the music industry . It's no yolk: Simon had to remove his jacket after it was hit but he still had some egg on his shirt . Natalie appeared on Britain's Got Talent last year with her band Raven Quartet. But it seems she and her band mates didn't have a positive . experience on the talent show last year. Natalie's band mate Rachael Lander . wrote a scathing blog post about the group's experience on the show, . which has since been taken down. In the piece she wrote: 'Honestly, if . you think watching those talent shows is gut wrenching, you should try . being a contestant in one.' Rachael claimed the group were approached by the show and deliberated over whether to audition. She wrote: 'We had to acknowledge the . grim truth, which was that Raven needed a bigger profile to get any . kind of deal, we could get a load more gigs if we played to 15 million . viewers, even if those viewers were of the opinion that a dog with a . hula hoop constituted entertainment gold.' Another extract for the post reads: . 'We were uncomfortable that we were, by entering, complicit with the . exploitation of the vulnerable to be humiliated in front of millions. But we had made ourselves publicity whores, we’d made our bed, we had to . play.' Piers Morgan tweeted: 'My vote goes to the egg-thrower. #BGT.' However the broadcaster read Natalie's last tweet, dated from December, which read: 'Thinking about starting a petition to stop Piers Morgan being sent back over.....,' and soon changed his mind. He wrote: 'If the egg-thrower was @filmmusicholt as Twitter claims, then after seeing her last tweet, I'm withdrawing my vote! #BGT.'

"1995 and 1998 videos show GOP candidate discussing contents of newsletters . Paul claims he didn't write or read the letters . Ron Paul has denied knowing what was published in racist and homophobic newsletters sent in his name until at least a decade later, but newly resurfaced videos are proving his claims false. In the latest video to surface, the Texas congressman and contender for the Republican nomination for president appears to take credit for the controversial newsletters. In the 1995 footage, uncovered by Buzz feed, the candidate said:  'I...do a newsletter, it's called the Ron Paul Survival Report,' he said. 'It's expressing concerning about surviving in this age of big government.' Scroll down for video . Contradictions:  Paul is shown in 1995, left, and in 1988, right, discussing the contents of the controversial newsletters, despite claiming he had not read them . Material in the newsletters- named the Ron Paul Political Report, Ron . Paul’s Freedom Report, the Ron Paul Survival Report and the Ron Paul . Investment Letter- contained racist, homophobic and anti-Semitic rants. 'I didn't read that stuff, I was aware of it probably 10 years after it was written.' Paul told CNN in an interview this week. 'I didn’t write them. I disavow them. That's it,' he added. The . controversial newsletters, which reportedly made Paul $1m, featured a . series of racist statements, including, 'We are constantly told that it . is evil to be afraid of black men, it is hardly irrational.' Referring to the 1992 Los Angeles riots, another read, 'Order was only restored in . L.A. when it came time for the blacks to pick up their welfare checks.' The . articles called Martin Luther King Jr. a 'world-class . philanderer,' criticized the U.S. holiday bearing King's name as 'Hate . Whitey Day', and said that AIDS sufferers 'enjoy the attention and pity that comes with being sick.' Under fire: Texas congressman Ron Paul, now a contender for the Republican nomination for president, is coming under increasing criticism . Paul is currently surging in the polls. Despite claiming he did not read the . material until years later, Paul - also appears to be knowledgeable about the contents of the newsletters in . two much earlier C-Span videos. A letter signed by Paul in 1993 warning of a 'coming race war' has also been uncovered. The . scare-mongering letter written in 1993 lists far-fetched conspiracy . theories and urges the reader to 'save their family' by forking out for . the $99 subscription. A video from 1995 shows the GOP presidential hopeful discussing the controversial newsletters. In . the resurfaced interview, Paul - then out of office and trying to . return to Congress - describes the 'educational' newsletters and appears . to be aware of their contents. 'It . covered a lot about what was going on in Washington: financial events, . especially some of the monetary events, since I had been especially . interested in monetary policy, had been on the banking committee and am still very interested in that subject,' he said. Mailer: The scare-mongering letter written in 1993 lists far-fetched conspiracy theories and urges the reader to 'save their family' by forking out for the $99 . 'This newsletter dealt with it. This . has to do with the value of the dollar, the pros and cons of the gold . standard, and of course the disadvantages of all the high taxes and . spending our government seems to continue to do.' The . video was posted on YouTube by Alexander Kaczynski, a self-described . 'political junkie' who has previously unearthed old videos of current . presidential hopefuls, reports the New York Daily News. The . candidate's spokesman, Jesse Benton, told USA Today that Paul was . talking about an investment newsletter and that the incendiary comments . were in others that he did not write. In . 1996, Paul told the Dallas Morning News that the material was accurate . but had just been taken out of context, reports the Daily News. Conspiracy theories: The 1993 letter warns that the U.S. government's redesign of currency was part of a plot to allow the government to track Americans . Scare-mongering: The letter makes far-fetched claims and urges readers to sign up to the $99 subscription to 'save their families' Controversy: The letter warning of a 'coming race war' and soliciting the 'racist' newsletters carries Ron Paul's signature, pictured . Another clip dated 1988, which was . uncovered by the Huffington Post, shows Paul talking about spending time . on his newsletter when he was away from public office. 'I . also put out an investment type of letter because I've always been . fascinated with the hard money school, and been interested in the gold . standard, so I put out an investment letter on those lines,' he said amidst his run for presidency at the time. It is worth noting, however, that most of the 'racist' text came four years after this C-SPAN interview in the early 90s.. The . 1993 eight-page letter, however, came a year after the most . inflammatory newsletter was published during the 1992 LA riots, and . appears to carry Paul's signature at the end. Oops: A 1995 video shows the GOP presidential hopeful discussing the contents of the newsletters contradicting his claims he wasn't aware of them at that time . The . letter urges readers to subscribe to Paul's newsletters so that he . could 'tell you how you can save yourself and your family' from an . overbearing government. It also warns that the U.S. government's redesign of currency to include different colors - a move aimed at thwarting counterfeiters - actually was part of a plot to allow the government to track Americans. His Iowa chairman, Drew Ivers, has repeated Paul's claims that he did not write the articles, reports Reuters. Paul has repeatedly said the articles do not reflect his views, highlighting that his public stances - such as supporting homosexuals in the military -  run counter to the incendiary statements in them.. His campaign claims he also did not write the mailer, although it carries his signature. Touchy: Earlier reports made it seem like Ron Paul stormed out of the interview, while the raw footage makes it seem like it was simply over . The letter - written during a period in which Paul returned to Washington after a decade's absence -  claims that Paul - through what isdescribed as a network of 'extraordinary sources' - had acquired information that would help his subscribers to 'neutralize' the plans of 'powerbrokers.' The letter goes on to describe a number of conspiracy theories that he had 'unmasked', including a 'plot for world government, world money and world central banking.' It also claims that Paul's newsletters 'laid bare' the 'Israeli lobby, which plays Congress like a cheap harmonica,' and a 'federal-homosexual cover-up on AIDS.' The letter urges readers to buy the $99 subscription to receive Paul's monthly political and investment newsletters, a copy of his book 'Surviving the New Money', an investment manual and access to his Financial hotline.

"The number of people employed by the BBC has risen despite repeated promises to cut staffing levels. Official figures have revealed that 22,039 people work at the corporation, an increase of 310 since last year. It has also emerged that headhunters were paid more than £650,000 in 2013 to fill posts across the organisation. Tony Hall ON his first day as Director General of the BBC at New Broadcasting House in central London . Yesterday critics branded the staffing rise ‘astonishing’ and the use of headhunters ‘ludicrous’. While the official employment figures – taken as a snapshot a month ago – include employees on permanent, fixed-term and flexible contracts, they do not include casual staff, so the true figure could be even higher. In October 2011, then director-general Mark Thompson said 2,000 jobs would be cut by 2017 as part of a push to save £700million. However, the latest figures show the BBC is hiring people faster than it is cutting back. A spokesman for the corporation claimed yesterday it is still on track to make savings of £850million by 2017 and that the rise in staff can be partly attributed to one-off projects. He said: ‘Occasionally staff numbers will fluctuate depending on programme schedules and other special projects, such as the Commonwealth Games, covering the Scottish referendum, further development and personalisation of iPlayer.’ BBC Director-General George Entwistle resigned over his failure to get to grips with the Savile (left) scandal and his predecessor in the BBC hot seat Mark Thompson (right) who promised to cut staff . But the 2014 figure of 22,039 is higher than the 22,013 employed in 2012 when the BBC had the London Olympics and the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee to cover. There was a fall to 21,729 in 2013 before the recent rise. John O’Connell of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘At a time when all public sector organisations should be cutting back on staffing numbers, it’s astonishing the BBC’s has actually increased. ‘You’d have thought the headcount would peak during a big event like the Olympics so the continued growth is disappointing news for families feeling the pinch, hoping for cuts to the licence fee.’ The BBC has also been criticised over the amount it has spent on headhunters. Figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act show that in the calendar year 2013 the BBC spent £657,522 on ‘recruitment consultants, executive search, and headhunting firms for the hiring of BBC staff at all grades, including senior staff and members of the executive board’. In the financial year ending March 2013 it spent £700,813. It was during this period that £150,000 was paid to recruitment consultants to find a replacement for Mr Thompson. But then the BBC made an internal promotion, giving George Entwistle the £450,000-a-year job. He lasted just two months before quitting after a series of scandals including the Sir Jimmy Savile revelations and Newsnight’s wrongful implication of Lord McAlpine in a child abuse case. Tory MP Philip Davies, a member of the Commons culture committee, said it was ‘completely ludicrous’ for BBC to spend so much on headhunters. He added: ‘Most businesses seem to do perfectly well drawing up their own shortlists and don’t have to resort to hiring expensive headhunters. ‘It’s another example of the BBC having too much money, which is why we should have a reduced licence fee.’ A spokesman for the BBC said its main recruitment channel is its website. He added: ‘We do however sometimes use external recruitment consultants to help ensure we obtain applications from a wide range of high-quality candidates, often for very specialised roles.’","Official figures have revealed that 22,039 people work at the corporation .

"As he watched TV reports on a 33-year-old missing-child case, a man who'd never been a suspect started pondering whether he was the killer, he later told a psychologist. ''Did I (do) it?'' . It was just a thought that came into my head,' Pedro Hernandez recalls in the psychologist's report, part of a recent court filing that adds new details about his defense in a case that galvanized the missing-children's movement. 'I was, like, nervous and questioning myself ... trying to make sense.' Hernandez would soon tell police he did choke six-year-old Etan Patz in 1979, confessing after investigators were tipped that he'd spoken of having harmed a child. 'Did I do it?': Pedro Hernandez, who admitted to killing Etan Patz in 1979 in a taped confession, told a psychologist that he questioned himself over the murder after seeing a missing persons report on TV . But defense psychological experts later found him unsure of whether the brutal scenario he'd described was real or imaginary. 'I believed it in my mind that I did it, but I don't think I did it,' Hernandez, 53, told one psychologist. The interplay between belief and reality is shaping up to be a central issue in his murder trial, set for early next year. Since a judge ruled this week that jurors could hear Hernandez's confession, it will be up to them to decide whether it was true. His defense says it was fiction from a man with an IQ in the bottom 2 percent of the population and mental illness that makes it difficult for him to distinguish real life from fantasy. Prosecutors say his confession was legitimate, and they're seeking to limit proposed expert testimony on the psychological phenomenon of false confessions. 1979 crime: Pedro Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to murder in the strangling death of Etan Patz, who was one of the first missing persons to be placed on a milk carton . 'We believe the evidence that Mr. Hernandez killed Etan Patz to be credible and persuasive and that his statements are not the product of any mental illness,' the Manhattan district attorney's office has said. Etan vanished while walking to his school bus stop May 25, 1979, now memorialized as National Missing Children's Day. Hernandez then worked at a nearby corner store. Etan was never found, and the investigation spanned decades. After police followed an ultimately fruitless lead to a Manhattan basement in April 2012 - the news Hernandez watched on TV - they got a tip about him. Authorities eventually learned that in the 1980s, the Maple Shade, New Jersey, man apparently told a friend, his now-ex-wife and a church prayer circle he'd hurt an unnamed child in New York City. One listener remembers him saying he'd dismembered a boy, another recalls him describing strangling a child after being hit with a ball, and even the child's race varied, according to one of three recently filed defense psychologist's reports. But after more than six hours of police questioning, Hernandez gave a calm, consistent account to police and prosecutors on video in May 2012: He choked Etan, put the still-living boy into a plastic bag, stuffed the bag in a box and dumped it on a street. 'I felt like something just took over me,' he said. Unanswered questions: Etan's parents Stan (left) and Julie Patz (right) have been attending Hernandez's trial . But after more than six hours of police questioning, Hernandez gave a calm, consistent account to police and prosecutors on video in May 2012: He choked Etan, put the still-living boy into a plastic bag, stuffed the bag in a box and dumped it on a street. Six-year-old Etan Patz disappeared while walking to his school bus stop in Manhattan in 1979 . 'I felt like something just took over me,' he said. Hernandez has taken anti-psychotic medication for about a decade, and he's been diagnosed most recently with schizotypal personality disorder. Characteristics include social isolation and odd beliefs. He told police he's seen visions of his late mother. He told defense doctors he has heard voices commanding him intermittently since his teens, seen furniture move on its own and observed people others don't see hanging out around his house. He told defense doctors that a voice told him to approach Etan and that several mysterious people followed along during the attack, though he also said the memory 'feels like a dream,' according to the psychologists' reports. 'His delusional thinking and hallucinatory experiences could have easily caused him to convince himself he was somehow responsible for the boy's death when in fact he was not,' defense psychologist Bruce Frumkin wrote. He said Hernandez's psychological problems and intellectual limitations put him 'at much greater risk than others' of falsely confessing. Prosecutors dispute his conclusion, and they asked a judge this month to limit any potential false confession expert testimony to factors accepted by the 'scientific community,' citing a New York legal standard. Hernandez's lawyer, Harvey Fishbein, said in court papers the testimony will meet the criteria. Prosecutors haven't disclosed their own psychologists' evaluations. But they've noted that Hernandez was never hospitalized for psychological problems before his arrest and that he'd shown the mental wherewithal to hold jobs, apply for government benefits and discuss religion.","Etan Patz disappeared in 1979 walking to his school bus stop in New York .

"Today's Mulberry show, held at noon in Claridge's, begun, as has become tradition, with a Bloody Mary-fuelled drinks reception where air kissing and catwalk catch-ups create a hubbub that whips up pre-show excitement to fever pitch. One of the buzzier events on the LFW calendar, it's quite an occasion even before the clothes reach the catwalk. Today though, the anticipation was perhaps even more tangible, given that this was to be Creative Director Emma Hill's last for the British design house. She's back! Cara Delevingne leads out the models at Mulberry creative director Emma Hill's last show . Elegant: Cara Delevingne sported a beautifully tailored short suit and a pailette-embellished white dress . Floral: Hill's graphic blooms were used liberally on dresses . Cool crimson: Patriotic scarlet and white dominated the palette . Retro: Hill's old fashioned Marimekko style prints were a hit . Cool canines: In true Mulberry style, designer-clad dogs accompanied the models onto the catwalk . Best accessory: Turbo the Mulberry bulldog was one of the stars of the show . Contrast: Nubuck and suede introduced gentle structure while bold blooms on silk brought a country garden feel. I loved the bold orange platforms, which picked out orange splashes throughout the collection . New favourite: The Willow given an update for SS14 with embroidery . Want...it...now: Clutch in fiery orange . Hill announced her departure from the . company in June, making this her swansong collection. The moodboard, . which in these plugged-in times was shared by Mulberry via email and . social networking before the show, spoke of quintessentially English tea . time, ditzy florals in china print tempered by soft pinks, blues and . greys. And that was . indeed what was delivered: Clean-lined coats in floral jacquard, fluid . long-legged trousers in feather-light pavement grey silk, light summer . blues, ballet pink silk and bright textured whites. Then . came bolder florals - big blooms on silk tees and dresses, smaller . prints on a clutch. The colour palette was bold but streamlined - blue, . orange, cream, white, grey - with those same hues running through print . and trim. Nappa leather . shirts, trousers, skirts and jackets provided gentle structure with a . hint of edge. I loved a striped tee in midnight blue Nappa suede and its . matching skirt, also the elegant cream embroidered coats and pyjama silk . trousers and floaty blouses. This . being Mulberry, bags were standout too. The popular Willow was . reincarnated in silky midnight blue calf, embroidered with white raffia . flowers or in Nubuck stripes. The classic Bayswater was rendered in fiery orange or inky blue Nubuck stripes making it a must-have... again. And the large Kensal made an appearance in cream or summer blue velvet calf. Cara Delevingne opened the show, and was only slightly overshadowed by the two canine catwalk stars who walked in Mulberry coats. Last year's doggy star, a standard poodle called Max, came to watch, dressed in a plaid Mulberry cost and sporting a flawless new hairstyle - the best dressed on the front row perhaps? Anna Wintour seemed to think so - she was cooing over the dog as he tried to creep up on the catwalk. Proof that Ms Wintour is maybe not as icy as her reputation would suggest. With Wintour and her UK Vogue counterpart Alexandra Shulman in the front row, fashion's foremost editorial figures were represented. So too was the celebrity element, with Alexa Chung, she of Mulberry's Alexa satchel fame, taking her place alongside actor Douglas Booth and actresses Juno Temple and Rebecca Hall. Seal of approval: Anna Wintour, left, sat front row next to Conde Nast chairman Jonathan Newhouse . Animated: U.S. Vogue editor Anna Wintour looked excited to be at the show today . The FROW: Lea Seydoux, Rebecca Hall, Alexa Chung and Douglas Booth had a ringside seat at Mulberry . The show, which played out to a . soundtrack including Madness's Our House, a bit of Queen and the . children's party song, If You're Happy And You Know It, saw models step . through elegant doorways covered with ivy and climbing white roses, . bringing a stately home country garden feel to the hotel's interior. The . show notes said Mulberry 'revisited the style attitude 'Le Style . Anglais' with its laid back interpretation of heritage luxury'. 'The . new season is both town and country: the collection was influenced by . modernist overtones from Sixties London juxtaposed with the opulence of a . quintessential English country house and gardens,' they said. 'In . its style and attitude the collection embraced both familiarity and . modernity, working with classic prints and textures reinterpreted to . create new season signatures imbued with Mulberry's inherent British . wit.' Swansong: Creative Director Emma Hill walks out onto the catwalk to take a bow for the last time at Mulberry . It came to a . close to a rousing rendition of Land Of Hope And Glory, which saw fashion commentator Hilary . Alexander jigging along in time to the music. But Liz Jones, who was still . reeling after being accosted for a photo by a fan after the show ('I . don't usually get people telling me they like me!') said she would have . hoped for Hill to go out on more of a high. 'I didn't think it was her best, to be honest,' said the Daily Mail fashion columnist. 'There was a lot of very sticky out fabric. 'Some of the coats were nice, but there was some very thick fabric that is not easy to wear. The shoes were quite clumpy too.' But the celebrities, who are, after all the ones with the money to buy it, were more enamoured with the designs, with Alexa Chung declaring that she loved it all. For her part, Hill proved just how those 'tricky' fabrics and pieces should be worn when she stepped out to take her final bow. She wore a midnight blue Nappa leather jacket, cropped, short fur sleeves, with her jeans. Bowing out in style.

'I'm frightened,' said Tatyana Volchanskaya, a student in Volgograd, 700km (400miles) northwest of Sochi, the Black Sea resort where the Winter Games start on February 7. She said some friends were afraid to go to shops and other crowded places. Wounded: A man, who has sustained injuries to his head, arrives at hospital following the blast . This man, whose hands and face have been bandaged after the blast, was also wounded in the explosion . Vladimir Putin today vowed the total destruction of terrorists in a hard-hitting New Year message. 'I am certain that we will fiercely and consistently continue the fight against terrorists until their complete annihilation', he said in his annual televised address at midnight. The strongman rewrote his New Year address even as the start of 2014 rolled across Russia's nine time zones. 'We bow our heads before the victims of cruel terrorist acts,' he said in his revamped message which came on a day that funerals began for the bomb victims. His original address, heard by residents in the extreme east of Siberia, the first to see in the New Year, contained no reference to the bombings. Putin's new version was delivered from Khabarovsk - seven hours ahead of Moscow - in the Far East of Russia where he flew to celebrate the New Year with victims of summer flooding. 'In the current year, we have encountered problems and have been challenged by serious experiences, including ones like the inhuman acts of terror in Volgograd,' he said. His spokesman said he 'broke a longstanding tradition' in ripping up his original message to deliver his uncompromising warning to Islamic extremists who are blamed for the Volgograd carnage. The attacks posed a challenge to President Vladimir Putin, who oversaw a war that drove rebels from power in Chechnya over a decade ago but has been unable to quell the Islamist insurgency that erupted in its wake. Volgograd - formerly Stalingrad - is a city of about 1million and a transport hub for an area of southern Russia that includes Chechnya and the other mostly Muslim provinces of the North Caucasus, where the insurgency generates deadly violence almost every day. A car bomb killed a prosecutor's assistant in Dagestan, a hub of Islamist militancy in the Caucasus, on Tuesday, and two people were killed in a bomb blast there late on Monday, authorities said. Putin has staked his prestige on the Games in Sochi, which lies at the Western edge of the Caucasus Mountains and within the strip of land the insurgents want to carve out of Russia and turn into an Islamic State. He ordered increased security nationwide after the attacks, the deadliest outside the North Caucasus since a suicide bomber from a province next to Chechnya killed 37 people at a Moscow airport in January 2011. Volgograd was also the scene of an attack in October, when a woman from Dagestan killed seven people in a suicide bus blast. The violence raised fears of a concerted campaign before the Olympics, an important project for Putin, who secured Russia's first post-Soviet Games in 2007, during his initial 2000-2008 stint as president. Intended to showcase how Russia has changed since the collapse of Soviet communism in 1991, the Games have also been a focus for complaints in the West and among Russian liberals that Putin has stifled dissent and encouraged intolerance. This month, Putin freed jailed opponents . including oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky and the Pussy Riot punk band . in what critics said was an effort to disarm Western criticism and . improve his image. In an online video posted in July, the Chechen leader of insurgents who want to carve an Islamic state out of mainly Muslim provinces south of Volgograd, urged militants to use 'maximum force' to prevent the Games from going ahead. International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach condemned the 'despicable attack on innocent people' and said he had written to Putin to express condolences and confidence that Russia would deliver 'safe and secure games in Sochi'. The U.S. government is concerned Islamist militants may be preparing attacks aimed at disrupting the Olympics and has offered closer co-operation with Russia on security.","87 people detained after they resisted police or could .

"Killed: The American Ambassador Chris Stevens died in the attack by Al-Qaeda militants on the US Consulate in Benghazi on September 11 . Officials feared the US Consulate in Benghazi was vulnerable to a 'co-ordinated attack' and had convened an 'emergency meeting' just weeks before Ambassador Chris Stevens was killed in an assault by Al-Qaeda, a classified cable reveals. Mr Stevens and three other Americans were killed in a six-hour, commando-style attack on the US Mission in the Libyan city on September 11, for which Al Qaeda in North Africa and Islamist militia Ansar al-Sharia were implicated. Classified cables obtained by Fox News reveal concerns expressed by the State Department's senior security officer in an emergency meeting on August 15 that the consulate could not be protected. It also said that consular staff knew Al-Qaeda and their affiliates were running ten training camps in Benghazi and that an attack was likely. 'RSO (Regional Security Officer) expressed concerns with the ability to defend Post in the event of a coordinated attack due to limited manpower, security measures, weapons capabilities, host nation support, and the overall size of the compound,' the cable said. The consulate's Emergency Action Committee had been briefed 'on the location of approximately ten Islamist militia and AQ (Al-Qaeda) training camps within Benghazi' and had asked the consulate in the capital Tripoli for 'additional physical security upgrades.' The cable suggested there was no . specific evidence that the US consulate would be attacked but warned . that the Libyan Government was in danger of losing control in Benghazi. It . states: '...did not have information suggesting that these entities . were targeting Americans but did caveat that (there was not) a complete . picture of their intentions yet. 'RSO . noted that the Benghazi militias have become more brazen in their . actions and have little fear of reprisal from the (government of . Libya).' Gutted: Secret cables have revealed that officials based in Benghazi feared a 'co-ordinated attack' on the consulate . Scene of destruction: Glass, debris and overturned furniture inside the Benghazi consulate. An emergency meeting had been held over security concerns three weeks before the attack . In a further three-page cable sent on the day he died, Mr Stevens wrote about 'growing problems with security' in Benghazi and 'growing frustration' with the security forces and Libyan police, who were 'too weak' to guarantee their security. The US State Department said it would investigate the attack. The revelations follow a message posted on Facebook by Navy SEALs claiming that President Obama denied them back-up as militants overran Benghazi. The social networking site twice removed the message, which was contained in a meme suggesting Obama had relied on the SEALs when he wanted to kill Osama Bin Laden, but had denied them help when they called for it in Libya. The message was posted by the . Special Operations Speaks PAC (SOS), an organisation founded by Special . Operations veterans dedicated to protecting forces at home and abroad, . and was shared 30,000 time within 24 hours of being posted. It . reignited the debate over how much the administration knew about the . circumstances of the Benghazi attack and could influence the result of . this month's presidential election. Astonishing claim: This message posted on Facebook suggested that President Obama denied SEALs back-up in Benghazi . Also last week, ex-Navy SEAL Tyrone Woods, part of a small team at the CIA annex about a mile from the consulate, claimed he twice asked his superiors if he could go and assist the consular staff during the attack but was denied. Sources claimed a desperate last request for military assistance made by the CIA when they were attacked was denied, even though elite counter-terrorism units were only two hours away. Woods and two others defied the . orders and made their way to the consulate, by this time ablaze, and . started firing on the attackers.

The footage was shown as part of an . attempt by the CIA to provide the fullest account yet of the deadly . assault, which left Stevens and three other Americans dead. It captured some of the last moments . of the ambassador's life, showing the attack on the consulate building . as well as Stevens being removed from the building as he suffered from . the injuries which would eventually kill him. Senator Dan Coats told CNN the video was 'combination of video from a surveillance camera and a drone'. He added: 'It gave us a good picture, from the surveillance standpoint, what was happening.'

Testimony: Acting CIA director Mike Morell pictured leaving the Senate hearing on Thursday . Mike Morell, . the acting CIA director who took over for disgraced boss David . Petraeus, told the committees that UN ambassador Susan Rice had been . provided with an . unclassified version of what happened during the deadly September attack . in Libya that was incorrect. Emerging from the session, Democratic . Rep. Adam Schiff said Morell told the panel that Rice was given an . initial assessment that a spontaneous protest over an anti-Muslim video . evolved into an attack on the consulate.

Senate Republicans vowing to block her nomination if she is tapped to . replace Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.

Watching the watchers: Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, pictured today in Bangkok, Thailand, asked service chiefs to review ethics training for military officers in the wake of the controversy surrounding Petraeus . Meanwhile, Clinton will testify . before the congressional committee next month on the handling of the . deadly September 11, attack, which was carried out on the 11th . anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in New York and Washington. Republican Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, chairwoman of the House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs, said: 'The . secretary has committed to testifying before our committee... on the . Accountability Review Board's report, which is expected to be concluded . by early to mid-December.' But all eyes will be on Washington tomorrow, as Petraeus himself will testify on the Benghazi attack, appearing in public for the first time since news of the sex scandal broke. The news came as Defense Secretary Leon Panetta asked service chiefs to review ethics training for military officers in the wake of the controversy surrounding Petraeus, who resigned in disgrace last year after admitting he had an affair with his biographer. Panetta said he was unaware of any other top brass who could turn out to be ensnared in the debacle. Involved: . During the FBI's search, they also discovered 'inappropriate' and 'flirtatious' emails between Jill Kelley and Gen John . Allen, pictured with his wife Kathy and  daughter Bobbie . The socialite: Jill Kelley is believed to have exchanged flirtatious emails between her and Gen Allen . One person missing from the tableau: . Afghan war chief Gen John Allen, whose nomination to take over in . Europe is on hold because of suggestive emails that turned up in the . investigation of the Petraeus affair. Allen is under investigation over flirtatious emails he is believed to have exchanged with Jill Kelley, a Florida socialite and friend of Petraeus who has since been thrust right to the middle of the scandal. Legislators went ahead with a hearing on the nomination of Gen Joseph Dunford to replace Allen in Afghanistan. But with Allen's own future . uncertain, they put off consideration of his promotion to U.S. European . Command chief and NATO supreme allied commander. Allen had initially been scheduled to testify. Scandal: Petraeus and Paula Broadwell, pictured, conducted an affair from November 2011 until July 2012 - forcing his resignation when details were made public . Panetta, speaking at a news . conference in Bangkok, gave new words of support to Allen, voicing 'tremendous confidence' in the general. Citing a string of ethical lapses by . senior military officers, however, Panetta asked the Joint Chiefs of . Staff to review ethics training and look for ways to help officers stay . out of trouble. Petraeus said on Thursday that his resignation had nothing to do with what happened in Benghazi, and how he is determined to make his marriage work. Breaking his silence almost a week after he dramatically stepped down, Petraeus also revealed he has not spoken to his mistress, Paula Broadwell, since the scandal emerged and denied he had ever given her classified military documents. He maintained that his shock resignation on Friday had nothing to do with hearings about the terrorist attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, which he was due to testify at this week. Speaking out: David Petraeus, whose affair with biographer Paula Broadwell led to his resignation last week, has said he is committed to making it work with his wife and acknowledges his mistake . Instead, Petraeus, speaking with HLN reporter Kyra Phillips, said he stepped down as he was deeply remorseful about the affair and the only honorable thing left to do was to admit his failings. And, relaying her conversations with Petraeus to HLN on . Thursday, Phillips said he was now focusing on repairing the damage . inflicted on his family, including his two adult children, Anne and . Stephen. He admitted to . her that he had 'screwed up terribly' and that he 'felt fortunate to . have a wife who is far better than he deserves,' Phillips said. 'He knows he made a big mistake,' she said. 'He does . want to move forward making things work with his family. He doesn't want . to throw 37 years out the window with his wife.' Family: Petraeus said he hopes he can work things out with his wife Holly, pictured with their children in 2004 . Sweethearts: Petraeus on the day he graduated from the U.S. Military Academy in 1974, with Holly . 'This woman is strong,' she added of Holly Petraeus. 'She knows what she wants. She's . obviously, according to people that know her well, not happy about this . - very, very upset about this. 'I do not know if she's committed to . working this out with Petraeus... But I . do know that Dave Petraeus does not want to throw 37 years away and . would really like to make this work and make things right with his . family.' Petraeus, 60, revealed . very little about his ten-month affair with Broadwell, . which ended in July, but said they had not spoken since Friday. 'They have not talked since this story . broke,' Phillips said. 'They talked a couple of times when he ended this relationship . which was a couple [of] months ago. But they have not talked since the . story broke.' These . previous conversations have been confirmed by sources who saw Petraeus . and Broadwell chatting at an intelligence event in Washington on October . 27, weeks after the start of the FBI probe.

"A teacher whose battles with school boards in conservative areas of New Jersey made her a reluctant symbol of the transgender rights movement, has died. She was 80. Lily McBeth died on September 24 near her home in Little Egg Harbor, New Jersey after a long illness, her daughter Maureen said. 'She was very much at peace with her life,' Maureen McBeth said. 'She just wanted to be who she was.' Lily McBeth, a transgender school teacher, sits in her home in Tuckerton, New Jersey in 2006. McBeth, a teacher whose battles with school boards in conservative areas of New Jersey made her a reluctant symbol of the transgender rights movement, died on September 24. McBeth was 80 . The former William McBeth had undergone sex reassignment surgery in 2005 after nine years of substitute teaching in Eagleswood Township, and she sought to continue in the job. But vocal opposition from some parents concerned about the impact of a transgender teacher on young students led to a contentious debate that ended with her rehiring. She later substituted at the Pinelands Regional school district as well. The schools' 2006 decisions to keep her on as a substitute were hailed around the nation as a model of tolerance and acceptance of transgender Americans. But she resigned in frustration in 2009 after getting only a handful of assignments. The schools said they had permanent substitutes and outside subs were only called when the permanent subs were unavailable. Steven Goldstein, founder of the Garden State Equality rights group, said McBeth never wanted to become a symbol of anything, but became one nonetheless. 'It is so much easier to understand an issue with a human face, and Lily became the human face of transgender rights for many people,' he said. 'She did so much to increase understanding and awareness of transgender people just by being strong and being who she was.' Lily McBeth, formerly William McBeth, poses for a photo in her home in New Jersey. She had undergone sex reassignment surgery in 2005 after nine years of substitute teaching in Eagleswood Township, and she sought to continue in the job . Goldstein called McBeth one of the most important figures in New Jersey civil rights history in the last two decades. After selling his physical therapy marketing company, William McBeth moved from Bucks County, Pennsylvania, to New Jersey, where he got a substitute teaching job in Eagleswood, a community 17 miles north of Atlantic City. After his 2005 surgery, he sought to return as a substitute, which drew vocal opposition from some parents. But many students were unfazed, particularly those that remembered her as a competent male teacher. McBeth was a ukulele player and an avid carver of wooden decoy ducks. She acted in local theater productions, sang in a church choir and was active in a group seeking to re-establish clam populations in Barnegat Bay. She donated her body to a medical school for research and physician training; funeral arrangements were private, her daughter said. In a 2009 interview, McBeth said she treasured interacting with students in the classroom. 'I tried to be an example of something you might want to be when you grow up: a kind, caring person,' she said.","Lily McBeth died on September 24 near her home in Little Egg Harbor, New Jersey after a long illness .
