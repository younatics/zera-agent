"Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said the Government is keen to have a 'serious discussion' about 'revenge pornography' Ministers are seriously considering a change to the law to protect women from ex-partners who publish explicit pictures of them on the internet. Chris Grayling, the Justice Secretary, told MPs yesterday that the Government was looking to take ‘appropriate action’ to tackle so-called ‘revenge porn’, which he described as a ‘big problem in our society’. Mr Grayling was speaking after a question in the Commons by Maria Miller, the former culture secretary, who is campaigning for action on revenge porn. Two weeks ago Mr Grayling told the Mail that it ‘was only right that we look at ways’ that existing sexual offences laws could be amended to outlaw it. There are about 30 websites in the UK used by ex-boyfriends and husbands to post intimate pictures of former lovers, but there is no specific law against the practice. Women usually find the images are impossible to completely remove from the internet, as they are often reproduced on other websites within minutes. Tory MP Mrs Miller said a law to ban revenge porn was urgently needed in the UK. She added: ‘This is a form of sexual violence against women. What I want to do is make sure we have the right legal protection in place for these women.’ The Ministry of Justice is now looking at how that could be addressed. Mr Grayling said the Government was ‘very open’ to having a ‘serious discussion’ about the practice with a view to ‘taking appropriate action’ when Parliament returns from its summer recess. The Justice Secretary said the uploading of sexually explicit media to the internet without the consent of the subject is becoming a bigger problem in Britain. Former culture secretary Maria Miller called for a change in the law to tackle the 'appalling practice' He said the Criminal Justice and Courts Bill could be the vehicle for any change. During justice questions in the Commons, Mr Grayling told Mrs Miller: ‘You have done a very important job in raising this issue. It’s clearly becoming a bigger problem. ‘What I’d say to you today is the Government is very open to having a serious discussion about this with a view to taking appropriate action in the autumn if we can identify the best way of doing so.’ Mrs Miller had asked: ‘Posting revenge pornography on the internet is an appalling crime. 'Do you agree that the law needs to change to ensure that perpetrators are properly punished and that perhaps the Criminal Justice and Courts Bill, currently in the Lords, could provide the Government an opportunity to do just that?’","Chris Graying warned the practice is becoming a bigger problem in Britain .

"It’s been one of the most highly anticipated PC games of 2013, yet with huge server issues following its launch in the US – the release of SimCity in the UK was overshadowed by its crippling servers. Credit where it’s due, however; Maxis have made a very good game. For those if you who haven’t been exposed to previous SimCity titles – these series of games focus on city building as the player assumes the role of City Major and all the responsibilities that come with it from harvesting resources, ensuring your ‘sims’ have enough power and water to live, garbage is cleared, sewage is removed and that your city doesn’t descend into a crime-filled, arson-loving metropolis. And it’s in the control of all these aspects that the real fun is had. Beautiful world: There is no escaping the fact that SimCity is a wonderful-looking game . When players first start the game they will be required to access one of a number of servers (a lot more now than on the first day of launch). One of the strange things about SimCity is that each server is standalone; meaning if you start a city of one server and then have to or want to access another server, your city will not move with you. Players will then be taken through the tutorial that runs you through the key foundations of running a city. This gives SimCity players of all experiences a good outline on how to begin running their own cities. Potential Mayors learn of city specialisation; where you can focus on the production of oil, coal, tourism, casinos and trade. City specialisation is all part of Maxis’ aim of bringing a more social aspect to SimCity unlike previous titles. Players can choose to start their own region or pick a zone within another players’ region – encouraging play with friends. Each zone has its own resources, some with high quantities of water, oil or coal allowing for one friend to focus on the production of one resource and sharing it amongst neighbours whilst another friend does the same. This is one great asset of SimCity; playing in the same region as friends or other players allows for more focussed city building, not to mention Great Works that multiple players can team up to research and build. Each Great Works; Arcology, International Airport, Space Centre and Solar Farm, has its own benefits to the region and is a key focus once your city of fully established. Lighting up the night sky: How you build your city is entirely up to you . Whilst building your city players are given constant feedback on how the city is developing through the all-new Glassbox Engine. Advisors will regularly pop up to offer advice whilst players can also zoom in to street level and see the happiness or complaints of its citizens. Various data maps offer key insights on how well your city is performing and allow for players to experience an unrivalled level of constantly available detail and help their city blossom. Old-school SimCity players will be glad that roads can now be curvy allowing players to give their city a more unique feel instead of the usual grid by grid. However the constraints on city size can render curved roads obsolete as players will find themselves designing cities to pack in as much urbanism as possible. Past SimCity titles catered for a lot more expansion and larger city size whereas the focus on city specialisation, sharing resources and social play has been at the detriment of the dream of a sprawling city housing multiple hundreds of thousands of sims. SimCity’s always-online DRM gameplay, requiring players to be constantly online to play, has been hot topic since it was announced in 2012 and even more so after the server troubles the US experienced. Sight for sore eyes: It's very rewarding watching your city come together and the camera offers a great view . However EA and Maxis rectified most, but not all issues prior to UK launch. Many users have had a few problems logging in or accessing their server of choice, so much so that EA are offering a free game on Origin to all those who have played SimCity up to the 18th March. A nice gesture, but one they should never have had to offer. SimCity is a fantastic game, offering great replay value and an engaged social experience. It’s been unfortunate that it’s suffered server troubles yet this doesn’t detract from the fact that this is a very well built game. A lot of fun can be had and there’s nothing more satisfying than ‘plopping’ down building after building and watching your city grow. SimCity is out now. SEE THE GAME IN ACTION HERE: .

"The dirty linen was out in public long before the local launderette cut off Parma’s credit and told the players to wash their own kit from now on. By that point, on Wednesday evening, the team bus had already been repossessed, £400,000 of medical and gymnasium equipment was gone in a bailiff’s van and an advert had appeared online. It showed a picture of a bench from the dressing room at the Stadio Ennio Tardini — or lot No 7, if you prefer. It will be auctioned with a base price of £1,465 on March 5, with the money going to the creditors of this broken club. ‘Sometimes it feels like football is having a joke with us,’ says Nicolo Babris, the editor of parmafanzine.it. VIDEO Scroll down for Parma leave the pitch for the last time in Serie A after 0-0 at Roma . Former Parma striker Hernan Crespo, now a youth team coach at the Italian club, fears for the future . A banner on the locked gates says the Ennio Tardini stadium is now ‘Closed for robbery’ A banner outside the club accuses former owner Ghirardi of causing ‘lasting damage’ A padlocked entrance of the Ennio Tardini stadium is a sorry sign as Parma look to go into bankruptcy . Moments earlier, Sportsmail’s taxi arrived at the club’s training ground and Babris’s was one of 25 faces pressed against the windows. They have been patrolling the gates for days, a mixture of journalists and supporters usually in place from 8am to 8pm. ‘We thought you might be Manenti,’ he says. Manenti is Giampietro Manenti, the unpopular new club president, though he is not the most responsible for the £145million of debts that smashed this club into pieces. Players and staff have not been paid since the summer; many creditors have waited longer than that. Those debts meant last Sunday’s game against Udinese was postponed because Parma could not pay their stewards. This weekend’s game at Genoa will go ahead but the players are likely to pay for their own hotel. Manenti made late arrangements for a coach after the squad spoke publicly about pooling their cars. These are bleak, rotten times for the club at the bottom of Serie A and it’s about to get worse. The mayor of Parma has been demanding a meeting with Manenti but the latter keeps cancelling. Administration appears certain and the local press predict this club will soon be dissolved and re-formed in amateur football.

In 1999, Parma won the UEFA Cup - its fifth European trophy in seven years. The team that defeated Marseille 3-0 in Moscow was littered with stars. PARMA (3-2-3-2): Buffon; Thuram, Sensini, Cannavaro; Baggio, Boghossian; Fuser, Veron, Vanoli; Crespo, Chiesa . Subs: Micillo, Sartor, Mussi, Apolloni, Fiore, Asprilla, Balbo . Manager: Alberto Malesani . There are fears that Parma, remarkably, might even have to pull out of the league midway through the season. ‘Of course you wonder how this mess was allowed to happen,’ Babris adds. ‘We had a good and sensible club not very long ago. Look what these people did to us.’ The story, in the first instance, goes back to the Nineties. Parma had been delightfully successful through the whole decade, picking up four European trophies as well as three Italian Cups and finishing runners-up in Serie A. Their squad included Gianluigi Buffon, Fabio Cannavaro, Lilian Thuram, Ariel Ortega, Juan Sebastian Veron, Faustino Asprilla and Hernan Crespo. When they were beaten by Rangers in the Champions League in 1999 it was a big result for the Scottish side. No one predicted how much they would have in common down the line. Parma supporters protest in the city ahead of their cancelled Serie A game against Udinese on Sunday . The supporters have been angered to see a once-great club fall to the point of near-oblivion this season . A fan hangs a sign reading 'Chiuso per Rapina' or 'Closed for Robbery' on the gates on Parma's stadium . Police officers look on as the supporters march through the streets in protest at the financial mismanagement . Parma's ground is closed off but they still have over 100 players on their books who have not been paid . For Parma, the route from the Champions League to here is odd and mysterious. When Tommaso Ghirardi bought the club for £21m during the 2006-07 season, the club’s gross debt was a manageable £12m. Since then Parma have acquired a barely believable playing staff of 240 players, with the vast majority out on loan, including Gianni Munari and Daniel Tozser at Watford. The Parma view has long been that ‘this is the project’ without detailed explanations of how the business would work, though it is understood the plan depends on paying little and sending players elsewhere to be developed. If the player comes good, the club can sell for profit. If not, the overheads per player are relatively low. However, as one well-placed source put it: ‘These were not just young players who would be very cheap with potential — some were 27, 28, 29, 30. These players will cost the club more money.’ The scale of the operation was reported in 2013 by Italian newspaper La Repubblica, who calculated more than 300 transactions had taken place for only £5.5million. The club has previously been described in the same pages as a ‘cattle market’. ‘Like everything else, there has been no transparency,’ Babris says. To that end, it is unclear how much that unique business model might be responsible for the mess the club finds itself in. The source added: ‘It is hard to say, but the feeling is that these transfers have really not been good.’ Signs that something was seriously amiss financially only came in the summer. Having finished sixth in Serie A last season, Parma were prevented from taking part in the 2014-15 Europa League because of an unpaid tax bill of €300,000. The club captain has placed blame firmly at the door of Parma's current president Giampietro Manenti . Alessandro Lucarelli says he would happily captain Parma in Serie D, which could be what the future holds . Ghirardi huffed and puffed but had no answer. In December, having run up such monstrous debts, he sold the club to Albanian businessman Rezart Taci for €1. Captain Alessandro Lucarelli claimed the squad felt ‘betrayed and taken for a ride’ by Ghirardi. Taci never met the players and also sold the club for €1 after less than two months as owner. In came Manenti and one of his first encounters with the squad proved memorable. ‘He showed us a bank document stating there was €100m available to invest in Parma,’ said Lucarelli. ‘We had some doubt.’ So far Manenti has offered only excuses for repeatedly missing meetings with Mayor Federico Pizzarotti, who said: ‘The rapport with Manenti is beyond repair.’ Public prosecutors have set a date of March 19 for a bankruptcy hearing and the seizures of property continue most days. On Wednesday, a member of club staff entered the training ground with two bags of toilet rolls, understood to have been bought with a collection from the players. The misery is all around this once big club, including the gates of the stadium which carry the banner: Chiuso per rapina. In English, ‘Closed for robbery’. Crespo, the club’s youth coach, summed it up. ‘We are in shambles,’ he said. ‘It’s difficult to see the club in this state. We’re having to take showers with cold water and my players have got ill.’ Emails to the club have gone unreturned, though Sportsmail has been told by a source that there might be a good reason — the company that leased Parma their computers and printers recently reclaimed the equipment. Dirty laundry is the least of Parma’s problems. Hernan Crespo is a youth coach at the club and said players have been getting ill due to a lack of hot water .

"If a male-only social network was launched that let men rate their former conquests in terms of attractiveness and sexual ability, it probably wouldn't go down very well. But somehow, a female-only equivalent is OK. Luluvise.com, which went live yesterday, is a social network, described as 'Sex And The City marries Facebook' - and it bans boys. Latest internet craze? Entrepreneur Alexandra Chong has set up Luluvise.com, a social network that is just for women . It connects through your Facebook . profile - although does not let any of your Facebook friends know that you have connected. 'Luluvise uses Facebook to make registration easier. We do not post to walls or make Luluvise information public anywhere or to other Facebook users,' creator Alexandra Chong explained. Once you've logged on you can see what other women have . said about your potential love interests. The site does serve other functions too - you can use it to send messages, photos or polls to groups of female BFFs ('Best Friends Forever'). But that is only likely to take off if people flock to the 'WikiDate Database'. Rate after dating: The site's most interesting - and controversial - feature lets women secretly rate their past conquests . Harsh? Luluvise lets you describe your first kiss with a former squeeze as 'slobber city' - or amazing . This is internet dating 2.0 - in that the first men that pop up are the ones who are already your friends on Facebook. But they will never know that you have rated them, and neither will anyone else. Some of the ratings do seem a little harsh. Particularly the ones that invite you to rate your first kiss as 'slobber city', or to summarise your sex life as 'All I could could think was...""Is he into girls?"".' But getting an insight into your male friends' romantic lives - even if you have no interest in bagging them at all - is bound to be popular. Not fair? Men cannot even see their ratings - unless they create a fake facebook profile in which they pretend to be a woman . The website, set up by Canadian entrepreneur Alexandra Chong, 30, in London, is already all over twitter. Cosmopolitan UK tweeted: 'If Carrie Bradshaw had signed up to #Luluvise, it would've saved her a LOT of heartache!' Men are unsurprisingly hankering to join. More than 500 boys have already submitted their . emails to get access to the site, but instead received an email reading: 'Hey Dude, you're a dude.' Circle of friends: The site also lets you set up a network of 'BFFs' who you can collectively ask questions, send messages and send photos . It is possible for men to get around the ban and see what women are saying about them - with a little dedication. They need to set up a fake Facebook profile as a woman, and make friends with themselves on that social network. Then, when they log onto Luluvise, their own ratings will pop straight up. But they will not be able to see private conversations. However, Luluvise has set up a series of strict rules in the backend technology that should prevent any fake Facebook accounts from accessing the site. The site's first 1,000 legitimate users came from across the globe, with 69 countries represented on the platform. The majority were split across the US, UK and Canada.","Luluvise connects though Facebook .

"Rev. Al Shaprton, the controversial civil rights leader-turned-broadcaster, was a confidential FBi informant for years and helped the feds put members of the Genovese and Gambino organized crime families behind bars, it was revealed Monday in a sensational exposé. President Barack Obama will speak this . week for the second time at the annual meeting of Sharpton's National . Action Network. New allegations published by The Smoking Gun allege that beginning in the 1980s, Sharpton worked as an informant for many years on mob groups for an organized crime task force made up of FBI agents and detectives with the New York Police Department. In fact it was some of those investigators who gave Sharpton up, providing the documents to the website known for seeding the Internet with groundbreaking papers exposing details of court cases that embarass celebrities. Sharpton has been part of President Obama's inner circle since his days as an Illinois state legislator -- long before the wayward reverend defended his friend nightly on MSNBC . Vincent 'Chin' Gigante (C) was a Genovese crime family boss who pretended to be mentally ill in order to escape responsibility for his crimes -- but Sharpton helped foil his plot when he taped other mob figures discussing the ruse . Checkered past: A more hirsute Sharpton (in blue track suit, C) advised the rape-hoaxer Tawana Brawley in 1998 and led marches on her behalf before her claims were unmasked as a fraud . '[O]ne Gambino crime family figure became so comfortable with the protest leader that he spoke openly – during ten wired face-to-face meetings – about a wide range of mob business,' The Smoking Gun reported Monday. That included everything 'from shylocking and extortions to death threats and the sanity of Vincent ""Chin"" Gigante, the Genovese boss who long feigned mental illness in a bid to deflect law enforcement scrutiny. 'As the mafioso expounded on these topics, Sharpton’s briefcase--a specially customized Hartman model – recorded his every word.' Sharpton denied his law enforcement ties on Saturday when The Smoking Gun asked him point-blank about it. He claimed his only link with the FBI was related to drug dealing cases in minority communities and recording industry efforts to cheat black artists in the recording industry. But when asked whether he recorded his conversations with a Gambino mob family member, he would only say, 'I'm not saying yes, I’m not saying no.' Veteran investigators who tracked Genovese crime family members for a living told The Smoking Gun that Sharpton, now 59, brought a specially-equipped Hartman briefcase to meetings with that mobster, recording the conversations and later handing the tapes over to the feds. Sharpton's National Action Network, which will host Obama on Friday, has skirted responsibility for $1.9 million in . back taxes and penalties it has owed the IRS since a 2006 investigation into improper tax reporting. He . also owes more than $888,000 in personal debts related to a failed 2004 . presidential campaign, and $100,000 more in related debts to . the federal government. There are strong personal ties between Sharpton and Barack Obama, including several Oval office visits on topics as diverse as jobs and education – mostly with other black community leaders. Sharpton was also on hand for first lady Michelle Obama's 50th birthday party as a guest of hte Obamas. And he had a seat near the guest of honor at a State Dinner this year honoring French President Francois Hollande. He brought his girlfriend, a woman barely half his age. Vincent 'Chin' Gigante died in 2005 while serving a 12 year prison sentence after finally admitting he wasn't insane. This mug shot dates from 1960, when he was convicted at age 32 of helping mob boss Vito Genovese run a narcotics ring . Rev. Al Sharpton, president of the National Action Network, commands the attention of leaders like New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (center R) and police commissioner William Bratton (C) , perhaps because he has helped the city make cases against mob bosses . But court affidavits and other papers The Smoking Gun published on Monday indicate that he also provided information to federal investigators that helped them persuade judges to authorize phone tapping and audio bugs at two Genovese family 'social clubs,' including Vincent Gigante’s headquarters in New York City's Greenwich Village. They also put bugs in three cars and more than a dozen phone lines, largely because of information Sharpton provided, yielding information used in a major racketeering case against the Genoveses. One such case targeted Federico 'Fritzy' Giovanelli, a Genovese soldier was drew a 20 years in prison sentence for racketeering; recordings made because of information Sharpton provided were played in open court. Giovanelli later said he had no idea Sharpton was related to his case. 'Poor Sharpton,' he laughed: 'He cleaned up his life and you want to ruin him.' The Smoking Gun claimed Monday that Sharpton became an FBI informant after he was 'flipped' – meaning that he was promised special legal treatment - perhaps immunity from prosecution - in exchange for his cooperation. That case reportedly involved a 1983 sting operation aimed at boxing promoter Don King, who was convicted on second-degree murder in 1966, a host of elected officials, 'and . several powerful New York hoodlums involved in concert promotion, record . distribution, and talent management.' President Barack Obama spoke at the 20th anniversary National Action Network Gala on April 6, 2011, and plans to return this week for a repeat performance . Golden boy: Sharpton has been untouchable despite his group's tax debts and his $888,000 in personal debts related to a failed 2004 presidential campaign . The White House did not respond to a question about whether the president will keep his speaking engagement at the National Action Network. That group also did not respond to a request for comment. Sharpton claimed in his 2013 book 'The Rejected Stone' that he never informed for the government, saying that any attempt to paint him as a snitch was a ploy to squelch his loud voice in the civil rights movement. He was once 'set up by the government,' he said, when agents leaked 'false information' that 'could have gotten me killed.'","Sharpton has been a political ally of Barack Obama for two decades, and the president will speak to his civil rights group this week .

"According to his peers, Eden Hazard has been the most consistent player in the Premier League since he signed for Chelsea. But to win his elusive first trophy for the club he has be more influential in Sunday's Capital One Cup final than another dangerous creator/goalscorer – Tottenham's Christian Eriksen. Hazard, 24, was named in both the 2013 and 2014 PFA Premier League teams of the year, an accolade only Luis Suarez matched. Suarez is now in Spain while Hazard is odds-on to be picked again for this season's all-star line-up. His nine goals and six assists in the Premier League this season have helped Chelsea top the league and also have him top of most Fantasy Football charts, scoring more points than even Diego Costa and Sergio Aguero. Chelsea's Eden Hazard (right), pictured in action against Burnley, is set to start against Tottenham on Sunday . Spurs midfielder Eriksen gets away from Fiorentina's Micah Richards in the Europa League on Thursday . But something is missing for the Belgian – silverware. Chelsea have won one trophy since he signed in the summer of 2012, and he missed the Europa League final win the following year under Rafa Benitez because of a hamstring injury. In theory, Wembley should be a perfect stage for him to offset his talents. His ability to dribble at speed past defenders with a low centre of gravity is second only to Lionel Messi. There is end product too – he has had 52 shots this season. Although he hasn't won a cup yet, he has shown he is a big-match player. He destroyed Pablo Zabaleta when Chelsea beat Manchester City at The Etihad Stadium last season, and set up Chelsea's goal in the corresponding fixture there this season. When Chelsea played City at Stamford Bridge last month, Manuel Pellegrini picked Bacary Sagna at right-back rather than subject his experienced Argentine World Cup finalist to any more punishment from Hazard. Hazard has already scored against Tottenham this season, having netted in Chelsea's 5-3 defeat in January . Eriksen's stunning free-kick at Bramall Lane helped Spurs beat Sheffield United in their semi-final . Kyle Walker faces a huge test to stop the motivated Hazard this weekend. Although Spurs beat Chelsesa 5-3 at White Hart Lane on New Year's Day, they will remember their trip to Stamford Bridge the previous month. Hazard was at his imperious best and scored a cracking opening goal in Chelsea's 3-0 victory. Fortunately for Spurs, they believe they have their own Hazard equivalent in their young Super Dane Christian Eriksen. While most of the signings made by Spurs to replace Gareth Bale have flopped, Eriksen has been an unqualified success, and is arguably as important to them in the big picture as centre-forward Harry Kane who is grabbing all the headlines. Eriksen has scored the same number of league goals as Hazard, nine, and while he only has one direct assist, his strikes are even more important than his rivals, often coming late to save or win matches. He has won 18 points for Tottenham – compared to Hazard's 10. Overall, he has scored 16 goals in 48 league games for Spurs, and doesn't take penalties to boost his tally. Hazard, pictured celebrating against Derby in the quarter-finals, has been influential for Chelsea this season . Eriksen's goals have earned Tottenham a massive 18 points in the Premier League so far this season . At 23 and having been educated at Ajax under Dennis Bergkamp, Eriksen can thread passes like a traditional No 10, drift out wide to cause problems and most notably is stunning at set-pieces. His most important one helped take Spurs to Wembley in the first place – a magnificent free-kick at Sheffield United in the semi-final. Eriksen ended up scoring both Tottenham's goals in a 2-2 draw at Bramall Lane that took them into the final 3-2 on aggregate, latching onto Harry Kane's pass in the 86th minute for what turned out to be the 'winner'. John Terry and the Chelsea defence will be aware that any foul on Kane could be punished by Eriksen's accuracy from free-kicks. There will be plenty of big names and potential match-winners on show for the first major final of the season – Diego Costa, Harry Kane and perennial big-match player Branislav Ivanovic among them. But the destination of the cup might eventually come down to which of the two quicksilver midfield magicians hits the heights – Eden Hazard or Christian Eriksen.","Chelsea and Tottenham meet in the Capital One Cup final on Sunday .

"Fussy shoppers are a major cause of food waste, Tesco claimed yesterday. The supermarket giant said UK customers ‘always pick the cream of the crop’, forcing it to bin thousands of tons of old or misshapen produce. Its Eastern European customers are, by contrast, more willing to accept less than perfect food. Blamed: A spokesman for Tesco supermarket said 'fussy' customers are the main cause of wasted food . Confusing sell-by dates and promotions have been blamed for much of the growth in waste. But . Matt Simister, food sourcing director at Tesco, told a House of Lords . inquiry into the issue that customers were also at fault. Even though EU rules on misshapen fruit and veg were relaxed in 2009, supermarkets still maintain the higher product standards. Mr Simister said: ‘The standards are there because that’s what customers tell us they want in their perishable produce. Tesco said its Eastern European customers are, by contrast, more willing to accept less than perfect food . ‘Customers naturally select, they always pick the cream of crop first and the rest of it then gets left. 'Then the new deliveries come in and you have the new cream of the crop – the old, ugly misshapen produce goes to waste. 'Customers will always make the choice of the one that cosmetically looks better. That’s a very difficult reality to us.’ Mr Simister said Tesco would try to . persuade more people to buy misshapen fruit and vegetables, including by . using more cut-price deals. He . acknowledged the industry had a role in ‘educating’ people to accept . that wonky carrots and blemished apples were ‘perfectly good food’. But . he said the retailer sends much of its misshapen produce to its outlets . in Eastern Europe, where customers on tighter budgets do not object. In October, Tesco revealed that it generated almost 30,000 tons of food waste in the first six months of the year. It . found that up to two thirds of supermarket food ends up in the bin, . including 68 per cent of bagged salads, half of bakery goods and a . quarter of grapes. Much of the food is thrown away by customers but large amounts are lost because they have been on display too long. Tesco revealed that it generated almost 30,000 tons of food waste in the first six months of the year . Two in five apples and a fifth of bananas are never eaten. The supermarket has now scrapped confusing ‘display until’ dates on fresh fruit and vegetables, and ended buy one get one free offers on salads. Mr Simister said: ‘We can put more misshapen products through our value range at better prices, we’ve been doing that for years. There are opportunities to do more. ‘It’s less easy to be flexible with the standard ranges, but we can be more flexible with the product that flushes through the stores at a good price for customers. ‘We do have a role to educate people. It’s weak to just do what customers think. Our role is to [help them] to make the right choices.’ Small marks on the skin of fruits do . not affect their flavour, but farmers complain that supermarkets will . often reject blemished produce. Apples with slight blemishes or russetting, which makes them too red for the supermarkets, are routinely rejected. Other . fruit is dumped for having small marks, despite the absence of any . impact on taste. Vegetables have to meet certain size and shape . standards. Farmers complain they can have up to 40 per cent of their crop rejected for ‘cosmetic’ reasons. Food . waste has risen sharply up the political agenda following a series of . reports showing vast quantities of supermarket food are thrown away, . either by customers or the stores themselves. Tesco researchers found that up to two thirds of supermarket food ends up in the bin, including 68 per cent of bagged salads, half of bakery goods and a quarter of grapes . In . January, the Institution of Mechanical Engineers said that up to half . the food bought in the West was binned. It said the waste was being . caused by poor storage, strict sell-by dates, bulk offers and consumer . fussiness. Last . month the Government’s Waste and Resources Action Programme said . families waste £60 a month by throwing the equivalent of almost a meal a . day into the bin.

"Small town horror: Amateur detective Jessica Fletcher, played by Angela Lansbury, encounters a shockingly large number of killings in Murder, She Wrote . The idyllic seaside town of Cabot Cove looks at first glance like a pleasant and relaxing place to live. In fact, it is the murder capital of the world and far more dangerous than the most violent parts of the globe, including Honduras in Central America. Thankfully, it is just the fictional New England setting for popular TV series Murder, She Wrote. Amateur detective Jessica Fletcher, played by Angela Lansbury, encountered a total of 274 killings in the small town in Maine, despite it having a population of just 3,500. This gives it an annual murder rate of 1,490 per million — more than 50 per cent higher than Honduras, where it is 910 per million. In the last two years 1,000 women have been murdered in the country - and 90 percent were not even investigated. And Cabot Cove was even further ahead . of El Salvador, a country which recently celebrated a unique milestone - . its first day in three years when nobody was murdered. Around five people were murdered in the fictional coastal spot every year, according to BBC Radio 4's More or Less. ITV detective series Midsomer Murders also has an exceptionally high murder rate, on a par with Chile and Latvia. Researchers . working out the figures assumed the county of Midsomer, where the . action was set, would probably have a similar population size to . Oxfordshire, where it is filmed. They then worked out that it would have an annual murder rate of 32 per million. That is three times the rate that Thames Valley Constabulary reports for Oxfordshire. Midsomer experiences around 2.6 killings per episode over around eight episodes a year, meaning 21 murders were committed there each year. Investigation: Jessica encountered a total of 274 killings in the small town in Maine, despite it having a population of just 3,500 . The reality: Soldiers flee clashes with civilians after a deadly prison battle in Honduras . Los Angeles in the 1970s was the setting for many popular crime series - yet these shows had a far lower murder rate than the city did in reality. Columbo, Quincy, Perry Mason, Jim . Rockford and Jonathan and Jennifer Hart all hunted killers on LA's mean . streets during that decade. The murder rate across all those series was 29 per million, while in real life, it was 230 per million. Sting in the tale: John Nettles, left, as Tom Barnaby in Midsomer Murders . The Murder of Sherlock Holmes (1984): Pilot. Jessica is shocked to find out her manuscript has been accepted. Then she attends a costume party and a private investigator dressed as Sherlock Holmes ends up face-down in a swimming pool, shot.Deadly Lady (1984): After a terrible storm in Cabot Cove, Stephen Earl's four daughters tell Sheriff Tupper that their father died while they were out on the boat. Jessica has to wade through the inconsistencies in the four Earl daughters' storylines to determine who killed their father. Dead Man's Gold (1986): A group of treasure hunters come to Cabot Cove looking for sunken gold but after one dies and the other is arrested for her murder, Jessica gets involved to clear a young man she believes is innocent and to help a friend she knows tends not to be. Town Father (1989): Scandal abounds during election time in Cabot Cove when the Mayor is reputed to have a secret wife who comes to confront him with murderous results.  Joshua Peabody Died Here... Possibly (1985): Plans for a new hotel in Cabot Cove have to be put on hold when a skeleton is discovered at the construction site and Amos and Jessica find a second body. Busy patch: The ratio of killings in British series Midsomer Murders, featuring new character DCI John Barnaby, is closer to that of countries such as Chile and Latvia than Oxfordshire, where it is filmed . As David Crawford writes in the Radio Times: 'If you want reassurance that the world is . not such a frightening place, watch an American, urban detective drama . from the 70s. 'But if you want the beejaysus scaring out of you, watch . Angela Lansbury.' The findings were calculated by Open University statisticians for Radio 4 mathematics programme 'More or Less'.","Cabot Cove has a higher murder rate than violent country Honduras .

"Gary Hunt has done the UK proud after he was crowned the Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series champion for 2014. The 30-year-old thrillseeker won the final event of the tournament, his fourth triumph of the season, at Kil Cenote on Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula to take the title. With exactly 500 points, he beats the 2013 World Series winner Artem Silchenko, in second, and the USA’s David Colturi, in third place. Gary Hunt of the UK dives from the 27 metre platform during the seventh and final stop of the Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series . Second placed Artem Silchenko (left) of Russia, 2014 World Series winner Gary Hunt (centre) of the UK, and third placed David Colturi (right) of the USA celebrate with their trophies during the seventh and final stop of the Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series . And in this video, Hunt's successes are highlighted by his fellow competitors, and we get a closer look at some of the intricacies of his dangerous diving. 'Gary is just unreal to watch him dive,' says one of his colleagues, while another adds: 'His skills are something incredible.' 'Gary Hunt, you are the man,' Orlando Duque, 10-time world champion pays the ultimate compliment when he says: 'People like that in sports, not only in our sport, come very few times, and I'm happy that we have him in our sport and that he's pushing it to the point he has.' Speaking after his victory, the Southampton-born diver said: 'The plan worked perfectly. I really wanted to win here after twice winning the World Series and not being on top of the podium at the final event. 'I wanted it so much and on the platform I really felt the nerves, and so I’m over the moon that I got it. 'Losing the title last year was a big motivation for me. I wouldn’t be the diver that I am today if I had not suffered that disappointment.' There was delight for the UK diver after Hunt reversed last year's final placings with Russia's Artem Silchenko to walk away with the 2014 prize . After Friday's women's finals, on Saturday it was the turn of the men as 14 cliff divers dove into the crystal-clear waters of the sinkhole in the Mexican jungle during a total of four rounds of competition. Divers jump from a platform at a height ranging from 26-28 m (85-92ft). Hunt's superb execution of his famed triple quad dive, with a degree of difficulty of 6.2, in the final saw the judges produce 9s and the Englishman secure a grand total of 500.00 points. With two 10s from the judges for the intimidating flying inward dive, Russia’s Artem Silchenko (451.60pts) set the course for another podium finish after his victory at the previous World Series stop in Spain. David Colturi (451.30pts) performed strongly in the second part of the season to finish the year with a third place. Hunt, pictured at an earlier event, said he was 'over the moon' after scooping the title after losing out last year . The Southampton-born diver certainly has the respect of his rivals after yet more success . Hunt secured four wins out of seven in this year's World Series as he walked off with the silverware . Ten-time world champion Orlando Duque has described his pride that Hunt (pictured) is with them in the sport . The top-three finish saw Colturi climb from seventh to fifth (610pts) in the final standings and with it guarantee automatic qualification for 2015. Four wins out of seven make Hunt (1,110pts) a very worthy four-time champion. The 2013 winner, Russia's Artem Silchenko, finished runner-up not only in Mexico but also the overall standings (860pts).

"Crystal Palace winger Yannick Bolasie has revealed that a move to Malta in 2007 kick-started his football career and diverted his path away from becoming a carpenter. The DR Congo international was not always plying his trade in the Premier League, instead working his way up the leagues from humble beginnings at Hillingdon Borough. In fact, he was close to giving up before being offered the chance to play abroad; a move that saved his career. Yannick Bolasie is now a regular in the Premier League with Crystal Palace, but it wasn't always like that . The pacey winger (right) started out in non-League with Hillingdon Borough, before moving to Malta . Bolasie takes on Serge Aurier during DR Congo's Africa Cup of Nations semi-final clash in early February . 'Simply playing professional football is a dream come true, but if I hadn't made it as a player, I would've probably gone into carpentry,' Bolasie wrote on his blog for Sportlobster. 'This is what I was set up to do, before I went to play football in Malta. 'My girlfriend's dad and I were planning on working together, but I got the move to Floriana and the rest is history. I am pretty handy, though, and would've learned a lot more.' Handy, perhaps, is one word to describe Bolasie's talents on the pitch too... although that would be understating his ability. Bolasie is now enjoying life in the Premier League, pictured (right) celebrating with team-mate Dwight Gayle . At West Ham last season, a penalty from captain Mile Jedinak (right) was enough to secure a 1-0 win . The 25-year-old has been on top form this season, last weekend celebrating his 100th appearance in the red and blue of Palace. He recently returned from international duty with DR Congo, where he played a starring role in their Africa Cup of Nations campaign. Bolasie helped his country to third place, but attention has now turned from Equatorial Guinea to England, and more specifically to West Ham this Saturday. Bolasie spent three years in League Two with Plymouth Argyle after returning from Floriana in Malta . The 25-year-old celebrates after scoring for Palace against Everton at Goodison Park last season . 'We have good memories from the game last season, and hopefully it'll be a similar outcome,' Bolasie continues, referring to the Eagles' 1-0 win at Upton Park last April. 'We have top players and we were winning games while I was away in Africa, so West Ham will know we can cause them damage. 'They have great players too, but we know we can go there and win.'

"Police in Rotterdam detained 42 suspects before and after the highly charged Europa League match between Feyenoord and Roma, while fans throwing objects onto the pitch forced a temporary halt to the second half. Police said in a statement on Friday that they were 'satisfied with a busy day', spent preventing fights between rival fans amid fears of revenge attacks by Roma supporters for a riot in Rome a week earlier by Feyenoord hooligans. Feyenoord officials were far from satisfied after fans pelted the pitch with objects such as cigarette lighters and threw an inflatable banana toward the field during the match which Roma won 2-1.

The first leg of the last 32 tie had been marred by crowd trouble and Rotterdam police were out in force . 42 suspects were arrested before and after the match as police tried to calm the crowds . Coach Fred Rutten says 'Those sorts of things only hurt Feyenoord. It's a shame it happened.' Referee Clement Turpin was forced to to take both teams off the pitch amid concerns for the safety of the players in the 55th minute, following the controversial dismissal of Feyenoord's Mitchell Te Vrede for a challenge on Kostas Manola. The teams returned about 10 minutes later and almost immediately substitute Elvis Manu equalised for the Dutch side but Gervinho put Roma 2-1 in front three minutes later which was the final score, giving them a 3-2 win on aggregate.

"Eoin Morgan went range hitting  before displaying plenty of attacking intent off the field in backing his coach and under-performing No 3 and then defending his decision not to sing the national anthem at this World Cup. Plenty of sixes were hit in practice at the Basin Reserve before Morgan, who showed glimpses of a return to form in England’s win over Scotland, aimed a couple of big verbal blows in standing up for Peter Moores and Gary Ballance. Then the Irish captain of England addressed his reluctance to join in with God Save the Queen ahead of each game, in contrast to the bulk of his side who have been belting it out with gusto. England captain Eoin Morgan passes the ball in a game of touch rugby during an England nets session . Chris Woakes offloads the ball as England take a break from their nets session in Wellington . Morgan took part in practising his big shots at the Basin Reserve in Wellington . Morgan and his England team-mates were training ahead of Sunday's game with Sri Lanka . England face Sri Lanka on Saturday and the captain was robust in his defence of Ballance even though he has looked rusty in scoring 10 in each of his three World Cup games since being brought in at the last minute. Alex Hales has been ‘knocking hard on the door’ according to batting coach Mark Ramprakash and England, it seems, will wait until the last minute before they decide whether to stick or twist again, after ripping up their World Cup plans on the eve of their first game. ‘We’re three games into a World Cup,’ said Morgan, who has been given the team he wants in this tournament. ‘Gary came into the side four games ago and scored 70 (it was actually 57 in the final warm-up match against Pakistan). ‘He has played against two of the toughest teams in the World Cup and then dragged one on against Scotland. In my eyes he has been a bit unlucky. He hasn’t played a lot of cricket over the last month and I think any criticism of him at the moment is unfair. He’s a fantastic cricketer and has a huge amount of potential.’ Morgan charges up the field as England swapped the cricket ball for a rugby ball in the nets session . Morgan defended his decision not to join the rest of his team-mates in singing God Save the Queen . Gary Ballance has looked out of form . Ballance was left out of the one-day tour of Sri Lanka before Christmas and then broke his finger in practice when England first arrived in Australia, so he has been playing catch-up in this tournament. He showed last summer that he is on his way to becoming a special Test player and England believe that, in time, a batsman who averages more than 50 in domestic one-day cricket can be similarly effective at international level. The question is whether this World Cup is the right time to bed Ballance in to the one-day side or whether should England add more dynamism into the top order in the form of Hales, who is deserving of his chance now more than ever. Ravi Bopara, dumped on the eve of the first game but impressive in practice here, will also return to England’s thoughts. England, with one victory in their first three Group A games, are pretty much where everyone expected them to be at this stage but the scale of their defeats by Australia and New Zealand raised more questions over Moores. Moores was always likely to find himself under the spotlight in his second coming as coach but privately it is said that the players like and respect him and that he gets his message across to them, however unconvincing he is in public. His new one-day captain offered his support. ‘Mooresey has been completely different to Andy Flower, Ashley Giles or anyone else I have worked with before,’ said Morgan. ‘He brings a lot of energy to the side and a lot of ideas. ‘The basis of international cricket is trying to be one step ahead of the game, particularly as a coach, and he has been good in trying to find those little edges without taking away the basics since he’s been involved.’ The anthem issue is a contentious one because it throws up the whole dynamic of national identity, which is more complicated in cricket than most sports. Morgan is not the first nor the last international sportsman who has chosen not to sing (Darren Sammy was the only player to sing Rally Round the West Indies before the match against South Africa) but it has been noted in Morgan’s case because is a Dubliner now at the helm of the England side. Joe Root (left) and James Taylor (right) enjoy a game of touch rugby ahead of England's next match . England coach Peter Moores gives instructions during training in Wellington . Moores talks with bowler James Anderson during an England nets session at Basin Reserve . ‘It’s pretty simple,’ said Morgan. ‘I have never sung the National Anthem whether I’ve been playing for Ireland or England. It doesn’t make me any less proud to be an English cricketer. ‘I am extremely proud to be in the position I’m in and privileged to be captain of a World Cup side. It’s a long story but it’s a personal thing.’ Morgan chose not to tell that long story which is a shame because it leaves him open to conjecture as to why he will not exercise his vocal cords. But the bottom line is that it is his choice and it is better surely to be true to yourself rather than, as some dual nationals in England’s recent history have, belted out the anthem for effect. Stuart Broad talks with team-mate James Anderson during an England nets session at Basin Reserve . Anderson passes the ball in a game of touch rugby during an England nets session . There are plenty who would not care if Morgan hummed the Irish Rover under his breath while the anthem was being played as long as he scores runs and leads England to a victory over Sri Lanka that would all but guarantee their quarter-final place. It will not be easy. Sri Lanka defeated England in all forms last summer and then comfortably overcame them again in that one-day series before Christmas. And only on Thursday they demolished Bangladesh with Tillekeratne Dilshan smashing 161 and Kumar Sangakkara scoring a century in his 400th one-day international. England hope the swing here at the Westpac Stadium with which Tim Southee destroyed them against New Zealand can now work to their advantage. ‘Sri Lanka are in a good place at the moment,’ added Morgan. ‘It’s a test for us coming up again against their best cricketers, guys who have played 300, 400 games. We have done a lot of work on the possibility of the ball swinging throughout the first innings, as it did last time. We’ll be more than happy for the ball to swing around again now.","Eoin Morgan says coach Peter Moores  brings enegy and ideas to the team .

"Arsene Wenger backed striker Olivier Giroud to bounce back from his nightmare performance against Monaco with the Arsenal manager saying the French striker will not dwell on his horror show. The Gunners suffered a 3-1 first leg defeat at home in their Champions League last 16 encounter on Wednesday - a damaging result that means they will have to score at least three goals in the French principality on March 17 if they are to have any chance of reaching the quarter-finals. Giroud was guilty of missing two clear-cut chances for the north London outfit against Monaco, but Wenger insists the blame for the defeat should rest solely upon the 28-year-old's shoulders. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger says Olivier Giroud isn't to blame for their defeat to Monaco on Wednesday . Giroud (centre) watches on after missing a guilt-edge chance against Monaco in a frustrating display . Wenger found it painful viewing as his Arsenal side capitulated at home to Monaco on Wednesday . Speaking at the club's press conference on Friday, he said: ‘I hope not. He’s a strong character, Olivier, and personally I don’t blame him at all. We lost as a team. We fight for each other as a team. He worked hard for the team. He didn’t miss the chances on purpose. He wanted to score but it can happen. ‘He’s like everyone else - disappointed. There’s no one to blame individually. Which striker doesn’t miss chances? He has his chances and missed them. On the night everything went against us. Missing some chances was only one of the characteristics of the night. ‘What is important now is to respond well. We are on a strong run in the Premier League. We have to respond to that disappointment. I expect a strong response because it’s a different competition and we have an opportunity to stabilise our position in the top three. We want to take it.' The Arsenal boss is still adamant they could still come back from their 3-1 deficit to Monaco. ‘We are still in the competition, we have a difficult task but it’s still feasible,' he added. 'It looks a terrible week for English clubs in Europe. I don’t have any rational explanation for that. It’s just a shock that hits us. Is there any rationality behind that, I don’t know? ‘We have played over 180 games in the Champions League. We have fought very hard against Besiktas just to qualify. You could see Besiktas is a good team playing against Liverpool last [Thursday] night, so we won some important games. Dimitar Berbatov rolled back the years with a glorious finish as Monaco scored three away goals . Arsenal players look dejected during the match as they now face a daunting second leg comeback attempt . Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain gave the Gunners hope when he made the score 2-1 late on before Monaco's third . 'What is frustrating is that we have gone out in the last 16 in the last four years, but twice against the future winners of the competition. This time we are still not out. We are still in the Champions League - so don’t deal us out too quickly. ‘We have to live with the reaction and what is important is to give a strong response when we are a big club. We are a club who interest many people and that gives us a stronger responsibility and of course when you come out of a disappointing game like Wednesday night you don’t expect people to applaud. It’s absolutely normal we get criticised. What is hurting is the defeat, more than the criticism. I don’t say I’m immune to criticism. I love to win and when I don’t win I’m hurt of course.’ The 65-year-old also revealed he will make changes for this weekend's game against Everton. ‘I have not made any decision for Sunday’s game. We have to rotate a little bit because there is Sunday and Wednesday games. 'There will certainly be some changes. Everton have gone through but the Europa League and Premier League are different competition but we know that our strengths at home will be vital to strengthen our position. We have an opportunity we want to take.’ And he urged the fans to maintain their backing, despite the boos of Wednesday night. ‘You’re not a fan for one game for a fan for the club and no matter how big your club is you play 55 games a year and you have disappointing moments but we are third in the league, we’re on strong run. We’re not playing not to go down. We want to finish the season in strong way.’ Arsenal fans showed their displeasure by booing at the full-time whistle while some left early on Wednesday . Wenger has also revealed that Jack Wilshere has had a fresh surgical procedure to relieve some irritation on his injured ankle, which means he will be out for an additional two weeks. Wilshere, who was out for three months after damaging ankle ligaments against Manchester United in Novermber, only returned to the bench last weekend against Crystal Palace. But to support the ligaments in his recovery, doctors inserted tiny pins with studs in his ankle area – and these have now been removed. Wenger said: ‘He has little surgery on the ankle, a minor procedure as the studs on his ankle were irritating him. It was planned to be done at the end do the season but because it was an irritation, it was done now.’ Aaron Ramsey and Mathieu Flamini have returned to normal training but are ‘not completely ready’ according to Wenger while Mikel Arteta and Mathieu Debuchy remain threeweeks away from returning to fitness.

"Staff and visitors at Google's California campus were given a treat this week as the company took its driverless car prototype for a spin. The technology is still undergoing tests, and the firm hasn't announced when exactly the vehicles will become an addition to public roads because engineers are still ironing out a number of issues. But, that hasn't stopped the project's director Chris Urmson and his team demonstrating its potential to fans in Mountain View. Staff and visitors at Google's California campus were given a treat this week as the company showed off its driverless car prototype (pictured). The technology is still undergoing tests, and the firm hasn't announced when the vehicles will become common place on our roads as engineers are still ironing out issues . Mr Urmson is also hopeful the cars will be roadworthy within the next five years. One of the features said to be delaying the car's release is its inability to cope in heavy rain or snow. An insider told MIT Technology Review that the current prototype cars are very reliant on maps to navigate and can’t react like a human driver, dodging potholes and other hazards. The latest official figures from Google revealed the cars have already driven themselves for more 700,000 miles (1,126,540km), but they struggle to cope in snowy conditions and can't negotiate heavy rain. Mr Urmson said this is because the detection technology is not yet strong enough to separate certain objects from weather conditions. While the cars’ cameras can spot a traffic light changing, they can be confused by strong sunlight. They don’t distinguish between an empty plastic bag - which could be easily driven over - or a rock, so cars must drive around both. They also can’t detect uncovered manholes or potholes. Mr Urmson said: ‘I could construct a construction zone that could befuddle the car.’ This graphic reveals how Google's prototype driverless car looks and works. The car makes turns and reacts to vehicles and pedestrians based on computer programs that predict what others might do, and data from sensors including radar and cameras that read, in real-time, what other objects are actually doing . The prototype two-seater cars have buttons to autonomously begin and end the drive. The car makes turns and reacts to vehicles and pedestrians based on computer programs that predict what others might do, and data from sensors including radar and cameras that read, in real-time, what other objects are actually doing. The route might be set by typing a destination into a map or using spoken commands according to Chris Urmson, the leader of Google's self-driving car team. The car will be powered by electricity and could go about 100 miles (160 km) before charging. Its shape suggests a rounded-out Volkswagen Beetle - something that might move people around a corporate campus or congested downtown - with headlights and sensors arrayed to resemble a friendly face. The front of the vehicle has a soft foam-like material where a traditional bumper would be and a more flexible windscreen, in a bid to be safer for pedestrians. In these prototypes speed is restricted to 25mph (40 km/h) and the ability to self-drive will depend on specifically designed Google road maps tested on the company’s current fleet of vehicles. Ultimately the vehicles will be faster and will be able to use Google's extended maps service. Driving works by using GPS technology to locate the vehicle’s exact position on an electronic map. A combination of radar, lasers and cameras sitting on top of the roof give the car a 360-degree ‘view’, with sensors linked to computer software able to ‘see’ and identify people, cars, road signs and markings and traffic lights. The cars ‘see’ pedestrians as moving blocks of pixels and know to stop, but unlike a cautious human driver, they could not spot a traffic policeman at the side of the road, waving for traffic to stop - which could lead to trouble. Despite the cars being allowed on public roads, they need to prepare to set off in more detail than a human driver, because a precise map must be created of exactly where to go – and a car cannot deviate from its route. An area has to be mapped multiple times by a sensor vehicle to record details such as driveways, in order to make the cars' routes. These details then need to be pored over metre-by metre by humans and computers, in a much more labour-intensive process than in needed to maker Google Maps. One of the features said to be delaying the car's (pictured) release is its inability to cope in heavy rain or snow. An insider recently admitted that the current prototype cars are very reliant on maps to navigate and can’t react like a human driver, dodging potholes and other hazards. They also struggle in poor weather conditions . Despite best efforts, routes can lack details such as temporary traffic lights that have been installed, or if there are road works or potholes to avoid, which the car might drive over. In the US, driverless cars are only allowed on roads in certain states if someone sits in the driver's seat. The California Department of Motor Vehicles is expected to start granting licences to certain driverless cars and their human co-pilots as soon as this month. Changes to the United Nations Convention on Road Traffic, which dates back to 1968, are also afoot. It used to state: 'Every driver shall at all times be able to control his vehicle or to guide his animals.' An amendment agreed in May would allow a car to drive itself, as long as the system 'can be overridden or switched off by the driver'. A driver must be present and able to take the wheel at any time. The convention covers European countries, Mexico, Chile, Brazil and Russia, although not the United States, Japan or China. In addition, maps have only been made for a few thousand miles of road, so in order for the cars to roam the US, Google would need to pour a vast amount of resources into mapping the rest of the vast country, down to the tiniest changing detail. The company is working on ironing out all these problems. For example, if a Google car notes new lights and street signs, it sends a message to update the mapping software. Google unveiled a compact version of its car without a steering wheel, but it will now have to re-introduce the wheel to comply with the California Department of Motor Vehicles’ new regulations. Despite all these set-backs, Mr Urmson said autonomous cars will ‘happen more quickly than people think’ – perhaps as soon as in five years’ time. Last month, Google was awarded 25 of the first 29 permits issued by the state of California to test driverless cars on public roads. Each permit costs $150 for the first vehicle, plus $50 for each additional vehicle, and each one must be insured for up to $5 million. Self-driving cars have been undergoing private tests for at least three years, but government legislation requires permits for them to be used on public roads. The first licence for an autonomous vehicle was issued by Nevada in March 2012 to a Toyota Prius that Google modified to include its driverless technology. Google tests its cars virually (pictured) as well as on real roads. Google’s cars have driven themselves over 700,000 miles (1,126,540km) - but there is still a long way to go to hone the technology . 'My test takes place in a car park at Google’s sprawling Mountain View campus – known as the Googleplex – in the heart of Silicon Valley, California. 'My vehicle is ‘summoned’ via a mobile phone. Google’s vision is that customers will share a driverless car which will be ordered via an app. ‘The car will pick you up, take you where you want to go and then can go off and do errands like pick up your dry-cleaning, freeing you to do other things,’ project director Christ Urmson said. I step inside and sink into soft Hermes orange leather seats. It is surprisingly spacious, uncluttered by the normal ‘car’ things like pedals, a steering wheel and handbrake. 'Instead there are two buttons – green for Go and red for Stop. Caroline Graham, Mail On Sunday LA Correspondent, is shown in Google's driverless car at the tech giant's Mountain View campus during a test drive last month . There is an oblong flatscreen in front of me which shows the time, date, temperature and a computer-generated image of the road ahead. Beneath the high-tech screen is a storage bay for luggage. 'I hit the Go button and take off. The electric engine purrs into life, taking me to a top speed of 25mph (40km/h). 'The car skilfully navigates sharp turns and potential hazards of parked cars and pedestrians who wander in and out of the roadway. 'It ‘senses’ corners and slows down automatically before speeding up into a straight. The sensation is surreal. 'Stationary vehicles and pedestrians show up on the screen as ‘box’ shapes. 'At one point we accelerate down a straight when Mr Urmson suddenly steps out in front of the car… and it automatically slams on the breaks and comes to a controlled halt. 'It’s eerie, impressive and utterly captivating. 'After a few minutes it all starts to feel normal. As the car drives itself I open a computer and answer email. I become oblivious to the outside world. I answer my phone and do some work. I feel perfectly safe. 'Then I hit the Stop button and my journey into the future comes to a gentle halt.'

"The press room, Old Trafford, 2pm, Saturday 28 February 2015. That is where and when the team sheets for Manchester United's match with Sunderland will be handed out. It also when we may find out whether Radamel Falcao has a future at the club. Saturday could be one of Radamel Falcao's final chances to prove himself against Sunderland at Old Trafford . The Manchester United striker has struggled for form since his £6million loan move to the Premier League . The Colombian boasted a fantastic scoring record at Atletico Madrid, scoring 52 goals in 68 appearances . If he has made the starting XI the Colombian has secured another chance. Another chance to show why it would be a good idea for Louis van Gaal to part with £43.2m to secure the services of the 29-year-old permanently. Another chance to reward United fans for their unwavering support. Another chance to show us that the goalscoring machine who was once one of world football's hottest properties is capable of returning to those dizzy heights after his second serious injury. If he is not on the list, then it would appear to be the end of the discussion. Falcao could start for United on Saturday following injuries to Robin van Persie (pictured) and James Wilson . When Van Gaal sits down to pen his line-up for the visit of Gus Poyet's luckless Black Cats he will not be able to select injured duo Robin van Persie and James Wilson. The Dutchman will instead have to decide whether to play Wayne Rooney upfront on his own or whether to give Falcao, with all of four goals under his belt, the nod to start alongside him. His decision will tell us much. If Falcao starts then maybe making that loan move permanent is still under consideration. If he does not, then super agent Jorge Mendes might want to start calling those clubs he claimed would be only too happy to accommodate his man.","Manchester United face luckless Sunderland at Old Trafford on Saturday .
If named in the squad Radamel Falcao will have yet another point to prove .
With just four goals since joining, Falcao's United future is under question .

"Taking a painkiller can numb emotional pain, say experts . Paracetamol could be used to help treat emotional pain and anxiety, according to a new Canadian study. It found that the common painkiller could help alleviate the symptoms of existential dread - the anxiety that arises from uncertainty surrounding the meaning of life and death. The researchers knew from previous . research that both physical and social pain - such as bumping your head . or falling out with friends - can be alleviated with paracetamol. Lead researcher Daniel Randles from the University of British Columbia said: ‘Pain extends beyond tissue damage and hurt feelings, and includes the distress and existential angst we feel when we're uncertain or have just experienced something surreal. 'Regardless of the kind of pain, taking [paracetamol] seems to inhibit the brain signal that says something is wrong.’ He and his colleagues speculated that the uneasiness we feel when faced with thoughts of death might involve similar brain processes. They wondered whether it would it be possible to numb that type of suffering with a simple pain medicine, too. The study involved 120 university students who were divided into two groups.  One group was given a 1000mg pill of Tylenol, an American brand of paracetamol, and the other was given a placebo sugar pill. Some from both groups were asked to write about dental pain while the rest were asked to write about what would happen to them after they died. All participants were then asked to read about the arrest of a prostitute. Participants were asked to set an amount for bail, ranging from nothing to £325, for the hypothetical prostitute. The humble paracetamol was shown to alleviate symptoms of anxiety . As expected, the control group who wrote about dental pain - who felt no existential anxiety - gave relatively low bail amounts of around £195. However, those who wrote about their own death and took no paracetamol, gave the highest amounts, suggesting a fee of around £260. The second part of the study required watching a surrealist video by director David Lynch and then a video of rioters. Researchers found that people who took paracetamol were less judgmental about the behaviour of the rioters. The study demonstrated that existentialist dread is not limited to thinking about death, but can be experienced in any situation which is unpredictable or surprising. 'We’re still taken aback that we’ve found that a drug used primarily to alleviate headaches can also make people numb to the worry of thinking about their deaths, or to the uneasiness of watching a surrealist film,' said Randles. The researchers believe that these studies may have implications for new treatments in the future. 'For people who suffer with chronic anxiety, or are overly sensitive to uncertainty, this work may shed some light on what is happening and how their symptoms could be reduced,' concluded Randles.","Tylenol, an American brand of paracetamol, was found to reduce emotional pain of worry surrounding death .
Experts believe similar therapies could be used to help alleviate symptoms of anxiety in the future ."
"Disgraced celebrity chef Paula Deen has lost millions of dollar after high profile sponsors such as Target and Walmart severed ties with her, but now one company has announced it is sticking with the embattled star. North Carolina-based Universal Furniture International has revealed that it will continue to market the ‘Paula Deen Home Collection’ furniture and home furnishings line. Deen has been under fire since the revelation earlier this year of a legal deposition in which she admitted under oath to having used the N-word. Good news for Paula as finally a sponsor announces that they're sticking with the embattled celebrity chef . North Carolina-based Universal Furniture International has revealed that it will continue to market the ‘Paula Deen Home Collection’ furniture and home furnishings line . Many companies have dropped Deen since the deposition became public including Target, Home Depot and The Food Network, pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk and her book publisher. But on Wednesday Universal Furniture President & CEO Jeff Scheffer announced the company is going to stand by Deen after ‘a very difficult few weeks.’ ‘Obviously, we feel terrible for Paula. The Paula we know – and the one I believe you have gotten to know – is not the same person as the one being portrayed in the media,’ Scheffer said in a letter sent to retailers. ‘Yes, she has acknowledged saying some hurtful things but she has also apologized, and we accept that. We also feel equally dismayed for those hurt by Paula’s remarks, which for certain do not represent our own diverse culture and beliefs at Universal.’ Dora Charles, right, Deen's longtime chef, has accused the celebrity chef of asking black kitchen workers to wear Aunt Jemima-style outfits . In the letter, Scheffer said after careful consideration, ‘we have decided to move forward with the Paula Deen brand and will continue to market her collections as the Paula Deen Home Collection from Universal Furniture.’ Scheffer said over the past few weeks, they heard from many retailers expressing ‘passionate support’ for Deen. ‘Several factors contributed to this decision – our belief that Paula is not the person portrayed by the media, our confidence that the brand will continue to have significant retail value, and most importantly the feedback that we have received from you, our customer,’ Scheffer said. The announcement comes hot on the heels of another employee of Deen coming forward to make accusations about the celebrity chef. Dora Charles, Deen’s longtime chef, has accused Deen of asking black kitchen workers to wear Aunt Jemima-style outfits and claims African American staff were also asked to ring a bell while hollering ‘come and get it’. Charles also alleged that she was paid just $10 an hour and had to endure the TV chef using racist language around her. In a statement to the New York Times, Deen’s spokesman denied asking anybody to dress like Aunt Jemima and denied using racist words in relation to her staff. According to a Deen spokesman: ‘Fundamentally Dora’s complaint is not about race but about money. ‘It is about an employee that despite over 20 years of generosity feels that she still deserves yet even more financial support from Paula Deen.’ The claim is the latest blow to Deen, who is currently scrambling to salvage what is left of her $17m a year empire over the race row. A message for her ex-sponsors: Hardcore Paula Deen fans are sending butter wrappers to the companies that dropped her as a protest . Die-hards Deen fans have taken to . sending empty butter wrappers to her former sponsors as a protest at . what they believe is her unfair treatment after admitting to using . racial slurs. The ‘We Support Paula Deen’ campaign is the brainchild of John Schmitt, a hotel night auditor in Indianapolis. When a host of sponsors severed ties with Deen following her infamous ‘I is what I is’ interview on . the Today show, he decided to do something to show his support for her. ‘In a lot of ways, she reminds me of my mom - this funny, gracious lady from a different era,’ he told CNN. ‘My mom probably used that word and she wasn’t a racist.’ He describes her sponsor's actions as a ‘betrayal’. First he setup the 'We Support Paula Deen' Facebook page, which has attracted over 600,000 likes. Then he and fellow supporters hit upon the idea of sending butter wrappers to her old sponsors as a form of protest - inspired by her favorite cooking ingredient. Butter for Paula: A website has been launched providing fans with addresses for the companies that have severed ties with her . The ‘We Support Paula Deen’ campaign is the brainchild of John Schmitt, right, while another fan, left, posts a photo on the group's website to mourn the closure of the Paula Deen Buffet chain . ‘The butter itself is Paula and these wrappers are void of butter, just like these companies are void of Paula,’ explained supporter Chris Ford. Initially Schmitt wanted to mail actual butter sticks until he realized that would get very messy. Schmitt and his fellow Deen fans don’t expect that the sponsors will take her back as a result of their efforts, but they wanted to do something to express their support for her and what they feel has been a witch hunt against their favorite celebrity chef. ‘I sent a butter wrapper knowing that the chuck-a-lucks down at the Food Network probably wouldn’t even open it,’ wrote Liz Vannah, a supporter from Connecticut, in a Facebook message. ‘But I felt compelled to do something to show that this kind of railroading, for whatever hidden-agenda-ed reason it happened, is not looked kindly upon by the consuming public.’ 'I is what I is': After the controversial Today show interview Deen's sponsors started to leave her in droves . As well as the Facebook page there is also the ‘Butter for Paula’ website which features the slogan – ‘A corporation without Paula Deen is like a butter wrapper without butter’. Joyce Dixon, from Claxton, Georgia, volunteers her time to helping run the campaign and believes Deen has been made a scapegoat. ‘It wasn’t about the N-word; it was about the extortion thing, about this one crazy employee,’ Dixon told CNN. ‘My interest is in Paula’s business. To me, it’s about a self-made woman. You have to ask yourself, “If she was a man, would this happen? If she was from the North would this happen?” And you know, I don’t think it would.’","One of the chef's sponsors has announced that they are sticking by her .

"People who only consume organic products could be suffering from 'chemophobia' and missing out on nutrients found in modern foods . Do you only eat organic food and think microwave meals are 'toxic'? If so, you could be suffering from chemophobia - an 'irrational' fear of chemicals - and missing out on nutrients found in modern food. U.S. researchers have warned that instead of avoiding pesticides and dioxins, people should be more concerned about natural bacteria, fungi and pathogens. They found millions of people are scared of eating unnatural substances, but low doses of natural and synthetic chemicals used in meals pose no risk to people's health. The report, by Dartmouth College in the U.S. which is published in the journal Food Security, argues that low doses of chemicals in modern meals are 'typically harmless and highly beneficial.' It also says that the word 'chemical' has unfairly negative connotations. Study author and chemistry professor Gordon Gribble, said: 'Most people don't know they are routinely exposed to a host of compounds in non-toxic concentrations in what they eat and drink each day. 'Even the air they breathe – whether in big cities or the countryside -- is full of naturally occurring and synthetic chemicals, including wine 'aroma,' flower 'bouquet,' perfume 'fragrance,' bakery 'smell' and the 'stench' of rubbish bins.' However, he said the chemicals are not inhaled in a large enough quantities to affect humans' health. Many of the same compounds found in . pesticides are made naturally by plants, animals and humans 'for their . own defensive purposes,' according to Professor Gribble. The report, by Dartmouth College in the U.S. argues low doses of chemicals in modern meals are 'typically harmless and highly beneficial.' It also says the word 'chemical' has unfairly negative connotations . Professor Gribble cited the example of halogen . compounds, which many people - even many scientists - assume are all . uniquely man-made poisons found in dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls . (PCBs) and the pesticide DDT. But he said thousands of halogen compounds . are part of our natural environment made by plants, . animals and even humans for their own defensive purposes. Some species . even use organohalogens, which contain carbon along with chlorine, . bromine, iodine or fluorine, to mount chemical offensives against . encroaching competitors. While the report says that some beneficial chemicals are found in modern food, it does not suggest swapping fresh vegetables for microwave meals but instead eating a varied diet to avoid exposure to harmful concentrations of chemicals . He said: 'Food regulators should focus not on pesticides, antibiotics and dioxins but on pathogens, bacteria and fungi, which each year cause millions of cases of food-borne infections in the United States that result in hospitalisation or death.' Professor Gribble recommends that people eat  'a diverse diet to minimise their exposure to harmful concentrations of chemicals.' He said food is peppered with natural compounds such as organohalogens, dioxins, aflatoxins and many others. 'Food is chemistry beyond our immediate control, including those synthetic chemicals that are deemed to be artificial and should not be found in 'safe' food. 'The word 'chemical' became a dirty word despite the fact that everything we see, smell and touch is chemical.'","U.S. scientists said some people suffer from an irrational fear of chemicals when low doses used in meals pose no risk to human health .

The WAtoday website reported today that research scientist Dr Rory McAuley found that while the male shark had no visible signs of injury or disease, the large sea lion was found stuck inside its throat. 'This could explain why the shark was exhibiting such unusual behaviour in shallow waters off Coronation Beach,' he said. 'It is possible that the shark was trying to dislodge the blockage. 'Such a large object may have damaged the shark's internal organs or impeded water flow into his gills, contributing to his death.' Dr McAuley said it was also possible that the shark might have become stranded in its attempts to rid itself of the obstruction.' Ms Tash Tapper, who shot footage of the shark while she was on the beach with her family, described the scene as 'surreal'. She told of watching the shark swim in close to the shore, back out and back in for almost two hours. 'Too me, it seemed it was coming in to die,' she told WAtoday.

'Probably lots of teams follow us since 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 when we took the League Cup as a real competition, a real challenge, and we were trying to reach finals and to win. 'For sure, lots of clubs are chasing us. In the semi-final against Liverpool a couple of months ago, we and Liverpool played at the maximum of our potential. We respect every competition.'

"He is the most badly burned survivor of the King's Cross fire after his face melted away and his fingers fused together when he was hit by a 600C fireball. But survivor Kwasi Afari Minta - whose face became the enduring image of the disaster - has said: 'I feel lucky'. The fire on November 18, 1987, killed 31 people and injured more than 60 others. Scroll down for video . The King's Cross fire victim had to wear a medical mask to help skin grafts and treatment of his melted face after he was severely burnt . Bravery behind the mask: Kwasi Afari Minta, who was the most badly burned of the King's Cross survivors, says he feels lucky . Hundreds were trapped underground as black smoke poured through the tunnels as panicking crowds, screaming in terror, hammered on trains which rushed past platforms without stopping. Those that managed to survive from the furnace-like heat and smoke have since spoken of their horror 100ft below ground. Kwasi was one of the survivors, but he has felt the pain ever since. 25-years-ago yesterday, he was on his way home at the end of rush hour and waiting for a tube in the London station when the fire broke out and he became trapped. He was hit in the face just moments away from safety as he tried to escape the inferno, his eyelids melted and his lips were destroyed. His fingers - which, as a musician were his livelihood, were fused together, and became little more than stumps. Still alight and unable to put out the flames, he prayed for a miracle. He survived only after tube passengers tore his burning clothes off as he staggered towards them. Kwasi spent six months in hospital, wearing a mask to keep his skin moist while his face was being rebuilt. He has endured 30 operations in 25 years, procedures that have caused him immense suffering. With his 'claw-like' hands and debilitating pain every time he closes his eyes, he cannot cope with anymore operations. But despite his torment, he still regards himself as 'one of the lucky ones'. He told the Sunday Mirror: 'When I meet people I knew from before the fire, that's when the problems start, if they react badly and sympathise. I don't want tears or sympathy. But I'm still here. I have my son. Most of the time I feel lucky.' Sadly his battle to rebuild his life since the incident has been just as painful. He has relied on benefits ever since after struggling to find work and being shunned because of his face. His first marriage collapsed because his injuries were too severe for his wife to bear. His second wife Regina died in 2003 aged just 45 after an internal hemorrhage. Kwasi was about to walk off the last step of the escalator to safety when he was hit by a huge fireball . The 58-year-old, pictured, had to spend six months in hospital while his face was rebuilt after the horrifying incident at King's Cross station . Kwasi's son Eugene, 20, is severely autistic - a condition he believes was brought on by the trauma of the fire. He cannot speak and has the mental age of a 10-year-old. He added: 'It might have happened 25 years ago but we’re still both living it... even now.' The 58-year-old, a music producer from Ghana who had lived in the UK for two years, was buying records on the day of the fire. He was waiting for a Victoria Line train to his home in Leyton, East London, when the fire broke out, thought to be caused by a discarded match. Tragic: Burnt bodies are loaded onto ambulances outside the station after the fire killed 31 people . People trapped in the underground prayed for a miracle. Many lost their lives . An announcement came over the tannoy from the fire service telling commuters the station could go up in flames at any time. Kwasi was about to walk off the last step at the top of an escalator and was almost safe when he was hit by a huge fireball on the left side of his face. Kwasi, who now lives in Putney, South London, told the Sunday Mirror: 'I started running, trying to escape. But I couldn't. All the exits were blocked. I was trapped. I was still burning but I didn't know how to put out the flames. I just knew that if I fell down I would be dead.' November 1987: Ambulance crews and police gathered at the station but for many it was too late . He was taken to Queen Mary's Hospital in Roehampton, where he spent six months as surgeons rebuilt his face. London Regional Transport admitted liability for the fire and paid out more than £4.5million to victims and their families. But Kwasi - who went to the High Court seeking £780,000 - lost his case and was awarded £150,000. After paying legal fees he ended up with just £28,000. The fire started at about 7.30pm in dry rubbish . under a wooden escalator after a passenger is believed to have thrown . away a cigarette or match. The escalator ran between the Piccadilly line and the mainline station. Kings Cross, London's busiest station, was full of commuters at the tail . end of the rush hour. Many passengers were trapped underground as the escalator went up in flames. Tiles came off walls and concrete was damaged because of the intense heat.

"Back in September, Mr Dromey also favourited a link to a Tweet on a similar theme . Labour frontbencher Jack Dromey was left red-faced after it emerged he added a Twitter link to a gay porn website to his list of ‘favourites’. The shadow policing minister - who is married to Labour deputy leader, Harriet Harman - linked to a tweet about well-endowed black men. The link showed a picture of two men engaged in a sex act. This was the second occasion on which Mr Dromey’s finger had strayed on Twitter. Back in September, Mr Dromey also favourited a link to a Tweet on a similar theme. At the time, the then shadow housing minister dismissed it as a mistake as he and Mrs Harman had been exploring romantic breaks in Paris. According to the Guido Fawkes political gossip website, Mr Dromey said he had accidentally stumbled on the gay porn website - which featured a character called ‘Paris’. Inside Housing covered the story in a diary item, saying: ‘Shadow housing minister Jack Dromey is the latest victim of this murky world after favouriting a tweet that featured a very different type of outstanding member to that normally found in the parliament.’ It is surprisingly easy for Twitter users to publicise embarrassing searches to all their followers by typing key words into the ‘Tweet’ box rather than the search engine. The shadow policing minister - who is married to Labour deputy leader, Harriet Harman - linked to a tweet about well-endowed black men . But the revelation could cause tension with his staunchly feminist wife, Mrs Harman, who has called for the Sun newspaper to stop its ‘sexist’ pictures of topless women on page three. The story was retweeted numerous times after being posted by Guido Fawkes yesterday. A Labour source said: ‘This is a technological mix-up and we’re sure Jack will be taking Twitter lessons to work out the difference between block and favourite as soon as possible.’ The Mail understands that no one else has access to Mr Dromey’s account so the tweet cannot be blamed on a junior staff member. ‘It’s all very embarrassing. He is aware of it. It’s more mix up than conspiracy,’ one insider said. Mr Dromey, a 65 year-old former trade union boss, was elected as the MP for Birmingham Erdington in 2010. His selection was controversial as the usual all-woman shortlist championed by his wife, was bypassed. Meanwhile it also emerged that David Cameron’s official twitter account followed an escort agency. The @Number10gov account was following the @carltonslondon, which described itself as an ‘elite London escort agency’. Downing Street blamed the gaffe on the ‘auto-follow’ facility which has been on the account since Gordon Brown was prime minister. A spokesman said: ‘We have stopped following this particular account. Prior to 2010, an auto-follow process was used, meaning that @Number10gov automatically followed anyone who followed the account. ‘This was common practice at the time for many corporate accounts, but was discontinued in 2009. ‘As a result of this legacy, the @Number10gov account follows almost 370,000 accounts and we have taken steps to un-follow as many as possible that are inactive, spam or inappropriate. ‘This work is ongoing.’ Originally, Twitter users had pointed out that perhaps Mr Cameron had mistaken the escort agency for the Carlton Club, an exclusive private members’ club in London. Official records showed that more than 300,000 attempts were made to access pornographic website in the Houses of Parliament last year. About 5,000 people work on the parliamentary estate.","Labour MP Jack Dromey linked to a tweet about well-endowed black men .

"The creator of a popular style of yoga was recently hit with two lawsuits alleging rape; now there's a third suit against the yogi accusing him of racism, misogyny, sexual harassment, homophobia and threats of violence. Bikram Choudhury, 67, who runs an international 'hot yoga' chain, is being sued by his former legal adviser Minakshi Jaffa-Bodden, who claims in papers filed on June 13 that  he threatened to have her and her eight-year-old daughter deported. Jaffa-Bodden is being represented by Carla Minnard, a civil rights attorney, who says her client was one of the few to stand up to Bikram Choudhury and as a result, was forced by the yogi to resign. Pose: Bikram Choudhury, seen here leading devotees of his Bikram yoga practice, has been accused of a litany of offenses, including rape and sexual harassment . According to Jaffa-Bodden's suit, Choudhury then unlawfully took possession of her company car and evicted her and her daughter from the home the company had provided for her. Finally, Choudhury himself threatened to challenge Jaffa-Bodden's green card application. 'There’s a great desire to keep Bikram’s conduct in the dark,' Minnard told The Huffington Post. 'It shows an inability by anyone to restrain an individual who is a dangerous person.' Jaffa-Bodden was working at Choudhury's LA-based Yoga College of India when she was made aware of allegations of sexual assaults that took place during Choudhury's training conferences. According to the Huffington Post, when Jaffa-Bodden attempted to investigate the alleged assaults, she was told it would be 'best' that she 'not look into it any further'. Hot property: Choudhury claims that Lady Gaga listens to his every word and that presidents Clinton, Nixon and Reagan have sought his expertise . When she ignored this advice, she was subject to intimidation by Choudhury and other employees. Finally, she says, she was forced to sign a letter of resignation in March 2013 under the threat of what she inferred to be physical violence from Bikram Choudhury. Jaffa-Bodden believes it was her vocal objection to Choudhury's behavior that resulted in her forced resignation. She believes this was punishment for her objections to Choudhury’s conduct. Jaffa-Bodden's suit alleges the yoga school's environment was one of rampant misogyny, homophobia, racism, sexual harassment and threats of violence. Choudhury is a self-styled guru who has made millions of dollars out of his yoga movement . 'She did try to stop what she felt was illegal, immoral conduct,' Minnard told The Huffington Post. 'They threatened to have her and her eight-year-old daughter deported.' The suit alleges Choudhury, who has likened himself to Superman and Buddha, was racist, homophobic and mysogynistic. Jaffa-Bodden alleges Choudhury referred to female employees and other women as 'bitches' and was blatantly homophobic. 'AIDS is caused by gays, it is the truth, but these f*****g a**hole guys love me, they love Bikram,' he is reported to have said. The suit also claims that Choudhury treated African-American students differently than others, saying, 'these blacks just don’t get my yoga.' Giving credence to Jaffa-Bodden's claims are two cases brought against Bikram Choudhury alleging rape, sexual harassment and human trafficking in May. According to those suits Choudhury has 'a propensity to sexually assault young women'. The two suits, filed by women named only as Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2 in an LA court, accuse Choudhury and Bikram Yoga College of India of sexual battery, false imprisonment, discrimination, harassment and other counts. Guru: Sarah Baughn was once a Choudhury acolyte but is now suing him for sexual harassment . A third case, brought in March by Sarah Baughn, 29, alleges Choudhury sexually harassed her and then sabotaged her career as a yoga teacher when she turned down his advances. Bikram Choudhury was born in Calcutta, where he began practicing yoga at the age of three. He claims to have taught yoga to presidents Nixon, Reagan and Clinton and has a legion of celebrity fans including Lady Gaga, Madonna, Jennifer Aniston and tennis champion Andy Murray. In his new book, Hell-Bent, about his experiences with Bikram yoga, author Benjamin Lorr described Choudhury as 'an overgrown child and chronic liar with a penchant for emotional abuse.' His style of yoga, known as Bikram, is a series of 26 yoga poses performed . in rooms heated to over 100F.","Yoga mogul Bikram Choudhury is being sued by his former legal adviser .

"Meteorologists working for the Canadian government's weather and meteorological body Environment Canada have been forbidden from publicly discussing climate change. A government spokesperson said this week that the policy exists because its meteorologists aren't qualified to answer questions related to climate change. The policy is part of a government-wide Communications Protocol introduced in August 2006, soon after Prime Minister Stephen Harper's Conservative party came to power. Off limits: Meteorologists with the Canadian government are not permitted to publicly discuss climate change . 'Environment Canada scientists speak to their area of expertise. For example, our Weather Preparedness Meteorologists are experts in their field of severe weather and speak to this subject,' government spokesperson Mark Johnson wrote in an email to journalist Mike De Souza. 'Questions about climate change or long-term trends would be directed to a climatologist or other applicable authority.' Meteorologists are among the most oft-quoted government experts and according to Newsweek, half of all media inquiries received by Environment Canada are for them. However, other federal scientists must seek official permission to speak to journalists and in some cases must have their responses approved by their superiors, as per Harper's Communications Protocol. As a result of the often lengthy process, there has been a huge drop in interview requests for government scientists from major media organizations, which are often working on same-day deadlines. From above: The rule is part of a Communications Protocol introduced by Prime Minister Stephen Harper . According to a leaked Environment Canada document, the agency has noticed that 'Media coverage of climate change science, our most high profile issue, has been reduced by over 80 per cent.' Critics say the government is seeking to 'muzzle' scientists from speaking about climate change. According to a study . by the Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada, many . federal scientists feel they are unable to speak openly in their areas . of expertise.'90 per cent . [of federal scientists] feel they are not allowed to speak freely to . the media about the work they do and that, faced with a departmental . decision that could harm public health, safety or the environment, . nearly as many (86 per cent) would face censure or retaliation for doing . so,' reads the report. 'Federal . scientists are facing a climate of fear,' says PIPSC president Gary . Corbett, 'a chill brought on by government policies that serve no one’s . interests, least of all those of the Canadian public. 'The . safety of our food, air, water, of hundreds of consumer and industrial . products, and our environment depends on the ability of federal . scientists to provide complete, unbiased, timely and accurate . information to Canadians. Current policies must change to ensure these . objectives are met.' Hot debate: Environmentalists are against two tar sands pipelines, which would bring landlocked Alberta's oil to market due to the huge amounts of energy required to extract it. Harper's administration doubled its pro-tar sands advertising budget between 2012 and 2013 . According to Inside Climate News, environmental organizations say they have also come in for undue scrutiny from the government. Seven . organizations were subject to audits by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) this year, just before decisions relating to two tar sands pipelines, . which would bring landlocked Alberta's oil to market, were being made. The . audits are investigating whether the organizations have committed . abuses which would result in them losing their non-profit status, which . exempts them from paying taxes. Canadian law states that no more than 10 per cent of a non-profit's proceeds can be used for political advocacy. If the CRA determines that they have surpassed their advocacy limit, many of the organizations may be forced to shutter. 'It’s all very scary,' Dr Chris Metcalfe, Director of the Institute for Watershed Science at Trent University told Vocativ. 'It’s . all about controlling the message. In my estimation the government . doesn’t want the work of environmentalists running counter to their . official policies.' Harper's administration doubled its pro-tar sands advertising budget between 2012 and 2013, reports Newsweek. Mining the controversial oil uses up a fifth as much energy as it produces and is extremely unpopular with environmentalists.","Meteorologists with the Canadian government aren't allowed to speak publicly about climate change .

"David Cameron could win a parliamentary vote for air strikes on Iraq, it has been claimed . A leading Tory said he believed David Cameron could win a parliamentary vote for air strikes in Iraq, where the US is continuing its offensive against ISIS. Sir Richard Ottaway, chair of the Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee, said there would be support for arming the Kurds – including carrying out air strikes if they request them. Britain has so far contributed technical and humanitarian aid to stricken northern Iraq, but reports in the US suggest Barack Obama will ask the UK and Australia to join the air campaign. Australia has already said it may send war planes if asked. Sir Richard said he believed there would be support for targeting IS in northern Iraq, although Downing Street has said it no formal request had been made and it was not under discussion. He said: ‘As far as Kurdistan is concerned I think there’s a case for arming the Peshmerga, and if they request it, for working with the US on air strikes, although this will need the support of Parliament. ‘My hunch on Iraq is that the view in Parliament has changed and there would be a majority there. Syria is not so straightforward, but I think the situation has changed in Iraq.’ The government suffered an embarrassing Commons defeat last year when 30 Conservative MPs and nine Lib Dems joined Labour in voting against a motion supporting the ‘principle’ of military action against Syria. But Sir Richard said strikes against the jihadists in Iraq would be a ‘legitimate case’. He believed some of those MPs who opposed action in Syria last year would back it. One unnamed minister said this week that the government would not want military action so close to a general election. But Sir Richard said Britain, as a leading member of the EU and Nato and with a permanent seat on the UN security council had a responsibility to help the Kurds if they requested assistance. ‘If we think Kurdistan needs support, and might collapse without our support, then electoral thinking would be immaterial. We have to do what people expect of a country like Britain’, he said. ‘Britain has a longstanding interest in Kurdistan, it was established by John Major after the first Gulf War, it is a well-run country with a proper constitution, and respect for diplomacy, does not have the religious tensions we see elsewhere in the Middle East. It has a very important strategic position. The West should help Kurdistan.’ Any military action must be based on a thorough assessment of how the West can best help them, not a ‘knee jerk’ reaction, he said. Barack Obama this week claimed that an international coalition of willing partners would help root out ISIS once and for all . Mr Obama has authorized surveillance flights over Syria, a move that could pave the way for US airstrikes against ISIS militant targets -- and for international coalition-building at the State Department . The UK is already sending technical support such as night vision goggles and body armour, and transporting ammunition from eastern European countries to the Kurds. The US began targeted air strikes across northern Iraq on August 8. The US President is set to authorise new air raids around the town of Amerli where 12,000 Turkmen people are under siege from IS militants. The administration is also considering targeting IS fighters in northern Syria. But Sir Richard said that in Syria MPs would be unlikely to accept any military action without far more intelligence and a clear exit strategy. Tory MP Richard Ottaway said the PM may get parliamentary approval to attack ISIS . Australia’s defence minister David Johnston said their Super Hornet aircraft were ‘incredibly capable’ and in a ‘high state of readiness’ if action was approved. ‘They’re exactly what flies off US aircraft carriers’, Mr Johnston said. ‘Now, that’s an obvious first port of call were we to consider it necessary to participate with our friends and our ally.’ Prime Minister Tony Abbot told his parliament yesterday that the government had not received an official request to provide military assistance, but was in discussions with the US about it. Mr Abbott described President Obama’s decision to authorise air strikes against the ‘murderous hoard’ of IS as being ‘to his great credit’, but said their involvement would need careful consideration. However John Baron MP, who forced the Commons vote on military action in Syria last summer, in which the government was dramatically defeated, cautioned against air strikes in Iraq. He said the Islamic State fighters must be defeated by local armies – not the West. ‘We have a certain responsibility to the Iraqi people to rid the country of Isis in the north but we must fully explore local options. The West must not be seen as trying to defeat this Caliphate – the symbolism would be very strong. ‘IS is not a disparate group of terrorists living in caves, but a well-organised and equipped guerrilla army which will be difficult to defeat through air strikes alone. The elephant in the room is the Iraqi Army, numbering over 250,000, which should be able to regain all lost territory quickly if properly organised and supported, against only 8,000 IS fighters.’","Foreign Affairs Select Committee chair said PM had support for intervention .

"Suing the force: Robert Carroll, 41, used to work as an undercover drugs purchaser for Greater Manchester Police, but now claims they put him in harm's way . An undercover policeman who slipped into heroin addiction and was jailed for giving police-issue weapons to his dealer is now suing his former force. Robert Carroll, 41, has launched a civil case against Greater Manchester Police (GMP), whom he said encouraged him to inhale heroin smoke, making him 'basically high'. The training exercise was meant to familiarise him with the drug, so he could carry out his role as an undercover purchaser. His work with the force led to convictions for more than 100 dangerous dealers - but he also slipped into addiction himself and lost sight of his police work. Carroll says he feels 'let down' by the police force, and felt unable to ask for help because he was 'surrounded by bravado' at work. He announced his legal case after being released on licence four months into his 14-month sentence for misconduct in public office. Earlier this year Carroll was put in prison after a court heard how his police work and undercover identities became so blurred that we sneaked out of work to meet his dealer in a police car, and gave him weapons in exchange for drugs. The alleged training exercise at which Carroll says he was told to inhale heroin is said to have happened at GMP's Sedgley Park training complex in Prestwich in 2008, some two years after Carroll first started working as an undercover drugs purchaser. He said: 'I felt ill when I walked out of there. They encouraged us to smell the smoke. That was pretty much the start of my downfall. Ultimately, I had a breakdown. 'I’m angry, angry at GMP. Basically they let me down. When I joined they said it was a big family. 'Well, they walked away from a member of that family when he got into big trouble. What sort of family is that? 'I had a mental breakdown and instead of helping me they went after me. My career has been cut short. Some may argue it was my fault and say: ""Why didn’t you get help?"" 'When you are in a position like that and in that kind of job you are surrounded by bravado and everybody else seems to be coping. It’s so hard to seek help when you are not sure what you need help for.' He says he regrets pleading guilty at court, and claims he only did so to protect his wife, also an officer with GMP. The married father-of-four, originally from Ashton-under-Lyne but now living in Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, said he felt more comfortable as Lee Taylor - his ‘smackhead’ alter ego - than his real self. At this point he was smoking heroin every day, whereas before his police career, he claims, he barely drank and never took illegal drugs until he joined the police. He said: 'I was hallucinating. I got to the point where I was more comfortable being my alter ego Lee Taylor than I was being me. 'It was when I was Rob Carroll that I was acting the father, the family man and husband. That’s how bad I got. When you are a smackhead you are so ashamed, it’s the worst thing you can possibly be. Jailed: Carroll, pictured at court earlier this year, was given a 14-month sentence after he admitted meeting his dealer in a police car while he was supposed to be working, and swapping a police-issue weapon for drugs . 'Before I joined the police I had never taken any drugs. I barely drank.' His fall from grace was described as a ‘personal tragedy’ by GMP Chief Constable Sir Peter Fahy. Carroll, now clean, said he had paid for a psychiatrist and a hypnotherapist to oust the Lee Taylor persona from his mind and return himself to the real him. He claims that his problems worsened after his handlers became ‘more reckless’ and asked him to take more risks. 'It started becoming a figures game,' he said, claiming senior officers were more interested in keeping crime figures low than protecting officers’ safety. In the two years before the training exercise, Carroll said he had frequently breathed in heroin smoke while working undercover. He says dealers ordered him to put wraps of heroin he had purchased in his mouth as he left drugs dens in case police officers moved in and he would have to swallow the packages. After being jailed, Carroll said he had to go undercover all over again to save himself from violence from police-hating inmates. He was sent to HMP Wayland in Lincolnshire - the closest prison with no inmates whom he had helped jail. Once inside he pretended to have been jailed for attacking a policeman, rather than admit he used to be an officer himself. He said: 'It was as far as I could get from actually being a police officer. I said I’d been moved from Strangeways because of fighting. 'Part of that was so they would think I was a hard case and they’d leave me alone. I served four months inside but mentally it felt like double that. The only time I could relax was when I was locked up in my cell. 'The rest of the time I was worrying about my story. People in prison want to know about you.' A police spokesman said: 'GMP is aware of legal proceedings brought against the force by former police officer Robert Carroll. 'As these proceedings are ongoing it would not be appropriate to comment further.'","Robert Carroll, 41, used to go undercover as drugs buyer in Manchester .

"Spot the difference: Police have spent more than £50,000 on cardboard cut-outs like this one (right) Police have spent more than £50,000 on cardboard cut-outs of themselves - despite most forces admitting they do not know if they stop crime. The two-dimensional crime fighters are supposed to deter shoplifters and petrol thieves who think they are real PCs from a distance. But some have become victims of crime themselves after being stolen by pranksters or vandalised. Now MailOnline can reveal forces have bought more than 750 of the replicas - at the same time as axing more than 10,000 frontline officers. The total was questioned by the Police Federation, which said more cash should be spent on real PCs. The Taxpayers' Alliance campaign group added: 'This seems to be a gimmick.' Obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, the figures show almost half of Britain's police forces have invested in the cut-outs since 2008, when they first made headlines. A total of 21 forces said £53,940 had been spent on 782 cardboard cut-outs. Most were used for crime prevention along with a small number used as promotional materials. The cost was borne almost entirely by police, with a small amount in some cases contributed by council-led safety partnerships. But there were huge differences in the amount paid by each force - and therefore the value of money to the taxpayer. One police force paid 10 times more for each cardboard policeman than another force 200 miles away. What's all this then? The cardboard PCs are supposed to deter shoplifters - but prove confusing for some . Gwent Police spent by far the most, splashing out £13,260 on just 52 cut-outs at £255 each. By comparison the average cost of a . carboard crime-fighter was a much more modest £69 - and South Yorkshire . Police paid just £25 for each of theirs. Meanwhile, only three of the 21 forces could provide MailOnline with any figures to suggest the cut-outs stop crime. Alongside local figures, South Yorkshire Police cited 'national research' which claimed cut-outs reduced crime by 35 per cent, but this was not quoted by any other force. Nottinghamshire relied on informal feedback which claimed they reduced crime by up to 40 per cent, while Hertfordshire saw shoplifting drop 8.6 per cent 'as part of a wider campaign'. 1. Gwent: £13,260 for 52 cut-outs (£255 each) 2. Derbyshire: £11,280 for 112 (£100 each) 3. South Yorks: £6,000 for 240 (£25 each) 4. Norfolk: £5,330 for 52 cut-outs (£102 each) 5. Humberside: £2,745 for 48 (£57 each) Source: FOI requests by MailOnline . They were not universally loved, however. Earlier this year a man who dragged one of the effigies onto a petrol station forecourt and kicked it to pieces in full view of CCTV was fined £90. Police tracked down the 23-year-old after the bizarre attack at a Tesco petrol station in Pitsea, Essex, after tracing his car numberplate. The incident was embarrassing for Essex Police, which reintroduced the cardboard policemen despite withdrawing a trial of them four years earlier after saying they did not reduce crime. Campaigners have criticised the cost of the effigies, which were bought amid swingeing cuts to police forces. In September 2008, England and Wales . had more than 142,000 officers. Now there are fewer than 132,000, a cut . of 7.4 per cent. Frontline numbers are down by almost 11 per cent since . their peak in September 2009. Falling flat: The cut-outs were scrapped in Essex (pictured) but were then reintroduced - with one being trashed . Responding to the figures, Police Federation Chairman Steve White said: 'Since the 2010 general election, the police service in England and Wales has lost around 16,000 officers and the anticipated reduction in the policing budget in 2015/16 will inevitably lead to a further falls. 2008: £11,735 . 2009: £4,556 . 2010: £4,434 . 2011: £3,865 . 2012: £13,875 . 2013: £7,237 . Year unknown: £8,237,78 . 'This drop in officer numbers is having a negative impact on the service that the police can deliver. We urge forces to ensure they use all the funds at their disposal to keep officer numbers as high as possible.' Andy Silvester, campaign manager for . the Taxpayers' Alliance, added: 'Until it's shown that these actually . work, this seems to be a gimmick that will take money away from . essential front-line services. 'The . public want the thin blue line to be made of police officers, not . cardboard. No cut-out, to my knowledge, has ever slapped handcuffs on a . criminal.' In Gwent Police, the cut-outs were bought from the MWL Print Group in nearby Pontypool between and 2011 and 2013, and were sent into areas with a high shoplifting rate. The high cost was signed off by Detective Superintendent Ian Roberts and his successor DCI Richard Williams insisted the force had sought multiple quotes - but 'the chosen supplier produced a far more robust model being mounted on wood which is still in use'. He added: 'We have had considerable success in dealing with shoplifting since the cut outs were introduced. On the beat: Police Federation chairman Steve White said funds should be focused on frontline officers . 'We have them deployed at larger stores, and garages throughout the force area. Levels of shoplifting continue to fall in Gwent. The trend began in October 2011 and, compared to our most similar Forces, Gwent experienced the second lowest level of shoplifting per 1000 residents in the past 12 months and we remain committed to using every technique available to prevent this crime. 'The replicas, which have also been introduced into other Force areas, are by no means a replacement for real police officers. They are simply another tool in the fight against crime. 'The replicas will remind potential thieves that real police officers are regularly in and around the shops as part of their normal patrols, and the initiative is another way for police and partners to work together.' The Association of Chief Police Officers said it was up to individual forces to decide what they buy. National policing lead for procurement Lee Tribe said: 'There are no national guidelines for the procurement of ""cut-outs"" of officers. This is a matter for each force and will be budgeted for on a force-by-force basis. 'Their use will be determined locally which may include such activities as publicity and recruitment.'","Almost half of Britain's forces have invested in the replicas since 2008 .

"On Wednesday it was the typically press shy Huma Abedin who made the headlines instead of her husband, disgraced former Congressman Anthony Weiner. First, she and Weiner appeared in a People magazine spread where she declared that she is proud to be married to her husband even after the Twitter sexting scandal that forced him to resign his position as a Democratic representative for part of the Queens borough in New York. Then she was a hot topic among Republican politicians, with some- like Michele Bachmann- deriding her with claims  that her family has connections to Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood, and others- like John McCain- coming to her defense. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Calling her out: Though John McCain (right) never mentioned her explicitly, he gave a seven-minute speech slamming a letter that Michele Bachmann (left) wrote deriding one of Hillary Clinton's top aides . Former presidential candidate Senator McCain spoke passionately about Ms Abedin’s years of dedicated public service in her role as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s top advisor, and denounced the senseless character attacks that were made by some of his more conservative party members. Trusted: Bachmann says Ms Abedin's position is highly sensitive and she could abuse it, effectively because of falsified rumors about her Muslim family's connections . 'Huma represents what is best about America: the daughter of immigrants, who has risen to the highest levels of our government on the basis of her substantial personal merit and her abiding commitment to the American ideals that she embodies so fully.' McCain said in his speech on the Senate floor. 'I am proud to know Huma, and to call her my friend.' Bachmann, who rose to national prominence during her failed bid for position of this year’s Republican presidential candidate, alleged that Ms Abedin’s deceased father, mother, and brother are connected to the Muslim Brotherhood, the controversial political opposition group who often works against American interest in Arab states. Touting her role on the House Intelligence Committee, Representative Bachmann wrote a letter- which was co-signed by four other congressmen- alleging that given Ms Abedin’s highly-sensitive position in Ms Clinton’s staff, she is effectively a national security threat due to her fictitious connections to the Brotherhood. In the letter, which was sent to the deputy inspector general of the State Department and the Director of National Intelligence among others, Mrs Bachmann and her co-signers gave no traces of evidence of their findings. Mr McCain made a clear attack on the statements, drawing on his own personal experience having been the victim of false rumors during his multiple presidential campaigns, and having his heroism questioned in spite of his strong military record which included many years as a prisoner during the Vietnam War. Stay at home dad: Weiner has been taking care of his new son Jordan while his wife Huma Abedin continues her high-powered job at Hillary Clinton's top aide . Well connected: Ms Abedin has stood quietly by her husband Anthony Weiner in the wake of his sexting scandal last year that lead to his resignation . He said that he knows the pain that is cause 'when a person's character, reputation and patriotism are attacked.' 'When anyone, not least a member of Congress, launches specious and degrading attacks against fellow Americans on the basis of nothing more than fear of who they are and ignorance of what they stand for, it defames the spirit of our nation, and we all grow poorer because of it,' he said. ‘To say that the accusations made in both documents are not substantiated by the evidence they offer is to be overly polite and diplomatic about it. ‘The letter in the report offer not one instance of an action, a decision or a public position that Huma has taken while at the State Department or as a member of then-Senator Clinton's staff that would lend credence to the charge that she is promoting anti-American activities within our government.’ In the shadows: A then-pregnant Abedin (left in both shots) was the one to hand Clinton her Blackberry when the news came through that Muammar Gaddafi had been killed . Defender: John McCain dismissed the letter about Abedin as reckless and said that he was honored to call her a friend . Mrs Clinton’s staff clearly appreciated the bi-lateral support that he showed in renouncing the move. Mrs Clinton’s spokesman Philippe Reines dismissed the accusations, calling them 'nothing but vicious and disgusting lies, and anyone who traffics in them should be ashamed of themselves. I would hope that hearing the remarkable statement from someone of Senator McCain's stature gives her (Bachmann) pause in doing so any further.' In response, Mrs Bachmann said that her words were being twisted and that the point of her letters was 'to outline the serious national security concerns I had and ask for answers to questions regarding the Muslim Brotherhood and other radical group's access to top Obama administration officials.'

"'The girl was predatory': Judge Nigel Peters, who allowed a paedophile to walk free after he admitted abusing a girl of just 13 years old . A judge allowed a paedophile to walk free after his 13-year-old victim was described as a 'sexual predator' who was 'egging him on' to engage in a sexual act. Judge Nigel Peters told Neil Wilson, 41, who pleaded guilty to the abuse, he had also taken account the fact the child looked older. Wilson lured the teenager to his home in Romford, Essex, where he watched her strip out of her school uniform before she performed a sex act on him. The abuse did not come to light until the girl confided in a friend who then told police. During a search of Wilson’s home officers also uncovered a stash of images and videos depicting child abuse and bestiality. He admitted a string of charges but was handed a suspended sentence at Snaresbrook Crown Court. Judge Peters told him: ‘You have come as close to prison as is imaginable. ‘I have taken in to account that even though the girl was 13, the prosecution say she looked and behaved a little bit older. ‘You knew she was not nearly 16 as she said and your plea of guilty recognises that you knew. ‘Allowing her to visit your home is something we have to clamp down on and in normal circumstances that would mean a significant term in prison. ‘On these facts, the girl was predatory and was egging you on. ‘That is no defence when dealing with children but I am prepared to impose a suspension.’ Wilson was handed an eight-month jail term, suspended for two years, and will also be supervised by the Probation Service for the next three years. He has been banned from contacting children and must allow police to examine his computer, as well as attending a sex offenders’ programme. Wilson met the schoolgirl when she asked him to buy cigarettes for her while she was playing truant. He enjoyed a two-week ‘fling’ with his victim, during which he bombarded her with phone calls and text messages and she continued to visit his home, the court heard. Guilty: Neil Wilson admitted at Snaresbrook Crown Court that he lured the teenager to his home in Romford, Essex, where he watched her strip out of her school uniform before she performed a sex act on him . Prosecutor Robert Colover, told the judge: ‘The girl is predatory in all her actions and she is sexually experienced. ‘She appeared to look around 14 or 15 and had the mental age of a 14 or 15 year old despite being younger than that. ‘There was sexual activity but it was not of Mr Wilson’s doing, you might say it was forced upon him despite being older and stronger than her. ‘As for the images, there were eight found of child pornography, four of which fall in to the category three. ‘There were also 11 images involving horses and dogs found on his computer.’ Wilson, now of York, pleaded guilty to two counts of making extreme pornographic images and one count of sexual activity with a child.","Neil Wilson lured the girl to his home where she performed a sex act on him .

"Thousands of people including women and children are being held illegally and tortured by rebels who helped oust Colonel Gaddafi, according to a UN report. Around 7,000, many of them foreigners, are behind bars in private prisons and makeshift detention centres, beyond the control of the new Libyan government and without access to any legal redress. The report by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon will be embarrassing for Britain and other governments which supported the overthrow of the Gaddafi regime despite concerns about who would take power in their place. Racism? Rebel fighters hold captive a sub-Saharan African man . Many of the detainees are sub-Saharan Africans whom their captors accuse of being Gaddafi mercenaries, based in some cases purely on the fact that they have darker skin. The women and children are being held with them, under the control of male-only guards. ‘Some detainees have reportedly been subjected to torture or ill treatment,’ the UN said. While political prisoners jailed by Gaddafi have been freed, the militias’ prisoners have no access to the courts ‘in the absence of a functioning police and judiciary’, it added. Most policemen have failed to return to work in the lawlessness that grips Libya while the court system has been paralysed by a lack of security and absenteeism by judges and administrative staff. Out of control: Rebel fighters question another sub-Saharan as they search for Gaddafi army soldiers in Tripoli in August . While the new government tries to assert control over the chaos, UN officials and foreign diplomats warn that the ‘revolutionary brigades’ that united to drive out Gaddafi’s forces are largely tribal and have kept significant control in their own regions. The report also said there were ‘disturbing’ claims of war crimes being committed by both sides as they fought for control of Sirte, the town where Gaddafi was captured and killed last month. As an example of the atrocities committed by the rebels, the report highlighted the town of Tawerga, whose inhabitants have been accused of siding with Gaddafi during the civil war. The UN said Tawergas are ‘reported to have been targeted in revenge killings, or taken by armed men from their homes, checkpoints and hospitals and some allegedly later abused or executed in detention’. The UN also warned that a vast arsenal of surface-to-air missiles, known as Manpads, had been accumulated in Libya, further worsening the security situation there.","UN raises concerns of torture and ill-treatment .

"European migrants living in Scotland, including thousands of Germans, could hold the key to breaking up Britain. Polls suggest the referendum on Scottish independence is on a knife-edge – meaning the views of many of the 120,000 non-Scots EU citizens who live north of the border could play a pivotal role. Poles are the biggest group of foreigners on the electoral roll, and there are about 13,000 German citizens eligible to vote. Scroll down for video . Coming out for independence: German nationals Daniel Mittler (left) and Stefan Buettner, who live in Scotland . Experts believe many of them may choose to back Scottish independence because of Westminster’s perceived hostility to the European Union. Among the Germans backing the ‘Yes’ campaign is Bavarian Stefan Buettner, who lives in Edinburgh. Mr Buettner, an energy adviser, said: ‘I feel Scotland is more pro-European than the rest of the UK. ‘I want the Yes side to win. The Germans and the Scots are very much compatible and there are a lot of cultural similarities. ‘We are equally tight with money, we love a bargain and share a similarly dry sense of humour.’ Left-leaning German-Scot Daniel Mittler feels a vote for independence would help to shift the political direction of Europe. The Edinburgh university graduate and environmental activist said: ‘I say “Ja” to an independent Scotland, to chart a different course than the suicidal, City-dependent and fossil-fuelled trajectory that the London-dominated UK is on. Latest census figures show 120,824 EU citizens (excluding English, Welsh, Irish and Northern Irish) are eligible to vote in the referendum on the grounds that they currently live in Scotland and are aged 16 or over. The Electoral Commission said in December that 80,000 of those who were eligible had actually registered to vote. On this basis it is estimated that there are: . (Plus smaller groups from 19 other EU countries) ‘Scottish self-rule has the potential to be a building block for a Europe of the regions.’ Fear of a Conservative and Ukip coalition has led St Andrews-based massage therapist Camilla Hey, who grew up near Dusseldorf, to change her view on Scotland’s future. She said: ‘The idea of a Conservative and Ukip coalition freaks me out. The Scottish are very clear that they want to stay in the EU and so do I. If we vote No and remain tied to England, and then vote to quit the EU, we will go back to Germany.’ Edinburgh-based linguistic researcher Margarete Tan remains undecided, but acknowledges she sees a number of advantages in creating a new Scottish state. The Bavaria-born mother of three said: ‘I do, very much, see arguments in favour of Scottish independence. Creating a new country from scratch gives you the opportunity to establish proportional representation in the electoral system.’ Professor Sir Tom Devine, the eminent Scottish political historian who is in favour of independence, said: ‘EU migrants could absolutely have an impact on the vote. They could be the X-factor in the decision.’ Dr Diego Palacios Cerezales, a politics lecturer at Stirling University, said: ‘The question of whether to vote Yes or No is being decided on many different levels for European citizens. ‘They see that Scotland is more pro-European than the rest of the country. There is the chance of a referendum as early as next year on Britain’s membership of the EU, which could see the UK leave. Global city: A view of Edinburgh from Calton Hill. More than 120,000 citizens from elsewhere in the EU can vote . ‘That may turn many towards the Yes camp in this vote.’ The organisation Germans For Scottish Independence has more than 1,000 followers on Facebook. Supporter Vince Diaz stated: ‘We are terrified that lot downstairs [will] take Scotland out of Europe if No wins. We’d have to leave or beg for a foreign subject permanent visa. Independence is the only solution.’ Ania Lewandowska, of the group Polish For Yes, said: ‘We are worried about Westminster’s increasingly Right-wing agenda and the rise of Ukip.’ However, last month, a survey of 245 Scots-based Poles suggested that two thirds were intending to vote No. Andrew Kocaj, 27, managing director of the Polish Family Support Centre in Edinburgh said: ‘I’m quite happy with the way things are.’ German-born Dr Anselm Heinrich, a lecturer in theatre studies at Glasgow University, moved to Scotland in 2006. He said: ‘I have already voted No by post. While I love the spirit of “we’re going to make this happen” I think it’s based on a very romantic notion which, in practice, is not feasible.’ Council employee Ildiko Mair, from Aberdeen, moved from Hungary 23 years ago. She said: ‘The Hungarian community here all want the same – that is to say no thanks. ‘I have no idea why someone wakes up one morning and after 300 years of unity decides to try and fix what is not broken.’","120,000 EU citizens who live in Scotland can vote on future of the Union .

"Washington Redskins running back Alfred Morris' pride and joy isn't a sports car, a Hummer or a Cadillac - it's a 1991 Mazda 626, which until recently had no air-con and a large dent in the back right panel. The NFL star certainly makes enough money to afford a brand-new car, but Morris has no interest in other vehicles. 'I didn’t grow up with a lot. This helps me remember where I come from and where I’m going,' he says. The Bentley: Morris' beloved 1991 Mazda 626 is back to her best after a refurb . First love: Morris says he doesn't see why he should buy a new car when his old one is still running . Since Alfred Morris is an NFL player . on an NFL salary, the question must be asked: why the attachment to a . small sedan that's more than 20 years old? Morris purchased the car from his pastor while he was a student at Florida State University for the sum of $2. And while he could be getting around in something a little more lavish, Morris only has eyes for his first love. 'It’s more than just a car,' Morris, who started as a rookie with the Washington, DC, team last year, told Jalopnik. Refreshingly, Morris doesn't have any desire to acquire status symbols, despite his success on-field. 'I'm loyal to my car,' he said, explaining that he doesn't feel the need . to show off his money with expensive cars and clothing. 'I love my car, and that's what I'm . going to drive. I'm a lot better off than I was but at the same time... I . feel like it's a waste of money to go buy a new car if my car is . running perfectly fine, you know? I just don't get that concept,' he . told WUSA-TV. Good as new: Morris will now enjoy air-conditioning in his Mazda 626 . Pro: Morris is running back for the Washington Redskins . The car, which Morris refers to as . 'the Bentley,' recently underwent a complete overhaul to keep it up and . running for another 20 years. After hearing about Morris' love for his car, Mazda offered to refurbish the Bentley, . which had broken air-conditioning and was in need of some TLC. Morris was separated from his car as it underwent a total of 275 man hours of labor and received more that 450 new parts. Mazda sent him regular updates on the progress, although sometimes he found it all a little much. 'I was like, ""Oh, wow.’ I didn’t know they were gonna go that deep,' Morris told the Washington Post. 'It was weird seeing her like that. I was like, ""No! They took her apart!"" It hurt, just a little bit.' At the big reveal on Tuesday at the Chantilly Mazda dealership, Morris was eager to see how his trusty car scrubbed up. 'She hasn’t changed,' he told the Washington Post. 'I . mean, she looks different, but it’s still the same car. It a feel . thing. Sometimes when something changes, you’re like, ""Oh man, I want it . the old way."" But when I sat in her, I still got that feeling. She’s . still the Bentley.' Loyal: Morris has been driving the car since his college days when he bought it from his pastor for $2 . The Bentley looked as good as when she was first driven off the lot in 1991. On the outside, the car had been completely repainted and new headlights and taillights were installed. According to Jalopnik, the car received new 626 emblems and Mazda created some new exterior trim pieces using the original molds in Japan. A dent on the back right side was panel-beaten out, despite some misgiving from Morris. 'The character, the dent that was in the back right side. I had the option to keep it, but then I called them and was like, ""Don’t worry about it."" All the hard work that they put into it, I think it would have took away from it if it still had the dent in the side. So I was like, I won’t be selfish. I’ll just keep the memory in my mind and said they could take it out.' Mazda man: With help from the Mazda team, Morris and his ride have many more years together to look forward to . Mazda technicians removed the powertrain, rebuilt the 2.2-liter, 110 horsepower four-cylinder engine, installed new hoses, gaskets and rubber items, put in a new air conditioner, added new brakes front and rear, put on a new exhaust system, and even replaced the battery and alternator. 'It’s old school, like I am,' Morris said at the reveal, according to Jalopnik. 'I know I haven’t been around long, but I have an old spirit.' There are a few new-school features that Mazda has added to the new and improved Bentley, including Bentley-style cross-stitched leather seats in homage to the car's namesake, and a new dashboard and a seven-inch touchscreen Pioneer stereo with Bluetooth. 'Man, I got my baby back, and she looks better than ever,' Morris said Tuesday. 'I just want to ride around and go nowhere in her. I’ll bet she’s been missing it.'","Alfred Morris, running back for the Washington Redskins, bought the  1991 Mazda 626 for $2 .

"A New Hampshire Marine who was barred from wearing his uniform for his high school graduation last June has been killed by a roadside bomb. Lance Corporal Brandon Garabrant, who signed up for the forces immediately after finishing his studies, was one of three U.S. service members killed in Afghanistan on Friday morning. The community where the 19-year-old grew up were saddened by his death, and a flag was at half mast outside the fire station he volunteered at. Proud to serve: Lance Corporal Brandon Garabrant, a 19-year-old Marine, was killed by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan on Friday . Garabrant had been so proud of making it into the Marines that he made headlines last year after trying to wear his uniform to his high school graduation. His Peterborough school denied his request, telling the teenager that he would have to wear his cap and gown over the newly acquired uniform. The principal, Brian Pickering, this week praised his former student and said the school community was upset to hear that Garabrant had died. 'We are all shocked and deeply saddened by his passing and we are incredibly grateful for his service to our country,' Pickering told WMUR9. Garabrant's untimely death struck a chord with many in his New Hampshire community. Several had already backed the young man's dedication to the forces after his plea to graduate in his uniform. Hero: As well as serving in the Marines, Garabrant worked as a volunteer firefighter . Protect: U.S. troops secure an area near the Pakistan-Afghan border on Thursday after a different attack on Nato supply trucks. Garabrant had been serving as part of a Nato force in a different part of the country . At the time of the high school celebration last June, he had just completed his training at a South Carolina camp. Several shops around the school showed their support for his request to wear the uniform, and put signs up calling for the school to change its rules. His mother, Jesse Garabrant, said at the time: 'I'm overwhelmed with the support of the community. It's just wonderful.'

He had also made light of the extreme weather conditions he and the fellow Marines were working in, as he posted a picture of the forecast this week, showing it reaching 113F. New Hampshire governor Maggie Hassan has paid tribute to the Marine and volunteer firefighter who was 'dedicated to serving his fellow citizens, and he was tragically taken from us far too soon'. Senator Jeanne Shaheen added: 'Garabrant was a hero in every sense of the word.

"Waiting to hear: 57,000 people are currently on police bail in Britain, including one man 42 months later . Thousands of criminal suspects are ‘left dangling’ on police bail for months before they are told if they will be charged. More than 57,000 people are on this type of bail – where conditions are set by the police rather than the courts – including 3,000 for more than six months. One fraud suspect is still on bail three years and seven months after being arrested, a survey found. Many of those arrested and bailed will ultimately not face charges. In some cases, suspects are suspended from their jobs while allegations against them are investigated. The Law Society, which represents solicitors, is calling for a 28-day limit on police bail, after which it said officers should be required to go before a magistrate to justify further bailing of a suspect. Freedom of Information requests by BBC Radio 5 Live found at least 57,428 suspects were on bail in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, while 3,172 have been on bail for more than six months. In Scotland, bail is set by the courts, not the police. Scotland Yard has more than 12,000 suspects on bail, including 910 for over six months. In London, a man, 45, has still not been told if he will be charged after he was arrested in October 2009 on suspicion of fraud. Senior police officers appear divided on the issue, with Andy Trotter, the head of the British Transport Police, calling for a six-month limit on bail. However, the Association of Chief Police Officers said that bail was an ‘essential tool in securing justice’. Richard Atkinson, chairman of the Law Society’s criminal law committee, said: ‘It is not unusual for people to be on bail for several months while fairly routine investigations meander their way to a final decision. ‘Because there is no requirement for . the police to act within any time, there is an attitude among some . officers of “let’s put off until tomorrow what we could have done today” and things are just left to drag along.’ He said one suspect accused of . stealing a bicycle had been left on bail for seven months. The largest number of bailed individuals are in London, with 12,178 waiting to hear from the Metropolitan Police . Civil liberties campaigners have . condemned the excessive use of police bail, which allows officers to . restrict suspects’ activities. This can include forcing them to live at a . certain address, handing over their passport and making them report to a . police station on a regular basis. There is no time limit on how long bail can continue and how many times it can be renewed. Earlier this month, Mr Trotter told . The Mail on Sunday: ‘In the past, police have released people without . bail and that hasn’t stopped us continuing the investigation, . particularly if they are unlikely to abscond. We have re-arrested them . at a later stage when we have had sufficient evidence. That way, they . are not left dangling.’ But Chris Eyre, Acpo spokesman and . chief constable of Nottinghamshire, said: ‘Police bail  is an essential . tool in securing justice. It allows investigators to ensure every . possible avenue is explored, while those arrested need not remain in . custody.’ Steve White, vice-chairman of the . Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, said the . lack of resources made it more difficult for investigations to be . concluded quickly. A Home Office spokesman said: ‘We . continue to keep police bail provisions under review to ensure they . strike the right balance between protecting an individual’s right to . civil liberty and allowing police to carry out thorough criminal . investigations.’","Experts call for 28-day limit on bail period in light of new figures .

"A surge in applications from migrants is fuelling the Passport Office crisis, it emerged last night. A record 207,989 foreigners were handed citizenship last year – a huge rise on the 82,000 seen in the year 2000. Their requests for papers are contributing to the delays at the Passport Office, which is struggling to clear a backlog of 500,000 applications. Scroll down for video . A record 207,989 foreigners were handed citizenship last year - a huge rise on the 82,000 seen in the year 2000 . The holiday plans of thousands of families are being wrecked by the failure of their passports to arrive on time. Last year only 3 per cent of those who asked for citizenship were rejected and two million migrants have been awarded it since 2000. Once citizenship is granted, a first passport application usually follows – a time-consuming bureaucratic exercise that involves a face-to-face interview. Whistleblowers say these first-time applicants are being pushed to the back of the queue as Passport Office staff try to get to grip on the crisis. Alp Mehmet, of Migration Watch, said: ‘The moment you become a British citizen you can get a British passport and I suspect many of those 207,000 will have and that is certainly something that adds to the difficulties.’ Adults who had booked face-to-face interviews in London were directed to offices elsewhere to allow staff to concentrate on fast-track renewals. The Home Office claimed this measure was ‘nothing out of the ordinary’ but applicants described chaotic scenes inside the offices with some people in tears. Claire McKay spent two days frantically trying to obtain a passport for her teenage daughter to go on holiday. ‘It is very traumatic, I have been crying a lot,’ said the social worker. ‘I was very upset, but it was the only way they would understand.’ The holiday plans of thousands of families are in jeopardy as the Passport Office struggles to clear a backlog of 500,000 applications . Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said: ‘This shambles just gets worse. Londoners are due to have their passport office part shut in their faces just at the time they need it most. ‘Home Secretary Theresa May has refused to say sorry for her shambles. She needs to get a grip, take responsibility and put this right.’ Under new measures, Britons who are due to travel in the next seven days, and who submitted their application longer than three weeks ago, will be granted a fast-track passport service free. Expats seeking to renew their passport overseas so they can get back to the UK will gain an automatic 12-month extension and parents living overseas applying for their children will be given emergency travel documents. One insider said some of his colleagues were becoming suicidal under the pressure of trying to clear the backlog. ‘Theresa May has got no idea. She doesn’t know how bad things are,’ he added. ‘We are just worn out, really worn out, and it’s been going on for far too long. A woman in my team burst into tears because of the pressure.’ Tens . of thousands of applications wait to be processed at the Liverpool . passport office, one of seven around the country. This photo was taken . by an employee who said staff were being drafted in from other departments . The disillusioned employee works at the Liverpool passport office where a member of staff this week leaked a photograph of thousands of applications stacked in meeting rooms waiting to be processed. He said staff were being drafted in from other departments without adequate training. Critics have blamed job cuts and office closures for the problems. In the face of mounting fury, Mrs May and other ministers had refused to acknowledge there was a crisis, attributing an ‘unprecedented’ surge in applications to a stronger economy. In the final three months of last year, 59,687 citizenship applications were approved compared with 41,121 in the same period of 2011. This is the group of people most likely to be seeking their first British passport.","Record number of 207,989 foreigners handed British citizenship last year .

"Fired: Craig James, a former NFL tailback who played with the New England Patriots in the 1980s, made the remarks in a debate in Texas during his failed run at the Senate in 2012 . Footage of a Fox Sports presenter making a homophobic comment has led to his dismissal. Craig James, a former NFL who played with the New England Patriots in the 1980s, said during a debate that gay people would 'have to answer to the lord for their actions'. He made the remarks in a debate in Texas during his failed run at the Senate in 2012. The 52-year-old former ESPN sportscaster, who was only hired by rival Fox a month ago, told the debate that being gay 'is a choice' and that people who 'choose to do that' will 'have to answer to the Lord for their actions'. The comments, which drew hearty . applause from the audience, left Fox bosses with little choice but to . cancel his contract 'with immediate effect'. 'Craig . James will not be making any further appearances on Fox Sports . Southwest's football coverage this season,' a Fox Sports spokesperson . told Sports Illustrated. Another Fox spokesman told the Dallas Morning News: . 'We just asked ourselves how Craig’s statements would play in our human . resources department. He couldn’t say those things here.' James . stepped down from his role as sports presenter on ESPN to run for the . Senate as a Republican in 2012. He made the comments during a debate in . April 2012 that was televised across Texas. 'People choose to be gay... I think . its a choice, I do.' he said. 'Same sex marriage, if someone chooses to . do that, that's done. And God's going to judge each one of us in this . room for our actions. 'And in that case right there, they're going to have to answer to the Lord for their actions.'

Homophobic: The 52-year-old former ESPN sportscaster, who was only hired by rival Fox a month ago, told the debate that being gay 'is a choice' and that people who 'choose to do that' will 'have to answer to the Lord for their actions' 'I'll tell you what, we have a fiscal issue in this country... we also have a moral issue in this country.' Hiring James a month ago, FSSW executive producer Mike Anastassiou said: 'We’re excited to add Craig to the FOX Sports Southwest team. 'He’s a talented broadcaster who I’ve admired throughout his career. His knowledge of college football and the experience he brings as an analyst will be a tremendous asset to our coverage.' James is a polarising figure who was embroiled in Texas Tech University's 2009 decision to fire popular football coach Mike Leach over allegations the coach mistreated Mr James's son, a Red Raiders player, after he sustained a concussion. He was also a member of the record-setting SMU football team in the early 1980s when the program entered a series of scandals that ultimately forced the NCAA to shut it down. Former player: James carries the football on a two-yard touchdown run for the New England Patriots in a 1986 AFC Divisional Playoff Game . He later played for the New England patriots between 1984 and 1988. From 1979 to 1982, Mr James was a star player at SMU and was part of the record-setting 'Pony Express' backfield with Eric Dickerson. Though the Mustangs won Southwest Conference championships in 1981 and 1982, the team was also embroiled in several NCAA investigations. In 1987, the NCAA hit SMU with the so-called 'death penalty' for repeated infractions, shutting down the program for a year after finding SMU had continued to pay players after promising in 1985 it would stop. SMU also chose not to play in 1988 because the NCAA would have limited the Mustangs to only seven games, none at home. The scandal is generally considered among the worst in college sports history. The sanctions levelled by the NCAA decimated the Mustangs program and SMU remains the only school to be given the 'death penalty'. Mr James was never directly implicated in the NCAA transgressions and he has consistently denied any involvement.","Craig James, 51, played tailback for the New England Patriots in the 1980s .

"Rupert Murdoch was banned from the star-studded birthday party of his public relations mogul son-in-law Matthew Freud in a tit-for-tat family conflict linked to Tony Blair’s relationship with Mr Murdoch’s ex-wife Wendi Deng. And last night Mr Murdoch and Mr Freud were embroiled in a public war of words as the repercussions of the Blair-Deng controversy spread. The latest development came after The Mail on Sunday learned that Mr Freud, married to Mr Murdoch’s daughter Elisabeth, axed his father-in-law from the guest list for his 50th birthday party last month. It was the latest, dramatic sign of Mr Freud’s support for Mr Blair in the former Prime Minister’s own dispute with Mr Murdoch, who divorced Ms Deng three months ago. The way they were: The now fragmented and warring Murdoch-Freud alliance pose for a family snap back in 2008 . The Freud party snub came after Mr Murdoch had Mr Blair barred from attending a media summit in the US after finding a note suggesting Ms Deng had a ‘crush’ on him and discovering the pair had spent weekends at Mr Murdoch’s homes without his knowledge. Mr Blair and wife Cherie were star guests at Mr Freud’s celebrity-studded party at his Oxfordshire mansion, with his father-in-law conspicuously absent. A long-standing friend of Mr Murdoch said Mr Freud’s move was  ‘a very public V-sign to Rupert’. And in a surprise move, both men intervened publicly last night, in a courteous but loaded exchange.Mr Freud confirmed he had fallen out with Mr Murdoch, saying their views ‘differed dramatically’ on several issues, causing ‘conflict’ between them. They both loved Elisabeth, Mr Freud’s wife and Mr Murdoch’s daughter, he said, adding pointedly ‘if not always each other’. Close friends: Matthew Freud with Tony Blair . And Mr Freud bluntly challenged the claim that Mr Murdoch was upset to be excluded from the party, saying: ‘He has said nothing to me personally.’ But a source close to Mr Murdoch hit back, saying: ‘Matthew and Rupert have no relationship and so none of this is a surprise.’ Other sources close to Mr Murdoch last night accused Mr Freud of cultivating Mr Murdoch’s ex-wife Wendi to antagonise him. And they say the Murdoch-Freud battle has affected Mr Murdoch’s relationship with daughter Elizabeth. The family infighting comes after The Mail on Sunday revealed the link between Mr Blair’s relationship with Ms Deng and the Murdochs’ marriage breakdown – and how it caused a ‘terminal’ rift in relations between Mr Murdoch and Mr Blair. Mr Blair denies he had an affair with Ms Deng. A source at Mr Murdoch’s News International company in the UK said: ‘Rupert is particularly upset that Matthew and Elisabeth held a party at exactly the time when rumours were circulating about Wendi and Blair. Rupert wasn’t invited but Blair was. That was a very public V-sign to Rupert. ‘Freud has been sending crazy 3am emails to Rupert making all sorts of accusations. Elisabeth is stuck in the middle and it has had a devastating effect on her relations with Rupert.’ Mr Murdoch’s supporters claim Mr Freud ‘joined forces’ with Ms Deng in his own battle with Mr Murdoch. ‘He set out to cultivate her as an ally, saying all sorts of negative stuff to her about Rupert,’ a friend said. In addition, the Murdoch camp accuse Mr Freud of orchestrating  a ‘briefing war’ against him after Mr Murdoch’s fury with Mr Blair was revealed. ‘Rupert believes the stuff reported in the Press about him being a sad old man who has lost the plot has been put out there by Matthew,’ said one source. ‘The galling thing for Rupert is that when Matthew married Elisabeth, he cashed in on the Murdoch name. Now he is going around trashing Murdoch.’ Four months before Freud’s birthday bash, it was Mr Blair who was missing when he was ‘disinvited’ from the high-profile Sun Valley media conference in Idaho, after Mr Murdoch told organisers he would boycott it if Mr Blair turned up. The Freud-Murdoch dispute is the latest development in the fast spreading fall-out between Murdoch and Mr Blair over Ms Deng, which has sent shockwaves through their close-knit and wealthy social circle. Mr Murdoch discovered his wife had 'multiple encounters' with Mr Blair, including weekend strays at Mr Murdoch's US homes without his knowledge . Persistent reports that their 14-year marriage was in trouble came to a head earlier this year when Mr Murdoch discovered his wife had ‘multiple encounters’ with Mr Blair, including weekend strays at Mr Murdoch’s US homes without his knowledge. Weeks later, Mr Murdoch filed for divorce. Friends of Mr Blair stress that he was ‘not cited in the divorce proceedings’. Mr Freud, 50, is one of the most powerful and best connected men in Britain. He and Elisabeth, who he married in 2001, have a joint fortune of £250 million. The success of Mr Freud, great grandson of psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud, owes much to his pragmatic approach to business and politics – aided by generous entertaining. He counts Mr Blair, Mr Cameron and former News Of The World editor Rebekah Brooks as close friends.His PR company Freud Communications advises Walkers Crisps, KFC, drinks company Diageo – and the Department of Health. Mr Murdoch¿s supporters claim Mr Freud 'joined forces' with Ms Deng in his own battle with Mr Murdoch . The Murdoch-Freud dispute over Mr Blair comes amid an increasingly bitter rivalry between the  two men, linked to the battle to inherit the media empire of 82-year-old Mr Murdoch. Mr Freud told The Mail on Sunday last night: ‘It would be very sad if these opinions apparently anonymously attributed to my father-in-law are accurate. He has certainly said nothing to me personally. ‘I will be eternally grateful to Rupert Murdoch for producing  Elisabeth, who is practically perfect in every way. Our views differ quite dramatically on a number of subjects professionally and I regret that this has caused my relationship with him to be sometimes conflicted. ‘But we have had good times as well as bad times, we both love his daughter and his grandchildren, if not always each other. ‘I do not believe anything else is terribly important.’","A source close to Murdoch said snub was a 'very public v-sign'

"Insane: Anders Breivik is suffering from paranoid schizophrenia according to two psychologists . Norwegian gunman Anders Breivik could avoid prison after two psychologists found he was insane during his July 22 massacre. If a court agrees with that assessment, the self-declared anti-Muslim militant cannot be sentenced to prison but will be subjected to compulsory psychiatric care, prosecutors told reporters in Oslo. 'The conclusions of the forensic experts is that Anders Behring Breivik was insane,' prosecutor Svein Holden said, adding Breivik was in a state of psychosis during Norway's worst peacetime massacre. In Norway, an insanity defense requires that a defendant be in a state of psychosis while committing the crime with which he or she is charged. That means the defendant has lost contact with reality to the point that he's no longer in control of his own actions. The 243-page report will be reviewed by a panel from the Norwegian Board of Forensic Medicine, which could ask for additional information and add its own opinions. The head of that panel told had reporters in July that it was unlikely that Breivik would be declared legally insane because the attacks were so carefully planned and executed. Breivik last month admitted killing 77 people, including eight in a bombing in central Oslo. But the 32-year-old right-wing extremist denies criminal guilt because he believes the massacre was necessary to save Norway and Europe. Disturbing: Police and rescue groups recover some of the last remaining bodies from Utoeya Island after Breivik, posing as a police officer, shot dead 69 during a rampage at a youth camp . Devastation: Smoke billows from a 17-storey government building after Breivik's bomb rocked central Oslo on July 22 killing eight people . The two psychiatrists, in their report, concluded that Breivik lived in his 'own delusional universe where all his thoughts and acts are guided by his delusions'. In a rambling manifesto posted on the Internet before the attacks, Breivik wrote that his arrest would open 'the propaganda phase' of his operation to ignite a war to defend Europe against a supposed Muslim takeover. Investigators say Breivik set off a fertilizer bomb outside the government headquarters on July 22, killing eight people, before heading to an island retreat, where youth sections of Norway’s governing Labour Party were gathered for their annual summer camp. Guises of a killer: Anders Behring Breivik in . military uniform (left) which he had requested to wear at a previous . court hearing and (right) in an image found in a manifesto attributed to . the anti-Islam extremist earlier this year . Disguised as a police officer, he opened fire on scores of panicked youth, shooting some of them as they fled into the lake. Sixty-nine people were killed on Utoeya island before Breivik surrendered to a police SWAT team. The carnage left Norway shocked and continues to haunt a nation that sees itself as peaceful and tolerant. An online manifesto attributed to Breivik sheds light on his choice of targets. In it, he lays out a blueprint for a multi-phase revolution, targeting left-leaning political elites he accuses of destroying their own societies by admitting large numbers of immigrants, especially from Muslim countries. His actions were widely condemned, including by the anti-Islamic bloggers and groups that he cited prolifically in the document. Oil-producing Norway, home to the Nobel Peace Prize, is known for its open society and relative prosperity, but the attacks sparked a public debate about immigration, security and a legal system which never had to cope with such an event.","Report by two forensic psychiatrists say Breivik is a paranoid schizophrenic who was in a psychotic state during his rampage .

"The only surviving example of the world's first aircraft carrier which measures just 58ft long has been restored. A far cry from the Royal Navy's new 920ft aircraft carrier Queen Elizabeth, the tiny boat could carry just one plane which was launched by towing it behind another boat into the wind. The simple vessels were used to launch First World War biplanes from the middle of the sea so they could attack German airships before they reached Britain. Fleet Air Arm Musuem curator Dave Morris with the world's first aircraft carrier, which was found rusting on the banks of the Thames . The craft, loaded with a biplane, being towed behind another boat ahead of a launch . A Sopwith Camel plane would be strapped to the deck of the boat and taken out to sea before being towed into the wind at over 20 knots. Crew had to hold the plane back while the pilot got the engine up to speed then release the chocks at the right moment. The pilot had just 58 feet of 'runway' to get the plane airborne or it would plummet into the sea with disastrous consequences. And even if the plane made it into the air, the only way the pilot could land again was by crashing into the sea in the hope of being rescued. The craft were the brainchild of the British Admiralty, who built them in a bid to end the destruction caused by bombs dropped on Britain by German zeppelins. The plane would be launched by the towing vessel steering into the wind and speeding up until there was enough lift to get the plane airbourne . The pilot had just 58 feet of 'runway' to get the plane off the deck or it would plummet into the sea . By launching planes out to sea the zeppelins could be intercepted and shot down before they could unleash their deadly payloads. The only existing example of the . craft, called a seaplane lighter, was discovered rusting on the banks of . the River Thames by a passing naval historian in 1996. It was salvaged by experts at the Fleet Air Arm Museum who have spent 12 years restoring it to its former glory. They now plan to give it pride of place in a new entrance hall at the museum in Yeovil, Somerset, with a restored Sopwith Camel mounted on it. Dave Morris, curator of aircraft at the Fleet Air Arm Museum, said: 'The boat came to us after it was spotted on the banks of the Thames. LENGTH - 57.97 feet  WIDTH - 16 feet . DEPTH - 6.89 feet .

'It was actually in remarkable . condition. We have stripped back the Thames Barge paint that covered it . and returned it to its original First World War condition. 'It's incredible to compare it to aircraft carriers of today, but believe it or not this is where it all started.' The deadly effect of the basic craft was displayed on August 10, 1918 when Lieutenant Stuart Culley took off from one for the first time. After completing the daring launch, Lt Culley climbed to 19,000ft before opening fire on zeppelin L53, sending the giant airship down in a ball of flame into the North Sea. The mission was so successful the Germans, petrified of the Brits' new aerial capabilities, stopped all zeppelin attacks on Britain. Lt Culley was awarded the Distinguished Service Order in recognition of his bravery during the attack. The vessel's take-off ramp being constructed during the First World War . Mr Morris said: 'It's incredible to compare it to aircraft carriers of today, but believe it or not this is where it all started' The seaplane lighters would be dwarfed by the Navy's new state of the art Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers, which are 920ft long and can carry 40 fighter jets. Dave Morris, said: 'It is one of the great World War One pieces still in existence and among just a few original large objects remaining. 'During the war the Admiralty decided they needed to to be able to launch planes from the sea, and came up with the idea of a small craft that could be towed behind a destroyer or frigate. The aircraft carrier would launch Sopwith Camel biplanes, like that pictured above (top) with a German Fokker tri-plane (below) 'Planes had been put on the back of ships before but this was the first ever boat purpose built for launching aircraft from. Fifty were ordered and 35 ended up being built. 'The concept was that the seaplane lighter would be towed out into the middle of the sea with a plane loaded on it. 'It would then be towed at speeds of . up to 20 knots into a headwind of the same strength thereby creating . enough lift for the plane to take off. 'Initially the planes used were . flying boats that could land on water but then on July 21 1918 . Lieutenant Stuart Culley proved it possible to take off using a Sopwith . Camel biplane. 'It was an incredibly dangerous task because the plane had to be airborne by the time it got to the end of the 58ft deck. 'If it wasn't it would fall off the front and then be hit by the lighter, resulting in instant death for the pilot. 'Even if the plane got airborne the pilot had to carry out a daring mission at 17,000ft, all the time exposed to the elements. 'The . big snag was that unless the mission was taking place in sight of land, . the only option was for the pilot to crash land the plane in the sea . close to the flagship and hope he was rescued. 'Three weeks after Lt Culley's test flight he took off on a mission in the North Sea and shot down zepellin L53. 'It . was hugely risky but it gave the British troops a massive advantage . over the Germans and all but ended the threat from zepellins overnight.'","First of its kind First World War aircraft carrier was towed by another boat .

"Bionic mother Corinne Hutton will become the first person in the UK to have a double hand transplant in September . When ‘bionic mum’ Corinne Hutton had both hands and feet amputated because of a devastating illness she promised her five-year-old son she would be re-built. One year later she’s been true to her word. The 44-year-old had two hi-tech prosthetic legs fitted, she was recently given a £35,000 robot hand and now she’s had the go ahead for the final and most astonishing piece of the remarkable human reconstruction. Mrs Hutton is to undergo the UK’s first double hand transplant later this year. The operation will be carried out by Professor Simon Kay, the same surgeon who successfully performed the first single hand transplant last year. And if all goes well son Rory will ‘get his mummy back’ as promised. Businesswoman Mrs Hutton, of Lochwinnoch, Renfrewshire, set up the charity Finding Your Feet within days of losing all four limbs in June last year. Thanks to the funds raised through her charity, the outdoor enthusiast, who has previously run a marathon, has already managed to ride a bike and is determined to be walking and running in the hills again before long. Mrs Hutton was accepted for the publicly-funded life-changing surgery at Leeds General Infirmary after undergoing rigorous physical and psychological tests. If the operation goes well Mrs Hutton should get some sensation in her hands immediately, but it could take many months for the new hands to settle down and function to improve. The mother-of-one will take anti-rejection drugs for the rest of her life. However, she believes she is in a win-win situation. ‘I thought with a transplant they’d cut away my wrists and if it failed I’d be much worse off. But they said the donor’s hands would attach to my wrists and therefore if it fails I’m no worse off.’ Mrs Hutton, who owns a Glasgow-based graphics company, said she had already spoken to the first hand transplant patient Mark Cahill, 51, about the operation. ‘I've been told that it's psychologically tough. I like to think that I'd be grateful to whoever had given me those hands. I spoke to Mark and he agreed that was his angle on it.’ Mrs Hutton, who is mother to five-year-old Rory, lost both hands and lower legs in June last year, when a bad cough turned into pneumonia and septicaemia and her vital organs began to shut down . The 44-year-old already has two bionic hands, allowing her to carry out day-to-day tasks, as well as a pair of 'cosmetic' hands . The double hand transplant surgery – likely to be carried out in the autumn - will involve four surgical teams and skin from the donor’s forearms will be used to cover scarring on Mrs Hutton’s arms. Professor Kay said the operation will be more complex than surgery on Mr Cahill but he told the BBC he believed the results will be ‘exceptional’. It will certainly cap an astonishing transformation from the moment when doctors gave Mrs Hutton just a 5 per cent chance of survival as she fought for her life in hospital. 'I just want to be a normal mum who can do normal things for Rory and normal things with Rory' - Corinne Hutton . Her ordeal began when a bad cough turned into pneumonia and septicaemia. Her vital organs began to shut down. Mrs Hutton was flown down from Glasgow to a specialist unit in Leicester. She was linked up to an Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) machine to oxygenate her blood and it saved her life. She returned to Glasgow, but the illness and her treatment starved her hands and feet of blood and the devastated mother required a quadruple amputation. Her hands were cut off from the wrists and her legs from below the knees. Mrs Hutton bravely endured seven operations, spending 30 to 40 hours in theatre, but immediately set about getting back on her feet. The first stage of Mrs Hutton's re-building operation took place earlier this year when she travelled to Dubai to be given two state-of-the-art prosthetic legs costing £16,000. It is set to be completed this September when Mrs Hutton becomes the first person in the UK to have a double hand transplant . Mrs Hutton's operation will be carried out by Professor Simon Kay, the same surgeon who completed the first successful single hand transplant on Mark Cahill, pictured, last year . She formed a charity to raise funds to help her and other people in her situation and so far it has raised around £200,000 from a variety of events. The first stage of her re-building operation took place earlier this year when Mrs Hutton travelled to Dubai to be given two state-of-the-art prosthetic legs costing £16,000. Then earlier this month she was fitted with a ‘bionic’ left hand, which picks up signals from her brain telling her to point a finger or clench her fist. ‘I’ve learnt to do a lot of things, I can use my smartphone, I do my own make up with both hands, I can dress myself, but there are a lot of things I can’t do,’ said Miss Hutton, who also has fake ‘cosmetic hands’. She said her son had ‘got his mum back’, adding: ‘I just want to be a normal mum who can do normal things for Rory and normal things with Rory.’ That process should be complete with the ground-breaking double transplant operation.","Corinne Hutton lost both hands and lower legs in June last year .

"The UK financial markets yesterday suffered their biggest one-day loss in a year amid fears over the ebola virus and global economic concerns. As America’s health authorities warned about the spread of the disease, an alarming slump on the London Stock Market was followed by a dramatic dip on Wall Street. Millions of shareholders, including the big pension funds, were left with heavy losses last night after stocks fell, wiping as much as £46billion off the value of Britain’s biggest listed companies. The FTSE100 index of leading shares in London tumbled by as much as 2.8 per cent, or 181.04 points, to close at 6211.64, its biggest plunge in a day for a year. It has lost 10 per cent in the last week. A Red Cross member sterilises the dead body of a victim of the ebola virus in Monrovia, Liberia yesterday.

"Rampant Nigel Farage aims to destroy the Tory Party, take over a new Right-wing British political party, get Britain out of the EU - and then quit politics. The UKIP leader’s breathtaking ambition, revealed in an interview with The Mail on Sunday, comes hours before he is set to achieve a historic victory in the European elections. The results from Thursday’s polling, announced today, are expected to show UKIP will have gained more than 20 MEPs, more than the Conservatives, with the possibility of a total wipeout of all Lib Dem MEPs. Scroll down for video . Triumphant: Nigel Farage at his home in Kent on the eve of the European election results. The UKIP leader hopes to have Britain out of Europe within a decade . Mr Farage rejects claims by David Cameron that UKIP’s challenge will fade away in next year’s General Election, and says today’s gains mark the beginning of the end of the Conservative Party. He aims to repeat the destruction two decades ago of Canada’s Conservative Party, when the rebel Right-wing Reform Party, compared by many to UKIP, sparked a political earthquake. In an interview with this newspaper earlier in the campaign, Mr Farage said a Canadian-style Tory meltdown ‘could happen’ here – and compared attacks on him to those on Reform Party leader Preston Manning and Reform’s first Canadian MP, schoolteacher Deborah Grey. ‘They called him a Right-wing extremist, a nutter, away with the fairies, he’ll never get anywhere and what happens? They won one by-election, a schoolmistress way out West, who resisted every bribe and temptation to rejoin the Conservative Party. ‘Now you have a Canadian Prime Minister, Stephen Harper, who was first elected on a Reform ticket, as were half the Cabinet. ‘Don’t think this can’t happen here. The public want something different. We are catalysing a big change in British politics on fundamental issues that have been brushed under the carpet and ignored by a completely out-of-touch career political class for too long.’ Ambition: Nigel Farage dismissed jibes that the rise of UKIP will hand power to pro-EU Ed Miliband at the next General Election by taking votes from the Tories . Canada’s Conservative Party was destroyed overnight in the country’s 1993 election by the populist, low-tax, Reform Party. The century-old ruling Progressive Conservatives lost all but two of their 156 seats after sensational gains by Reform, which had been called racist, sexist and homophobic, just as David Cameron famously called UKIP ‘fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists’. The split in Canada’s Centre Right enabled the Liberals, Canada’s equivalent of our Labour Party, to take power. But after ten years of infighting, the Reform revolution succeeded. The Canadian Alliance, a merger of Reform with the ruins of Canada’s old-style Tories, led to former Reform official Stephen Harper becoming Prime Minister in 2006. And it had all started with the  victory of a sole Reform MP, Ms Grey, in 1989. Mr Farage hopes a victory by UKIP’s Roger Helmer in the Newark Parliamentary by-election on June 5 will trigger a similar political shake-up at Westminster. In his interview with The Mail on Sunday, Mr Farage dismissed jibes that the rise of UKIP will hand power to pro-EU Ed Miliband at the next General Election by taking votes from the Tories. He said: ‘The arithmetic doesn’t suggest that. Firstly, the reason Conservative voters have deserted the party is that they do not believe Cameron is Conservative. It’s got nothing to do with me, but thinking there is going to be a Conservative majority is fantasy. ‘The second reason is the Tories are dying as brand in the North of England just as they did in Scotland.The third reason Cameron can’t win a majority is he can’t get the blue-collar vote. Thatcher got it, Reagan got it, John Major got it. But these two guys (Cameron and Osborne) who allegedly don’t know the price of a pint of milk, don’t connect with the blue collar.’ Celebration: Nigel Farage aims to use UKIP's new support from Labour voters to force a weakened Ed Miliband to take a tougher stance on the EU in next year's election . While Farage says publicly an Ed Miliband victory next year would be a ‘disaster for the economy,’ some of those who know the UKIP leader well claim that in private, he says it could help him achieve a Canadian-style upheaval here. One UKIP aide said: ‘If Miliband wins, the Tories would be shattered and split with Eurosceptics on one side and Europhiles on the other. Nigel could team up with the Eurosceptics and possibly lead them. And, if, as Nigel believes, Miliband would be a pathetically poor PM, a Labour Government could collapse quickly with another election. Then, the Canadian scenario is on.’ Mr Farage aims to use UKIP’s new support from Labour voters to force a weakened Ed Miliband to take a tougher stance on the EU in next year’s election. ‘If I want to get this country out of the EU, I have got to change the position of the Labour Party on the referendum. If you accept it is impossible for Cameron to win a majority on his own, there could be a UKIP-Tory coalition after the election. Who knows? If it looks less and less likely that Miliband can form a majority without a referendum pledge, he’ll do it.’ Farage, 50, insists he is not interested in power for himself – and by the time he turns 60, wants to have quit politics – with Britain out of  the EU. ‘I will consider my job’s done and I would be very happy to hand over to people who might be very good at running the country. I’m in politics because I want to change things, not because I want a career. I don’t want to do this for ever, I don’t want to sit here in ten years’ time, I want to be doing something else by then, in the media, radio, writing, hopefully enjoying myself.’ He has no desire to move into  No 10, emulating ‘Canada’s Nigel Farage’ Stephen Harper. ‘I think I could do it but do I think that’s really what I would be best at in life? ‘No. What I’m best at is spotting when something’s wrong and needs to change and agitating to wake people up to what’s gone wrong.’ Pressure on embattled Ed Miliband grew last night after a survey showed Labour would have more chance of winning the next election if they dump him. A Survation poll for the Mail on Sunday revealed that 31 per cent of Labour supporters back the party at the ballot box ‘because of’ Miliband, while 36 per cent do so ‘despite’ him. By contrast, 48 per cent of Tories back the party because of Cameron, and 18 per cent support the party despite him. The leadership popularity gap was . repeated when voters were asked if they would be more likely to support a . party if it had a new leader. Voters said ‘yes’ by a margin of 26 per . cent in the case of Labour, compared to a margin of 13 per cent for the . Tories. The most common . criticism of Miliband in the poll, which saw 1,017 adults questioned . online on Friday, is that he lacks charisma and the ‘common touch’. City slicker: Sharp-suited Chuka Umunna (right) has emerged as the surprise new favourite to succeed current Labour leader Ed Miliband (left) Cameron was also seen as lacking the common touch but the Prime Minister fared significantly better on charisma. Mr Miliband will face further attacks today, with widespread forecasts of poor results in the European elections on top of similar disappointment in the town hall elections. The Labour leader, who has been criticised for failing to stop UKIP taking votes in his party’s Northern heartlands, is due to launch a fightback on Tuesday. He will say in a speech: ‘I am determined to show people, including those who voted for UKIP, that we can change our country for the better.’ But a Shadow Minister said the attempt to win back voters was like ‘bolting the stable door after the UKIP horse has bolted’. The poll also revealed that Boris Johnson is the strong favourite to succeed Mr Cameron, backed by 44 per cent of Tories. He is followed by Theresa May and George Osborne. Energy Secretary Ed Davey has emerged as Lib Dem favourite to succeed Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, with support from 32 per cent of the party’s voters, followed by Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander with Vince Cable a distant third place. Meanwhile sharp-suited Chuka Umunna has emerged as the surprise new favourite to succeed Ed Miliband, according to the poll. In previous surveys, Umunna has lagged behind other Labour hopefuls. But those who voted in the Survation poll did so after watching videos of Miliband’s potential successors. The survey saw Shadow Business Secretary Umunna, 35, triumph over bookmakers’ favourite Yvette Cooper, the Shadow Home Secretary. Little-known Umunna was seen as ‘more charismatic, normal, in touch and trustworthy’ among Labour supporters than any of his rival leadership contenders. Asked who would be most likely to make them vote Labour, Umunna won again, and he also stormed to victory in the ‘better than Miliband’ category. Dubbed the ‘British Obama’, Manchester University-trained lawyer Umunna was fast-tracked into the Shadow Cabinet. But his ‘rising star’ status has led to him being taunted by David Cameron and privately mocked by some of his Labour colleagues.","UKIP leader reveals ambitions ahead of European election results .

"Seven men have been arrested in connection with a sexual assault on a 19-year-old woman in Tahrir Square while thousands celebrated the inauguration of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. The arrests come amid growing outrage as a video emerged purportedly showing a woman being stripped naked and attacked. It is not clear whether her attackers were among those arrested for Sunday's violence. Police were investigating 27 other complaints of sexual harassment against women during Sunday's rallies by tens of thousands of people celebrating al-Sisi's inauguration late into the night, security officials said. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Seven men have been arrested in connection with a sexual assault on a 19-year-old woman during celebrations in Tahrir Square to mark the inauguration of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. Celebrations were also taking place in the square when the results of the election were confirmed on June 3 . Last week, the Egypt government issued a new law which punishes sexual harassment with at least six months in jail or fines of at least 3,000 Egyptian pounds ($420). Judicial sources said the arrests were made under the new law. Sexual assault was rampant at demonstrations during and after the 2011 uprising against then-president Hosni Mubarak and is common at large gatherings in Egypt. Local activists and foreign journalists are among those who have been attacked. Twenty-nine women's rights groups have released a joint statement accusing the government of failing to do enough to address the spiralling outbreak of mob attacks on women. The groups said they had documented more than 250 cases of 'mass sexual rape and mass sexual assaults' from November 2012 to January 2014. 'Combatting that phenomena requires a comprehensive national strategy,' said the statement signed by the women's groups. In the latest incident, video footage posted on social media purportedly shows a woman completely naked amid a crowd of men, as policemen struggled to escort her out of Tahrir. The Interior Ministry, in charge of . police, identified the seven suspects and gave their ages as between 15 . and 49. It said they were arrested for 'harassing several girls' but . made no mention of the student. A policeman was injured while the seven . were being arrested, the ministry added. Police were investigating 27 other complaints of sexual harassment against women during Sunday's rallies by tens of thousands of people celebrating al-Sisi's inauguration late into the night, security officials said. Celebrations were also held in the square when it was confirmed al-Sisi won the election on June 3 . Prosecutors are detaining them for four days pending investigations, judicial sources said. Two of the men admitted beating a woman, while five denied any wrongdoing and said the women had provoked them, the sources added. Authorities investigating other reports of sexual assaults were examining a dozen videos from security cameras or from bystanders who filmed the incidents on their mobile phones, the officials said. They said the footage suggested organized attacks, with groups of men luring victims away from densely crowded spots before encircling them as they assaulted them. Many brandished knives which they used to threaten victims or against anyone attempting to come to their rescue. Sexual harassment, high rates of female genital cutting and a surge in violence after the Arab Spring uprisings have made Egypt the worst country in the Arab world to be a woman, a Thomson Reuters Foundation survey showed late last year. The state news agency MENA reported that the public prosecutor was listening to the statements of victims and suspects, and had ordered forensic examinations for the women. It said initial investigations revealed that 'criminal elements...had harassed some of the women in the square...in an attempt to spoil the celebrations'. A U.N. report on women last year said 99.3 percent of women and girls had been subjected to sexual harassment in Egypt, which some analysts say reflects a general rise in violence in Egyptian society over the past half-decade. Many say Egyptian society as a whole needs to take sexual harassment more seriously. Further uproar was caused by comments made by a TV anchorwoman during a live report from a correspondent covering the Tahrir celebrations. When a correspondent told the anchorwoman there had been several cases of sexual harassment, she laughed and said it's 'because they are happy.' The anchorwoman denied Monday that her comment was in response to the harassment incidents. 'I was, along with my guests, commenting on people's joy, not the harassment,' she said on her Facebook page. The anti-sexual harassment decree issued last week amends Egypt's current laws on the abuse. Those convicted face six months to five years in prison, with the maximum punishment reserved for offenders holding positions of power over their victims, such as when the offender is the woman's boss or is armed. Repeat offenders would see their sentences doubled, the decree said. Along with the maximum five-year sentence, offenders can be fined up to 5,000 Egyptian pounds, or about $714.","Arrests come amid growing outrage as video purportedly showing attack posted online .

"Britain is still giving China millions of pounds in aid even though the Communist superpower is so wealthy it has just sent a rocket to the moon. Official figures seen by the Daily Mail reveal that Britain gave Beijing £27.4million last year – making a mockery of ministerial assurances that the programme was to stop. The revelation comes days after China flaunted its might by successfully landing a probe on the lunar surface. And only two weeks ago David Cameron went to Beijing to seek Chinese investment to improve Britain’s ailing infrastructure. Britain is still giving China £27m in aid despite David Cameron (pictured) visiting Beijing two weeks ago to seek investment from the Communist superpower . The government has been critised for providing aid to China, which is so wealthy it has sent a rocket to the moon . Government officials said UK money went on programmes to combat climate change and help economic growth. But Tory MP Peter Bone called on International Development Secretary Justine Greening to explain why UK aid was still going to China and 14 other nations that had been judged ineligible. ‘The public will be rightly horrified that we are still wasting money on aid to China,’ he said. ‘It is extraordinary that we are doing this while they send a mission to the moon. If these aid programmes are still continuing then I think Justine Greening needs to come to Parliament and explain what the justification is, because I can’t think of one.’ China has poured billions into its space programme. The landing of its Jade Rabbit lunar rover on Saturday was watched on state TV by 1.4billion Chinese. Ministers have issued repeated assurances that aid to China has stopped, saying in 2010 that it was ‘not justifiable’ to send millions to an economic superpower. Critics have called on International Development Secretary Justine Greening to explain why UK aid was still going to China and 14 other nations that had been judged ineligible . But figures slipped out by the Department . for International Development (Dfid) reveal that China – the world’s . second biggest economy with almost £2trillion in reserves – received . £27.4 million last year, enough to pay for almost 1,000 UK nurses. It was one of 16 countries that supposedly had its aid programme axed following a review by Andrew Mitchell, then International Development Secretary, in 2011. But Dfid figures reveal that 15 of the countries were still receiving a total of £131.9million British aid last year. Vietnam was given £51.5million, Cambodia £14.5million, Indonesia £11.3million and Kosovo £10.2million. Smaller sums went to Angola, Bosnia, Burundi, Cameroon, Gambia, Iraq, Lesotho, Moldova, Niger and Serbia. Only Russia’s small aid programme was ended. Ministers have faced persistent criticism for sending aid to countries wealthy enough to develop their own space projects. India, which received £290million in 2012, last month launched a rocket to survey the surface of Mars. Nigeria was handed £208million despite being able to afford a programme to launch satellites. China has poured billions into its space programme including the landing of its Jade Rabbit lunar rover on Saturday . Pauline Latham, a Tory member of the Commons international development committee, said she was ‘very surprised’ at the revelation, adding: ‘When China is sending missions to the moon it is quite clear they no longer need our help.’ Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers Alliance, said: ‘Taxpayers expect UK aid to be helping people in the world’s poorest nations.’ A Government spokesman said it was right to continue to work with non-governmental partners on global issues such as economic growth and climate change. Last year’s aid package to China included almost £5million from the Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC), which is owned by Dfid, and £22.5million from the Foreign Office. A CDC spokesman said it had been ‘legally and contractually bound’ to hand over the money as part of an ongoing investment deal.","Revelation comes days after China successfully landed probe on the moon .

"Migrant parents care more about their children’s education than those from white working-class backgrounds, Ofsted’s chief said yesterday. Sir Michael Wilshaw attacked the mothers and fathers who failed to support their youngsters with homework and reading after school. Pupils from migrant, black and Asian families were getting more backing at home – and it is helping them outperform their white classmates, he said. Sir Michael told the BBC’s Today programme: ‘Family is important and we need to send a message out to parents that they need to support their children. Sir . Michael Wilshaw, a former head teacher, suggested immigrant families . cared more about their children's education than white working class . Brits . There are parts of our communities – . particularly people from immigrant groups, ethnic minority groups, where . their children are doing fantastically well because their parents . support them.’ Former head teacher Sir Michael has previously called  for parents to be fined for not helping children with their homework. Reiterating the demand yesterday, he said: ‘If parents don’t support their children and do badly there should be sanctions. 'I think it’s important that families and parents support the school.’ His comments tally with a recent Commons’ education select committee report warning that the under-achievement of white working-class pupils is ‘quite staggeringly low’. Research last year by the Centre for Social Justice revealed that in 2012, only 26 per cent of poor white British boys gained five A* to C grades at GCSE including English and maths. But 40 per cent of black boys achieved the same result, against a country-wide figure of 63 per cent. And earlier this week an immigrant mother wrote in the Mail how Asian values could prevent indigenous British children performing badly by understanding how learning can pave the way to a better life. Later yesterday, at the Festival of Education at Wellington College, Berkshire, Sir Michael warned that thousands of pupils were being let down by the ‘baleful legacy’ of trendy teaching methods and poor discipline at ‘bog standard’ comprehensives. The pervasiveness of 1960s and 70s teaching methods meant state secondaries were associated with ‘mediocrity, laxity and failure’, he said. Its fallout could be seen in the toleration of poor behaviour, the ‘disdain’ for competitive sports and the ‘half-hearted pursuit’ of high academic standards. Singling out the once-fashionable concept of ‘individualised learning’ – the belief that criticism and adult supervision stifle youthful creativity – he said: ‘Its legacy still lingers in some schools today: academic rigour is undervalued; basic literacy and numeracy are neglected; subject specialism is relegated in favour of cross-curricula muddle.’ Weak head teachers who remain resistant to academic rigour and the importance of tests were also attacked. Sir Michael insisted that good leadership was essential in ‘the battle against tired ideologies and harmful classroom practices’. Head teachers must insist that the curriculum is ‘academically robust’ and confront parents who refuse to take responsibility for their children, such as flouting uniform rules. He now wants to ‘reclaim the comprehensive ideal’, insisting that it is the only approach to ‘address the educational needs of the entire country’. He added: ‘Phrases such as “behaviour management” are still bandied around as if a child’s conduct is something to be negotiated. It smacks of compromise and containment. It undermines authority.’","Sir Michael Wilshaw says bad parents should be fined to raise standards .

"With its ban on alcohol and rules ordering women to cover up, it is not the most obvious summer holiday destination. But that has not stopped Iran from experiencing a surge in tourism from the UK, with bookings at travel agencies up by as much as 400 per cent. For years, the hardline regime of anti-western former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad put off all but the most adventurous travellers. But the arrival of football-loving Hassan Rouhani as his successor last year appears to have made the Middle Eastern country seem friendlier. Imam Mosque in Imam Square in Esfahan Iran - which is now becoming a tourist hotspot, according to travel agents . Jonny Bealby, managing director of Wild Frontiers, which has been organising trips to Iran for ten years, hopes to send up to 150 customers this year, compared with a few dozen in 2013. Mr Bealby said: ‘With the new man in charge and the easing of relations, a lot more people feel safe to go there.’ In the Ahmadinejad years, Mr Bealby . said his company would provide just one or two organised tours for up to . 12 people at a time, and arrange ‘a handful’ of trips for individuals . or couples. ‘Things have . changed completely this year,’ he said. ‘In 2012, it was hard to sell . Iran at all and in 2013 we had just two group tours running. This year . we are running nine. ‘We are also providing tailor-made trips for dozens more people. In total, we are approaching 150 bookings so far in 2014.’ Wild Frontiers’ group tours cost . £2,795 per person for a fortnight or £1,995 for 10 days, taking in . ancient fortresses, mosques, bazaars, royal gardens and Iran’s National . Museum in Tehran, which displays its crown jewels and peacock throne. There are no direct flights from the UK to Iran so travellers have to change in either Istanbul or Dubai. Mr . Bealby said: ‘Travel to Iran has never been a problem in the years . we’ve been running tours. As long as people going there are sensible, we . have partners in Iran who know what they are doing and our customers . are well looked-after.’ The arrival of football-loving Hassan Rouhani last year appears to have made the Middle Eastern country seem friendlier . ‘The . issue has always been the way Iran has been perceived. Under . Ahmadinejad this was a particular problem, especially with the attack on . the British Embassy in Tehran in 2011 but with the new man in charge . and the easing of relations, a lot more people feel safe to go there.’ Sarah Bareham, marketing executive at Brighton-based Responsible Travel, which also organises tours of the country, said: ‘Since January we have had the same number of bookings that we had in the whole of 2013.’ Michael Pullman, marketing manager at Wild Frontiers, based in Barnes, south London, has just returned from one of the company’s tours to Iran and describes the country as ‘amazing’. He said: ‘It was a really interesting place, full of history, amazing architecture and mosques. ‘Probably the biggest surprise was how friendly and welcoming the people were - everywhere we went we were surrounded by people wanting to ask us questions about topics ranging from politics to the Premier League. ‘The officials were very low-key and although they probably knew where we were, there wasn’t any visible presence monitoring our movements.’ Among the hotels Mr Pullman stayed in was the 300-year-old Abbassi Hotel, Esfahan, a one-time favourite of the Shah prior to the 1979 Islamic revolution. He said: ‘The hotels were all clean and comfortable but there was an atmosphere faded grandeur, which is a symptom of the economic sanctions and Iran having been off the tourist map for so long. ‘There were very few Brits but we met a few French and Germans.’ But despite the friendly welcome, Mr Pullman said alcohol remains banned, women have to disguise their body shape and wear scarves and, while men are permitted western clothing, shorts are not allowed. Other down-sides include Western credit or debit cards not working in Iran, so tourists need to bring cash to exchange. Wild Frontiers’ brochure describes ‘fascinating’ Iran as ‘one of the most misunderstood countries on earth’. Other specialist travel agencies have also reported rising bookings for Iran in the last 12 months. But Government advice on trips to the Middle Eastern country remains cautious. A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman said: ‘We would advise people to keep up to date with our relevant travel advice on Iran. ‘We advise against all but essential travel to the country as a whole and against all travel to regions close to the Iraq and Afghanistan borders. ‘There are risks for British nationals in Iran and especially those going off the beaten track - but it’s a matter of choice for individuals.’","Hardline regime of former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad put off travellers .

"This sickening image shows armed Taliban militants standing over decapitated heads which they claim belong to soldiers they killed in clashes on the Pakistan border. The Pakistani Taliban released a video showing what appeared to be the severed heads of a dozen soldiers today as security officials said 15 troops were missing following fighting with insurgents. The clashes on Tuesday came as part of a Pakistan army operation to repel Taliban militants who had crossed over from Kunar province in Afghanistan last Friday and occupied the village of Batwar in the Bajaur tribal district. Horrendous: Taliban militants stand over a dozen . decapitated heads which they claim belong to soldiers they killed in . clashes on the Pakistan border . 'At least 15 of our soldiers are still missing,' a senior security official told AFP. Another security official said 'more or less' that many soldiers were missing but declined to give the exact total. Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) spokesman Sirajud Din sent AFP a video showing a militant commander posing with 12 heads arranged on the ground which he claimed were from soldiers they had killed. 'Praise be to God that the mujahideen in Bajaur agency have managed to kill the infidel soldiers of Pakistan,' he says. 'Many of them were killed by bullets, 12 of them as you see have been beheaded, you see 12 heads here, and more heads are on the way.' The commander, his face unmasked and wearing traditional tribal dress, is flanked in the footage by around a dozen armed men including one wielding a huge axe. The video showed belongings from the dead men laid out on a sheet, including Pakistani identity cards, camouflage pattern helmets, Pakistani currency, mobile phones and bank cards. Military sources have so far not said whether they are the missing soldiers or confirmed that those shown in the video are Pakistani troops. Killed: Mullah Dadullah, seen right, a regional . commander of Pakistani Taliban group Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan was . killed by a NATO airstrike late Friday. He was responsible for the . movement of fighters and weapons across the frontier as well as attacks . against Afghan and coalition forces in Afghanistan . The speaker said they had been killed to avenge 'brutalities' carried out by Pakistani troops. In July the TTP released a video showing the heads of 17 Pakistani soldiers they claimed to have killed in a cross-border attack on a checkpost in the northwestern district of Upper Dir. Intelligence officials blamed that attack on loyalists of Pakistani cleric Maulana Fazlullah, who fled to Afghanistan after losing control of the Swat valley to the army. Fighting in Bajaur in the past week has claimed at least 50 lives, including 31 militants and two members of a government-backed peace committee who were killed on Monday. Last week, a NATO airstrike in eastern Afghanistan killed a Pakistani Taliban leader who had close ties with al Qaeda, dealing a blow to the militants who operate on both sides of the countries' porous border. Mullah Dadullah was killed on Friday in Afghanistan's eastern Kunar province, which lies just across the border from the Pakistani tribal area of Bajur, the military alliance said. He was the Pakistani Taliban leader in Bajur, and NATO said Saturday that Dadullah also was responsible for the movement of fighters and weapons across the frontier as well as attacks against Afghan and coalition forces in Afghanistan. Bajaur is one of seven districts in Pakistan’s semi-autonomous tribal belt, where Taliban and al Qaeda-linked militants have carved out strongholds used to plot attacks on Pakistan. Pakistan has lost more than 3,000 soldiers in the fight against homegrown insurgents but has resisted US pressure to do more to eliminate havens used by those fighting the Americans in Afghanistan.","Pakistan Taliban claim they killed army fighters in clashes on Afghan border .

"James Gandolfini’s estate is about to be gutted by the federal government. Gandolfini will calls for 80% of his estate to go to his sisters and his 9-month-old daughter, according to reports, which subjects them to death taxes – which are levied at a rate of about 55%. The remaining 20% goes to his widow. As written, the will subjects everyone involved to significantly more taxation than is normally the case. Acclaimed: James Gandolfini accepting one of three Emmy awards for outstanding lead actor in a drama series for his work on 'The Sopranos' ‘It’s a nightmare from a tax standpoint,’ estate lawyer William Zabel told the New York Daily News, calling the segregation of assets a ‘big mistake’ saying the will is ‘a disaster.’ The enormous tax bill – about $30 million – will be due in about nine months, according to Zabel. Gandolfini, like most high net worth people, probably didn’t keep his assets in cash, which will force his family to sell off his multiple properties and liquidate other holdings to cover the bill, explained Zabel, but they will have a little wiggle room. ‘They can get an extension of time to pay the entire amount, but they're going to have pay a substantial amount in nine months,’ said Zabel. Famous: Portraying mob boss Tony Soprano on 'The Sopranos' made James Gandolfini a household name . Though the exact amount of Gandolfini’s estate is not known since an inventory does not have to be filed until December, estimating it to be worth $70 million leaves heirs to divvy up $40 million after taxes instead of $70 million before taxes, since the will calls for shares to be divided after settling the tax bill, according to the Daily News. This leaves Deborah Lin, the actor’s widow, with a significantly smaller share of the pie, according to Zabel. ""It's a catastrophe,"" the lawyer said. Loved: Gandolfini with his wife Deborah Lin and son Michael at a 2011 movie premiere . Untouched by the taxation issues will be a $7 million life insurance payout to Michael, the actor’s devastated 13-year-old son. Separate trust funds had also been set up for Gandofini’s wife and son prior to his passing, according to the Daily News. Gandolfini passed away last month in Rome after a massive heart attack. He was in Italy attending a film festival with his family. Any royalties from his lengthy acting career in film and television going into the estate would also be subject to death taxes. It’s not yet clear whether they are set up to go into trusts or the estate, the Daily News reported. Should the sisters and daughter renounce their shares in the estate, they would avoid taxes and be able to receive larger payments down the road, since they would default to Lin. Spouses are not subject to the same rates of inheritance taxes as others.","The former 'Sopranos' star is estimated to be worth about $70 million .

Ben Carlson, described as a veteran lifeguard, died yesterday near the city's pier after trying to rescue a swimmer. The lifeguard had entered the water from a rescue boat around 5pm and had reached the swimmer when they were both struck by 10-foot high waves, authorities said. Scroll down for video . Ben Carlson, 32, became the first Newport Beach lifeguard to die in the line of duty after drowning while going to the rescue of a distressed swimmer at the Orange County beach yesterday . 'He just loved being out on the water, he loved the opportunity to help people,' said his father, Chris Carlson . Rescuers took three hours to locate the teenager after he disappeared under a 10-foot high wave and were later seen tearfully consoling one another on Newport Beach . The swimmer made it back to shore, but Ben disappeared. Rescue officials said the teenager's colleagues were not immediately able to find him due to the turbulent water. After a three-hour search, which included a helicopter, more than 20 rescuers in the water and a similar amount supporting from the shore, the teenager was located around 8pm. Ben was pulled on to Newport Pier and taken to Hoag Hospital where he was pronounced dead. Newport Beach lifeguards rescued hundreds of swimmers over the weekend due to dangerous rip currents . Lifeguards tearfully consoled one another following the death. Beach Fire Department Chief Scott Poster told local media that Ben was 'there to help at every single moment'.

"A man who claims to have raised the murdered love child of Minnesota Vikings star Adrian Peterson said people should stop sympathizing with the player because he didn't even know the two-year-old, it emerged today. Bobby Ruffin posted a rant on his Facebook page after the boy's death on Friday saying he was the person who raised him and he was even named after him. The two-year-old was brutally beaten, allegedly at the . hands of his mother's abusive live-in boyfriend Joseph Patterson, last week and died soon after in hospital, which is where Peterson met his son for the first time. Dad: Bobby Ruffin posted a rant on his Facebook page after the boy's death on Friday saying he was the person who raised him and that the toddler  was even named after him . Professional: Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson said he never doubted that he would be playing in the game on Sunday but plans to attend his son's funeral this week . Notorious: Joseph Patterson, accused of beating NFL star Adrian . Peterson's 2-year-old son to death, has history of violence against . women and children with several counts of assault . 'So tired of this poor Adrian Peterson s**t. Let me blow all your minds,' Ruffin posted on his wall which was reported today by TMZ. 'The boy who died was my son. Yes AP was the biological father but I raised him and he carried . my name. Tyrese Robert Ruffin. 'I don’t blame AP for not really caring . cuz him and I both found out recently who the biological father was. AP met my son for the first time yest [sic] when my son was already in coma. 'I . was here today when we pulled the plug, not him. He was happily . practicing and has no problem playing on Sunday. 'So yea this isn’t all out yet but I’m sick of the poor AP s**t. He . didn’t know or even meet my son. Sorry for the outburst but put yourself . in my place.' It emerged earlier today Peterson . asked for a DNA test to confirm Tyrese was his around two or three . months ago before he offered to be a part of his life. The running back did not suspect he . was being targeted by an ex-girlfriend to scam money from him but wanted . definitive proof he was the child's biological father before making any . 'big moves'. Once the test . came back positive, Peterson promised to be a part of his son's life . and help him and his mom out financially, a source told TMZ. Sources say Peterson is planning to fly back to South Dakota to attend his son's funeral later this week after making the decision to play in . Sunday's NFL clash with the Carolina Panthers. Explaining his decision before the game he said: 'I’m still hurt and feel the pain of . life, but I’m able to function because of the peace and joy of knowing . my loved ones are in a much better place. 'I was set on it. I just look at things and I don't ask people to understand my mindset and how I think. Anything bad, I try to take good from it. 'That's the way I approach life in all situations. I never thought about not playing. It was all about just going out there and praying that I have the strength to get through and help my team. That was my focus.' In their thoughts: Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson, left, is hugged by Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton after the death of his son Ty . Fans held signs that read 'Stay . Strong 28' and 'Prayers for Adrian,' and several teammates offered hugs . and well wishes before the game. 'I . just prayed and asked God to give me the strength just to get through . the game, just play and focus,' Peterson said. 'And for the most part, I . did.' The Panthers beat the Vikings 35-10 in Sunday's game. Joseph Patterson is charged with aggravated assault and aggravated battery in the death of the two-year-old. Initially, police were told that the child had choked on candy. Only later did it emerge that his brain injuries were the result of being violently shaken. The arrest was made after police found the little boy with injuries 'consistent with abuse'. Patterson is being held in Minnehaha County Jail, South Dakota, on $750,000 cash bond and was scheduled to appear in court on October 23 but that will likely change in the wake of the toddler's death. Charged: Joseph Robert Patterson, 27,  is charged with aggravated battery of an infant and aggravated assault. It emerged in court that he had previously been charged over domestic violence . South Dakota State’s Attorney Thomas . Wollman filed motions on Friday ordering Patterson to serve two . year-long sentences that had been suspended on prior domestic assault . charges. Patterson had pleaded guilty in 2012 to simple assault in an incident involving an ex-girlfriend and her three-year-old son. The woman requested a protection . order saying the vicious man had spanked her little boy so hard that she . had to ice the welts on his buttocks, according to the Argus. She also said that he choked and . punched her, threatened her with a knife and held her in the bedroom . against her will, according to records. The woman asked for the protection orders prior to the birth of the son she has with Patterson. As part of his prior charges, . Patterson was ordered to undergo family violence training and to stay . away from the woman until completing it. A different woman requested a protection order against Patterson in 2004 in Jackson County. Thoughts and prayers: Minnesota Vikings fans have been expressing their support for Adrian Peterson and his family after the death of his two-year-old son. Here he is joined by Kyle Rudolph for the National Anthem before Sunday's NFL game . Working through the pain: Oftentimes athletes use work as a cathartic way to move through tragedy and will often dedicate their performance to those that they lost . Peterson has had tragedy peppered . throughout his life. When he was seven, he saw his older brother die in a . bike accident after being hit by a drunken driver. For . Peterson's teenage years, his father was in prison. He grew up poor in . east Texas. Shortly before the Minnesota Vikings drafted him in 2007, a . half-brother, was shot and killed. Long . before Peterson began running through the NFL record book, he learned . to turn tragedy into fuel for an exceptional career. 'Things . that I go through, I've said a thousand times, it helps me play this . game to a different level,'he said after practice, about an hour after . the child's death. 'I'm able to kind of release a lot of my stress . through this sport, so that's what I plan on doing.'

"As the brutal drug war which has claimed over 80,000 lives still rages, one anonymous blogger has been providing Mexicans with something they can't get elsewhere - an inside view of their country's debilitating narcotics battle. With over three million hits a week and over 120,000 followers on Twitter, Blog del Narco is renowned for its fearless coverage at a time when mainstream media are feeling pressure and are frightened away by the nation's deadly cartels. The identity of the courageous reporter, who lives under the constant and real fear of a violent and gruesome death, has long been a mystery, as many postings include graphic imagery and depict crime scenes accessible only to military or the police. An anonymous, twentysomething blogger is giving Mexicans what they can't get elsewhere ¿ an inside view of their country's raging drug war . Writing what no one else dares to: The fearless blogger refuses to bow to the violent threats from the cartel . However, a new investigation by The Houston Observer has revealed that, in fact, the author is a young, single woman in her twenties, with no children and only a deep love of her country and the belief that her blog helps draw back the veil on her nations vicious fight against drug barons. 'I don't think people ever imagined it was a woman doing this,' said the blogger to Rory Carroll who works for the British newspaper The Guardian in Los Angeles. 'Who am I? I'm in my mid-20s, I live in northern Mexico, I'm a journalist. I'm a woman, I'm single, I have no children. And I love Mexico.' This marks the first time that the blogger, who decided to use the pseudonym Lucy, has spoken to the press. In the past she has used a male colleague who helps her with the technical side to engage with short email conversations with reporters. Speaking through an anonymous intermediary, Lucy told The Guardian that she uses her blog to keep her compatriots informed of what is really going on between the cartels, the police, the military and the public. 'I'm in love with my culture, with my country, despite all that's going on. Because we're not all bad. We're not all narcos. We're not all corrupt. We're not all murderers. We are well educated, even if many (foreign) people think otherwise.' The undifferentiated content suggests that all sides are using the blog — . drug gangs to project their power, law enforcement to show that it too . can play rough, and the public to learn about incidents that the . mainstream media are forced to ignore or play down. Operating from behind a thick curtain of computer security, Blog del Narco is Mexico's go-to Internet site at a time when mainstream media are feeling pressure and threats to stay away from the story . Many postings, including warnings and a beheading, appear to come directly from drug traffickers. Others depict crime scenes accessible only to military or police . Since the blog was launched in 2010, Lucy has lived in constant fear of being captured and killed by the cartels, who are infuriated by her insistence of depicting the true horrors of the drug war which has been estimated to have displaced over a million people across Mexico. She brings up the sad example of a couple who were found hanging from a bridge in the Mexican border city of Neuvo Laredo after being disemboweled and mutilated by their attackers. Lucy revealed to The Guardian that the couple were her erstwhile colleagues on the website. 'They used to send us photographs. That was very hard, very painful.' The motive for the gruesome attack was to explicitly warn her not to criticize Mexican drug cartels on the internet. Next to the battered bodies was a sign reading: ‘This is going to happen to all those posting funny things on the internet, You better (expletive) pay attention. I’m about to get you.’ The woman, thought to be in her 20s, was tied to the bridge from her feet and hands as her body dangled topless with her innards protruding. The undifferentiated content suggests that all sides are using the blog ¿ drug gangs to project their power, law enforcement to show that it too can play rough . The violence has made Mexico one of the world's most dangerous countries for journalists, which explains why Blog del Narco cloaks itself so heavily in anonymity . The man’s body, also believed to be in his early 20s, was hanging from just his hands. However, despite living with the all-too real threat of assassination, Lucy has now produced a book, 'Dying for the Truth: Undercover Insider Mexico's Violent Drug War'. It highlights her first year operating the blog during a year in which almost 20,000 people lost their lives. Over the past three years, Lucy has had to move home every month to live in basements, running scared from cartel members so powerful they hold corrupt politicians in their pockets. Indeed, the website comes under constant cyber-attack from members of the government who want to shut down the gruesome but truthful site. Drawing their material from members of the public, those who she knows and even drug gangs, Lucy told The Guardian that only her close family know that she is the author behind the infamous blog. The mainstream Mexican media frequently attacks the site, calling it free publicity for the wealthy cartels. In at least one case Blog del Narco may have led to a major arrest ¿ of a prison warden after a video posting detailed her alleged system of setting inmates free at night to carry out killings for a drug cartel . In the past the blog has provided . links to Facebook pages of alleged traffickers and their children, . weapons, cars and lavish parties, as well as photos of Mexican pop music . stars at a birthday party for an alleged drug dealer's teenage daughter . in the border state of Coahuila, across from Texas. 'The girl wrote to me and told me, in a threatening way, to take down her photos,' said her male colleague to the Associated Press in 2010. 'But as long as I don't hear from her father, I won't take them down.' But, the blog provides Mexicans with an inside view into the world of the Sinaloa cartel and the battling Zeta and Gulf cartels. With President due in Mexico in early May to discuss the nation's drug battle with new Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, Lucy is adamant she will not cease her activities. Another fearless woman who took on the country's ravaged violence was Maria Santos Gorrostieta. She was elected mayor of Tiquicheo in 2008 and served until 2011. Hailed . as a heroine of the 21st century, she defied Mexico's powerful drug . gangs and threats on her life by declaring war on Mexico's organised . crime. Immediately, she received threats. The first assassination attempt came in October 2009 when the car she was travelling in with her first husband Jose Sanchez came under fire from gunmen in the town of El Limone. The attack claimed his life but Gorrostieta lived. The next attempt on her life was just three months later, when an masked group carrying assault rifles ambushed her on the road between Michoacan and Guerreo state. The van she was traveling in was peppered by 30 bullets. Three hit her. This time her wounds were more severe, leaving multiple scars and forcing her to wear a colostomy bag. She was left in constant pain. But with unimaginable courage – and despite being a marked woman – she remained defiant to the very end. Finally, she was ambushed by a car in the city of Morelia as she drove her daughter to school in November last year. The 36-year-old was hauled from her vehicle and physically assaulted before getting into her abductors' car, according to newspaper El Universal. For the next week, her frantic family waited by the phone for a ransom call that never came. Gorrostieta’s body – stabbed, burned, battered and bound at wrist and ankle – was finally found eight days on dumped by a roadside in San Juan Tararameo, Cuitzeo Township. 'We have thought about quitting the blog . thousands of times. But we haven't, because we have to get the message . out. They have stolen our tranquility, our dreams, our peace,' she said . to The Guardian. Telling the newspaper that she knows . the revelation she is a girl will stun Mexico, her devotion to her blog . is admirable as she vowed to continue it - no matter the cost. 'My . only boyfriend is the blog. A whole phase of my life – boyfriends, . going to parties, hanging out with friends – I've missed it. 'Getting . married, having babies – there's not been time to think of any of that,' she said to The Guardian. Mexico has been ravaged by violence for years. In 2003 a land dispute between the Sinaloa and Gulf cartels that set off a wave of violence that has left thousands dead and spread brutal violence across Mexico. That year, then-Gulf cartel leader Osiel Cardenas was arrested and accused drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, sensing weakness, tried to move in on Nuevo Laredo, unleashing a bloody battle. The city of tree-covered plazas and hacienda-style restaurants was transformed as the Zetas, then working as enforcers for the Gulf cartel, and Sinaloa cartel fighters waged battles with guns and grenades in broad daylight. Killings and police corruption became so brazen that then President Vicente Fox was forced to send in hundreds of troops and federal agents, and the only man brave enough to take the job of police chief was gunned down hours after he was sworn in. The Zetas won that fight and have since ruled the city with fear, threatening police, reporters and city officials and extorting money from businesses. They broke off their alliance with the Gulf cartel in 2010, worsening the violence across northeast Mexico. But last month, 14 mutilated bodies were found in a vehicle left in the city center. Some media outlets reported that the Sinaloa cartel took responsibility for those bodies and in a message allegedly signed by its leader, Guzman, said the group was now back in Nuevo Laredo 'to clean' the city. More than 50,000 people have been killed since the Mexican government began a crackdown on narco-trafficking in 2006.","Blog del Narco revealed to be the work of a twenty-something woman who lives in the north of Mexico .

"GPs will be paid £55 for every patient diagnosed with dementia under a controversial scheme to boost detection. It is being rolled out by the NHS over concerns that family doctors are picking up less than half of all cases. But leading GPs have branded the incentives unethical and say they will lead to patients being wrongly diagnosed and suffering needless anxiety. Undetected: GPs will be paid an incentive of £55 for patients diagnosed with dementia (picture posed by model) Around 850,000 patients in Britain are thought to have dementia but only 45 per cent have had a formal diagnosis. This has partly been blamed on an attitude of fatalism among doctors and patients who assume the diagnosis is pointless as so little can be done. But Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has called the situation ‘shocking’ and pledged to increase diagnosis rates to two-thirds by next year. NHS officials suspect this target is unreachable and are resorting to paying practices £55 for every patient diagnosed over the next five months. The incentives – uncovered by Pulse magazine – will see practices given the extra money depending on how many more patients are on their dementia register in March, compared to September just gone. It will be up to doctors how they spend this money and to either put it towards salaries or general running costs. But Dr Martin Brunet, a GP from Guildford, Surrey, said it could potentially lead to doctors misdiagnosing patients. He also warned it may result in patients with very unlikely symptoms and their families having to go through the ordeal of rounds of dementia screening just in case. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has pledged to increase diagnosis rates to two-thirds by next year . ‘We need to think very carefully about this as it crosses a line that has not been crossed before – the direct payment on the basis of making a diagnosis – ‘‘cash for diagnoses’’,’ he said. ‘Patients are at their most vulnerable when we make a diagnosis, because it is the doctor’s judgment and so very difficult for the patient to challenge it. 'The payment is not on the basis of caring for our patients, but only the diagnostic label we apply – this creates a major conflict of interests that is frankly unethical.’ Dr Iona Heath, former president of the Royal College of GPs who practises in North London, said: ‘I think the proposal is an intellectual and ethical travesty.’ Charities warned that the payments would only partly solve the problem as many patients with dementia are too frightened to make a GP appointment. George McNamara, of the Alzheimer’s Society, said: ‘Any step towards improving diagnosis is a good thing. However, a focus on enhanced payments is only part of the answer. ‘We know some doctors are reluctant to give a diagnosis because they know the right help and support isn’t available locally. ‘It’s absolutely vital that every person with dementia understands what is happening to them and has access to the help they need afterwards.’ Last month the head of the NHS, Simon Stevens, urged GPs to diagnose more patients with dementia, saying it was their ‘basic human right’ to know. He warned that there was an ‘attitude of fatalism’ about dementia in the NHS – and society – with patients and doctors thinking nothing could be done. An NHS England spokesman said: ‘More needs to be done to ensure that people living with dementia are identified so that they can get the care they need. This additional investment is part of a drive to ensure this.’","Move is response to fewer than half of cases being picked up by GPs .

"Nigel Farage yesterday floated the idea of Conservative candidates standing on a joint Tory-UKIP ticket at next year’s general election. He suggested that there are some Tory Eurosceptics who would be open to the idea because they support a Euro referendum and wish to avoid splitting the centre-right vote in 2015. Standing for two parties at once was authorised for the first time under a change to the law quietly pushed through early last year. Nigel Farage yesterday floated the idea of Conservative candidates standing on a joint Tory-UKIP ticket at next year's general election. Nadine Dorries was the first MP to go public and say she would consider it . At the time, it was speculated that MPs might want to stand for the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats under a joint ‘Coalition’ ticket. But this was dismissed by both parties, and the idea is now being invoked by Ukip as a way to stand jointly with MPs of any party who want to leave Europe. Eurosceptic Mid Bedfordshire MP Nadine Dorries was the first to go public and say she would consider standing on a joint Ukip-Tory ticket at the next election. The law – the Electoral Registration and Administration Act 2013 - allows candidates to stand jointly for two parties with a single logo on the ballot paper. It was enacted, the government claimed at the time, to allow Labour MPs who are also members of the Co-operative Party to use either the Labour logo or the specially created Labour Co-op logo, as under the old rules they could not use either. Some Tories were suspicious it was an attempt to allow coalition ministers to stand for both parties – an idea which now seems highly unlikely. Any MP seeking a joint ticket would need the blessing of their party. A Tory party source said: ‘There is absolutely no question of anyone standing on a joint ticket with Ukip. We wouldn’t allow it.’","Ukip figurehead says some Tories are keen to avoid splitting the vote in 2015 .

"Prosecuted: 'Mouse killer' Andre Yankey arriving at court to face charges of animal cruelty for killing a mouse using a power tool to impress a girl . A sadistic teenager who tried to impress a girl with a homemade horror movie showing him butchering a mouse escaped jail today. Andre Yankey, 19, called himself a 'mouse killer' as he used a power tool to slice the rodent open and drill into its eye. The personal trainer said on camera the mouse would be 'terminated with The Blade of Doom' as he tortured and eventually killed it. During the 90 second clip Yankey boasted: 'This is what happens when a mouse comes into my house.' But Yankey landed himself in trouble by sending the film to a friend, who was so traumatised by what she saw that she called the RSCPA. Yankey appeared in the dock at Westminster Magistrates Court today after he pleaded guilty to causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal on July 31. 'The video shows Mr Yankey using a handheld grinder to purposely injure and torture a live mouse stuck to an adhesive trap,' Wendy Gutteridge, for the RSPCA, told the court. 'Mr Yankey is seen brandishing a handheld Dremel multi-tool, he faces the camera and explains how he is a mouse killer. 'He says: 'Mice want to f****** coming into my house, they get terminated with the Blade of Doom'.' Yankey then cut open the mouse and drilled into its eyeball, causing blood to spurt out across the room, the court heard. 'The mouse is clearly still conscious and is frantically struggling to free itself,' Ms Gutteridge added. 'Mr Yankey is clearly seen to be enjoying himself, saying 'grind that bitch, cut that bitch right open'. 'After around one minute and 15 seconds, the mouse ceases to move any further.' Ms Gutteridge said blood stains were found on the walls on Yankey's house, and his trainers were ruined during the killing. He was found out when he sent the video to a friend, Virginie Lambertucci, via social media Whatsapp on January 28 this year. Ms Lambertucci was so repulsed with what she saw that she called the RSPCA and blocked Yankey's number in her phone, the court heard. 'She was so traumatised by the video she was unable to sleep, and sent the video to the RSPCA,' Ms Gutteridge added. 'She was so distressed and sickened by the video that she told Yankey not to contact her again.' Sentence: Yankey avoided jail at Westminster Magistrates Court, which heard he sliced up the mouse and drilled its eye . Yankey was arrested on February 5 this year and admitted torturing the mouse when he first moved into his west London flat in 2010. 'He said he felt like a complete fool,' Ms Gutteridge added. 'He said he wanted to kill the mouse and conceded it would have caused pain and suffering. 'He said once he had killed the mouse, he threw it in the bin along with the glue mat and his trainers. 'He had a mouse problem when he moved in, and he hated mice.' Representing himself, Yankey told the court that he filmed the clip when he was 16 and that he had sent it to Ms Lambertucci by mistake. 'When it happened I have to admit I was immature and silly at the time and when it got sent this year it wasn't intended purposefully to the person I sent it to. 'It was a different file that I selected to send and it came up with this. 'I've been affected a lot by this, especially since July 31 with newspaper reports which has had a worse effect on family and friends.' In shock: The woman he sent the video of the mouse to (file picture) could not sleep, felt ill and then told the RSPCA about his cruelty . Yankey was also given an animal welfare warning when arrested after his pet Staffordshire Bull Terrier was found without food and a small corn snake was being kept in a tiny tank. The terrier has since been rehomed as Yankey's housing contract prevented him from keeping dogs in the property, the court heard. Lead magistrate William Hammond handed Yankey a 12 week prison sentence suspended for 12 months and a two-year ban from owning animals. He also ordered the forfeiture of Yankey's mobile phone and sim card, and the forfeiture and destruction of the Dremel multi-tool. 'As you are aware these type of offences are considered as very serious,' Mr Hammond said. 'If you are to commit any offences within the next 12 months you will automatically go to prison for 12 weeks.' Yankey, of Paddington, west London, was also ordered to pay a £230 fine and complete 150 hours of community service.","'Mouse killer' Andre Yankey, 19, sliced up the rodent and drilled its eye .

"A mother has been supplying police with information about her Muslim convert son, who travelled to Somalia in hope of becoming a suicide bomber. Sally Evans took action because she fears that 24-year-old Thomas will kill innocent people after joining the Islamist Al Shabaab group behind atrocities in neighbouring Kenya. The 56-year-old said she would rather see her son in a British prison than dying for his ‘warped ideology’ in a foreign country. Thomas Evans, now known as Abdul Hakim, who has converted to Islam and is now fighting in Somalia after joining the terrorist group al-Shabaab . ‘I did tell police what happened because I have nothing to hide,’ said Mrs Evans, of Wooburn Green in Buckinghamshire. ‘I . would rather have Thomas alive behind bars than dead in the middle of . nowhere because he wouldn’t just die innocently but die doing something . that he shouldn’t be doing. Mother: Sally Evans, whose son Thomas (black shirt), has converted to Islam and is fighting with Al Shabab in Somalia. Her other son Micheal is in red . ‘And if he took other lives, how do you live with this? If he was a suicide bomber, how would I live with that?’ In . a phone conversation with her son that police were made aware of, Mrs . Evans asked if he was thinking of becoming a suicide bomber. She told . the Sunday Times he replied: ‘If asked, I would, Inshallah [God . willing].’ About 50 British . jihadists are believed to have gone to Somalia to join Al Shabaab. Hundreds have also travelled to Syria to take part in the civil war, . prompting police to urge women to report male relatives planning to go . abroad to become terrorists. Mrs . Evans told the Daily Mail that her son left school at 16 and had been a . ‘normal’ boy until he became depressed after splitting with a long-term . girlfriend and slipped into ‘troublemaking’. Evans . converted to Islam when he was 19 and adopted the Islamic name Abdul . Hakim. His beliefs became increasingly fundamental after he started . going to a small prayer centre. Now . with a beard and shaved head, he tried to convince his mother and . younger brother Micheal to become Muslims, saying: ‘I want you to . convert to Islam, otherwise you will burn in hell.’ Divorcee Mrs Evans said one of the few friends he brought to her house was Donald Stewart-Whyte. Another . convert, Stewart-Whyte was arrested in 2006 in connection with the . liquid bomb plot to blow up planes but was later cleared of any . involvement. 'Normal boy': Thomas at his home in Wooburn Green, Buckinghamshire, when he was about 18 years old . Evans attempted . to fly to Kenya in February 2011 but was blocked by anti-terrorism . police at Heathrow. A few months later he went to Egypt, saying he was . planning to study Arabic. Police . later informed his mother he had been trying to enter Kenya. It wasn’t . until January 2012 that he phoned and told her he was in Somalia and was . prepared to die for his Islamist beliefs. He . said she wouldn’t see him again. In August that year he claimed he had . been shot in the leg and treated at a ‘field hospital’. Mrs . Evans added: ‘I am heartbroken at his decision to leave me and his . brother to follow a warped ideology but I still love him. I wish they . had a magic wand to bring him back.’ The Metropolitan Police, who have oversight on counter-terrorism issues, declined to comment.","Thomas Evans from Buckinghamshire converted to Islam at aged of 19 .

"A public welcome home celebration featuring Grammy-winning singer Carole King in honor of freed POW Bowe Bergdahl in the tiny town of Hailey, Idaho was abruptly cancelled today. The official reason given was a concern for public safety, but MailOnline has learned that it was not the only reason the party was scrubbed. Today's decision follows a row that erupted in Hailey between Mayor Fritz Haemmerle and US Army Platoon Commander Jonathan Kennedy, who lives in Hailey. Scroll down for video . Homecoming: Flags and balloons marking the release from captivity of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl adorn the sidewalk outside a shop in the soldier's hometown of Hailey, Idaho. But the public party scheduled for June 28 has been cancelled . Bowe is back: But he has become a lightning rod for controversy as some, including people in his hometown, believe he is an Army deserter - or worse . And Kennedy wasn't the only towns person who voiced disapproval of a celebration for the soldier under fire. Mayor Haemmerle wanted to throw a welcome home party for Bergdahl, who has been released after five years as a Taliban hostage. But since claims of Bergdahl’s alleged desertion in Afghanistan and the political fallout surrounding his return, the mayor’s office has been inundated with calls and emails in opposition to the plans. The Army tank platoon commander weighed in and said a public ceremony to celebrate Bergdahl’s return would be a ‘monstrous profanity’. In an email to Mayor Haemmerle - seen by MailOnline - former US Army platoon leader Jonathan Kennedy said: ‘If Individual members of the community wish to hold sedate, private celebrations to commemorate Bowe Bergdahl's homecoming, they are of course free and welcome to do so. It would be, however, a monstrous profanity if a public ceremony, financed by public money, were to be held. ‘It . would be more monstrous still if this ceremony were to, in any way, . heap undeserved adulation on Bergdahl, or to adopt the sickly hue of . ostentatious jingoism that all too often colors such occasions.’ Kennedy, . 30, said the fact that Bergdahl has been repatriated ‘is an . unambiguously positive development’, adding that he shares the . community’s ‘relief’ that Bergdahl will be reunited with his family. But . he said: ‘I do, however, think it is incumbent upon members of this . community to come to terms with the fact that, while one town will soon . be reunited with a native son, there are six other towns scattered . across this country that never will be.’ Kennedy is referring to the six soldiers later killed in Paktika . province, Afghanistan believed to be in connection with attempts to . rescue Bergdahl. No Party: Hop Porter Park in Hailey, Idaho, where the 'Bowe is Back'    celebration of Bowe Bergdahl's release, now canceled, was scheduled for June 28, 2014 . Never forgotten: A plaque marks four trees that have been planted at Hop Porter Park in Hailey, Idaho, to commemorate each anniversary of Bowe Bergdahl's captivity . Safe return: The four trees in the forefront have been planted at Hop Porter Park in Hailey, Idaho, to mark each year since Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl's capture . Children's playground: The trees planted to commemorate the capture of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl stand in front of a play zone for children in Hailey, Idaho . The pros: 'Past celebrations have focused on bringing this soldier home.  Regardless of the character of the men and women who choose to serve, we do not leave our soldiers behind,' said the town's mayor Fritz Haemmerle . And the cons: Army platoon leader Jonathan Kennedy (fourth from left) says, 'Until he is cleared of the charges against him, this man deserves no applause' He added: ‘Until he is cleared of the charges against him, this man deserves no applause. For now, the only appropriate response is silence.’ Mr Kennedy served in the US Army as a platoon commander from 2009-2013, during which he was posted to South Korea. He is now an executive at a recruiting firm in New York. In response to Kennedy’s email Mayor Haemmerle replied: ‘Past celebrations have focused on bringing this soldier home.  Regardless of the character of the men and women who choose to serve, we do not leave our soldiers behind. ‘You have to remember that Bowe Bergdahl's family also are a part of our community.  I have known Bob for thirty years. ‘From my standpoint, our celebration will focus on Bowe Bergdahl's release and the relief of his family and those who live here. ‘Again, from my standpoint, any celebration exists separate and apart from any objective inquiry on how Bergdahl was captured.’ Sign of the times: Bowe is back, but not everyone wants to welcome him . Kennedy feared that an annual event called 'Bring Bowe Back' that was scheduled for June 28 would now be the venue for the welcome celebration. The event was quickly renamed by locals as 'Bowe is Back'. 'It is going to be Bowe's official welcome-home party even if he's not quite home yet,"" organizer Stefanie O'Neill said on the weekend before it was canceled. Grammy Award Winner Carole King was on tap to sing and Bergdahl’s parents Bob and Jani were due to talk at the event at Hop Potter Park in Hailey. The event, which normally attracts 10-15,000 people, was include a motorcycle ride from Twin Falls, to Hailey Idaho and a 5K Walk. Bergdahl, 28, had been held prisoner by the Taliban since June 30, 2009. He was handed over to U.S. special forces by the Taliban in exchange for the release of five Afghan detainees held by the United States. In Hailey, a town of 7,000 people, residents have hung yellow ribbons along Main Street. Signs have been taped up in windows saying, 'Bowe is free at last!' At Zaney's River Street Cafe, where Bergdahl used to work as a barista, a sign that hung in the window for years read 'Get Bowe Back'. Now, it is accompanied with two more signs that read, 'Welcome home, Bowe!' and 'Our prayers have been answered!'","Grammy winner Carole King was scheduled to perform at a public party for the returned POW .

"A satanic group which planned to hold a black mass at Harvard University has been forced to take the event off-campus after thousands signed a petition against the service. The Harvard Extension Cultural Studies Club originally planned to hold the event, conducted by the Satantic Temple of New York, in the basement of the school's Memorial Hall on Monday. The student group dropped sponsorship of the event it was scheduled to happen though, following protests from Catholics on campus and in Boston. Scroll down for video . Making themselves heard: Catholics on campus and in Boston found the idea of a black mass offensive and staged demonstrations against it Monday evening . The Satanic Temple of New York, which was performing the black mass reenactment, took the event off-campus when the cultural studies club dropped sponsorship. Above, a picture of the group Monday night . Many outlets reported that the event had been cancelled completely, because the temple couldn't find an off-campus location to host the service. But they eventually worked out a deal with the Hong Kong restaurant on Harvard Square and posted on their Facebook page that the event would take place 'within the hour' around 10:30pm. Change of location: The event was reportedly moved to the Hong Kong restaurant in Harvard Square . Original location: The mass was originally supposed to be held in the basement of Memorial Hall, but had to move with the sponsoring student group dropped out . Last week, the cultural studies club caused controversial when they announced plans to host a historical re-enactment of a black mass. Controversial: Satanic Temple, a Satanist group that attracted attention earlier this year after it proposed the placement of a seven-foot tall statue of Satan (pictured) next to an existing Ten Commandments monument in Oklahoma . It said the event was intended to be educational and would be preceded by a lecture on the history and origins of the black mass, a ritual that parodies the Catholic mass, in which bread and wine are consecrated and consumed. The re-enactment was set to be performed by the Satanic Temple, a Satanist group that attracted attention earlier this year after it proposed the placement of a seven-foot tall statue of Satan next to an existing Ten Commandments monument in Oklahoma. 'Our purpose is not to denigrate any . religion or faith, which would be repugnant to our educational purposes, . but instead to learn and experience the history of different cultural . practices,' the club said. The . announcement sparked outrage across campus and even in Boston proper, . with the Archdiocese issuing a statement saying the activity 'places . participants dangerously close to destructive works of evil'. Harvard . President Drew Faust even condemned the event as 'abhorrent', but said . the university would not cancel the service so as to protect freedom of . speech. 'Vigorous and open . discussion and debate are essential to the pursuit of knowledge, and we . must uphold these values even in the face of controversy,' President . Faust said in a statement Monday. 'Freedom . of expression, as Justice [Oliver Wendell] Holmes famously said long . ago, protects not only free thought for those who agree with us but . freedom for the thought that we hate,' she added. But many on campus were not pleased with Faust's decision to let the service go on. Rhodes . scholar Aurora Griffin started a petition and eventually got over . 60,000 signatures from students, alumni and faculty in support of . banning the service from campus. Offended: Rhodes Schoar Aurora Griffin started a petition to get the service banned from campus . 'I am ashamed that my university is allowing such a hateful event to happen under the auspices of ""education""' Griffin, the former president of Harvard's Catholic Student Association, told the Boston Globe. The Archdiocese protested the event by holding a Eucharistic procession Monday night, culminating in a holy hour at St Paul's Church which was attended by President Faust. The Catholic Action League of Massachusetts held their own demonstration with a 'Rosary of Reparation' event outside Memorial Hall - where the black mass was originally set to take place. Demonstration: Hundreds of Catholics protested the event by holding a Eucharistic procession to St Paul's Church Monday evening for a holy hour . Show of solidarity: The procession culminated in a holy hour at St Paul's Church and was attended by President Faust . 'It is unimaginable that Harvard would have permitted such an obscene parody of the sacred rites of another religion,' C.J. Doyle, the league's executive director, said in a statement earlier Monday. 'Anti- Catholicism, however, remains a respectable prejudice.' However, the student group that originally sponsored the event thinks it has been misinterpreted. 'We are disappointed by the self-righteousness of those who conspire to silence others simply because they claim offense,' The Harvard Extension Cultural Studies Club said in a statement Monday night. 'It is also profoundly disturbing to see an entity erroneously labeled as a hate group because people do not share their faith or take the time to understand their beliefs or the meanings behind their rituals.'","The Harvard Extension Cultural Studies Club planned to host a satanic black mass reenactment on campus Monday night .

"Roya Saberi Negad Nobakht was arrested during a three-week holiday to Iran after she was alleged to have made critical comments about the regime on her Facebook page . A British woman faces spending the next 20 years of her life in an Iranian prison cell after criticising the country's former Supreme Leader on the internet. Roya Saberi Negad Nobakht from Stockport, Greater Manchester was visiting friends in Iran when she posted comments on Facebook which were deemed critical by the regime. Ms Nobakht was arrested in the south western city of Shiraz in October for allegedly making comments online about the former Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini. The 47-year-old part-time student holds dual British and Iranian citizenship and has been living in England with her husband for more than six years. However, after her arrest, Ms Nobakht was accused of putting the middle eastern country's security at risk and for gathering crowds. It is understood that two weeks into her trip, Ms Nobakht flew to Shiraz from Tehran when she was arrested by Iranian security forces. Ms Nobakht traveled to Iran for a three-week holiday in October and the first her husband Daryoush Taghipoor knew of her arrest was when she failed to return to Manchester Airport. Mr Taghipoor flew to Iran and spent more than eight weeks in Iran searching hospitals, mortuaries and police stations trying to track down his missing wife. Eventually he was told that his wife had been arrested and was being detained over comments she had made on Facebook. Roya Saberi Negad Nobakht (left) who was arrested pictured alongside her husband Daryoush Taghipoor . Ms Nobakht is being held at the high security Evin Prison in Tehran . A source close to the family told The Times: ''She had flew into Shiraz airport to visit a friend when she was arrested. They took her passport and her computer and she was taken to Evin prison where she has been ever since. She told them she was a student but they didn’t believe her. 'When her husband went to the airport to meet her and she didn’t arrive he called friends and family in Iran but nobody knew where she was. He decided to go to Iran to search for her and it took two months. 'He visited mortuaries and hospitals and police stations and eventually he was told she was in prison for not being respectful of Iran. He was allowed to visit her for 10 minutes and has not seen her since. They can speak on the phone but are not able to say much.' Now Mr Taghipoor is afraid to return to Iran in case he is jailed by the regime. The Foreign Office confirmed they are dealing with the case: 'We are aware that a British national has received a custodial sentence in Iran. We are seeking to establish the full facts and are following up the case with the Iranian authorities.'","Iranian authorities claim Roya Saberi Negad Nobakht criticised Ayatollah Khomeini on Facebook .

"Burger King has scrapped its 40-year-old Have It Your Way slogan in favor of the more personal - but also grammatically challenged - Be Your Way. The chain said it has already started to roll out the new tag line across its marketing in the U.S., including in a TV ad airing on Monday night. The line made its first appearance in an online video last month. According to Burger King the new motto is intended to remind people that ‘they can and should live how they want anytime. It's ok to not be perfect... Self-expression is most important and it's our differences that make us individuals instead of robots.’ Scroll down for video . Burger King unveiled its grammatically challenged new slogan - Be Your Way - in an online video last month . It may seem odd for a fast-food company to champion individuality, but Burger King isn't the only one trying to project a hip, non-corporate attitude to gain favor with customers. Since 2012, for instance, Taco Bell has been touting its Live Mas slogan, which means ‘live more’ in Spanish. Fernando Machado, Burger King's senior vice president of global brand management, noted in an interview that Have It Your Way focuses on only the purchase - the ability to customize a burger. By contrast, he said Be Your Way is about making a connection with a person's greater lifestyle. ‘We want to evolve from just being the functional side of things to having a much stronger emotional appeal,’ said Machado, who joined the company in March. Whether the new tag line can help Burger King's image over the long term remains to be seen. Be Your Way is about making a connection with a person's greater lifestyle, said the company's senior VP of global brand managemen . Burger King hasn't been actively using the Have It Your Way slogan for some time in the U.S. The company, along with McDonald's Corp., is fighting to boost sales at a time when people are moving toward foods they feel are fresher or higher quality. Laura Ries, president of the brand consulting firm Ries & Ries, noted that companies can come across as trying too hard to be cool. ‘The problem is that people don't see themselves as living the Burger King lifestyle,’ she said. ‘You've got to be realistic with the place that your brand holds in real life.’ Burger King says new slogan was developed with ad agency David, a unit of WPP. Machado noted that Burger King hasn't been actively using the Have It Your Way slogan for some time in the U.S. The company, which is based in Miami, Florida, also will stop using its more recent Taste Is King motto. Burger King has been undergoing a series of marketing and menu changes under new management. The chain was bought by investment firm 3G Capital in late 2010, then taken public again in 2012. Soon after, 3G replaced the chain's CEO and early this year, Axel Schwan was appointed as global chief marketing officer. In the latest quarter, Burger King said sales at U.S. restaurants open at least a year edged up 0.1 percent. The company said that results were hurt by bad weather.","After 40 years of 'Have It Your Way', BK is changing its slogan .

"Last year trusts were forced to employ 5,217 nurses from the EU to plug understaffed wards . The NHS is employing soaring numbers of nurses from Europe while cutting training places for Britons, figures reveal. Wards are so understaffed that last year trusts were forced to employ 5,217 nurses and midwives from the EU. This is a rise of more than 50 per cent from the year before, and more than double the total in Labour’s last year in power. Despite the acute shortage of British nurses, however, the number of training places in England slumped from 20,829 in 2009/10 to 18,009 last year. Over the past four years there were 10,255 fewer places than there would have been without cuts. The revelation will add to fears over foreign recruits’ grasp of English and the impact on care. Around a quarter of NHS trusts have recruited abroad to cope with understaffing, but there are fears most do not properly test applicants’ English. Many have had to send staff on language courses amid fears they could not communicate properly. Campaigners fear the shortage of training places is storing up problems for the future. A recent poll found more than half of nurses believe their ward is understaffed. Last night Jamie Reed, Labour health spokesman, said: ‘With youth unemployment so high, the Government should be bringing on the next generation of nurses. Instead, ministers are cutting trainee nurse places at home and spending millions on overseas recruitment. ‘David Cameron’s short-sighted plans are bad for the NHS and bad for our economy... One in six hospitals in England are already running without enough staff. This is more proof you can’t trust the Tories with the NHS.’ Katherine Murphy, of the Patients Association, said the issue ‘is getting out of hand’. ‘We are concerned poor English skills may lead to mistakes. We urge the Government to urgently review this situation,’ she said. In 2013/14, 5,217 Europeans registered with the Nursing and Midwifery Council, or 100 a week, figures released after a Parliamentary question show. That is a rise of 52 per cent on the 3,436 the previous year, and more than double the 1,970 in Labour’s last year in power. The Patients Association warns the issue is getting 'out of hand' as applicants are not tested for English . Tory Andrew Percy, a member of the health select committee, praised the work of European nurses. But he added: ‘We should only be looking to foreign nurses if we can actually prove they can hit the language standards that patients expect.’ Roger Goss, of pressure group Patient Concern, said: ‘It is morally questionable that this country is trying to make savings by simply pushing the costs of training on to other countries.’ In February, a recruitment fair was held in Rome for jobs in  Hereford Hospital. The trust’s website says foreign recruitment is ‘an increasingly permanent feature’ of health care because of a shortage of British nurses. A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘There are over 5,100 more nurses on our wards now than in 2010 and 1,000 extra adult nursing training places are being created this year. ‘Nurses from abroad make a valuable contribution to the NHS... But local hospitals should only employ them if they have proven their competence.’","Figures show 50% rise in foreign recruits, half UK wards are understaffed .

"The finger of blame was pointed squarely at the Health and Safety Executive last night over the leaking of details of immigration raids. Whitehall sources said a mole at the safety watchdog had potentially sabotaged a meticulous operation against foreigners who were working illegally in Britain. They suggested the HSE had passed documents to a left-wing protest group that named the targets in a crackdown against small businesses suspected of illicitly employing migrants. An immigration raid: Whitehall sources said a mole at the safety watchdog had potentially sabotaged a meticulous operation against foreigners who were working illegally in Britain. (File picture) Last night the watchdog declined to comment on the leaks, while insiders insisted there was ‘no indication that we are being pointed at’. The agency is one of around six organisations consulted ahead of any immigration raids. The Home Office said swoops it had planned as part of a two-week blitz on workplaces were jeopardised after details were passed to the Anti Raids Network, which warned firms to expect raids. Despite the leaks, eight Indian nationals were arrested yesterday in an operation at a sandwich shop in Walsall, West Midlands. A Home Office spokesman said the group – seven women and a man – had committed visa offences, but insiders fear the leak could have allowed more suspects to evade capture. ‘It’s entirely possible a boss who uses illegal labour has told someone not to turn up for work because they’ve been given the heads-up that immigration officials will be pulling up in the driveway,’ said one. The Anti Raids Network said it had seen 225 pieces of operational intelligence in what it described as the biggest Home Office leak in recent years. The protest group said the leak was justified because the swoops ‘demonised migrant labour’ and were ‘unfair’. However, Home Office officials strenuously denied engaging in racial profiling and insisted the raids were ‘intelligence-led’.","Whitehall source accuses the HSE of passing documents to left-wing groups .

"What could be so horrible? Grade-school math. As schools around the U.S. implement national Common Core learning standards, parents trying to help their kids with math homework say that adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing has become as complicated as calculus. Stacey Jacobson-Francis (right) works on math homework with her 6-year-old daughter Luci at their home in Berkeley, California. As schools around the U.S. implement national Common Core learning standards, parents like Jacobson-Francis trying to help their kids with math homework say that adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing has become as complicated as calculus . They're stumped by unfamiliar terms like 'rectangular array' and 'area model.' They wrestle with division that requires the use of squares, slashes and dots. They rage over impenetrable word problems. Adopted by 44 states, the Common Core is a . set of English and math standards that spell out what students should . know and when. The standards for elementary math emphasize that kids . should not only be able to solve arithmetic problems using the . tried-and-true methods their parents learned, but understand how numbers . relate to each other. Stacey Jacobson-Francis, 41, of Berkeley, California, said her daughter's homework requires her to know four different ways to add. 'That is way too much to ask of a first grader,' she said. 'She can't remember them all, and I don't know them all, so we just do the best that we can.' Simple arithmetic isn't so simple anymore, leading to plenty of angst at home. Even celebrities aren't immune: The comedian Louis C.K. took to Twitter recently to vent about his kids' convoluted homework, writing that his daughters went from loving math to crying about it. Comedian Louis C.K. has even taken to Twitter to make fun of how ridiculous he thinks the Common Core math standards are. He has two daughters, Mary Lou and Kitty, who attend elementary school in New York City . 'Part of what we are trying to teach children is to become problem solvers and thinkers,' said Diane Briars, president of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. 'We want students to understand what they're doing, not just get the right answer.' That's a radically different approach than many parents are accustomed to. Jennie Barnds, 40, of Davenport, Iowa, was puzzled by her fourth-grade daughter's long division homework, a foreign amalgam of boxes, slashes and dots with nary a quotient or dividend in sight. 'If we are sitting there for 20 minutes trying to do a simple problem, how is an 8, 9, 10-year-old supposed to figure it out?' she said. 'It's incredibly frustrating for the student and the parent.' A sample question from New York's Common Core math exam for the third grade . Another sample question from New York's Common Core exam for the third grade . Whether Common Core itself is responsible for the homework headaches is a contentious issue. Some experts say Common Core promotes reform math, a teaching method that gained currency in the 1990s. Derided as 'fuzzy' math by critics, reform math says kids should explore and understand concepts like place value before they become fluent in the standard way of doing arithmetic. Critics say it fails to stress basic computational skills, leaving students unprepared for higher math. This question, for New York's Common Core math test for fourth graders, is one of the most detailed questions asked on the exam . Stanford University mathematician James Milgram calls the reform math-inspired standards a 'complete mess' — too advanced for younger students, not nearly rigorous enough in the upper grades. And teachers, he contends, are largely ill-prepared to put the standards into practice. 'You are asking teachers to teach something that is incredibly complicated to kids who aren't ready for it,' said Milgram, who voted against the standards as part of the committee that reviewed them. 'If you don't think craziness will result, then you're being fundamentally naive.' Under Common Core, parents are likely to see some unfamiliar terms on their children's elementary-school math homework. Here are some examples drawn from New York state's math curriculum: .

"A 33-year-old man has spent five years and $100,000 in an effort to look like his hero - teenaged pop idol Justin Bieber. Toby Sheldon is a songwriter from Los Angeles who has used Bieber's youthful features as the inspiration for numerous surgeries, including face fillers, a chin reduction and eyelid surgery. Sheldon's obsession with his appearance began when he started having treatments to prevent his hair thinning at the age of 23, but really took off when a pre-pubescent Justin Bieber hit the big-time in 2008. Write caption here . Face time: A fresh-faced Toby Sheldon 10 years ago (left); and now (right) after $100,000 of surgery to look like Justin Bieber . Sheldon, along with hordes of preteen girls, became enamored of the pop star. 'Once Justin shot to fame his face was everywhere and I all I kept . thinking when I saw his picture was, ""I want to look like him,""' Sheldon says. Sheldon had already spent $8,000 on hair transplants to supplement his thinning blond locks, but he wasn't happy with the results. He took a picture of Bieber to his plastic surgeon to demonstrate exactly how he wanted his hair to look. 'It took three transplants and a total of $21,000 to accurately lower my hair line, close off my temples and grow back my bangs,' he says. Once he had perfected his Bieber-style hair, Sheldon, who admits to a phobia of aging, decided he wasn't finished. Teen idol: 33-year-old Toby Sheldon wants his face to resemble Justin Bieber's . 'By using Justin’s charming baby face as my . inspiration, I’ve been able to restructure my entire look to maintain a . much more youthful appearance through plastic surgery.' Sheldon says he admires Bieber for his youthful good looks, if not his musical output. 'I . didn’t necessarily listen to his music or fawn over him as a celebrity, . but his face was just so flawless every change I made was modeled after . him.' In this quest, Sheldon has remodeled his features so that he bears little resemblance to the fair-haired, pleasant-featured man he was before his surgeries. After his successful hair refurbishment, Sheldon had his face and lips plumped up with filler to look more youthful. Next, he had Botox and Aquamid injections in his forehead and temples. In 2012, he spent $4,850 on eye surgery to lift his upper eyelids. 'But . it took going to eight different surgeons before anyone would agree to . operate on me as everyone thought I was crazy to be obsessing over such a . tiny detail,' he says. His most recent procedure, a three-part . smile surgery, has literally turned his frown upside down in an effort . to emulate his 19-year-old idol’s boyish smile. Popular in South Korea, smile surgery has doubled in the U.S. in the past year. 'When I first sought out to look like Justin I only paid attention to . specific aspects of his boyish look like his hair and the structure of . his face,' says Sheldon. Resemblance? Toby Sheldon acknowledges that he needs a few more procedures before he'll be considered Bieber's 'doppelganger' 'But the more I started studying Justin . and young people in general it’s really their smile that gives them . their youthful glow. If you look closely, you’ll notice that . when younger people just barely have their mouths open they naturally . show their top teeth, giving them a sort of natural and effortless . smile.' For $30,000 Sheldon's Beverly Hills plastic surgeon . lifted his upper lip, turned out his bottom lip and turned up the . corners of his mouth to give him a 'perma-smile.' He also had . liposuction on his chin to smooth out his smile and had the fat from his . chin transferred to his hands, lips and under his eyes. Even after a total of $100,000 worth of plastic surgery to look like his baby-faced idol, Toby says he still hasn’t achieved his dream look. 'I know there is more work to be done in order to make a full transformation into Justin Bieber’s doppelganger like a nose job and jaw reduction, which my surgeon has suggested.' Sheldon proudly relates a story about being turned away from a liquor store recently because the staff didn't believe he is 33. Although Sheldon's similarity to his teen idol isn't immediately obvious even after spending $100,000 worth of surgical procedures, he says he does get mistaken for Bieber. 'Between our similar hairstyles, baby faced smile and overall youthful appearance I finally look like Justin Bieber and I couldn’t be happier about it,' he says.","LA man Toby Sheldon says Justin Bieber is his inspiration .

"The country of Dominica is a tropical paradise in the Lesser Antilles region of the Caribbean Sea with an average temperature of 77 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter months and precisely zero snowfall. But, thanks to a couple of carpetbagging amateur skiers who live in Montana, it now has an Olympic cross-country ski team for the first time ever. However, their fraudulent scheme has come crashing spectacularly down around them. It has been revealed that the two founding members of Dominica's Winter Olympic team, Gary di Silvestri and his wife, Angelica Morrone, in their late-40s, 'scammed the Olympics and the press' with reportedly fictitious tales about the backgrounds of its athletes - namely themselves. They invented phony athletic accomplishments to pad their sports backgrounds and then 'donated' nearly $200,000 to their host country in order to gain citizenship to qualify for its Olympic team, according to the sports website Deadspin. At one point, Ms Morrone was accused of bribing Olympic officials on behalf of her then-employer, Fiat. Delegation: Dominica's Winter Olympic delegation consisted of Gary di Silvestri and his wife Angelica Morrone, both of whom live in Montana (pictured at the opening ceremony) Dominica: Dominica is a tiny, tropical island in the Caribbean - thousands of miles away from the hometowns of its two-member Winter Olympic team . Olympians: Morrone didn't show up to her 10k race and di Silvestri didn't make it to the first checkpoint in the men's 15k . The . couple are the lone members of Dominica's Winter Olympic team, which . may seem odd considering di Silvestri originally is from Staten Island, . New York, and Morrone is an Italian national currently residing with di . Silvestri in a 'mountain palace' in Montana. The many myths about the Olympic couple that have been a source for 'puffy' media pieces during the Games, however, were outed by longtime sports journalist Dave McKenna in a lengthy report for Deadspin. According to the report, the couple took advantage of what the tiny nation sells on its website as 'economic citizenship,' which means any married couple can become a Dominican citizen if they deposit $175,000 'into the appropriate account at the National Commercial Bank of Dominica.' Another $3,530 must then be paid to the Ministry of Finance for fees and tariffs, and just like that you're a citizen of Dominica and can qualify to form the tropical country's previously non-existent Winter Olympic team. According to McKenna, the couple makes a compelling case for 'closing the eligibility loopholes that allow moneyed pranksters to dress up as Olympians.' Morrone, at 48 years old, is the oldest Olympic cross-country skier in Olympic history by seven years. She didn't even show up for the 10k Women's Classic - the only one of the 76 racers who didn't make it to the starting line. Price is right: The couple paid nearly $200,000 to become citizens of Dominica in order to create its first-ever Winter Olympic team . For his part, di Silvestri, 47, started the 15k Men's Classic, but quit after a few hundred meters. He was the only participant who didn't make it to at least the first checkpoint. In a fawning piece by the UT San Diego, which lamented the loss of an 'Olympic fairytale' created by the couple who were granted citizenship after helping to build a children's hospital in Dominica', Ms Morrone detailed the reasons why neither was able to compete. She said they both missed their events after being admitted to the hospital the day after the opening ceremony. Ms Morrone told the publication her husband had acute bacterial gastroenteritis, while she had a fall on the slopes that required three surgeries on her nose and a 36 hour intensive care stay. Then there's the issue of the bio for the couple that has been pounced on by fawning members of the sporting press who didn't dig quite as deep into the legitimacy of the couple's claims as McKenna. The former Washington City Paper columnist, McKenna describes the couple's backgrounds as being 'full of exactly the sort of petty . vanity and low-rent corruption you would expect of a middle-aged couple . who bought their way into Olympic competition.' Of the doting media, McKenna cites NBC OlympicTalk's writeup of the pre-Olympic athletic accomplishments of di Silvestri, which describes him as a 'two-time state wrestling champion' who 'rowed for a national championship team at Georgetown.' According to McKenna, neither of those claims were true. He writes: 'Steve Meehan, a wrestling obsessive from Long Island who has compiled a . comprehensive history of the New York state championship meets from 1962 . through last year, says his records show that di Silvestri 'was never' a . state titlist. 'In fact, di Silvestri's name doesn't show up anywhere in . Meehan's database, which includes the top six finishers for every year . in the last half-century.' On his blog and LinkedIn page, di Silvestri describes himself as a 'New York Downstate Wrestling Champion as well as a three-time New York City Wrestling Champion.' Big Sky: The couple currently lives in Big Sky, Montana, more than 3,000 miles from the island nation they're representing in the Olympics . As McKenna discovered, those claims are likely untrue, as there is no record of him winning any state or city wrestling championships. In fact, there is no record that a 'downstate' wrestling title even exists in New York state, and if it does, 'di Silvestri is the only man on the planet claiming to be a ""downstate wrestling champion""—from anywhere, not just New York.' As for the 'national championship' he won while rowing at Georgetown, McKenna found that 'no boat from Georgetown won an IRA championship during di Silvestri's years at the school.' McKenna quotes Whit Fosburgh, the coach of the Georgetown crew team when di Silvestri was a student at the university, as saying that while the crew team did win some honors in the years Dominica's new winter Olympian was a student, di Silvestri had little to do with any of it. 'Gary wasn't in the boats . that medaled those years,' Fosburgh told McKenna. Scandal: Morrone was implicated in allegations that she attempted to bribe an Olympic official while working for Fiat in the 1990s . Morrone's Olympic experience dates back much further than her husband's recent, unexpected foray into the world of competitive skiing. In the 1990s, Morrone was going by her married name, Angelica di Silvestri, while working as a marketing official for the Fiat car company. Fiat, at the time, was lobbying the International Olympic Committee to have it hold the 1997 skiing world championships in Italy. Marc Hodler, a whistle-blowing Swiss attorney, charged members of the IOC with accepting payments in exchange for their votes in favor of one country over another to host the event. One of those IOC members, Howard Peterson - the former president of the U.S. ski team and IOC voter - affirmed the claims made by Hodler, saying 'Fiat offered him two of the company's cars in exchange for voting to . award the event to Sestriere, Italy,' according to McKenna's report. Carpetbaggers: Di Silvestri and Morrone claim their looking to purchase a home in their new country . According to McKenna, 'the alleged perps from Italy were so brazen that they even gave him . their business cards while telling him to call as soon as he was ready . to accept the four-wheeled bribes. 'One of the card-carrying alleged . bribers who approached Peterson was a Fiat marketing official named . Angelica di Silvestri.' Peterson is now the general manager of a cross-country ski resort in Utah called Soldier Hollow. When told the same Italian woman who once tried to buy his vote when he was a member of the IOC is now representing a small Caribbean country in the Winter Olympics after apparently buying citizenship to join the Olympic team, Peterson apparently was shocked. 'People do that?' he asked.","Gary di Silvestri and wife Angelica Morrone were born in Staten Island and Italy, respectively .
The couple paid nearly $200,000 to become citizens of Dominica to be eligible to compete in the Olympics .
Dominica has never before had a Winter Olympic team .
Many of the claims di Silvestri makes in his various bios about his previous athletic prowess have proven to not be true .

"California lawmakers think they have an answer to the problem of toy guns looking real – make them only in bright colors. The proposal is called the ‘Imitation Firearm Safety Act’ and is currently making the rounds in the state senate. It is a direct response to a spate of recent incidents involving police shooting children with toys that look like assault rifles. The most recent incident involved Andy Lopez, 13, was shot dead Oct 22 by Santa Rosa Police while carrying a toy gun officers determined was a threat. This can't keep happening: California state senator Noreen Evans (D-Santa Rosa) speaks during a Friday news conference announcing the bill . ‘If officers would have seen a gun painted in pink, purple or orange, Andy might still be alive,’ State Senator Noreen Evans said in a statement announcing the bill. ‘This was a huge tragedy for our entire community.’ Tragic death:  Andy Lopez, 13. was shot dead by police in Santa Rosa, California, mistaking his BB gun for an AK-47 . The teen’s BB gun would have fallen under the guidelines established by the new bill, should it be signed into law, and would have been a neon color instead of the dark brown that threw officers off. ‘Unfortunately, because of the strong resemblance to firearms, when officers must make split-second decisions on whether or not to use deadly force to protect the public,’ the statement continued. ‘These replica guns can trigger tragic consequences.’ Critics of similar regulations passed in other big cities have said bad guys will just paint their guns bright colors, NBC Los Angeles pointed out. ‘That is just a red herring,’ Ms Evans told the station. The State Senator cited a 1990 Department of Justice study showing more than 200 incidences of toy guns being mistaken for real guns each year as proof something must be done. No timetable has been set for when a vote is expected to be taken.","The bill is being sponsored by State Senator who represents the district where a 13-year-old Andy Lopez lived .

IT . consultant Gavin Moore, 31, from Hastings, East Sussex, said: ‘We have . saved for a family holiday to Africa for a long time and we are not . going to pack up and go home.’ Tour operators Thomson and First Choice have cancelled all flights to Kenya until the end of October as a result of the concerns . Michael Adebolajo (left) and Michael Adebowale (right) murdered British Army solder Drummer Lee Rigby in 2013 . Islamic militant group Al-Shabab, which means 'The Youth' in Arabic, was formed in 2006 as a radical offshoot of the Islamic justice system. It is thought to have between 9,000 and 15,000 members and in 2012, it joined the militant Islamist organisation al-Qaeda as a cell. The group wants to overthrow the UN-backed government in Somalia, and is suspected of links to a string of attacks in neighbouring Kenya. It has been pushed out of most of the main towns it once controlled, but it remains a potent threat. As of 2013, pressure from African Union Mission In Somalia (AMISOM) and Ethiopian forces has largely degraded Al-Shabab’s control and conflict among senior leaders has exacerbated fractures within the group. Following the death of British Army soldier Drummer Lee Rigby in May 2013, it emerged one of his murderers had travelled to Kenya to train with Al-Shabab. Michael Adebolajo, 29, was arrested in Kenya in 2010 with five others. At the time, the head of Kenya's anti-terrorism unit said he believed Adebolajo was planning to train with Al-Shabab, yet he was released to British authorities in Kenya and deported. Adebolajo and accomplice Michael Adebowale, 22, were convicted in December last year of murdering Fusilier Lee Rigby outside his barracks in Woolwich. The British Muslim converts ran him over in a car, almost decapitated him and then dragged him into the middle of the road while ordering onlookers to film them. Adebolajo was given a whole-life term and Adebowale was jailed for a minimum of 45 years. Explosion: Three people were killed and 16 were injured in a bomb attack at a Mombasa bus station earlier this month. Officials have blamed al-Shabab for the incident . Luxury: The coastal city of Mombasa is popular with British tourists, but many have had dream holidays cut short . Where exactly have tourists been warned they cannot go? The latest advice for tourists is to avoid all but essential travel to Mombasa Island and within 5km of the coast from Mtwapa creek, north of the city, and Tiwi in the south. However, the warning does not include the popular beach resort of Diani or Moi international airport, which is the gateway to the coast. I have a holiday booked on Kenya’s coast, will it be cancelled? Tour operators will cancel any holidays that are based in the areas that have now been declared off-limits. They are not obliged to cancel trips to other parts of Kenya. However, some companies, such as Thomson and First Choice, have also evacuated holidaymakers from Diani, which is not included in the latest advice. Therefore it is advisable to contact your holiday company to see what its policy is. My holiday has been cancelled, what are my rights? Rest assured, if you have booked through a tour operator you are entitled to a full refund or you will be offered an alternative trip. Customers who have booked flights and accommodation separately should expect to be refunded as long as their accommodation is . If you have booked your trip independently and have travel insurance it should pay out for any trips cancelled due to changing travel advice. Always make sure you check your policy closely.I am booked for a safari holiday and am not going near the south coast, will my trip still go ahead? Tour operators offering trips to areas that are not affected by the latest travel update will go ahead as usual.What if I have a holiday to Kenya booked but don’t want to go following this news?Unless your trip is to one of the affected areas which tourists have been advised to avoid then your booking still stands. Companies in general will not allow customers to cancel bookings to other parts of the country which are still considered safe according to government organisations.Where is considered safe? Almost all of the rest of Kenya, including popular safari areas, is considered safe. The only new areas tourists have been told to avoid are Mombasa island and within 5km of the coast from Mtwapa creek in the north down to and including Tiwi in the south. Long-standing advice about non-essential travel includes areas within 37 miles of the Kenya –Somali border, Kiwayu Island and coastal areas north of Pate Island (in the south east of the country), the Garissa district (in the east), the Eastleigh area of Nairobi and the slum areas of the Kenyan capital.","At least 13 people are feared to have died in twin bomb attacks in Nairobi .

"Tory MP Robert Halfon tore into UKIP and the views of its members . Some members of the UK Independence Party are  ‘literally akin to the Nazis’, according to a Tory MP.

He cited the example of UKIP immigration spokesman Gerard Batten, who believes that British Muslims should sign a special code of conduct rejecting violence. Mr Halfon, who is Jewish, said: ‘To me there are two kinds of UKIP – the [former defence spokesman] Godfrey Bloom guy who’s like a cross between Sid James and Bernard Manning, and then there's a much more sinister element, like the MEP who said every Muslim has got to sign a declaration of non-violence, which to me is literally akin to the Nazis saying Jews should wear a yellow star. ‘I genuinely find it abhorrent and frightening. I'm amazed that man is still an MEP. How someone could say such a thing and then not apologise for it…’ The MP said such people were not welcome in the Conservative Party and insisted he was glad they had been driven out by UKIP. ‘In many ways UKIP have done us an enormous favour because they're cleansing people from the Tory party that had these kinds of views, which is great because I don't want people who have those kinds of views in my party. So good luck to them, really,’ Mr Halfon told political magazine The House. His incendiary attack on Nigel .

Defence . minister Anna Soubry launched a blistering attack on Mr Farage when the . pair recently appeared on the BBC’s Question Time, accusing him of . putting ‘fear in people’s hearts’ by scaremongering about immigration. One . Tory minister said many in the party had been ‘appalled’ by a recent . ratcheting up of UKIP rhetoric, particularly at its spring conference . last weekend. Mr Farage used the gathering in Torquay to express his . alarm at hearing foreign languages spoken when he travelled by train. But . the UKIP leader attacked Mr Halfon for directing ‘hysterical slurs’ at . UKIP and its members and said he intended to step up campaigning in his . constituency of Harlow. Last year in the county council elections, UKIP scored between 25 per cent and 30 per cent of the votes cast in the seat. Mr Farage said: ‘Mr Halfon's . hysterical slurs are the result of a growing Tory terror of UKIP's . rising popularity all over the country. ‘Because . I believe in taking politics and the big arguments directly to the . people, UKIP will now be having a national action day in Harlow. Let the . voters of Harlow hear what we have got to say. I know that many of them . are already flocking to our side. ‘As . we approach the next general election, we will also consider whether to . add Harlow to our target seat list given the positive response of . people in the town to our message.’ Mr Halfon said Ukip members were either comedy characters like the party's former MEP Godfrey Bloom, (left) or had more extreme views, such as UKIP immigration spokesman Gerard Batten (right), who believes that British Muslims should sign a special code of conduct rejecting violence . UKIP Euro election candidate Patrick . O'Flynn said: ‘UKIP is the only party that believes in standing up for . ordinary people by supporting border controls, whilst Mr Halfon's party . continues to back uncontrolled mass immigration from the EU with no . volume control and no quality control either. ‘Mr . Halfon’s idea that a party led by David Cameron and George Osborne will . ever appeal to ordinary working families is deluded. But it is a shame . to see him resort to gutter politics in a desperate bid to save his seat . at next year’s general election.’ Mr Halfon used his interview to insist the Tories were ‘slowly’ demonstrating they are on the side of ‘white van Conservatism’. ‘The . Labour Party give people safety nets, whereas we give them ladders. The . problem for Conservatives is always: what are we about? Freedom – well . what does that really mean to the person on street? Ukip leader Nigel Farage has sought to prevent further embarrassment for the party by checking the views and background of candidates . Mr Halfon went on: '‘Sovereignty, Europe... it’s all esoteric stuff. Partly Conservatism is a way of life – by habit you tend to be more traditional and so on. But actually the thing that we’re about is the ladder. ‘We’re slowly doing it, saying we’re the party for hardworking people, but we’ve got to build a real narrative around it, a real passion that we’re there to help the working poor and not only that, we’re there to help people who aren’t working get into work. ‘I believe Tory modernisation should be about one thing and that is being the party for the working poor – for people on low incomes. And everything else should follow. ‘We may get into coalition again, we may even win a small majority of 10 or 20 MPs, but we’ll never have a big majority unless we have a real narrative and working people think that we are speaking for them.’","Conservative Robert Halfon tears into Ukip and the views of its members .

"Employees of a fast food restaurant in Texas fled the service counter and locked themselves inside a freezer, convinced they were being held up, after a group of armed men walked in last Thursday. But the band of gun-toting 'bandits' turned out to be members of Open Carry Texas, the pro-gun group, who were on their way to a peaceful demonstration. The police were equally as convinced they were dealing with a robbery, with at least a dozen officers showing up at the Jack in the Box in Fort Worth. 'I would estimate around 10 squad cars showed up, some with two per squad car,' demonstrator Edwin Haros told NBC 5. An employee at a Jack In The Box in Fort Worth, Texas, poses with members of the pro-gun group Open Carry Texas . Police speak with members of Open Carry Texas outside the restaurant in Fort Worth where they were staging a demonstration, which scared some people . Full force: An estimated 10 squad cars arrived at the scene, believing it to be a full-scale robbery by a heavily-armed gang . 'I believe we counted more than 15 officers showed up on scene.' While the protestors - who advocate that gun owners should be able to openly carry firearms - expressed upset at the way police handled the situation. However the authorities said anyone would have done the same. '(The staff) locked themselves inside a freezer for protection out of fear the rifle-carrying men would rob them,' Sgt. Ray Bush, with the Fort Worth Police Department, said. 'The demonstration had no signage that would have alerted anyone to their real purpose, and to our knowledge they did not attempt to contact anyone in the Fort Worth Police Department to advise us prior to the demonstration.' Open Carry Texas were 'pushing for the right to carry handguns in public' outside the restaurant. Scene: The incident occurred at this Jack in the Box in Fort Worth, Texas, on Thursday . Supporter: Open Carry Texas demonstrator Edwin Haros said he is entitled to carry a gun because 'police can't always be there' Haros said they were 'not trying to alarm anybody'. 'We're doing this because it's our constitutional right.' Open Carry Texas members returned to the Jack in the Box following the incident for another meal, taking a photo with the employees, who had since retreated from the freezer. This isn't the first time Open Carry Texas has been involved in controversies surrounding guns and restaurants.

A year ago Labour leader Ed Miliband was hailed as an 'action hero' after coming to the rescue of a cyclist. The Labour leader leapt into action after Ella Phillips, 29, was thrown over the handlebar of her bike in North London. She described the moment he appeared 'out of nowhere' to offer assistance, admitting she almost did not recognise him becoming he was so 'suave' in the flesh. Miss Phillips fell off her her bike after crashing into a cyclist who suddenly stopped in front of her. She was so stunned when she saw the Labour leader looming over her, she thought she must be concussed. 'He mysteriously appeared out of nowhere, a bit like an action hero,' she said at the time.","Prime Minister and Mayor Boris Johnson travelling in north London .

"A shocking video has emerged that appears to show Egyptian police standing idly by as an anti-Christian mob launch a frenzied attack on a cathedral filled with mourners. Two worshippers were left dead and 84 injured, including 11 police officers, as men shooting guns, wielding machetes and hurling stones laid siege to the walled Coptic cathedral compound in Cairo earlier this month. Footage of the prolonged mass attack shows uniformed officers looking on and appearing to help one gunman take aim at people streaming out of a service held for five men killed in an earlier clash with Muslims.

The fighting erupted on April 7 after a mass funeral for the five Copts who were killed . during violent clashes in a north Egyptian town. The new footage of the attacks was first obtained by MidEast Christian News. A Muslim . man also died in the clashes in the Abbassia District of Cairo, which happened after an Islamic institute . was daubed with offensive graffiti. The only arrests that were made afterwards were of four Copts, who were already outraged over a three-day attack that began April 4 attack in Khosous. It saw the four men killed and homes, a nursery and a church burned, said the events show how elusive justice is for Christians, who make up about 10 per cent of the nation's population. Andrew Johnston, advocacy director for Christian Solidarity Worldwide, told Fox News: 'Two Copts were killed during the attack on the Cathedral; four more died in Khosous, yet not one of their attackers has been arrested. 'These arrests come at a time when the Coptic community in Egypt is still coming to terms with an unprecedented attack on the headquarters of the Coptic Orthodox Church and the violence in Khosous.

'Such discrepancies in the discharge of justice contribute to impunity, and can only foster more sectarianism.' Tensions between Egypt's Christians and the majority Sunni Muslims have grown dramatically since President Hosni Mubarak was ousted in 2011 and replaced by the Muslim Brotherhood-led government of Mohammed Morsi. A report released on Wednesday by the Egyptian National Council for Human Rights said: 'There is a general feeling among citizens about the absence of law and the prestige of the state. 'Such a feeling could push the citizens to the violence and sectarianism without fearing from any deterrence. 'The recent incident proved the shrinking of the role of the state to control the actions of the individuals especially those people who think that they talk on the behalf of God,' the report continued. 'There is a need for implementing the law strictly to treat such incidents.'","Men with guns, wielding machetes and hurling stones laid siege to cathedral .

"Alex Salmond begins the most crucial week yet in the battle for Scotland’s future – without the hoped-for Commonwealth Games ‘bounce’ in favour of independence. Three days before Mr Salmond’s live TV debate with anti-independence campaign leader Alistair Darling, a poll for The Mail on Sunday revealed no boost for the ‘Yes’ campaign from the Games in Glasgow. The Survation survey, the first of Scottish voters to be conducted since the Games began, puts the ‘Yes’ vote on 40 per cent – down one point on last month – and ‘No’ unchanged on 46 per cent. The outcome will be a bitter disappointment for Scottish Nationalists, who had hoped that scheduling the independence referendum on September 18 on the back of the Games would lead to a surge of votes to break up the UK. Scroll down for video . Unaware: Surrounded by saltires, Mr Salmond is unaware of the solitary Union flag behind his head . Daniel Wallace of Scotland celebrates winning the gold in the Men's 400m Individual Medley Final . It also flies in the face of reports that a feel-good factor at Glasgow’s success in staging the Games and Scotland’s record haul of medals would provide a so-called ‘Braveheart bounce’ and revitalise the ‘Yes’ campaign. But the survey does show that Scottish First Minister Mr Salmond is a clear favourite to win Tuesday night’s debate – the first head-to-head contest between the two campaign leaders. The charismatic Scottish Nationalist leader is backed by 37 per cent of voters to come out on top, with barely one in ten predicting that dour ex-Labour Cabinet Minister Mr Darling will triumph. The result will heap pressure on Mr Darling, the chairman of the anti-independence Better Together campaign, who faced criticism that he is too lacklustre to take on ‘showman’ Mr Salmond. Opponents: Alex Salmond (left) wants an independent Scotland while Alastair Darting (right) wants a Union . The televised debate, before a studio audience of 300 drawn from ‘Yes’, ‘No’ and undecided voters, is seen as crucial if Mr Salmond is to overhaul a stubborn anti-independence lead in the polls. Yesterday, it emerged that Mr Salmond has been having performance lessons from a lifestyle coach ahead of the showdown. But in an article for The Mail on Sunday Danny Alexander, the MP for Inverness, backs Mr Darling to present the ‘clear, unvarnished’ case for staying in the UK, in contrast to the ‘verbal acrobatics’ of Mr Salmond. David Cameron has faced criticism for refusing to take on the First Minister himself in a TV debate. And the poll reveals nearly half of Scottish voters brand the Prime Minister a coward. Danny Alexander, the MP for Inverness, backs Mr Darling to present the ‘clear, unvarnished’ case for staying in the UK . However, more than one in three agree that he was sensible to leave Mr Darling – as a Scot – to tackle Mr Salmond. The Survation poll found that more than 80 per of voters say the Games have made no difference to how they were likely to vote. Only 12 per cent said they were more likely to vote ‘Yes’, with some voters (7 per cent) even saying it would actually make them more inclined to vote against independence. A spokesman for the Yes campaign said the poll was ‘very encouraging’ and matched evidence that the result was too close to call. A spokesman for Mr Salmond said: ‘This poll makes clear that Scots believe David Cameron is afraid to take part in a debate with the First Minister.’","First poll of Scottish voters conducted since the Games began puts ‘Yes’ vote on 40% – down one point on last month .

"Warning: Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby has warned that gay marriage could put Anglicans around the world in danger . A Church of England decision to accept gay marriage would be ‘absolutely catastrophic’ for Christians in troubled countries, the Archbishop of Canterbury said yesterday. Anglicans in countries such as South Sudan, Nigeria and Pakistan are in danger as a result of liberal positions taken by the leaders of churches in the west, he said. The Most Reverend Justin Welby said he had visited a grave containing 369 bodies in South Sudan, where some people believed ‘if we leave a Christian community here we will all be made to become homosexual and so we will kill all the Christians’. He said on an LBC radio phone-in that while he was deeply concerned with the suffering of gay people in Britain, the issue of gay rights was not simple. The Archbishop and other CofE leaders have given regular hints of a softened line on homosexuality, and a high-level Synod report has said clergy should be able to conduct blessings for gay couples. He told a caller who said vicars should be allowed to make up their own minds on gay weddings: ‘What we say here is heard around the world. Why can’t we just do it now? ‘Because the impact of that on Christians in countries far from here, like South Sudan, like Pakistan, Nigeria and other places would be absolutely catastrophic and we have to love them as much as the people who are here. ‘I’ve stood by a graveside in Africa of a group of Christians who’d been attacked because of something that had happened far, far away in America. And they were attacked by other people because of that. ‘The mass grave had 369 bodies in it and I was standing with the relatives. That burns itself into your soul, as does the suffering of gay people in this country.’ Dilemma: The Archbishop said he had agonised over his support for gay rights issues . The Archbishop said gay rights was ‘really not a simple issue’ and added: ‘It’s something that I wrestle with every day and often in the middle of the night.’ ‘We have to listen incredibly carefully to the LGBT communities here . . . and we have to look at the tradition of the Church, and the teaching of the Church, and the teaching of scripture, which is definitive in the end, before we come to a conclusion. ‘But we’re not in a position just to suddenly say, okay our position in this country has changed.’ The Archbishop is the head of the worldwide Anglican communion, which has nearly 80million worshippers and is highly influential in countries in Africa and Asia where the confrontation between Islam and Christianity is often violent. Celebration: But gay marriage poses a danger to Anglicans in countries such as South Sudan and Pakistan, Mr Welby said . One caller on the phone-in show was former Tory MP Ann Widdecombe, who left the Church of England for the Roman Catholic church in 1993 after the CofE chose to ordain women as priests. Miss Widdecombe suggested to the Archbishop that his ‘heart has just sunk’ after hearing her voice. She said she left the CofE partly because it ‘never seems to know what it thinks about anything’. He replied: ‘I think I’m right, you think I’m wrong. We differ.’","Welby says Anglicans will be in danger if CofE recognises gay marriage .

"A mother who fell pregnant at 11 has spoken of the ordeal she faced after her daughter's birth. Tressa Middleton, now 20, has revealed the trauma she experienced as a warning to Britain's youngest mother who gave birth on Sunday. Miss Middleton, from Bathgate, West Lothian, was five months older than the schoolgirl when she fell pregnant in 2005 - as a result she spent several years addicted to drugs and alcohol after quitting school. Tressa Middleton with her mother and daughter in 2006. Tressa Middleton, now 20, wants to offer advice to Britain's youngest mother who gave birth on Sunday after falling pregnant aged just 11 years and six month . She was forced to give up her toddler for adoption two years after giving birth - the decision came after she revealed the baby was born as the result of a rape by her own brother. Today Miss Middleton said she wanted to get in touch with Britain’s youngest parents - the schoolgirl, who became pregnant by her 13-year-old ‘boyfriend’ when she was still in primary school at the age of 11 and gave birth to a 7lb 4oz girl at the weekend. Miss Middleton told The Sun: 'I send her my warmest congratulations but it will be incredibly tough. At that age you’re so worried about what other people think at school. 'I had people throwing things at me with the baby in the buggy. And the bullies taunting you in the playground -  that’s the worst.' New record: A couple have become Britain's youngest parents after a girl aged 12 gave birth. Their faces have been pixellated to protect their identities . Miss Middleton discovered she was pregnant in 2005 and at first claimed a local boy was the father to protect her mother, Tracey Tallons, 39. After giving birth she describes that she never stopped the 'fags and drink', and soon spiralled out of control under the very noses of her social workers. She ended up in a residential unit, rather than with her child. 'It went downhill from there,' she told the Daily Mail in 2012. 'I was seeing her, but only for short periods. 'She went from calling me Mum and reaching out for me, to not wanting to come near me. She would be screaming. New record: A couple have become Britain's youngest parents after a girl aged 12 gave birth. Their faces have been pixellated to protect their identities . She tried to commit suicide when she saw authorities were going to take the child away in 2008, swallowing as many drugs as she could. She told friends she 'didn't want her baby to have a mother who was this f***** up anyway'. But her stomach was pumped, and her life saved. When she was 14, she finally revealed that her twisted brother Jason was in fact the father of her child. When it came out, her family fell apart in the event, and Miss Middleton was left to sign papers authorising the adoption. 'I signed the papers because I knew I would lose in court and they would take her from me anyway. This way I thought I would get visitation rights.' But she hasn't seen her daughter for six years  - not since she handed her over to her adoptive parents, 'who seemed very nice'. She is only entitled to a letter twice a year, updating her on her child's progress. She says she has kept all her child's clothes, and sleeps with a little pink Babygro and hat under her pillow. 'I know the adoption was in her interests. She'll have a better life. But she is still my little angel. She's my girl and I want contact with her. I'd do anything for her.' In 2009 Jason Middleton was jailed for four years. He was 16 when the attack happened, at the family home in West Lothian, five years older than his sister. She says the rape was not a one-off, but part of a wider pattern of abuse. In 2012 their mother died of pneumonia aged 41 and Miss Middleton says the funeral finally allowed her to forgive her brother. She said: 'We were both in bits. We didn’t speak to each other but I didn’t feel any hatred towards him. I know what he did was wrong, and so does he.' Miss Middleton, who is unemployed, is now desperately trying rebuild her life with her fiancé Darren Young, 27, who she meet in 2010. She fell pregnant with his child when she was 18, but she miscarried a . few months later - the couple still hope to have a family soon. Talking about her daughter Miss . Middleton says: 'I would have given my life for her'  -  but it was a . complex relationship. There were times I looked at her and I saw my . brother Jason in her face. That made it hard. But I still loved her, . with all my heart.'","Tressa Middleton, now 20, wants to help Britain’s youngest mother .

Lexie Kamerman, who had worked at the American University of Afghanistan since June, died when explosives were detonated outside the popular La Taverna du Liban restaurant, Chicago Sun-Times reported. The Chicago woman's devastated family have described her as 'an amazing young woman - smart, strong, beautiful, funny, stubborn and kind. And fearless.' Scroll down for video . Victim: Lexie Kamerman, a 27-year-old university student development specialist, was one of three Americans killed in a deadly suicide attack in Kabul which claimed 21 lives on Friday . Heartbreaking: The family of Lexie Kamerman, 27, described her as 'smart, strong, beautiful, funny, stubborn and kind' 'She took the job at the American . University of Afghanistan to help the young women of Afghanistan get an . education and take their rightful place as leaders in Afghan society,' the family's statement said. Kamerman completed a Masters in higher education at the University of Arizona in 2012 and was a keen water polo player. One of Kamerman's university colleagues was also killed in the blast, along with a U.S. victim identified by the United Nations as a Somali-American. Afghan police said 13 foreigners and eight Afghans died when a suicide bomber blew himself up outside the Lebanese restaurant, which is popular with tourists, while two gunmen entered through the back door and opened fire. Two Canadians, one from Quebec and the other from Ontario, were also killed. The Samson and Associates employees were in the Afghan capital doing auditing work for the Canadian International Development Agency. 'This is the first time that we've ever had such a thing,' company chief Pierre Samson said, explaining that his firm has done work in Afghanistan for some time. 'As auditors we're not on the front so we don't usually go where it is very dangerous, but in a case like this the attack was directly in town, so it was not in a danger area. But unfortunately we were there at a bad time.' Scene: More than 20 people died when explosives were detonated at the gate of the popular La Taverna du Liban restaurant, a Lebanese eatery popular with tourists . European Parliament election hopeful: Labour leader Ed Miliband  confirmed that Del Singh, right, who had been campaigning to become MEP for the South West, was killed in a suicide attack in Kabul . Samson said he was given the news Friday evening by the Canadian embassy in Kabul. He didn't identify the men because his firm is still trying to get in touch with family members. Others identified were two Britons - development specialist Dharmender Singh Phangura, also known as Del Singh, and close protection officer Simon Chase - two Lebanese, a Danish police officer, a Russian, a Malaysian and a Pakistani. Phangura, who along with the Malaysian worked as an adviser for Adam Smith International, was to run as a Labour Party candidate in upcoming elections for the European Parliament. Also among the dead were the International Monetary Fund's Lebanese representative, Wabel Abdallah, and Vadim Nazarov, a Russian who was the chief political affairs officer at the U.N. Mission in Afghanistan. Nazarov was one of the U.N's most experienced officials, fluent in the country's languages and with experience dating back to the 1980s. He was one of three U.N. victims. Operation: Afghan security forces arrive at the scene of the explosion in the capital, Kabul . The attack comes as security has been deteriorating and apprehension has been growing among Afghans over their country's future as U.S.-led foreign forces prepare for a final withdrawal at the end of the year. Afghan President Hamid Karzai, who is deferring signing an agreement allowing U.S. forces to stay past the planned withdraw until after the country's April 5 presidential election, criticized America while condemning the attack. 'If NATO forces and in the lead the United States of America want to cooperate and be united with Afghan people, they must target terrorism,' he said without fully elaborating on what America should be doing. He added that America had followed a policy that 'was not successful in the past decade'. Order: A solider organises his colleagues in the street outside the restaurant in the Afghan capital . Police: Armed officers surround the scene after the bombing. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack an hour later . Meanwhile, the attack was condemned by the U.N. Security Council, NATO, the White House and the European Union. 'There is no possible justification for this attack, which has killed innocent civilians, including Americans, working every day to help the Afghan people achieve a better future with higher education and economic assistance,' the White House said in a statement on Saturday. Insurgents have frequently targeted foreign interests around the country and in Kabul. However Friday's horrific blast has been described as . the deadliest single attack against foreign civilians in the course of a . nearly 13-year U.S.-led war. Wounded: Police carry an injured victim from the scene of a suicide bombing in a restaurant in Kabul, Afghanistan . Treatment: Kebab cook Abdul Majid is stretchered into the Wazir Akbar Khan hospital following the deadly attacked . Survived: The cook witnesses the attacked and was left with broken bones as he fled the scene . The . Taliban claimed responsibility within an hour of the attack, which was . said to be part of a stepped-up campaign of violence against foreign and . government interests. It . is believed the extremists are trying to send a message that they are . not going anywhere as the involvement of foreign troops winds down this . year. The attack was carried out at a time when the restaurant would have been busy with diners. The suicide attacker detonated his explosives outside the gate of the heavily-fortified restaurant, the country’s Deputy Interior Minister Mohammad Ayoub Salangi said. Then two gunmen entered the restaurant and started shooting at survivors inside. The attackers were eventually shot dead by security forces when they arrived at the scene. The area is home to a number of foreign embassies and organizations. Jan Kubis, the UN Secretary-General's Special Representative for Afghanistan, said: 'I strongly condemn condemn the targeting of civilians in any form, and, in particular, the continued use of suicide bombers. 'This violence is unacceptable and must stop immediately.'

"A Wisconsin billionaire has pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of having sexual contact with a teenage girl. Samuel 'Curt' Johnson III, whose family has run home-products giant SC Johnson for five generations, was convicted of fourth-degree sexual assault and disorderly conduct. He was sentenced to four months in jail, short of the one-year maximum. He was also fined $6,000. Before sentencing Friday, the 59-year-old apologized to the victim and her mother for 'the tremendous hurt I have caused.' Defendant: Curt Johnson, left, and his attorney, Mark Richards, appearing in Racine County Court . Judge Eugene Gasiorkiewicz allowed the downgrade of charges. Then he sentenced Johnson to four months in jail, short of the one-year maximum. Johnson was also fined $6,000. The plea deal also means the married father of four children will not have to register as a sex offender. Johnson was charged in 2011 with indecently touching a girl when she was aged between 12 and 15 years old. According to JS Online, the case had been bogged down over a request by Johnson's defense team that the girl, now 17, be asked to turn over notes from her therapy sessions before she be allowed to testify against Johnson. Original appearance: Curt Johnson, the former chairman of Diversey, Inc., listens to defense attorney Michael Hart discuss bond recommendations, as he is charged three years ago in Racine County Circuit Court . A trial judge had proposed that the girl be allowed to testify but make the jury aware that she had declined to make her therapy records available to the judge, ad therefore they could presume the records would have been beneficial to Johnson's case. In March, however, the Court of Appeals rejected that option and ruled that the girl could not testify unless she allowed a judge to see her mental health records. The girl refused to allow a judge to see her therapy session notes and therefore was not allowed to testify. Without her testimony, prosecutors had little chance of achieving a conviction on such serious charges for Johnson. Plea deal: The billionaire will serve four months in prison and pay a fine of $6,000 . According to JS Online, the case grew out of Johnson's statements to his own therapist, who was required by law to report potential child abuse to authorities. Johnson's family founded and runs the SC Johnson home products company, but he has not been affiliated with the conglomerate for 18 years, a company spokesperson told MailOnline. He was the chairman of the Diversey, Inc subsidiary of the company but resigned in 2010 citing 'personal reasons.' The company was bought in 2011 by Sealed Air. Johnson is estimated by Forbes to be worth about $3 billion.","Samuel 'Curt' Johnson pleaded guilty to sexual contact with a teenager .

"Detectives are believed to be investigating the death of a prominent British hotelier found dead inside a burnt out Range Rover on the tropical island of St Lucia. A charred body, identified locally as Oliver ‘Ollie’ Gobat, 38, was discovered hours after his family - who run a £405-a-night five star boutique hotel - reported him missing. Sources have suggested the victim had . been shot twice in the head before being doused with petrol and set . alight - although island police would not confirm this. British hotelier Oliver Gobat (pictured left with his sister-in-law Alexandra See), was found in a burnt out Range Rover on the island of St Lucia . Police and the Foreign Office would not confirm the victim's name - but double Olympic decathlon gold medallist Daley Thompson paid a personal tribute to the man on Twitter. The sportsman has carried out fitness workshops at the family’s luxurious Cap Maison hotel on the island. He wrote: 'My love&thoughts go out to friends&family of Ollie Gobat. he was a gem& his family must have been so proud of him. RIP my friend. X’ Unconfirmed reports from St Lucia suggest Mr Gobat’s family lodged a ‘missing person’ report with police after he failed to return home on Friday night. The vehicle he owns matches the description of the Range Rover which was discovered with the body inside around 9pm last Friday. The body of the prominent island businessman, in his late thirties, was said to have been ‘burnt beyond recognition’ and was found in the front passenger seat. The FCO is working with island authorities to help identify the body after news emerged of the death. One of the rooms at Cap Maison - the hotel run by the Gobat family. Rooms cost up to £400 per night . Paradise: Cap Maison estate of luxury apartments and hotel in the Caribbean run by Mr Gobat .

"The 29-year-old Jamaican, known only as JR, will not be sent home because as a homosexual, it would violate his human rights, a judge ruled (file image) An illegal immigrant who stabbed a 15-year-old  schoolboy to death less than a year after arriving in Britain cannot be deported because he claims to be gay, judges ruled yesterday. The 29-year-old Jamaican was jailed for life aged 16 when he and another schoolboy knifed Abdul Maye to death over a £10 debt outside his school in east London. A judge at the Old Bailey ordered that he be kicked out of Britain once he had served a minimum of eight years. Judge Paul Focke told the thug, who cannot not be named for legal reasons: ‘You are a Jamaican national and within months of coming to this country you committed murder. ‘I am of the view that your continued presence in this country will be detrimental to its citizens.’ But yesterday, the Court of Appeal ruled that he could not be sent back to Jamaica because he could face degrading treatment for being homosexual that would breach his human rights. In an extraordinary judgment which has provoked outrage, Lord Justice Kay said he believed his mother’s evidence that he was  gay – even though the Home Office said he ‘had made no mention of it’ until his first appeal against deportation failed. The decision is expected to infuriate Home Secretary Theresa May, who has battled to send him home since he was released from prison in 2012. The judge referred to Article Three in the Human Rights Act, which protects an individual from inhuman or degrading treatment. Douglas Carswell, Tory MP for Clacton, said: ‘Most people would think this is outrageous. It’s a gross distortion of the concept of justice. ‘Until we have freed ourselves from the European Convention on Human Rights, these sorts of basket-case decisions will carry on happening thick and fast.’ Peter Bone, Tory MP for Wellingborough, said: ‘Whether or not this man is sent back should be entirely at the discretion of British courts. ‘The idea that his human rights should have any impact whatever when he has come in to this country illegally in the first place to murder someone is absurd. ‘When it comes to murderers, courts should have the absolute right to sentence people for as long as they want, or to send them home immediately after.’ 'When it comes to murderers, courts should have the absolute right to sentence people for as long as they want, or to send them home immediately' - Peter Bone MP . The murderer, referred to only as JR, arrived in the UK in December 2000 when he was 15 on a temporary visa to visit his  mother. An application for leave to stay longer was refused, but the yob remained in the country anyway. And less than a year later he and a 14-year-old stabbed a fellow schoolboy to ‘save face’ after he humiliated them by refusing to pay a £10 debt – a payment which he owed them for cannabis. The Old Bailey heard JR, who only has an IQ of 63 – putting him in the lowest two per cent of the population – knifed Abdul in front of his horrified classmates outside Little Ilford Comprehensive School in Manor Park after the victim had just finished a mock GCSE exam on December 7, 2001. The victim, whose family fled to Britain from the civil war in Somalia in 1995, died shortly afterwards in hospital. In the weeks beforehand, the schoolboys had threatened to ‘chop’ or ‘stab’ the victim and the Jamaican sprayed him and a friend with CS gas. The pair were jailed for life in September 2002 and told to serve a minimum of eight years and two months. But this was reduced on appeal to six years and two months with the deportation recommendation set aside. However, the Secretary of State ordered JR’s deportation in 2009. Human rights: The Jamaican, known only as JR, has been allowed to stay in Britain by the Court of Appeal . When his first appeal failed, the killer submitted a fresh bid against deportation in April 2012 arguing for the first time that he was gay. JR successfully appealed her decision to deport him to the First-Tier Tribunal (FTT), and won again at the Upper Tribunal when Mrs May challenged that decision last year. Now, Lord Justice Kay, sitting with Lord Justice Lewison and Sir Stanley Burnton at the Court of Appeal in London, has blocked the Government's final attempt to have JR deported. The judge said JR spent 11 and a half years in custody before declaring himself gay in April 2012. The First-Tier Tribunal accepted he was homosexual, and that he would be at risk of 'inhuman or degrading treatment' if returned to Jamaica. The Upper Tribunal later refused Mrs May's appeal, after hearing JR's mother give evidence that she 'knew all along' that her son was gay. His 'late disclosure' of his sexuality was said to have been 'prompted by societal attitudes, particularly that of Jamaicans towards gays'. At the Court of Appeal, Catherine Rowlands, for Mrs May, argued that the offender's eleventh hour assertion of homosexuality should have been rejected 'on credibility grounds', as 'he had made no mention of it' during a previous asylum application. Last month Mafia don Domenico Rancadore escaped deportation to his native Italy after a British judge ruled that the cramped Italian jails would breach his human rights. The 65-year-old who fled arrest in Italy 20 years ago and came to Britain, where he has lived ever since, was sentenced to seven years in prison in his home country for running a branch of the Mafia involved in drug trafficking, extortion and racketeering. In December 2013 a Somali criminal with a history of violence was allowed to walk free after a High Court judge ruled that detaining him any longer would breach his human rights. Abdi Ismail, 33, was convicted of a string of crimes since arriving in Britain in 1993, including racially aggravated threatening behaviour and assault on police. In 2011, he was sentenced to a 15-month jail term for assault and told he would be deported after attacking a friend with a knife, but a judge let him walk free after deciding he had been detained for too long. Last year, a vicious Somali rapist who was jailed for ten years after threatening to kill his pregnant victim as he raped her was allowed to stay in Britain because he has other family members here. Mustafa Abdullahi, 31, came to Britain aged 11 and immigration judges ruled he had been in the UK so long that deportation would deprive him of the right to a family life. The barrister argued that 'the claim of homosexuality was contrived and brought as a last resort to avoid deportation.' But Lord Justice Kay dismissed the appeal, saying the FTT had obviously found JR's mother 'an impressive witness'. He . added: 'I consider that the Upper Tribunal was correct to find no error . of law in the FTT's treatment of the issue of homosexuality'. Mrs . May accepted that, if the man was genuinely gay, he could not be . deported, and the Upper Tribunal had also found that he 'no longer . constitutes a significant danger to the community of the UK.' The judge went on: 'It follows from what I have said that the Secretary of State's appeal must fail.' But . in a warning to any offenders hoping to avoid deportation by pretending . to be gay, he added: 'I should add, however, that this case turns on . its specific and quite unusual facts. It should not be seen as providing . more general succour to others convicted of grave crimes.'","Jamaican man, 29, arrived in Britain in December 2000 when he was 15 .

"Young parliamentary researchers last night claimed their parents would be ‘horrified’ if they knew the lurid truth of what goes on at the ‘Palace of Sexminster’. One aide said there were rumours of MPs and peers using date rape drugs on junior activists, or paying for abortions after getting their staff pregnant. Others claimed former ministers had been accused of manhandling women on the Commons terrace and that sex acts and drug-taking regularly took place in toilets. Yesterday there were calls for an urgent overhaul of Westminster’s late-night drinking culture to prevent more damaging sleaze scandals from engulfing Parliament. The Palace of Westminster - or the 'Palace of Sexminster' as it's been dubbed after a string of scandals - is rife with rumours of MPs acting inappropriately towards their young staff members . The comments come two days after Nigel Evans, the former deputy speaker, was unanimously cleared of a series of sexual assaults. The case shone a light on the drink-fuelled culture at Westminster – which has been labelled the ‘Palace of Sexminster’ after a string of sexual harassment allegations. A study released at the end of the trial also found that a third of researchers said they had been subjected to harassment. The claims come just two days after former deputy speaker Nigel Evans was unanimously cleared at the end of his trial for a string of sexual offences . Yesterday the Tory researcher who gave evidence against Mr Evans decided to lift the lid on the reality of life in ‘the Westminster bubble’. He said colleagues – many of whom were straight out of university – were often so desperate to progress in their careers that they did not report sexual assaults. The 35-year-old, who had claimed Mr Evans had put his hand down his trousers at a Conservative Party conference in 2003 but was brought to court despite insisting he was not a victim, added: ‘I think an awful lot of parents of people who work in Parliament would be horrified if they saw the reality of what life in the Westminster bubble is like.’ The Tory activist, who is married, added: ‘Parliament needs to get a grip on this alcohol-fuelled sleaze before it brews into something worse than the expenses scandal that destroys all trust in MPs. There is a problem and the politicians need to act. Otherwise a story will come out that starts an onslaught that makes the accusations we have heard in the last few weeks seem like small fry.’ He said politicians work long hours away from their families and are surrounded by ‘impressionable straight-out-of-university ambitious people’. ‘It’s a recipe for an awful lot of borderline people to be pushed over the edge and unfortunately that gives all MPs a bad name,’ he said. He did not know if rumours of MPs using date rape drugs and paying for abortions were true, but said he heard allegations ‘all of the time’. ‘Most of these will be largely untrue, but there will be some reason why that rumour started in the first place,’ he added. ‘I think the sleazy nature of MPs hanging around with people who are just out of university, it does not look good. ‘We’re now living in an age when everyone’s got a camera in their pocket. At some point someone is going to take a photo in the Strangers’ Bar of someone behaving in a way they shouldn’t and it’s going to balloon and some very serious allegations will come forward, and by that point it will be too late and Parliament will have to act.’ Chief whip Sir George Young, left, wrote to MPs asking them to sign up to a code of ethics regarding the treatment of staff, while the Speaker, John Bercow, right, has set up a helpline for staff . He is now calling for bars in Parliament to have 9pm curfews for researchers. ‘You’ve got bars where people know each other, relatively cheap alcohol, and a lot of people who are up for a good gossip and like a bit of scandal,’ he added. ‘A lot of people like that atmosphere, but it is clearly causing problems. ‘Some parliamentary staff do actively encourage MPs to behave in a certain way, and the only reason MPs behave in that way is because on some occasions that behaviour may have resulted in “success”.’ Another man who made allegations about Mr Evans, who was unanimously cleared on all counts by a jury at Preston Crown Court on Thursday, said there was no proper way to deal with complaints. He told Newsnight: ‘The strange thing about Parliament is that they make the laws but they don’t act like any other place of business. Tory MP Sir Bob Stewart argued there was no need for a voluntary code of conduct . ‘Researchers and MPs’ staff don’t have an HR department. Our bosses are technically self-employed and we’re all small businesses so even though we work in one big building together there was no mechanism to deal with this problem, and there still isn’t.’ Even last night there were rumours circulating Parliament that a former minister, who until recently was married, was reported to party whips after making a pass at a straight male MP. Two male researchers, now MPs, also allegedly fought after one said his drink was spiked and woke to find that he was being raped by the other. Conservative party chiefs yesterday released a code of conduct for MPs. Sir George Young, the chief whip, wrote to MPs to urge them to sign up to the code, which said staff should be treated with ‘dignity, respect and courtesy’ and should be ‘free from any form of discrimination, victimisation, harassment or bullying’. They should also not have to endure ‘unwelcome behaviour and inappropriate language’. But it has been criticised for telling MPs that grievances are ‘entirely a matter for you to handle’. One researcher told the Mail: ‘How is that going to work? If you have a problem with your boss, you don’t exactly feel comfortable with telling them about it, particularly if your career is entirely in their hands.’ However, a Tory source said staff would still be able to go to a ‘pastoral care unit’ and would also be encouraged to speak to party whips. Commons Speaker John Bercow has also set up a helpline for staff. Tory MP Sir Bob Stewart argued there was no need for a voluntary code of conduct and laughed it off, saying: ‘I’ve tried my best to behave.’ He told the BBC Daily Politics that boorish behaviour did not dominate the Commons, adding that ‘people act out of line in any profession’. On Thursday, a Channel 4 News investigation named ‘The Palace of Sexminster’ found nearly a quarter of researchers from all parties had witnessed or heard about sex harassment.","Palace of Westminster has been dubbed 'Palace of Sexminster' after a string of scandals .

"Lawyer Phil Shiner's Public Interest Lawyers are representing Iraqi witnesses accused of fabricating claims that prisoners were tortured . Iraqis conspired to claim that British troops executed and tortured prisoners to secure huge compensation payouts, a public inquiry heard on Wednesday. Detainees and families of the dead allegedly colluded to pervert the course of justice by insisting UK soldiers murdered, mutilated and mistreated captives. In a closing statement to the Al Sweady Inquiry, lawyers for the troops and Ministry of Defence said accusations of war crimes were ‘manifestly untrue’. Iraqi witnesses – represented by Phil Shiner’s Public Interest Lawyers – ‘dishonestly’ fabricated claims because of an ‘ulterior motive in the form of financial compensation’, they said. The inquiry is examining allegations that British troops executed 20 or more prisoners and mistreated nine others at Camp Abu Naji near Basra in May 2004. It followed a ferocious firefight with insurgents dubbed the Battle of Danny Boy, named after a checkpoint. But after a year-long hearing costing taxpayers £23million, the case sensationally fell apart last month when lawyers for the Iraqis admitted there was no evidence in a central claim – that insurgents were murdered. It provoked outrage that British troops were accused of the most serious crimes by publicly-funded lawyers. Neil Garnham QC, of Treasury Solicitors, which represented many UK personnel, said evidence of mistreatment by the Iraqis could not be trusted because they had persistently ‘lied and exaggerated’. Their allegations, including claims they were beaten, faced mock executions and witnessed captives being stabbed, were ‘implausible, confused and inconsistent’, he added. The Iraqis were involved in a . ‘deliberate and co-ordinated attempt... to deceive the inquiry’ into . believing UK troops had tortured and killed prisoners’, he said. The . Ministry of Defence’s closing submissions said the claims had caused . soldiers’ ‘immense anxiety and distress’. It . added: ‘The untruthful allegations cannot be attributed to honest . mistakes or misunderstandings. They are the product of a conspiracy . between a number of the Iraqi core participants to pervert the course of . justice.’ British troops leave Basra Palace in Iraq at the end of the last day of combat operations after the hand over of military control in Basra to the United States in 2009. An inquiry has heard how Iraqis conspired to claim that British soldiers tortured prisoners to secure substantial compensation payouts . A British Army soldier runs across a street during a foot patrol in the southern Iraqi city of Basra. The Al Sweady inquiry has heard how Iraqis conspired to claim that British troops executed and tortured prisoners to secure huge compensation payouts . It admitted there were ‘some instances’ where British soldiers had fallen short of expected standards, such as a detainee being shouted at, slapped and being restrained incorrectly. But lawyers for the Iraqis said there were still numerous ‘grave’ claims of abuse for the inquiry to consider. Patrick O’Connor QC said: ‘They are gross violations of the Geneva Conventions, inhuman and degrading treatment of wounded, broken and helpless young men, who were utterly at the mercy of their military handlers and interrogators.’ The Iraqis allege troops from the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders took bloody revenge for the massacre of six Royal Military policemen a year earlier. The MoD insists the men were insurgents killed in battle. Mr Shiner’s Birmingham-based Public Interest Lawyers has received around £3million in public money for the inquiry, named after Hameed Al Sweady, 19, who died in the incident. His firm made its name pursuing British soldiers through the courts over alleged war crimes in Iraq.

"The father of Lee Rigby yesterday denounced a decision to hand his son’s murderers more than £200,000 in legal aid. Phil McClure, 53, said it was ‘disgusting’ that the soldier’s killers, Michael Adebolajo, 29, and Michael Adebowale, 23, had been granted handouts for their three-month trial at the Old Bailey last year. He hit out at the justice system as it emerged that Adebolajo is continuing to challenge his conviction and sentence, despite losing the first stage of his appeal. Scroll down for video . Phil McClure (left) - the biological father of Drummer Lee Rigby (right) - has hit out at the justice system after his son's killers received more than £200,000 in legal aid for their three-month trial at the Old Bailey last year . Michael Adebolajo, 29, (left) was given a whole-life jail term for murdering Lee Rigby, while Michael Adebowale, 23, (right) was jailed for life with a minimum of 45 years for the same offence . The Judicial Office has confirmed that a judge refused the Islamic fanatic permission to appeal after he considered the case on paper. But Adebolajo has renewed applications to overturn both his conviction and sentence. His case will now be considered before a panel of Court of Appeal judges. His continuing appeal is likely to land the taxpayer with even higher legal bills. Last night MPs called on the Lord Chancellor to prevent taxpayers’ money being used for ‘jihadi grandstanding’. Mr McClure, a lorry driver from Oldham, is still coming to terms with the death of his 25-year-old son, who was murdered in Woolwich, South-East London, on May 22 last year. The father of one had been returning to military barracks when Adebolajo and Adebowale used their car to knock him over before hacking him to death in front of horrified onlookers. Adebolajo, who was sentenced in February to a whole-life term, received £138,803 in legal aid. Adebowale, who was jailed for life with a minimum term of 45 years for his role in the murder, received £73,809.36. The pair had their defence funded by the public, despite the judge making it clear Adebolajo had no legal defence and Adebowale refused to take the stand. The total bill for barristers and solicitors was £212,613, according to Ministry of Justice figures. But that figure is likely to grow as Adebolajo has been given the go-ahead to renew his case and Adebowale has been given leave to challenge his sentence.

There wasn’t even a defence – they were on camera boasting about killing Lee. The system needs to change.’ The killers lay in wait near Woolwich Barracks and picked Fusilier Rigby because he was wearing a Help for Heroes hooded top and carrying a camouflage rucksack. Neither has shown any remorse. Tory MP Rob Wilson said: ‘This is about getting attention around the world for their vile deeds. I will be writing to the Lord Chancellor to see if there is any action we can take to stop these revolting people from abusing our system.’ His comments follow a call by Tory MP David Nuttall for a Commons debate on payments in ‘hopeless’ appeals used to promote a terrorist agenda.

"Nick Clegg fractured the Coalition’s unity over defeating Islamic State yesterday by warning he will block any bid to bomb jihadi bases in Syria. The Liberal Democrat leader indicated he would not allow David Cameron to call a fresh Commons vote on expanding the RAF’s current campaign targeting the terrorists in Iraq. Until now, the Coalition has presented a united front on dealing with IS. But Mr Clegg rejected early action in Syria, where jihadis have murdered four Western hostages, including British aid workers Alan Henning and David Haines. Scroll down for video . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said he would not support airstrikes against ISIS in Syria, despite backing action in Iraq . His stance alarmed senior Tories, who had believed that Ed Miliband was the main barrier to Britain joining the international fight against IS as it relentlessly spreads its poisonous tentacles from its Syrian heartland. A senior Tory source said: ‘Clegg seems to have shifted. The question is whether it is just a shift to get him through his party conference, or something more serious.’ Former Tory defence minister Sir Gerald Howarth accused Mr Clegg of being ‘utterly irresponsible’. He added: ‘Clegg is all over the place on this. He said we must do all in our power to stop these brutal killings, yet now he’s saying that we won’t do all in our power.’ Former defence secretary Liam Fox said: ‘It is very clear that the Lib Dems are willing to have us fight IS with one hand tied behind our back, allowing these murderers to retreat behind an imaginary line in the sand. This is a desperate Lib Dem leader playing to the gallery rather than standing up for the national interest.’ HMS Defender has been deployed to protect the US Navy carrier task group in the Gulf, using its 'world-class air defence weapon systems', as part of the international coalition against ISIS . Tory ministers have been agitating for a fresh Commons vote to authorise military action against IS in Syria. But Mr Clegg told the BBC’s Andrew Marr show: ‘I wouldn’t advocate that we extend the air campaign into Syria. That’s why we didn’t do it last week.’ Asked whether there would be a fresh vote on Syria, he added: ‘No, well it won’t come to a vote unless the Government proposes it, and what I’m saying is the Government is not proposing it right now. ‘We need to persuade the British people, indeed Parliament as well, that every time we put servicemen and servicewomen in harm’s way, we do so with a clear strategy in mind. ‘And I think the combination of air strikes and ground forces needs to be properly thought through. That was obvious in Iraq. It’s a little bit more complicated in Syria.’ Aides to Mr Clegg said the Lib Dems were not opposed to air strikes on IS in Syria by the US and Arab countries but would not back British involvement until there was a credible Syrian opposition able to take the fight to IS on the ground – and that could take years. Former Chief of the Defence Staff Lord Richards said tackling IS in Syria was a ‘no-brainer’, as it was impossible to defeat it by focusing only on its operations in Iraq. He added that ‘thousands’ more British troops should be recruited to fight Islamic terrorism around the world. Lord Richards, who stood down as head of the armed forces last year, said: ‘You either have to put your own boots on the ground at some point or else you have to very energetically and aggressively train up those who will do that with us and for us. My worry at the moment is that the scale of the challenge isn’t being met by the right scale of response. MPs backed Government plans to join air strikes against ISIS in Iraq by 524 to 43, majority 481, after more than six hours of debate in an emergency recall of Parliament last month . ‘I am worried that without more intensive use of Western boots on the ground in a support role then we won’t do it in the time we need to get on and do this in.’ Relatives and friends of Mr Henning, murdered by IS last week, accused the Government of doing too little to try to secure his freedom and that of Mr Haines, who was beheaded last month. Mr Henning’s brother-in-law, Colin Livesey, 47, said: ‘They could have done more when they knew about it months and months ago. Just the same with David Haines – I don’t think they did enough for him either.’ Lord Richards played down expectations that the SAS would be able to hunt down the hostage killers in Syria, saying: ‘As good as the SAS are, they are also rightly very cautious and I think to expect them to do that is a tall order and it needs to be part of this grander strategy.’","Lib Dem leader said he 'wouldn't advocate' attacks against ISIS in Syria .

"Karen Buck has received a complaint from one of her constituents after sending him an Eid card despite the fact that he is not a Muslim . A Labour MP has infuriated one of her constituents by twice sending him a card celebrating an Islamic festival even though he is not a Muslim. Karen Buck, a key aide to party leader Ed Miliband, admitted that her staff went through the electoral register picking out people with ‘Islamic’ names – a practice that could be in breach of the Data Protection Act. Rustom Irani, 52, who was born into the ancient Iranian faith of Zoroastrianism, first complained when he received an Eid card from her in 2009. The Westminster North MP apologised and promised him it would not happen again – but then she sent him another greeting to mark the Islamic feast day at the beginning of the week. Mr Irani, a businessman from Maida Vale, West London, said the Labour politician’s use of his personal information raised data protection concerns. ‘I was born a Zoroastrian,’ he said. ‘I’m not anti-Islamic, it’s just that I’m not Muslim. Clearly they have just looked up my name.’ Miss Buck told Mr Irani in 2009 that the 7,000 cards she sent out that year to mark Eid – which celebrates the end of Ramadan, the Islamic month of fasting – were intended only for Muslims, although she confirmed at least two other recipients had complained. ‘My offices have no special access to data on resident’s religion,’ she wrote. ‘We made an error on the basis of your surname being an Islamic one. ‘For this I again sincerely apologise. The vast majority of the cards sent out via surnames on the electoral register were sent to Muslim households and were welcomed.’ Following a complaint by Mr Irani, Miss Buck was warned by the Information Commissioner’s Office in 2010 that she had probably breached the Data Protection Act and should not send any more Eid cards to constituents ‘merely on the basis of an assumption about their names’. Scroll down for video . Karen Buck, who is Parliamentary Private Secretary to Ed Miliband, got a complaint from the same man in 2010. On that occasion she was warned that she had likely breached data protection rules . Mr Irani, whose name is of expatriate Zoroastrian origin, said: ‘The mistake shouldn’t have been made again.’ Miss Buck, who is Mr Miliband’s Parliamentary Private Secretary, said she believed constituents welcome the Christmas, Eid and Rosh Hashanah [Jewish New Year] cards she sends each year. But Tory MP Philip Davies said: ‘The idea that you can win elections by this kind of vacuous, politically correct, cynical tactic is wrong. ‘I rather hope that elections are determined by what you believe in and what you do for your local community.

"Ballon d'Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo has ended his relationship with Irina Shayk after the she refused to attend his mother's 60th birthday party according to a newspaper in Portugal. Coreio de Manhana reported that Shayk had told Ronaldo that she would not be attending the bash in his native Madeira, and the ensuing row served to end the pair's five-year romance. As a parting dig to Ronaldo, the Russian model has now stopped following him on Twitter. Ronaldo and Shayk reportedly split because the Russian model refused to attend his mother's birthday . Family man: Cristiano was accompanied by his mother, Maria Dolores dos Santos Aveiro on stage . A source told Coreio de Manhana: 'Cristiano wanted to surprise his mum and as he spent Christmas with Irina in Dubai, he had planned to be with his mum on her birthday, but Irina didn't want to go. 'They had such a big row that he ended up spending New Years Eve alone with his son. 'Irina mouthed off about Dolores and Ronaldo took sides with him mum. It was the straw that broke the camel's back because they had hadn't been getting on well in the last few months.' Ronaldo takes part in a training session ahead of Real Madrid's game with Getafe on January 18 . Real Madrid are currently top of La Liga with 42 points, one more than second placed Barcelona . Ronaldo has won the Ballon d'Or for the third time in his career and for the second consecutive year . The newspaper also claimed Irina decided to stay in a hotel during one of her recent trips to Madrid because Dolores, who watched proudly as her son won his third Ballon d'Or on Monday, was at Cristiano's luxury home on the exclusive estate La Finca. 'Dolores thinks Irina wasn't the right woman for Ronaldo's son,' the source continued. 'She wanted someone who would, in the future, assume the role of mum for Cristiano Jr. That wasn't a priority for Irina.' Along with Dolores, Cristiano is raising four-year-old son Cristiano Jr, whose mother's identity has been fiercely guarded by the sportsman. Cristiano's mother, Dolores, didn't believe that Irina was a suitable mother figure for her grandson . Irina's dramatic Twitter unfollow came after she failed to support Ronaldo in Zurich on Monday when he was awarded the prestigious FIFA Ballon d'Or award. Cristiano also noticeably failed to mention Irina's name during his acceptance speech. 'It's an unforgettable moment in my life to win the Ballon d'Or for the third time,' Ronaldo said after claiming football's most prestigious individual award for the second consecutive year. 'I feel extremely happy and proud to receive this award and I want to keep challenging myself every day. 'I have to thank my family, all the people who support me and also my colleagues of Real Madrid and Portuguese National team that make me a better player every day.' Irina was by Ronaldo's side when he collected the prestigious Ballon d'Or award in 2013 . According to Irina's PR representative, the model did not attend the annual FIFA Ballon d'Or awards because she simply had other commitments. '[The Ballon d'Or] didn't fit in with her schedule,' a spokesperson told Goal.com. 'It was because of work commitments. We have no further comment to make.' However, some have raised doubts over the explanation as the awards ceremony had been in the calendar for 12 months in advance. Suspicious fans have also questioned why Irina did not bother to congratulate her estranged boyfriend on any of her social networking accounts either. Irina has been posting pictures of a recent winter getaway on Twitter without Ronaldo . Irina has posted plenty of bikini shots on her Instagram and Facebook pages over the past few days . Rather than congratulating him on his impressive achievement, she instead chose to post pictures of herself on a winter getaway to a mysterious location, where she celebrated her 29th birthday.

"An MI5 agent praised by Tony Blair for playing a key role in the UK’s war on terror is suing the Government after being told that he can no longer live in Britain. The 33-year-old Moroccan-born agent worked for MI5 for six years, risking his life to prevent terror attacks on the UK. He infiltrated Islamic extremist cells and worked on investigations into the 7/7 attacks on London and the Madrid bombings as well as providing intelligence which led to the arrest of Al Qaeda terror suspects. Danger: The agent leaves court with his face hidden by a hood and goggles following his 2003 arrest in Belgium . Now the Home Office has told him he has no right to remain in Britain because ministers say he has a criminal record. His case is due to be heard at a high-profile immigration hearing in May, where MI5 has been asked to give evidence. The agent, who married a British citizen with whom he has a five-year-old daughter, says he faces arrest and torture in his home country of Morocco if forced to leave. The man left Morocco when he was 15 and arrived in Britain three years later. He stayed in Finsbury Park Mosque where he met radical preacher Abu Hamza, whose followers sent him to Georgia and then Chechnya. According to legal papers seen by The Mail on Sunday, he claims that when he returned from Georgia to the UK in 2000 he was approached by MI5 and recruited as an agent. In December 2001 he was sent on a mission to Belgium to infiltrate an extremist cell but was arrested by Belgian security services. Terror: The number 30 double-decker bus which was destroyed in Tavistock Square, London, when a suicide bomber detonated his backpack bomb . He was held in solitary confinement without charge for two years before being convicted for associating with terrorists and possessing a false travel document. But in January 2004, when he faced a further two years in prison, he claims he was visited by an MI5 officer who told him then-Home Secretary David Blunkett had authorised his transfer to Britain. He claims he was offered the choice of remaining in prison in Belgium, returning to Morocco – where he faced arrest and torture – or continuing his work for MI5. The agent arrived in Britain in April on a specially chartered jet and immediately began training with MI5, including how to use fake documents and infiltrate extremist groups. He provided vital intelligence on the detonation system used by the terrorists in the 2004 Madrid bombings and helped track down extremists linked to the bombers in the 7/7 attacks in 2005. He was also sent on a mission to Ireland to infiltrate a suspected Al Qaeda cell. For this work he claims he was repeatedly told by MI5 that David Blunkett and Tony Blair were very pleased and that Mr Blair had personally made use of the intelligence he gathered from extremist groups. But in February 2006 MI5 summoned him to a meeting in a hotel in Surrey, where he was told the relationship was being terminated because he was no longer any use to them. He was offered a £10,000 bribe to leave the UK for Morocco and says in his legal claim that he chose to stay in the UK because he was promised he would be granted permanent residency if he remained. But he alleges that since he left MI5 he has been betrayed, with MI5 refusing to return his calls and the Home Office rejecting his claims for residency. He says this has caused his marriage to end. Last night David Blunkett denied he had any knowledge of the case. The man’s Belgian lawyer, Christophe Marchand, said he ‘believed he had no choice’ but to work for MI5.","Morrocan-born agent infiltrated extremist cells on behalf of British spies .

"A Christian bakery owner who refused to make a cake with a slogan supporting gay marriage insists he will not back down, even if he is taken to court. Ashers Baking Company - based in Northern Ireland and named after a verse in the Bible - has been warned by the Equality Commission that the law does not allow them to turn down an order to bake the cake. But general manager Daniel McArthur said his company would not be baking the cake under any circumstances, insisting that Christians should be able to apply their beliefs to the day-to-day running of their businesses. Ashers bakers, in Belfast, who refused to bake a gay rights cake are to be taken to court by the state equality watchdog . In the past the courts have said it is wrong for Christians to refuse to serve gay people on grounds of their sexuality. Judges have also said it is right for Christians to be fired from their jobs for refusing to take part in same-sex civil partnership ceremonies or for saying they would not give sex therapy to same-sex couples. But the challenge to the Christian-run Ashers Baking Company is the first likely legal case in which anyone has been told it is against the law to refuse to take part in gay rights publicity campaigns. Despite the threat of legal action, the business' owner insists he will not go against his beliefs. Mr McArthur said: 'I would like the outcome of this to be that any Christians running a business could be allowed to follow their Christian beliefs and principles in the day-to-day running of the business and that they are allowed to make decisions based on that.' The new clash between gay rights and Christian convictions began in May when an activist from the QueerSpace pressure group approached the Belfast bakery chain and ordered a cake decorated with the words ‘support gay marriage’. The design also included the organisation’s name and two characters from Sesame Street. The order from the activist, Gareth Lee, was accepted by shop staff. However, the owners of the family-run company, Colin and Karen McArthur, and their son Daniel, who is manager, decided the message on the cake was contrary to their beliefs. Mrs McArthur phoned Mr Lee to tell him the firm would not bake the cake, and to offer a refund. The bakers have in the past refused to produce cakes showing sexual images or featuring bad language. The new clash between gay rights and Christian convictions began in May when an activist from the QueerSpace pressure group approached the Belfast bakery chain and ordered a cake decorated with the words 'support gay marriage' Mr Lee complained to the Equality . Commission’s Northern Ireland branch, which warned the bakers that they . now face a legal claim. A . letter from the Commission said: ‘We have advised Mr Lee that you have . acted unlawfully and contrary to Regulation Five of the Equality Act . (Sexual Orientation) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2006 which prohibits . discrimination in the provision of goods, facilities and services to a . person seeking or obtaining to use those goods, facilities or services . on the grounds of sexual orientation.’ It said county court proceedings would start within seven days of the letter. The threat follows attempts by public sector organisations to compel staff to accept gay rights policies. In . one case, that of Adrian Smith, demoted by Trafford Housing Trust for a . message on his private Facebook page calling same-sex marriage ‘an . equality too far’, the Trust was told by the High Court to back down and . Mr Smith’s right to free speech was vindicated. However, Mr Smith won . only £100 compensation. The Sexual Orientation Regulations, pushed through by Tony Blair despite a rebellion by Labour Cabinet members who thought they threatened free expression, have always been taken to mean that businesses may not refuse to serve gay customers. In this case, Mr Lee was turned down not because of his sexual orientation but because of the provocative nature of the cake he wanted baked. The bakery is now to be backed in court by the Christian Institute pressure group. The Institute lent support to Peter and Hazelmary Bull, the Cornwall hoteliers who lost a legal battle after they refused a room to a gay couple on the grounds that they were not married. The Supreme Court judge who made the final decision in the case, Lady Hale, has now said she believes the judgement against the Bulls was too harsh and that the law should allow Christians a ‘conscience clause.’ Mr Lee complained to the Equality Commission's Northern Ireland branch, which warned the bakers that they now face a legal claim . Christian Institute chief Colin Hart said: ‘The Government repeatedly failed to listen to members of the public, lawyers, constitutional experts, even its own MPs when they called for safeguards to protect those who back traditional marriage, especially those who work in the public sector. ‘Now this nonsense, more usually associated with the public sector, is being applied to the private sector. This means millions of ordinary people who do not agree with gay marriage face intimidation and the real threat of legal action from the forces of political correctness if they, out of conscience, decline to provide good or services to campaign groups they do not agree with or support. ‘It establishes a dangerous precedent about the power of the state over an individual, or business to force them to go against their deeply held beliefs.’ Mr Hart added: ‘The Government must take urgent action to address this injustice by introducing legislation that would introduce reasonable accommodation to protect those who for religious or philosophical reasons believe that marriage is the lifelong union of one man to one woman.’","QueerSpace pressure group approached Belfast bakery chain and ordered a cake decorated with the words ‘support gay marriage’

She met with his relatives while he remains in critical condition from the injuries he sustained in the April 2 beating. 'I go over there and I say, ""Don't nobody else hit him. Don't put your hands on him. Leave him alone!"" And everybody backed up and let me go to work on your dad,' she told them, according to WDIV Detroit. Loving father: Steve Utash pictured with daughter Mandi Marie. He was brutally beaten by a gang . Hoping and praying: A family member holds Steve Utash's hand as he is in a medically-induced coma at a local hospital . She said he was unconscious and 'wasn't doing anything' by the time she got to his side. 'Just her presence, offering aid to this gentleman, may have saved his life,' Chief Craig told the station. Ms Hughes has spoken out on the same day that a fifth man has been arrested for his involvement in attacking the 54-year-old tree trimmer from Clinton Township. Police have not released the person's name, age or any other details. On the mend: David Harris, 10, is expected to make a full recovery after being hit by Steve Utash's vehicle . Attacked: Steve Utash, pictured with wife Starr Utash, is still in a coma after being beaten on April 2 . Three of the five: From left, Wonzey Saffold, 30, James Davis, 24, and Bruce Wimbush Jr., 17, were all charged in the beating and now two others have also been arrested . Arraignments were Tuesday for 17-year-old Bruce Wimbush Jr., 30-year-old Wonzey Saffold and 24-year-old James Davis. They're charged with assault with intent to murder and assault with intent to commit great bodily harm. A 16-year-old boy also faces a hearing Saturday. Steve Utash's son Joseph previously hinted it might have been a setup to rob his father, perhaps even a hate crime. 'I think it was all a setup from the gate,' he told CBS Detroit. 'My dad’s been driving up and down Morang for 15, 16 years working for the same company... they know he has money and they robbed him. 'As far as a hate crime, it might be,' he continued. 'You go in Detroit and you’re white, you don’t belong.' Devastated: Felicia Utash, pictured with Steve, says her father was only trying to do the right thing . Family man: Utash is a married father of two children - the relatives pictured are not identified . Police initially said a group of at least six people descended on Utash, a tree-trimmer. Sgt. Michael Woody said Monday that investigators are 'not trying to stick to one specific number' as they receive more tips and other information. 'We wouldn't have been able to get as far as we have' without help from the public, Woody said, though he added, 'We're not done yet. We're still very much at the beginning stages of this case.' The case has outraged the public, clergy and elected officials. Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan called the attack 'senseless.' A prominent black minister, the Rev. Horace Sheffield III, had said Saturday that it was important for community members 'to prove that we equally deplore justice and unbridled brutality no matter what color the victim is or of the one committing it.' In . Michigan, ethnic intimidation is a felony that carries a possible . two-year prison sentence.

Moment of impact: Mr Utash hits David Harris just after the boy ran into the street . On the ground: The young boy is crumpled in heap on the ground just after being hit . Prosecutor Kym Worthy said in a statement Monday that the case is 'unbelievably tragic,' but declined further comment 'because this investigation is continuing and widening.' Security footage from a gas station Harris and friends were standing in front of shows him inexplicably running into oncoming traffic before being mowed down by Utash's vehicle. Utash, from suburban Roseville, immediately stopped to check on the boy, but several black males from their late teens to their early 20s quickly descend on the scene. Police quickly ruled the incident an accident. 'It was determined that the driver of the vehicle wouldn't have had any chance of stopping,' Moreno explained.","Deborah Hughes saw a mob gathering around Steve Utash at the gas station across the street from her Detroit home on April 2 .

"Rapist: Gintas Burinskas, has had his 'lenient' sentence extended to life in prison . A convicted rapist who carried out a 'brutal' sex attack on a woman one month after arriving in the UK from Lithuania has had his 'unduly lenient' prison term overturned and replaced with a life sentence. Gintas Burinskas, 36, dragged a woman off a street in Northampton and violently assaulted her just four months after he completed he was released from 10-year jail prison sentence in his home country for rape. Last April, he pleaded guilty to rape and  grievous bodily harm at Northampton Crown Court and was handed another 10-year sentence. But Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas and two other judges increased the original jail term during a hearing at the Court of Appeal. They agreed with submissions made on behalf of Attorney General Dominic Grieve that the sentence was unduly lenient. Today, Lord Thomas announced the court had quashed the original sentence, replacing it with a life sentence with a minimum term of six years. He said: 'This was a very serious, sustained, brutal attack by a very dangerous man on a vulnerable woman at night.' Giving details of the offences, Lord Thomas said Burinskas, who was released from prison in Lithuania in August, 2012, walked up behind his victim and grabbed her round the throat. The judge said: 'He put his hands around her neck and squeezed her throat. She fought him, and shouted, but he increased the pressure on her throat and she lost consciousness. 'She came to and started shouting again. The offender squeezed her throat again and she lost consciousness for a second time. 'When she next regained consciousness she was on the ground in an area surrounded by trees and bushes.' Extended: Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas and two other judges increased the original sentence during a hearing at the High Court . As she tried to push him off 'he hit her repeatedly to the face and grabbed her by the throat yet again', Lord Thomas. During the attack she pleaded with him to stop, and after she tried to run away he caught her and kicked her to the ground. Lord . Thomas added: 'He then kicked her to the head some four or five times, . he stamped on her body and punched her to the stomach. He then dragged . her across the road and tipped alcohol over her.' He said the victim suffered fractures to her jaw and lost two teeth. Surgery was needed for the damage to her jaw and face. The woman was 'devastated' by the incident and thought 'she was going to die'. Previous hearing: The Lithuanian was given a 10-year sentence for rape at Northampton Crown Court last year . Criticism: Attorney General Dominic Grieve believed sentence orginally handed to the Lithuanian sentence was unduly lenient . Lord Thomas added: 'We are satisfied that the seriousness of this offence is such as to justify the imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment.' Michael Ellis, MP for Northampton North, told Mail Online: 'I said when this sentence was passed that it was too lenient. 'But the judges have clearly considered the sentence was far too low, and they were right to increase it. A life sentence is wholly appropriate for this heinous crime and I am pleased to see the process has worked in this instance. 'We must now do everything we can to stop people who have offended abroad  from entering this country.' It is believed Burinskas came to . Northampton in November 2012 to visit a family member. He has previously . served a total of 19 years behind bars in Lithuania. In most instances, EU rules mean . Britain must open its doors to citizens of a fellow EU country, even if . they have a criminal record. But offenders who pose a ‘serious risk’ – . such as a rapist – can be turned away by border officials. Lithuania, like other EU member . states, has given an undertaking to warn if a dangerous individual may . be travelling to the UK. Last night it remained unclear if the . Lithuanians had complied with that undertaking or not. In January last year, Lithuanian . builder Rimvydas Liorancas battered a Birmingham couple to death at . their home after slipping in to the country unnoticed despite . convictions for armed robbery and other offences in his homeland.","Gintas Burinskas, 36, assaulted a woman after drinking in Northampton .

"The debate about climate change is distracting us from the true causes of flooding, a group of eminent scientists warned yesterday. Concreting over flood plains, cutting down trees and expanding cities is making flooding much worse – and we need to act on that knowledge, they said. The exact link between global warming and flooding is much less certain, and those who keep pursuing the topic are taking attention away from the true problem of over-development, they said in a research paper. Over-development: Building on flood plains, cutting down trees and the expansion of cities are to blame for flooding, eminent scientists have claimed . Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured left, claimed global warming was to blame for the floods but Environment Secretary Owen Paterson, pictured right, refused to endorse Cameron's views . David Cameron ignited a row at the height of the recent UK floods by proclaiming that he ‘very much’ suspected the devastation had been caused by climate change. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson refused to endorse the Prime Minister’s views and the Met Office said there was no evidence that the winter floods had been caused by man-made global warming. The 19 scientists, from prestigious universities and institutes in Britain, the US, Japan, Australia and across Europe, said that while greenhouse gas emissions are ‘strongly linked’ to flooding, there is insufficient evidence to accurately describe the connection. They said that until there is firm evidence about the role of climate change, it is better to concentrate on what we do know – that the way we are changing our physical landscape is making flooding worse. Many of the authors, all respected climate change scientists, have contributed to UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports. They include Professor Nigel Arnell, from Reading University’s department of meteorology, Robert Muir-Wood, a  London-based consultant who advises the OECD and UN. Scientists claim there is no firm evidence to link climate change to flooding. Much of the UK was affected by floods in December, including Cookham, Berkshire, after the River Thames burst its banks and flooded homes and gardens worth millions . The paper, published in the Hydrological Sciences Journal yesterday, says: ‘There is such a furore of concern about the linkage between greenhouse forcing [the process by which man-made greenhouse gases are said to force climate change] and floods that it causes society to lose focus on the things we already know for certain about floods and how to mitigate and adapt to them. ‘Blaming climate change for flood losses . makes flood losses a global issue that appears to be out of the control . of regional or national institutions. 'The scientific community needs to emphasize that the problem of flood losses is mostly about what we do on or to the landscape and that will be the case for decades to come.’ The authors say we know there is a clear link between population density and flooding. Millions of houses and businesses have been built on flood plains, meaning that when rivers burst their banks the water flows onto roads and concrete, rather than bare earth. When it cannot soak into the ground it causes untold damage. Cutting down trees – which take up water – exacerbates the problem, as does changing the course of rivers for irrigation and to make way for more developments. But the authors say that when it comes to climate change they had only ‘low confidence’ in models that try to forecast the impact on flooding. Different solution: Scientists are calling for governments to look at the way changing physical landscapes is causing flooding, pictured near Langport in Somerset . ‘The linkages between enhanced greenhouse forcing and flood phenomena are highly complex and it has not been possible to describe the connections well, either by empirical analysis or by the use of models,’ they say. But they add: ‘It is clear that current trends in human activity on the landscape continue to cause an increase in flood damages. ‘Decreasing or reversing this trend will require substantial attention from governments, private citizens, scientists and engineers, and the actions needed to accomplish this are largely the same regardless of the nature of the greenhouse gas-flood linkage.’ Bob Ward, policy director at the London School of Economics Grantham Institute, disagreed, warning that talking about climate change is vital to the debate. ‘Four of the five wettest years on record in the UK have all occurred since 2000, with 2012 being the second wettest, and this winter shaping up to be the wettest ever,’ he said. The row about spending on Britain’s flood defences continued yesterday, when the Committee on Climate Change – the Government’s independent advisory body – said spending shortfalls could lead to £3billion in avoidable damage from a serious flood in future.","Eminent scientists claim over-development is making flooding much worse .

"Defence bosses were last night embroiled in a censorship row over a British soldier’s highly critical book about the war in Afghanistan. The MoD was accused of being paranoid as it made a last-ditch attempt to block publication of a damning study of Britain’s military campaign in Helmand. The 13-year conflict has cost 448 British lives – most of them after Tony Blair ordered troops into the volatile Taliban stronghold in May 2006. Dr Mike Martin (pictured in fatigues above) speaking to an Afghan villager in Helmand Province. Dr Martin served as a Captain in the Territorial Army when he was commissioned to write his book . MoD chiefs actually commissioned . Oxford-educated Territorial Army captain Dr Mike Martin to write about . the mission as part of his PhD. But . his criticism of intelligence blunders and the failure of commanders to . understand the conflict is said to have embarrassed officials. Now . the MoD has asked for the damning account to be pulped, claiming it . breaches the Official Secrets Act and uses classified material uncovered . by Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, which Dr Martin and his publisher . deny. As a result, the 31-year-old author has quit the military in disgust after serving for ten years. Dr Martin interviewed 150 people for his book using fluent Pushtun, the local dialect in the Helmand Province . He . is now pushing ahead with the publication this month of An Intimate . War: An Oral History Of The Helmand Conflict 1978-2012. He spent six . years researching conflict in the province, starting with the Russian . involvement in the Seventies. The . row will fuel speculation that Defence Secretary Philip Hammond is . paranoid about criticism of the MoD. But the book has been praised by . senior military figures and MPs. Major . General Andrew Kennett, who commanded Dr Martin’s unit, said: ‘I think . he has done the Army a great service by writing this.’ Labour . defence spokesman Kevan Jones said: ‘Clearly Philip Hammond’s culture . of paranoia extends to trying to ban books, which is extraordinary.’ Dr Martin (pictured above) explained to the Ministry of Defence that material contained within the book was already in the public domain . General . Sir David Richards, the recently retired head of the Armed Forces, who . commanded international forces in Afghanistan between 2006-07, said the . book was ‘quite simply, the book on Helmand’, adding: ‘I sincerely wish . it had been available to me when I was ISAF Commander in Afghanistan.’ Dr Martin said: ‘I have been forced to resign. I was employed as a . constructive critic and I strongly believe that the Army needs reform.’ His . MoD-funded doctorate was awarded in February 2013 and he told officials . he planned to turn it into a book, with proceeds going to military . charities. But the MoD sat on the manuscript for 14 months, only raising its complaints in February. Dr . Martin said he sent the PhD to the Army and the MoD before it was even . awarded, adding: ‘I told them that I was going to be converting this . into a book. There’s no difference in the content, just the style. British troops boarding a Chinook helicopter in Helmand in 2009 because traveling by road had become so dangerous . The book is highly critical of the naivety of British and American commanders about they way they dealt with the local tribes . In total, 448 British lives have been lost in Afghanistan, including (from top row left to right) Sergeant Nigel Coupe, Corporal Jake Hartley and Private Anthony Frampton, with (bottom row left to right) Private Christopher Kershaw, Private Daniel Wade and Private Daniel Wilford. An inquest heard that the six soldiers were killed when a bomb destroyed their vehicle in Helmand . Dr Martin (pictured above left) was one of the only people in the British army who could speak fluently with locals in Helmand . Dr Martin said he was forced to resign from the Army because of the controversy surrounding his book . Dr Martin conducted 150 interviews in Helmand using the local dialect of Pushtu . Retired Chief of the Defence Staff Sir David Richards praised the book claiming 'I wish it had been available to me' while commander in Afghanistan . Dr Martin claimed that military commanders failed to understand that the Afghan conflict was primarily a tribal civil war . Dr Martin's book - An Intimate War: An Oral History of the Helmand Conflict - details the region's troubled history from 1978 to 2012 . ‘I . heard nothing until February when they said, “You can’t run it”. So I . resigned my commission and we have restarted the print run.’ Dr Martin, from East London, accused MoD officials of trying to protect the reputation of Britain and its US allies. His . book argues that Nato’s ISAF troops failed to understand they were . getting involved in a tribal civil war, rather than a fight against the . Taliban. He said: ‘We often . made the conflict worse, rather than better. This was usually as a . result of the Helmandis manipulating our ignorance.’ Dr . Martin, who conducted 150 interviews in Pashtu, the local language he . speaks fluently, said: ‘The book demonstrates how outsiders have most . often misunderstood the struggle in Helmand and how, in doing so, they . have exacerbated the conflict and made it more violent.’ He and publisher Hurst denied including classified intelligence material in the book. Repeated written requests for clarification on national security breaches were ignored by the MoD, they said. Hurst . managing director Michael Dwyer said: ‘I don’t know why the MoD opposed . it. They said it was something to do with Wikileaks and classified . material so we stopped the print run but when we asked them to elaborate . they refused. I think they’re just embarrassed.’ Yesterday the MoD denied claims it had tried to block the book using the Official Secrets Act. A statement on the MoD's website said the Army accepted classified documents referred to in the book were from public sources so the final decision not to approve publication was not based on the act. It said: 'The MoD is not in any way attempting to prevent the book's publication. 'The Army simply decided that it was inappropriate for a serving officer to publish a book that is so heavily critical of the Army, the MoD and our allies. 'The existing policy on publication of books and articles by serving military personnel is clear and exists to ensure that our operational security and the personal security of our people is protected. It is also designed to protect the hard won reputation of the Armed Forces.' A number of books critical of the campaign have faced MoD censorship. An entire print run of Dead Men Risen, an account of the deployment of the Welsh Guards to Helmand in 2009, was pulped on the ground of national security. The MoD eventually erased 50 words from the manuscript. In November, Defence Secretary Mr Hammond was branded 'paranoid' over claims he banned his Labour opposite number from sitting next to one of Britain’s top military chiefs at a dinner. He was accused of ensuring that organisers of an Armed Forces charity dinner tore up their seating plan to separate Shadow Defence Secretary Vernon Coaker from Sir Stuart Peach, the Vice-Chief of the Defence Staff. His aides denied Labour's claim. But he has also been criticised for blocking off-the-record briefings from senior military officers to MPs. An MoD spokesman said: 'The MoD has a strong record of learning from previous campaigns and encourages its officers to challenge existing norms and conventional wisdom. 'However the publication of books and articles by serving military personnel is governed by well-established policy and regulations. When these are breached the MoD will withhold approval.' Former TA captain Dr Mike Martin’s book says Britain failed in Helmand because political and military leaders ‘mischaracterised’ the conflict. His work argues that the Taliban were not the ‘main drivers of violence’. Instead, conflict was driven by Helmandi individuals, including local politicians  and tribal chiefs, and their personal motivations. It is therefore more of a civil war  between clans than a clash between the ‘good’ government of Afghanistan and the ‘bad’ Taliban. In one example, he says that in 2008, the district governor of Nad-e Ali asked British officers to drive the Taliban from the village of Shin Kalay. The village elders appeared pleased, and drank tea with the soldiers. Publisher Michael Dwyer said he intends launching the book as planned despite the objections of the Ministry of Defence . But the  so-called Taliban were a tribal militia  raised by the elders to keep out the district police, who had been raping young boys and stealing. Unfortunately, the British had entered the village with 20 Afghan policemen. It later emerged that the district governor was from the same tribe as the police and a different one to the village elders. Furthermore, the villagers had evicted the district governor in the 1980s when he had then been the chief of police under the communists. Dr Martin said: ‘The British had a very simplistic understanding of the conflict – an understanding that did not chime with how the Helmandis themselves saw the conflict. The insurgency narrative ... meant we often made the conflict worse, rather  than better.’ Dr Martin insists it is vital to learn lessons from the war, launched in 2001 to topple the Taliban, as Britain prepares to end its involvement at the end of the year. Critics have accused Nato of becoming bogged down in Afghanistan because Western leaders had only a ‘primitive understanding’ of its population, tribal culture and geography. Both General Sir Nick Houghton, the Chief of the Defence Staff, and his recently-retired predecessor General Sir David Richards have flagged up British failures when troops were sent to Helmand in May 2006.","Author 'forced to resign' from the Army after Ministry of Defence pulled support for controversial book .

"Yahoo boss Carol Bartz has been fired as the company's chief executive after the ailing internet firm lost further ground to main rival Google. Miss Bartz, who was axed by phone, has had a rocky tenure lasting nearly three years punctuated by stagnating growth and a bitter row with one of the firm's Chinese partners. The 63-year-old CEO, who was hired despite a lack of internet or advertising experience, told Yahoo employees that she was fired by Yahoo's chairman of the board, Roy Bostock. Rocky road: Carol Bartz has had three years in charge punctuated by stagnating growth and a bitter row with one of the firm's Chinese partners . Most recently, Yahoo have settled a payment dispute with China's Alibaba Group, in which Yahoo holds a 40 per cent stake. Miss Bartz has also had to watch as Yahoo loses further ground as an internet domain to all-conquering Google, while also facing strong competition from other social networks like Facebook. She announced her departure to employees via a two-sentence email from her iPad which read: 'I am very sad to tell you that I've just been fired over the phone by Yahoo's Chairman of the Board. 'It has been my pleasure to work with all of you and I wish you only the best going forward.' The California-based company has appointed chief financial officer Timothy Morse as CEO on an interim basis, but plans to search for a permanent replacement for Miss Bartz. At its peak in 2000, Yahoo shares traded for $125. Last night they closed at $12.91. Yahoo lost further ground in the race against Google during Miss Bartz's tenure, despite actually making more money through layoffs, service closures and other cost-cutting moves. Last year Yahoo's revenue edged up by . just two per cent in the first nine months of the year, while Google's . climbed by 23 per cent in the same period. Media moguls: Ms Bartz, far right, attends a CEO summit in Washington alongside Sir Richard Branson, Michael Capellas, president of Compaq, Steve Ballmer, president and CEO of Microsoft, and Bill Gates . In April the same year, the straight-talking boss candidly admitted that she 'could have done better' in her job, by which time speculation around her position was already growing. Facebook has also become another serious competitor for Yahoo by attracting the major marketing partners which once went to Yahoo during the dotcom boom in 2000. Jan '09: . Bartz appointed Yahoo CEO, replacing co-founder Jerry Yang, who . resigned under pressure from investors after rejecting a Microsoft . takeover bid. July '09: Yahoo and Microsoft seal ten-year search engine merger deal in attempt to rival Google. April 2010: Bartz admits she, along with 100 other executives at Yahoo, 'could have done better'. Sept 2010: Yahoo's revenue growth for first nine months of year is 11 times less than that of Google. Dec 2010: The firm's poor financial growth forces Bartz to lay off between 600 and 700 employees. Feb 2011: Yahoo is valued at around $22.11bn, while Google is worth $169.38bn. May 2011: Row between Yahoo and Chinese partner Alibaba sees U.S. firm lose part of its 40 per stake in Asian company. The firm was forced to lay off more than 600 staff - around five per cent of its workforce - last year due to lacklustre growth. The departure was first reported by the Wall Street Journal's All Things D technology blog. Yahoo shares jumped 74 cents, or 5.7 per cent, to $13.65 in after-hours trading, around 12 per cent higher than they were when Miss Bartz was named chief executive. In recent months speculation has mounted over various companies wanting to either take over Yahoo or invest and split into parts. News Corp, AT&T, and Verizon had all been linked with a move to buy the firm out, with Yahoo's cooperation. Miss Bartz had joined Yahoo as the firm's CEO after 17 years at design software company Autodesk. Roy Bostock, chairman of the Yahoo board, had publicly backed Bartz earlier this year, but has since decided to let her go after the firm posted more disappointing financial results. Mr Bostock said: 'The board sees enormous growth opportunities on which Yahoo! can capitalize, and our primary objective is to leverage the Company's leadership and current business assets and platforms to execute against these opportunities. 'We have talented teams and tremendous resources behind them and intend to return the Company to a path of robust growth and industry-leading innovation.' Embattled: The Californian internet firm has lost ground in the past two years to Google, while facing stiff competition from Facebook . Mr Bostock also thanked Miss Bartz for her service to Yahoo during 'a critical time of transition in the company's history, and against a very challenging macro-economic backdrop'. Mr Morse said: 'It is an honor to be selected for this role and lead the Company with this world-class team of executives. 'I look forward to working with the Executive Leadership Council and the talented employees of Yahoo!, and to partnering with the Board to invest in the organization and continue to drive its ongoing growth plans.'","Troubled internet firm had lost ground to rivals .

"Saroo before he went missing: In a new book he tells the story of how he got lost a thousand miles from home, then found his way back 25 years later . An Indian man who was lost riding the train aged four then adopted by parents and moved to Australia, only to be reunited with his birth mother 25 years later, has retold his incredible story in a new book. Saroo Brierley from Hobart, Australia, was just another poor boy growing up in rural India, until he accidentally leapt aboard a train that took him a thousand miles away to a strange city. Alone, unable to speak the language, and with no knowledge of where he'd come from, he had to beg to survive until he was rescued by an orphanage and adopted by an Australian family. From then on, he grew up an Australian and enjoyed success in his adoptive country. But he was unable - and unwilling - to forget the land of his childhood. Determined to rediscover his past he embarked on a virtual odyssey of his homeland and, after many hours poring over Google Earth, he managed recognise his home town - and track down his mother. Their reunion in 2012 made headlines across the world, but now he has told his full story in a new book, A Long Way Home, published this week. Like many children growing up in rural India, Saroo rarely had enough to eat and would often travel on trains to beg for scraps with his older brother. But during one ill-fated trip he stopped for a doze at the station with his brother and when he woke up he found that he was alone. 'I opened my eyes and couldn't see my brother, but I saw a train in front of me with the door open and for some reason I thought he was on board,' he said. 'I ran over and jumped on the train just as the doors closed and pulled out of the station, and it was only then that I realised he wasn't there. I think you could say that split-second decision changed my life forever.' Not finding his brother aboard the train, Saroo simply stayed on the train as it made its 1,000 mile journey across the country from Khandwha, Madhya Pradesh, to Calcutta (now Kolkata). He has previously told how he spent a month trying to find his way back, almost drowning in the River Ganges and nearly being abducted by a man who intended to sell him as a slave. Finally, Saroo was rescued from the city streets and put into a juvenile home. Unable to tell carers even where he'd come from, he was transferred to an orphanage, where he was adopted by an Australian couple. He ended up moving to Tasmania where he started a new life with a loving family. He eventually earned a bachelor's degree in business management and joined his adoptive family's engineering firm. But he never gave up hope that he might one day get back to his roots, but with no idea what it was called it seemed an impossible dream. 'I kept in my head the images of the town I grew up in, the streets I used to wander and the faces of my family, I treasured those memories,' he told the Tasmania Mercury. Emotional: Saroo's reunion with his mother, 25 years after he got lost riding the train with his older brother . Determined, he spent years looking at maps for signs of the landmarks that he knew as a child and eventually he turned to Google Earth. Saroo remembered travelling for around 14 hours in the train to Kolkata. Estimating the speed of the train to be about 50mph, he calculated that his hometown could be around 1,000 miles from Kolkata. Saroo then drew a circle on a map with Kolkata at the centre. In an interview with NPR, Saroo described how he singled out his town. He said: 'I thought to myself, ""Well, the first thing you're gonna see before you come to your home town is the river where you used to play with your brothers, and the waterfall, and the architecture of this particular place where you used to visit quite a lot."" It has to be exactly the same, otherwise, if it's not, I'd just fly over and go somewhere else.' 'When I found it, I zoomed on it and bang, it just came up. I navigated it all the way from the waterfall where I used to play,' Saroo told the BBC. Magic moment: Mr Brierley pictured with his mother, Fatima Munshi, when they met for the first time in 25 years . But even after he spotted what he . believed to be the town where he had spent his earliest years, it took . months for Saroo to organise a trip to test out his theory. And when he . finally did reach his old home in the town of Ganesh Talai, it was empty. Mr Brierley's book, A Long Way Home, was published this week by Penguin Australia . 'I just thought the worst, I thought perhaps everyone's gone, my whole family's died, they've passed away,' he told NPR. It was then that he had another stroke of luck, as locals began to approach him and ask him his business. He told them his names, and the names of his mother and siblings, and he soon found someone who was able to help. Saroo went on: 'By the time the fourth person had come, they said, ""Just stay here for a sec,"" and within 10 minutes they came back around and they said, ""Now I'm going to take you to your mother.""' He followed the person just a few yards around a corner, to where three ladies stood at the entrance to a house. One of them was his mother, Fatima. 'I looked at the second one and I thought, 'There's something about you' - and it took me a few seconds but I decrypted what she used to looked like,' he said. 'She looked so much shorter than I remembered when I was a four-year-old child. 'But she walked forward, and I walked forward, and my emotions and tears and the chemical in my brain, you know, it was like a nuclear fusion.' Mr Brierley's book, A Long Way Home, was published this week by Penguin Australia.","Saroo Brierley got lost while riding the train with his brother in rural India .

"'Mockery of justice': Convicted rapist Mustafa Abdullahi cannot be deported to Somalia because it would breach his human rights . A Somali rapist who held a  knife to a pregnant woman’s throat as he raped her has been allowed to stay in Britain to protect his human rights. Mustafa Abdullahi, 31, was jailed for ten years after he threatened to kill his victim and repeatedly assaulted her. He was set to be deported on release, but immigration judges have ruled he cannot be kicked out because his mother and other family members live in the UK. They said he had been here so long, it would breach his right to a private and family life to force him to return to Somalia. The judges also gave him credit for having  ‘faced up to what he has done’ and having put his criminal behaviour ‘behind him’. They also concluded he posed a ‘low risk’ of committing further offences, based on evidence from a psychiatrist who only saw him for a couple of hours. The case is the latest in a series of human rights judgments in which judges favour the rights of criminals over those of victims and the wider public. Tory MP Dominic Raab said: ‘This vicious man should be on the first plane back to Somalia. It makes a mockery of British justice and human rights to see such a dangerous thug dance rings around the UK system.’ Abdullahi came to Britain aged 11 in February 1993 to join his mother, brother and sister, who arrived three years earlier. They were all given indefinite leave to stay in 2000. But in 2007 he was sentenced to ten years in prison for the horrific sex attack, in which he repeatedly raped a ‘vulnerable’ pregnant woman in her early twenties who had been sleeping at her home, after holding a knife to her throat and threatening to kill her. Despite the evidence against him he refused to accept his guilt, forcing his victim to go through the ordeal of a trial. Even while in jail he refused to admit what he had done. When the Home Office began efforts to deport him, he immediately claimed asylum. This application was rejected last year, by which time he was out of prison after serving half his sentence. But Abdullahi’s lawyers appealed against his deportation on human rights grounds. Earlier this year, a Home Office lawyer told a tribunal Abdullahi should be deported because of the ‘very serious and disgusting nature of his offence’. The Home Office pointed out that even after he was released from prison he continued to show ‘no respect for the law’. For example, while on probation, he was caught using cannabis but instead of being returned to jail, he was given a £60 fine. Abdullahi said he was ‘afraid’ to return to the Somaliland region because of the civil war.  He claimed that he wasn’t a practising Muslim, despite having ‘Allah’ tattooed in Arabic on his arm and chest. And because his parents had never taught him about the clan structure in Somalia, he would also struggle to fit in, he said. The tribunal accepted that because he had tattoos, which are considered un-Islamic in Muslim countries, he would be ‘vulnerable to serious harassment’, but concluded it was safe for him to return. Legal row: Abdullahi immediately claimed asylum when the Home Office, pictured, began efforts to deport him . However, they then allowed him to stay because of his right to a private and family life under Article 8 of the Human Rights Act. Despite not having any children or a wife in Britain, they said it would be wrong to send him home because of the length of time he has lived in Britain. The judges also decided he could stay because of his ‘close relatives’ here and ‘very regular contact with his parent and siblings’. First Tier Tribunal Judge Nadine Finch, sitting in London, said  that even though he did not admit his guilt in prison, he had since owned up and completed a ‘victim empathy’ course while on probation. She concluded it was ‘shame  and fear that he would be disowned by his family’ that meant he did not confess at the time, and attributed his lack of candour to the fact that it was his first time in prison and that the offence was ‘against the sensibilities of his  own community’. Psychiatrist Dr Harriet Hunt-Grubbe said . that Abdullahi would be ‘deprived of the emotional support of his . mother and immediate family if deported to Somaliland’. After speaking to him for just two hours, she said there was only a low risk that he would commit serious sexual or violent crimes. She said he was ‘depressed as a result of possibility of deportation and from witnessing his brother committing suicide’. Sending him to Somalia would also increase his suicide risk because he would be unlikely to have access to the anti-depressants and therapy he receives on the NHS. She concluded that he was a ‘well-loved member of his family and his friendship network and that his deportation would have a negative impact on their own lives’. The Home Office appealed but this was rejected by an Upper Tribunal, which said: ‘Although he has committed serious offences, he has at last faced up to what he has done and has taken significant steps to put behind him that kind of criminal behaviour.’ Abdullahi, of Fulham, South West  London, said: ‘I’m not commenting about the case. You’ll have to speak to my solicitor.’ His aunt, Sali Abdullahi, said he did not want to go back to Somalia because he had ‘no family or friends there and it is dangerous’. A Home Office spokesman said: ‘We are extremely disappointed with the court’s decision and plan to appeal. ‘Those who come to the UK must abide by our laws and if they do not we will seek to remove them. In 2012 we removed more than 4,500 foreign national offenders. ‘For too long the Human Rights Act has been abused by foreign criminals to avoid deportation. 'That’s why we introduced tough new rules to protect the public that are being included in our Immigration Bill.’","Mustafa Abdullahi was jailed for ten years after threatening to kill his victim .

"Gift: Prime Minister David Cameron claims the donations are a mark of Britain's compassion . An Ethiopian farmer has been given legal aid in the UK to sue Britain – because he claims millions of pounds sent by the UK to his country is supporting a brutal regime that has ruined his life. He says UK taxpayers’ money –  £1.3 billion over the five years of the coalition Government – is funding a despotic one-party state in his country that is forcing thousands of villagers such as him from their land using murder, torture and rape. The landmark case is highly embarrassing for the Government, which has poured vast amounts of extra cash into foreign aid despite belt-tightening austerity measures at home. Prime Minister David Cameron claims the donations are a mark of Britain’s compassion. But the farmer – whose case is  set to cost tens of thousands of pounds – argues that huge sums handed to Ethiopia are breaching the Department for International Development’s (DFID) own human rights rules. He accuses the Government of devastating the lives of some of the world’s poorest people rather than fulfilling promises to help them. The case comes amid growing global concern over Western aid propping up corrupt and repressive regimes. If the farmer is successful, Ministers might have to review major donations to other nations accused of atrocities, such as Pakistan and Rwanda – and it could open up Britain to compensation claims from around the world. Ethiopia, a key ally in the West’s war on terror, is the biggest  recipient of British aid, despite repeated claims from human rights groups that the cash is used to crush opposition. DFID was served papers last month by lawyers acting on behalf of ‘Mr O’, a 33-year-old forced to abandon his family and flee to a refugee camp in Kenya after being beaten and tortured for trying to protect his farm. He is not seeking compensation but to challenge the Government’s approach to aid. His name is being withheld to protect his wife and six children who remain in Ethiopia. ‘My client’s life has been shattered by what has happened,’ said Rosa Curling, the lawyer handling the case. ‘It goes entirely against what our aid purports to stand for.’ Mr O’s family was caught in controversial ‘villagisation’ programmes. Under the schemes, four million people living in areas opposed to an autocratic government dominated by men from the north of the country are being forced from lucrative land into new villages. Their land has been sold to foreign investors or given to Ethiopians with government connections. People resisting the soldiers driving them from their farms and homes at gunpoint have been routinely beaten, raped, jailed, tortured or killed. Exodus: The farmer claims villagers are being attacked by troops driving them from their land . ‘Why is the West, especially the UK, giving so much money to the Ethiopian government when it is committing atrocities on my people?’ asked Mr O when we met last year. His London-based lawyers argue that DFID is meant to ensure recipients of British aid do not violate human rights, and they have failed to properly investigate the complaints. Human Rights Watch has issued several scathing reports highlighting the impact of villagisation and showing how Ethiopia misuses aid for political purposes, such as diverting food and seeds  to supporters. Concern focuses on a massive scheme called Protection of Basic Services, which is designed to upgrade public services and is part-funded by DFID. Force: Ethiopian federal riot police point their weapons at protesting students in a square in the country's capital, Addis Ababa . Critics say this cash pays the salaries of officials implementing resettlements and for infrastructure at new villages. DFID officials have not interviewed Mr O, reportedly saying it is too risky to visit the United Nations-run camp in Kenya where he is staying, and refuse to make their assessments public. A spokesman said they could not comment specifically on the legal action but added: ‘It is wrong to suggest that British development money is used to force people from their homes. Our support to the Protection of Basic Services programme is only used to provide healthcare, schooling, clean water and other services.’ Intimidation: Riot police confront a man (not the claimant) near the Tegbareed Industrial College as officers beat rock-throwing students during a demonstration . As he showed me  pictures on his mobile phone of his homeland, the tall, bearded farmer smiled fondly. ‘We were very happy growing up there and living there,’ he said. This was hardly surprising: the lush Gambela region of Ethiopia is a fertile place of fruit trees, rivers and fissures of gold, writes Ian Birrell . That was the only smile when I met Mr O in the Dadaab refugee camp in Kenya last year. He told me how his simple family life had been destroyed in seconds – and how he blames British aid for his misery. ‘I miss my family so much,’ he said. ‘I don’t want to be relying on handouts –  I want to be productive.’ His nightmare began in November 2011 when Ethiopian troops accompanied by officials arrived in his village and ordered everyone to leave for a new location. Men who refused were beaten and women were raped, leaving some infected with HIV. I met a blind man who was  hit in the face and a middle-aged mother whose husband was  shot dead beside her – she still bore obvious the scars from  her own beating and rape by three soldiers. Unlike their previous home, their new village had no food, water, school or health facilities. They were not given farmland and there were just a few menial jobs. ‘The government was pretending it was about development,’ said Mr O, 33. ‘But they just want to push the indigenous people off so they can take our land and gold.’ After speaking out against forced relocations and returning to his village, Mr O was taken to a military camp where for three days he was gagged with a sock in his mouth, severely kicked and beaten with rifle butts and sticks. ‘I thought it would be better  to die than to suffer like this,’ he  told me. Afterwards, like thousands of others, he fled the country; now he lives amid the dust and squalor of the world’s largest refugee camp. He says their land was then given to relatives of senior regime figures and foreign investors from Asia and the Middle East. ‘I am very angry about this aid,’ he said. ‘Britain needs to check what is happening to its money. ‘I hope the court will act to stop the killing, stop the land-grabbing and stop your Government supporting the Ethiopian government behind this.’ As the dignified Mr O said so sagely, what is happening in his country is the precise opposite  of development.","The farmer claims aid is funding a despotic one-party state in his country .

"He lives in Queens, he's neurotic and he lives with his aunt. Of course Spider-Man is Jewish, says British-raised actor Andrew Garfield. The 30-year-old, who grew up in Surrey, has revealed he is convinced the Marvel superhero - like him - has Jewish roots. American-British actor Andrew Garfield poses as he arrives for the premiere of the film The Amazing Spider-Man 2 in Rome . Andrew Garfield, pictured here in the 2012 film Spider-Man, has revealed he is convinced the Marvel superhero - like him - has Jewish roots . Garfield was brought up Jewish and has argued that the character traits of Spidey and his alter ego Peter Parker are an undisputable sign that the character is Jewish. However, it seems he may not take his faith too seriously. The producers of Garfield's film The Amazing Spider-Man . 2, which opens this week, angered the Hasidic population of the New York . neighbourhood of Williamsburg, when they shut down streets to film . during last year's Jewish holiday of Passover. Garfield told Time Out: 'Peter Parker is not a simple dude. He can't just switch off. He never feels like he's doing enough. And Peter suffers from self-doubt. 'He ums and ahs about his future because he's neurotic. He's Jewish. It's a defining feature. He's an over-thinker. It would be much easier if he was a life-saving robot.' He added: 'I hope Jewish people won't mind the cliche, because my father's Jewish. I have that in me for sure. US-born British actor Andrew Garfield on the red carpet as he arrives for the German premiere of The Amazing Spiderman 2 . Rabbis in New York have claimed for years that Spidey was part of 'the tribe' 'He is misunderstood, like Jesus. I don't mind the Jesus parallel for Spider-man. Jesus is an awesome guy. When Pontius Pilate said: ""They say you're the son of God. If you're the son of God tell me."" Jesus was like: ""I know who I am, bitch"".' The star, who now lives in Los Angeles, said: 'Peter (Parker) is not that evolved. Peter wants to tell the world he's a good guy: ""Like me, I'm nice."" 'He's a 19 year-old kid. He's a kid struggling with being misunderstood. We've all been misunderstood. That's universal too. I like being Peter.' Rabbis in New York have claimed for years that Spidey was part of 'the tribe'. Indeed, the character was created in 1962 by Stan Lee, a Jewish-American. He even compared the web-slinger to the biblical figure of David. In the Book of Samuel, King Saul sends soldiers to kill David, who finds a cave and weaves a giant web to hide from them. Lee wrote:  'To me you can wrap all of Judaism up in one sentence, and that is ""Do not do unto others…"" All I tried to do in my stories was show that there's some innate goodness in the human condition. And there's always going to be evil; we should always be fighting evil.'","Garfield argues Spidey's character traits are an undisputable sign .

"Britain remained the greatest magnet for EU migrants and migrants from other non-EU countries – even after other countries opened their doors to workers from Eastern Europe, according to latest official figures yesterday. The UK continued to draw in more than any other country in 2011, when citizens of Poland and fellow eastern nations finally won the right to work in Germany and other wealthy EU nations. The UK accepted 566,044 immigrants, compared to 489,422 who went to Germany, according to Eurostat. The EU statistics arm added that the number coming to this country was twice that who went to France – estimated at just 267,400. The figures cover the first full year of the Coalition, which pledged to reduce net migration to 1990s levels. Net migration is the rise or fall in population after both immigration and emigration have been counted. The promise would mean halving the latest published rates of net migration for the year to June 2013, which show an 182,000 increase. Immigration into Britain hit record highs after 2004, when Poland and seven other Eastern European countries joined the EU. They were given immediate freedom to work in Britain without restrictions by Tony Blair’s government. Only Ireland and Sweden did the same, with the result that more than a million Eastern Europeans came to work in this country while few took jobs in other major EU economies. Germany and others followed Brussels rules and only opened their labour markets to citizens of the Eastern countries seven years after they joined the EU. However, according to Eurostat, although Poles and other Eastern workers did flood into Germany, its immigration totals stayed below those of Britain. ‘The UK reported the largest number of . immigrants in 2011, followed by Germany, Spain, and Italy. These four . member states together accounted for 60.3 per cent of immigrants to EU . states,’ its report said. Migration to Germany went up from 346,200 in 2009 to close to half-a-million two years later. Latest British figures show 503,000 immigrants arrived in the 12 months to June last year. Eurostat also said that Britain gave citizenship to 177,600 immigrants in 2011 – more than any other EU country. Since 2007, the UK has also been the destination of workers escaping the economic crises in Spain, Greece, Portugal and Italy. However, Spain still attracts high numbers from Spanish-speaking Latin America. Passengers arriving at Luton Airport from Romania on the first day since the lifting of travel restrictions .

"The young girl, pictured, was filmed performing sex acts on 24 men . Council officials in Magaluf, Spain have ordered the closure of the bar where a British girl was filmed performing sex acts on 24 men for a cheap cocktail. Local police say they have identified Playhouse as the bar where the video was taken. The owners of the bar have been hit with a £43,500 fine they have been told to pay with controversial entertainment firm Carnage. Both Playhouse and Carnage have also been told they must shut for a year unless they can successfully appeal against the council decision. The pair, formally notified on Thursday of the fine and closure orders, have been given 15 working days to appeal. A council spokesman said: 'The town hall has shown it is acting in a scrupulous legal fashion. 'We’ve acted only when a full and conclusive police report was in place. 'We haven’t acted on the spur of the moment based on the sole evidence of a video posted on the Internet. 'I think the message is clear. The town hall won’t tolerate activities of the kind featured in the video under any circumstances. 'We will use all the laws we have available to us to ensure there is no repetition. 'Playhouse and Carnage now have 15 days to defend themselves and I am sure they will do so because a 12-month closure could make anything think about closing up permanently.' The spokesman added: 'There’s nothing to stop Carnage opening up again under a different name if the council decision prospers. 'But if they chose to do so they’ll have to be aware of what they’re up against. 'A lot of bars and hotels they have been working with might not be so keen to work with them in the future. 'The fine of €55.000 euros is a joint fine they can pay between them but the closure orders affects them both for the full 12 months.' Manuel Onieva, mayor of the municipality of Calvia which covers Magaluf, ordered a police investigation earlier this month after the video of an 18-year-old British holidaymaker performing multiple sex acts on men inside a bar went viral. He spoke of his disgust at the video and warned then bars face closure if they were found to have broken the law. Scroll down for video . Officials were appalled after a video of the young girl performing sex acts on 24 men went viral on the internet . A spokesperson for the local council said they will not tolerate any similar activities in future following the video . The council said it was fining Playhouse and Carnage and closing them down for 12 months because they had failed to comply with laws which made them responsible for ensuring under-age children had not witnessed the sordid events from inside or outside the bar. It also said there had been a clear breach of the law because a pornographic show had taken place in an establishment licenced to operate as a music bar. Council licensing boss Juan Feliu said: 'The law states quite clearly that under-age children cannot participate in or witness pornographic shows. 'Establishments like Playhouse have a responsibility to make sure the law is upheld and we say the bar and Carnage have not adopted all objective measures to guarantee that was the case. 'The sole possibility that there were under-age children present is a more than sufficient reason to sanction according to the law. 'Playhouse has windows for instance and from outside you can see what’s happening inside. 'The police report is very comprehensive and the town hall obviously feels it has enough evidence to name Playhouse as the bar where the video was taken.' The council decision coincided with the introduction of new regulations governing bar crawls which have just come into force. Local officials have revealed that seven firms have applied for new 'bar crawl' licences - including Carnage . Paul Smith, who is a director of Carnage said he would be appealing the council's decision to fine the company . Seven firms thought to include Carnage have applied for new town hall licences to run the controversial events. Guides have to wear special jackets identifying them from punters and pub crawl groups are limited to 50 people. Opposition councillors in Magaluf say the decision to regulate them is sending out the wrong message and insist the answer if the resort is to clean itself up, is to ban them. Magaluf was branded a lawless party resort after the shocking sex video emerged. Council officials said under their rules young children cannot witness or participate in pornographic shows . Under new rules, guides escorting guests on their binge-drinking escapades have to wear special jackets . One of Majorca's top politicians Jose Ramon Bauza earlier branded Punta Ballena '500 metres of shame' New videos of British holidaymakers having sex in the street have been posted on the Internet since. Majorca’s top politician Jose Ramon Bauza branded Punta Ballena, the most brash part of Magaluf, as '500 metres of shame' earlier this week. Mayor Manuel Onieva has promised tough action to keep it 'ordered, organised and safe' but pledged not to turn his back on the area because so many local families depend on it for their livelihood. Calvia town hall said in a formal statement said: 'Calvia town hall has notified the owner of Playhouse in Martin Ros Garcia Street and those responsible for the firm Carnage Magaluf of a sanction of 12 months closure and a €55,000 fine. 'It notified them on Thursday afternoon after determining, following a full Calvia local police investigation, that it was in the Playhouse bar that multiple sex acts filmed on video and posted on the Internet earlier this month, took place. 'The incidents took place in mid-June according to the police report. 'The town hall also holds Carnage Magaluf responsible, because it was the organiser and promoter of the activity that took place during the pub crawl when the illegal act was committed.' Carnage director Paul Smith, who refused to apologise over the sex video, said last night he would release a statement early next week. Asked if he would appeal, he said: 'What do you think? Yes, of course.' The owner of Playhouse, which is run under a company name, could not be contacted.

"Ukraine warned last night that 80,000 Russian troops were massing on its borders and could invade – as world leaders told Vladimir Putin to back off. A senior security chief in Kiev said Moscow could launch a full-scale  invasion and Russian troops would be in the Ukrainian capital within ‘two or three hours’ of the order to advance. Photographs of Russian tanks and armoured personnel carriers close to Ukraine’s borders added to tensions. Last night senior British officials told the Mail they had received reports about Russian troops massing on the border since Tuesday and were concerned by the show of force. Scroll down for video .

British intelligence is unsure whether the movements are intended to back up the annexation of Crimea, preparation for an invasion or simply defensive. Moscow’s show of force came as Ukraine’s new prime minister, Arseniy Yatsenyuk, met Barack Obama in  the Oval Office and Nato continued military exercises in Poland. On a day of rising tensions, G7 leaders, including David Cameron and Mr Obama, warned Russia not to annexe the Crimea after a referendum on Sunday in the province, which has been taken over by pro-Putin troops. Their statement warns the Russian president ‘to cease all efforts to change the status of Crimea contrary to Ukrainian law and in violation of international law’ and threatens ‘further action’ if Moscow seizes Crimea. Foreign Secretary William Hague said Russian MPs who voted to use force in Ukraine and Kremlin officials behind the invasion would be hit with asset freezes and a travel ban to the European Union – most likely at a Brussels summit on Monday. But the main concern of Western leaders is to deter Russia from seizing the rest of Eastern Ukraine. On the move: Tanks pictured on the streets of Rostov in Russia . Military vehicles have been picture all over Russia's border regions. Here are APCs in Voronezh region . The moves come as the Russian armed forces have announced a separate huge military exercise by its airborne troops . Andriy Parubiy, secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defence Council, yesterday said that even Kiev may not be safe from Putin’s troops, who were regrouping in ‘an offensive manner’. Mr Parubiy claimed the forces massing included ‘over 80,000 personnel, up to 270 tanks, 180 armoured vehicles, 380 artillery systems, 18 multiple-launch missile systems, 140 combat aircraft, 90 combat helicopters and 19 warships and cutters’. He added: ‘Critical is the situation not only in Crimea, but along the entire north-eastern frontier. In fact, Russian troop units are two or three hours of travel from Kiev.’ Former Putin adviser Andrey Illarionov predicted this week that in addition to Crimea, his ex-boss intends to annex other major cities in Ukraine, including Kharkiv, Donetsk, Dnepropetrovsk, Lugansk, Zaporozhye, Kherson and Odessa. Pictures of Russian armoured vehicles on the move in regions close to the Ukrainian border – said to have been taken on Monday – include motorised infantry vehicles and tanks. The military movements are also said to include Grad BM-21 multiple rocket launch vehicles.

"Russia won the right to host the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi with the help of one of the world’s biggest heroin traffickers, it has been claimed. After the International Olympic Committee voted to award the games to Sochi in 2007, the head of the Russian bid publicly thanked Uzbek businessman Gafur Rakhimov for securing the votes of Asian countries ‘without which…it would have been hard for Sochi to count on the victory’. But according to US officials, Rakhimov is a mafia boss and heroin kingpin who is currently facing criminal charges in Uzbekistan. Accusations: Gafur Rakhimov was publicly thanked for his help in securing the Sochi Games for Russia. He has now been accused of being a 'very dangerous gangster' and one of the world's biggest heroin traffickers . '[Rakhimov] is one of the four or five most important people in the heroin trade in the world,' Craig Murray, a former British ambassador to Uzbekistan, told ABC News. 'He’s absolutely a very major and very dangerous gangster.' Russian president Vladimir Putin staked his international reputation on winning the winter games for Sochi despite concerns that the Black Sea resort sits in a region that is a hotbed of both corruption and terrorism. Rakhimov, a former boxer, admitted that he helped the Russian bid through his Central Asian contacts. 'He convinced them because of his good relations with these people. He has great influence,' said a spokesman for the alleged gangster. The spokesman denied claims that Rakhimov and his cronies have boasted that 'bags of cash' were used to secure the Olympic votes. 'It was not necessary,' he told ABC. Rakhimov is a leading member of an organised crime syndicate that specialises in exporting heroin from central Asia to Europe, including the UK. He was banned from attending the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney but he still serves as a vice president of the Olympic Council of Asia, a group of countries that are members of the IOC. After the vote to award the games to Sochi, the head of the Russian bid publicly thanked Uzbek businessman Gafur Rakhimov for securing the votes of Asian countries . Critics say Putin is ignoring or covering up clear evidence of corruption relating to the Games. The Russian president has staked his international reputation on Sochi . In 2012, the US Treasury put financial sanctions on him and tried to freeze his bank accounts across the world. It described Rakhimov as key member of a Russian-Asian crime network called the Brothers’ Circle. The Treasury said in a statement that he operated ‘major international drug syndicates involving the trafficking of heroin'. According to a Russian investigative journalist, Rakhimov has strong ties to some Russian officials. Putin has strenuously denied there was any corruption involved in Sochi beating more obvious candidates in Austria and South Korea to win the Winter Games. The International Olympic Committee has not commented on Rakhimov but said in a statement: 'The IOC has a strong, transparent, tried-and-tested bidding process.' The allegations are merely the latest in a string of international concerns that have been raised about the Sochi games, which have been described as the most expensive and most corrupt ever. Valery Morozov said tens of billions of dollars supposedly spent on Sochi Olympic projects, including the stadium (pictured), ended up in the pockets of well-connected Russian officials . A senior US intelligence official this week told the Senate Intelligence Committee there has been an increase in reports of security threats against the games. And a Russian businessman now sheltering in the UK said he is a 'marked man' after publicly claiming government officials demanded payoffs in return for Olympics construction contracts in Sochi. Valery Morozov said he was told he would be 'drowned in blood' in revenge for speaking out.According to Boris Nemtsov, a former Russian deputy prime minister and Putin opponent, tens of billions of dollars supposedly spent on Sochi Olympic projects has ended up in the pockets of well-connected Russian officials. He included the Olympic stadium, which he said cost three times as much as any stadium in the world, and a £5.5 billion project to build a 30-mile highway between Sochi and the skiing hills above the city. Critics say Putin is ignoring or covering up clear evidence of corruption.","Gafur Rakhimov was publicly thanked for help by Sochi Olympic bid chief .

"This is the brutal lynching and public display of the close confidante who shot dead Ahmed Wali Karzai - the half-brother of president Hamid Karzai. A group of men in plain clothes hung the corpse against the wall in Kandahar for around 20 minutes before they carried it away. Ahmed Wali Karzai was assassinated on . Tuesday by the man who is said to have been from his own tribe and . home town, whom he had travelled with and worked alongside for seven . years. Brutal: Sardar Mohammad, who shot dead Ahmad Wali Karzai, half-brother of Afghan President Hamid Karzai, hangs from a building in Kandahar . Grief-stricken: Afghan President Hamid Karzai bows his head during the memorial service for his half brother Ahmad Wali Karzai . Assassinated: Thousands of mourners attended the service along with Mr Karzai in the family's ancestral village of Karz . President Karzai was joined by thousands of mourners at the funeral of his half brother. The president, tribal leaders, . government officials and others attended first a morning prayer service . in the provincial capital, Kandahar, before travelling to the family's . ancestral home village of Karz for the funeral. A sea of mourners surged toward the grave as a large wooden coffin, adorned with red flowers was brought forward. Helicopters circled overhead as the coffin was lowered into the earth. Mr Karzai - surrounded by a ring of security men - was on the fringe of the throng of mourners, tears streaming down his cheeks. The president approached the grave, climbed into it and had to be pulled out by his shoulders as his grief got the better of him. Shock: Afghans cover the grave of Ahmad Wali Karzai with earth after he was shot dead by one of his own bodyguards . Security concerns: Ahmed Wali Karzai was head of the provincial council in Kandahar - an area still heavily influenced by the Taliban . Loss: Shah Wali Karzai, left, the younger brother of Ahmad Wali Karzai, arrives for the funeral . Shortly after the funeral in Karz, Mr Karzai held a press conference in the provincial capital. He said: 'My message for them (the Taliban) is that my countrymen, my brothers, should stop killing their own people. 'It is easy to kill and everyone can do it, but the real man is the one who can save people's lives.' Meanwhile, a suicide attack was reported at a mosque in Kandahar during a memorial service for Wali Karzai. The explosion killed the head of the provincial religious council and at least three others, the Interior Ministry and the Kandahar provincial government's media office said. 'Bomb blast killed chief of Kandahar Ulema Council and wounded 11 more in the mosque where people were praying for AWK,' the media office said on Twitter, referring to Ahmad Wali Karzai. Afghan television channel, Tolo TV, reported a second explosion near the mosque, but gave no further details. The Taliban has claimed responsibility for Wali Karzai's killing, but Afghan officials have said it is unclear whether he was shot by insurgents or died as a result of an internal dispute. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said in a statement that insurgent fighters killed Wali Karzai because he cooperated with British, U.S. and Canadian forces in the south. He said: 'He was aligned with foreign occupiers,' before describing him as a 'puppet' of the West and claiming he was on the CIA payroll. Killed: Ahmad Wali Karzai, right, was extremely influential in the south of Afghanistan . Tributes: Bismillah Muhammadi, Afghan Interior Minister, and General Sher Muhammad Karimi - the country's army chief - were also at the funeral . Alert: Police check vehicles near the house of Ahmad Wali Karzai in Kandahar. The assassin shot him in the head and chest, before being gunned down by other bodyguards . Attack: The body of the assassin is covered up. The Taliban has claimed responsibility for the killing, saying Ahmad Wali Karzai was cooperating with the West . Vacuum: Mr Karzai gave a press conference after the funeral, in which he attacked the Taliban for killing their own people . Walid Karzai had denied working for the CIA or having profited from the illegal seizure of government and private land - another Taliban claim. His death has left a dangerous power vacuum in the south as the Afghan government pursues peace talks with insurgents ahead of a U.S. troop withdrawal. The international military coalition has few friends of stature in the province and none with the influence of Mr Karzai's half brother - considered a master operator and the uncrowned 'king' of Kandahar. Without his sibling, the president will struggle to find an ally resourceful and ruthless enough to balance alliances with tribal and political leaders, drug runners and militias in a province where the Taliban still holds much influence. Rustam Shah, former Pakistan ambassador to Afghanistan, said Wali Karzai's death exposed the fragility of the security infrastructure in the southern provinces, particularly Kandahar. He said: 'It will be a big blow to the government's image in the Taliban stronghold in southern Afghanistan. 'The president will have to be very careful to move quickly to consolidate and maintain his power structure in Kandahar.'","Suicide attack at Wali Karzai's memorial service kills four, officials say ."
"Kim Kyong-hui, 67, is said to have died less than a month after her husband was executed by her nephew, Kim Jong-un . The aunt of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un has died in mysterious circumstances, it was reported today. Kim Kyong-hui, 67, whose husband Jang Song-Thaek was executed under Jong-un's orders less than a month ago, is said to have either suffered a heart attack or committed suicide by North Korean media. There has been speculation on her health and whereabouts since the death on 8 December of her husband, also 67, described as 'scum' by his 30-year-old nephew. Mrs Kim, who was said to have been receiving treatment for heart disease, reportedly had a heart attack soon after her husband was killed in what is believed to be an attempt by Kim Jong-un to tighten his grip on North Korea. South Korean newspaper the Chosunilbo reported that North Korean intelligence services believed Mrs Kim to be dead, but had not confirmed how or where she had died. One theory is that she died abroad while seeking medical treatment - she is known to have visited heart specialists in Singapore and Moscow. Once a key figure in the totalitarian regime, Mrs Kim, the sister of Kim Jong-un's father, former leader Kim Jong-il, has not been seen in public since 10 September, when she was spotted at a concert with her nephew and his wife. Despite her husband having been executed, Mrs Kim's life was believed to be safe, particularly when she was chosen to join other dignitaries planning the funeral of a senior Workers Party official who died last month. She is said to have suffered from alcoholism and depression since the death of her only child, daughter Jang Kum-song, who killed herself in Paris in 2006.

Toshimitsu Shigemura, a professor at Tokyo's Waseda University and an authority on North Korean affairs, told the Daily Telegraph that he would not be surprised if Mrs Kim were dead, given her history of ill health. He said: 'No one could go against her and she could force the party and the military to obey her orders by invoking her father's name. 'Her disappearance will inevitably cause a lot of political problems in Pyongyang.  Kim Jong-un may be trying to cover her disappearance up for a while to consolidate his own political strength.'","Kim Kyong-hui, 67, is aunt of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un, 30 .

"Help: The Tempe spray could be in bathroom cabinets as early as next year . He has already helped prevent millions of men from flopping in the bedroom. Now one of the inventors of Viagra claims to have a drug that will help many more experience the joy of sex. Mike Wyllie, one of the team of scientists who developed Viagra in the Nineties, is poised to launch a treatment for premature ejaculation. Tempe, a spray-on medication, has been . judged safe and effective by the European Medicines Agency and is . expected in bedroom cabinets early next year. Premature ejaculation is a problem that affects at least one in four men, making it more common than the impotence caused by Viagra. In trials, men who used the spray ahead of sex lasted on average five times longer. Women also benefited from longer love making, with both sexes expressing greater satisfaction with their sex life. Dr Wyllie, formerly of pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and now of small British biotech firm Plethora Solutions, said: ‘Premature ejaculation doesn’t just make the patient feel bad. ‘It does affect the partner and can completely destroy relationships. I feel this could save relationships.’ Premature ejaculation can wreck self-esteem, make it difficult to form and maintain relationships and, at its worst, can make it impossible for partner to become pregnant. Despite its toll, there is just one pill specifically designed to tackle the problem but it is expensive and not widely available in the UK. The exact causes are unclear but it is thought over-sensitivity is part of the problem. The Tempe spray contains low doses of two anaesthetics which help give a man more control. It only takes around five minutes to get work, although those who like to be spontaneous will be pleased to know it can be sprayed on up to two hours before sex. A pocket-sized can will last a year, if a man has sex five or six times a month. However, some of those who tested the drug experienced side-effects, including burning sensations and headaches. And some fear that using a drug as a ‘quick fix’ will prevent couples from confronting the stress, anxiety and relationship troubles that could be at the heart of the problem. Research: Dr Wyllie helped develop Viagra, pictured, which made £1.3billion worldwide last year . Tempe will only be available on private prescription initially. But it is hoped that it will be judged cheap enough in the long-run to be prescribed to some men on the NHS. With sales of Viagra worth £1.3billion a year worldwide, the new drug has the potential to be a blockbuster. However, Dr Wyllie will not receive any royalties from the sales and only has a very small holding in Plethora Solutions. He says he was motivated by scientific curiosity and that the launch will be a triumph for a small British company that lacks the manpower and resources of the big players in the market. Tempe’s preliminary approval for sale EU is expected to be rubber-stamped by the European Commission in the next few weeks. John Dean, one of Britain’s leading experts on male sexual problems and a past president of the International Society for Sexual Medicine, said: ‘Whilst premature ejaculation is not a life-threatening condition, its consequences can be serious. ‘This is a chronic, debilitating problem, affecting both men and their partners.’","Dr Mike Wyllie developed spray-on medication Tempe .

"Court case: A female soldier, known only as AB, is suing the Ministry of Defence for their handling of her sexual assault claims (file photo) A sailor is taking the Ministry of Defence to court after she was sexually assaulted by a British soldier in Afghanistan while they both stood guard over a terrorist. The woman, who is in her 20s, had her breasts fondled and was subjected to lewd demands for sex during the 12-hour ordeal, which left her ‘disgusted and terrified’. The incident happened after she was posted to Camp Bastion to watch over Zia Rahman, a rogue Afghan policeman who turned his gun on three British soldiers, killing them in July 2012. Last night, the woman, an Able Seaman who can be identified only as AB, revealed how Corporal Christopher Yard made unwanted sexual advances towards her as they stood guard in the compound’s hospital, where the injured Taliban terrorist had been taken. She said: ‘He groped my breast and I slapped his hand away. He said he could not help himself. He said he had cheated on his previous girlfriend and had a high sex drive, needing to have sex three to four times a day. ‘He also suggested we went on a midnight run together and have sex in a military container. I felt trapped because I could not leave my post.’ She added: ‘In a war zone and while we were guarding a significant terrorist, he fondled my breasts. 'To be sexually harassed and felt up by a more senior member of British Forces, while guarding a notorious suspect, was shocking and traumatic.’ She is bringing a compensation claim for sexual harassment and sex discrimination at an employment tribunal in Exeter. The MoD is defending the case, saying she did not properly comply with the military complaints procedure before issuing her claim. Under military rules, service personnel can bring a compensation claim only after they have exhausted the internal grievance process. Attack: The Camp Bastion checkpoint where three soldiers died in 2012 . Ms AB’s original complaint led to Yard being tried by a court martial for sexual assault. Although he pleaded not guilty, he was convicted and sentenced in June last year to 120 days’ detention and demoted two ranks to Trooper. At an appeal hearing last August his sentence was reduced to  30 days’ detention and demotion by one rank to Lance Corporal. Victim: AB was standing guard over a terrorist who killed three soldiers, including Warrant Officer Leonard Perran Thomas, pictured . But Ms AB, who returned to Britain at the end of her posting in August 2012, claims she was not properly  supported after the assault, which left her feeling ‘very vulnerable’. In a statement submitted to an employment tribunal, she said: ‘The next day, I reported the sexual assault to my superior. But Cpl Yard was not moved from his station so I was very afraid to have to work in relatively close proximity to him.’ She added: ‘They prosecuted him, but forgot about me. I never felt listened to. They still see staff who complain about the conduct of an officer as being the problem unless you accept their outcome. 'They do not have a victim-centred approach.’ Her lawyers say the legal action is a test case that will reveal how the  military has closed ranks on sexual harassment by denying complainants the right to take their cases to civil courts. Her solicitor, Lawrence Davies, of Equal Justice, said he believes there are ‘dozens’ of other cases that have been suppressed through MoD internal grievance rules. An MoD report in 2012 found all  of the 400 female soldiers questioned claimed to have experienced ‘unwanted sexual attention’. An MoD spokesman said: ‘While we cannot comment on individual or ongoing cases, the Armed Forces have a zero tolerance approach to all forms of bullying, discrimination and abuse.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Woman, in her 20s, had her breast fondled and sex demanded of her .

"One mother from Los Gatos, California was brutally punched outside of a dance studio in what may have been the sinister 'knockout game' occurring around the United States.

CBS reports that he was wearing jeans, a white t-shirt, and a backwards white baseball cap. 'We heard a commotion like a thunk and a scream,' dance instructor Mariana Sorbal told KPIX 5. The attack was unsolicited and characteristic of other 'knockout game' attacks around the US in which the attacker tries to knockout complete strangers with one punch. 'It was in the middle of the day. It wasn’t even dark yet, it was full of people. So obviously they’re trying to look for attention,' Sorbal said. 'It’s kind of scary, that someone thinks it’s a game to go ahead and punch people.' 'She's really shocked; it was a really traumatic experience and I think that's the most emotional part that's the hardest,'ballet teacher Mariana Sobal said to ABC news.' 'Physically she's fine. That's basically it.' ABC reports that residents are taking measures to protect themselves from a suspect who could attack at any time without warning.

Precautions: The move comes two days after it withdrew Swedish meatballs from stores across Europe and a handful of countries in Asia and the Caribbean after horse meat was discovered by Czech authorities .

Pub giant Whitebread - which owns Beefeater, Brewers Fayre, Table Table, Taybarns and Premier Inn - confirms it has found horsemeat in its products. Tesco reveals its Everyday value spaghetti bolognese contained up to 100 per cent horsemeat. Revealed that packs of Findus frozen lasagne meals being sold around the UK contained up to 100 per cent horse meat. The lasagne packs were manufactured by French company, Comigel, at a plant in Metz, which produces food for supermarkets in Britain and Europe. Comigel makes a range of beef products for Tesco and Aldi. Both stores begin removing those products as a ‘precautionary measure’. Asda removes four own-label brands of frozen burgers from sale following the discovery of beef contaminated with horse meat at a manufacturer in Northern Ireland. Burger King admits to selling burgers contaminated with horsemeat. Emerges that Asda and Co-op have also been selling burgers contaminated with horsemeat. Hotel chain Premier Inn removes beef burgers supplied by the company from its restaurants. It has also revealed schools and hospitals have been serving beef contaminated with horsemeat. However, the firm, which supplies . schools, military bases, hospitals and prisons, has kept vital . information about the recall secret. It is believed other catering firms . and restaurant chains are withdrawing a large number of products without . telling customers. The attitude of caterers is in contrast to most . supermarkets, which have volunteered information on contamination levels . and the names of manufacturers. Ikea’s meatballs are supposed to . contain only beef and pork, but Czech Republic watchdogs found evidence . of equine DNA. The products are made by the Swedish company, Familjen . Dafgard, using meat from Ireland, Sweden and Germany. Ikea said it did not make an announcement on Friday because it wanted to carry out its own tests, which are continuing. The company said: ‘We do not tolerate . any other ingredients than the ones stipulated in our recipes or . specifications. Ikea has immediately issued a sales stop of the batch . where indications of horse meat were identified in the Czech Republic . and other concerned countries – Slovakia, Hungary, France, UK, Portugal, . Italy, Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Greece, Cyprus and Ireland.’ Ikea’s Swedish meatballs are hugely popular in the UK, with the company selling 60,000 portions every week. The Government’s watchdog, the Food . Standards Agency (FSA), has allowed caterers and restaurants to keep . customers in the dark, but Labour’s shadow environment secretary, Mary . Creagh, said: ‘It is totally wrong for companies to recall suspect meat . products on the quiet without telling the FSA.’ Authorities . across Europe have started doing random DNA checks after traces of . horse meat turned up in frozen supermarket meals such as burgers and . lasagna beginning last month. The European Union's agriculture . ministers gathered in Brussels today to discuss the widening scandal's . fallout, with some member states pressing for tougher rules to regain . consumer confidence.

The scandal has created a split . between nations like Britain who see further rules as a protectionist . hindrance of free trade under the bloc's single market, and those . calling for tougher regulation. Processed . food products - a business segment with traditionally low margins that . often leads producers to hunt for the cheapest suppliers - often contain . ingredients from multiple suppliers in different countries, who . themselves at time subcontract production to others, making it hard to . monitor every link in the production chain. Standardised . DNA checks with meat suppliers and more stringent labeling rules will . add costs that producers will most likely hand down to consumers, making . food more expensive. The . scandal began in Ireland in mid-January when the country's announced the . results of its first-ever DNA tests on beef products. Consumer concern: The traces were found in one-kilogram packs of frozen meat balls made in Sweden . It tested frozen beef burgers taken from store shelves and found that more than a third of brands at five supermarkets contained at least a trace of horse. The sample of one brand sold by Tesco was more than a quarter horse. Such discoveries have spread like wildfire across Europe as governments, supermarkets, meat traders and processors began their own DNA testing of products labeled beef and have been forced to withdraw tens of millions of products from store shelves. The investigations have been complicated by elaborate supply chains involving multiple cross-border middlemen.","Ikea: Affected meatballs were also on sale in Netherlands, Belgium, Portugal .

"Leading optometrist Andrew Hogan said a fringe across the face can obstruct light and stimulation to eye making it amblyotic . But expert Dr Leonard Press said this can only happen if the eye is permanently covered BEFORE the age of seven . It's a hairstyle favoured by celebs from Rihanna to Justin Bieber and often copied by their young fans. But a leading optometrist has warned that having a side fringe that falls into the face can cause long-term eye damage. Andrew Hogan told the Australian Daily Telegraph: 'If a young emo chap has a fringe covering one eye all the time, that eye won't see a lot of detail. And if it happens from a young age, that eye can become amblyotic.' Hair raising: Rihanna, left, and Cameron Diaz often wear a side fringe - but could it damage their sight? Not according to experts . Amblyopia is more commonly known as a lazy eye and is a childhood condition which means the sufferer can't see as clearly out of one eye, so they rely on the other. It can occur as a child's sight develops so if a child has one of their eyes blocked, eg by an eye patch, when they are in a key developmental stage then they could develop a lazy eye. Mr Hogan believes having a side fringe means the hair can become like an eye patch across the eye and so cause the condition, and also short-sightedness, by restricting sunlight and stimulation from reaching the eye. 'If you walk around with an eye patch on all day, then that eye will end up seeing more poorly than the other eye,' he explained. Emo trend: Members of the band 30 Seconds To Mars favour the fringe across the face look . He added that he was aware that visual development took place between birth to seven years, but that research had shown him vision could still be affected at later stages. But experts have poured cold water on Mr Hogan's theory. Amblyopia specialist Dr Leonard Press told MSNBC: 'The story would only be true if you had somebody young enough, and if that person never looked out of that eye - if it was blocked 24-7. The reason it's false is that you don’t have that constant deprivation.' Dr Press added that vision is 'so well-established' after the age of seven that 'combing your hair over your eye will not do anything to that system'. So teenagers and young people can rest assured that they won't be risking their long-term eye sight by wearing the trendy style. However, a leading Australian hairdresser told the Australian Telegraph they do run another risk - a sore neck! Roseanne Anderson said: 'I have to wonder how they don't get a stiff neck. I . have seen lots of fashions come and go - but really when I think about . it, this is probably the only hairstyle in my 40 years of hairdressing . that could be a health hazard.'","Leading optometrist Andrew Hogan said a fringe across the face can obstruct light and stimulation to eye making it amblyotic .

"New video has emerged from the Kenyan mall massacre showing four gunmen prowling through a lower-level storeroom as they search for potential targets. The footage, captured by the mall's CCTV system shows terrorists armed with automatic weapons  mid-way through the assault while many of the victims remained trapped . inside the building. A military spokesman today confirmed . the names of the four fighters implicated in the attack that turned into . a four-day-long siege. Scroll down for video . On the prowl: New CCTV footage from inside the Kenyan Westfield Shopping centre shows four of the gunmen searching through lower-level storerooms . At least 67 people were killed in the . attack on Nairobi's Westgate Mall, which the al-Qaida-linked Somali . militant group al-Shabab has claimed responsibility for. Major Emmanuel Chirchir said the attackers were Abu Baara al-Sudani, Omar Nabhan, Khattab al-Kene and Umayr, names that were first broadcast by a local Kenyan television station. 'I confirm those are the names of the terrorist,' he said, in a Twitter message sent to The Associated Press. The identities of the men come as a private television station in Nairobi obtained and broadcast the CCTV footage from the Nairobi mall. The footage shows no more than four attackers. They are seen calmly walking through a storeroom inside the complex, holding machine guns. The first two gunmen to enter the room head toward two adjacent rooms. The massacre, which took place two weeks ago left at least 67 people dead . Another gunman, armed with a large automatic weapon, stands in the middle of the room while another investigates a side room . The footage is believed to have been taken mid-way through the assault while many of the victims remained trapped inside the building . One of the men's pant legs appears to . be stained with blood, though he is not limping, and it is unclear if . the blood is his, or that of his victims'. The . footage contradicts earlier government statements which indicated that . between 10 to 15 attackers were involved in the Sept. 21 attack. Terrified . shoppers hid behind mannequins, inside cardboard boxes, in storage . rooms, in ventilation shafts and in the parking lot underneath parked . cars, many hiding for hours before help arrived. Al-Shabab, . al-Qaida's affiliate in neighboring Somalia, claimed responsibility for . the attack, saying it was revenge for Kenya's military intervention in . Somalia in 2011 that was aimed at flushing out the extremists. Little is known about the identities of the attackers, beyond their names. Earlier this week a Kenyan government official said there may not have been as many attackers as first suspected . Previous footage to emerge from the massacre showed terrorists casually strolling through the building shooting unarmed civilians . Response team: A grab from a video made available on Saturday September 28 showing an armed undercover police officer guarding a stairwell approaching the scene of the terror attack . Rescued: Undercover police officers and police with guns asking shoppers caught up in the incident to leave with their hands up as they crouch on the ground for cover . Matt . Bryden, the former head of the United Nations Monitoring Group on . Somalia and Eritrea, said via email that al-Kene and Umayr are known . members of al-Hijra, the Kenyan arm of al-Shabab. He . added that Nabhan may be a relative of Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan, one of . the most-wanted al-Qaida operatives in the region and an alleged plotter . in the 1998 bombings at U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that . killed more than 250 people. He was killed in 2009 when Navy SEALS led a strike in the town of Barawe in Somalia where he was hiding. Early . Saturday, foreign military forces carried out a pre-dawn strike against . fighters in the same southern Somali village. The strike in Barawe took . place in the hours before morning prayers against what one official . said were 'high-profile' targets, without providing further details. A . Western intelligence official said it appeared likely that either U.S. or French forces carried out the attack. Both insisted on anonymity to . discuss intelligence matters. A . resident of Barawe - a seaside town 240 kilometers (150 miles) south of . Mogadishu - said by telephone that heavy gunfire woke up the . population. Escape: A young girl runs from a store in Westgate, beckoned on by officials and shoppers . Terrified: Civilians take cover as gunmen roam the mall during the terrorist attack earlier this month . Saved: A woman drops from a ventilator shaft in the mall as plain clothed police rescue her . A soldier carries a child to safety as armed police hunt the gunmen who went on a brutal shooting spree at Westgate shopping centre in Nairobi on September 21 . A Somalia intelligence official said the targets were 'high-profile' foreigners in the house. Foreign militaries - often the U.S. but not always - have carried out several strikes inside Somalia in recent years against al-Shabab or al-Qaida leaders. The two groups have formal ties. In September 2009 a daylight commando raid carried out by Navy SEALs in Barawe killed six people, including Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan, one of the most-wanted al-Qaida operatives in the region and an alleged plotter in the 1998 bombings at U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed more than 250 people. Military raids carried out by troops on the ground carry the risk of a troops being killed or captured, but they also allow the forces to collect bodies or other material as evidence. Missile strikes from sea of unmanned drones carry less risk to troops but increase the chances of accidental civilian deaths. A man accused of developing chemical . weapons for the extremist al-Shabab group that was behind the Kenyan . shopping centre atrocity is a former British citizen, it has been . reported. Madhi Hashi, . formerly of Camden, north London, is suspected of being a leading figure . in the al Qaida-linked group which has claimed the assault at the . Westgate mall in Nairobi that killed at least 67 people. The . 24-year-old is accused of being a member of 'an elite al-Shabab suicide . bombing unit' and having 'specific knowledge regarding significant al . Qaida members operating in East Africa who sought to carry out attacks . against US and Western interests', The Times reported. The . newspaper said that while not charged with offences relating to . chemical weapons, it is alleged that Hashi and his two co-accused had . 'substantial knowledge' on an al-Shabab department that was developing . chemical weapons and that this will form part of the case against them. Hashi . and the two other men are awaiting trial in New York. It is alleged . that between 2008 and 2012, they travelled to Somalia to receive weapons . and explosives training from al-Shabab and were 'deployed in combat . operations' there. The trio were captured while preparing to travel to Yemen to allegedly meet up with al-Shabab members. A . Foreign Office spokesman said: 'The FCO became aware of Hashi's . detention by US authorities on terrorism-related charges in 2012.' It . is understood that Somalian-born Hashi came to Britain in 1995 and . became a citizen in 2004, but that last year his family was told Home . Secretary Theresa May had revoked his citizenship.","Four gunmen pictured searching through lower-level storerooms .

"Ransom payments made to kidnappers are fuelling terrorism around the world, the Foreign Office has warned. The number of groups demanding money to release hostage is on the rise, with ransoms increasing by 25 per cent in just three years. There are fears that more and more countries are now willing to stump up money to free citizens being held by terrorists, increasing the likelihood of more kidnappings. Warning: The Foreign Office says the number of ransoms paid to kidnappers is on the rise, with more money demanded to release captives . The G8 summit in Lough Erne, Northern Ireland in June agreed to ‘stamp out’ ransom payments to terror groups. David Cameron called on private firms to follow the lead of the most powerful countries in the world. Downing Street said it wanted to ‘suffocate terrorist sources of financing’. However, the families of people who are kidnapped say they had little choice but to pay money to have their loved ones returned. Somali gunmen kidnapped Brits Paul and Rachel Chandler off the Seychelles four years ago. Mrs Chandler's brother Stephen Collett negotiated a significant ransom for their release as the only option to secure the couple's release. Mr Collett said: 'I'm very unhappy at paying ransoms. But if we have a policy where there is no alternative, and the Foreign Office don't give you an alternative, they just seem to think if you just sit back and do nothing, eventually they might be released.' In the last three years £45million is thought to have been paid to free western hostages, equivalent to . But Foreign Office officials say the amount charged per hostage is on the rise, from $4million in 2010 to $5million this year, the BBC reported. British sailors Paul and Rachel Chandler were only released by Somali pirates after their family paid a substantial ransom . Earlier this year $22million was paid to Al Qaeda to release Swiss, Austrian and Finnish hostages and weeks later there was a security alert which closed US and UK embassies in Yemen. Aimen Deen, a terrorism expert from security consultants Five Dimensions, said: ‘Basically the money is taken and divided into several categories for several departments. ‘There is the weapons department. There are the training camps that need food and electricity. ‘They need money for weapons for training, they need to obtain chemicals for explosives, they need to pay for the tickets for people to travel... the renting of apartments abroad and the building of camps outside and inside of Yemen.’ The UK has had a policy of not paying ransoms since the 1970s, insisting it only encourages more hostage-taking. The Foreign Office said: ‘We want others in the international community to follow the G8’s lead so that terrorist groups no longer have any access to finances traditionally secured through ransom payments. ‘We believe this will severely hinder their ability to operate since ransoms represent the single most significant source of terrorist income.’","Ransoms have risen from $4million in 2010 to $5million per hostage .

"A Muslim father has revealed he warned the Prime Minister’s office of worrying Islamist practices at one of the scandal-hit ‘Trojan Horse’ schools – but got no reply. The Mail on Sunday has learned that David Cameron’s office received an email in February from Mohammed Zabar, whose ten-year-old daughter attends Oldknow Academy. Oldknow is one of the schools investigated in connection with an alleged fundamentalist plot to take over Birmingham schools. Mohammed Zabar's daughter attends Oldknow Academy in Birmingham, one of the schools investigated in the Trojan Horse plot . Mr Zabar warned the Government that he believed the school over-emphasised Islamic teaching at the expense of other faiths. He said the school closed for a Muslim festival but had no Christmas celebrations. Downing Street did not respond to Mr Zabar’s email. Instead he was advised by the Education Funding Agency to ‘contact Oldknow Academy directly and make a complaint’. Mr Zabar had already met the school principal, whom he says did not deal with his concerns. News of the Trojan Horse plot broke in March and Mr Cameron spoke about it for the first time in April after claims that non-Muslim members of staff were being  isolated, male and female pupils were segregated and assemblies were used to promote the teachings of Al Qaeda. The Prime Minister promised to take ‘swift action’ to ensure schools could not be used to spread the  ideology of terrorists, and an  investigation into schools in Birmingham started. One report later uncovered allegations that pupils as young as six at Oldknow were taught to treat Western women as ‘white prostitutes’. How The Mail on Sunday reported the story . And there were claims that extermists pushed out the head teacher because she opposed the ‘Islamisation’ of the school. Mr Zabar believes the Government should have acted on his guidance much earlier. He said: ‘I was angry and frustrated that my concerns had been so easily dismissed. ‘When the Trojan Horse scandal broke I wrote to them again saying perhaps they might want to reassess my information in light of recent evidence. I never had a reply to that one.It was distressing and disappointing to have my concerns ignored.’ Peter Clarke, former national head of counter-terrorism at the Metropolitan Police, was appointed in April to investigate the Trojan Horse plot to hijack the schools by Islamic extremists. His report is due to be handed in to the Government imminently. Last night shadow education secretary  Tristram Hunt accused Mr Cameron of ‘shocking complacency’. He said: ‘The Government was warned about the problems in Birmingham’s schools as long ago as 2010. Now it is revealed that warnings by parents were being fobbed off  by No 10.’ A Department for  Education spokesman  said: ‘We were already investigating Oldknow by the time this letter [Mr Zabar’s] was sent. The email alert about Oldknow is revealed in a Channel 4 Dispatches documentary, to be screened tomorrow night. The TV investigation also features The Olive School, a Muslim faith primary for 600 pupils in Blackburn. It is understood to have found: . The Olive School is run by the Tauheedul Islam Faith, Education and Community Trust. The Trust confirmed that  Dispatches had filmed undercover in The Olive School and promised  to act ‘if anything that emerges  on the film is shown to undermine our progressive vision, ethos  and approach’. A Tauheedul governor said: ‘The trust’s schools provide a first class education for young people in modern-day Britain.’ The governor added: ‘We need to look at what these schools have achieved for their pupils.’ Blackburn MP Jack Straw said:  ‘I reserve final judgment until I see the programme. ‘From what I know the allegations are groundless.’ Dispatches also reveals how more than 1,000 Jewish boys aged 13-16 have been removed from state schools in Hackney, east London, to study at Yeshivas – study centres held in small rooms where the  lessons focus almost solely on  religious teachings.","Alleged fundamentalist plot to take over Birmingham schools sparked national concern .

"US special forces failed in an attempt to free the British hostage who ISIS militants have threatened to kill,  Philip Hammond confirmed this morning. The Foreign Secretary said the Government was now considering a number of ways to protect the hostage, adding: 'We will look at every possible option.' Mr Hammond also said Britain would also 'certainly consider' airstrikes against ISIS. Mr Hammond's remarks came after jihadist militants released a second sickening video yesterday which showed US journalist Steven Sotloff being beheaded by a fighter with an English accent. At the end of the video, a British hostage is filmed on his knees in a similar orange jumpsuit to those worn by the two men already killed by the extremist group, sparking fears he could be their next victim. Scroll down for video . US journalist Steven Sotloff (pictured) was the latest victim of ISIS jihadists and a video of his killing included footage of a British hostage, who it is feared could become the fanatics' next victim . David Cameron, addressing members of the NATO Parliamentary assembly last night, has branded the latest video 'absolutely disgusting and despicable' Mr Hammond confirmed this morning that the man - who UK media are not naming at the request of the family but who has been named and pictured around the world - was the subject of a failed rescue attempt by US commandos earlier this summer. Last month the Pentagon revealed it had launched the attempt to rescue a number of hostages held in Syria, including James Foley, the journalist killed in the first video. But the mission failed to bring back any hostages because the jihadist gang had moved prior to American commandos' arrival. Mr Hammond suggested this morning that Britain could launch a fresh rescue attempt to save the captured Briton. He said the Government had been aware of a British citizen being held by ISIS for some time and confirmed that the US had launched a failed attempt to save him and American hostages . After a meeting of the Government’s emergency Cobra committee, Mr Hammond said the hostage situation would not alter the Government’s overall strategy on dealing with ISIS militants. He said: ‘It can’t allow us to change our overall strategy. We’ve been aware of this hostage, of course, for some time, but we have to deal with IS on the basis of the wider threat that they pose to the British public, as well as to this individual.’ He said the situation would not affect the likelihood of British airstrikes against the militants. ‘It doesn’t make any difference at all to our strategic planning. As the Prime Minister said, we will look very carefully at the options available to us to support the legitimate government of Iraq and Kurdistan in defending themselves from the threat of Isil. ‘And if we judge that airstrikes could be beneficial, could be the best way to do that then we will certainly consider them, but we’ve made no decision to do so at the moment.’ He confirmed that British analysis of a video released yesterday appearing to show the British hostage, as well as the execution of US journalist Steven Sotloff, had concluded it was genuine. ‘The US president will be making an announcement shortly on the basis of US analysis, but our preliminary analysis is that this video is genuine, that it is Mr Sotloff, and that it appears to be the same person with an apparently British voice that appeared in the last video. ‘Obviously our thoughts are with the family and friends of Mr Sotloff and we’re doing everything we can to reassure the family of the British hostage who was shown in the video.’ It is believed the British hostage, who is not being named by UK media, and James Foley (pictured), who was the first man killed in the videos, were the subject of a failed  rescue mission earlier this summer . Journalists Mr Sotloff (left) and Mr Foley (right) had been covering the war in Syria when they were kidnapped . David Cameron has chaired a number of secret Cobra meetings in recent months focused on the British hostage and options to secure a safe release. Last night, the Prime Minister was briefed by his senior security officials on the developing situation, ahead of today's meeting of Cobra. Mr Cameron has hit out at the ‘absolutely disgusting, despicable’ murder of Mr Sotloff. He said: 'If verified, this is a despicable and barbaric murder. My thoughts and prayers are with Mr Sotloff’s family and friends tonight as they deal with this appalling and tragic situation. 'As I have said consistently over the last few weeks, ISIL terrorists speak for no religion. They threaten Syrians, Iraqis, Americans and British people alike and make no distinction between Muslims, Christians or any other faith.' He is not thought to have spoken to President Obama, who is travelling to Estonia ahead of the NATO summit in Wales later this week. The British hostage is believed to be an aid worker who was based on the Turkish border of Syria, working with victims of war. Government sources have stressed that Britain has a long-standing principle not to publicise kidnappers or terrorists. But UK authorities are in touch with the man's family and are continuing to provide support for them, it is understood.","British hostage paraded before camera in latest ISIS beheading video .

"Reverend Jesse Jackson has weighed in on the controversy surrounding Duck Dynasty, comparing Phil Robertson to the driver who had ordered Rosa Parks to sit in the back of the bus. The 67-year-old Robertson family patriarch and star of the mega-hit A&E reality show has unleashed a firestorm earlier this month after making anti-gay remarks in a interview with GQ. Mr Robertson had been quoted in a January 2014 edition of the magazine as saying: 'It seems . like, to me, a vagina - as a man - would be more desirable than a man’s . anus. Speaking out: Civil rights leader Reverend Jesse Jackson released a statement condemning Phil Robertson for his recent homophobic remarks .

For Reverend Jackson and his Rainbow PUSH Coalition, as well as for the LGBT organization GLAAD, these attempts at damage control have been insufficient. ‘These statements uttered by Robertson are more offensive than the bus driver in Montgomery, Alabama, more than 59 years ago,’ Jackson said in a statement obtained by ABC News. ‘At least the bus driver, who ordered Rosa Parks to surrender her seat to a white person, was following state law.

'His . personal views in no way reflect those of A&E Networks, who have . always been strong supporters and champions of the LGBT community. 'The network has placed Phil under hiatus from filming indefinitely,' said the statement released to Entertainment Weekly. The show will go on: Robertson's family will continue starring in the series. He is pictured here with wife Kay in May . However, a source at the network told EW Monday that Phil will be featured in new episodes when the fourth season debuts in mid-January, and that they would ideally like to keep him on for a fifth season. Uncertain future: Robertson has been suspended from the show by A&E, but he will likely return or the fifth season . According to the source, the network is hoping the situation will blow over during the holiday season. The reality show - which follows the Robertson clan running their duck-calling business in the swampland of West Monroe, Louisiana - has been a runaway success for A&E, with a Christmas special recently pulling in 9 million viewers. The 67-year-old came under fire from gay rights group GLAAD after making the homophobic comments in the January 2014 issue of GQ magazine. He told the magazine: 'Everything is blurred on what’s right and what’s wrong… Sin becomes fine. Start with homosexual behaviour and just morph out from there. 'Bestiality, sleeping around with this woman and that woman and that woman and those men.' Robertson, who claims to be devoutly . Christian, also grouped homosexuals in with terrorists and prostitutes . when he referenced a Bible quote in the magazine interview. He . said: 'Don’t be deceived.

"The ex-front man of a 'homo-punk' band has been removed as the official Girl Scouts spokesman after outraged mothers complained. Risque videos from Joshua Ackley's band The Dead Betties led to a flurry of complaints by parents who questioned whether he was the best person to represent the Girl Scout movement. Videos of the chief press spokesman's old band, which were referred to as 'homo punk' by various media outlets showed a woman being stalked and a man writhing in newspaper. Outrage: Joshua Ackley is no longer the official spokesman of the Girl Scouts after parents complained about his punk band past . Mr Ackley had been the chief representative of the Scouts for several years, and also worked as a blogger for the organization, Breitbart reported. He has been the main port of call for everything, from Girl Scouts wanting advice to parents concerned about changes in the movement. He was also sent in to soothe concerned mothers who claimed Planned Parenthood brochures were found at girls-only UN panel hosted by the group in 2011. Although the organization denied any knowledge of the brochure, the group has come under criticism in recent years for its distribution of funds from cookie sales and alleged support for abortion, the Washington Times reported. Parents singled out two Dead Bettie . videos still available on YouTube, although the band's account has been . inactive for several years. In one, scenes of a woman being stalked and then strangled are cut in with footage of Mr Ackley, who performed under the name Joshua Starr, and the band playing.

"A judge has described the UK’s borders as 'a leaking sieve' after an illegal immigrant drug dealer was deported three times only to return each time to commit more crimes. Albanian national Baksim Bushati, 37, . was sentenced to seven years in prison after he was found to have . almost 1kg of cocaine worth £26,875 and £14,000 in cash at his home. Since . 2005, he has been sentenced to prison terms totalling nearly five years . for offences of violence, battery and possessing false identification. Control: Judge Richard Bray (left) described the UK's borders as a 'leaking sieve' as sentenced jailed Albanian-national Baksim Bushati, 37, (right) to seven years in prison, having already been deported three times . Despite being deported from the UK following each jail term, he returned to commit more crimes. Yesterday, Judge Richard Bray criticised the Government as he sentenced Bushati to his latest prison stretch, saying the UK’s borders 'leaked like a sieve.' 'These things make a classic study for people who want to see if the Home Office and the Border Agency are doing their jobs properly,' the judge told Northampton Crown Court. 'It just shows how powerless they appear to be. They are hopelessly undermanned and that is what has caused this situation. 'It is our duty to point this out so the public are aware of it. 'Leaking sieve': Judge Richard Bray said the Home Office and Border Agency were 'hopelessly undermanned', meaning Bushati could return to the UK three times despite being deported . 2005: Bushati is jailed for three-and-a-half years for an offence of violence before being deported back to Albania . September 2010: Sent to prison for 54 weeks for possession of false identification documents. Is deported again but smuggles himself back into Britain. January 2013: Bushati is jailed for 16 weeks for battery. It is again recommended he be deported on completing the sentence. December 17, 2013: Tries to evade capture, only to be stopped by police dogs. Is found with £960 in cash, Albanian identification documents and two mobile phones. February 5, 2014: Is sentenced to seven years in prison after he admits possession of Class A drugs with intent to supply. 'As I have been saying for the last 10 years, it is a very serious problem which is simply not being dealt with. 'Our defences to illegal immigrants are leaking like a sieve. I can only hope you will be successfully deported on this occasion.' For his latest offence, Bushati, from Weedon, Northamptonshire, jumped out of a moving car to try and evade capture on December 17 last year before he was stopped by police dogs. Jonathan . Eley, prosecuting, said Bushati, who admitted possession of Class A . drugs with intent to supply, was found with £960 cash, Albanian . identification documents and two mobile phones. 'He gave a false address of Charles Street, Northampton, before officers traced him to his real home in Weedon,' he said. 'The defendant said his ""life was over"" and he was ""done for"" as a result of his arrest.' Bushati . was first jailed in the UK for three-and-a-half years in 2005 before . being deported back to Albania on his release from prison. But . he managed to sneak back into Britain and in September 2010 he was sent . to prison for 54 weeks for possession of false identification . documents. He was deported again but he just weeks after arriving in Albania he smuggled himself back into Britain. In January 2013 he was jailed for 16 weeks for battery. Maxine Crone, defending, said: 'He got himself into debt with people he was afraid of and it was they who provided him with the drugs, and effectively forced him to sell them. 'The trouble he’s had means he would prefer to be back in Albania.' Sentenced: Northampton Crown Court was told Bushati was first jailed in the UK for three-and-a-half years in 2005 before being deported back to Albania on his release from prison . A Home Office spokesman said they 'do not routinely comment' on individual cases. 'The Government turned Border Force into its own separate command with a clear law enforcement ethos and security has been re-established as the priority,' said a spokesman. 'For the first time there is a clear operating mandate, set by ministers, and all passengers are now subject to full checks at the UK border. 'We have invested heavily both in staff and technology to improve security and keep out those with no right to be here. 'It will take time to transform all areas of Border Force but we are confident that we are making the right changes.' Judge Bray is well known for his no-nonsense approach in court. In November 2010 when he was handed a poem by a car thief asking for leniency he sentenced him to jail with his own rhyme. Handing prolific crook Steven Snell to 20 months in prison, he rapped: 'Right now you feel down, You have got months to do, Despite what you done, Let us hope the locked door, will make you more sure not to come back for more.' And in March 2013, he branded translation company Capita TI 'hopelessly incompetent' after an interpreter did not turn up for a case which was forced to adjourn. Last year it was revealed that the now defunct UK Border Agency was dealing with a backlog of 320,000 cases, which was expected to take more than 20 years to clear. Former chief Tony Smith blamed the problem on an influx of illegal immigrants who arrived in the UK between 2000 and 2003, many of whom have since changed their names and become untraceable. The agency has now been split into two sections, one to deal with immigration visas and one to deal with immigration law enforcement, which operates as Border Force. There has also been growing tensions within the coalition over immigration and border control. Last year the Tories accused the Lib Dems by accusing them of holding back anti-immigration measures, and the Lib Dems accusing the Home Office of dragging its feet over plans to reinstate exit checks at borders to tackle illegal immigration. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg had objected to a pilot scheme to drive vans around bearing posters telling illegal immigrants to ‘Go home or face arrest’. His party also tried to scale back plans for immigration bonds – £3,000 payments on top of visas issued to visitors from high-risk countries, repayable only upon leaving Britain.","Baksim Bushati, 37, was jailed for seven years after admitting drug charges .

"Twin British schoolgirls who ran away to Syria were star pupils, with 28 GCSEs between them. Salma and Zahra Halane were among the top 20 students at their girls’ school in Manchester but slipped out of their bedrooms and have fled abroad to become 'jihadi brides'. The 16-year-olds, who disappeared two weeks ago, have telephoned their parents to tell them they have reached the war-torn country and warned them 'we're not coming back'. Their mother told the Daily Mail last night: ‘I’m just so shocked.’ The 44-year-old, who wears a hijab, then broke down in tears at her semi-detached home in a leafy suburb of Chorlton, Manchester. Police said today that the twins 'potentially pose a threat to themselves and the community'. Scroll down for video . Star pupils: Twin British schoolgirls who ran away to Syria had 28 GCSEs between them. More recently the girls attended Manchester's Connell Sixth Form College, based at the East Manchester Academy (pictured) The sisters may have followed their brother, who is thought to have flown out to fight with terror group ISIS last year. Salma achieved 13 GCSEs, 11 of which . were A*-C, while Zahra achieved 15 passes, 12 of which were A*-C grades - . placing the girls within the top 10 per cent of their year group of 200 . students. The girls’ parents raised the alarm two weeks ago, after entering the twins’ room one morning to find their beds empty and passports and clothes missing. The girls boarded a flight to Turkey from Manchester airport, and police alerted counter-terrorism colleagues in an attempt to trace the pair. However, the twins – who have nine siblings, one of whom is a medical student – later contacted their parents to inform them they had crossed the border and reached war-torn Syria. Officers are investigating how the . girls funded their trip, over fears they may have been bankrolled by . jihadi fighters who want them as their wives. The North West Counter Terrorism Unit head Detective Chief Superintendent Tony Mole, said: 'First, I want to stress that the welfare of these two teenagers is our overarching priority. 'Two 16-year-old girls left the UK on June 26 and we believe that they have since entered Syria. 'At this stage we don't know for sure why they are there, or exactly who they are with. 'They are clearly posing a threat to themselves and potentially the community and their family and friends are concerned for their well-being. 'It is also important that we thank the community for their assistance in this matter while reminding them and the wider media that the family remain very concerned for the safety of their daughters'. Extremists: Iraq and Syria are under threat from militants who fight under the banner of the Islamist group ISIS . The twins’ elder brother is already known to police in Greater Manchester, and is known to be abroad. Counter-terrorism officers plan to question him if he attempts to return to Britain. The Halane family, originally from Somalia, have told friends and community leaders they are ‘absolutely devastated.’ Mohammed Shafiq, of the Ramadan Foundation, said: ‘The family is shocked and absolutely devastated, especially their mother. ‘Their son went to fight for ISIS about a year ago and has been over there since then. They believe he was radicalised over the internet. 'There . has been an abject failure of intelligence agencies. How can two . 16-year-old girls travel unaccompanied from Manchester Airport and . arrive in Istanbul without any questions being asked?' - Mohammed Shafiq, Ramadan Foundation . ‘The family were desperately unhappy to discover he had gone to Syria and they thought they were keeping a watchful eye on their other children ... and then this happens. ‘Their parents and . brothers and sisters are desperately concerned for their safety and know . they are in danger. It is extremely distressing for them. ‘ . ‘There . has been an abject failure of intelligence agencies. How can two . 16-year-old girls travel unaccompanied from Manchester Airport and . arrive in Istanbul without any questions being asked?’ Shortly before their disappearance the girls were pictured attending an open day at their school, the newly-opened Connell Sixth Form College in Beswick, Manchester. The girls’ father is known to pray at the Al Furqan Mosque in Moss Side, Manchester, but neither girls are thought to have attended. Omar Barud, chairman of the mosque, said neither of the twins nor their mother had ever worshipped there. ‘We don’t support any form of extremism here and we have a very good relationship with the police,’ he said. ‘I . wouldn’t want my daughter to travel to somewhere like Syria - at their . age they should still be with their family, finishing their studies.' Brits: Reyaad Khan from Cardiff (left) was also a promising student and appeared in this ISIS recruitment clip . Sources believe the two girls may have been radicalised over the internet using online forums to communicate with other like-minded teenagers. They say the influence of an older brother, who they loved and respected and who had already left to fight jihad in Syria, ‘should not be under-estimated.’ The source said: ‘The whole thing may have been their brother’s idea and he may have facilitated the money for the tickets and they simply went along with it. ‘Obviously it is deeply troubling that teenage girls from backgrounds far removed from Syria are now being lured over there as jihadi brides.’ Mussurut Zia, general secretary of the Muslim Women’s Network UK, described what had happened to the girls as ‘religious grooming’ and said becoming a jihadi bride was not allowed in Islam. She said: ‘The concept has probably been sold to the girls by people they may be in touch with through the process of recruiting. It may be they feel this is their personal role is this situation in Syria. ‘I see this as religious grooming. Because the girls are so young I doubt they will be able to make these decisions for themselves. They are going to be in awe of these people who are out there. They are probably older, they have the language, the rhetoric.’ A Greater Manchester Police spokesman said: ‘Greater Manchester Police is continuing to provide support to the family of two young girls, who were recently reported missing from their Manchester home, and are now believed to be abroad.  At this stage, although the girls have made contact with their family we have no definitive evidence of exactly where the two girls are.’ The sisters have been described as 'quiet' and 'extremely religious'. One neighbour said the girls were 'kept indoors' by their parents, although their brothers were allowed to come and go more freely. A neighbour told The Sun: 'How do two young girls afford to fly out of the country without anyone stopping them? 'There are eight or nine kids in the house but I normally see the boys going in and out. The girls are kept indoors. They don't socialise with the rest of the estate'.","Salma and Zahra Halane were among top 20 students at their girls' school .

"A chimpanzee who spent years working as a mascot at one of the biggest casinos in Russia, has been treated for addiction to cigarettes and alcohol. John was left on the career scrapheap when the practice of employing chimps in such roles was outlawed across the country. But years of socialising with gamblers had seen John develop a couple of unhealthy vices. Rehab: Chimpanzee John, pictured here with Soviet actor Leonid Bronevoy, had to undergo treatment for an addiction to cigarettes and alcohol . Vices: John pictured drinking during his time as a mascot for one of Russia's biggest casinos . Past life: John enjoys a cigarette while socialising at the casino . Though casino bosses found John a new home at Gekendzhik Safari Park, in south west Russia, when he could no longer work, he was unable to kick his bad habits. John continued to smoke thanks to visitors throwing lit cigarettes into his enclosure and began stealing pints of beer from visitors. Peter Skorsky, deputy director at the safari park, said: ''We saw this and tried to prevent possible ""gifts"" but he still managed to drink and smoke.' Eventually, John was sent to the zoo's own form of rehab - a specially built glass enclosure - and his diet was given a radical overhaul. Famous: John was featured on advertising hoardings for the Space casino . Healthier and happier: John, pictured at his new home in the Safari-park in Gelenzhik, underwent a change in diet and was put in a special glass enclosure to stop him smoking and drinking . Detox: As well as changing his diet, keepers at the safari park introduced new exercise equipment to help John improve his unhealthy lifestyle . Mr Skorsky added: 'We have developed for him a special diet of fresh fruit and established sports equipment (in his enclosure). 'Now he is cheerful and full of energy and I think (he) was completely rehabbed, getting rid of bad habits.' John is not the first chimpanzee to develop an addiction to tobacco. Charlie, a chimp at Bloemfontein Zoo in South Africa, found fame with his habit of enjoying the odd cigarette. New lifestyle: The chimpanzee is said to have more energy and is more cheerful according to safari park bosses . His keepers said that he developed the vice when visitors to the zoo kept handing him lit cigarettes. But despite his smoking, Charlie actually lived ten years longer than the average chimp living in captivity.

"The number of poor people in America is 3 million higher than the official count, encompassing 1 in 6 residents due to out-of-pocket medical costs and work-related expenses, according to a revised census measure released Wednesday. The new measure is aimed at providing a fuller picture of poverty, but does not replace the official government numbers. Put in place two years ago by the Obama administration, it generally is considered more reliable by social scientists because it factors in living expenses as well as the effects of government aid, such as food stamps and tax credits. Administration officials have declined to say whether the new measure eventually could replace the official poverty formula, which is used to allocate federal dollars to states and localities and to determine eligibility for safety-net programs, such as Medicaid. Congress would have to agree to adopt the new measure, which generally would result in a higher poverty rate from year to year and thus higher government payouts for aid programs. Based on the revised formula, the number of poor people in 2012 was 49.7 million, or 16 percent. That exceeds the record 46.5 million, or 15 percent, that was officially reported in September. One of 49.7 million: A homeless woman sits on a street in Chicago. New Census survey says the official rate of poverty in America is astronomically higher than what is officially recorded . Statistics: The new Census report details the factors stopping people from getting out of poverty as well as the ones causing them to fall into it . The latest numbers come as more working-age adults picked up low-wage jobs in the slowly improving economy but still struggled to pay living expenses. Americans 65 and older had the largest increases in poverty under the revised formula, from 9.1 percent to 14.8 percent, because of medical expenses such as Medicare premiums, deductibles and other costs not accounted for in the official rate. There also were increases for Hispanics and Asian-Americans, partly due to lower participation among immigrants and non-English speakers in government aid programs such as housing aid and food stamps. African-Americans and children, helped by government benefits, had declines in poverty compared with the official rate. 'This is a real incongruity, when 1 in 6 people face economic insecurity here in the richest country in the world,' said Joseph Stiglitz, a Columbia University economist and former chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, who has argued for more government action to alleviate income inequality. 'When so many citizens are worse off year after year, with food insecurity and health care insecurity, there's no way you can say that's a successful economy.' Last week, more than 47 million Americans who receive food stamps saw their benefits go down, while Congress began negotiations on further cuts of up to $4 billion annually to the program. Elijah Brooks, 6, (left) and sister Elisha Brooks, 4, (right) help their parents on an assembly line of food for the needy at the Orange County Food Bank in Garden Grove, California. New figures say the state has the highest level of poor people . Among states, California had the highest share of poor people, hurt in part by high housing costs and large numbers of immigrants, followed by the District of Columbia, Nevada and Florida. Under the official poverty rate, more rural states were more likely to be at the top of list, led by Mississippi, Louisiana and New Mexico. Some other findings were: . - Food stamps helped lift about 5 million people above the poverty line. Without such aid, the overall poverty rate would increase from 16 percent to 17.6 percent. - Working-age adults ages 18-64 saw an increase in poverty from 13.7 percent based on the official calculation to 15.5 percent, due mostly to commuting and child care costs. - Child poverty declined from 22.3 percent to 18 percent under the new measure. Under both measures, children still remained the age group most likely to be living in poverty. - By race, Hispanics and Asians saw higher rates of poverty, 27.8 percent and 16.7 percent respectively, compared with rates of 25.8 percent and 11.8 percent under the official formula. In contrast, African-Americans saw a modest decrease, from 27.3 percent to 25.8 percent based on the revised numbers. Among non-Hispanic whites, poverty rose from 9.8 percent to 10.7 percent. 'The primary reason that poverty remains so high is that the benefits of a growing economy are no longer being shared by all workers as they were in the quarter-century following the end of World War II,' said Sheldon Danziger, a University of Michigan economist. Making it work: A street dweller uses the power outlet of a vending machine to use his laptop outside a supermarket. A new study says that 1 in 6 Americans are poor . 'Given current economic conditions, poverty will not be substantially reduced unless government does more to help the working poor and those who are willing to work but cannot find jobs. We must also expand the reach of our safety-net programs.' Economists long have criticized the official poverty rate as inadequate. Based on a half-century-old government formula, the official rate continues to assume the average family spends one-third of its income on food. Those costs have declined to a much smaller share, more like one-seventh. In reaction to some of the criticism, the Obama administration in 2010 asked the Census Bureau to develop a new poverty measure, based partly on recommendations made by the National Academy of Sciences. The goal is to help lawmakers better gauge the effectiveness of anti-poverty programs. For instance, the new measure finds that if it weren't for Social Security payments, the poverty rate would rise to 54.7 percent for people 65 and older and 24.5 percent for all age groups. Refundable tax credits such as the earned income tax credit helped lift 9 million people above the poverty line. Without the credits, child poverty would rise from 18 percent to 24.7 percent.","Last government census recorded the number of poor people across the country as 46.5 million .

"The Pope’s new right-hand man has called for ‘discussion’ on the issue of celibacy within the Catholic Church. Archbishop Pietro Parolin, the new secretary of state of the Vatican, told Venezuelan newspaper El Universal that celibacy is tradition rather than law, and should be open to discussion. He said the Church must ‘reflect the democratic spirit of the times’ and take the opinions of its members into account. Archbishop Pietro Parolin, Pope Francis' (pictured) right hand man, has called for a discussion on celibacy for priests .

It can change. 'Personally, it never crossed my mind to marry.' It is not the first time the issue has arisen. In 1970, nine German theologians, including Joseph Ratzinger (the future Pope Benedict XVI), signed a letter calling for a new discussion of the law of celibacy.

"Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said workers would be £400 a year better off if the personal allowance was raised to £12,500 . Workers on the minimum wage will not have to pay any tax, under plans revealed by the Liberal Democrats today. The party wants to increase the point at which income tax kicks in to £12,500  – meaning anyone working full time on £6.50 an hour would avoid the levy. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said the Lib Dems also wanted to raise the point at which workers start paying National Insurance. Workers currently start paying national insurance on earnings above £153 a week, or £7,956 a year, at a rate of 12 per cent. The Lib Dems say they hope to raise this to £12,500 by the end of the next parliament in 2020 – bringing national insurance contributions into line with income tax. The Chancellor George Osborne announced in his budget in March that the personal tax allowance would be raised to £10,000 this year. He also announced that this would be increased to £10,500 next year. Raising the personal tax allowance would cut income tax for 30 million workers and be worth £400 per year to a typical basic rate taxpayer, the Lib Dems have claimed. It would also see more than six million pensioners benefiting, according to Mr Alexander. He said: ‘That's why cutting income tax for working people, particularly those on low and middle incomes, is a top Liberal Democrat priority. ‘It was on the front page of the 2010 Liberal Democrat manifesto and we have fought to keep it on the agenda at every budget. ‘By April next year we will have delivered a tax cut to over 26 million people worth £800 a year to a typical basic rate taxpayer and taken over three million out of tax altogether. ‘Now we want to go even further and lift the amount of money people can earn before paying income tax to £12,500. ‘The Liberal Democrats are the only party in British politics with a long-term commitment to cutting taxes for the working people of Britain.’ George Osborne, outside Number 11 before the budget in March this year, has tried to claim credit for increasing the personal allowance. But the Lib Dems say the policy would not have been introduced without them . He added: ‘We've delivered the largest programme of tax cuts for a generation over the last four years, despite all of the other financial pressures. ‘These manifesto commitments will mean nothing less than a generational shift to a fairer tax system that rewards work and helps working people. ‘That's the way to build a stronger economy and a fairer society and ensure that everyone has the opportunity to get on in life.’","Lib Dems vow to raise starting point for income tax to £12,500 from £10,000 .

Workers currently start paying NI on earnings above  £8,000 a year .

"Samantha Lewthwaite – the ‘White Widow’ being hunted in the wake of the Nairobi mall massacre – is secretly married to a former officer in the Kenyan Navy, a confidential Scotland Yard file on her reveals. The dossier throws new light on the shadowy world of the mother of four who converted to Islam as a schoolgirl and is now the world’s most wanted woman. As well as being the suspected mastermind behind the Westgate mall attack, which killed 67 people and left 71 missing and 200 injured, she is sought for earlier plots in her role as a major player in Al Qaeda’s Somali offshoot, Al Shabaab. New union: Samantha Lewthwaite, pictured in a selfie from a personal computer found by police at the house she was renting in Mombasa, is  married to a Kenyan former Navy officer . Muslim convert Lewthwaite, 29, widow of 7/7 suicide bomber Jermaine Lindsay, left Britain for Africa with her children in 2009 and has been on the run for 20 months. But a Mail on Sunday investigation can reveal that her current husband – a man named Abdi Wahid who in  his 40s – has been free to travel as  he wishes, and is currently in continental Europe. Wahid was arrested in 2011 when police discovered that his house in the coastal city of Mombasa had been turned into a potential bomb factory by Lewthwaite and her associates. He was never charged with any offence. Exactly how much he knew of his wife’s clandestine activities is not clear but detectives now believe he could hold the key to unlocking her network of terror. It is not known exactly when their marriage took place, but Lewthwaite had evidently left her old life in  Britain behind by then and was deeply involved with Al Shabaab. A grainy image taken from Lewthwaite's computer shows a man holding a baby, believed to be her youngest daughter Surajah, which could be the child's father . Police say Wahid is likely to have a better knowledge of Lewthwaite’s travels and contacts and, most of all, her possible current whereabouts than anyone. His relationship with Lewthwaite has baffled detectives, given his military background and because he once worked as a private security officer in Afghanistan, guarding westerners against attack from the Taliban. Previously he has been described as Lewthwaite’s ‘landlord’ at one of two houses where she stayed in Mombasa until she came to police attention in January 2012. But the dossier leaves no room for doubt that Lewthwaite is or was  ‘married to’ Wahid, making his freedom to travel at will all the more  surprising. It is believed he has another Muslim wife in Mombasa. Lewthwaite’s two elder children, nine-year-old Abdullah and Ruqayyah, eight, both by Lindsay, have the middle names Shaheed and Shahidah, respectively, which means ‘martyr’ in the male and female form, according to the police data. It is not clear who fathered her two younger children, four-year-old Abdur-Rahman and Surajah, three,  though it is believed that at one stage Lewthwaite was in a relationship with another British Al Shabaab recruit, Hounslow-born Habib Saleh Ghani, 28. He is thought to have been killed earlier this month in Somalia following a gunfight with a rival group. The police file, codenamed Operation Unigof, includes an ‘association chart’. At its centre are Lewthwaite and British terror suspect Jermaine Grant, 30, from Newham, East London. He is a Muslim convert who knew Lewthwaite’s husband Lindsay, and is currently on trial in Mombasa on explosives charges. There are extensive details of all the mobile phone numbers linked with Lewthwaite, along with calls  she has made to a woman, described in a police file as her ‘aunt’, at an address in Solihull, Birmingham. Last week the woman, who recently married, was on holiday and could not be contacted. Exactly what her relationship is to Irish-born Lewthwaite, the daughter of a Northern Irish Catholic mother and a British soldier, is unclear, but there is no suggestion she had anything to do with her activities. The police document suggests that Lewthwaite may have called the ‘aunt’ from Kenya as many as 42 times – the last four in November 2011 and January 2012, shortly before she went on the run. All the calls went to voicemail. The Yard file was compiled in the days following Lewthwaite’s narrow escape from police in 2011, a story that can now be revealed fully for the first time. The first arrest in the chain of events came in December 2011 when Grant was detained with another man at the Mombasa  house owned by Abdi Wahis, a few miles from the house Lewthwaite was living in. At Grant’s place, police found ingredients needed to make a bomb – hydrogen peroxide and ammonium nitrate, as well as batteries and  electrical switches. A Kenyan Police source told The Mail on Sunday that after being held in a cell without food for three days,  Grant finally talked. He told the officers that they should be talking to his ‘boss’ – a white woman – and supplied addresses, including the property where Lewthwaite was staying. Sharing the other house with Lewthwaite was Nassim Salim, 27, the widow of Mussa Hussein Abdi, an Al Qaeda agent killed in Mogadishu in 2011. Yet when officers raided the house, Lewthwaite convinced them that she was a South African named Natalie Faye Webb. She had a bogus passport, obtained by using another woman’s birth certificate. Mujahideen mum: An image of Lewthwaite, who has named two of her children for the Arab word for 'martyr', seen with a baby, believed to be her youngest child . A bag of money with thousands of pounds worth of assorted foreign currencies was also found at the house, but even that wasn’t suspicious enough to persuade the police to bring her in. Instead, they took a copy of the passport and left. When they updated Scotland Yard, one of the London detectives realised that the woman posing as Natalie Webb was Lewthwaite. The Kenyans returned to the house the next day, but she had gone. Before her escape she had tried to destroy her laptop by smashing it, but a few days later a Metropolitan Police unit was able to retrieve vital data from it. Among photographs on the laptop was one of her holding a baby. It is believed to show her youngest child Surajah, born in  July 2010. In another photograph an unidentified man – possibly the father – is seen holding the baby. Also found was an exercise book in which Lewthwaite had begun writing a book, based on interviews with fellow ‘Mujahideen’. She related how she had asked her elder children what they wanted to be when they grew up and both answered ‘holy warriors’. Further investigations showed that Lewthwaite had entered Kenya from Tanzania on February 26, 2011, and that in 2010 and 2011 she had spent several months in Johannesburg working as an IT specialist at a Halal meat factory, posing as Natalie Webb. The real Natalie Webb is a nurse who emigrated from South Africa to Essex. The last recorded use of the false passport was in February 2011, before it was cancelled – the month that Lewthwaite entered Kenya. l Samantha Lewthwaite’s mother, Christine Allen, is desperate to see her grandchildren, her extended family have said. Her plea came through Jermaine Lindsay’s mother, Maryam Mcleod Ismaiyl, who told The Mail on Sunday yesterday: ‘I have not heard from [Samantha] since 2009. I spoke to her mother via email and she said she had not heard from her either. ‘Her mother is very upset and she wants to see her grandchildren.’ Speaking from her home in Grenada, Mrs Ismaiyl added: ‘Samantha was married to my son. She tried to help keep me in contact with my grandchildren but we would only speak briefly over the phone. ‘She appeared to become stranger after his funeral. Now I have no idea where they are.’ She added: ‘These people in Kenya who carried out this criminal behaviour will get their punishment and they should, because criminal behaviour is not Islamic behaviour.’ Online war: Samantha Lewthwaite, pictured in her school year book, taunted her rival on Twitter . A chilling set of tweets believed to . be by ‘White Widow’ Samantha Lewthwaite show her taunting a rival before . he was ambushed and murdered in cold blood. The . messages then show her gloating over the rival’s death, saying: ‘Can’t . say I’m shedding tears’ and accepting ‘what has been dished out to him’. Muslim convert Lewthwaite is believed to have been involved in the Nairobi terror attacks. She has been on the run since January 2012 when she was accused of a bomb plot targeting tourist resorts in Mombasa, Kenya. Her Twitter feed, MYC Press Office, shows her allegiance to Ahmed Abdi . Godane, the new leader of the Somali terrorist group Al Shabaab, which . ordered the Nairobi atrocity. Godane . – who has a £4.5 million FBI bounty on his head – was recently accused . of killing rivals within his own group to assert his authority. One was a . terrorist called Omar Shafik Hammami, also known as Abu Manzoor . Al-Amriki. Al-Amriki and . Lewthwaite had a Twitter spat in April, in which he dismissed her for . ‘just being a girl in Kenya’. Lewthwaite responded: ‘Yes, am a girl in . Kenya like dat [that] makes a difference u misogynist.’ She then called . Al-Amriki an ‘irritating, obnoxious, contemptible little muj prat’. ‘Muj’ is short for mujahideen (jihadi warrior). Lewthwaite . continued her spat with Al-Amriki, which came to a deadly end when he . was ambushed in southern Somalia last month and killed. Afterwards, Lewthwaite tweeted: ‘I’m waiting in anticipation of information on Amriki. Can’t say I’m shedding tears.’ She . later added: ‘I feel a pinch of sadness but as one who believes in . jihad & supports Amir Godane I accept what has been dished out to . Al-Amriki.’","Samantha Lewthwaite is married to a former officer in the Kenyan Navy .

"Relatives of those killed in the July 7 bombings joined survivors for an emotional ceremony to remember the 52 people who died nine years ago today. A minute's silence was held at the 7/7 memorial in London's Hyde Park this lunchtime before the name of each of those killed in the terror attacks was read out. More than 150 people attended the service and sent a defiant message to the vandals who defaced the memorial in the early of hours of this morning. Scroll down for video . Families of those killed in the 7/7 attacks on London nine years ago lay flowers on the memorial in Hyde Park . An emotional ceremony was held to remember the 52 people who did not come home on July 7, 2005 . Elizabeth Nicholson remembered her sister Jennifer, who died at Edgware Road underground station . The memorial's stainless steel columns had been daubed with red and black slogans overnight with the messages '4Innocent Muslims', 'Blair Lied Thousands Died' and 'J7 Truth'. But, after park workers moved in to quickly clean up the spray paint, families arrived to remember their loved ones. Four . suicide bombers detonated rucksack devices in four locations in the capital on . the morning of July 7 2005, killing the 52 and injuring hundreds of . others, some seriously. Remembering the attacks, Del Penberthy, duty manager at Edgware Road tube station where one of the bombs went off, said today: 'It was the worst day of my life. 'And the next week, and two weeks, and so on. But the response of everybody was amazing, as it was said in the speeches, off-duty staff, cleaners and everybody stopped their lunches, or whatever, to try and help out. 'I was one of the first down there and at first I thought it had derailed but as we got down there you could smell something like gun powder in the air. It was dark, and smoky but we tried to the best of our abilities to help out.' Families covered the memorial, which lists the names of those who died, in flowers during the service . Those who attended the injured after the blast described the day as the worst of their lives . A minute's silence was held before the name of each those killed was read out . Many who attended said they would not be bowed by the actions of vandals who had tried to ruin the event by covering the memorial in graffiti last night. Elizabeth Nicholson, whose sister, Jennifer, was killed in the Edgware Road bomb, said the event was a means for people to 'show their love' for the victims and she had no interest in the apparent graffiti protest. 'I have no interest in dwelling on it (the vandalism) it is not something I consider to be important. I am here for my sister, I want to celebrate her,' she said at the ceremony. 'She was very beautiful, vivacious, and full of life. She had a smile that if she walked into a room, it would light it up. She was such a beautiful human being. It feels like part of me has been ripped away. 'It is something that does not change, it is not a feeling that diminishes with time, it becomes part of your life.' Mick Ellis, deputy assistant commissioner of the London Fire Brigade, added: 'It is a travesty that somebody tried to turn a memorial into a political event, it is not about politics it is about remembering. 'But Transport for London, Royal Parks, and the Met police have done a fantastic job of cleaning it up. 'I think the message is that we all had the terrible experience of July 7 and then the next attacks just weeks later. But we got through it, and like today it shows that London will not be beaten.' In the early hours of this morning, vandals spray-painted the memorial to the victims of the 7/7 London bombings ahead of the ninth anniversary of the attacks which left 52 dead . Park workers rushed to clean the memorial, which was visited by victims' families today, and police say they are examining CCTV footage as part of an investigation into the vandalism . Cleaners used hoses to remove the red and black paint from the names of those killed in the attacks . Ros . Morley, whose 52-year-old husband Colin died when the bomb went off at . Edgware Road, told of her sadness at the vandalism, but said she would . not let it affect her. She said: 'It is sad that someone could stoop so low, to damage something that represents such a tragic event in the history of London. 'People have to pay their respects, so they (the culprits) should have thought before they acted in a terrible way.' 'I won't let it affect me, I'm looking past that, someone acted in a thoughtless way. I . would say to the person who did this to think before they act. I would . like them to think how they would feel if they were going to pay their . respects to a loved one?' A . spokeswoman for the Royal Parks said the slogans had been removed . after they were discovered early this morning by the park's manager. She said: 'We found it this morning. It has now been removed and the memorial can go ahead as planned. Obviously, we are very disappointed.' John Falding, whose partner Anat Rosenberg, a 39-year-old charity worker, was killed in the Tavistock Square bus bomb, also condemned the vandalism. He said: 'It is quite shocking, whoever did it was aiming for publicity and to cause maximum grief.' After graffiti was discovered early this morning, cleaners moved in to remove the paint before the ceremony . High-pressure equipment was brought by the team tasked with removing the vandalism, which London Mayor Boris Johnson said had left him 'shocked and saddened' The memorial hosted a ceremony today to remember those who died in the bombings nine years ago . He said he would not be attending the event today but would be observing the anniversary privately. The . monument honouring the 52 dead in the attack on London's transport . system in 2005 cost nearly £1 million and has 52 stainless steel . columns, which are 11.5ft tall. It . was unveiled in 2009 at a memorial attended by the Prince of Wales, the . then Prime Minister Gordon Brown and other political leaders. The . columns are grouped together in four clusters, reflecting the separate . locations of the bombings - Tavistock Square, Edgware Road, King's Cross . and Aldgate. A ceremony took place at the . memorial at midday today when survivors of the four blasts as well as those who went to help them spoke to those gathered. A minute's silence was held before . the names of each of the 52 people who died were read out. Floral . tributes were also laid at the memorial. A . spokesman for ceremony organisers,The Tim Parry Johnathan Ball . Foundation for Peace, said: 'It's disappointing that someone felt like . they had to do this but everyone has rallied around to get it cleared up . and that's what London's about. 'This is a day for the families and the survivors and we are pleased that it's still able to go ahead.' Victims' families said they were determined not to let the vandalism overshadow a poignant day for them . Londoners stopped and laid flowers in Tavistock Square this morning, the site of one of the bombings .

"Prisons have spent almost £1million hiring interpreters for the burgeoning population of foreign criminals in British jails. New figures for jails in England and Wales show that interpreters were needed 14,138 times last year. Twelve per cent of prisoners in English and Welsh jails are foreign, with Polish, Irish and Jamaican inmates the most common. Call-outs: Government figures show interpreters were called on almost 15,000 times last year . Each interpreter visit can cost the taxpayer as much as £1,200, leading to claims the cost of the justice system could 'spiral out of control', the Sun reported. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) figures were brought to light by a Parliamentary question from Labour MP Jim Cunningham. They showed that the MoJ spent £994,000 on the visit. But HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire made 148 call-outs, with a total cost of £182,180.50 - £1,230.95 a time. In the same period of time, HMP Manchester called them out 635 times, costing £50,444.73, which equates to £79.44 per visit. A TaxPayers' Alliance spokesman said: 'Everyone deserves access to justice, but costs can't spiral out of control. 'It doesn't make sense that some prisons are costing nearly £200,000 for fewer interpreters than one spending £50,000.' Population: Roughly one in eight prisoners is foreign - with Polish, Irish and Jamaican inmates most common . Costs for translators in court are also soaring. It was revealed in May that the bill for court interpreters doubled in a single year to more than £15million. The leap in costs came after the Ministry of Justice outsourced the work to an external firm - with 'shambolic' consequences. A committee of MPs was told that in one case a murder trial had to be halted when a translator revealed he was in fact an unqualified stand-in for his wife. Some courts have also been reduced to relying on Google's online translation services to administer justice.","Government figures showed bill for translators hit £994,000 last year .

"Islamic State militants have 'massacred' at least 80 Yazidis after they refused to convert to Islam, it has been claimed. The insurgents allegedly stormed into the small village of Kojo in northern Iraq, where they spent five days trying to persuade villagers to take up their religion. When they refused, the male members of the ancient sect were reportedly rounded up and shot dead, while more than 100 women and girls were kidnapped. Scroll down for video . Terrified: Islamic State militants have 'massacred' at least 80 Yazidis after they refused to convert to Islam, it has been claimed. Above, displaced Yazidis shelter are seen at a park near the Turkey-Iraq border yesterday . 'They arrived in vehicles and they . started their killing this afternoon,' senior Kurdish official Hoshiyar . Zebari told Reuters yesterday. 'We believe it's because of their creed: convert or . be killed.' The women and girls abducted from the village, situated around 12 miles south of Sinjar, were being taken to the ISIS-controlled cities of Mosul and Tal Afar, the official said. It comes as the Islamic State's continued push to the border with the Kurdish region has sparked a series of U.S. airstrikes and sent tens of thousands of Yazidis and Christians fleeing for their lives. Yesterday, Yazidi parliamentarian Mahama Khalil said the alleged massacre had taken place during a one-hour period. Waiting: Members of Yazidi community rest as they try to cross to Turkey, in Zakho, 300 miles north of Baghdad .

'He told me that the Islamic State . had spent five days trying to persuade villagers to convert to Islam and . that a long lecture was delivered about the subject today,' said the . villager. 'He then said the men were gathered . and shot dead. The women and girls were probably taken to Tal Afar . because that is where the foreign fighters are.' However, the account could not be independently confirmed. Islamic State militants have killed at least 500 members of Iraq's Yazidi ethnic minority during their offensive in the north, according to Iraq's human rights minister. Panic: It comes as the Islamic State's continued push to the border with the Kurdish region has sparked a series of U.S. airstrikes and sent tens of thousands of Yazidis and Christians fleeing for their lives . Hidden away: Yazidis who fled the violence from ISIS forces in Sinjar shelter on Mount Sinjar earlier this week . Mohammed Shia al-Sudani said the Sunni militants had also buried some of their victims alive, including women and children. Some 300 women were kidnapped as slaves, he added. Meanwhile, American military officials last night claimed airstrikes from drones destroyed two . armed vehicles south of the Iraqi town of Sinjar. In a statement, U.S. Central Command said Kurdish forces had . reported that Islamic State militants were attacking civilians in the . village of Kawju. Officials said remotely piloted aircraft identified and then followed an . armed vehicle to a roadside area near Sanjar, before striking and destroying two vehicles in the area. Sick: British jihadist Nasser Muthana posted this claim on his Twitter account saying that he and other Islamic State fighters had captured hundreds of Yazidi and were holding them hostage in Syria . Jihadist: Nasser Muthana is a 20-year-old former Cardiff schoolboy who featured prominently in the Islamic State's first professionally produced English language propaganda video . It comes just days after a British jihadist made sick claims on Twitter that Islamic State militants are holding hundreds of Iraqi women as slaves in Syria. Former Cardiff schoolboy Nasser Muthana appeared to refer to reports that 300 women were snatched from the Yazidi community near Mount Sinjar, where ISIS cornered thousands of refugees in a ten-day siege. The tweet also alluded to claims that the women were intended to be given to young jihadists as wives. It read: 'I can confirm that we have hundreds of yazidi slave women now in Syria, how about that for news!' Before: Former Cardiff schoolboy Nasser Muthana uploaded images with the stark warning: 'Army base buildings before and after, I'm getting good with these bombs' When his claims were questioned by a known sympathiser, he sounded more sincere. Da Masked Avenger asked him: 'In all seriousness. What's the truth of this matter?' Muthana replied: 'I'm not lying.' The message was posted on Wednesday, but has since been deleted and his claims cannot be independently verified. Fears are now growing for the captured women amid claims they could be used to bear children to break up the Kurdish-speaking group's bloodline. After: The young jihadist, who describes himself on Twitter as a 'soldier of the Islamic State', said last month the UK government should be 'afraid' of his bomb-making skills . The minority group is originally Aryan . and has retained a fairer complexion, blonde hair and blue eyes by only . marrying within the community. But in a furious bid to convert all non-Muslims, ISIS jihadists have vowed to impregnate the hostages. Addressing . the kidnapping, Adnan Kochar, chairman of the Kurdish Cultural Centre . in London, told MailOnline: 'The Kurds and Yazidis are originally . Aryans. 'But because . the Yazidis are such a closed community they have retained a fairer . complexion, blonder hair and bluer eyes. They don't marry non-Yazidis. 'ISIS . have taken around 300 women from Sinjar to give to jihadists to marry . and make pregnant to have a Muslim child. If they can't kill all . Yazidis, they will try to smash the blond bloodline.' Threat: Nasser Muthana posted a message on Twitter last month warning that the UK government should be afraid of him returning to the country with his new bomb making skills . Find: Muthana claims to have found this prayer mat inside the army base. He says it offers devotion to the Prophet Mohammed's daughter and is therefore in breach of Islamic law as evidence of practicing idolatry . Muthana . - who featured in a chilling ISIS recruitment video - has been a . prolific user of social media in recent months, posting horrific . pictures of mutilated Iraqi soldiers and other taunting claims about the . Islamic State's uprising in Iraq. He has previously warned that ISIS fighters would slaughter any Yazidi men they captured in northern Iraq and would enslave their women and children. 'Kuffar [non-believers] are afraid we . will slaughter Yazidis, our deen [religious path] is clear we will kill . their men, take their women and children as slaves insha Allah,' he posted on Twitter. He also posted a message on Twitter warning that . the UK government should be afraid of him returning to the country with . his new bomb making skills. Friends: Reyaad Khan (left), who is also from Cardiff, appeared alongside Muthana (right) in the ISIS propaganda video, urging other young Muslims in the West to join them in jihad . The 20-year-old's boast about the Yazidi . women came just days after he uploaded before and after images of a . military building being destroyed by one of homemade bombs. They appeared on his new Twitter page under the username Abul Muthanna@abulmuthanna313 after deleting his previous profile last month. He . was reportedly unhappy with the high levels of attention it received . following his appearance in the Islamic State's recruitment video. Formerly . a prospective medical student, Muthana was joined in Syria by his . younger brother Aseel, 17, who has now spoken of his willingness to die . fighting for ISIS. The . Muthana brothers, who grew up in Cardiff after their father moved there . from Yemen as a teenager, are among hundreds of young men from Britain . who have flown to Syria to join the rebels. Their friend Reyaad Khan, 20, also from Cardiff, said he had 'fireworks' for the U.S. if they returned to fight in Iraq. Reyaad Khan and Nasser Muthana are among the British jihadists fighting with ISIS in Iraq that are using social networking sites to lure young Muslim teenagers from the UK into joining the Islamic State fanatics. The extremists, who boast of ‘slaughtering’ innocent Yazidis and ‘taking their women as slaves’, are advising 15-year-olds that they are ‘not too young’ to die fighting for Allah. Asked by a British 18-year-old girl if she is too young to join, one of them replied: ‘I know sisters younger than you. I heard of maybe 16-year-olds being here from UK. You aren’t too young.’ Before they fled: Jihadists Reyaad Khan and Nasser Muthana (circled) hand out food to the needy in Cardiff last year. Both have been tweeting about their involvement with IS while on the front line . They are informing their British ‘brothers and sisters’ every day how to make their way to Iraq, claiming they are ‘ordered’ to defy their parents and fight jihad. The British IS fighters, who refer to themselves as the ‘Baadiya Boys’ after their original base in Syria, include Khan and Muthana. The former Catholic college students have been joined on the frontline by young Muslim men and women from across the UK, including a group of five friends from Portsmouth, two of whom have already been killed.","Militants allegedly stormed into the small village of Kojo in northern Iraq .

"A 14-year-old girl has told in horrifying detail of the moment she secretly delivered her baby with a pair of scissors in the family bathroom before throttling the newborn and hiding the body in a shoe box. Cassidy Goodison, 14, has been charged as an adult with first-degree murder after police learned how she killed her child following months of disguising the pregnancy from her parents. In a video reconstruction, using a Santa Claus doll as a model for the baby, Goodison sat in the bathroom of her Florida home to show investigators what she did. Scroll down for video . Graphic: Cassidy Goodison, 14, shows how she killed her baby by demonstrating on a Santa Claus doll at her Florida home . Horrifying: Goodison renacted the moment she choked her baby to death in September at her home . The new evidence was released last week as part of the capital murder case against her. Police had the teenager reconstruct how she had allegedly killed her child, using a Santa Claus doll as the baby. On the ABC clip, she said: 'Its eyes weren’t open but I felt to see if it was breathing or not, and (it was breathing) so I put my hands around its throat to make it stop breathing.' Goodison went into labor in her home in . Greenbrier Village, Florida on September 19 and instead of calling for . help, disguised her screams of pain by running the tap and gripping a . towel between her teeth as she sat on the toilet. After prising the 9.5lb boy from her . body with a pair of  scissors, she felt for a pulse and then strangled the boy . to death and hid his corpse in a shoe box with dirty laundry. When asked by police how hard she squeezed, the girl said: 'Enough for it to stop breathing.' Three . days later, as Teresa Goodson cleaned her daughter's room, a foul odor . drew her attention to a pile of soiled, wet clothes in which she found . the deceased infant hidden in a box. Secrets: Goodison told police she was frightened of telling her parents she was pregnant . An autopsy performed determined the . victim was a full term infant and that he was alive and breathing prior . to death. He died as a result of asphyxia from strangulation and blunt . force trauma. Miss Goodson had gone to great lengths to hide the transformation of her 5ft 3in 100lb body during pregnancy, according to Polk County officials. Throughout the summer, as she walked around in baggy sweat pant and loose-fitting T-shirts. Members of her family grew suspicious of her appearance and attempted to discuss the possibility she was pregnant with the teen's mother. But Mrs Goodson denied the suggestions,  said the report, claiming that she had made her daughter do two home tests, albeit in the privacy of her bathroom, which both came out negative. Husband Timothy Goodson agreed meanwhile that he had noticed Miss Goodson's weight gain and that she had been walking around at home wrapped in a blanket. An interview with the teenager on September 22 revealed that after the 14-year-old had delivered the 9.5lb, 20.4in boy into the toilet, she had felt for a pulse and then strangled him to death. Facing life in prison:The 14-year-old has been charged with first-degree murder in Florida . Confirming he was dead by once again checking his pulse, she then cleaned herself and the baby and tucked the evidence out of sight. Shortly after, however, Mrs Goodson noticed blood in the toilet she knew had been recently used by her daughter so took her to Lakeland Regional Medical Center. There medical staff treating the high school student told Mrs Goodson that she had suffered a miscarriage and showed four to five lacerations on her vaginal wall. Though these injuries were in reality self-inflicted when the teenager had pried the baby out of her with a pair of scissors, she falsely confessed to her mother that she had indeed had a miscarriage at home and flushed the fetus down the toilet by mistake. Hidden: The teenager hid the dead baby in a shoebox which was found by her mother when she was cleaning . Polk County Sheriff's Office deputies, along with members of the Department of Children and Families responded to a call from the hospital reporting the case and details were retained by the PCSO Bureau of Criminal Investigations for follow up investigations. 'This is the most perplexing, confusing, disheartening case I've ever seen in my 18 years on this job' Police spokesman . According to the Sheriff's Office affidavit, on the evening of September 22, at approximately 7.30pm, Mrs Goodson removed a bag of smelly, wet clothing from a storage stool in her daughter's bedroom. While sorting through the clothing she found the body of the baby concealed in the shoe box. In a panic, Mrs Goodson called her sisters who in turn alerted the police. Miss Goodson told detectives she was motivated to hide her pregnancy and choke the baby 'to stop him from breathing,' by the fear that her relationship with her parents would change if they found out the truth. Life-changing: The teenager could be sentenced to life after the death of her baby . Miss Goodson was arrested and transported first to the Juvenile Assessment Center and then to the Polk County Juvenile Detention Facility. She is charged with premeditated first degree murder, a capital felony and aggravated child abuse, a first degree felony. Polk County Public Information officer, Donna Wood, told MailOnline: 'This is the most perplexing, confusing, disheartening case I've ever seen in my 18 years on this job. Everyone has been touched by it.'","Cassidy Goodison 'delivered baby boy in bathroom and strangled him'

"Tunisian women who have travelled to Syria to offer themselves to Islamist fighters are returning home pregnant with rebels' children, it has been revealed. A Tunisian government minister told members of parliament this week the women, who are waging 'sexual jihad', are 'having sexual relations with 20,30,100' men before returning to Tunisia pregnant. Interior Minister Lotfi ben Jeddou made the revelations at the National Constituent Assembly on Thursday, though didn't elaborate on the number of women who have returned in this condition. Tunisian women who travelled to Syria to offer themselves to Islamist opposition fighters in sexual jihad are returning pregnant, a government minister has claimed . 'After the sexual liaisons they have there in the name of 'jihad . al-nikah' -- (sexual holy war, in Arabic) -- they come home pregnant,' he said. Jihad al-nikah, permitting extramarital sexual relations with multiple . partners, is considered by some hardline Sunni Muslim Salafists as a . legitimate form of holy war. The minister also did not say how many Tunisian women were thought to . have gone to Syria for such a purpose, although media reports have said . hundreds have done so, France 24 revealed. However, . Ben Jeddou also said that since he assumed office in March, 'six . thousand of our young people have been prevented from going' to the . country. He has said in the past that border controls have been boosted to intercept young Tunisians seeking to travel to Syria. Earlier this year a group of Tunisian girls travelled to rebel-held Northern Syria to offer themselves to opposition fighters. Their action came after growing in concern in Tunisia about religious orders or 'fatwas' that circulated the internet calling on Muslim women to perform jihad through sex. A Tunisian minister of religious affairs appealed to girls at the time not to be influenced by Islamic preachers outside of Tunisia who made a number of 'sexual fatwas'. Noureddine al-Khadimi rejected 'sexual jihad' fatwas, urging Tunisian people and state institutions to not respond to them. Free Syrian Army fighters man an anti-aircraft gun on a truck in the village of Aziza, in the southern countryside of Aleppo . Tunisian newspapers reported that a young Tunisian man divorced his wife, and that they both headed to Syria almost a month ago to 'allow her to engage in sexual jihad with the mujahideen' there. This report followed earlier ones of a video widely circulated on the internet and social websites in Tunisia shows the parents of a veiled girl called Rahmah, 17. They said Rahmahat disappeared from home one morning and they 'later learned that she had headed to Syria to carry out sexual jihad.' The young girl has since returned to her family, who have kept her out of sight, and said that their daughter is not a religious fanatic 'but was influenced by her fellow students who are known for their affiliation with the jihadist Salafist.' Free Syrian Army fighters fire their weapons during clashes with what activists say are government forces, in the village of Aziza, in the southern countryside of Aleppo . Her parents said these fellow students may have brainwashed her and convinced her to travel to Syria 'to support the mujahideen there.' News websites and social networks in Tunisia circulated a fatwa attributed to Sheikh Mohamed al-Arifi  in which he called upon 'Muslim women' to perform jihad through sex. However, sources close to the sheikh denied that he had issued the fatwa, stressing that anyone who circulates or believes it is insane. Saudi Arabia was widely considered to be financially backing the Syrian rebels fighting in Northern Syria and whose hardcore ‘Salafist’ strand of Islam influences a great number of the young fighters – many of whom are ‘jihadists’ and come from all around the world, including the UK. Reports in Tunisia stressed though that the fatwa had gained much attention on pro-Syrian regime websites, the goal of which may be to tarnish the image of the Islamic fighters by stressing a key point of Syrian leader Bashar Al Assad that fundamentalists, supported by Salafist groups in Saudi Arabia, are amongst the Syrian rebels. Al-Hadi Yahmad, a researcher on the affairs of Islamic groups, told Al-Hayat: 'The issue of sexual jihad was initially attributed to a Saudi sheikh who denied it, and this fatwa is abnormal and not endorsed by religious scholars.' He added that this fatwa — had it indeed been issued — may involve Syrian girls living in Syria, who can 'support the mujahideen by marrying them for a few hours.' Under Islamic law, a man can marry and consummate a marriage with his bride, before divorcing her the next day without any resistance from the bride or her family simply by following religious etiquette. Noor Eddin al-Khadimi, said that Tunisians should not abide by the fatwa. Her calls were duplicated by the Tunisian opposition also. Salma al-Raqiq, a Tunisian opposition figure, said that the 'jihad marriages' were a disgrace for the Tunisians. She also called on the authorities to start dealing with the increasing phenomenon of Tunisian jihadis heading to Syria to join radical Islamist groups. Al-Raqiq told the UPI press agency that the phenomenon was a dangerous one. She said that young girls, including minors, have been sent to Syria to 'marry' jihadis for a few hours.","Tunisian government minister reveals women who travelled to Syria to comfort Islamist opposition fighters in sexual jihad are returning pregnant .

"Accused: Koman Willis is facing first degree murder and aggravated battery with a firearm charges after he allegedly shot dead baby Jonylah Watkins while aiming for her father, Jonathan Watkins . A 33-year-old documented gang member with 38 prior arrests has been charged in the devastating March shooting of a six-month-old Chicago girl - and police claim the alleged murder was in retaliation for a stolen video game system. Koman Willis is facing first degree murder and aggravated battery with a firearm charges after he allegedly shot dead baby Jonylah Watkins while aiming for her father, Jonathan Watkins. Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy said at a Monday press conference that Mr Watkins had earlier robbed Willis, prompting the spray of bullets. The man turned himself in on the weekend though he is yet to provide a statement and no weapon has been recovered, McCarthy said. But witness accounts and pictures of the shooter's van leaving the scene were among the evidence that led police to file the charges. 'I don't want to use cliche terms, but police were pounding the pavement,' McCarthy said, according to DNA Info. Little Jonylah was struck by a bullet on March 11 while she sat in a minivan with her father who was also shot three times but survived. Reverend Corey Brooks, who held a . emotionally-charged funeral service for the baby in March and is acting . as a spokesman for the family, said Jonylah's parents had been cooperating . with police to find their daughter's killer. Brooks . added that Watkins, 29, who has a lengthy criminal history and was criticized by the community in the wake of his daughter's death, . hadn't been asked by police to identify a possible shooter. Progress: Police said they've been pounding the pavement on the case of Jonylah Watkins, pictured . Murdered: Baby Jonylah Watkins was shot as she sat on her father, Jonathan's lap in March. She survived a separate shooting of her mother Judy when she was still in the womb . 'Jonathan has been very cooperative. He's worked with the police diligently. He wants the person to be caught,' Brooks told the Chicago Sun Times. The smiley baby was buried amid emotional scenes in a Chicago church on March 19. As the tiny body of Jonylah lay before mourners in an open coffin, Reverend Brooks, called on local gang members to change. The baby's maternal grandmother, Mary Young, also read a poem pleading for the local community to change, saying: 'My neighbors of Chicago, what have thou done?' Jonylah died on March 11 when a . bullet tore through several organs in her body in what was the second . time the infant had been a victim of gunfire: when her mother Judy, 20, . was eight months pregnant, she was shot in the knee as she walked home . with a group of women. Jonylah's father was shot multiple times in the attack that killed his daughter but survived. At . the time of the funeral, frustrated police said no-one had yet come . forward from the local community with information to help the murder . investigation. Jonylah's grandmother took the opportunity to hit out at the culture of silence in a poem she had written for the service. Change: In his March 19 eulogy Reverend Corey Brooks, pictured, called on gang members to use Jonylah's death as a catalyst to change their lifestyles . Grief: A family member is consoled during Jonylah's March 19 funeral at the New Beginnings Church in Chicago . She . said: 'My neighbors of Chicago, our youth is in danger on the streets . of the town with the false code of silence while they shoot each other . down. 'My neighbors of Chicago, take back your home. Don't spare the rod and leave your children to roam.' Reverend Brooks echoed Mrs Watkins' sentiments in his eulogy. 'I want to challenge you to get clean, change, and that change starts with believing you can change,' he said, according to yahoo.com. Jonylah had been sitting in her father's lap in the driver's seat of a parked minivan when a Willis allegedly opened fire. The . baby, whose mother was working at McDonalds at the time, died the next . morning from her wounds after surgeons spent hours trying to save her. McCarthy initially said the shooting appeared to be gang-related, though detectives didn't have a specific motive until Monday. Despite the shocking crime, neighbors were refusing to cooperate with police. 'We . don't have one individual who's stepping up to help us,' McCarthy said . in late March, though it appears the community came forward with . information and photos in the intervening months. Support: Mourners cling to each other for comfort in front of the white coffin in which Jonylah lies, in pink dress and white bonnet . Tears: Reverend Corey Brooks broke down during his eulogy, while attendees dressed in tribute to Jonylah . Respects: The church was full of mourners paying their respects to the girl who didn't make her first birthday . In March, Mr Watkins told the Chicago Sun-Times from his hospital room that he was devastated by the death of his infant daughter. 'I was trying to help. I was trying to help. I was trying to help her,' he said, breaking down. Still, he claims he has no idea who shot at them or why he was targeted. The fatal shooting came months after Jonylah's mother Judy, 20, was hit by a gunman when she was pregnant with Jonylah. Her family said Mrs Watkins was hit in the knee when she was eight months pregnant as she walked home with a group of women. Scores of people have been killed in Chicago this year - most of them victims of gang-related shootings on the south side of the city. Chicago gained national attention when its murders for January spiked to 43, the highest rate in years - making the city even more dangerous than when mobster Al Capone ruled the streets. Police initially said Mr Watkins had links to the Gangster Disciples clique though his family denies he has ties to gangs. Willis allegedly shot at the father and baby from an alley and hit Mr Watkins in the cheek and buttocks, Chicago police spokesman John Mirabelli said. The gunman then got into a nearby blue minivan and fled the scene, according to DNAinfo. Dominique Young, 21, Mr Watkins' sister, said she heard the gunfire and arrived at the van within seconds to find the windows had been shot through. She told DNAinfo: 'They knew she was in there and they tried to take my niece's life, and it's so wrong.' Reverend Brooks' church New Beginnings Church of Chicago was offering a $5,000 reward for information that leads to an arrest.It's unclear if such a tip led to the arrest. The family have called on the 'cowardly' gunman to turn himself in, which is what police say happened on the weekend.","Koman Willis, 33, is charged with first degree murder and aggravated battery with a firearm in the shooting death of six-month-old Jonylah Watkins .

"Brazil was hit by the seventh World Cup-related death yesterday after a worker fell at the stadium which will host the championship's opener in Sao Paulo. Fabio Hamilton da Cruz, whose age was not disclosed, fell about 26 feet while helping install temporary seats at the Itaquerao stadium construction company Fast Engenharia said in a statement. Firefighters said the worker fell from about 50 feet and press office of the Hospital Santa Marcelina in Sao Paulo confirmed the death, saying the worker did not survive serious head injuries. In Brazil's seventh World Cup-related death, the construction company behind the Itaquero stadium confirmed yesterday that a worker had died after falling at the site . The stadium will have a capacity of . The worker was pronounced dead just before he was expected to undergo surgery. Details on the accident were not immediately released, but Fast Engenharia said the man was wearing all the required safety equipment at the time of the fall. Brazil's sports minister, Aldo Rebelo, released a statement lamenting the death and saying officials were awaiting results from an investigation into what happened. FIFA Secretary General Jerome Valcke said on his Twitter account that he was 'deeply saddened by the tragic loss of a worker."" FIFA and the local World Cup organizing committee said in a statement that they were waiting for the official report on the death. 'For FIFA, the LOC and the Brazilian authorities safety is paramount,' the statement said. FIFA secretary Jerome Valcke tweeted his condolences to the family of the worker . The accident comes some four months after two workers died when a crane collapsed at the stadium while hoisting a 500-tonne piece of roofing. It was the eighth death at World Cup venues so far, the seventh in accidents. Three workers died in the Arena da Amazonia in the jungle city of Manaus, including a 55-year-old Portuguese man killed while disassembling a crane that was used to install the stadium's roof earlier this year. Another worker died at the stadium of a heart attack. In 2012, a worker died at the construction site of the stadium in the nation's capital, Brasilia. Construction was already behind schedule in Sao Paulo because of the damage caused by the earlier accident in late November, when the roofing structure fell on part of the stadium's facade. Although the venue was originally planned to be finished by 'early 2014' FIFA said it was expecting the venue to be finished in mid-May, around a month before the June 12 opener. It was not clear if Saturday's incident would prompt further delays. The stadium is also known as the Conrinthians Arena - after the football club that it is home to. The stadium is located in Sao Paulo's Eastern District, one of the city's most deprived areas. The area is home to nearly four million people and the building will have a capacity of 48,000 upon completion. The contract was valued at £226 million when work began. About 20,000 temporary seats were being added to the new stadium to increase its capacity for the high-profile inaugural match between host Brazil and Croatia. In November, part of the stadium collapsed causing significant damage and killing three people. The crane was lifting a 500-tonne piece of metal during the disaster . Construction at Brazil stadiums has been plagued by delays and three venues remain unfinished less than three months before the opener. The other two stadiums under construction are the Arena Pantanal, in the city of Cuiaba, and the Arena da Baixada, in the southern city of Curitiba. Brazil promised that all 12 stadiums would be ready by the end of last year but only six were completed by the scheduled date. All of the completed stadiums were used in last year's Confederations Cup, a World Cup warm-up tournament. Infrastructure work across Brazil also remains far from completed but authorities continue to insist that the country will be ready to host its first World Cup since 1950.","Worker died at £226 million stadium which will host World Cup opener .

"A 16-year-old . Southern California girl was killed while sleeping in her bed after her . allegedly drunk neighbor crashed his SUV into her home in the pre-dawn hours Easter morning. The LA County police arrived to the gruesome scene sometime around 4am before arresting Roberto Rodriguez of Palmdale. Shocking photos show the 20-year-old's vehicle still lodged in the home at the very spot where witnesses say Giselle Mendoza moaned helplessly in the final moments of her short life. Scroll down for video... Unthinkable: 16-year-old Giselle Mendoza was run over by a car as she slept in her Southern California bedroom in the pre-dawn hours Easter Sunday after an allegedly drunk neighbor smashed his SUV through a wall . Witnesses say the SUV was going as fast as 80 miles-per-hour when it smashed into Giselle Mendoza's apartment, killing her as she slept . Suspect: The 20-year-old suspected drunk driver who killed the Southern California teen, Roberto Rodriguez, is pictured here in his Sunday mugshot. The photo reveals the Palmdale man's minor injuries. He was treated briefly and then taken into custody, where he remained until making 100,000 bail late Sunday . Earlier accounts reported that the Palmdale High School sophomore died on impact, but a more recent recounting reveals a far darker scenario. 'You would hear her moaning, kind of, inside the wall,' eyewitness James Fisher King told CBS Los Angeles. Fisher King said he watched helplessly as Rodriguez's Nissan Pathfinder careened uncontrollably toward its grim destiny. 'I saw a car coming down 10th, east, about 80-85 mph, and it didn’t stop or hesitate. Just right into the building. Boom,' Fisher King said. One account says the driver ran a red light just prior to the incident. Police say preliminary sobriety tests revealed the 20-year-old's blood alcohol content was nearly twice the legal limit. The tragedy was also gut-wrenchingly close to becoming a even more horrific. CBS LA is reporting, and Fisher King's account verifies, that the vehicle smashed violently through the bedrooms of two teen girls. 'The car came through her bedroom as well but she was sleeping, thank God, on the couch,' said Earnest Daveport of his 14-year-old daughter. Mendoza's family, including older sister Yadira Mendoza, put on their bravest faces late Sunday to tell reporters of their unimaginable grief. 'She meant everything, she was my little sister,' said Yadira Mendoza told KABC through sobs. 'What else can I say? We're just hurt. I can't believe this happened.' 'Just right into the building. Boom': Eyewitnesses said the driver careened through a red light before heading uncontrollably toward the Mendoza's apartment building . Nearly even worse: The SUV managed to fly over a curb, through a fence and through two bedrooms in separate apartments, both were those of teenaged girls. A 14-year-old cheated death when she chose to sleep on the couch Saturday night and not in her bedroom . 'I’m destroyed now...she lived here,' said the victim's inconsolable father Alberto Mendoza as he gestured toward his heart. Even through her crippling grief, the stricken big sister hoped Giselle's untimely death can send a message. 'I just want...all the people who drink and drive to stop doing it,' said told KTLA. 'It’s just causing pain for families. They are losing their family members.' 'You would hear her moaning, kind of, inside the wall,' eyewitness James Fisher King said, contradicting early reports that she'd died on impact . Mowed down: By all accounts, the blossoming beauty was a popular high school sophomore and beloved aunt to her sister's children . Before her time: The beloved daughter and sister was a high school sophomore at Palmdale High School. She was killed on impact, authorities say . NBC Los Angeles reports that roughly half the complex's units were evacuated either due to leaking fuel or because they were also damaged by the crash. L.A. County Sheriff's Sgt. David Sauer said it was possible Rodriguez was driving home and missed his turn, jumped the curb and went straight into the apartment building. 'We just heard a witness who said that he estimated the speed to be about 80 miles an hour,' he said. Rodriguez was transported to a hospital with minor injuries and booked on suspicion of vehicular manslaughter. He was released from custody on $100,000 bond late Sunday. A joyful holiday forever ruined: Giselle's older sister Yadira Mendoza wept as she spoke with reporters and pleaded for an end to drunk driving . Marred: Authorities put up cardboard to cover the hole left by Rodriguez's car. The extensive damage will undoubtedly be repaired, but the mark the freak crash has left on the Mendoza family will be there forever . Suspect: A witness got this cell phone footage of the suspected drunk driving neighbor. Rodriguez is being held in lieu of $100,000 bail .","Pictured is California high school sophomore Giselle Mendoza who was killed before dawn Sunday .

"Confession: The note that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev wrote explains the motives behind the bombings and says that he doesn't mourn his brother because he is a martyr . Dzhokhar Tsarnaev thought he was dying when he was hiding out in a boat following the Boston Marathon bombings and chose to write a note confessing his connection to the blasts and explaining why he and his brother made the two pressure cooker bombs. The 19-year-old found a pen in the boat but no paper so it was revealed today that he wrote his message on an interior wall of the boat that he used as shelter in Watertown. His message was clear: 'F*** America'. In other portions of his message, ABC News reports that he wrote 'Praise Allah' and mentioned 'infidels' across the interior walls of the boat that are now riddled with bullets. Law enforcement sources told CBS that Dzhokhar wrote that he 'does not mourn' the death of his older brother Tamerlan because he is a martyr living in 'paradise' and that he expected to join him there soon. The note is a critical piece of evidence for police as it reiterates what Dzhokhar said to them  in the hospital after his arrest. Aside from simply confirming his other statements, it could serve as back up for the eventual legal case against him because the reported confession to police came before Dzhokhar was read his Miranda rights informing him of his right to remain silent. After they were read, he reportedly stopped talking to police, but now the note will serve as a handwritten confession. Caught: Dzhokhar wrote the note on the interior wall of the boat where he hid out following the city-wide manhunt . Damage: Because police shot the boat when they were trying to catch the 19-year-old, the note was riddled with bullet holes since he wrote it on an interior wall and not a piece of paper . He wrote that the bombings were retribution for the various American crimes against Muslims in Iraq and Afghanistan. Administrators at the Boston Marathon are looking to the future, saying that any runners who were unable to complete the race this year because of the bombings have been invited to race in next year's competition free of charge. 'Boston spectators are known for their impassioned support and unbridled enthusiasm, and they will give these returning athletes some of the loudest cheers at next year's race,' the group's executive director Tom Grilk said. The symbolic move will be a costly one for the organization, as there were 5,633 runners who are eligible and will not have to submit the $110 entry fee. If every one of the invited runners come back next year, it will cost $619,630 for the marathon organizers. He equated the three people who were killed in the marathon bombings and the more than 250 others who were injured to 'collateral damage' like the thousands of innocent Muslim victims of American wars across the globe. 'When you attack one Muslim, you attack all Muslims,' he reportedly wrote. CBS reporter John Miller pointed out that the note is just the latest piece of evidence that police are using in developing their theory that the Chechen brothers worked alone and were self-radicalized rather than being the ‘soldiers’ for a larger group. Investigators are still working to determine who else- if anyone- knew about the attack before it happened. While the note is undoubtedly a boost . for the state's case against the 19-year-old suspect, who is now being . held in the medical center of an area prison, it is hardly cut and dry. Because . police fired hundreds of bullets at the boat during their attempt to . capture Dzhokhar, the note is riddled with bullet holes. He has been charged with using a weapon of mass destruction and the note will certainly be used in the case against him. Others involved: Dzhokhar wrote that he would not mourn his 'martyr' brother Tamerlan (left) though police are still trying to determine if Tamerlan's wife Katherine Russell (right, seen in in 2007) knew about the bombings . Collateral damage: In his note, Dzhokhar said that the victims of the April 15 bombing were like the innocent Muslims who had been killed in American wars abroad .","Dzhokhar Tsarnaev found a pen inside the boat he was using to hide out .

"When President Obama flew to Chicago to cast his vote early in Chicago on Thursday, he became one of over eight million Americans to have already made their decision for the November election. And now with the election just ten days away, early results from registered voters in those polls are giving both the president and Mitt Romney cause for encouragement - despite neither campaign having established a distinct advantage. President Obama appears to be matching his 2008 presidential victory totals across the country, but Romney is exceeding Senator John McCain's efforts and appears to be already ahead in key state Florida. A map of state's who have declared the results so far of early voting shows success in Florida for Romney but encouragement for Obama in North Carolina . U.S. President Barack Obama waves as he walks to Marine One for a trip to New Hampshire, today while Mitt Romney gets out of his vehicle to board his campaign plane in Akron-Canton Regional Airport, North Canton, Ohio this morning . Early voters arrive and depart from a polling station in Silver Spring, Maryland this morning . US Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney reads a document while flying from Canton, Ohio to Pensacola, Florida today . 'I think the early vote tells us the same story that we're seeing in the polls, which is that Obama's not going to win by the same margin he did in 2008,' said Michael McDonald, a professor at George Mason University who runs the United States Elections Project. 'We see it tightening.' While the most hotly contested battleground is Ohio, unfortunately election officials do not break down early voters by party. However, both Democrats and Republicans in the state are exceptionally happy with the voter turnout, which has dramatically increased from 2008. Republican presidential candidate and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney campaigns at the Pensacola Civic Center in Pensacola, Florida today . Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney greets audience members at a campaign rally in Florida today . US President Barack Obama addresses a crowd of supporters during a rally in Nashua, New Hampshire today . In Cuyahoga County in Ohio, 139,884 people have voted so far, compared with 82,764 at this time in 2008. 'Notwithstanding the voter suppression, we're doing great,' said Stuart Garson, chairman of the Democratic Party in Cuyahoga County, which includes Cleveland, which the Obama and Romney camps see as key to claiming victory on Tuesday November 6th. 'If you look at 2008 as a watershed year,' he said, 'we are actually up. We have exceeded all of those numbers so far to date, which is really just remarkable.' But with the turnout higher, Republicans believe that they will benefit from early voting this time around because of the higher profile campaign operated by Romney. 'President Obama outspent us in 2008,' said Alex M. Triantafilou, the Republican chairman of Hamilton County, which includes Cincinnati. But now 'our effort has the resources to compete … this is a different race.' 'We think the early voting program is working in our favor,' he said, calling Mitt Romney a strong candidate and 'a terrific and an organized Tea Party'. Indeed, other's believe that the . early voting results point to a strong showing in the general election . in November for a resurgent Romney. 'My . belief is let the data do the talking,' said Adrian Gray who served as . national voter contact director for the George W. Bush campaign in 2004. Gray, who is not . working on the Republican campaign this year said, 'I think in most . states that I've looked at and analyzed, I'd say that Romney is in a . pretty good position, probably looks a lot closer to 2004 than 2008.' Analysts . point to the fact that Romney has mobilised a larger portion of the . early vote than McCain and analysts have noted that Republicans are . making up a larger share of the early voters than in 2008. Starting . a two-day bus tour of Ohio's small towns and cities, Republican vice . presidential nominee Paul Ryan told voters Saturday that President . Barack Obama hasn't made the case he deserves a second term. Ryan planned stops at a factory and a . bakery, a couple of high schools and a dairy on his first day of this . campaign swing through Ohio, a state that has become the lynchpin of . Republican Mitt Romney's presidential bid. Romney . and Ryan appeared together on Friday night at a high school sports . field, and Ryan planned to be in the state alone until Monday, trying to . connect with working class voters the GOP needs if it is to deny Obama a . second term on Nov. 6. 'We cannot afford four more years . like these last four years,' Ryan told 1,000 supporters who huddled on . the cold factory floor of Gradall Industries in eastern Ohio. 'And we . don't have to.' Ryan . set out on his 400-mile tour of Ohio under gray skies and rain, . beginning a swing where he would lay the blame for the nation's . struggling economy solely at Obama's doorstep. While . Ohio has an unemployment rate lower than the national average, Ryan has . argued that the state's relative fortunes are despite Obama, not . because of him. President Obama became the first sitting president to vote early when he voted in Chicago on Thursday .

A bicycle rider pedals past President Barack Obama's headquarters in Cleveland, Cuyahoga County in Ohio . Encouraging early voter results: Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney talks to advisors in a room at the airport before a campaign rally in North Canton, Ohio yesterday . 'He can't run on his record. The Obama economic agenda failed not because it was stopped; it failed because it was passed,' Ryan said. Ryan, a congressman from Wisconsin . and the top Republican budget writer in the House, said voters need to . consider how they want to feel when they wake up the day after the . election. 'Think about . Nov. 7. Think about how you will feel the next morning when you wake up . and turn on the TV,' Ryan said. 'Are we going to have four more years . like the last four years? Are we going to wait four years before we have . real change?' Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, vice-presidential nominee Paul Ryan (left) and his wife Janna (centre) wait as they are introduced at a campaign rally in North Canton . Time, for sure, is ticking for Romney and Ryan. Polls show the race close here and both campaigns' internal polls show Romney's uptick slowing or stalled. The GOP ticket needs another boost if it is to overtake Obama, who has an advantage in the number of staffers in this state and his efforts to bank thousands of votes early. To that end, Ryan is appealing in purely parochial terms, promising a revived economy if the GOP ticket prevails. 'Thank you for making the American manufacturing sector proud,' he said in a region that once was a hub but has struggled in recent years. U.S. President Barack Obama  walks with U.S. Air Force Colonel Michael Minihan to board Air Force One to travel to a campaign event in New Hampshire, from Joint Base Andrews in Maryland today . He blamed Obama for losses in the manufacturing sector, ignoring the larger economic slowdown that had reduced demand for goods and China's rising role in that area. 'We have lost over 600,000 manufacturing jobs just in the last four years, 38,000 in just the last two months,' Ryan said. He also sought to connect personally with the local voters, comparing this Appalachian region to his hometown of Janesville, Wis. 'Where I come from is so similar to here in New Philadelphia,' he said. 'We were kind of a one-factory town.' Early voters wait in line to vote in the presidential election on the first day of early voting at a polling station setup at the City of Miami City Hall today . Then, the General Motors plant there closed and residents who counted on good-paying jobs to always be available had to take lower-paying jobs. He cited a friend who went from making $25 an hour with benefits to $9 an hour without. 'That's the story of the American economy right now,' Ryan said. 'That's the story that will end on Nov. 6 when we turn this thing around.' Ryan even employed sports to win over voters. 'We come from Big Ten country,' he said to applause before turning to the University of Wisco .","Over eight million Americans have already voted ahead of November 6th general election .

"A neurologist has been stripped of his license by the NJ State Board of Medical Examiners after allegedly sleeping with a patient. Dr. Jonathan Fellus allegedly had a sexual relationship with an unidentified woman, 33, who had suffered from a mild brain injury. She had been hurt in a car accident in February 2008 and subsequently suffered from episodes of weakness, collapse, seizure, emotional maladjustment and physical injury. Dr. Jonathan Fellus allegedly had a sexual relationship with an unidentified woman, 33, who had suffered from a mild brain injury . She was referred to Fellus by a neuropsychologist and the pair began a relationship, including sexual encounters, in 2008. The relationship ended in March 2009 when investigators say he severed contact. During their relationship, the doctor determined that she suffered a mild brain injury and some elements of post-traumatic stress disorder. 'The facts clearly show that Dr. Fellus engaged in a relationship with this patient, even though he knew . or should have known she was suffering a diagnosed cognitive disorder . and was physically debilitated by injuries she suffered in a car . accident,' Acting Attorney General John J. Hoffman told NBC Philadelphia. 'This . relationship violated long-standing ethical standards and a specific .

Besides operating Advanced NeuroCare, he operated a private practice and was chief medical officer for the International Brain Research Foundation. After three years, the doctor could be reinstated . The board said his actions “constituted gross . malpractice, professional misconduct, lack of good moral character, and . failure to comply with the Board’s rule prohibiting sexual conduct with a . patient.' 'The Board of Medical Examiners’ prohibition of sexual contact with patients is intended to protect those . who are vulnerable and who are attempting to heal,' said Division of .

"Killed: Renisha McBride was shot in the head after knocking on a door in a white suburb of Detroit as she, according to family, searched for help following a car accident . A 19-year-old Detroit woman was reportedly shot dead in the back of the head while family members say she was searching for help early Saturday in a white neighborhood outside the city. Renisha McBride was driving through Dearborn Heights, Michigan around 2:30am when she was in a car accident. At some point after knocking on the door of an area home, she was killed by the homeowner. Now her family is demanding the man responsible must pay, but police seem to belive he killed her in self defense because he thought she was a criminal. Police first said McBride’s body had . been dumped in the comparatively wealthy suburb because of its proximity . to the city. That story has changed, however, and now authorities say . she was killed near where she was found. And they’ve identified the man who shot her, though it still unclear whether he was even the one who alerted authorities. Police . won’t release his name or say whether he’s in or out of jail. A . neighbor who spoke to police on the scene said they believed it was a . self defense case. ‘He . say, somebody tried to get in his house, or seems like force,’ the . neighbor told WJBK. ‘He got scared and shot the person.’ But . McBride’s family says that cannot be true, that McBride would never . hurt anyone and simply needed help in a neighborhood that was strange to . her. And that doesn’t explain why she was shot in the back of the head. Suffering: Renisha's family, including her aunt Bernita Spinks, say she would never hurt anyone and was shot out of racism, though police reportedly told someone at the scene it was a self-defense case . Angry: 'You wanted her dead,' said Dmetria Burnett of her cousin Renisha's killer. 'For somebody to shoot her in the head and not think twice about it? He shouldn't be free at all' ‘He . did not have to pull that gun out and he did not have to kill my . niece,’ said McBride’s aunt Bernita Spinks. ‘Especially if she was . leaving off the porch.’ McBride's cousin agreed. ‘You wanted her dead,’ said Dmetria Burnett of her cousin . Renisha’s killer. ‘For somebody to shoot her in the head and not think twice . about it? He shouldn’t be free at all.’ Spinks said the man should have called 911 instead of just pulling out a firearm. ‘The police would have been pulling up in 2 or 3 minutes in Dearborn Heights,’ she said. Spinks believes her niece died because of racism and wonders what would have happened had she been the one who shot a stranger: ‘Would I be standing here? No. I’d be in jail without a bond.’ Scene: Police haven't named the shooter, but local reports put the scene of the incident--and of Renisha's final breaths--on this Dearborn Heights, Michigan suburban front porch . Police have thus far released very little information on the case, which tragically parallels a case from just a few weeks back. That’s when 24-year-old Jonathan Ferrell crashed his car in North Carolina on September 14. As he searched for help in a suburban neighborhood, he knocked on a door. The homeowner called 911 thinking that Ferrell, who was black, was trying to break into her home. When police arrived and Ferrell approached them, he was Tasered. When he continued to approach them, Charlotte Police Officer Randall Kerrick opened fire and shot him 10 times.","Renisha McBride was in a middle class white neighborhood outside Detroit when she was shot in the back of the head on a area man's porch around 2:30am Saturday .

"Questioned: Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was reportedly arrested on Monday night . Reports have claimed that the Iranian President was arrested this week and warned against releasing information which could prove damaging to the country's Islamic regime. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was allegedly held for seven hours by the Revolutionary Guard on Monday and told to back down with claims that the regime defrauded voters at the last general election and allegations of fraud against political rivals. According to WND.com, the President was returning from a book fair in Tehran when his security advisor was informed that he was requested to appear at the Supreme Leader Grand Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Hosseini Khamenei's office on an urgent matter. But three other cars are said to have joined the President's convoy and contact was lost between him and his security vehicles. Instead of being taken to the Supreme Leader's office, he was reportedly taken to a secret Foreign Ministry office where he and his security team were disarmed and stripped of communications equipment. A source told WND that Ahmadinejad was then forced to enter an office belonging to Hossein Taeb, the head of the Revolutionary Guards’ intelligence, while many of his associates across Tehran were questioned over the existence of alleged documents that would allegedly prove damaging to the country's regime. He was later released following questioning. US and British diplomats in the area are said to be aware of the reports and are viewing them 'with interest'. ‘It is potentially of considerable significance given the on-going internal political struggles as the election approaches,’ one diplomatic source said. Held: According to WND.com, the President, pictured, was returning from a book fair in Tehran when he was arrested . His alleged arrest came hours after a . regime-run news outlet reported that Ahmadinejad had threatened to . release recordings proving that voters in the 2009 Iranian elections . were defrauded and ahead of the country's general election next month. He was reported to have warned associates that if his hand-picked successor to stand for the next election in June was not approved by the country's Guardian Council, elected by the Ayatollah. It is the latest development in the deteriorating relationship between Ahmadinejad and the Supreme Leader and feuds with political rivals which are said to have seen his position shift from a traditional conservative to right wing. No love lost: The president's relationship with Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, pictured casting his vote at the 2009 general election, is said to have deteriorated . Ahmadinejad has also been involved in an ongoing power struggle with the Larijani family - a faction which holds several key seats of power in the Middle Eastern country. One of the President's allies, Saeed Mortazavi, was arrested back in February. Although no official reason was given for his arrest, it followed the disclosure of a secret film by Ahmadinejad in Parliament, in which Mr. Mortazavi could be seen discussing an apparently fraudulent business deal proposed by Fazel Larijani, 49, the youngest of the five Larijani brothers. Though President Ahmadinejad has long criticised the Larijani family for their apparent grip on power, the family say that they obtained their roles through legitimate means. Ali Larijani, 54, is the head of Parliament and former top nuclear negotiator; another, Sadegh Larijani, 52, is an ayatollah who heads Iran’s judiciary. The oldest brother, Mohammad-Javad Larijani, 61, is a Berkeley-educated mathematician, and one of the main theoreticians of the Islamic Republic’s political ideology. Ali is expected to run for President in June's elections. Iran's June 14 day at the polls is being billed as the most critical in the country's history. For the first time in more than two decades, instead of the two main faction, the election is likely to be contested from at least four. Row: President Ahmadinejad is embroiled in a political feud with the powerful Larijani faction, including head of parliament Ali Larijani, left, and Iranian judiciary chief Sadeq Larijani, right . Public opinion is said to be split ahead of the vote, with voters said to be in one of five camps; those that support the regime, those that support the current president, reformists who want full democratisation, boycotters angry at the contention surrounding the last election and floating voters. The country's last general election plunged the country into its deepest internal crisis for decades amid claims that the result was rigged to restore President Ahmadinejad to power for another term. Tapes reportedly exist proving that the President's tally was 16million and not the winning 24million that was officially announced. Millions of Iranians took to the streets in protest after the results were published demanding a re-election. Thousands were arrested and some were tortured and executed.

"Heartbroken: Danielle Deaver is fighting against the abortion law which left her no option but to give birth at 22 weeks to a baby girl who died just fifteen minutes later . Nebraska’s new abortion law forced one woman to give birth to her terminally ill, premature baby who she then helplessly held dying in her arms. Danielle Deaver gave birth to one pound, ten ounce Elizabeth last December and could do nothing but hold and comfort the baby with her husband, Robb, as the newborn struggled to breath and died fifteen agonizing minutes later. Deaver rushed to hospital when her . waters broke at only 22 weeks into the pregnancy but doctors told the couple that . their baby had almost no chance of surviving. They . explained that a lack of fluid would cause muscle tissues to shorten, . affecting the baby's developing lungs. They would likely never develop . beyond the 22-week point and the baby would not be able to breathe. With this heartbreaking information the couple decided to have an abortion to avoid the baby going through any pain. However a new law in Nebraska, the . only one of its kind in America, bars abortion at 20 weeks except in . specific situations when the mother’s life is in immediate danger. The . Deavers did not qualify and were not allowed to have an abortion. Instead they were sent home where they had to wait for ten days knowing . that when their baby arrived she had no chance of surviving. After . the days of waiting Deaver gave birth to Elizabeth and held her as she . struggled for breath and died fifteen minutes later. Now the couple, who had wanted a sibling for their son, are fighting against the law to try and prevent anyone going through the same ordeal. Agony: Banned from having an abortion the couple waited for ten agonizing days before Danielle could give birth to their baby who they already knew would not survive . The law, which took effect last October, is based on the disputed argument that a baby’s nerves are developed enough to feel pain at the 20 week stage. In a letter urging Governor Jan Brewer to veto the bill which which bans abortions after 20 weeks Danielle Deaver,34, of Grand Island, described the pain of waiting to give birth to a baby she knew would die. 'While we waited, we tried to pray, but we didn't know what to pray for.  So we spent our days and nights telling our daughter how much we loved her, how sorry we were, and how we wished we could do something different. 'There are no words for how awful the 10 days were from the moment my water broke to the day my daughter died. There are no words for the heart break that cut deeper every time she moved inside of me for those 10 days,' she wrote. Ruth Nash, 34, was pregnant with twins when her waters broke 18 weeks early. She was told her babies had a zero chance of survival and soon after lost her daughter Matilda. However, the mother from the Isle of Wight managed to delay giving birth to her son Stanley for three weeks by lying with her feet elevated in a hospital bed. Her precious son was born at just over 24weeks weighing a tiny 1lb - less than a bag of sugar. Surgeons performed several operations on Stanley including fixing a hole in his heart. Six months later, Stanley is healthy and showing no signs of his traumatic birth. The standard of viability, based on the U.S. Supreme Court’s 1973 landmark decision in Roe v. Wade, is generally considered to be between 22 and 24 weeks. 'The outcome of my pregnancy, that choice was made by God. I feel like how to handle the end of my pregnancy, that choice should have been mine, and it wasn't because of a law,' Deaver told The Register. And the couple believe that the new law doesn’t take into account individual circumstances like their own. Julie Schmit-Albin, who heads Nebraska Right to Life, believes the tragic outcome was still better than an abortion. 'We acknowledge the tragedy that occurs with a poor prenatal diagnosis for the baby. But isn't it more humane for the baby to die in a loving manner with comfort care and in the arms of her parents than by the intentional painful death through abortion?' Deaver believes that such a decision should belong to her and her husband. 'It was very frustrating and added to our grief because the waiting compounded everything,' she said.","Danielle Deaver, 34, wanted an abortion after doctors told her that her baby had no chance of surviving when her waters broke at 22 weeks .

"The actor son of the legendary star Dennis Hopper is accused of raping a 15-year-old girl after luring her to his home with promises of a 'casting couch' photo shoot. The unidentified girl is suing Henry Hopper for damages 'in the millions of dollars' for allegedly assaulting her several times after plying her with drugs and alcohol in April 2011. The teen's new lawyer, Jeff Herman, claimed to MailOnline on Monday that Hopper traded on his father's fame to convince her to go to his house after the pair met on Facebook via mutual friends. Family ties: Henry Hopper, left, is the son of late actor Dennis Hopper, right, seen together in 2008 . Mr Herman is taking over the lawsuit after it was initially filed last year and has not yet gone to trial. 'He said, ""Let's take photos of you"" and he used the to entice her to see him,' Mr Herman alleged to MailOnline. Mr Herman claimed the then-20-year-old Hopper promised to snap modeling pictures of her and to use his fame to help her. The girl, now 17 years old, met Hopper on Facebook via mutual friends in 2011. Mr Herman said it's a classic . 'casting couch' scam that is used all over Hollywood to lure . unsuspecting girls and young women into sex. Henry Hopper's agent refused to comment about any of the allegations facing the actor when asked by MailOnline. Up and coming: Henry is seen in 2011 with his costar Mia Wasikowska for the film 'Restless' After meeting online, the lawsuit . alleges, the two began messaging back and forth in spite of the fact . that he was five years older than she was. Mr Herman says that after communicating electronically, . they eventually agreed to meet at Hopper's house. He paid for a cab to . pick the girl up and drive her to his home in April 2011. When she arrived, he gave her unspecified 'non-narcotic' drugs and alcohol, and that is when the sexual assault occurred. 'Over . about the next 10 months, there were more incidents in which Hopper . again had Jane Doe brought to his house, furnished her with drugs and . alcohol, and then raped her,' the lawyer said in a press release. 'These . encounters were initiated through sexual Facebook messages from Hopper . to Jane Doe. These sexual messages included, among other things, a . request that Jane Doe send him photos of her so she can “pleasure him . from afar”; and being into a “school girl vibe” when “doin the nasty” with Jane Doe.' Mr Herman said his client reported . the allegation to police, but that the investigation remains open and . Hopper was never charged with a crime. Claims: The girl says that she was 15-years-old when a then-20-year old Henry repeatedly raped her (Henry seen here with his father in 2009) The teen says her life 'fell apart' after the attack. She lost her friends and had to be hospitalized . several times for mental health issues. Despite this, Mr Herman says, she went back to Hopper's house several times and maintained a sexual relationship with him. 'He continues to contact her and for a while, she had nothing - this was the only thing she had,' he said. Mr Herman said she was a 'compliant . victim' at that point - but maintains Hopper was taking advantage of her . fragile mental state. The teen's mental and emotional problems continue to this day, he added. Henry Hopper is an actor who appeared in 'Tree of Life' and Gus Van Sant's 'Restless,' both in 2011. His father Dennis died at the age of 74 in 2010, following a battle with prostate cancer. He was known for cult classics such as Easy Rider, Apocalypse Now and Blue Velvet. Henry's mother, Katherine LaNasa, was the fourth wife of Dennis Hopper.","A lawsuit alleges Henry Hopper 'raped the 15-year-old after plying her with drugs and alcohol'

"A New Zealand tourist who planned to spend a few days exploring an island in his canoe was left trapped and desperate on a hill for two weeks after being stalked by a monster crocodile. The unfortunate traveller had set up camp on remote Governor Island, off the coast of Western Australia, intending to paddle his canoe around the island but the arrival of the 20ft-long crocodile changed all that. Instead, he remained terrified at his campsite, which he had hurriedly set up on a hill on the 250-acre island in the hope that he was too far inland for the crocodile to reach him. Terrifying a tourist: A New Zealand traveller was trapped on remote Governor Island off the West Australian coast for two weeks after he was stalked by a 20ft-long crocodile (file photo) And it was only by chance that rescue came, when a light he flashed to attract attention resulted in him getting a lift in a boat to safety. The tourist, known only as Ryan, owes his survival to local man Don McLeod, who decided to check out the light and found the distraught man 'relieved and shocked.' Mr McLeod said today that 'every time he got in his little kayak, which was only about 2.5m (8ft) long, this crocodile, which has lived there for many years, chased him. 'He was desperate for water when I trotted up.' Chance rescue: Local man Don McLeod saw the tourist's light flashing from the island and rescued him by boat from the giant reptile (file photo) Mr McLeod said the crocodile was . 'easily 20ft long', a measurement he said was accurate because that is . the length of his boat and he has sailed past the reptile from time to . time. A yachtsman had . dropped Ryan off at the island, off the north-west coast near Kalumburu, . which lies between Derby and Kununurra, and it was there that the . tourist had decided to use his canoe to explore the inlets. After setting up a tent he realised he did not have enough supplies and decided to paddle the three miles back to the mainland. But as he launched his small canoe he saw the crocodile watching him - and made good his escape back to his camp site, which he then moved to higher ground. According to Mr McLeod, each time the Kiwi tourist tried to leave the island the crocodile 'made its presence felt, and so the fellow was left stranded there for an entire fortnight.' It was only when Mr McLeod spotted a light on the island and decided to check it out, that he courageously set foot there. 'I'd seen a light flashing in the scrub as I came through Red Bluff, opposite Governor Island, and decided to have a look what it was. 'When I arrived Ryan came out of the bush looking distraught. He had no hat on and no shirt on. 'He was relieved and shocked and thankful someone had come along because he was running out of options pretty quickly. 'He is a very, very lucky man.' Ryan was given a bed at a church mission on the mainland but his whereabouts today were unknown.

"Far-right politician Marine Le Pen has fractured her spine after falling into an empty swimming pool in France, it emerged tonight. News of the 44-year-old's 'rather serious' accident will send shockwaves around nationalist groups, not just in France but across Europe. Le Pen, who is leader of the National Front (FN), is one of the most high-profile right-wing politicians on the continent, with her hardline anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim agenda regularly winning a huge number of votes at elections. Family politics: Marine Le Pen, with her father Jean-Marie Le Pen, who she succeeded as leader of the Front National . A poll in May showed that the current president, Francois Hollande, would lose to her if France were to vote tomorrow. Miss Le Pen has been capitalising recently on growing discontent in over economic gloom, record unemployment levels and President Hollande's personal unpopularity. News of her accident was broken by her notorious father, the convicted racist and anti-Semite Jean Marie Le Pen, who was runner-up in the French presidential elections of 2002. Explaining his daughter's absence from an FN meeting in Limoges today, Le Pen senior said: 'Marine could not come because she was the victim of a rather serious accident that prevented her from moving. She fell into an empty pool and got a fracture of the spine.' A statement released by the FN said Le Pen had a fracture of the sacral - the triangle-shaped bone at the bottom of the spine. It is a particularly painful condition which severely limits movement and may require surgery to put right. Le Pen's accident happened a week ago but, said the FN, she was determined it would not stop her fulfilling future engagements. Modernising influence: Marine Le Pen is a pivotal force in French politics after moving her party's image away from extremism and racism . The FN, which was founded by her father, is the third largest political force in France, and has been led by Le Pen since January 2011. Since then she has attempted to modernise its image for extremism, and for intimidating Jews, Muslims, and those from racial minorities. In recent weeks she has been at the forefront of the campaign to prevent gay marriage in France, and has also been a fierce critic of Francois Hollande's Socialist government. She wants to severely reduce immigration to France, reinstate capital punishment, and withdraw from the European Union. Like her father, Le Pen's energy and enthusiasm has come to personify the FN - something which could now be put at risk by her accident.","Marine Le Pen is leader of France's far-right Front National party .

"Google has changed the tagline on its Palestinian home page from 'Palestinian territories' to 'Palestine', suggesting its now recognises the disputed region as an independent state. The move follows the UN decision in November 2012 to upgrade Palestine's status from an 'entity', to a 'non-member observer state'. As a result anyone logging on to www.google.ps will now see 'Palestine' in Arabic displayed under the main Google logo. New look: Google has changed the tagline on its Palestinian home page from 'Palestinian territories' to 'Palestine' The old homepage with the tagline 'Palestinian territories' Google spokesman Nathan Tyler, said: 'We’re changing the name ‘Palestinian Territories’ to ‘Palestine’ across our products. 'We consult a number of sources and authorities when naming countries. In this case, we are following the lead of the UN, ICANN, ISO and other international organisations.' Although the move to upgrade Palestine to a nonmember observer state has changed little on the ground, it carried deep potential significance. The vote amounted to an international . endorsement of the Palestinian position on future border arrangements . with Israel and an overwhelming condemnation of Israeli settlements in . the areas claimed by the Palestinians. Delight: Palestinians celebrate the UN decision to upgrade their status from 'entity' to 'non-member observer state' in November last year . Israel also continues to restrict access to Gaza. Israel withdrew seven years ago from the coastal strip, and it is now ruled by Hamas Islamic militants who regularly fire rockets at Israel. Israel, backed by the U.S., campaigned strongly against the statehood measure, accusing the Palestinians of trying to bypass direct peace negotiations, which it said were the only viable path to a Palestinian state. The Israeli lobbying efforts failed miserably. Just eight other countries voted with Israel, and even its closest allies in Europe, including Germany, Italy, France and Britain, either abstained or voted with the Palestinians. The phrase 'Palestinian territories' is used to describe the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) and the Gaza Strip. The UN, the EU, the Red Cross and the British government have all used the term 'Occupied Palestinian Territories'. Many Israeli's strongly object to because they claim it effectively disregards Israels claims to the region. There is some confusion due to the use of the phrase 'Israeli-occupied territories' which, as well as the West Bank and the Gaza Strip also includes the Golan Heights which once formed part of Syria. The three areas were occupied by Israel after the six days war in 1967.",Follows UN decision to upgrade Palestine's status from 'entity' to 'non-member observer state'
"An adult film actress booked for a job at a gated Malibu estate believes showbiz CEO Richard Nanula was a co-star she worked with, who asked to be called 'Mr Rich'. Sarah Shevon said her agent arranged the $300 sex scene, in which the actress was dressed in a schoolgirl-style skirt and white blouse knotted at her midriff, in April last year. She said when a website published pornographic pictures allegedly showing Mr Nanula in June, she recognized the man as 'Mr Rich', according to the Los Angeles Times. Allegations: Sarah Shevon has claimed that she filmed an adult movie with Richard Nanula . Mr Nanula reportedly resigned in the wake of . pornographic photos of him emerging online and a work-related sexual . harassment suit despite a sex-addicition rehab stint ten years previously. The Harvard MBA held top titles at Disney, biotech . juggernaut Amgen, and chairman of the board of . Miramax. Shevon now believes the job she was booked for was what is known in the industry as a 'private' - an encounter between a porn star and a paying customer - and that it was filmed so it would not be seen as a criminal act of . prostitution. She told the Los Angeles Times she never saw the finished video, and did not know . whether it was posted on the website it was allegedly for. 'I don't like how there are these guys who have a lot of money and power . and they feel like they can just take advantage of girls or get . whatever they want out of them by throwing money at them,' she said. The 29-year-old said her co-star was a well dressed man who filmed the scene as well as taking part in it. She added that it was clear he was not a porn pro. Maxed out: Miramax chairman Richard Nanula has taken a leave of absence after a sexual harassment charge and after photos of him in a compromising position with a porn star allegedly hit the internet . She added that fellow actress Trinity St Clair had asked her to perform a private in a Malibu home two years ago, where she would be expected to perform oral sex, for $1,500. Shevon told the Los Angeles Times she declined the offer because 'it was prostitution'. However, last year, her agent Mark Spiegler approached her with another offer in Malibu, allegedly for a film on Ms St Clair's website. Ms St Clair has declined to comment repeatedly, through her publicist, James Bartholet, according to a news agency. Dan Miller, executive managing editor of a porn industry trade magazine, told the Los Angeles Times that taping the encounter might have been seen as a way to avoid breaking the law. 'The thinking would seem to be, ""OK, there is a camera there, it's a shoot"",' he said. Suspicious: Sarah Shevon believes she was booked for a 'private' job . Mr Spiegler claimed that after Shevon's scene, Ms St Clair booked two more of his clients for night shoots in Malibu with an actor allegedly identified as Richard. Because he did not know the actor, and said porn films are not typically shot at night, Mr Spiegler asked to meet 'Richard'. He told the Los Angeles Times he believes the man he met in June 2012 was Mr Nanula, adding: 'He didn't seem like a professional porn person.' After meeting the alleged actor, Mr Spiegler cancelled the shoot, adding that the man's medical tests, which he reviewed, had come from a private doctor rather than the usual clinics porn actors go to. Thomas J. Barrack Jr, the billionaire founder of Colony who is now chairman of Miramax, declined to discuss Mr Nanula's resignation. 'This is a personal matter for Richard and unrelated to Miramax,' he said in July. 'Richard did an excellent job at managing his business duties.' Variety had reported on June 26 that website TheDirty.com had published photos it claimed showed Nanula engaged in sex acts with a porn star. Sources for Variety said the photos were the reason for the leave of absence Nanula recently took from Miramax and Colony Capital, which owns a large stake in the entertainment group. One of Colony Capital’s largest investors, it should be noted, is Qatar Holding, the sovereign wealth fund of a conservative Muslim country. ‘Richard Nanula has taken a leave of absence from Colony and Miramax for personal reasons,’ Lisa Baker, a publicist with Owen Blicksilver PR, which reps Colony, told Variety. Now, the New York Post is reporting that a sexual harassment suit may be an additional reason for Nanula’s leave of absence. Additionally, says the Post, that leave of absence is actually a permanent vacation. However, Colony Capital failed to substantiate the Post’s tip that Nanula has resigned. Cured? Nanula, 2nd from right in 1997, reportedly entered a 6-day sex addiction rehab ten years ago that, he claimed in his divorce, had cured him . ‘Based on our investigation,’ a Colony rep told Page Six, ‘these matters are personal to Mr. Nanula, and it would not be appropriate to comment further at this time.’ The harassment suit centers on a paralegal at Colony named Stephanie Shaw, who claims Nanula groped her buttocks in an ‘unwelcome, extreme, and offensive’ way back in early 2012 and filed suit in a Los Angeles court. Shaw, who was fired after less than a year with the company, is also alleging wrongful termination, among other wrongdoings. The court documents can be read in their entirety, here. Accused: A paralegal at Colony Capital, which has a major stake in Miramax, has filed a sexual harassment suit against Nanula claiming he groped her buttocks and that she was subsequently fired . Meanwhile, this isn’t the first bit of funny business the executive has been accused of. Back in 2005, Nanula’s then-wife Tracey filed for divorce. According to court papers, Tracey claimed she had found that Nanula had spent as much as $10,000 on prostitutes and traced his infidelities back to 2001. Tracey also indicated in her filing that Nanula had, at one time, completed a six-day rehab stint for sex addiction that he subsequently claimed had cured him. Tracey Nanula would not comment on the case. The sexual harassment issue is now in binding arbitration, in which Shaw is seeking unspecified damages. MailOnline had reached out to Miramax and Colony Capital, though neither had responded at the time of publication. Stepped down?

"Before she fell in love with a 10-year-old boy pupil, tattooed his name on her chest and made him she had cast a spell on him, primary school teacher, Diane Brimble, had once been described as a selfless ‘supermum’. Brimble, a mother of eight who lured the boy to her rose-covered home in country Victoria for sex, is expected to escape prison when she is sentenced on Thursday for what her victim’s parents describe as ‘evil’ acts upon their son. Just two years after graduating from university to take her ‘dream come true’ job teaching primary schoolkids, 47-year-old Brimble was exposing her breasts to the boy, asking him for sex and showing him condoms and sex toys. The mother of children aged nine to 27 years and believer in spells and magic had a framed photo of the boy on his bedside table and designed a tattoo with the words ‘love for’ and his name in an infinity symbol. Hamilton mother-of-eight Diane Brimble attempted to have sex with a 10-year-old male student in her house, and had photos of him on her phone, the Victorian County Court heard on Monday. Brimble faced court charged with five counts of committing an indecent act with a child aged under 16 years, and one charge of using a telecommunications device to groom a child. She pleaded not guilty to all six charges. Brimble so influenced the boy, his parents said that he believed she could control his thoughts and he ended up so traumatised he had to be medicated. During a trial at Warrnambool County Court – just minutes from the university campus where she had so proudly graduated in 2011 – Brimble was described as exhibiting ‘bizarre’conduct and a baffling’ psycho sexual profile’. Crown prosecutor Patrick Bourke told the court the boy victim had described physical contact with Brimble as ‘weird’ or ‘bad’. Mr Bourke said Brimble told the boy she loved him, called him her boyfriend, said she wanted to sleep with him, offered him vodka and opened a suitcase and showed him sex toys, truth-or-dare cards and a pregnancy test. He said Brimble had feelings for or an infatuation for the boy and wrote poetry, letters and sent him Facebook messages. She had a photo of him in her locket, 20 photos of him on her mobile phone, one of which as the phone’s screen saver. She also wanted to be buried with a photo of him and a pipe cleaner ring he had given her. Police say Brimble hugged him all over and kissed him, and when he said he wasn’t old enough to have sex she said, ‘you are when you’re at my house’. Mr Bourke said that when the boy moved to a different school, Brimble tried to enrol some of her own children at his new school. A jury took two days to find her not guilty of the child grooming charge and four other charges, but convicted her of committing an indecent act which involved hugging and kissing the boy while asking him to have sex. In the court, the boy’s mother made a victim impact statement, saying Brimble she was disgusted when she heard about the chest tattoo with her boy’s name on it and that Brimble had ‘stolen his innocence’. She said the boy had self-harmed as a result of ‘a hell Brimble’s predatory actions thrust upon him’. ‘I feel sickened – as a mother – that she did this under the guise of motherly love.’ ‘The commemorative tattoo etched into her body of my child’s name in the symbol of infinity, couple with her belief in spells and spirits makes me convinced that she truly believes she is meant to be united in dreams for eternity,’ the mother said. She described how while the boy’s siblings drew pictures of rainbows and unicorns, her son had started drawing knives and scenes featuring death. In a victim impact statement read out in court, the boy’s father said his son’s trust had been destroyed, the family had had to move and his son had to repeat his education because of Brimble’s predatory behaviour. He said his son, who has Asperger’s syndrome, said Brimble was on him’. ‘She tried to manipulate [him] to make him think she loved him and his parents did not,’ the statement read out by prosecutor Patrick Bourke said. ‘I feel sick every time I think of my son’s name tattooed on her body.’ Judge Mark Taft said Brimble had driven the boy to her house where she offered him sex, but he had rejected his advances. ‘I find Ms Brimble’s conduct as bizarre as any I have seen in a courtroom, ‘ he said. Barrister Jennifer Clark, on behalf of Brimble, said her client had developed an affection beyond the normal teacher/student relationship, ‘but she has not overstepped into criminal conduct’. Ms Clark said Brimble had endured a difficult life and an abusive marriage which she had fought hard to overcome by becoming a teacher. In 2011, following her graduation from Deakin University, Brimble told the Warrnambool Standard that she had fought hard to gain her degree, attending classes while her youngest child was still a toddler and making a two-hour return commute up to four times a week. She had achieved her dream of completing tertiary education after finishing her high school certificate as a mature age student by correspondence over two years. Described as a ‘supermum’, who had sat exam at the same time as her two eldest children, Brimble said she had completed her studies with the support of friends and university lecturers. ‘It was a bit tiring but it was all worth it,’ she said. ‘I guess I always wanted to be a teacher and finally set out to achieve that.’ The Victorian Institute of Teaching, which has already suspended Brimble from teaching, is expected to strip her of her right to teach and disqualify her for life. Brimble, who will be sentenced in the Victorian County Court in Melbourne at 10am on Thursday, will likely never teach again. Brimble has been assessed for a community corrections order and has undergone a psychological report.","Mother-of-eight Diane Brimble tried to have sex with 10-year-old student in her house .

"What started as a peaceful protest against the Albuquerque Police Department quickly turned violent by nightfall with officers in riot gear breaking out the tear gas. At least 500 people gathered on the steps of the Albuquerque Police department on Sunday to condemn the recent police killing of 38-year-old James Boyd. Earlier this week hacktivist group Anonymous posted a video online calling for locals to occupy police headquarters and take a stand against Boyd's 'cold blooded' murder. 'Let them know that your city is not a place for war games against the homeless and the less fortunate,' the group said in the video. While there were no reports of injuries or arrests in the early hours of the protest, things took a turn as night fell with police using tear gas on the group and making arrests. Scroll down for video . What started as a peaceful protest against the Albuquerque Police Department quickly turned violent by nightfall with officers in riot gear breaking out the tear gas . Police in riot gear used tear gas on a group of protesters gathered to condemn the recent killing of a homeless man by two officers . APD officers started making arrests too as the protest went into its tenth hour . 'We want justice!': Hundreds gathered in downtown Albuquerque Sunday to protest the recent police killing of homeless man James Boyd, 38 . Calm: The 300 protesters were met by police in riot gear, but the demonstration remained peaceful with no reported arrests . Marching: The protest started out at police headquarters before heading to Civic Plaza and the University of New Mexico campus . Confrontation: A woman yells at a police officer in riot gear during the protests on Sunday . The protest started around noon today, with hundreds gathering outside of police headquarters in downtown Albuquerque. Justified? James Boyd was killed March 16 after a stand-off with police in the Albuquerque foothills where he was camped out . 'Hey hey! Ho ho! Killer cops have got to go!' the protesters, wearing Guy Fawkes' masks, chanted. The masks have become a rallying symbol for Anonymous, which also seems to have hacked into the APD website today - causing it to shutdown from morning until at least 4:30pm. A Twitter account claiming to be connected to the organization tweeted a list of APD officers phone numbers.A police spokesman could not confirm whether the numbers were authentic. While police showed up with batons and riot gear, the demonstration remained peaceful with protesters marching between APD headquarters, Civic Plaza and the University of New Mexico campus for several hours. Police even shut down a street to make sure none of the protesters were injured in traffic. But things took a turn about eight hours into the protest when the demonstrators started vandalizing property, with one person trying to take down a street sign, others spray-painting property and a group trying to push over a police cruiser. When the protest returned to APD headquarters officers warned the crowd to clear the area since it was an unlawful protest. But the protesters said they wouldn't stop until the police chief is fired, prompting police to release at least a dozen tear gas canisters on the group gathered on Central Ave around 9:30pm. There were reports of several people being arrested and taken away in police cruisers. At least one police officer was injured in the protest, and another was isolated in his car while a group of protesters tried to break the windows. Locals are being told to avoid the area while residents at the University of New Mexico are sheltering in their dorms. State Senator Joseph Cervantes tweeted that his daughter was in one of the UNM dorms impacted by the tear gas. 'We respected their rights to protest obviously,' Mayor Richard Berry said, 'but what it appears we have at this time is individuals who weren’t connected necessarily with the original protest … they’ve taken it far beyond a normal protest.' The protesters were marching in . response to the March 16 police killing of Boyd, 38, who was found . camped out in the hills surrounding Albuquerque. Lapel . camera footage released by the APD shows half a dozen officers standing . 20 feet away from the man shouting 'get on the ground' and 'drop the . knife!' before shooting unloaded beanbags, stun guns and live rounds on . him. Boyd, who police say had a lengthy criminal record, later died. Curtained off: The protest led police to shut down one street for safety . Police in riot gear great protesters at a major thoroughfare . Their message: Protesters hold up signs reading 'I'm mad' and 'APD Brutality Ends Now' on the steps of police headquarters . Face to face: Police officers holding batons meet a group of seated protesters on an Albuquerque street . Lined up: Police officers hold their places during the protests on Sunday . Shooters: APD Officers Keith Sandy (left) and Dominique Perez (right) were placed on leave following Boyd's killing . Officers Keith Sandy and Dominique Perez have been placed on leave since the incident. But Albuquerque Police Chief Gorden Eden said in a press conference that he thought his officers' actions were justified. ‘The officers were attempting to affect a felony arrest using less-than lethal weapons, including a distractive device, K9, and a Taser shotgun,’ Eden said. Authorities said Boyd threatened to kill a Crisis Intervention Team officer called to the scene. When Boyd refused to follow police orders and an unarmed K9 officer got close to him, officers Keith Sandy and Dominique Perez shot toward Boyd, Eden said. The video footage shows an injured Boyd with two five-inch knives in his hand when officers surround and handcuff him. Police in Albuquerque are facing intense criticism after video footage was released which appears to show officers using excessive force to apprehend James Boyd, a homeless man who was holding two knives . Two police officers each fired three bullets causing Boyd to fall to the ground. A medical examiner has not yet determined if the bullets killed Boyd . The video footage shows an injured Boyd with two five-inch knives in his hand when officers surround and handcuff him . ‘The suspect did in fact make a decision not to follow the directions that (were) provided to him by the officers,’ Eden said. ‘On many occasions he said that he was not going to come off that mountain.’ However, Boyd's death is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to police killings in the New Mexico capital. The U.S. Justice Department has been investigating the Albuquerque police for a year, following reports of  more than three dozen police shootings since 2010. ‘We need to look at some changes within the department, but I think more importantly we need to restore confidence in the Albuquerque police department,’ said City Council President Ken Sanchez. State Senator Michael Padilla said he was responding to worried constituents. He says he was disturbed not only by the video, but by APD Police Chief Gorden Eden’s comments that the shooting was justified. ‘I'm very concerned about the chief of police immediately jumping to conclusions,’ Padilla said. ‘I think we all know with camera on the lapel video - something definitely happened.’ Sanchez said he was concerned about how the public now sees the APD. ‘We need to work hard to restore confidence in the men and women who work for the Albuquerque Police Department,’ he told KOB4.","Hactivist group Anonymous called on locals to protest homeless man James Boyd's killing .

With footballer Rio Ferdinand and a number of soap stars in attendance, it was at a glitzy celebrity party in Central London that Dynamo appeared to walk through a pane of glass. The magician handed his jacked to two bouncers who then held it up to create a shoulder-high screen. He then disappeared behind the screen before re-emerging on the pavement on the other side of the shop window, as if he had made his way through the glass, much to the bemusement of the onlookers.

Appearing on This Morning in the summer of 2012, Dynamo showed presenters Holly Willoughby and Philip Schofield how he had won £10,000 by predicting exactly how Spain would win Euro 2012 from the quarter finals onwards. Holding up a betting slip as proof of the 10,000-1 gambit the illusionist had even forecast how Spain would win by two or more goals against their Italian rivals. The magician told how he made a £1 accumulator bet just before the quarter-finals on June 21.

"David Cameron has piled the pressure on the growing crisis in Tony Blair’s reputation by calling for an end to hold-ups in a long-delayed report on the Iraq War. The former Prime Minister has been accused of trying to delay publication of the Chilcot Inquiry over well-sourced reports that it will  savage his handling of the conflict. Now Mr Cameron has stepped into the dispute by making it clear Sir John Chilcot’s findings should be made public as soon as possible. Tony Blair, pictured answering questions in 2010, has been accused of trying to delay publication of the Chilcot Inquiry . It follows claims that Mr Blair and Labour hope to delay the report until after next year’s General Election, arguing any criticism of the last Labour Government could hit Ed Miliband’s hopes of success. ‘The PM believes there is no excuse for any further lengthy delay in publishing Chilcot,’ said a No 10 aide. ‘It would be unreasonable to postpone it beyond the next Election.’ The controversy comes as Mr Blair faces an increasing struggle to retain his standing. The Mail on Sunday’s disclosure of his weekends with Rupert Murdoch’s wife Wendi Deng – and the role it played in the Murdochs’ divorce – damaged his personal image. His reputation as a statesman and businessman has also come under heavy fire. A recent speech, during which he urged Britain to set aside its differences with Russia to fight radical Islam, was dismissed as ‘embarrassingly simple-minded’ by some experts. It led to some questioning how long he can continue as the West’s envoy to the Middle East. And an attack on Mr Blair by his biographer Philip Stephens, published on Friday by the Financial Times, claimed he had built up a £100 million fortune since leaving Downing Street in 2007 in his ‘lust for personal riches and attention’. One of the main bones of contention over the report into the conflict (pictured) is private notes between Blair and the then US President George W. Bush . Friends of Mr Blair fear that with his overall reputation in the balance, public condemnation by Chilcot will be the last straw. A former Labour ally said: ‘Since leaving Downing Street, Tony has managed to remain a big player on the world stage and use it to earn money, justifying it by doing good work at the same time. ‘It has served him well, but it is  all starting to collapse. If Chilcot points the finger of blame squarely at him, which Blair himself knows full well it will, the whole edifice could crumble. That is why it is in his interest that Chilcot should be delayed for as long as possible.’ Mr Blair has dismissed the inquiry, saying ‘going back’ over events will not help Britain solve the Middle East crisis, but he denies blocking it. One of the main bones of contention is private notes between him and the then US President George W. Bush, which show the decision to go to war was taken long before Mr Blair indicated the measure publicly. Concerns: Friends of Mr Blair fear that with his overall reputation in the balance, public condemnation by Chilcot will be the last straw . Chilcot wants to publish the notes and told Mr Cameron last year that it was ‘regrettable’ this had not been agreed. Mr Cameron said he hoped for a resolution ‘as soon as possible’. Mr Blair’s camp is resisting, arguing it would compromise future prime ministers and presidents. There are claims that former barrister Mr Blair and his advisers are challenging every detail raised by Chilcot and his panel of experts. Mr Cameron can expect little support from the current Labour leader in bringing forward Chilcot. Even though Ed Miliband has disowned the Iraq War, strategists fear it will remind voters of the last Labour Government’s record on Iraq and cost them votes.","Former PM accused of trying to delay publication of Chilcot Inquiry .

"Children as young as eight are among dozens of youngsters who have been arrested on suspicion of rape in the past five years - prompting fears that easy access to hard-corn porn is to blame. Police in Greater Manchester have detained a total of 215 children aged 15 or younger on rape allegations since 2009, new figures reveal. Most of those arrested were boys, apart from three girls under the age of 15 who were also arrested for rape-related crimes in the same period.

Most of those arrested were boys, but three girls under the age of 15 were also arrested (file picture) A leading children's charity has expressed horror at the findings, suggesting easy access to hard-core pornography and the rise of 'sexting' is now shaping children's views about sexual behaviour. Jon Brown, head of the sex abuse unit at NSPCC, said: ‘It's deeply concerning that such a lot of children are committing sexual offences, including serious assaults and rape. ‘For very young children, such as those of primary school age, we have to explore and understand the environment in which they are growing up in that has led to them behaving in this way. ‘It could be that they have seen sexual activity that they are just too young to understand and are copying what they've seen.’ The figures from Greater Manchester Police (above) show that less than 20 per cent of those arrested were charged, while 10 children escaped with just a final warning - the equivalent of a caution when prosecution is not deemed to be in the public interest . Mr Brown said that increasing exposure to hard-core, degrading and often violent pornography could be 'warping' youngsters' ideas of what is acceptable behaviour. Number of children detained for rape in Greater Manchester between 01/01/2009 and 31/12/2013: . 15 Years of age = 51 . 14 Years of age = 81 . 13 Years of age = 48 . 12 Years of age = 20 . 11 Years of age = 11 . 10 Years of age = 2 . 9 Years of age = 1 . 8 Years of age = 1 . Charged: 41 . Final warning:  10 . ‘It is also feeding into “sexting” where teenagers are creating and distributing their own videos and images that are illegal and have led to prison sentences,’ he said. The figures from Greater Manchester Police show that less than 20 per cent of those arrested were charged, while 10 children escaped with just a final warning - the equivalent of a caution when prosecution is not deemed to be in the public interest. Detective Superintendent Jon Chadwick said special procedures were in place to deal with young alleged offenders. But he added that all reports of rape were taken seriously by officers regardless of the age of the suspect or offender. He said: ‘Rape is a very serious offence and therefore we thoroughly investigate every report. ‘At the heart of all investigations is protecting the welfare of the victims.’","Police in Greater Manchester have detained a total of 215 children since 2009 .

"There's nothing like the cry of 'Come on me lovelies! Apples 'n' pears! Ten for a paand!' to liven up a market. But in Scunthorpe the bureaucrats like things a little less clamorous. Council officials have caused fury by banning stallholders from pitching their goods. Greengrocer Simon Stanley, left, who has been banned from the market and slapped with a £1,000 legal fee after pitching his wares to punters and right, his wife Trudi Stanley, who has been left to run the business alone . Barmy: Traders at Scunthorpe Market, pictured, have been banned from yelling out their prices over 'elf and safety fears they could damage people's hearing . Ever since trading began, sellers have . shouted out their prices to attract customers. But strict rules on . 'calling off' detailed in a council traders' charter have led to a . greengrocer being taken to court, banned from his market for three . months and hit with a £980 legal bill. Simon Stanley's offence was to shout out his prices at his indoor market stall. Several butchers have also been given . written warnings for verbally hawking their wares and the 70 traders at . Scunthorpe Market are refusing to recognise the  controversial . 'charter' – which even has a section on what 'banter' is allowed. The rules – imposed without any . discussion – state stallholders can only 'call off' after 1pm on . Saturday. The market is open six days a week and for the rest of the . time all shouting is banned. New rules imposed in a so-called Traders' Charter prevent 70 traders flogging their wares in the market - a rule that traders warn could impact heavily on their sales . The only reason given for the baffling clampdown is to 'prevent annoyance to other traders'. Mr Stanley, 45, who has been running . his greengrocer's stall with wife Trudi, 39, for three years, was . monitored by council investigators who detailed 16 incidents of him . breaking the rules by 'calling off'. The father of four was taken to county . court three weeks ago and a three-month injunction was imposed, banning . him from the market until December 12. He said: 'It's lunacy. I have been . shouting for three years here and never had a  single complaint from a . member of the public. Shouting out the prices of our goods is part of . the atmosphere of a market.' Julia Murray, 47, from the Scunthorpe . Traders Association, said all the traders had been given the 'charter' to sign and no one had done so. She said most in the food hall depended on pitching to sell perishable goods near the end of their shelf life. North Lincolnshire Council said it could not comment on cases involving individual traders. A spokesman added: 'Calling off and . pitching is part of market life and is permitted as long as it follows . guidelines set out in the charter.'","New rules prevent 70 traders flogging their wares nearly every day .

"Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich's partner has sparked an internet firestorm after an online magazine published a photo of her sitting on a chair made to resemble a half-naked black woman - on Martin Luther King Day. Buro 24/7 used the horrendously offensive image of Dasha Zhukova Monday to illustrate an unrelated interview about the former model's new magazine, Garage. Miroslava Duma, the blog's editor, also posted the insensitive photo on Instagram. Both were met with an immediate barrage of disgusted comments, and Duma quickly deleted the picture from Instagram and cropped out the chair on Buro 24/7. Outrage: Buro 247 used the horrendously offensive image, pictured, of Dasha Zhukova Monday to illustrate an unrelated interview about the former model's new magazine, Garage . 'This is incredibly racist,' Organizing for Women's Liberation tweeted Monday, after news of the unbelievable picture spread. In the image, the Moscow-born 32-year-old, wearing a crisp white shirt buttoned nearly to the top and blue jeans, perches on an extremely life-like black mannequin who is naked save for a pair of leather-look black panties, a dominatrix-style belt, elbow length gloves and knee-high boots. The dummy is laying on her back with her knees bent and a cushion, which Zhukova is sitting on, is balanced on her bottom. Her neck is propped up off the floor uncomfortably, as if she is straining to look at her master, and her amble, naked bosom is pressed provocatively against her body. Zhukova, staring at the camera, appears the complete opposite of the black woman she's weighing down. Zhukova's publicist blasted the use of the image on MLK day and said her client has a strong record of promoting diversity. She said it was 'regrettable' that the image of the chair by Norwegian artist Bjarne Melgaard had been used on such a sensitive day by the blog, and pointed out that such a use took the work completely out of context. Zhukova herself added: 'This photograph, which has been published completely out of context, is of an art work intended specifically as a commentary on gender and racial politics. I utterly abhor racism, and would like to apologise to anyone who has been offended by this image.' Wealthy: Zhukova, right, is the wife of Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich, left . Cropped version: After an immediate barrage of disgusted comments, Duma deleted the picture from Instagram and cropped out the chair on Buro 24/7, pictured . The website also responded Tuesday after the controversy. 'Buro 24/7 is against racism and everything that may humiliate people,' a spokesman said in a statement. 'The chair presented on a photo should be seen like nothing but a piece of contemporary art. We sincerely apologize if the posted photos insulted our readers. FashionBombDaily.com editor Claire Sulmers was among the first to express her disbelief, claiming the photo's message was startlingly clear: 'White dominance and superiority, articulated in a seemingly serene yet overtly degrading way.' She wrote on her blog that racism remained rampant in the art and fashion worlds and this needed to stop. Editor: Dasha Zhukova is the editor-in-chief of Garage magazine, pictured, which focused on art and fashion. She is also described as a Russian socialite . Dasha Zhukova, the partner of . Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich and editor-in-chief of . bi-annual art and fashion magazine Garage, was born in Moscow but grew up in California. The 32-year-old's father is a prominent Russian businessman and oil magnate and her mother was a Russian . scientist. Her parents split when she was 3 and she and her mother moved to the US . when she was 10. She went to a privileged Jewish day school in California and graduated the University of California, Santa Barbara . before returning to Moscow and later moving to London. In . 2008, Zhukova founded the IRIS Foundation, a non-profit organization . dedicated to promoting contemporary culture. A year later, she was . appointed editor-in-chief of the fashion magazine Pop but she only . lasted three issues. She and Abramovich, who is worth $14 billion, have . two children Aaron Alexander, born 3 December 2009 and Leah Lou, born 15 . April 2013. Abramovich has five other children from a previous . relationship. Zhukova's was previously with Marat Safin, the retired . former Tennis World Champion Number 1 but the couple split in 2005. 'The art and fashion industries are . the few bastions of society where blatant racism and ignorance are given . the greenlight in the name of creativity,' Sulmers complained. Twitter erupted after Duma published the article, presumably not realizing citizens in the U.S. and around the world were remembering the Civil Rights movement and Martin Luther King's struggles for racial equality. User Ric Caric wrote, 'I guess Garage Magazine thought that today would be a great day to advertise their racism,' while Julee A. Wilson tweeted, 'MLK is turning in his grave and I'm cursing these people's stupidity with all my heart and soul! MAJOR fail!' User Nikia tweeted: 'Extremely disappointed in Miroslava Duma and Buro247 for posting this nonsense, especially on a day like today. smh,' and Alex von Tunzelmann wrote, 'Even in the grim, tasteless world of fashion photography, this revolting racist image- pub'd on MLK Day!- stands out.'

"Sentenced: Former NFL star Sam Hurd was sentenced to 15 years in jail on Wednesday for buying large amounts of illegal drugs . Disgraced former Chicago Bears player Sam Hurd was yesterday sentenced to 15 years in prison for his role in starting a drug-distribution scheme that ended his football career and left his future in tatters. Hurd, 28, received the punishment in a federal courtroom in Dallas after pleading guilty in April to one count of trying to buy and distribute large amounts of cocaine and marijuana. The charge carried a minimum 10-year sentence and a maximum of life. Authorities say that while NFL teammates and friends knew him as a hardworking wide receiver and married father, Hurd was fashioning a separate identity as a wannabe drug kingpin with a focus on 'high-end deals' and a need for large amounts of drugs. U.S. District Judge Jorge Solis gave Hurd a much shorter sentence than the 27 to 34 years recommended by federal sentencing guidelines. Solis noted that the case against Hurd centered on a 'lot of agreements' to buy and sell marijuana and cocaine, rather than physical transactions of drugs. But, the judge said, 'You didn't just start nickel and diming it.' Hurd stood before him in orange jail scrubs after a rambling, emotional 30-minute plea for mercy. Behind him in the gallery were more than a dozen family members and friends. 'You had everything going for you,' Solis told Hurd, adding that he thought the case was a 'tragedy.' Federal inmates are typically not eligible for parole and required to serve at least 85 percent of their sentences. Wide receiver: Sam Hurd during the NFL game between The Detroit Lions and the Dallas Cowboys . Hurd's December 2011 arrest outside a . suburban Chicago steakhouse came after he tried to buy a kilogram of . cocaine in what turned out to be a sting. According to a federal . complaint, Hurd told an undercover agent that he wanted 5 to 10 . kilograms of cocaine and 1,000 pounds of marijuana per week to . distribute in the Chicago area. He claimed he was already distributing 4 kilograms a week, according to the complaint. A kilogram is about 2.2 pounds. At the time, Hurd was a wide receiver with stints for the Bears and Dallas Cowboys who had played most of his five seasons on special teams. He was in the first year of a three-year contract reportedly worth more than $5 million. The Bears soon cut him. Hurd was released on bail and returned to Texas, where he grew up, but soon fell into trouble again, according to court documents. He allegedly tried to buy more cocaine and marijuana through a cousin, Jesse Tyrone Chavful, and failed two drug tests. That led a magistrate judge in August 2012 to revoke his bail and order him returned to jail. In court: Pictured is a courtroom artist drawing of Chicago Bears wide receiver Sam Hurd, center right, as he makes an initial court appearance before Judge Young Kim, left, on federal drug charges Thursday, December 15, 2011 in Chicago . Hurd spoke near the end of a . four-hour hearing, sometimes reading from handwritten notes and . sometimes looking directly at Solis to plead for mercy. While . he denied leading a major conspiracy or dealing with Chavful, Hurd . admitted to having a marijuana addiction and a weakness for friends who . needed his help. He admitted giving $88,000 to another co-defendant, . Toby Lujan, knowing that the money might go to buy drugs. And he . admitted the fateful meeting at a steakhouse that ended in his arrest. 'I regret not thinking about the consequences,' Hurd said, adding: 'I made some dumb, very bad decisions.' His attorneys tried to explain his claims of having high-value customers and massive demand for drugs as mere boasting, saying he had a penchant for exaggeration. One of his lawyers, Michael McCrum, called his client 'a guy showing up at a restaurant, talking stupid.' 'I think he should be punished, but for the crime that he committed,' McCrum said. Short sentence: U.S. District Judge Jorge Solis gave Hurd, pictured in 2011, a much shorter sentence than the 27 to 34 years recommended by federal sentencing guidelines . But Hurd's failed drug tests and alleged . dealings with Chavful appeared to factor heavily against him Wednesday. Prosecutors repeatedly brought up Chavful - rejecting claims by Hurd . and his attorneys that the two men were talking about Hurd's attempts to . start a T-shirt printing business. 'Normally, when you dig a hole, you quit digging,' said prosecutor John Kull. 'But he keeps digging.'Chavful and Lujan have both pleaded guilty to being involved in the conspiracy. Solis gave Chavful eight years in prison for his smaller role in the scheme. Lujan will be sentenced in January. While no other NFL players are known to have been charged in connection with the case, Hurd claimed in an interview published Tuesday by Sports Illustrated that he shared marijuana with Cowboys teammates and smoked during the last three to four years of his career 'all day, every day.' But while he gained extra notoriety due to his now-finished football career, prosecutors said Hurd's case was simple. 'He's not being prosecuted because he's an NFL player,' Kull said. 'He's being prosecuted because he's a drug dealer.'","Sam Hurd, 28, received the punishment Wednesday in a federal courtroom in Dallas, Texas .

The stunt was filmed as part of the next series of the show, which Watch has confirmed will be the final one. Mr Frayne said: 'I’ve been working with Variety, the children’s charity, and I invited some of the children they support to meet me at The View from the Shard as it is one of the best places to see London.

"A sickening photograph has emerged of a tiny baby lying on an ISIS flag surrounded by guns and hand grenades. The chilling image is the latest photo believed to have been posted by militants fighting in Syria and Iraq as part of their online propaganda campaign. It shows the child - who appears to be less than six months old - lying on its back on the black flag now associated with the group terrorising the Middle East. Where other babies its age might have soft toys scattered around them, the  child has been cynically positioned next to a Kalashnikov rifle, a pistol and hand grenades. Scroll down for video . A shocking image of a baby lying on an ISIS flag surrounded by weapons has been posted online . It follows a series of chilling photos put up by the group as part of their propaganda campaign, including this picture of a seven-year-old son of a militant holding a severed head . The baby in the image - which was posted on Twitter beneath the hashtag #IS - is believed to be youngest child yet used as part of the group's social media campaign. The photo caused a furious backlash online, with one user accusing the organisation of using 'babies as weapons to kill the innocent'. The picture is the latest in a series of shocking images which raise fears that a generation of children in the region are being radicalised from a very young age. Last month, terrorist Khaled Sharrouf posted a Twitter image of his son, believed to be age seven, gripping the severed head of a Syrian soldier. His  father, a suspected war criminal, posted the photo alongside the caption: 'That's my boy!'. Another photo posted by Sharrouf shows him posing with his three young sons dressed in identical camouflage fatigues and wielding machine guns. The latest image came after terrorist Khaled Sharrouf posted images of himself with his gun-wielding sons . Another image spread online by the group shows a  boy barely school age clutching an automatic rifle . Earlier this week, disturbing footage emerged of a masked child firing an AK47 assault rifle while shouting Islamic slogans in Syria. Two short videos apparently filmed near Damascus were uploaded to YouTube by an user calling themselves Abd Sad. They show a young boy, who appears to be no older than six-years-old, being instructed to fire the weapon by an man who then praises him and encourages him to join in religious chanting. ISIS - which rebranded as Islamic State earlier this year after establishing a so-called caliphate in Syria and Iraq - has made it a policy to groom children to take part in jihad, brainwashing them from a young age before packing them off to training camps when they reach their teens. The Daily Star reported this morning that Scottish public schoolgirl Aqsa Mahmood, who moved to Syria and married an ISIS fighter, has also posted a similar photo of a baby holding a Kalashnikov online. Amnesty International this week accused ISIS of carrying out a systematic campaign of mass killings, abductions and ethnic cleansing in northern Iraq that could amount to war crimes.

"America last night said it had the first proof that sarin gas was used by Syria in an attack that killed more than 1,400 civilians. Secretary of State John Kerry claimed samples of hair and blood provided to the US by people in Damascus had ‘tested positive’ for the nerve agent. He said that President Bashar Assad has now ‘joined the list of Adolf Hitler and Saddam Hussein’ in deploying chemical weapons against his population. He added that the case for a military attack was getting ‘stronger by the day’ – which follows the leak of a report by French spies that Assad has stockpiled more than 1,000 tonnes of poison gas including sarin. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad (right), pictured meeting with Iranian head of parliament's national security and foreign affairs commission, Aladin Borujerdi in Damascus, has vast stockpiles of poison gas, according to a French intelligence report . Responsibility: French agents say Assad's regime is behind the nerve gas attack in the Duma neighbourhood of Damascus on August 21 . On Saturday, President Barack Obama . said there would be no reprisals until Congress voted on military action . after its summer break on September 9. In theory, as commander-in-chief of US forces, he could ignore any vote that refuses to authorise missile strikes. Opposition . politicians warned the president might struggle to secure backing. Even . Republican congressman Peter King, who supports military action against . Assad, said: ‘I think it is going to be difficult’. But bullish Mr . Kerry said of a Congress vote: ‘We are not going to lose.’ Military action: Chancellor George Osborne said there would be no fresh attempt to persuade MPs to go to war with Syria . Speaking . of the evidence of chemical weapons use in Syria, he added: ‘I can . share with you today that blood and hair samples that have come to us . through an appropriate chain of custody, from east Damascus, from first . responders, it has tested positive for signatures of sarin.’ It . was the first time Washington has pinpointed the chemical used in the . attack on Ghouta, a rebel-held area of the Syrian capital on August 21. Mr Kerry added: ‘So this case is building and this case will build.’ Assad . remained defiant last night in the face of possible military strikes, . insisting Syria was ‘capable of confronting any external aggression’. The . tyrant said the threat of a bombardment would not discourage the regime . from its ‘principles’ of crushing the rebels, who he described as . ‘terrorists’. Syrian Deputy . Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad mocked President Obama’s decision to . consult Congress as showing ‘hesitation and confusion’. Yesterday it . emerged that details of the huge arsenal of chemical weapons stockpiled . by Syria have been unearthed by French spies. Assad has amassed more than 1,000 tonnes of poison gas including sarin and VX, the most toxic nerve agent ever created. A . leaked intelligence report said the tyrant possessed missiles capable . of firing the substances 300 miles – within range of British military . bases in Cyprus. Syrian refugees are seen behind a fence at a detention centre in Bulgaria, where they have fled to from a civil war that has claimed more than 110,000 lives .

Secret . service chiefs in Paris also blamed the Syrian government for the . massacre, which the US claims killed 1,429 civilians including 426 . children. Assad’s henchmen . fired projectiles containing sarin into a rebel-held suburb simply to . ‘cause terror’, they concluded. The four-page briefing paper was . compiled by agents working for the Direction Generale de la Securité . Exterieure, the French equivalent of MI6 and the Direction du . Renseignement Militaire, the military intelligence corps. The . memo was sent to President François Hollande, who has vowed to join . military action to punish ‘those who took the heinous decision to gas . innocents’. Mr Hollande is due to publish the document this week in a bid to convince the French public to back missile strikes. He . came under fresh pressure yesterday to consult the French parliament . about taking military action, following the example of Mr Obama. The leaked intelligence reports disclosed that Assad had accumulated one of the world’s biggest chemical arsenals. A U.S. Air Force plane takes off from the Incirlik airbase, in Turkey, today.

World War, the tasteless and odourless nerve agent odourless VX and . hundreds of tonnes of sarin gas. Escalation: President Obama said Saturday he will ask the U.S. Congress to authorise military action against Syria . The . dictator also has an arsenal of bombs capable of dropping up to 300 . litres of sarin, as well as Scud, Grad and SS21 missiles with a range of . 310 miles and artillery shells which could fire poison gas 30 miles. A . French intelligence source said: ‘We have had the Syrian chemical . weapons in our sights for more than 25 years.’ The . report said Syria used a series of fake companies to buy chemicals, . supposedly for legitimate purposes, which it then used as weapons.

"Retired Italian rider Roberto Gaggioli says Lance Armstrong paid him $100,000 in 1993 in order to win the Million Dollar Race in the United States. 'It was a young American colleague,' Gaggioli, who is now 51, was quoted as saying. 'He offered me a panettone (a traditional Italian Christmas cake) as a present and wished me a merry Christmas.

"Links to killer: Moazzam Begg, was formerly held in Guantanamo Bay, and was stripped of his passport earlier this week . The head of an Islamic pressure group linked to one of Lee Rigby’s murderers has been stripped of his passport amid claims that he is involved in terrorism. Moazzam Begg, a former inmate of Guantanamo Bay, was stopped at Heathrow Airport last week after returning from a visit to South Africa. He was told that it was ‘not in  the public interest’ for him to keep his passport as the Home Office suspected him of being involved in terrorist activities following his visit to Syria last year. The move came two days before Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale were convicted. Mr Begg’s group, CagePrisoners, had been working with Adebolajo and his family. The killer had gone to the charity’s East London headquarters last year to seek assistance, complaining that  he and his brother Jeremiah were being harassed by the security services. However, as The Mail on Sunday revealed in June, MI6 paid Jeremiah thousands of pounds as part of spying operations in the Middle East. Last night Mr Begg said he believed the Home Office was trying to discredit him after he gave evidence to an inquiry into Britain’s alleged complicity in rendition and torture - and that his passport seizure had nothing to do with the Woolwich murders. ‘I didn’t meet him [Adebolajo], it was other people at CagePrisoners who met him,’ he said. ‘I have consistently been asking for the intelligence and security services to be held to account for complicity in torture and rendition. It is more logical that is the reason I’ve had my passport confiscated.’ Mr Begg said that he gave evidence to Sir Peter Gibson, who last week concluded that British agents had turned a ‘blind eye’ to the torture of detainees in foreign jails. Mr Begg told The Mail on Sunday that he was stopped after returning from South Africa to commemorate the death of Nelson Mandela. He said he was pulled to one side by two plainclothes security officials who said that ‘having a passport was not a right and that they were using Royal Prerogative powers to take it away’. MI6 connection: Mail on Sunday story from June . A Home Office order given to Mr Begg stated that it was not in the public interest for him to have a passport as he had been assessed as being involved in terrorist activity because of his Syria visit. But Mr Begg told The Mail on Sunday that he had visited Aleppo to investigate the rendition and torture of Syrian and other nationals, gathering evidence against the UK and America. He said the visit had been cleared by MI5, who thanked him for telling them about it and assured him that he would have no trouble visiting Syria. The Home Office declined to comment on an individual case, but said the Royal Prerogative power ‘disrupts individuals who seek to travel on a British passport to engage in terrorism-related or other serious criminal activity abroad which impacts on the UK’.

"Verdict: Theodore Wafer stares straight ahead after being convicted of second-degree murder and manslaughter as his attorney Cheryl Carpenter comforts him on Thursday . A jury convicted a suburban Detroit homeowner of second-degree murder and manslaughter on Thursday in the killing of a drunk, unarmed woman on his porch last year, rejecting his claim that he was afraid for his life and had acted in self-defense. Theodore Wafer showed no emotion as he was convicted of shooting Renisha McBride in the face through a screen door on November 2, hours after she crashed into a parked car a half-mile from his house. No one knows why she ended up at the Dearborn Heights home, although prosecutors speculated that the 19-year-old woman may have been seeking help. 'She just wanted to go home,' prosecutor Patrick Muscat said during closing arguments, holding the shotgun Wafer used to kill McBride. 'She ended up in the morgue with bullets in her head and in her brain because the defendant picked up this shotgun, released this safety, raised it at her, pulled the trigger and blew her face off.' In addition to the murder conviction, . the jury also convicted Wafer of voluntary manslaughter and a felony . firearm charge and he was immediately taken into custody. He faces a life term in prison as a result of his guilty verdict at his sentencing on August 21. Relief: Monica McBride, mother of Renisha McBride, cries during the reading of verdict of guilty of of second-degree murder and manslaughter for Theodore Wafer . Grief: Monica McBride, mother of Renisha McBride cries during the reading of verdict of guilty of of second-degree murder and manslaughter in Detroit . McBride's parents, Monica and Walter Simmons said that they were pleased with the verdict. They added though, that they wouldn't be here if he had just dialled 911 that morning. 'Me and Walter know who she was,' McBride said of her daughter. 'She was not violent. She was a regular teenager...Her life mattered.' Wayne County Judge Dana Hathaway warned that she would lock people up for any outbursts, and the courtroom was silent after the verdict was read. McBride's mother, Monica McBride, cried and clasped her hands as if praying when the jury's decision was announced. She gave long hugs to prosecutors as the courtroom emptied. Wafer, who had been free on bond, was ordered to jail to await his sentence. He faces up to life in prison on Aug. 21, but it's likely his punishment will be much shorter. Crestfallen: This is the moment that Theodore Wafer was informed that he had been found guilty of the second degree murder of Renisha McBride . Justice: Parents Monica and Walter Simmons said that they were pleased with the verdict against Theodore Wafer . Guilty: Theodore Wafer testifies in his own defense during the seventh day of testimony for the November, 2013, killing of Renisha McBride earlier this week . 'He was a cold-blooded killer. ... People have a right to bear arms, but you need to do it with reason and responsibility,' McBride's father, Walter Simmons, told reporters. The Wayne County jury of seven men and five women heard eight days of testimony before beginning deliberations. Wafer, 55, could face up to life in prison with the possibility of parole, but it is likely his actual sentence will be much shorter. Wafer, an airport maintenance employee who lives alone, said he was roused out of sleep around 4:30 am by pounding at his front and side doors. He testified that the noises were 'unbelievable.' 'I wasn't going to cower in my house,' said Wafer, who has denied all accusations that race played a part in the tragedy from the start. He said he thought there could have been more than one person outside of his 1,100-square-foot home near the Detroit-Dearborn Heights border. Wafer said he pulled the trigger 'to defend myself. It was them or me.' Distraught: Karen Powell, aunt of Renisha McBride, holds a program at the funeral for McBride in Detroit on November 8, 2013 . 'He armed himself. He was getting attacked,' defense attorney Cheryl Carpenter told jurors. 'Put yourselves in his shoes at 4:30 in the morning.' But prosecutors said Wafer could have stayed safely in his locked home and called 911 instead of confronting McBride. 'He had so many other options. ... We wouldn't be here if he had called police first,' Muscat told the jury. Prosecutors earlier said that Wafer became the 'judge, jury and . executioner,' as he urged jurors to convict . him of second-degree murder of Renisha McBride, an African American woman. Prosecutors . in their closing arguments repeatedly emphasized that Theodore Wafer . had easier options than to directly confront 19-year-old Renisha McBride . when she showed up drunk on his porch before dawn on November  2. Several . hours earlier, she had crashed her car into a parked car on a Detroit . street about a half-mile from Wafer's house in Dearborn Heights. Trial: Asst. Prosecutor, Athina Siringas speaks during closing arguments in the Theodore Wafer case on Wednesday in Detroit . Wafer, . 55, said he shot McBride in self-defense. He said he awoke to an 'unbelievable' pounding on his doors and feared for his life when he . fired through a screen door as someone rushed from the side of the . porch. He shot McBride in the face, killing her. 'She . was a young girl looking for help,' prosecutor Patrick Muscat told . jurors. 'What he did had to be immediately necessary and it wasn't. It . was reckless. It was negligent. I don't know how to describe it. It was . horrific. 'How about . shutting the door? ... How about calling 911?' Muscat said. 'No, what he . does is he engages. He creates the confrontation.' Jurors . went home after deliberating about three hours Wednesday. They asked to . look at the clips that held the screen, but Judge Dana Hathaway said no . because the clips weren't admitted as evidence. Wafer, . an airport maintenance worker who lives alone, is charged with . second-degree murder and manslaughter. The jury chose not to convict him of the . lesser charge of involuntary manslaughter and did clear Wafer of all charges. Denials: Theodore Wafer, (right), listens during closing arguments of his trial on Wednesday . Persuasion: Defense attorney Cheryl Carpenter holds a photo during closing arguments on Wednesday . Adamant: Asst. Prosecutor, Patrick Muscat presents closing arguments in the case of Waffen, a suburban Detroit homeowner who opened his front door and blasted an unarmed woman on his porch . 'He . armed himself. He was getting attacked,' defense attorney Cheryl . Carpenter said in her closing argument. 'Put yourselves in his shoes at . 4:30 in the morning.' But another prosecutor, Athina Siringas, said a murder conviction fits the case. Wafer 'decided to be judge, jury and executioner,' she said in a rebuttal argument. Earlier . this week, Wafer testified that he was terrified by the pounding on his . house. He had been sleeping in a recliner and said he couldn't . immediately find his phone to call police. In . the aftermath of the shooting, some wondered whether race was a factor . because Wafer is white and McBride was black. Race hasn't been an issue . at trial, although the prosecutor noted that McBride was 'African-American' while cross-examining Wafer on Tuesday. In . her closing remarks, Carpenter said race isn't a factor for the jury. She said Wafer was just a homeowner who was aware of crime in a . neighborhood that borders Detroit and wanted to protect himself. 'In . the heat of the moment our instincts are to survive,' she said. 'He did . not know it was a 19-year-old who got in a car crash at 1 a.m. What he . knew was someone was trying to get in. It's not for a good reason — it's . to hurt me.'","Detroit jury found Theodore Wafer, 55, guilty of the second degree murder of 19-year-old Renisha McBride .

"Attacker: Former 49ers and Raiders linesman Kwame Harris, 31, has been convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence and battery for beating his ex-boyfriend last year . Former 49ers linesman Kwame Harris has been convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence and battery for beating his ex-boyfriend after an argument over table manners. Harris, 31, was found guilty on Monday for the August 21, 2012, attack which left Dimitri Geier in hospital with facial fractures. However a jury in San Mateo County Superior Court acquitted Harris of felony domestic violence and felony assault counts. According to court documents, Harris and Geier, 36, were having dinner at Su Hong restaurant in Menlo Park, California. The pair had previously dated on and off for about four years and had lived together. Following the meal, Harris was going to drive Geier to San Francisco International Airport for a flight. But the men began to argue after Geier poured soy sauce on some rice, which upset Harris, according to a lawsuit Geier filed in San Mateo County in October 2012. Geier later wrote on his Facebook that his actions 'started an argument about me not having manners and class and triggered his rage.' Their argument escalated, with Harris refusing to take his ex-lover to the airport. Geier agreed to take a cab instead, but as they went to get his bags from Harris' car the dispute turned violent. Victim: Dimitri Geier was rushed to hospital with facial fractures after the attack . Harris accused Geier, 36, of stealing his underwear - a game the men reportedly used to play - and tried to pull down Geier's trousers to prove it. That's when the pair came to blows in the parking lot. SFGate.com reported Harris, at 6'7'' and 240 pounds, pinned Geier against a plate-glass window and hit him . several times in the face and head. Geier was rushed to hospital. He underwent surgery and had a metal plate inserted at O'Connor Hospital in San Jose. Harris' defense said the footballer acted in self-defense and only punched Geier once. Geier did not appear in court. Jurors heard a transcript of his testimony from Harris’ preliminary hearing. Venting: After the altercation, Dimitri Geier wrote on his Facebook page he believed his ex-boyfriend had 'rage issues' Hospitalized: Dimitri Geier (pictured) suffered facial fractures that required surgery and the insertion of a metal plate after the attack . Harris was charged with felony domestic . violence and assault using force, but was acquitted of these felonies in court on Monday, the last day of the five-day trial. 'We're . relieved that they acquitted him of the felonies, which tells us that . they believe the truth - that he did act in self-defense,' Alin Cintean, Harris' attorney, said. Clintean said Harris plans to appeal the misdemeanor convictions. Geier sued Harris in October 2012, but withdrew the complaint about six months ago, his attorney, Craig Charles, said. 'I had hoped that it would move forward, but ultimately, the decision is his,' Charles said. Harris is scheduled to return to court on November 12 for sentencing. He faces up to a year in jail. Harris, . an offensive tackle, attended Stanford University and was the 49ers' top draft pick in 2003. He spent five seasons with the team, then played . for the Raiders in 2008, his last year in the NFL. The criminal case exposed that Harris had been secretive about his sexual orientation before retiring from the NFL. According to USA Today, his outing was met with a negative reaction from some players. 'You want to escape the despair and turmoil and your mind goes to dark places,' Harris said in March of keeping his sexuality secret. 'I'm happy today, and I'm glad they were just ideas and I didn't act on any of them. 'The cost was great in asking me to not speak candidly or be able to be open about myself in a complete manner. 'If I could have done it differently, I would have hoped I found the strength [to come out].'

"The thick pea-soupers that hung over British cities until the 1950s live on in the memory of those who experienced the life threatening smogs. But a new collection of photographs featuring Pittsburgh in the 1940s and 1950s show people living in the American industrial city suffered just as badly. Pollution was once so bad in Pittsburgh that it could block out the midday sun. The scale of the problem is revealed in pictures from the Smoke Control Lantern Slide Collection at the archives of the University of Pittsburgh. Danger: Crowds of people in Pittsburgh go about their business with a thick smog visibly filling the air and clouding the tops of surrounding buildings . Daylight: The smog in 1950s Pittsburgh was so thick at times that it could block out the midday sun, but for decades people were unaware of the dangers the thick clouds of coal smoke and industrial pollution posed to people's health in the U.S. city . Danger: Clouds of choking pollution once shrouded the skyscrapers of Pittsburgh before authorities took action by banning the burning of coal in the American city . The problem in Pittsburgh had been a long standing one with Victorian-era British novelist and Londoner Anthony Trollope writing that Pittsburgh was 'without exception is the blackest place which I ever saw'. Despite . his grimy review, the lack of alternative fuels in the 19th century . made introducing smoke controls difficult. Also lots of people thought . that high smoke output was a sign of high productivity and that coal . smoke was good for the lungs and helped crops grow. The photographic collection was put together to highlight the history of the city's smoke control laws which were first passed in 1941, but then delayed by the Second World War leaving residents choking in the fumes for more than a decade longer. Looming: As cars and pedestrians go about their daily business the thick clouds of smog cut down visibility, leaving the view between the city's tall buildings hidden even during the day . Horror: The collection of Pittsburgh smog pictures has been put together by the U.S. city's university to show how bad the problem was and how laws were eventually introduced to restrict the burning of coal to tackle the dangerous problem . Past: The smog which engulfed Pittsburgh for decades was initially thought to be good for crops and a proud symbol of the city's industrial progress and energy . An essay called Pittsburg by James Parton which first appeared in The Atlantic Monthly's January 1868 edition detailed how the problem had been plaguing the city since the 19th century. He described conditions in the city, where 230,000 people lived at the time, by writing 'walking up a long hill to Cliff Street in Pittsburg, and looking over into hell with the lid taken off.' He said: 'The town lies low, as at the bottom of an excavation, just visible through the mingled smoke and mist, and every object in it is black. Smoke, smoke, smoke - everywhere smoke.' Industry: This picture shows a factory chimney spewing out smoke in the city, adding to Pittsburgh's intense air pollution problem which was once so bad the midday sun could be blocked out . Visibility: The Pittsburgh smog hides a huge building even at close range, with the upper floors invisible and the buildings outline blurred by the combination of industrial pollution and coal fire smoke . While air quality in Pittsburgh have improved greatly since the 1950s, the thick pea soupers which can kill young and elderly people, remain a problem in newly industrialised countries. In China last week foreign embassies were warned by a senior official that issuing air pollution readings were illegal and interfering in its internal business. Official forecasts in the Chinese capital Beijing, which is home to 20 million people, often predict light pollution - even when the city is shrouded in haze. Life: Car exhaust fumes added to the Pittsburgh smog which was a problem in the industrialised U.S. city for decades until new laws on burning coal were introduced in the 1950s . Shroud: Industrialisation brought wealth to Pittsburgh, but the resulting smog became to high a price to pay with officials eventually realising action was needed to tackle the longstanding problem .","The pea-souper problem was once so bad that clouds of smoke and pollution would block out the midday sun .
Photographs from the 1950s show just how badly the U.S. city suffered before laws on coal burning were introduced ."
"Russia is set to raise the stakes in Syria by sending two warships and a team of crack marines to the strife-torn country.

But some western analysts saw the planned deployment as a clear signal to the US and its western allies that Moscow would not tolerate any foreign military intervention to end the bloody 15-month crackdown on rebel forces in Syria. President Obama, sitting stony-faced with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Los Cabos, Mexico, yesterday, insisted both leaders were working on a 'political solution' to stop the bloodshed. No mention was made of the disagreements that have divided the two countries or on Russia's warships plan. But in what could be a sign of progress, they agreed the Syrian people should choose their own government. After . two hours of talks on the sidelines of the G-20 economic summit, . relations between the two men still appeared tense. Nervous times: President Obama, sitting stony-faced with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Los Cabos, Mexico at the G-20 summit. Obama said both leaders were working on a 'political solution' to stop the bloodshed . Nevertheless, their . comments mark a subtle shift for both countries as they confront the . prospect that Russia's main ally in the Middle East could slide into . civil war. Criticised: Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has been accused of endangering peace in the Middle East with his increasingly bloody crackdown on opponents . One defence source was quoted last night as claiming the Russian marines were being sent to Syria because the Kremlin fears the West is plotting to circumvent the United Nations Security Council by unilaterally agreeing to military action. Another possibility is that Russia is losing faith in the beleaguered Syrian regime's ability to withstand outside pressures for much longer. 'We must protect out citizens,' Major General Vladimir Gradusov, a deputy Russian air force chief, was quoted as saying last night. 'We won't abandon the Russians and will evacuate them from the conflict zone if necessary,' he added.Russia remains one of Syria's most steadfast allies and has sold Damascus large quantities of weapons and defence equipment. However, the US has refused to arm anti-Assad rebels in part to avoid a proxy fight in which Iran, Russia and others arm one side and America and Sunni Arab states arm the other. Just last week, the Russians denied US claims that it was sending ships to help prop up Assad's government. Opposition groups estimate 14,000 people have died in violence that the U.S. fears is sliding into civil war.

"A 54-year-old . white man has been left barely clinging to life after he was brutally beaten by a group of black men when he got out of his car to check on a young black boy he accidentally hit. Steve Utash, . from suburban Roseville, was beaten into a coma Wednesday by an angry . mob in a poverty-stricken Detroit neighborhood after David Harris, 10, ran in . front of his truck on a busy street, but police insist the incident was . not racially motivated. The gang also stole his wallet before leaving him for dead. Utash . is in extremely critical condition with severe head wounds, Detroit . Police spokesperson Jennifer Moreno told MailOnline. It is not known if . he will survive. 'If it went on any longer, my dad wouldn’t be in the hospital right now, he would be in the morgue,' son Joseph Utash told CBS Detroit. Attacked: Steve Utash, pictured with wife Starr Utash, is still in a coma after being beaten on April 2 . On the mend: David Harris, 10, is expected to make a full recovery after being hit by Steve Utash's vehicle . Group of friends: Four individuals are shown . standing by the side of the road at left and Harris can be seen darting . head on into traffic at right . Security . footage from a gas station Harris and friends were standing in front of . shows him inexplicably running into oncoming traffic before being mowed . down by Utash's vehicle. Utash . immediately stops to check on the boy, but several black males from . their late teens to their early 20s quickly descend on the scene. Police quickly ruled the incident an accident. 'It was determined that the driver of the vehicle wouldn't have had any chance of stopping,' Moreno explained. But what happened next is considered by Utash's family to be an act of retaliation. Police . tell MailOnline that about a dozen young males attacked the married . father of three, beating him into a coma that he still hasn't woken from. Family man: Utash is a married father of two children - the relatives pictured are not identified . Moment of impact: Mr Utash hits David Harris just after the boy ran into the street . On the ground: The young boy is crumpled in heap on the ground just after being hit . Released from the hospital: Harris suffered only a broken leg, he has already been sent home . 'It’s not like he hit the kid on purpose and they were trying to get revenge,' daughter Felicia Utash told WXYZ. 'He literally just tried to stop and help the kid and people came out of nowhere and tried to kill him.' His son Joseph Utash hinted it might have been a setup to rob his father, perhaps even a hate crime. 'I . think it was all a setup from the gate,' he told CBS Detroit. 'My dad’s . been driving up and down Morang for 15, 16 years working for the same . company... they know he has money and they robbed him. 'As far as a hate crime, it might be,' he continued. 'You go in Detroit and you’re white, you don’t belong.' Police immediately dismissed the notion. 'We have no evidence to suggest it's a hate crime,' Moreno told MailOnline. The . boy's father was arrested after a background check revealed he has an . active warrant, according to the Detroit Free-Press, but police declined to say if he would be charged in . connection with the beating. Mob rule: The angry mob that would soon mercilessly beat Utash begins gathering where the boy was struck . Devastated: Felicia Utash, pictured with Steve, says her father was only trying to do the right thing . Witnesses said Utash immediately pulled over to check on Harris after hitting him. ‘David was laying right in front of the . driveway and he had blood coming out of his mouth,’ James Duston Jr., . the boy’s godfather told WXYZ.  He couldn’t move his body.’ The crowd ran towards the boy's screams and mercilessly beat Utash. ‘This little boy was screaming,’ a woman told the Free Press. ‘There was a lot of people that came out. It was crazy.’ All hell broke loose. ‘I think it lasted about one minute and . then they let him go,’ a bystander told WXYZ. ‘And then they jumped back . on him again and they did it about three times and finally someone was . trying to help the guy that got beat up.’ ‘He had the biggest gash on his head I . ever seen – he was bleeding from the mouth and he was unconscious when I . first got there,’ Debra Hughes told WWJ. Harris suffered a broken leg, he has since been released from a local hospital, Moreno said. A message left with the family seeking further comment has not yet been returned. Brutal: The unidentified driver was savagely beaten after stopping to check on the young boy he accidentally hit with while driving this pickup truck . ‘It was sad because I knew the guy was getting out of his car to try and see what damage he did,’ the witness added. ‘He got his,’ another witness to the beating told the Free Press. ‘He got beat up real bad.’Both the driver and the boy were taken to a local hospital. The boy’s family condemned the beating. ‘We don’t condone that at all,’ said Duston. ‘I told his mom and she just was like, no, we wouldn’t want that to happen.’ Doctors are still trying to determine if Utash will need surgery to save his life.

"Tragic death: Kent Snyder, former campaign manager for Ron Paul, died from pneumonia because he was unable to afford medical insurance . Ron Paul's former campaign manager died from complications caused by pneumonia because he couldn't afford health insurance, it has emerged. The details surrounding the 2008 death of Kent Snyder were revealed by Gawker after the Tea Party candidate indicated he did not agree with free state health care for the poor. Mr Snyder, 49, died on June 26, 2008, with hospital costs totalling $400,000 after he became ill with viral pneumonia. The bill for his care was sent to his . mother, who was unable to pay, and so a website was set up by friends . to secure donations. Mr Paul's election campaign did not provide workers . with medical insurance. At . the time, Mr Snyder's sister was quoted in the Kansas City Star as . saying that a 'pre-existing condition made the premiums too expensive' for the campaign manager. It . comes after Mr Paul, a physician and opponent of federal healthcare, . appeared to suggest people who fell ill should be left to fend for . themselves, even if they don't have health care, during a Tea Party . debate. On Monday night, the candidates - who also included Michele Bachmann and Mitt Romney - were asked whether the state should pay health care bills for an uninsured young man who suddenly found himself ill. Mr Paul said: 'That's what freedom is all about - taking your own risks. 'This whole idea that you have to take care of everybody...' He did not finish the answer as a the partisan crowd drowned him out with applause. The value of a life? Mr Paul makes a point during the Tea Party debate in Tampa, Florida, on Monday . Partisan: A boisterous crowd at the debate cheered when CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer suggested that a young man without insurance who fell ill should be left to die . More money is spent on health care per person in the U.S. than anywhere else in the world. Most Americans get their health insurance through their employer, by paying premiums from wages. The government also funds some public schemes, including Medicare, Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program. The remainder are left without health insurance. Last year, the number of people without cover reached nearly 50 million. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act signed into law by President Obama last year aims to expand eligibility for medical cover, subsidise premiums and provide incentives for companies to give health care benefits. Most Republicans, including the Tea Party, strongly oppose the act and it was only passed with major amendments. But when CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer asked if meant that 'society should just let him die', Mr Paul stopped short of agreeing. He responded that it was up to churches to care for the dying young man, but the audience voiced their support of the idea. After Mr Snyder's death, Ron Paul posted a message on his campaign website. He said: 'Like so many in our movement, Kent sacrificed much for the cause of liberty. 'Kent . poured every ounce of his being into our fight for freedom. He will . always hold a place in my heart and in the hearts of my family.' Mr Paul withdrew from the election race two weeks after Mr Snyder's death, but having raised millions for his campaign. Many conservative Christian voters agree with Mr Paul's idea that individuals and churches should have authority over healthcare, as many are worried about federal funding directed to birth control. During the debate, Mr Paul said: 'We've given up on this whole concept that we might take care of ourselves and assume responsibility for ourselves, our neighbours, our friends, our churches would do it. 'The cost is so high because we dump it on the government. It becomes a bureaucracy. It becomes special interests. It kowtows to the insurance companies, then the drug companies.' None of the candidates disapproved of the idea of individuals funding their own healthcare or remarked on the audience reaction. One critic, Eddie Vale of the Protect Your Care group, told the Los Angeles Times it was like a 'spectacle one would have expected back in the gladiatorial combat of ancient Rome'. Census data released last week showed that the number of people without medical insurance in the U.S. went up to almost 50 million in 2010. Mr Snyder is credited with turning his one-man operation into a phenomenon now calling itself 'The Freedom Movement'. He persuaded Mr Paul to run for office and launched his campaign on his own computer in his apartment in Arlington, Virginia. From there he built it into a $35million operation with 250 employees that secured more than a million votes for Mr Paul's nomination. Jesse Benton, a spokesman for the Texas congressman, said: 'It was Kent more than anyone else who encouraged and pushed Ron to run for president. 'Ron would not have run for the presidency if it had not been for Kent.' Although he was unsuccessful in securing the nomination, his campaign has attracted a strong group of support drawn to his libertarian strain of conservatism. His opposition to the Iraq war set the 72-year-old apart from other Republican presidential candidates. Mr Snyder began in politics as a volunteer on Ronald Reagan's failed 1976 bid to win the Republican presidential nomination. He met Mr Paul in 1987 and also worked on his unsuccessful 1988 presidential bid on the Libertarian ticket.","Kent Snyder died from complications caused by pneumonia because his premiums were too expensive .

"A 17-year-old Texas boy is in a coma after being tasered last week by a Texas police officer in a school hallway after he ‘tried to break up a fight between two girls’. Noe Nino de Rivera had stepped in to break up a fight between the girls at Cedar Creek High School on November 20, according to his mother, Maria Acosta. Bastrop County Deputy, Randy McMillan, arrived at the scene and tasered de Rivera, who fell on his face and was knocked unconscious. Intervened: Noe Nino de Rivera, 17, had stepped in to break up a fight between two girls at Cedar Creek High School on November 20 . Coma: The boy is now in a coma with 'permanent brain damage' after the police officer tasered him and he fell on his face . Sued: Bastrop County Deputy, Randy McMillan, reportedly handcuffed the boy while he was on the floor unconscious after he hit his head and had a brain hemorrhage . McMillan reportedly then handcuffed the unconscious boy, who had only been trying to ‘diffuse the situation’, according to Courthouse News Service. de Rivera's devastated mother is now suing Bastrop County, its school district and McMillan, who works as the school resource officer. She claims in the suit that school officials ‘delayed in calling for medical assistance even though N.N. was in an obvious emergency medical situations’. The teenager was airlifted to St. David's Medical Center, where he immediately underwent surgery to repair a severe brain hemorrhage and was placed in a medically-induced coma. de Rivera remains in a coma, and has not been able to communicate with his family since his hospitalization, according to the lawsuit. The mother claims McMillan never was in . danger, and that the defendants let him work at the school even after he . shot a student with a taser a year ago. That created a ‘foreseeable danger’ that led to her son's injuries, she claims. Devastated: de Rivera's mother, Maria Acosta, says her son still cannot communicate with them after the incident last week . Overreaction: Students who saw the incident say McMillan overreacted and did not need to taser the teenager, who is now in a coma . She seeks medical expenses and damages for excessive force, failure to train and discipline and civil rights and education code violations. Students who saw the incident say McMillan overreacted. ‘There was a crowd watching and the kid was just trying to get the officers to listen to him,’ said one student to KXAN. ‘When he shot the taser, there was a crowd, and others could have been hit.’ The incident is under investigation and McMillan has been placed on patrol until the investigation is complete. According to the Bastrop County Sheriff's Office, McMillan has never received complaints for using excessive force, and he's never been disciplined for using excessive force. Lawsuit: Rivera's mother is now suing Bastrop County, its school district and McMillan, who worked as the school resource officer at Cedar Creek High School in Bastrop, Texas . Sissy Jones of the Bastrop County Sheriff's Office, there is a video of the incident showing de Rivera 'being aggressive' But the sheriff says he wants to make sure proper protocol was used in this case, so he's waiting to see the final report. According to Sissy Jones of the Bastrop County Sheriff's Office, there is a video of the incident showing de Rivera 'being aggressive'. 'He is not complying with any of the verbal orders,' she told Fox News. Jones said, 'One of the officers puts his hand on de Rivera's chest and says, you need to back up and that's when de Rivera hits the officer's hand.' Acosta said de Rivera was just talking about joining the Marines. Now she says she just hopes he wakes up. The teen may still face charges once the investigation is complete, according to KXAN.","Noe Nino de Rivera, 17, had to have emergency brain surgery after Bastrop County Deputy, Randy McMillan, tasered him .

"It was a money-making opportunity that could have gone either way - and could have only have been pulled off by the most tech-savvy of people. A college student has somehow been able to amass over $24,000 by waving a sign at a television camera. The hopeful venture started on Saturday with the ESPN show College GameDay, a football program that is filmed at a different campus each weekend and was in Auburn, Alabama. The student came armed with a banner that had seemed to plea for money from his mother. It also included the logo for Bitcoin, a US payment network, and a QR code, which is a scan-sensitive icon used to represent information, according to cryptojunky.com. Clever currency: A joke by a college student (pictured in yellow), who held up a sign on TV with the details to an online banking network, really paid off - literally - with the guy garnered over $24,000 in donations . Close up: The sign, which was seemingly appealing to the students mother, contained the icon of 'crypto-currency' network Bitcoin (right) and a QR code (left) linking people to his account with the payment-sharing website . QR codes often appear in magazines, allowing readers to link into websites with their phones for the purpose of online shopping and further reading, among other things. In this case the QR code was for the student's Bitcoin account, which is known as as an online 'wallet'. Somehow a screen grab of the TV show showing the man holding the sign made its way to social news website Reddit. Readers were able to enhance the QR to identify the code, allowing them to donate money. As the story picked up traffic, more people started to give donations. What started out as a small amounts quickly saw the guy recieve 100 transactions in not time at all. As it stands the sign holder has received 22 bitcoins, which are worth over $1,100 each. The value of the received coins comes to a total of $24,361.50. While Bitcoin makes all donations public, the identity of the people receiving funds are concealed behind their usernames. The student - has only been identified by his Reddit username, BitcoinPitcher2 - uses the Bitcoin user name '1HiMoMgBaAikFHgAt3M4YJtetp4HrnsiXu'. The proof is in the coins: A snapshot of the student's Bitcoin account, which is open to the public, shows he was received 22 Bitcoins, worth over $1,100 each. The donation button (bottom right) is what people used to hand over donations. There have recently been calls for the payment network to change their privacy settings to protect users . During the early stages of the incoming transactions, BitcoinPitcher2 said he would be donating the majority of the money to a charitable group called Sean's Outpost, which is a homeless shelter and outreach group located in Pensacola, Florida. It is not known at present how much of the money will be donated. The student said the whole instance started as a 'joke'. He had started a Bitcoin wallet earlier this year by paying $101. When the amount 'grew rapidly' over the coming months, he decided he would use the sign to see if anyone would donate to help the amount grow. Bitcoin was launched five years and has come to known as 'crypto-currency'. Bitcoin supports believe it could one day become the global alternative to cash. Interestingly, the news comes as members of the finance world call for the privacy settings on Bitcoin to be more stringent to protect users, specifically from the data mining of the US NSA spy agency. Hackers are also constantly looking for ways to access people's Bitcoin wallets using the information offered to them online.","Unidentified college student holds a banner to an ESPN camera on Saturday pleading for money from his mother .

"Hunt: Director general Tony Hall announced a crackdown on licence-fee evaders on Tuesday . The BBC was accused of ‘hunting down hard-working people’ last night after it emerged that licence-fee collectors can earn a £1,000 bonus every month for hauling TV viewers to court. Critics said it was ‘outrageous’ that its 334 enforcement officers were offered ‘uncapped’ incentives to find the evidence the BBC needs to prosecute householders. They say the bonuses could encourage officers to harass householders. A record 180,000 court cases against fee evaders last year mean the BBC is responsible for more than one in ten criminal prosecutions, leading to complaints that it is clogging up the courts. The news follows director-general Tony Hall’s announcement on Tuesday that he plans a further crackdown on licence-fee evaders to help fill the £100million-a-year shortfall created by his ‘digital revolution’, which aims to put far more programmes online and double the BBC’s global audience. However, last night, Tory MP Rob Hall said: ‘It is outrageous to learn that the BBC is allowing bailiffs to be given incentives to pursue those who are struggling to pay their licence fee. ‘There is a gravy train for executives, an unaccountable commercial division beyond public control, and now bonuses for bailiffs to hunt down hard-working people.’ The BBC sub-contracts the collection of the £145.50 licence fee to private firm Capita. Last year, it signed an eight-year deal with the corporation worth £560million. Collectors knock on the doors of four million homes a year. They earn a basic salary plus ‘uncapped commission’ for taking statements from householders that can be used as evidence of evasion. Critics of the BBC's tactics warn people could be harassed as officers push to get their 'uncapped' bonus . In 2005, a collector was convicted of forging customer signatures to boost his bonus. It emerged in court that officers had to gather 38 statements a week to qualify for a bonus. They could get more than £700 a month on top of their salary. Details of the current bonuses have not been revealed, but collectors are estimated to earn up to £1,000. Last year, the BBC collected £3.7billion in licence fees. Some 5.8 per cent of households evade the licence fee. A spokesman said non-payers cost the BBC £216million last year, adding: ‘On behalf of the honest 95 per cent of people who do pay, we have a duty to enforce the law on those  who evade the fee.’","334 officers were offered 'uncapped' incentives to find evidence .

"Anti-capitalist demonstrators have constructed a ‘slum city’ made of wooden  shacks on an historic civic green. Campaigners camped in Bristol have replaced tents with huts built from  discarded wood and pallets and fitted with front doors and windows. Some have a range of home comforts including wood-burning stoves, wardrobes,  sofas and kitchen tables and chairs. Construction: The Occupy Bristol camp on College Green is becoming a slum city . Protesters said they eventually want to switch all the tents with what they  described as ‘mini houses’ that will reach up to three storeys high. The development came as protesters camped at St Paul’s Cathedral last night  flaunted a demand to leave sparking a legal battle expected to cost taxpayers  up to £1millon. The splinter Occupy Bristol protest began 34 days ago and picturesque College  Green is now littered with 60 tents. But locals are furious that the demonstrators are ruining the historic site,  which is overlooked by Bristol Cathedral. Conservative councillor Richard Eddy, 46, called for the ’immediate eviction’  of the group. DIY: The protesters have started building homes on the normally lush green lawn in the centre of the city . Bedding in: Washing up time around the wooden built structure at the centre of the anti-capital protest . He said: ‘I have seen the structures and the area is a real state of concern.  The sooner it is all removed and the protestors are evicted the better. ‘Obviously the process of clearing it up will be at the expense of the taxpayer  with the pressures on public finances. ‘It is a complete abuse to stay so long. It is a chronic shame that they have  and the longer they stay the more they are depriving the public of College  Green.’ The wooden pallets have been hammered together over the previously green grass  - now destroyed into mud - and the shacks have been built on top. Hard at work: Michael Watkins, 29, washes dishes on a hand built work surface as part of the Occupy protests . Protestors have even mapped out ‘roads’ through the camp made of pallets topped  with pieces of old carpet. They have also erected a gazebo reception area with chairs and cushions and  boards listing their aims. There are currently six shacks, including a communal kitchen area where food is  prepared. Occupy Bristol is the largest protest of its kind outside of London. The first Occupy protest began in September in Wall Street, where police in riot gear raided the camp and evicted dozens of protestors. But hours later the National Lawyers Guild obtained a court order allowing the protestors to return with their tents. In Britain, The City of London Corporation has attached eviction notices to tents on the public highway near to St Paul's Cathedral. They told protestors to leave the area before 6pm yesterday or legal proceedings would be issued in the High Court. One protestor, named only as Matt, 22, insisted that the camp would soon be  developed into a wooden city right in the heart of Bristol. He said: ‘Eventually we want to get rid of all the tents and live in these  wooden structures. ’They are temporary and we are not digging into the ground, so technically we  could pick them up and move them whenever we wanted. ’We want to create a slum city.’ The Very Rev Dr David Hoyle, Dean of Bristol Cathedral, also called for the  protestors to leave. He said: ‘The first of the structures went up over a week ago and since then  they have built more. ’It is of no surprise to me. They have . said all along that they are going to  stay here and they are now making . it more physically evident. Solidarity: Protesters pitch their tents at the second Occupy Glasgow camp in Blythswood Square . Long haul: (Left to right) Glasgow protesters Marina Gray, Emma Kane, Mark Porciani and Susan, who didn't give her surname . ‘It has become more visible and people are reacting to that. ‘At the moment we have no plans to evict them but we are asking them to leave  and we have done that formally.’ At St Paul’s Cathedral activists said not a single protester had left, despite  the Corporation of London warning them they had to pack up their tents by 6pm  last night or face a High Court injunction. As zero hour approached the rag tag group of anti-capitalists openly mocked the  threat and vowed to stay put in the cathedral’s churchyard. Together: The British protests are being held in solidarity with the Occupy Wall street demonstrators . Some protesters discussed plans for leaving making Christmas decorations and  the sign on one tent declared: 'Hell, no - we won't go!' Nathan Cravens, 27, who runs the camp library, said: ‘The general feeling is  excitement at the moment. It's brought us together.’ The eviction notice was issued after U.S. police cleared the Occupy Wall Street  movement camped in New York which had inspired the British protest. But legal experts said clearing the British protest is expected to be a  protracted legal battle that will rack up a huge legal bill. Adam Chapman, head of public law at Kingsley Napley, said because of the Human  Rights Act it could drag on for months. He said: ‘It will cost at least £10,000 to get it to the High Court and if  there is a lot of going back and forth with appeals as we expect, it will run  into the hundreds of thousands.’ With the added costs of policing the protest for months and clearing up the  mess made by protesters, the total bill to the taxpayer is expected to hit  £1million. Demonstrators have been camped outside St Paul’s since October 15 after an  attempt to occupy the nearby London Stock Exchange failed. Similar camps have also been set up in other parts of the country, including a  camp in the grounds of Exeter Cathedral. St Paul’s Cathedral decided not to join the legal action against the protesters.","Protesters at St Paul's have until 6pm to depart .

"Angry farmers have hit out against European Union rules which they claim will force cows to wear nappies. Under an EU nitrates directive, the use of fertilisers is being prohibited on hillsides with gradients of more than 15 per cent. The Bavarian farmers’ association fears the new rules effectively ban them from grazing cows on the slopes - because their cow pats might be construed as fertilising. German Farmer Johann Huber has created homemade nappies for his cows in protest to the new EU rules . The Upper-Bavarian Farm President Anton Kreitmar and Petra Duehring from the Bavarian Farmer's Union attach a diaper to Doris the cow in Gmund am Tegernsee, Germany, as part of the protest against the EU rules . Under EU rules, the use of fertilisers is being prohibited on hillsides with gradients of more than 15 per cent and farmers fear it effectively bans them from grazing cows because cow pats might be construed as fertilising . One German farmer, Johann Huber, whose family has farmed on the mountain slopes of Gmund am Tegernsee in the Alps for more than 400 years, has created homemade nappies in an unusual protest at the new rules. He had made them from large pieces of cloth so his 18 cows don’t fall foul of the fertiliser ban. Mr Huber said: ‘We have no standard nappies, they have not been developed commercially yet.’ Farmers in breach of the nitrates directive could lose their EU agricultural subsidies, worth thousands of Euros each year - while they fear that complying with the restrictions could also force many out of business. Anton Kreitmair, farmers’ association president in Upper Bavaria, said: ‘We demand that the ban is stopped in Germany. In Bavaria no fertilisation would be possible on half the cultivated land and restrictions would be needed on cows grazing in Alpine pastures.’ The farmers have made the nappies from large pieces of cloth so their cows don’t fall foul of the fertiliser ban . Mr Huber's family has farmed on the mountain slopes of Gmund am Tegernsee in the Alps for over 400 years . The European Union says its nitrates directive is necessary ‘to avoid leaching of nitrates and water pollution’. But a spokesman for the European Commission denied the ban would affect cattle. He said: ‘The directive does not foresee a ban on grazing animals on sloping land.’ The spokesman added that he believed it ‘unlikely’ that Germany would propose its own ban on grazing animals on sloping land.","German farmer has created 'nappies' for cows to protest against EU rules .

"A sister of the suspected Boston Marathon bombers appeared in a New Jersey court on Monday to face drug possession and distribution charges. Bella Tsarnaeva appeared in Superior Court in Hackensack, New Jersey, on marijuana charges after she was arrested in December 2012, just months before her brothers allegedly targeted the Boston Marathon in an attack that killed three people. Police had responded to a call to Tsarnaeva's Fairview home in response to domestic violence call and arrested her and boyfriend Ahmad Khalil after smelling marijuana coming from the apartment they shared. Bella Tsarnaeva, the sister of the two suspects in the Boston Marathon bombing, appeared in court in New Jersey on drug possession and distribution charges . Authorities say Tsarnaeva has not been implicated in the bombing that took place in downtown Boston on April 15, 2013. Tsarnaeva and Khalil pleaded not guilty last May when they made their first appearance in court to answer the drug charges. NJ.com reported that Bergen County prosecutors believed Tsarnaeva will be admitted to a pretrial intervention program. The case was adjourned until next month while prosecutors and attorneys worked out a plea deal for her co-defendant. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, left, was captured after a manhunt that shut down much of the city. His older brother Tamerlan, right, was killed in the chaotic aftermath of the bombing . Bella, 24, is one of two middle sisters of the suspected bombers.

"This is the dramatic moment two of Ukraine's ousted leaders crashed through a metal detector and wrestled airport staff to the ground as they made a desperate attempt to flee the country. Images shown on Ukrainian TV claim to show Prosecutor General Viktor Pshonka, tax minister Oleksandr Klimenko and their bodyguards in chaotic tussles resembling an action film. The pair, who were close allies of former president Viktor Vanukovych, were blocked from leaving the country in February after Ukraine's government collapsed amid violent protests. Scroll down for video . Dramatic: CCTV images claim to show the moment two of Ukraine's top ousted leaders tried to flee the country. Several men are shown hurtling through a security scanner in Donetsk Airport, knocking it to the ground . Bunfight: It is claimed the man with the white hair (centre) is ousted Prosecutor General Viktor Pshonka . Chaos: The escape bid was thwarted but Pshonka and Klimenko left the building after gunshots were fired . Their bodyguards fired on border guards at Donetsk Airport when they were thwarted in their bid to escape, officials said at the time of the incident on February 22. It was the same day Pshonka was ousted from the fast-collapsing regime with a vote of no confidence in Ukraine's parliament, as deadly clashes raged in the streets of the capital Kiev. An arrest warrant was issued for Pshonka the next day. In the images several men are seen hurtling through a security scanner in the airport's VIP lounge, knocking it to the ground. At one point the man reported to be Pshonka, in a black overcoat with a distinctive shock of white hair, elbows a clutch of guards trapped in the fallen metal detector before scrambling over them and hurling open the door. Interim prosecutor general Oleg Makhnytsky announced the details of the thwarted escape bid to the Ukrainian parliament. 'Measures have been taken to arrest Pshonka and Klimenko and initiate legal proceedings against them,' he said. Ousted interior minister Vitaliy Zakharchenko and other colleagues were also reportedly seen at the same airport on the same day, he added. Ousted: The escape bid in February was made on the same day Pshonka, pictured, lost a vote of no confidence . People's Republic of Donetsk?

Occupy Ukraine: A pro-Russian activist in the Donetsk building peers out from behind the barricades today . Yanukovych himself was said to have tried to leave Donetsk aboard a private plane. The former top politicians went on the run after leaving the airport building and their whereabouts are now unknown. The footage was revealed by the Ukrainian TV station IHTEP on YouTube yesterday and has already been viewed around 500,000 times. In the caption, State Border Service spokesman Sergey Astakhov was quoted as saying the pair escaped the airport building after their bodyguard shot at border staff. 'Protection of these citizens had physical resistance along the border, allowing them to leave the airport,' he said. Days later Pshonka's opulent mansion near the capital Kiev was stormed by anti-government protesters who revealed it was filled with crystal chandeliers and plush golden furniture.

Palatial: The house was in the village of Gorenichy and the ousted politician also had use of a hunting lodge . Plush: The home included a grand piano and lavish drapes. The top prosecutor's whereabouts are unknown . Bling: The living room included paintings, golden furnishings and opulent crystal chandeliers . Opulent to the extreme, the lavish estate was just one of several extravagant homes inhabited by the country's former leaders and top officials. The house in the village of Gorenichy outside Kiev was having its value assessed by experts after its owner went on the run. However, it was only one of Pshonka's homes. He also had the use of a hunting lodge around 20 miles away on a compound with two other lodges, one of them for the use of the deposed president Viktor Yanukovych. The hunting estate was also entered by opposition activists, who reportedly found guns and removed files. The scale of the opulence of homes used by public officials is seen by opposition activists as proof of large-scale corruption among the country's elite, one of the key causes of public anger which led to the protests in Kiev and other cities.","CCTV 'shows prosecutor Viktor Pshonka and tax chief Oleksandr Klimenko'

"Fears are growing that Greece will miss its deficit targets despite plans to axe 30,000 civil service jobs by the end of the year. The Greek cabinet today finalised details of drastic cuts aimed at saving £6.9billion so it can receive the final installment of its 2010 bail out. The FTSE 100 Index in London closed just over a percentage point down at 5,075.50, after a day of fluctuating above and below the 5000 mark, after Greece admitted it will miss its deficit reduction targets. That means London's blue-chip shares index has continued its dire performance after enduring its worst quarter in nine years, with about 14 per cent wiped off its value in the three months to the end of September. Greek Prime Minister, George Papandreou right, and the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al Thani, left, hold a press conference after a meeting in Athens. Qatar's sovereign wealth fund is investing £497million in Greece's flagship gold mining project . It was a similar story across world . markets today, with the Dax in Frankfurt also down following on from a poor performance in the Asian markets. The Greek government's admission that it will miss its tough deficit reduction targets cast fresh doubts as to whether it will be allowed the next tranche of its £94.4billion bailout. The debt-stricken country has previously warned that, if it does not receive the money, it could go bankrupt within weeks, which would cause financial chaos. Meanwhile, reports that Belgian bank Dexia is in need of a government bailout added to fears about the health of the banking sector. Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said Greece was  doing whatever it can to stave off bankruptcy and abide by the terms of the bailout package . As . the cost of insuring bank debts across the world rose to levels not . seen since the financial crisis, there is now speculation of another . credit crunch as confidence in lending dries up. Traders . are worried that political leaders do not seem to be able to tackle the . problems of high debt and slowing economic growth in many western . nations, which have plagued markets for months. The . Greek parliament meeting follows three days of talks with its creditors . - the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the . International Monetary Fund about a government proposal that the civil . service cuts will come mainly from placing staff nearing retirement age . on 'reserve,' or suspending them at reduced pay. State . workers who make up a fifth of the Greek workforce are guaranteed jobs . for life under a constitution that bans firing government employees in . virtually all circumstances. Under . the plan, the sacked workers workers would be put in the reserve by the . end of this year and paid 60 per cent of their salaries for a year, . after which they would be dismissed. The money at stake is the release of . £6.9billion - the sixth installment of a £94billion bailout package . agreed on in May last year, to save Greece from defaulting on its debt. Greece sees its 2011 budget deficit reaching 8.5 percent of GDP this year, missing a 7.6 percent target. The . 2012 budget draft foresees that the deficit will be brought down to 6.8 . percent of GDP next year, above a 6.5 percent target in the bailout . that saved Greece from bankruptcy. Speaking . to a Sunday newspaper, Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said that . Greece is doing whatever it can to stave off bankruptcy and abide by the . terms of the bailout package. He said he was confident that the disbursement of the sixth installment was certain. 'Since . we take such difficult decisions and the Greek people make such great . sacrifices, yes, the sixth installment is assured, Venizelos told . newspaper, To Vima.

"A group of Syrian Islamist militants posted a series of photographs of a man having his hand cut off in a live-update on Twitter. The live-feed of the amputation, which was carried out in the northern town of Maskanah, near Aleppo, was re-tweeted by several Jihadi social media channels. The group responsible, militant organisation ISIS - Islamist State in Iraq and Syria - claimed the man, an alleged thief, had requested to be punished in this way. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Horrific: This was the first in a series of gruesome images posted on Twitter from extremist group ISIS showing crowds watch an alleged thief have his hand cut off . Brutal: Militants held the alleged thief back as one advanced with a sword to chop his hand off . Several Jihadi accounts said the 'thief' had admitted his crimes 'and also asked that his hand be cut off to cleanse his sins'. It was not immediately possible to verify the accounts, and the photographs and tweets have now been removed from Twitter. One photo showed a blindfolded man with his hand being held down on a table while surrounded by a large group of militant rebels. A man dressed in a traditional white robe stands in front of the table, and on the right side is a man in a black balaclava holding a large sword. A later photo showed the man with his hand severed, the limb resting on the bloodied table. Graphic: The final image showed the man seemingly passed out after his hand had been severed . Live amputation: The group claimed the man had asked for the punishment to be carried out in Maskanah, near Aleppo in northern Syria, to 'cleanse him of sins' The Twitter account that posted the images has now been suspended from the social networking site. The punishment was inflicted by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), a pro-Al Qaeda Jihadist group that many fear is taking an iron grip over parts of Syria. The group was formed in April 2013 and grew out of Al Qaeda's affiliate organisation in Iraq, but it was formally disowned by the central organisation on February 3 for being too extreme. One of its leaders, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, has been deemed Middle East's most-wanted by the Iraqi interior ministry after a series of terrorist attacks which won him the moniker 'The Ghost'. Born from ISI (Islamic State in Iraq), it fought U.S. troops in the country before the end of the Iraq war in 2011. It has since become one of the main Jihadist groups fighting government forces in Syria and is mainly composed of foreign fighters. Ongoing battle: ISIS control a large proportion of northern Syria and is taking control of the previously disorganised rebel fighting groups as well as imposing Sharia law in the area (stock image) Though widely considered the most . radical group fighting President Bashar al-Assad, it is also engaged in a . violent struggle with rival Islamist rebels. ISIS controls much of rebel-held Syria in the north, including the town of Azaz, which was seized from the Western-backed Free Syrian Army (FSA) on 18 September. The city of Raqqa, with a community of Christians, was the first provincial capital to be occupied by the group last year. ISIS first formed during the Iraq war in 2004, comprised of numerous groups of the Sunni faith. It tried and failed to establish a Sunni state capital in the country, but held a strong presence in the most important battle grounds - including Baghdad and Salah ad Din - throughout the war. The extremist group is believed to be responsible for killing thousands of Iraqis, including members of the government. The group lost strength but by 2012 was gathering momentum after moving into Syria. Reports claim there are more than 2,500 ISIS members. On February 3, 2014, al Qaeda issued a formal statement distancing themselves from the group. Waging . war on Christianity, ISIS demanded any non-Muslims to pay a levy in . gold of 14g and curb displays of their faith or face death - although less than one per cent of Raqqa's 300,000 inhabitants are Christian. In a statement, the group claimed to . have met Christian leaders and offered them three choices: convert to . Islam, accept the conditions, or face death. It . stated: 'If they reject, they are subject to being legitimate targets, . and nothing will remain between them and ISIS other than the sword.' A group of 20 Christian leaders chose to accept the new rules, ISIS claim. Many Christians fled after ISIS started attacking and burning churches. Under a new set of brutal rules outlined by ISIS, they are banned from owning weapons and from selling pork or wine to Muslims or drinking wine in public. Punishments will also be issued to those who renovate churches, display crosses or other religious symbols, ring church bells or pray in public. It is believed ISIS is trying to implement an extreme interpretation of Islamic law. The group has been operating independently of other Jihadist groups such as the Nusra Front and has had a tense relationship with other rebels in Syria. In July, a commander of the FSA was reportedly shot dead by ISIS fighters in the coastal province of Lattakia. There were also reports of deadly clashes between the two groups in the north-western province of Idlib. Late last year, reports started to emerge of friction with other Islamists. In November 2013, ISIS was accused of killing a prominent member of the Syrian Islamist rebel group Ahrar al-Sham. In the most recent sign of continuing tension, ISIS suffered losses in two days of fighting against an alliance of other rebel forces in Aleppo and Idlib provinces. More than 2,000 people are believed to have been killed since Western-backed and Islamist groups attacked ISIS-occupied cities at the start of this year.","WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT: Islamist group live-tweeted punishment of a thief in northern Syria .

"The former head of the military, Lord Richards, pictured, has hit out at government defence cuts . The former head of the military has hit out at the government’s defence cuts, saying they could leave Britain with an army more suited to a ‘banana republic’. Lord Richards of Herstmonceux, who stood down last summer, said the reduced numbers of regular soldiers would be ‘a problem’ if the country was involved in another long-running conflict. In a separate swipe at defence secretary Philip Hammond, he said he respected him, but suggested he was not ‘clubbable’, and said that he would ‘never make a soldier’. And Lord Richards said he had disagreed with the strategy of cutting soldier numbers and relying increasingly on reservists - claiming he was not involved in the decision, which was taken out of his hands. Around 20,000 soldiers will be cut over the next four years in the largest redundancy programme ever attempted, coinciding with the end of Britain’s 13-year campaign in Afghanistan. But the peer - formerly General Sir David Richards – warned that a failure to retain quality people in the army, navy and air force would be disastrous for the long term future of the forces. ‘You will always have an army or armed forces. Every country does’, he said. ‘The difference between the British armed forces and those of most other countries, and I’ve come across many, is the quality of our people. We don’t pay them brilliantly by any means. Only now, when I’m outside, do I realise for the first time what people can be paid. ‘But because we look after them and because it’s socially at every level acceptable to be in the Army. Whether you are a private in the greenhouse from Yorkshire, or the heir to the throne, or you are a captain in some smart organisation, the fact is there is a consensus that it’s a good to be in the armed forces. ‘If you lose that because you don’t look after your people well, you will have an army, a navy and an air force, but it will be the sort of army, navy and air force with which we don’t associate with the British, that you associate with banana republics ultimately.’ Lord Richards said defence secretary Philip Hammond, pictured, would 'never make a soldier' Lord Richards commanded the armed forces in Afghanistan in 2006-7 and was made Chief of the Defence Staff in 2010. Cutting the numbers of soldiers to 82,000 meant on similar sustained campaigns ‘they yes, we would have a problem. Our regular soldiers would have to go back more frequently than is desirable.’ This would be a long-term problem, but by 2020, he said, ‘the British forces will look very impressive, will still be the second biggest spender in Nato and after the Americans we will be the most capable.’ While he added that he would always wonder if people would feel he let the forces down by allowing soldiers to be made redundant, he had felt it was crucial to get the economy back on track. As to relying on reservists, he said this decision was taken out of his chain of command, and he had argued for smaller cuts. In his maiden speech to the House of Lords this week, Lord Richards said Britain’s armed forced would need more resources to deal with the global threat of jihadis, and called for defence spending to increase as the economy starts to grow or the forces’ effectiveness ‘will inevitably deteriorate’.","Lord Richards of Herstmonceux has hit out at government's defence cuts .

"British actor and film director Richard Attenborough, who died at the age of 90 on Saturday, won the imagination of millions over his 60-year career on the screen. In the early years he was best known for his roles in Brighton Rock and The Great Escape, and later for his behind-the-scenes part as director and producer of Gandhi, which won him critical acclaim for his 'typically sympathetic and sure-handed' direction of the movie. Meanwhile his role as the 'best Santa ever', according to his co-star Dylan McDermott in the remake of Miracle on 34th Street in 1994, moved a generation of children born in the Eighties. And in his part as the eccentric millionaire in Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park in 1993 and later in the 1997 sequel, Lord Attenborough continued to win the hearts and minds of cinema-goers. 1. Jurassic Park . Attenborough became a cult figure for youngsters in the 1994 film and 1997 sequel with his role as John Hammond, a sympathetic grandfather who builds a dream-come-true dinosaur park. Welcome to Jurassic Park: Many people know him as the eccentric millionaire and sympathetic grandfather, John Hammond, in Steven Spielberg's dinosaur blockbuster . 2. Gandhi . Produced and directed by Attenborough, the 1982 film looks back on the leader of India's independence movement against the UK's rule of the country during the 20th century. The biographical movie bagged eight Academy awards - a record for British film - including best director. 3. Brighton Rock . Attenborough first appeared on the screen in this 1947 film as psychopathic gangster Pinkie Brown. It was a role that cast him as a hoodlum for the next few years until he moved on to play more sympathetic characters. Merry Christmas: Richard Attenborough won the imaginations of New Yorkers in the 1994 remake of Miracle on 34th Street in his role as Santa Claus . 4. Miracle On 34th Street . Attenborough's brilliant performance convinces the children of New York that he is Santa Claus. But when he ends up in court, his trademark twinkle and white beard doesn't cut the mustard and he relies on help from six-year-old Susan to prove he's the real deal in this 1994 remake. 5. The Great Escape . During the Sixties, Attenborough showed a fondness for military roles, playing the POW mastermind Bartlett in The Great Escape in 1963. He later went on to play the ship's engineer Frenchy Burgoyne in The Sand Pebbles in 1966 and Sergeant Major Lauderdale in Guns at Batasi in 1964.","British actor died on Saturday leaving a 60-year cinema legacy behind .

"President Obama has sent  a special unit of CIA officers to the UK to investigate British Muslim extremists amid growing fears in Washington that we are becoming a ‘breeding ground’ for terrorism. In a pointed snub to MI5, the agents arrived on a ‘lone wolf’ mission to interrogate senior security experts about the radicalisation of UK Muslims. The mission has been revealed as our security services have been forced to admit they are struggling to keep track of the estimated 500 Britons who have travelled to the Middle East to fight alongside the Islamic  Isis forces in Syria and Iraq. Snub: Barack Obama has sent a special unit of CIA officers to the UK to investigate British Muslim extremists . It is unusual for the CIA to send a team to the UK: the agency usually relies on information passed to it by  MI5 or MI6 or by its agents stationed at the American Embassy in London. Sources have told The Mail on Sunday that the agents were keen to establish the ‘stability’ of the relationship between the Sunni and Shia branches of Muslims in the UK. The fighters going out to join Isis have been British-based Sunnis, causing deepening tensions within the community. Professor Anthony Glees, of the Centre for Security and Intelligence Studies at Buckingham University, said the mission, which took place earlier this year, showed the level of concern in Washington over the issue, which he claimed was rooted in the UK’s ‘lax’ immigration policies. ‘The US is worried about the British situation. They fear there might be a knock-on effect for them,’ Prof Glees said. ‘The throat-cutting between Sunnis and Shias in Iraq and Syria has not yet spread to the UK, but it is a real threat. It is conceivable you could see Shia “hit squads” in Britain targeting Sunnis preparing to go out to the conflict zones to fight.’ He said: ‘The Americans regard the UK as a disaster because of our lax stance on immigration which has allowed this militancy to take hold. Radicalised: Former promising Cardiff students Reyaad Khan (left) and Nasser Muthana (right) in an Isis video . ‘Frankly, they would not be doing their jobs properly if it did not do this – forming an objective view of the situation outside of the reports they get from MI5 and their officers at the US Embassy in London.’ Last night a source at the CIA insisted British intelligence had been informed of ‘all outside contacts’ the agents made in  the UK. However, the sources also admitted that the move revealed a growing lack of trust in Washington over MI5 and MI6’s ability to provide a reliable assessment of the security threat presented by young Muslims under the sway of imams who are radicalised and then recruited to fight in religious wars around the globe. The Obama administration has become increasingly anxious that young American Muslims could follow the same pattern. There are strong links between British and American radicals and the sources say the CIA feels British efforts to identify and unmask them have been inadequate. A CIA and a Home Office spokesman declined to comment.","Sources said U.S. agents want to assess stability of Muslim relations in UK .

"These amazing photographs bring a new meaning to the word car-nage. A furious brown bear is believed to have staged this stunning revenge attack on the car of a hunter who shot and wounded it in the leg. The unnamed huntsman and two friends were in the Siberian forest when the beast surprised them. Scroll down for video . Car-nage: A furious brown bear is believed to have staged this stunning revenge attack on the car of a hunter ... after he shot and wounded the animal in the thigh . Bear-faced cheek: The hunter shot the wild brown bear in the thigh forcing it to flee, but next day when he returned to his Ford car, he realised his prey had had the last laugh, and ripped his vehicle to pieces . Was it a bear? Claw marks and footprints were visible in the wet clay at the scene, as if the creature had left his calling card . The hunter shot the wild brown bear in the thigh forcing it to flee, but the next day when he returned to his Ford, he realised his prey had had the last laugh, and ripped his car to pieces. 'The animal ran amok: It scratched the Ford's body, broke the lights, smashed the windscreen, tore the front and rear seats, and ripped off the rear bumper,' reported The Siberian Times. 'The owner shook his head in disbelief.' The most surprising fact about the onslaught was that the vehicles belonging to the hunter's friends were completely untouched. Baffling: The men concluded that the bear has used his acute sense of smell to locate the car of the man who had left him crippled, and wreaked his vengeance. But it left the hunter's friends' cars completely untouched . Big squeeze: The beast apparently even managed to get inside the car in the attack . 'That must have been a busy night for the bear, he worked hard,' said the hunter's astonished friend. 'You must have had something sweet inside the car.' Shocked, the hunter replies: 'No, I didn't.' The men concluded that the bear has used his acute sense of smell to locate the car of the man who had left him crippled, and wreaked his vengeance. Nor was there any doubt that the attack was by a bear. Claw marks and footprints were visible in the wet clay at the scene, as if the creature had left his calling card. 'That must have been a busy night for the bear, he worked hard,' said the hunter's astonished friend. 'You must have had something sweet inside the car' 'The next dilemma for the shocked hunter: what to tell his insurance company? 'Do they cover revenge attacks by wounded bears?', asked the English language website. Siberian bears tend to be much bolder toward humans than their shyer, more persecuted European counterparts. Siberian bears regularly destroy hunters’ storages and huts where they think there is food. They are also more carnivorous than those in Europe too, hunting mountain hares, reindeer, wapiti or moose by ambushing them from pine trees. They do not, however, seem to like honey.","The astonishing revenge attack apparently took place in a forest in Siberia .

"French Interior Minister Manuel Valls publically dressed down U.S. Ambassador Charles Rivkin during a July 4 garden party . A French minister has publicly dressed down the United States during the American ambassador's July 4 garden party. French Interior Minister Manuel Valls denounced the U.S. 'espionage' of France and other countries. Valls was guest of honor at the fete hosted by Ambassador Charles Rivkin in Paris today. In a speech before hundreds of guests, he said that 'in the name of our friendship, we owe each other honesty. We must say things clearly, directly, frankly.' He said that President Francois Hollande's demand for clear and precise explanations about reports of U.S. spying are justified because 'such practices, if proven, do not have their place between allies and partners.' European countries agreed yesterday that planned talks on free trade with the U.S. must start in parallel with discussions on National Security Agency surveillance. The speech comes after revelations that French security agents regularly spy illegally on people's phone calls, emails, and social media activity, intelligence sources confirmed today. Revelations about the covert activities follow President Francois Hollande attacking America for its own espionage activities, and saying they should stop 'immediately'. Le Monde, the most famous and best respected newspaper in France, today carries a detailed report outlining the behaviour of the DGSE, the country's notoriously ruthless external intelligence agency. It says the DGSE intercepts signals from computers and telephones - including foreign ones - to work out 'who is talking to whom'. Such activity boils down to wiretapping, even though this is officially strictly forbidden following a number of scandals in the past. 'All of our communications are spied on,' says Le Monde's report, quoting unnamed intelligence sources, as well as remarks made publicly by intelligence officials. 'Emails, text messages, telephone records, access to Facebook and Twitter are then stored for years,' it says. Tensions between France and the U.S. have been strained since former NSA worker Edward Snowden leaked documents suggesting America regularly spied on its European allies . Such activities are just like those . carried out by the U.S. National Security Agency, as described in . documents leaked by former NSA worker Edward Snowden. He . confirmed that the NSA keeps vast amounts of Internet data under a . programme called Prism. It includes emails, chat room conversations and . videos taken from sites run by giants like Facebook and Google. The . U.S. government also gathers so-called 'metadata', noting the time, . duration and numbers called - all listed by service providers like . Verizon. France's DGSE has publicly always insisted that it works within the law, but its past activities have included the sinking of the Rainbow Warrior ecological protest boat in 1985. The operation against the Greenpeace craft - which caused the death of a Dutch activist - violated New Zealand neutrality and caused international outrage. French security agents regularly spy illegally on phone calls, according to reports, which will embarrass President Francois Hollande, who has vocally criticsied the U.S. It was ordered by former Socialist president Francois Mitterand, who was himself linked with an illegal wiretapping cell within France itself. But France's national security commission has challenged Le Monde's report, saying that the only body that collects communications information was a security agency controlled by the prime minister's office. Earlier this week, President Hollande threatened to block negotiations on transatlantic trade following revelations that the US spied on its allies. 'We cannot accept this kind of behaviour between partners and allies,' Mr Hollande said. 'We ask that this immediately stop. There can be no negotiations or transactions in all areas until we have obtained these guarantees, for France but also for all of the European Union, for all partners of the United States.' The DGSE revelations will now leave Mr Hollande looking, at best, incredibly naieve, and at worst extremely hypocritical. France's seven other intelligence services, including domestic secret services and customs and money-laundering watchdogs, have access to the DGSE data, writes Le Monde . Britain is said to have a similar spying programme on international phone and Internet traffic, and is said to share personal information with the American NSA. A spokesman for the DGSE in Paris refused to comment directly on Le Monde's report.","Manual Valls was guest of honor at Ambassador Charles Rivkin's party .

"Seeing some of the world's most majestic creatures in their natural African habitat is always a momentous occasion. But, as these beautiful pictures show, watching them in their element during the twilight hours is all the more spectacular. Photographer Andrew Schoeman, 40, captured these stunning images of mammals and birds prowling the wilds of South Africa but appearing as silhouettes against the contrasting background of the setting and rising sun. His vivid images show everything from an imposing alpha male lion and hefty elephants to tiny bee-eating birds and Cape Turtle doves. The Lion King: Photographer Andrew Schoeman captured this striking image of an alpha male lion prowling across the wild fields of South Africa . Land of the rising sun: A yellow billed stork at sunrise can be seen flying across the African plains as the sky lightens up behind . Mr Schoeman, who works as a freelance photographic guide on safari, took the shots at sunrise and sunset. They include a herd of elephants fresh from swimming across a river or enjoying a dust bath and a giraffe appearing to dwarf the bright sun. Mr Schoeman, from Nelspruit, said: 'I love the colour in the images. A lot of photographers only want sunlight but I feel there are many opportunities after the sun has set or the light has gone. Born to be wild: Silhouettes of elephants as they march across the African terrain near the Chobe river in Botswana . On the prowl: Photographer Andrew Schoeman captured these two Cheetahs as the sun begins to set in the horizon . 'For me a silhouette tells a story and there is something special about capturing the moment in time just before the sun has gone but there are still great colours in the sky. 'I need to be very accurate with my exposures otherwise I can lose the colour in the sky and I enjoy the challenge of getting the exposure right and still having a sharply focused image and a nice composition. 'The light fades very fast at sunset and it gets bright very quickly at sunrise so the window of opportunity is very small - but I love the challenge.' Love birds: Two doves can be seen perched on a branch as the sun rises in the background . Dwarfing the sun: A giraffe appears to tower over the sun as it sets, pictured left, and a Fish Eagle looks content watch the evening descend, pictured right . Mr Schoeman photographed the giraffe and African Fish Eagle from a boat in the Chobe river, Botswana. And the elephants were taken soon after they had stopped at the water's edge to drink. Mr Schoeman said: 'A few of the elephants had a bit of a dust bath on their way back to the woodland, creating this beautiful moment. 'It was dry and dusty and I love the way the colour, the dust and the silhouettes of the 'ellies' combine. This family scene is one of my best images.' A cheetah is pictured sniffing the ground as clouds slowly disperse on a cool morning, allowing rays of sunlight to break through. Lone ranger: This elephant appears to have broken away from its herd in this image taken by photographer Andrew Schoeman . Early riser: This silhouette shows a Cheetah waking up as the clouds start to disperse to reveal rays of sunshine on a cool morning . The Carmine Bee eaters were spotted at a nesting colony home to thousands of birds, flying around and squawking. Mr Schoeman saw the lion on a chilly, cloudy morning. He said: 'We were on a drive and saw this lion with the amazing sun and clouds behind him. 'We got into position a few minutes before he got up and I was able to capture this image of him. I think the sun and cloud in the sky look brilliant, with him lifting his paw in the air. 'I love the fact that it is a powerful animal with a beautiful sunrise, the colours in the sky are great.'

"A rogue monk who shunned his Buddhist vows in favor of private jets, expensive cars and Louis Vuitton luggage is now wanted by Thai police for rape. Luang Pu Nenkham, better known as the 'jet-set monk,' gained notority when a viral video appeared on YouTube two months ago showing him accessorizing his traditional dress with golden Aviator sunglasses and a Louis Vuitton bag aboard a private jet. Thailand's Department of Special Investigation have now uncovered a mind-boggling list of assets belonging to the 34-year old, who claimed to be the reincarnation of a respected monk who lived several decades ago, including at least 83 cars, a long list of properties and millions upon millions of dollars. Scroll down to watch video . High flyer: One of the Buddhist monks featured in the YouTube cilip, Luang Pu Nenkham Chattigo, has been accused of being married, and a fake . The lavish lifestyle is believed to . have been funded by donations over the past decade, from poor supporters . as well as rich donors. On Wednesday, Thai authorities issued an arrest . warrant for the monk who has now stripped of his religious leadership, . and according to CNN, rape is among the charges he is facing. Nenkham, who also goes by the name . Weerapol Sukpol, also faces charges of violating Thailand's computer . crime act by posting 'deceitful information' and having sex with a . minor, authorities told CNN. A . female plaintiff claimed Nenkham had sex with her when she was just 14 . years old. She has submitted a request for a DNA test for her 11-year . old son, Tharit Pengdit, Director General of the Department of Special . Investigation, told the station. The results are still pending. Nenkham's . bank accounts are also under investigation after at least 300 million . baht, or nearly $10 million, disappeared from the former holy man's . accounts in recent days. Under investigation: The video clip received complaints from Buddhists across the globe, prompting a probe into the monks' behaviour . A source told the DSI that the jet-set monk is in the United States, holed . up at a Buddhist retreat he owns some 75 miles south of Los Angeles. On . Thursday, CNN went to the retreat but one resident monk said Nenkham . had not been seen at the property in three months while a second said . he'd been gone for a year. In . an effort to catch the fugitive, Thailand's DSI told CNN it has . requested 114 financial institutions, land and transport departments to . seize all of his assets. Authorities from the south east Asian country . have also requested U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement revoke . Nenkham's visa and, if they catch him, will ask U.S. authorities to . arrest and remand him into Thai custody. The monk provoked outrage when he was filmed carrying a designer Louis Vuitton bag while on board a private jet. Nenkham attracted global attention when the video clip of him was posted on YouTube, with his high-flying image starkly at odds with the quiet life of reflection and meditative study synonymous with his religion. He has been accused of being married, and having relationships with seven other women in a probe by Thailand's Department of Special Investigations. Shocking behaviour: The allegations surrounding Pu Nenkham have shocked Thailand, which is home to the world's largest Buddhist population . According to the department, Nenkham, . who is abbot of the Khantitham Forest Monastery in north eastern . Thailand, is allegedly married to a woman called Yupinpraethong . Janthawa. He has also been . accused by a fellow monk of being a fake, and wearing the religious . robes despite not being entitled to do so - a criminal offense in Thailand. Luang Pu Buddha Isara, the abbot at another monastery, filed the complaint against Nenkham  to Bangkok's Criminal Court. The allegations surrounding Nenkham have shocked Thailand, which is home to the largest number of Buddhists in the world. He is now being investigated by the Department of Special Investigations, and the Office of National Buddhism, which monitors the 200,000 monks in Thailand, according to the Daily Telegraph. The investigation was launched following numerous complaints from Buddhists around the world after the two minute and 47 second long clip was posted on YouTube. The video showed monks, one of them Nenkham, sporting fashionable mirrored shades and using wireless headphones on board the private plane. Accused: Pu Nenkham, who is abbot of the Khantitham Forest Monastery in north eastern Thailand, is allegedly married to a woman called Yupinpraethong Janthawa . The clip also prompted the Office of National Buddhism's . director-general Nopparat Benjawatananun to warn the monks not to repeat the lavish behavior, and there are plans for the watchdog to begin monitoring monks across Thailand. Nenkham . is also the focus of a money-laundering investigation, with a police . colonel, Pong-in Intarakhao claiming that the abbot, along with others, . had 41 bank accounts filled with cash from public donations to his monastery, with the accounts mostly in his name. The abbot was initially believed to be in Europe, and was been ordered to return to his home country within the next 30 days by  Mr Benjawatananun. But it is now thought he is in America. Thailand has attempted to help . Buddha's 2,600-year-old doctrine stand the test of time through a . variety of means, including imposing a ban on the sale of alcohol on . religious holidays. The efforts, however, are sometimes tainted by the monks themselves. Last . year, about 300 out of 61,416 Buddhist monks and novices in Thailand . were reprimanded - in several cases removed from the monkhood - because . of their misconduct, ranging from alcohol consumption, having sex with . women, to extortion. Under suspicion: He has also been accused of being a fake, and wearing the religious robes despite not being entitled to do so - a criminal offence in Thailand . The office also received complaints about monks driving cars, and scams and false claims of black magic uses by monks. Mr Nopparat has said the monks . in the video were acting 'inappropriately, not composed and not adhering . to Buddha's teachings of simplicity and self-restraint'. Monruedee . Bantoengsuk, an administrative officer at Khantitham Temple in Sisaket . province, confirmed that the monks on the private plane lived at the . temple but refused to give details about the trip. The . images from the video contrasted with the abbot's message on the . temple's homepage that read: 'The true core of those who preach Buddha's . teachings is to not to own any objects at all'. Mr Nopparat said: 'When . Lord Buddha was alive, there wasn't anything like this. There were no . cars, smart phones or cameras, so the rules were much simpler. 'While the . monks need to keep themselves abreast of new knowledge, current events . and technology, they are restrained to choose the appropriate tools.' He said one way to prevent the monks from misbehaving is for followers not to spoil them with valuable objects or vices. 'In . many cases, it was the followers who gave the monks the luxury. Some . bought them sports cars. This is by no means necessary.'

"Florida Senator Marco Rubio admonished president Barack Obama today for going behind Congress's back to get missing soldier Bowe Bergdahl released. Rubio said Obama 'didn't follow the law' when he unilaterally made the decision to release five Guantanamo Bay detainees with ties to the Taliban in exchange for Sgt. Bergdahl. 'We have a law in this country, it says you have to notify [Congress] within in 30 days,' Rubio, a Republican on the Senate's Select Committee on Intelligence, told MailOnline. 'He completely ignored it. He's gone rogue.' Sen. Marco Rubio, pictured here at a rally for Republican senatorial candidate Joni Ernst in Urbandale, Iowa, told MailOnline on Tuesday that Obama 'ignored' the law when he went around Congress to negotiate Bergdahl's release . The National Defense Authorization Act requires the executive branch to give Congress 30 days notice before it frees prisoners from Guantanamo Bay. In the case of the Bergdahl trade, members of Congress received notice just hours before the deal was to occur. President Obama tried to play down the significance of his administration's actions today, saying at a press conference in Warsaw, Poland, this morning that Congress  knew his office was considering a trade for 'quite some time' before it happened. Members of Congress dispute that claim. 'I don’t know what he means by consulted Congress for some time,' House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, a Republican, told MSNBC this morning. 'In 2011, they did come up and . present a plan that included a prisoner transfer that was, in a . bipartisan way, pushed back. 'We hadn’t heard anything since on any . details of any prisoner exchange,' he said. House Speaker John Boehner backed up his colleague's timeline of events this afternoon, saying in a statement that more than two years ago the administration had a discussion with members of Congress about a trade, but 'the administration deferred further engagement because the prospects of the exchange had diminished.' 'The administration provided assurances, publicly reiterated by the White House in June 2013, that its engagement with Congress would resume if the prospects for an exchange became credible again,' Boehner said, adding that 'the only reason it did not is because the administration knew it faced serious and sober bipartisan concern and opposition.' Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman . Dianne Feinstein offered reporters a similar version of events, saying that when the administration approached the House and Senate Intelligence Committees in 2011 'there were very strong views and they were virtually unanimous against the trade.' 'The notification to us is important and I think that it would have . been a much better thing to do because you do try to work together,' Feinstein said. Feinstein said Deputy National . Security Adviser Tony Blinken called her last night to beg pardon for not notifying her of the trade sooner. 'He apologized and said it was an oversight,' the Democratic senator said after her party's weekly policy luncheon. 'The notification to us is important and I think that it would have been a much better thing to do because you do try to work together,' Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein told reporters today after the Democratic Party's policy luncheon . Administration officials say the White . House kept the swap secret to ensure Bergdahl's safety, but Republicans . are questioning the accuracy of that claim. 'The administration has invited serious questions into how this . exchange went down and the calculations the White House and relevant . agencies made in moving forward without consulting Congress despite . assurances it would re-engage with members on both sides of the aisle,' Speaker Boehner said today.

It's a near certainty that Obama knew about the swap when he secretly had former Secretary of State and presumed 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton over for lunch two days before Bergdahl's release. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham told The Hill it would be 'fair game' to ask Clinton if she did indeed know about the trade before it took place. 'This has ramifications long term for the U.S., this prisoner swap,' he said. 'If Mrs. Clinton remains politically active, people will want to know what her advice was on the subject,' Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, who sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee, told The Hill. If Obama did tell Clinton, 'it would be outrageous that he . notified someone who's outside government before he would even notify . members of Congress, including the Chairwoman of the Intelligence . committee, for example, or the Speaker of the House, for that matter,' Rubio told MailOnline. A spokesman for the National Security Council wouldn't tell The Hill what Obama and Clinton discussed at lunch,and Clinton's spokesman ignored reporters' requests for comment on Bergdahl today. Asked at a lecture about Bergdahl yesterday, Clinton said Obama faced a 'tough' decision and its one she dares not question. 'I don't believe in second guessing people who have to make these hard choices,' Clinton said.","Lawmakers are upset with President Barack Obama for going around their back to get Sgt.

"A bungling thief was arrested for robbery after she went back to the shop she had raided to pick up a mobile phone she had dropped. Amanda McGorian claimed she had a gun and demanded cash from two women workers at the Spar on Chester Road in Sunderland. But Newcastle Crown Court heard the 27-year-old dropped her mobile phone while escaping with money from the till during the raid on September 29. Amanda McGorian claimed she had a gun and demanded cash from two women workers at the Spar on Chester Road in Sunderland . She returned 15 minutes later and asked officers at the scene: 'Can I just get my phone and say sorry to the lasses.' McGorian, of Penshaw, was arrested and admitted robbery. Judge James Goss QC told her: 'Not only did you cause considerable fear to the young girls who were looking after that shop, performing a public service, but you did your level best to get yourself locked up by doing that. 'You didn’t have a gun but they weren’t to know that and you can imagine they would be frightened by you making that threat in the circumstances. 'It was a drunken, stupid criminal act on your part and I hope you realise that now.' The court heard one of the workers, who was 21, had been employed at the store for just two weeks when McGorian went in an and demanded cash. But Newcastle Crown Court (pictured) heard the 27-year-old dropped her mobile phone while escaping with money from the till during the raid on September 29 . After making repeated requests for money, McGorian said: 'Do I have to get my f****** gun out.' Prosecutor John Brennan told the court: 'That changed the whole atmosphere and they were frightened whether she had a weapon or not.' The newly hired worker said she was unsure if she could ever go back to work in the shop and said she had burst into tears after the raid. Christopher Rose, defending, said alcohol is at the root of McGorian’s problems. Mr Rose said: 'She needs some supervision. 'She realises the need to change.' McGorian was sentenced to eight months behind bars, suspended for two years, with supervision, alcohol treatment programme requirement and a three month night time curfew. The judge told her: 'You have been given a chance. You won't get another chance.'","Amanda McGorian claimed she had a gun and demanded cash from till .

"A company in South Africa is offering to install microchips in tombstones to detect if they're being stolen. Memorial Alert is a transmitter placed inside a headstone which will sound an alarm and send out texts to relatives of the deceased if it detects that a grave is being tampered with. Up to 20 marble and granite tombstones a month are stolen from graves in Johannesburg's 36 cemeteries before being sold on to crooked stonemasons. A company in South Africa is offering to install a sensor into people's gravestone to stop them being stolen . The graveyards are already patrolled by security staff and have perimeter fences, but this has not stopped the criminals. Mark Pringle, director Chaldean Trading 9 Ltd, the company developing the technology, said any tampering would set off a loud alarm in the cemetery. If it is disturbed then a loud alarm will sound in the cemetery and text alerts will be send to the memorial's owners . He added: 'This in itself should be a fair warning to the perpetrators. Then text messages are sent to the mobile phones of delegated family members and any integrated security companies.' Microchips have already been installed in most graves in the city to help relatives find their loved one's resting place in the large, grassy graveyards. Pringle said that the company had considered putting a tacking device into the transmitter, but that it would reduce the battery life and cost too much. He said it would be unlikely that it would be needed as the stones were heavy and difficult to move, and the alarm would be enough of a deterrent. Alan Buff, the manager of Johannesburg City parks, cemeteries and crematoriums, said: 'This is peace of mind for the family. 'Tombstones are the property of the owner which is the family member, and you'll find you cannot insure a tombstone or it's too expensive for many. By doing this, it is insured.' The company has a patent in both South Africa and Britain hopes that the technology will spread to other countries after it is trialled in Johannesburg. The alarm will launch in South Africa in January, though a price hasn't been set yet. A transmitter will be placed inside the gravestone and will trigger an alarm to sound if it is being tampered with. The system will also send text alerts to people's families .","Memorial Alert is a transmitter installed inside a headstone .
