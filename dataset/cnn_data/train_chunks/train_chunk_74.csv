"(CNN) -- Lionel Messi scored a superb late goal to give Argentina a 1-0 victory over South American rivals Brazil in a prestige friendly international in Qatar on Wednesday. The world player of the year struck in time added on to give Argentina a first win in five years against the five-time world champions, who they will meet again in La Plata on December 19. The diminutive Barcelona gathered a pass from substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi and waltzed in from the right flank past four defenders before angling a low left-foot shot into the corner of the net. It was Messi's first goal against Brazil, who recalled Ronaldinho for the first time since April 2009. ""It's always important to win and this victory is even more important because it's against a direct rival and it gives us confidence,"" Messi told AFP. ""My goal was important because it enabled us to beat Brazil."" It was Brazil's first defeat in four matches under new coach Mano Menezes, who replaced Dunga after the team lost in the quarterfinals of the 2010 World Cup. Sergio Batista, however, triumphed in his first match as fulltime Argentina coach as his side bounced back from the 1-0 defeat by Japan while he was still in temporary charge. Brazil's Dani Alves hit the crossbar in the first half, while Messi fired a shot which grazed the woodwork. The United States beat 2010 World Cup hosts South Africa 1-0 in Cape Town thanks to a late goal from teenage debutant Juan Agudelo. The Colombia-born forward, who turns 18 next week, scored the only goal with five minutes to play after being set up by fellow newcomer Mikkel Diskerud -- a 20-year-old Norwegian midfielder whose mother is from Arizona. It was South Africa's first defeat in four matches since the World Cup, with England-based striker David Somma -- who lived in the U.S. in his early teens -- making his debut for Bafana Bafana. Paraguay romped to a 7-0 win away to Hong Kong, with striker Roque Santa Cruz scoring twice in the first half and Jose Ortigoza netting twice in the second. Edgar Barreto, Marcos Riveros and Cristian Riveros were also on target for the World Cup quarterfinalists. African champions Egypt crushed Australia 3-0 in Cairo, with first-half goals from Ahmed Abd El-Zaher and Gedo before Mohamed Zidan scored a last-minute penalty. The Ivory Coast lost 3-1 to Poland in Poznan as young striker Robert Lewandowski scored twice for the home side. Gervinho equalized just before halftime but Ludovic Obraniak put Poland ahead again on 64 before the 22-year-old Lewandowski struck for his second with 10 minutes to play. Morocco drew 1-1 with Northern Ireland in Belfast as striker Marouane Chamakh scored an opportunist opener in the 56th minute before Rory Patterson leveled with a penalty with four minutes left. In other games involving African teams, Malawi beat Rwanda 2-1, Ghana drew 0-0 away to Saudi Arabia, Mali defeated the visiting Congo Republic 3-1, Senegal beat Gabon 2-1 and Algeria drew 0-0 with Luxembourg. China defeated European minnows Latvia 1-0 in Kunming thanks to a header in time added on from substitute Yang Xu. Oman crashed to a 4-0 home defeat by Belarus, for whom defender Alyaksandr Martynovich scored twice in the first 11 minutes. Kuwait were held 1-1 at home by Asian champions Iraq.","Argentina beat Brazil for the first time in five years in friendly international in Doha .

"Chicago (CNN) -- A fire that killed two Chicago firefighters and injured 17 earlier this week grew from wood or trash burning in the ""rear portion of the building,"" the fire department said Friday. An ""open-flame ignition of ordinary combustibles,"" such as wood or rubbish, led to Wednesday's blaze, Chicago Fire Department spokesman Larry Langford said in a news release. There had not been any gas or electric service in the abandoned building -- located on the city's south side -- for months, he added. The Chicago police department has opened a criminal investigation into the fire, Langford said. On Wednesday, Fire Commissioner Robert Hoff said the building was boarded up in the front but the back was open, leading firefighters to think that homeless people may have sought shelter there. The casualties came after a wall and roof of the commercial building, which is on East 75th Street, collapsed without warning. Hoff told reporters Wednesday afternoon that none of the injuries was life-threatening. At that time, one firefighter was in stable condition, he said. The commissioner identified those killed as Corey Ankum, who had been with the department less than two years, and 12-year veteran Edward Stringer. Both were inside the structure. Other firefighters were working the blaze from the roof. CNN affiliate WGN aired footage of a line of firefighters saluting one body as it arrived at the medical examiner's office later Wednesday. Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley issued a statement saying, ""The deaths of Firefighters Stringer and Ankum are both a sad reminder of how much gratitude we owe our first responders and a tragedy for all Chicagoans."" The deaths came on the 100th anniversary of the Chicago Stockyards fire, which killed 21 firefighters and the city fire marshal. The fire was reported shortly before 7 a.m. in the office area of the building, Langford said. The routine fire call became a multiple-alarm blaze after part of the roof collapsed as firefighters were inside, he said. Ankum, Stringer and two other firefighters were trapped by the collapse. The commissioner said Wednesday that investigators will look at whether ice or weather was a factor, as well as the age of the building and its heavy roof. ""There are things that happen when buildings are aged, and that could have been one of the contributing factors in this case,"" Hoff said. Langford said it was his understanding that both of the fallen firefighters had children. While the loss of a firefighter is always a tragedy, he said, ""it's been compounded"" by the deaths occurring so close to the holidays. CNN's Sara Pratley contributed to this report.","NEW: Chicago's fire department says the fire started at the back of the building .

"(CNN) -- Fears of a serial killer stalking women in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, have prompted some residents to take matters into their own hands -- and onto the internet, with frightful results for one man. Many residents of the city have joined a Facebook page titled ""Catch the Kensington Strangler, before he catches someone you love,"" and police say a male Philadelphia resident was falsely accused of being responsible for three strangulation murders and three other assaults that have occurred in the central Philadelphia area in recent weeks. The post contained a photograph of the man and listed his address and contact information, police spokesman Lt. Ray Evers told CNN. Shortly after the posting, a group of people began gathering outside the man's home, prompting him to call the police, according to Evers. ""He probably feared for his life."" Evers said. Police later escorted the man to the city's special victims unit, where he was interviewed and his DNA was compared with samples taken from the scene of the three killings that all came from the same individual. The man's DNA didn't match the DNA from the crime scenes, and he was cleared. Police said they are unsure who made the accusation, but they believe whoever did it had a vendetta against the man and could face charges if caught. Authorities are warning female residents not to walk alone, as police and community watch groups continue to search for the killer. ""The task force we've put together is sweeping the area, but we caution females in the area not go it alone at any cost,"" Evers said. On Tuesday night, police announced they are looking for a serial killer after it was determined that DNA found at the scene of the third homicide matched that found at two previous killings. The partially clothed body of the third victim, Casey Mahoney, 27, was discovered December 15, according to police spokeswoman Jillian Russell. Mahoney had been sexually assaulted and strangled. Two other women, Elaine Goldberg, 21, and Nicole Piacentini, 35, were killed in November. Police originally told CNN that all of the homicide victims were involved in prostitution and narcotics, but a Philadelphia TV station, WCAU-TV, has reported that Goldberg was a nursing student who attended Gwynedd-Mercy College. Authorities are offering a $30,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction, said task force Capt. James Clark. Earlier this week, authorities said they believe the attacker likely is still within a 10-block radius of where the attacks occurred. Police said the assault victims described the attacker as an African-American male in his early 20s, weighing between 160 and 170 pounds. Authorities say they lack DNA evidence that would link the three assaults, in which the victims were choked in a manner similar to the homicide victims. Too much time had elapsed between the initial two assaults in October and the victims' notifying police. ""The assault victims did not come forward until police began combing the Kensington (neighborhood) for suspects and potential victims following the November homicides,"" Evers said. Federal agents joined the investigation earlier this month, bringing in resources from the FBI's behavioral analysis unit, violent criminal apprehension program, and the National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime. ""The investigation appears to be limited to Philadelphia,"" FBI spokesman J.J. Klaver said this week. ""This could change if there are any indications that the subject or subjects responsible for the crimes ... are linked to similar crimes elsewhere."" Police have said the assault victims described the attacker as an African-American male in his early 20s, weighing between 160 and 170 pounds. Police said a third assault victim was pulled into an alley earlier this month. Despite being choked, punched and hit on the head with a brick, the 33-year-old woman escaped, and her assailant fled the scene, according to a police report.","Post on a Facebook page falsely accused a Philadelphia man of serial killings .

"Morgantown, West Virginia (CNN) -- Wealthy Republican businessman John Raese has run three times for statewide office in West Virginia over the past few decades and has never won. It wasn't that long ago that most political observers here and in Washington thought his fourth campaign would be a losing battle too -- a Senate race against popular Democratic Gov. Joe Manchin. But now, several public surveys as well as parties' private polls show Raese within striking distance of snatching the seat of the late Sen. Robert Byrd from Democratic hands. In interview at his campaign headquarters, Raese, who joked that the Tea Party is to the left of him, said he believes voters are now more open to his anti-government views. ""I've been a conservative in West Virginia before that was popular,"" said Raese. ""I've seen a change in West Virginia."" Raese's leading argument to voters fits neatly on a bumper sticker his campaign is distributing: ""No rubber stamps."" In television and radio ads, and on the campaign trail, Raese is pounding Manchin -- warning voters he would be a ""rubber stamp"" for President Obama and the Democratic-controlled Congress. Those are stinging accusations in a conservative state that voted decisively for John McCain over Obama, and where the president's approval rating is extremely low. Still, in any other election year, those charges might not resonate against Manchin, who is incredibly popular in West Virginia. But Democratic strategists say their internal polling and focus groups show that tying Manchin to Obama, Democratic congressional leaders and their policies is dragging him down. It could be heard in Milton, West Virginia, along the Pumpkin Festival parade route. ""I think he's doing a great job here and I voted for him both times he's run here in West Virginia,"" said Dave Ridel, who had just waved to the governor going by, ""but going to Washington, it scares me to death that he's just going to be a rubber stamp."" It's a dichotomy that speaks volumes about the frustration voters have with Washington. Manchin says he knows it's a challenge for him. ""Yeah, they're mad."" he said in an interview, ""The Democrats in Washington are in control and so absolutely it resonates to them. The bottom line here is that people don't want government on their backs and they want them out of their pocket."" Manchin also admits that the president's unpopularity in West Virginia is a real issue. ""It has made a difference in my race,"" said Manchin, but quickly noted, ""President Obama is not on the ballot. He will not be a U.S. senator. He's definitely not on the ballot in West Virginia. It's me"" The ""me"" Manchin reminds people of is the governor they really like who has brought the state's deficit down and kept unemployment lower than the national average. ""Our state is stronger now than ever. Most states are struggling to survive,"" he said. ""We have not cut any services. We have not raised any taxes. We're still cutting the taxes, you know, and we have not laid anybody off."" Manchin also boasts about the broad coalition of support for his candidacy, from the AFL-CIO, to the Chamber of Commerce, to the NRA and coal miners associations. ""I am fiercely independent,"" Manchin said. He is now working harder to reinforce that image and distance himself from his own party's policies that are unpopular in his state. Earlier this year, Manchin said he supported the Democratic Party's health care legislation. Now he wants to repeal all but a handful of provisions, like no discrimination for pre-existing conditions. ""That's a pretty good start. Why don't you start with that? Kill the rest of it. Start with what you agree on,"" said Manchin. He also said in an interview that he now believes if the near $800 billion stimulus bill was before him as a senator, he would have voted no. ""You know what? The expansion of that, that's not who I am,"" said Manchin. The federal government allocated about $1.5 billion in stimulus money for West Virginia, but Manchin said he would only take part of that, and insisted he would spend it slowly and judiciously. Manchin and Democrats here are hitting back against Raese by painting the wealthy miner and media magnate as out of touch with West Virginia voters. Democratic strategists have been pushing the fact that Raese's family lives in Florida, not West Virginia. The GOP candidate told CNN the reason for that is because his 12-year-old daughter has special needs. ""There are not a lot of services around for that special child, and so we picked out a school that would be a very good school for her,"" said Raese. ""But we have houses here in West Virginia. This is where I vote. This is where I'm from. I'm running for the U.S. Senate, but I'll do anything I can to take care of my children,"" he added. Democrats are also sending around a photo of a pink marble driveway outside of Raese's Florida home. ""I think it's a good freedom of choice and the last time I checked here in America we are free, even to have a pink marble driveway,"" he said. But Manchin's television ad hits the Raese-is-not-like-you theme on an issue, not a personal preference: Raese wants to end the mimimum wage. ""Minimum wage is something Franklin Delano Roosevelt put in during the Depression. It didn't work during the Depression and it certainly hasn't worked now,"" Raese said. ""The laws of supply and demand have to start working. We have to get back to free enterprise in this country."" He emphatically defended what he called his ""conviction."" ""Minimum wage has never worked in this country. It's something that hurts a lot of youth employment in this country,"" he said. The GOP Senate candidate also wants to eliminate the Department of Education, which he calls redundant to what the states are doing, and get rid of the Department of Energy too. ""It costs us $32 billion a year to have the Department of Energy. They don't drill wells and they don't dig mines,"" Raese said. If Raese makes it to the Senate, he says he'll also vote to do away with the Internal Revenue Service. ""We spend millions of dollars every year just for the right to pay our taxes, but once again, do we really need to do that? Why don't we simplify it?"" asked Raese, who says he is considering a ""fair"" or flat tax. It is unclear how much support Raese has for those views in West Virginia. What is clear is that to beat the popular governor, he's going to have to rely on a lot of voters like Nathan Rose, the manager at First Watch diner in Charleston. Rose said in an interview that he doesn't know a lot about Raese, and doesn't much care. ""I just know that the primary thing about him is that he's going to oppose Obama,"" said Rose. ""That's what matters to me.""","Republican millionaire is making a strong run against a popular governor running for Senate .

"London (CNN) -- Britain's Royal Mail has added nearly 14,000 extra rounds for its postal deliverers, hoping to clear a huge holiday backlog caused by winter weather woes. The service said it planned to complete 7,000 extra delivery routes Sunday, bringing packages, cards and letters to a million homes and addresses in an effort to catch up on deliveries during what it calls Britain's coldest December in decades. About 6,500 extra deliveries were made last Sunday in the areas hardest hit by the severe weather, Royal Mail said. ""This is already the worst December weather the UK has seen for almost 30 years,"" Mark Higson, managing director of Royal Mail, said in a statement. ""We are planning up 7,000 delivery rounds this Sunday as we continue our drive to deliver items as quickly as possible."" Online retailers are feeling the chill, too. Amazon.com's UK service has halted taking orders for its special rush delivery option and recommends giving e-gift cards instead of packages. Retailer Marks & Spencer also said that it could no longer guarantee that orders placed now would arrive in time for Christmas, except for flowers. Royal Mail had previously announced plans to add up to 3,000 extra workers and 250 delivery trucks to brave the icy roads. It warned there's little time left to get packages delivered. Tuesday is the deadline for first-class mail and packets that customers want to arrive in time for Christmas, Royal Mail said.

"(CNN) -- A purse used to smack a gunman at a Florida school board meeting has sold on eBay for $13,100, the auction site said Wednesday. Proceeds from the sale will go to Salvage Santa, a charity started by Mike Jones that restores old bicycles and toys and gives them to children in the Florida Panhandle around the holidays. Jones is the security officer who police said shot and wounded 56-year-old Clay Duke after he took over a Bay District School Board meeting earlier in December, upset that the district had fired his wife. Duke later shot and killed himself. Before that, Duke allowed board member Ginger Littleton to leave the room, while ordering six of her colleagues to stay. But she came back, snuck up from behind Duke and swung her purse at his hand. The move didn't work: Duke kept control of the gun. But he didn't pull the trigger, and Littleton was allowed to leave a second time. A television reporter contacted Littleton and proposed that she put her faux crocodile leather purse up for sale on eBay. She said it was an easy decision, especially given that it would benefit Jones' charity. ""The hero of the day was Mike Jones,"" Littleton said. ""I thought, 'Wow, what closure for everyone. This was a way to tie everything up.'"" CNN's Amanda Watts contributed to this report.","Ginger Littleton hit the gunman with the purse .

"(CNN) -- Democrats, as President Obama said Wednesday, took a shellacking in Tuesday's contentious midterm elections. They lost control of the House to Republicans but managed to cling onto a reduced majority in the Senate. The election will reverberate throughout American politics, with the newcomers vowing to lower government spending, cut taxes and torpedo the president's health-care legislation. The Republican victory generated an outpouring of commentary. Here are some thoughts from CNN.com's opinion section. Message to Obama: Americans want jobs . The midterm election was clearly a repudiation. The question is, a repudiation of what? Fifty years of data from one election after another has shown that people vote with their gut, and this year the gut of the American voter -- left, right and center -- was angry and anxious. It's not hard to understand why: One in 10 Americans of working age is out of a job and six in 10 are living from paycheck to paycheck. In times like these, most people can tell you what they are feeling, but when asked what would make them feel better, they can only guess. So in exit polls, some said we need to cut deficits and that would make them feel better. Others said they'd like to see the government do something, anything, to create jobs, something an anemic private sector has proved unable to do -- and has not done since the passage nearly a decade ago of the Bush tax cuts, which stimulated nothing but inequality.

Why did California vote down legal pot? California voters have just rejected Proposition 19, the ballot initiative that would have legalized marijuana under state law. Where did Prop 19 go wrong? Prop 19 failed in part because many proponents emphasized the wrong arguments for legalization. Many advocates promised major benefits to California's budget because of reduced expenditure on marijuana prohibition and increased revenue from marijuana taxation. Other supporters claimed Mexican drug violence would fall substantially. Both claims were overblown. The budgetary benefits, while not insignificant, would have been small compared with California's fiscal mess. Mexican drug violence is mainly associated with the cocaine and methamphetamine trades, as well as from marijuana traffic to other states. Many voters sensed that Prop 19 supporters were overreaching, and this made them suspicious of all the arguments in its favor. Common sense should have recognized that since marijuana was close to legal already, Prop 19 would not have had dramatic effects.

Billions of dollars poured into political ads this election cycle. They weren't just negative commercials or attack ads, but messages of searing personal indictment. The question is: Did they work? There's no easy answer, but there's a nuanced one. Under the right circumstances -- where these attack missiles connect with a pre-existing (even a latent) negative perception -- they can be devastatingly effective. Repetition makes them work even better. This is a phenomenon called the ""illusory truth effect"" and holds that hearing something multiple times increases its perception of accuracy.

Republicans effectively gained control over Congress on Tuesday. The GOP won a majority of seats in the House of Representatives, thus overturning the gains Democrats made in 2006 and 2008. In the Senate, where the procedural power of the minority has already given Republicans the power to shape deliberations, the narrowed Democratic ranks will further weaken the majority. In the weeks running up to the election, there were some commentators who concluded that the current situation would be the best outcome for President Obama. ... Yet this analogy rests on a selective memory of what happened after 1994, which is particularly surprising from someone who worked in the administration. The period that followed those midterms was among the most contentious in recent American politics.

Many will call the 2010 election the rejection of the Obama agenda heard round the world. But young voter turnout tells a very different story. CNN's exit polls show 55 percent of voters 25 to 29 voted for Democrats, compared with 42 percent for Republicans. Even more striking, 58 percent of voters age 18 to 24 voted for Democrats compared to 39 percent for Republicans. Ironically, the group often labeled fickle and impatient have remained solidly committed to the agenda of change they overwhelmingly voted for in 2008. In the face of record unemployment and the very circumstances that pundits speculate make the country more resistant to change, young voters sent a very clear message of support for Obama's agenda.

Tuesday's elections show America is indeed a center-right country. Americans widely rejected the Democrats' big-spending policies and sent the Democratic majority in the House packing. And rightly so. For nearly two years, Americans told the Democrats they did not approve of expanded government programs with large price tags such as bailouts, the stimulus bill, Cash for Clunkers, cap and trade and ""Obama care."" Time and time again, the Democrats, misreading their election win as a mandate to increase the size and scope of the federal government dramatically, rammed through unpopular legislation against the will of the majority of the American people. Tuesday, they paid the price for their arrogance and miscalculations. The Republicans won by virtue of not being Democrats. They did little to earn their victory. To many, their Pledge to America is weak tea and doesn't go far enough in reducing spending and the size of the federal government.

On a day that millions of Americans in other parts of the country turned the electoral map red by electing a sea of Republicans, California voters stayed true blue and kept doing what they usually do on Election Day -- elect Democrats. And, in a year where a lot of voters wanted to throw the bums out and get rid of career politicians, Californians -- in the headliner contests -- rejected a pair of wealthy and former Silicon Valley CEOs in favor of a couple of longtime politicians and party insiders who, between them, have spent more than a half century (58 years) in political office. The rest of the country was experiencing a revolution. In California, it was more like a ""retro-lution."" Familiarity did not necessarily breed contempt.

"(CNN) -- Many computer engineers consider a job offer from Google as the golden ticket. Outdoor volleyball courts, free gourmet food, on-site haircuts, massages and laundry are among the perks Google has offered its employees at its main campus in Mountain View, California. But some of the people who do leave are challenging the company in the best way an engineer knows how: by developing programs that could detract from Google's core business. Brian Kennish worked at Google for seven years, managing teams of engineers on a variety of products such as the Chrome browser and the moribund Google Wave. Near the end of his stint at Google, Kennish developed a browser extension for Chrome called Facebook Disconnect. The software blocks websites that have Facebook widgets installed from automatically sending information about the user back to the social networking company. Facebook Disconnect has 75,000 users, Kennish said. ""No one at Google asked me to do it,"" Kennish told CNN this week. What sparked Kennish's project, he said, was reading the recent scrutiny of online data-collection tactics chronicled by news organizations. The Wall Street Journal has been running a series called ""What They Know,"" and CNN had its own last week called ""End of Privacy."" While Facebook and the applications that run on its platform can be considered personal-data hoarders, Kennish eventually realized his then-employer was, itself, among the biggest collectors. To name a few practices, Google can track search queries over time, target ads to its Gmail users based on the contents of e-mails, and use a person's location data to determine which shops' ads it will show. Google, like many Web advertising companies, uses small files called cookies to track internet surfing habits in order to better target ads. ""I never worked directly with user data,"" Kennish said of his time at Google. ""I didn't have a good sense of what was being collected. Privacy wasn't a passion of mine or something that I knew a lot about until basically two months ago, when I started reading about this stuff."" Kennish left Google in November to focus more on programs that empower people to take control of their privacy online. ""I had this holy-cow moment when I realized what was going on,"" Kennish said. ""There's just so much unknown about what's being done with this data."" ""I think there is a good reason to be concerned with it all and, frankly, to be fearful of it,"" he said. Last week, he released a second browser extension, another tool for Google Chrome, called Disconnect. Once installed, the program blocks major internet companies, including Google, from installing cookies on -- and thus tracking -- a computer. People using Disconnect can decide which cookies they'd like to allow onto their system. Cookies can be helpful when, for example, you'd like a website to remember your login credentials and not ask for them every time you visit. ""I would like to see us move to a point where all the data that's collected about folks is intentional,"" rather than without people's knowledge, Kennish said. ""So if I give you permission to collect my data, then go ahead and do it."" In its first week, 25,000 people downloaded Disconnect. Kennish is releasing a new version Friday that lets users choose whether Google can personalize search queries based on the data it has about the person. By default, Disconnect blocks Google from doing this. ""Any data that's collected has the potential to escape the collector,"" Kennish said. ""So I would like to see Google only collect data that I explicitly allow them to collect."" Google hosts a dashboard for users to review a breakdown of the messages and information attached to their accounts. The Google Privacy Center provides information on how the company collects data and lets people, whether they're registered with Google or not, opt out of ad and analytics tracking. Michael Gundlach, another ex-Google engineer, developed an alternative to complicated opt-out systems that vary between ad networks. Like Disconnect, it's a browser extension, and there are versions for Chrome and Apple's Safari. Called AdBlock, Gundlach's program can prevent Web pages from loading and displaying ads. That includes Google's ads, which account for the vast majority of the search giant's revenue. AdBlock offers a setting to easily enable ads from Gundlach's former employer, though those ads are disabled by default. ""Google didn't ask me to put that in,"" Gundlach wrote in an e-mail. ""I find Google text ads to be useful."" Still, Gundlach says he blocks most ads because ""I don't wish to be bombarded by consumerism."" The real economic conundrum: If website visitors don't pay figuratively -- by watching ads or by having their personal information sent to advertisers -- they may have to start paying real money for online services. Kennish plans to devote six months to developing Disconnect and will reevaluate then whether it could be a sustainable business. He's ""pretty close"" to releasing an extension for Safari and recently began working on one for Firefox, he said. If he's forced to abandon the project, the source code is freely available to any enterprising developers who want to take up the cause. ""The only business model I see,"" Kennish said, is to eventually provide a more advanced version of the software that costs money. ""When I use something like Google, I'm paying for Google with my attention and my data,"" he said. ""There's no such thing as free. These are companies that have to pay employees' salaries."" Parts of Google's maturing business may clash with some of the wide-eyed engineers it hopes to attract, especially those passionate about taking risks to change the world, hopefully for the better. But a Google spokesman, who declined to comment on most questions pertaining to this story, said the company's attrition rate -- that is, the percentage of employees that defect -- hasn't changed in more than seven years and is better than the industry standard. In addition to all the on-campus amenities, a program called ""20% Time"" lets Google engineers devote a sizable chunk of their work weeks to projects of their choosing. (Kennish said he developed Facebook Disconnect after work hours.) The perks haven't stopped some high-profile people from leaving the company. Product designer Douglas Bowman left in a huff last year for a job at Twitter after reportedly becoming fed up with nearly three years of what he publicly described as Google's design-by-committee mentality. Some notable Google alumni are spiting their former employer in a different way -- by joining Facebook. The social network is perceived by some as Google's biggest rival. People are spending more of their time online using Facebook. They're thumbing through photos and asking questions to friends, rather than searching the wider Web. Google is unable to crawl most of the data posted to Facebook. As Google-to-Facebook defections grow,  Google is reportedly offering some employees multimillion-dollar packages to convince them not to go to Facebook. After wooing executives who worked on Google-owned YouTube, Android and advertising; the architect of Google Maps; and at least two Gmail co-founders, this week, Facebook claimed Paul Adams, a former Google employee who was previously an outspoken critic of the social network. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's venerable chief operating officer, also came from the big G. But abandoning Google hasn't always proved to be a wise or permanent move. Anna Patterson left the company in 2007 to start a rival search engine called Cuil. When that tanked, she returned to Google in September.","Some Google employees are leaving to create or join rival businesses .

"(CNN) -- Despite President Barack Obama's signing of a law repealing the military's ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy, Defense Secretary Robert Gates sent a memo to troops warning them that it remains in effect until 60 days after the government certifies that the military is ready for implementation. The Pentagon says it does not know how long the certification process may take. In the meantime, Gates is essentially telling gays and lesbians serving in the military not to come out until 60 days after that determination is made. ""In order to prevent any confusion, I want to be perfectly clear: at this time, there are no new changes to any existing Department or Service policies,"" said the memo, released Thursday. ""Service members who alter their personal conduct during this period may face adverse consequences,"" Gates wrote. Before the ban is completely lifted, the president, the secretary of defense and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff will have to certify that the repeal can move ahead without negatively affecting unit cohesion and military readiness. Since October, the military has dismissed at least eight service members for violations of the policy, according to Pentagon spokesman Col. David Lapan. But Lapan said those dismissals had been approved prior to Oct. 21, when Gates tightened the rules about who in the Pentagon can dismiss a service member for violating the policy. Now, only the civilian service secretaries, in consultation with the Pentagon's top lawyer and head of personnel, can order dismissals. No new cases have resulted in dismissals since then. Gates also said he now endorses all the recommendations of the Pentagon's working group on ""don't ask, don't tell"" as the road map for implementation. There will be no special bathroom or housing facilities to accommodate homosexuals, except in special cases. And troops who oppose serving with homosexuals will not be allowed to quit the military before their commitment is up.","President Obama signed into law a repeal of ""don't ask, don't tell""

"(CNN) -- Ryan Lochte doubled his gold-medal haul on the final day of the 10th FINA world short-course swimming championships in Dubai on Sunday. The American added gold in the men's 200 meter backstroke -- setting a new championship-best time -- and the men's 100m individual medley. The 26-year-old, the leading U.S. swimmer in the absence of his main rival Michael Phelps, also claimed a team gold as the U.S. won the 4x100m medley relay event, taking his title tally to six in Dubai. Sunday's results took his overall medal total in all short-course world championships (which are held in 25m pools) to 21 -- four more than the previous record of 17 held by Sweden's Therese Alshammar. Lochte's tally of seven medals at the 2010 championships is also a record, as he also picked up a silver in the 4x200m free relay. ""I knew before the meet that my last day would be one of the toughest, but I am always up for the challenge. This is probably one of the worst shapes I have been in for a world championships,"" he told the sport's official website. ""I'm not really 100%. I've done a lot of training, I haven't really rested for this meet and it's actually very good for me because it makes me want to race harder and it's a stepping stone for the [2011] Shanghai worlds."" The United States led the final medals table with 25, which included 12 golds. Russia finished second on 10 (four golds), Spain claimed third place with eight (four golds), while China finished fourth with 14 medals (three golds). Brazil's Cesar Cielo Filho completed a double in the freestyle sprint events, taking gold in the men's 100m ahead of French swimmer Fabien Gilot and Russia's Nikita Lobintsev to follow up his victory in the 50m. Felipe Silva gave Brazil a third gold of the week when he won the 50m breaststroke in a championships-record time of 25.95 seconds. In the women's events, Rebecca Soni secured a clean sweep in the breaststroke after adding the 200 meters title to the 50 and 100 meter she won earlier in the week. All her victories came in championship record times. But it was Mireia Belmonte Garcia who was crowned the most successful female swimmer at the championships with four medals. The 20-year-old Spaniard claimed three gold medals (200 meter butterfly, 200 meter and 400 meter individual medley) and one silver in the 800 meter freestyle. Sweden's Therese Alshammar equaled the record of women's overall medals by winning silver in the 100m butterfly to match the 17 achieved by former U.S. swimmer Jenny Thompson. Felicity Galvez won the race in a championships-record time of 55.43 to retain her title and give Australia a first gold of the competition. China's Jing Zhao also set a new best time in winning the 50m backstroke in 26.27, while world record-holder Rebecca Soni of the U.S. set another milestone in the 200m breaststroke as she clocked 2:16.39 to clinch a hat-trick of golds in the discipline.","Lochte wins three golds on last day of world short-course swimming championships .

"(CNN) -- A California-based commercial pilot says the Transportation Security Administration retaliated against him after he posted videos online showing what he described as shortcomings in airport security. The series of videos showed scenes from inside the San Francisco International Airport and were narrated by the pilot, who pointed out the contrast between the passengers who were heavily scrutinized, while a single door separated employees who worked on the airfield from the airport. ""I was trying to bring up the obvious, ludicrous TSA-type of security,"" the pilot said, referring to the cell phone videos he posted, and later removed, from the popular video-sharing website YouTube. The pilot requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. He said he didn't think much about posting his videos online in late November, but that within a matter of days, his chief pilot called him to ask him to remove the videos because they were ""stirring a commotion."" A few days after that, the pilot was informed by the TSA that he was being suspended from a program in which he participated, the Federal Flight Deck Officer program. As an officer in the program, he was deputized by TSA to carry a handgun in the cockpit. ""Basically, an air marshal in the sky,"" the pilot said of the volunteer program. After his suspension, four air marshals and two local deputies showed up at his home near Sacramento, California, to personally confiscate his weapon. The only answer he could get from the TSA as to why he was suspended from the program was that he may have violated a regulation, he said. The TSA said that it holds those serving as federal flight deck officers to ""the highest ethical standards,"" and said it took action because the pilot was in the program. ""FFDOs must be able to maintain sensitive security information as a condition of the FFDO program,"" TSA spokeswoman Sarah Horowitz said. ""As the issuing authority of credentials and firearms, TSA reviews each possible violation of those standards and acts accordingly up to and including removing an individual from the assigned role."" Horowitz also defended security measures at the San Francisco airport, saying that there are ""measures in place that are both seen and unseen."" In the aftermath of the incident, the pilot said he resigned from the program. In the age of WikiLeaks, where divulging sensitive information can be so controversial, why did this pilot decide to share his videos so publicly? ""I didn't think anything would come of it,"" said the 50-year-old pilot, a veteran who was a maintenance test pilot. ""This is really about getting the message out and demanding intelligent security,"" Don Werno, the pilot's attorney, said. ""No state secrets are being shown here. What's being shown here is a lack of security."" Beyond the TSA action, the pilot's airline had not taken any action against him, and he counts on the support of his union. However, when the sheriff's deputies showed up at his house with the air marshals, they also took his California concealed weapons permit. The pilot said this permit was unrelated to his work for the TSA. CNN's Jim Barnett contributed to this report.","The videos show what he called lax security at the San Francisco airport .

"New York (CNN) -- Gov. David A. Paterson commuted the prison sentence Thursday of a man convicted of killing an unarmed teenage boy during a racially charged confrontation, officials said. John White was convicted of second-degree manslaughter and third-degree criminal possession of a weapon in the shooting death of 17-year-old Daniel Cicciaro and was sentenced to up to four years in prison. ""It's a blessed day, it truly is,"" White told CNN affiliate WPIX. ""I want to thank my savior, the Lord Jesus Christ. I also want to thank the governor for making this happen today."" He had served approximately five months in prison before Paterson allowed his release on Thursday, according to Suffolk County District Attorney Thomas J. Spota. Paterson said in a written statement: ""My decision today may be an affront to some and a joy to others, but my objective is only to seek to ameliorate the profound suffering that occurred as a result of this tragic event."" But the move was criticized by prosecutors who helped put White behind bars. ""I strongly believe the governor should have had the decency and the compassion to at least contact the victim's family to allow them to be heard before commuting the defendant's sentence,"" said Spota, whose office prosecuted White. The shooting occurred in August 2006 in the Long Island town of Miller Place, after a group of teenagers went to White's home over a dispute with his 19-year-old son. White, who is African-American, said that he was protecting his family from a white lynch mob and the gun discharged accidentally. Prosecutors said White should have called police instead of deliberately choosing to confront Cicciaro and a group of his friends with a .32-caliber Beretta. Police said the incident started with an internet prank sent by another person from the MySpace page of White's 20-year-old son.","NEW: John White says of his sentence being commuted: ""It's a blessed day""

"(CNN) -- The surviving members of The Doors don't have many kind words for the recent pardon of legendary singer Jim Morrison by Florida authorities. Outgoing Florida Gov. Charlie Crist helped pave the way for the pardon earlier this month, clearing Morrison from a 40-year-old indecent exposure arrest and conviction. But Morrison's old bandmates, Ray Manzarek, John Densmore and Robby Krieger, said the gesture was too little too late. ""We don't feel Jim needs to be pardoned for anything,"" The Doors members said in a statement Wednesday. ""The charges against him were largely an opportunity for grandstanding by ambitious politicians -- not to mention an affront to free speech and a massive waste of time and taxpayer dollars."" The statements also said: ""If the State of Florida and the City of Miami want to make amends for the travesty of Jim Morrison's arrest and prosecution 40 years after the fact, an apology would be more appropriate -- and expunging the whole sorry matter from the record."" Morrison had been performing with the band at a typically raucous concert at Miami's Key Auditorium on March 1, 1969, when the incident took place. Reportedly drunk and slurring obscenities at the crowd, he was accused of unzipping his pants and simulating a sex act, a charge he denied. Despite being acquitted of lascivious behavior and drunkenness, Morrison was convicted of indecent exposure and open profanity, and sentenced to six months in jail. He was still appealing the verdict in 1971 when he died in Paris of a heart attack at the age of 27. He would have turned 67 on Wednesday. Doors fans have long appealed for an official pardon for ""The Lizard King,"" petitioning previous Florida governors without success. Many argue that the trial was a sham and that there was no conclusive evidence supporting the exposure charge against Morrison.","Morrison was accused of shouting obscenities at a crowd and exposing himself .

"(CNN) -- A 13-year-old Indian boy has batted his way into cricket history with a record-breaking innings of 498 in a school tournament in Mumbai, India. Armaan Jaffer, the nephew of former India international batsman Wasim Jaffer, hit the highest score ever made by a schoolboy in a local under-14 competition on Wednesday. It was only three runs short of the alltime first-class record set by West Indies star Brian Lara in 1994. Jaffer's huge total came from 490 balls, from which he hit 77 fours, and surpassed the 439 his Rizvi Springfield school teammate Sarfaraz Khan scored in 2009. Rizvi eventually declared on an intimidating 800-8, with opponents IES Raja Shivaji School on 52-2 in reply at the end of the second day's play. Despite his notable achievement, Jaffer expressed his regret that he was unable to reach 500 runs. ""I am a little disappointed that I missed the 500-mark but as we say, 'One mistake and you are back in the pavilion,' "" he said in quotes reported on the Cricinfo website. Jaffer and his teammates talk about his feat on YouTube . His uncle Wasim had previously broken the same record, but Jaffer insisted beating the landmark figure never crossed his mind and he thanked his coach Raju Pathak for his guidance during the innings. ""I was not thinking about any record, not about Sarfaraz's 439 and not even about Wasim uncle's 403. I was just following my coach's instructions. I am thankful to him for his motivation."" Pathak said he had given his batsman a free reign to play as he wished, having been on 295 when he resumed his innings. ""He is a very disciplined player,"" he said. ""I had told him last evening I want you to play a long innings, so go ahead and score as many runs you want. ""Based on your innings, we will declare the target. But he surprised me as well and created a record innings. I am very pleased with his game."" Like millions of young cricket hopefuls in India, there is one man who Jaffer hopes to emulate when he is older. ""Sachin Tendulkar is my idol. His determination and focus are the things that stand out.""","Indian schoolboy Armaan Jaffer hits a record-breaking 498 in an under-14's tournament .

"New York (CNN) -- Performances of the troubled Broadway musical ""Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark"" are scheduled to resume Thursday evening after a performer was injured during a show, a spokesman said. The show's producers acted on the guidance of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the New York State Department of Labor, according to spokesman Rick Miramontez. During Monday's performance, 31-year-old Christopher Tierney fell at least 20 feet and was hospitalized. Earlier, Broadway actor Adam Pascal called for the prosecution of the show's director, Julie Taymor, because of a series of recent mishaps, including Tierney's injury. ""They should put Julie Taymor in jail for assault!"" Pascal posted on the social networking site Facebook. He called for lawsuits against Taymor and others invested in the production, such as musical stars Bono and David Howell Evans. Pascal later recanted the comments, saying, ""I think some of you missed the intended humor in my post, although my anger is real, I don't think anyone should sue Bono and the Edge you dummy! Or put Julie Taymor in jail you double dummy. I was making a point."" Pascal's representative, Rich Aronstein from RJ productions, confirmed the posts were authentic. The show, with music and lyrics by U2's Bono and Howell (aka The Edge), is the most expensive in Broadway history, but production has been beset by cast injuries and technical problems. Taymor said the accident was ""obviously heartbreaking for our entire team and, of course, to me personally."" ""I am so thankful that Chris is going to be all right and is in great spirits,"" Taymor said in a statement Tuesday. ""Nothing is more important than the safety of our Spider-Man family and we'll continue to do everything in our power to protect the cast and crew."" Tierney was initially listed in serious condition at Bellevue Hospital. The fall that injured him was caused by human error, the Actors Equity Association, a performers' union, said Wednesday. On Tuesday, the ""Spider-Man"" company met with officials from the union, as well as representatives of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the New York State Department of Labor. The union did not give details on the error, but the group said it worked with the other agencies to develop a safety plan to address the issue. Initially, only the Wednesday matinee performance was postponed after the incident, and performances were to resume Wednesday evening.","An actor fell during the performance and was hospitalized on Monday .

"(CNN) -- When I was a child, I always wondered how an ocean liner could fit on my street. Never mind that a ship needed water. I lived on a small street in a small town in northern New Jersey and my father would constantly make reference to a time when his ship would come in. I later learned that this was a figure of speech that described a future time when our family's financial resources would increase. And until that time arrived, we would live within our means and limit our purchases to those items that we could afford. My father was committed to debt-free living. Now that I am an adult, I understand this commitment more than ever. My congregation embarked upon a debt-free mission five years ago that has reaped tremendous rewards for many of our families. The mission is called ""dfree"" and the ""d"" stands for debt, delinquencies and deficits. We are attempting to break the culture of debt that has become a plague in our society and start a family-based economic empowerment movement. The three focal points of debt, delinquency and deficit represent the cornerstones of family financial strength. First, debt: Americans owe a lot of money. The levels of family debt are threatening our ability to develop any meaningful wealth or to pass that wealth on to future generations. Second, the commitment to eliminating delinquencies means that we, as a congregation, are pledging to pay our bills on time. Late payments lower our credit scores and this causes us to pay higher interest rates even on good debt such as mortgages. Lastly, to be free of deficit living means to live within our means and thus eliminate the need to close our spending gaps by using high interest credit cards or --even worse -- alternative financial services such as payday loans, pawnshops and rent-to-own schemes. These three objectives are the foundation of our dfree campaign. In formulating our campaign, (participation is free) we discovered that there is an abundance of educational and informational materials available for people who want to become financially literate and economically self-sufficient. The challenge is to motivate people to find and apply the information. Therefore, dfree is a strategy rather than just a curriculum. Dfree does involve classes, seminars and other events. But the driving principle is to popularize debt-free living and to teach people how to achieve it. When church members testify on Sundays during the worship experience that they have paid off multiple credit cards or finished paying for a car, the entire congregation affirms them by celebrating their victory with handclaps and shouts. Such affirmation and celebration has begun to change the culture of our entire membership. This is an important mission for our church, but any church can do it. This ministry helps strengthen families, it builds self-esteem and it increases the capacity of the church itself. We built a new church complex in the 1990s that put the church $20 million in debt. Our leadership agreed that if the church helped the members get out of debt, perhaps the members would help the church get out of debt. And that is exactly what began to happen within months of our starting the dfree ministry. The dfree approach is not only good for churches. Community organizations, credit unions and student groups can also adapt the strategy for their members. Every organization that cares about its members has the potential to help them break the cycle of debt in their lives. The dfree instruction gives people a chance to grow in groups and the teaching is divided into four levels: 1. Get Started; 2. Get Control; 3. Get Ahead; 4. Give Back. Each unit lasts three months and includes training designed to help students become teachers. Merchandise and tools are available for churches that decide to become a part of the dfree movement. Dfree has also formed a partnership with a national bank that provides a low-cost, custom prepaid debit card that eliminates bank overdraft fees that can be so expensive. This debit card is a key tool for those attempting to take control of their finances. We also have a dfree pledge that we provide all of our members. This plastic card is the size of a credit card that serves as a reminder to ""Say yes to No Debt."" The dfree pledge is on the back of the card: . I pledge to: . • Apply biblical principles in managing my finances . • Keep my expenses below my income . • Pay my bills on time . • Invest in assets that grow in value . • Contribute to my church and its ministries . There are many definitions of freedom. Given the avalanche of bankruptcies, foreclosures and high-interest credit card debt that many people are experiencing, there may be no greater need than to understand the value and joy of debt-free living. There may be no greater legacy we can leave our children. Our ships can come in if we make a commitment to debt free living and teach our children how to manage money and invest in their futures. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the Rev. DeForest Soaries, Jr.","The Rev. Soaries says part of mission is helping church fight debt, delinquencies, deficit .
Church devised dfree program to guide congregants, others in resolving debt, he says .
Once they do this, he says, community may also help church pay off cost of new complex .

"Washington (CNN) -- A compromise bill to provide free medical treatment and compensation to first responders of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack won final approval Wednesday from the House and Senate, sending it to President Barack Obama to be signed into law. The bill passed on a voice vote in the Senate, and then on a 206-60 vote in the House on the final day of the lame-duck session of Congress. Jubilant Democrats hailed the last-minute approval as a $4.2 billion triumph for firefighters, police officers and other emergency personnel who put themselves in harm's way to help others in the aftermath of the 2001 terrorist attack. Even though the vote was kept open for more than an hour, 168 House members did not participate. Missing were 89 Republicans, including incoming Speaker John Boehner, and 79 Democrats. Still, there was a quorum -- a simple majority of 435 House members -- to vote on the bill. Many House members also were absent Tuesday. Some likely went home for the holidays after the earlier funding votes, while others were members who are retiring or lost re-election bids. The vote was the last by the House for the year, as it later adjourned until January 5, when a new Congress will be sworn in and Boehner takes the speaker's gavel. Outgoing Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who presided over the chamber for the conclusion of Wednesday's vote, said the discussion was ""about holy and sacred ground."" New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, who acknowledged that approval of the bill was in doubt until a few hours before the vote, called it a ""great day"" for the nation -- and especially for first responders sickened by exposure to toxic pollution from the collapse of the World Trade Center towers, because now they know their country will take care of them. In New York, outgoing Democratic Gov. David Paterson said the bill ""will provide much-needed funds for medical treatment to the rescue workers and residents of New York City who suffered illnesses from breathing in toxic fumes, dust and smoke from ground zero."" He said it also reopens the victims' compensation fund for rescue workers who were hurt as a result of the attacks. Mayor Michael Bloomberg said the Senate's approval of the bill ""affirms our nation's commitment to protecting those who protect us all,"" and some of those first responders also welcomed the development but questioned why it took so long. Kenny Specht, a former New York firefighter suffering from thyroid cancer, described his first exposure to Washington politics as a ""baptism by fire."" ""It was a lot of time and a lot of effort and it's a little disappointing to see something like this only now receive the bipartisan support that it should have received from the beginning,"" Specht said. Negotiations Wednesday morning involving Schumer and fellow Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York with Republican Sens. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma and Mike Enzi of Wyoming led to a deal that reduced the cost of the bill by $2 billion and made other changes sought by GOP opponents, according to statements by the participants. ""The Christmas Miracle we've been looking for has arrived,"" said a statement issued by Schumer and Gillibrand, adding: ""We are pleased to announce that we crafted an agreement that will allow this legislation to pass the Senate, and the House, this afternoon. We thank our Republican friends for coming together to fulfill America's moral obligation to the heroes of 9/11."" Coburn, a conservative who led the opposition to the bill, said the agreement produced a better piece of legislation. ""Every American recognizes the heroism of the 9/11 first responders, but it is not compassionate to help one group while robbing future generations of opportunity,"" said Coburn, who had demanded that the cost of the bill be lowered and fully paid for. ""I'm pleased this agreement strikes a fair balance and improves the bill the majority attempted to rush through at the last minute."" According to Coburn, the agreement reduces the overall cost of the bill by $2 billion to a total of $4.2 billion over a 10-year period. His statement said that $1.5 billion of the cost goes for health benefits and $2.7 billion will pay for compensation for health problems of emergency responders. The agreement also caps attorneys' fees at 10 percent of any total compensation award, and includes potential limits on compensation for individuals who already have received workers compensation for injuries due to the 9/11 response, the Coburn statement said. Democrats previously agreed to pay for the bill with fees collected on various services involving foreign countries and foreign visitors. On Tuesday, Schumer said it appeared the bill would come up for a Senate vote once lawmakers voted on New START, a nuclear arms control pact with Russia that is one of Obama's top foreign policy priorities. Both votes occurred Wednesday afternoon. The James Zadroga 9/11 Health Bill is named after a deceased New York Police Department detective who had worked in the toxic plume at ground zero. The House earlier passed the previous version of the bill on a mostly partisan 268-160 vote. According to the bill's supporters, it is funded by a procurement fee on some foreign countries that trade with the United States, the continuation of a fee on some travelers to the United States and a fee on visas for some companies. The version being negotiated by the senators Wednesday drops some of those funding sources. On Tuesday, a group of 9/11 first responders joined lawmakers in Washington to urge the Senate to pass the health care bill. ""We continue to see our friends die on a day-to-day basis,"" said Glen Klein, a New York police officer who said he is sick with lung disease. ""We're asking for the right to live."" In the years following the attacks, health experts have noted respiratory and mental health conditions, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, in those who engaged in ground zero rescue and cleanup efforts. CNN's Tom Cohen, Deidre Walsh and Jesse Solomon contributed to this report.","NEW: 168 members of the House did not vote .

"(CNN) -- Iranians coped with soaring gas and food prices sparked by the government's removal of massive revolutionary-era subsidies as President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad left Wednesday for a two-day economic summit in Turkey. In the Iranian capital, Tehran, police manned gas stations as some cab drivers hiked fares and residents complained about prices going up fourfold for essential items after the government began slashing subsidies to help bolster the Islamic republic's sagging oil-based economy. The government began its plan to remove subsidies on Sunday and deployed security forces to several major gas stations in the capital city, Tehran, to offset the threat of potential protests. In 2007, protesters torched a dozen gas stations after the government's abrupt decision to ration monthly fuel allotments. The cuts in subsidies are far more severe but the response has been muted. Iran observers attribute it to a climate of fear following a government crackdown in the aftermath of the 2009 presidential election controversy. Still, Tehran residents said the government was beefing up security. Witnesses saw up to 20 police officers at three major gas stations in central and northern Tehran. ""I hope enough people will protest these ridiculous changes, but they are scared of the security forces because of the past protests where our citizens were beaten,"" said a civil engineer, who like others interviewed by CNN did not want to be identified for fear of repercussions. ""A lot of people are anxious and confused,"" said a taxi driver,  ""They don't know what's coming next but they don't have much choice."" But a courier said he didn't have time to protest. ""They just make prices go higher and life more difficult,"" he said. By Iran's own admission, the subsidies have cost the government around $100 billion a year, according to a report on state-run Press TV this week. Iran was forfeiting potentially huge revenues, according to the International Monetary Fund. ""With the removal of subsidies on oil and gas, domestic demand for energy in Iran is expected to decline, leaving more energy resources available for export. If all goes according to plan, the strategy should serve the dual purpose of generating more revenue for the country and curbing the wasteful use of energy,"" IMF Senior Economist Roman Zytek and Iran Mission Chief Dominique Guillaume said on the organization's website. Adding to Iran's economic woes are the effects of blistering international sanctions, imposed for its nuclear program, which Iran says it is developing for peaceful purposes but many other nations fear is aimed at producing a weapon. On Tuesday, the United States Treasury announced a new round of sanctions against five Iranian companies, including two banks and the country's national maritime carrier, the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines. The United States says these companies are directly associated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Both the Revolutionary Guards and the shipping line ""are major institutional participants in Iran's illicit conduct and in its attempts to evade sanctions,"" said Stuart Levey, the U.S. under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence.  ""We will therefore continue to target and expose their networks."" Ahmadinejad is expected to deliver a keynote address at the Economic Cooperation Organization on Thursday. The group aims to develop economic cooperation among Iran, Turkey, Pakistan and seven other regional nations. In erasing the subsidies, Ahmadinejad was keenly aware he was treading on the promises made to the people in the 1979 Islamic revolution, said Iranian-American journalist and author Azadeh Moaveni. But the subsidies had become unsustainable and Ahmadinejad had prepared Iranians for the need to pump more money into the economy. ""We have been told for many years that subsidies are ruining the economy and must be eliminated, but no government up to now had the determination to actually go ahead and do it,"" said a mechanic who gave his name as Abbas. Around the city, taxi drivers reacted to the cuts differently. One said he has raised his rates for rides. ""When gasoline prices almost double, my fares should also double,"" he said. But another said his company told him not to charge riders extra. Despite the rise in gasoline prices to as much as 7,000 rials (70 cents) a liter, the driver said that if he makes up to eight trips a day in his taxi, he will make up the difference in the higher price of gasoline. Iran's gas rationing program previously allowed people to buy up to 50 liters per month at around 10 cents a liter, far below what they or people anywhere else would pay on the world market. Now, Iranians are paying at least four times that -- 40 cents per liter for the first 50 liters each month and 70 cents above that. Iran has $10 trillion in oil resources alone, plus natural gas reserves worth between $3.5 trillion and $4.5 trillion, the International Monetary Fund has said. But its economy nonetheless has seen lackluster growth, including between 1% and 2% of GDP this past year. While gas prices will affect the middle and upper echelons of society, what is most worrying to others are rising prices for food. Working class Iranians will pay as much as 10 times more for bread. The government is paying $800 for two months for people who registered for help in buying bread at the higher prices.

"(CNN) -- A Florida judge set bail at $15,000 Wednesday for a man who wrote a controversial book considered a ""how-to"" guide for pedophiles. Phillip Greaves, who was arrested in Colorado on Monday, said the book, ""The  Pedophile's Guide to Love and Pleasure: A Child-Lover's Code of  Conduct,"" can be used as a guide to rehabilitating pedophiles. And,  instead of teaching them how to avoid arrest, it teaches them to avoid  illegal actions, he said. Greaves has been charged with the distribution of obscene  material depicting minors engaged in harmful conduct, Florida  authorities said. He made his first appearance in a Florida courtroom Wednesday afternoon. His court appearance came a day after he held court in front of reporters explaining the nature of his book. Asked if he is a pedophile, Greaves said, ""I only have sex with grown-ups."" He said he has no children and ""I don't keep children around my house."" Polk County, Florida, Sheriff Grady Judd has said his detectives were able to establish jurisdiction in the case by conducting an undercover operation, buying the book through the mail. Greaves protested Tuesday saying he is the target of entrapment, but Judd disagreed. ""He wrote this book, he published this book, he put it on Amazon to sell,"" Judd told reporters as Greaves was being booked into the Polk County Jail, ""and he freely responded to our desire to purchase it."" Greaves and his book gained national attention earlier this year after Amazon.com defended selling the book on its website despite angry comments and threats of boycotts from thousands of people. The book was removed from the website in early November. Officials said the book talks about safe sex and avoiding injury to children, grooming and preparing children for sex and teaching children how to lie to their parents. Judd said Greaves' book outlines a ""code of ethics"" that shows pedophiles how to look for the most vulnerable children. Greaves told reporters Tuesday he wrote the book to exorcise his own childhood. He said he was introduced to sex at the age of 7 by a 10-year-old friend and began having sex with other children. This continued, he said, until he was about 15, when he stopped and did not have sex again for years. ""Once I got into adolescence, I suppose you could have identified me as an adolescent pedophile,"" he said. But now, he said, he is an example of the fact that people can reform. ""I think all speech should be protected,"" Greaves said. But ""I was not the one who solicited the material to be sent to Florida. I think Florida law is for Floridians and Colorado law is for Coloradoans."" He told reporters he will not be able to make bond: ""I'm actually quite poor."" Judge John Kirkland said Wednesday in court that if Greaves does not post bail he must remain in Florida, cannot have contact with anyone younger than 18 and cannot have access to a computer. CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said on CNN's ""AC360"" Monday night that prosecutors may have a hard time convicting Greaves, and maintained his arrest was unconstitutional. ""I don't think they can go forward because the book is clearly protected by the First Amendment,"" Toobin said. ""This book, as awful as it is, it is only words."" Judd vehemently disagreed with Toobin's assessment of the case and the two sparred on the program. ""This has nothing to do with free speech and everything to do with obscenity,"" Judd said.  ""We had a law in Florida that  applied. We only needed  jurisdiction.""","New: A judge says Phillip Greaves cannot leave Florida .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- An ""America's Got Talent"" contestant who was questioned by police in connection with his wife's death is now offering $25,000 for information leading to a conviction in his wife's ""murder,"" the contestant says. Joe Finley, 47, a Los Angeles, California-area rock musician, said he wants to find the person responsible for what he called his wife's ""murder."" His wife's body was found just hours before he auditioned for ""America's Got Talent"" in October. On Wednesday, Lt. Fred Corral of the Los Angeles County coroner's department said Laura Finley's cause of death is still being investigated, and he added he's waiting on toxicology tests, which should be completed by the first week of January. Also this week, Los Angeles police said the case is still open and the death could have been an accident. But Finley has described police as accusing him of killing his wife, though no charges have been filed. Laura Finley, 48, who lived with her husband in Rancho Cucamonga, California, was discovered dead at the bottom of a staircase in the Millennium Biltmore Hotel in downtown Los Angeles about 8 a.m. on October 23, according to police. Joe Finley, who owns a spring-manufacturing business, has hired attorneys Sean Macias and Nareg Gourjian, who have represented a number of high-profile clients including Chris Brown and Scott Peterson. Finley has described police as urging him to confess to killing his wife. Los Angeles police declined to comment on Finley's reward offer or his assertions. Laura Finley's relatives didn't respond to messages seeking a comment this week. Joe Finley told CNN he had nothing to do with his wife's death. ""Absolutely not,"" he said. ""I would never hurt a human being."" ""I will never be arrested for my wife's murder. There is no chance. There's nothing that would ever link me to this crime,"" he added. Finley said he was thinking of his wife when he decided to go ahead with an audition for ""America's Got Talent,"" even though he'd just been told that she was possibly dead. ""It was a very emotional moment for me and a way for me to connect with my wife."" Finley said. The couple had checked into the hotel October 22 because Joe Finley was going to try out for the television talent show the next morning, he said. After partying that evening, Laura Finley left the room to get some ice, and at about 3 a.m., ""she came back and I was in bed and she said, 'You wouldn't believe what happened at the ice machine.' Then she walked into the bathroom and started a bath, and I fell asleep,"" Finley said. He said he never asked what happened at the ice machine because he was falling asleep and didn't think it was a big deal. When he awoke at 6:30 a.m., his wife was gone, he said. At 11 a.m., two Los Angeles police detectives told him that his wife may have been found dead, and police were about to take him to the station when an ""America's Got Talent"" producer stopped them as they were walking out of the hotel, Finley said. The producer wanted Finley to audition for the show, Finley said. ""He said, 'In fact, if you want to go in right now, we'll let you go in right now,' and I thought of Laura,"" Finley said. ""I thought, 'I'm gonna go in there, I'm going to be as brave and courageous as I possible can for Laura,' and so the police escorted me in there."" Finley said he chose a song that he used to sing to his wife. ""I got through almost to the end, and I broke, and I just dropped my head and I took my sunglasses off, and I said, 'I'm sorry, I can't do this. That's the best I can do,' "" Finley said. The show's production company declined to comment about Finley's audition. At the police station, detectives questioned Finley for hours about his wife's death, and they urged him to confess to killing his wife, Finley said. ""They were screaming at me,"" he told CNN. Finley said he was arrested for drug possession at the time, but as of Wednesday, Gourjian, Finley's attorney, said no charges had been filed. Finley said people shouldn't jump to any conclusions about him just because he auditioned for the show. ""To judge somebody in this position is just wrong. People should just wait, wait for the facts to come out,"" he said.","Musician Joe Finley auditioned for a TV show even though his wife had been found dead .

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- Close allies since the Soviet days, India and Russia marked the first decade of their strategic partnership with a slew of agreements at their annual summit Tuesday. In their talks, visiting Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh reviewed cooperation in military, technical, energy, high-technology and telecommunications. Both pledged to boost two-way trade, an area they accept as a weak part of their multi-faceted relationship. The two countries aim to achieve a trade target of $20 billion by 2015, up from about $7.5 billion last year, a joint statement issued at the end of the meeting between the Russian and Indian leaders noted. ""The sides recognized that considerable potential exists for mutually beneficial investments by the Russian Federation and India in the privatization programs and programs aimed at fostering technological innovation in their respective economies,"" it read. India and Russia share a robust collaboration in defense, with Moscow supplying more than 60 percent of military hardware to New Delhi. Apart from 11 agreements the two countries signed during the Medvedev-Singh news conference, a contract for joint design and development of fifth-generation fighter aircraft was also being concluded on the margins of the current summit, officials say. India's Hindustan Aeronautics Limited and Russia's Sukhoi Design Bureau and Rosoboronexport will be involved in the proposed project, according to the External Affairs Ministry. Other pacts the two nations reached sought greater collaboration in a range of fields, such as information technology, hydrocarbons and in the vital nuclear energy sector. At present, two nuclear power plants are being built in southern India with Russian assistance. Talks, Singh noted, were on for the construction of additional Russian-designed reactors. ""Both sides expressed satisfaction with the progress in bilateral cooperation in the nuclear-energy sector and looked forward to further broadening and strengthening ties in this area,"" the joint statement said. India attaches a huge priority to its ties with Russia, which it calls a time-tested friend. ""Russia is a time-tested friend of India that has stood by us in our times of need in the past. Ours is a special and privileged strategic partnership. It is a partnership that has and will continue to develop independent of our relations with other countries,"" Singh remarked. The two nations forged a strategic partnership in 2000 and have since been holding summits every year. ""Our talks have been comprehensive and result oriented. We have signed several important agreements covering a large number of sectors. This reflects our mutual desire to bring our cooperation in other areas at par with our traditionally strong cooperation in the defense and nuclear fields,"" Singh told reporters. Medvedev's trip to New Delhi follows similar trade-promoting visits by U.S. President Barack Obama, France's Nicolas Sarkozy and Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao.","Talks between Medvedev and Singh cover a range of issues .

"(CNN) -- An American school founder who young Haitian men once hailed as a savior was sentenced Tuesday to nearly 20 years in prison for sexually abusing them. Douglas Perlitz, 40, was sentenced in federal court in New Haven, Connecticut, to 19 years and 7 months behind bars for abusing the Haitian men when they were boys under his care, said Bruce Foucart, special agent in charge of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Office of Homeland Security Investigations in Boston. ""We're very pleased with the sentence,"" he said. ""He was brought to justice and I hope it sends a strong message to people who are doing that or who are even thinking about doing that."" Judge Janet Bond Arterton imposed the sentence, which includes 10 years of supervised release. Perlitz arrived in the northern Haitian city of Cap-Haitien in 1997. There, he opened a charitable school called the Project Pierre Toussaint (PPT). He got homeless boys off the streets and gave them shelter, food and education. ""When I met Mr. Douglas, he appeared to us like Jesus Christ himself come to rescue us,"" said Francilien Jean-Charles, who was only 12 when he was plucked by Perlitz and brought to the school. Over the years, PPT grew into a 10-acre compound with dorms, classrooms and a soccer field. Perlitz frequently flew back to Fairfield, Connecticut, to raise money. According to court documents, from 2002 to 2008, donors gave more than $2 million to help care for the kids. Perlitz's alma mater, Fairfield University, awarded him an honorary degree in 2002 for helping homeless boys in Haiti. But Perlitz was hardly the man he appeared to be. ""I thanked God when I met Douglas,"" said Jean-Charles. ""But when things started to turn bad, I realized it would have been better if I never came to PPT."" Perlitz wore a watch that lit up and at night, he used it to seek out the boys, they said. Fredlin Legrand said he woke up to see Perlitz next to him. ""He gave me a pill that made me fall asleep and when I woke up, I found my pants covered in sperm,"" Legrand told CNN. Jean-Charles and a dozen other boys told CNN they were routinely raped by Perlitz for years. But they were afraid to speak out against the man who had been such a boon for the city. Finally, in 2007, some of the boys approached their teachers and other adults. No one believed what they were hearing. Brian Russell, a donor for the school, said Perlitz was a miracle maker, not a pedophile. ""There was no way that this man could have committed these things that people were accusing him of. It seemed utterly out of the realm of possibility,"" Russell said. ""There was too much goodness. The heart was too big."" The boys grew desperate. They painted graffiti on the outer walls of the school, most of which has been painted over. But one plea for help still exists: ""Welcome, Haitian National Police."" The police never came, but journalist Cyrus Sibert noticed the writing on the wall. ""I told the boys, I will go to the end with you,"" Sibert said. ""Are you ready?"" But even after Sibert aired his interviews with the boys, Haitian authorities and American donors still did not believe the accusations. It was only after an American volunteer at the school relayed accusations of older boys raping younger ones that red flags went up. Russell said the volunteer demanded from the headmaster that something be done immediately. His response was: ""Well, that's really hard because Douglas has been doing this for the last 10 years."" Russell felt broken, betrayed. ""I felt like all the money I had donated, the time that I had given, something that we had worked so hard for was gone."" In September 2009, U.S. ICE agents picked up the case and arrested Perlitz. He denied the accusations, but in August, Perlitz pleaded guilty to one count of traveling with the intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct. He also admitted to engaging in sexual conduct with eight minors. The defense requested a delay in sentencing, contending Haiti's January earthquake, cholera outbreak and election-related street violence made it impossible to thoroughly review the prosecution's claims against Perlitz. The court denied the request. In addition, the defense maintained that Perlitz himself was a victim of sexual abuse. According to a defense memorandum, while he was at Fairfield University, ""a priest began a relationship with Doug that ... ultimately took on a dark aspect, both physically and spiritually, that had a significant and long-lasting impact on him."" The prosecution quickly responded, saying: ""Perlitz's sexual abuse of minors, abuse which lasted for a decade or more, shows him to be nothing more than a wolf in sheep's clothing -- an American man who traveled to Haiti purporting to care for homeless children when in reality he preyed upon the desperation of these children so that he could sexually abuse them."" Some of the boys, now young men, were in court Tuesday for the sentencing. They faced the man who abused them for years and spoke about their experience, bringing a sense of reality to the courtroom, said Foucart. They testified about how afraid of Perlitz they were and how he threatened to throw them out of the school and back on the streets if they spoke up. Paul Kendrick, an advocate for victims of abuse familiar with the case, was in court. He said Perlitz apologized to his victims at one point during the proceeding. ""The judge, I thought, gave a very strong sentence and a very strong message,"" said Kendrick. ""American citizens will be held accountable for their actions with minors no matter where they are in the world."" Watch Anderson Cooper 360° weeknights 10pm ET.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A key member of an insurgent network in the Afghan-Pakistani region has been seized recent days, Pakistani military intelligence sources told CNN on Friday. He is Nasiruddin Haqqani, son of Afghan insurgent leader Jalaluddin Haqqani, whose notorious group, called the Haqqani Network, operates in Afghanistan and Pakistan and is closely tied to the Taliban. Nasiruddin Haqqani was detained in recent days while driving from Peshawar to the tribal region of North Waziristan, the sources said. The United Nations says he is believed to be based out of Miram Shah in North Waziristan, where the network operates. The Pakistani military intelligence sources asked not to be named because they are not authorized to speak to the media. This arrest comes amid concerns among U.S. officials that Pakistan has not been aggressively confronting militants operating in the tribal regions. The Haqqani Network ""has been at the forefront of insurgent activity in Afghanistan, responsible for many high-profile attacks,"" the United Nations says. Bill Roggio, managing editor of The Long War Journal, a website that tracks terror-related events and trends, calls the top leadership a ""family business."" The United Nations says it consists of Jalaluddin Haqqani's three oldest sons, one of whom is Nasiruddin, who operates as an emissary for the network and spends a lot of time fundraising, the United Nations says. He apparently speaks Arabic and is a close aide to his father, the United Nations says. His brother, Sirajuddin, is described by the U.S. Treasury Department as the overall leader of the network and the leader of the Miram Shah Regional Military Shura. The United Nations says the Haqqani Network is believed to have three main sources of funds: Gulf region donations, drug trafficking, and al Qaeda payments. ""In 2004, (Nasiruddin) Haqqani traveled to Saudi Arabia with a Taliban associate to raise funds for the Taliban. He also provided funds in 2004 to militants in Afghanistan for the purpose of disrupting the Afghan presidential election. ""From at least 2005 to 2008, Nasiruddin Haqqani collected funds for the Haqqani Network through various fundraising trips, including during regular travel to the United Arab Emirates in 2007 and through a fundraising trip to another Gulf state in 2008,"" the United Nations said. And late last year, Nasiruddin Haqqani ""received several hundred thousand dollars from al Qaeda-associated individuals in the Arabian Peninsula"" for network activities. Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of the Treasury cited Nasiruddin Haqqani for supporting acts of terrorism. Sirajuddin Haqqani was designated a supporter of terrorism in 2008. Many observers say the North Waziristan-based group has backing in the Pakistani military. ""Elements within the Pakistani security establishment continue to view the Haqqani Network as a useful ally and proxy force to represent their interests in Afghanistan. To this end, Haqqani forces have repeatedly targeted Indian infrastructure and construction projects in Afghanistan,"" the Institute for the Study of War said in a report this year. ""The Pakistani Army has consistently refused to launch a military operation in North Waziristan despite the presence of al Qaeda senior leadership,"" it said. A report published earlier this year by the New America Foundation think tank calls the Pakistani agency of North Waziristan ""the most important springboard for violence in Afghanistan today, much as it has been for decades."" And it says the Haqqani Network is ""the most important militant group"" in North Waziristan's Miram Shah, where Jalaluddin Haqqani settled in the mid-1970s after leaving his native Khost province in Afghanistan. ""Jalaluddin quickly became the most important mujahedeen commander in eastern Afghanistan during the 1980s"" when Afghan fighters took on the Soviet Union, the report says. North Waziristan has been a ""safe haven"" for militants eluding U.S. and Pakistani military actions, it notes. ""Shortly after the fall of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan in late 2001, thousands of Taliban members associated with the regime flooded into North Waziristan,"" according to the report, titled ""The Battle for Pakistan: North Waziristan."" ""Many took shelter in (North Waziristan's) treacherous and heavily forested Shawal Valley, which became a refuge for all sorts of foreign militants, including those from al Qaeda. Pakistani government forces subsequently targeted other Pakistani safe havens, including South Waziristan. In 2004, a wave of militants arrived in North Waziristan after being pushed out of South Waziristan's Shakai Valley. More recently, a variety of militants associated with the Mehsud tribe in South Waziristan is believed to have sought safe haven in North Waziristan."" Will the arrest make an impact in the war against the Taliban? Roggio doubts it. He says the Haqqanis are one of the Pakistani state's premier proxies and puts them on par with Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, the Pakistan-based group that was blamed for a violent siege on Mumbai in November 2008. He notes that there has been pressure to appease and deflect pressure from the United States and NATO. ""When the heat gets turned up,"" he said, Pakistan will make a gesture but ""not a real sacrifice.""

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan arrested two senior police officials Wednesday in connection with the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. A court refused bail for the two officials, Saud Aziz and Khurram Shehzad, said special public prosecutor Chaudhary Zulfiqar Ali. Aziz was the police chief in the Rawalpindi district at the time of Bhutto's assassination while Shehzad was the head of her security team. The two have been accused of security breaches, covering up evidence by hosing down the crime scene and failing to conduct a post-mortem examination on Bhutto. Aziz and Shehzad said Bhutto's husband and the current president, Asif Ali Zardari, ordered them to not conduct the post-mortem. An audio of that request was played in court Wednesday. The court found the two men had failed their legal obligation as police. A United Nations panel looking into Bhutto's assassination concluded that Pakistan's military-led former government failed to adequately protect her and that intelligence agencies hindered the subsequent investigation. The panel's scathing report in April said the suicide bombing that killed Bhutto ""could have been prevented"" and that police deliberately failed to pursue an effective investigation into the killings. The government of Gen. Pervez Musharraf said Bhutto had been afforded adequate protection. Bhutto had returned from a self-imposed, eight-year exile to run in the country's general elections in 2007. She escaped one attempt on her life but was killed on December 27 by a 15-year-old suicide bomber while campaigning in Rawalpindi, the seat of Pakistan's military. ""No one believes that this boy acted alone,"" the U.N. report said. ""A range of government officials failed profoundly in their efforts first to protect Ms. Bhutto, and second to investigate with vigor all those responsible for her murder, not only in the execution of the attack, but also in its conception, planning and financing."" The two police officials are scheduled to appear for a hearing January 7. CNN's Nasir Habib contributed to this report.","Two police officials are accused of security breaches and covering up evidence .

"Washington (CNN) -- When President Obama signed the bill repealing the so-called ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy, it did not immediately end the military's 17-year ban on gays serving openly. In fact, it will take a series of actions to make that happen, and no one at the Pentagon seems to know when the actual end date might be. ""I don't think anybody has any idea how long this will take,"" Pentagon press secretary Geoff Morrell told reporters Monday. Even gays currently serving, albeit quietly, had muted reactions to the Senate's vote to end the ban. Three such service members, speaking to CNN on the condition we wouldn't use their real names, all used the word ""relief"" when asked about the repeal. Obama signs 'don't, ask' repeal . Before the ban is completely lifted, the president, the secretary of defense and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff will have to certify that the repeal can move ahead without negatively affecting unit cohesion and military readiness. And before that can happen, the Department of Defense will have to go through countless regulations and rules to see if they need to be changed to reflect the end of the ban. Clifford Stanley, the undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness, will oversee that part of the process, with input from the individual services. He and his staff will be ""reviewing and revising policies, directives, establishing the education and training materials, developing communication plans on how we are going to communicate with the force."" That's where the mystery begins as far as the timing. ""I can't put any kind of a timeline on it,"" Col. David Lapan, a Pentagon spokesman, said. """"We plan to move out carefully, deliberately and purposefully to implement it, but right now we are in the planning stages and I don't have any specifics for you."" The closest Lapan would come to predicting how long the ban might remain in effect was when he said the process ""would not be slow-rolled."" So far, Defense Secretary Robert Gates, who is famous for setting hard deadlines and demanding that his subordinates meet them, has set no deadline for completion of this process. Part of the problem is that so little has been done so far. The Pentagon released an 87-page ""Support Plan for Implementation"" of the DADT repeal. It spells out how the Pentagon should handle a myriad of issues raised by the repeal, including: . • ""prohibit the creation of separate bathroom and shower facilities based on sexual orientation""; . • ""prohibit berthing or billeting (housing) assignments based on sexual orientation""; . • ""no new procedures will be developed for the early separation of Service members based on opposition to repeal or to serving and living with gay and lesbian Service members."" But the plan is all recommendations -- nothing is set in stone. Even if each recommendation is accepted, there are few details in the plan and they'd all need to be worked out. Even after Stanley finishes his portion of the process and the president, secretary and chairman certify it, the repeal still doesn't become law. Another 60 days must pass before the repeal is official. Only then can a homosexual serve openly without fear of being discharged. One gay active-duty service member said getting it all done quickly is important. ""The longer we drag this out, the more confused we get, and the more lack of clarity we have and the messier the situation happens,"" said ""JD Smith"" a military officer who is also a leader of OutServe, an advocacy group for gay troops. The gay service members that CNN spoke to said when that day comes, don't expect anything dramatic. ""It's like Y2K. Everyone is making such a big deal out of it, but the next day ... everyone's going to  be like, oh, this wasn't a big deal at all,"" ""Smith"" said. ""John"" is a naval officer. ""I don't have any big plans to come out now, and I think I probably speak for a lot of other service members in my same position. There's not going to be a huge rush to make big announcements just because the Senate has passed this law,"" he said. ""William"" is an Air Force staff sergeant based in Germany. ""I will be reserved about the subject, because I don't think the military needs to be in my personal life."" While the three men said the repeal of DADT won't have much short-term impact on their lives, they all agreed that in the long run, they'll likely stay in the military longer. ""Had this law not passed, I was seriously considering being done with the military. It's very hard to live under this policy,"" ""Smith"" said. ""I was not going to re-enlist unless this policy was taken away; now I have an open path. I love the military. I will definitely re-enlist."" Earlier this year, a Washington think tank invited military officers from countries that have long allowed gays to serve openly. Several of those officers said their countries adopted their rules almost overnight with no adverse effects. They recommended that the U.S. do the same. But that won't be the case. It will be months, at least, before gays can serve openly in the U.S. military. By then it's possible Gates will no longer be leading the Pentagon. He's already said he plans to retire next year, and Morrell said he doesn't know if Gates plans to stay until the process is complete.","No one in the Pentagon seems to know how long it will take to enact repeal .

"(CNN) -- Mardy Fish has criticized tennis authorities for halving the suspension handed out to fellow American player Wayne Odesnik for importing controlled drugs. Odesnik will be able to resume his career from December 29 after the International Tennis Federation conditionally canceled the second year of his ban following his cooperation with anti-doping officials. The 25-year-old pleaded guilty to importing human growth hormone into Australia at the start of last year, but is now free to play again when the 2011 season begins Down Under next month. The ITF said he had provided ""substantial assistance"" to its anti-doping program, and that his requirement to do so is ""ongoing."" Fish described the ITF's decision as ""a black eye for all of sport, not just tennis,"" in quotes reported by U.S. newspaper USA Today. ""He's a good player on enhanced substances. Let's see if he can be a good player without them,"" the world No. 16 said. Odesnik, who was born in South Africa but moved to the United States when young, has slipped from a career-high 77th to completely off the ATP Tour's rankings list. ""I am thrilled that I can return to the game and compete in the sport about which I am truly passionate. I have learned a lot during my time away from competitive tennis and I now have even a greater appreciation for what a privilege it is to be a professional athlete,"" Odesnik said in a statement. ""I want to take this opportunity to thank my family, true close friends and fans who have stood by me during this difficult time. I am deeply grateful and humbled by your support.""","Mardy Fish describe's ITF's decision on Wayne Odesnik as ""a black eye for all sport""

"(EW.com) -- ""The Next Three Days"" follows an ordinary guy named John (Russell Crowe) as he executes a wildly complicated plan to spring his wife, Lara (Elizabeth Banks,) from prison, where she has been locked up for a murder she says she didn't commit. Jailbreaking is not John's forte --he's a community-college professor in Pittsburgh and he drives a Prius. But all judicial appeals have failed, and the couple's young son is so very sad. So, spurred by love, despair, and belief in his wife's innocence, John turns to desperate measures. First, however, he does some Internet homework that leads him to Damon (Liam Neeson,) an ex-con-turned-author who provides expert advice on the art of escape. Damon's how-to-break-the-law lesson -- as ludicrous as anything else in this enjoyably zigzaggy exercise in accumulating peril -- grants Neeson the fun of experimenting with an American ex-con accent for his one scene. It also sets up the movie's real strength, which is generating escalating waves of plot tension and misdirection as John, heeding advice, makes his jail-busting moves. Writer-director Paul Haggis (""Crash,"") who adapted ""The Next Three Days"" from a 2008 French thriller, ""Pour Elle,"" clearly has Alfred Hitchcock's wrong-man-in-wrong-place psychological archetype in mind as John weaves all over Pittsburgh. Lara, for her part, has no idea of her husband's plan -- the usually sunnier Banks is an interesting, counterintuitive casting choice -- and when she finds out, she adds her own complications. Soon the chase becomes its own perpetual-motion machine, one that ticks down to the last second. With cops closing in, there's passport forgery, robbery, lock picking, shooting, and driving too fast while behind the wheel of a Prius. There's also a bit of tampering with medical records, the inevitable follow-up to Lara's demonstration in Act 1, Scene 1 that she's diabetic. Throughout, Crowe marshals his unique physical gravitas -- his way of speaking with his eyes while remaining very still and quiet -- to bolster Haggis' more sentimental premise that the character represents any average John who loves his family deeply enough to declare, Screw the system! We're outta here! While Crowe throws his serious weight behind the notion of a man angry, weary, and bereft enough of his ordinary life to take drastic steps, the movie throws obstacle after obstacle his way and says to the audience: Oh, he squeaked through that?

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- The sham marriage trial of Mexican actress Fernanda Romero, under way in a Los Angeles federal court, offered more drama this week than the soap operas she is famous for. The courtroom cast included celebrity photographer and reality TV star Markus Klinko, whom defense lawyers tried to paint as a revengeful ex-boyfriend who turned her in to immigrations agents. Romero sat directly in front of jurors, holding hands with co-defendant Kent Ross, the Los Angeles musician she allegedly paid $5,000 to marry her so she could get a U.S. work visa. The couple had an ""unconventional relationship,"" but their marriage was real, a defense lawyer said in opening statements. The 28-year-old actress-model began sobbing as Klinko testified against her Wednesday, outlining his romantic relationship with Romero that he said began after she married Ross. The judge scowled several times as the lead defense attorney questioned Klinko about areas already ruled irrelevant to the case. ""Please, don't do that,"" U.S. District Judge Manuel Real warned defense lawyer Michael Nasatir. Real's rulings frustrated defense efforts to press Klinko about why he hired the private investigator who dug up the evidence that prompted immigration agents to begin their probe of Romero's marriage. Klinko testified that it was ""completely incorrect"" that his motivation was to get his former girlfriend deported. Instead, the investigator was gathering evidence to be used in a lawsuit against Michael Ball, the founder and owner of the Rock & Republic fashion company, Klinko said. The criminal complaint named Ball as a target of the federal investigation, alleging that he helped arrange the sham marriage while Romero was modeling for his company. Klinko said his lawyer turned the evidence over to the government only because he feared Klinko might by extorted by Ball. ""My case has never been against Fernanda,"" Klinko said after his testimony. ""I wish her the best."" The judge also rejected the defense attempt to allege that Klinko, a Swiss native, was himself involved in a sham marriage in 1987 -- a charge he denied outside court. ""The defense attempted over and over again to taint Mr. Klinko with malicious and false smears,"" said Klinko's lawyer, Lisa Bloom. ""The judge repeatedly blocked them from doing so by sustaining multiple objections to their improper questions. We thank the judge."" The prosecutor in the case, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jim Left, said Romero could get between 15 and 21 months in prison if convicted, though such cases usually produce shorter sentences. The case is unusual because marriage fraud charges are usually litigated by immigration authorities rather than prosecuted as criminal cases. The federal complaint accuses Romero of paying Ross, 28, to marry her June 12, 2005, but alleges that they never lived together as a couple. Romero began dating Klinko a month later, and they lived together for several months, the complaint says. According to a sworn affidavit by Immigration and Customs Enforcement Senior Special Agent Bonita Canterberry filed in the case, Klinko and Romero's relationship ended in 2007, about the same time Klinko filed a lawsuit against Rock & Republic and Ball, alleging breach of contract in relation to a photo shoot. Klinko also accused Ball of extortion. Romero's show business career began in Mexico at age 16 when she joined the ensemble Frizzby, her Internet Movie Database biography says. The group toured Mexico and Central America, releasing two top-10 singles, it says. She started hosting television shows and appearing on commercials in Mexico when she was 18, it says. Romero has appeared in print and TV ad campaigns for Rock and Republic, Clean and Clear, Pepsi, Apple and JC Penney, it says. ""She was cast in Telemundo's original production 'Wounded Soul,' where she was not only a lead actress, but also a lead singer, performing two songs in the soap opera's soundtrack,"" her online biography says.","Defense: Fernanda Romero's marriage was ""unconventional"" but real .

"(CNN) -- No one can deny that these are difficult days. Ireland this week became the second Eurozone nation in six months to be bailed out by the International Monetary Fund. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development predicted a slowing down of economic recovery through 2011, with more turbulence ahead if ""global imbalances"" and high levels of sovereign debt are not brought under control. As currency speculators hover in search of easy pickings, Western nations rush to impose self-styled ""austerity measures."" No one wants to be the next economic basket case. Let's cross our fingers and pray to the gods that we escape the luck of the Irish. The temptation for national governments to panic and retrench is powerful. But the instinct is misguided and damagingly regressive. Even the language of austerity, with its overtones of punishment, is painfully wrong. And the pain is inflicted first and foremost on the public sector -- where spending cuts abound and job losses are rife -- and on the poorest in society. Frontline services evaporate and the most deprived communities are left hanging out to dry. Austerity comes from the Greek verb ""to dry."" It is sour and astringent. Self-flagellation is the order of the day. TED.com: Bjorn Lomborg sets global priorities . Some at least of this new austerity is a form of ideological revenge. The UK is a striking case in point. Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne smiled all the way to the dispatches box as he delivered plans to cut the UK deficit to nothing in the space of five years. His was the moral high ground. The finger of blame was pointed clearly at his predecessors who had been ""profligate"" with the nation's resources and built an ""overblown"" public sector. It's a tempting and convenient narrative. But it's also profoundly inaccurate and a damaging basis for economic renewal. The first casualty in party warfare is a sense of perspective. For all his failings, one of Gordon Brown's most significant achievements as chancellor from 1997 to 2007 was to bring the national debt down below 40 percent of the gross domestic product and keep it there consistently for the longest period in UK history since World War I. That is, until the crisis struck -- and then all hell broke loose. Public sector spending, having been stable in relative terms for decades, leapt from 40 percent to 50 percent of the GDP. The public deficit approached 12 percent of the GDP and the sovereign debt is set to double -- all in the space of a few short years. Amidst the ideological bloodletting, the architecture of the crisis has been conveniently forgotten. This was not a crisis born from rampant socialism, but from unbridled capitalism. What collapsed was not the internal viability of the social economy but the structural integrity of capital markets. And the biggest casualty of all has been our ability to invest meaningfully in the future. When the language is all about spending cuts, the mere mention of investment in public goods is seen as heretical. And one of the most vital tenets of economics -- that our future welfare depends on the services provided by capital assets -- is left waving in the ideological wind. For one brief moment during early 2009, the political rhetoric around stimulus lingered tantalizingly on the need to invest in transition -- away from a carbon-intensive, fossil-fueled economy and toward a sustainable, green society. We missed the chance to take that opportunity seriously. TED.com: John Hardy's green school dream . What we cannot afford to do now is to erase the lessons of the global financial crash from our minds in our desire to avoid a visit from the IMF. In fact, it is we who should pay a visit to the IMF. A global institution which has failed to protect global capitalism from itself is no longer fit for its purpose. Imposing austerity as a means to revive business as usual is a moribund strategy. If institutional reform is the order of the day, then the transformation of the IMF may not be a bad starting point. But beyond such reform, where should we turn for inspiration and renewal? This is where frugality comes in. Austerity is all about cutting back the public sector in an attempt to reinvigorate the private sector. Frugality is about shifting our attention, and our income, away from restless consumption and toward long-term saving. Spending less, yes, but investing more -- both in the public and the private sphere. And in our rush to rebuild financial markets, we need to pause long enough to make them fit for the purpose. Investing responsibly in social and ecological assets is the key design criterion. Creating robust vehicles to direct public and private savings toward long-term investment in low carbon technologies and infrastructures, in resource productivity, in social goods and public spaces, in land and water and ecosystem services -- here is the cornerstone for economic renewal. TED.com: Saving the ocean one island at a time . Government must guide and lead this transition. This is not a time to dismantle the state. By all means let's question again the boundaries between the private and the public sectors. Let's explore new models of ownership and enterprise. Let's question the role of productivity and the meaning of welfare. Let's revisit the concept and function of public goods. But for goodness' sake, let's leave sufficient governance in place to have a decent chance at a new prosperity. Frugality comes from the Latin. It speaks of bearing fruit. Of our ability to flourish, not through relentless material profligacy, but through a due attention to season and cycle and the processes of maturation. Austerity presents us with an arid world, stripped bare of meaning, devoid of hope. Frugality offers us a way to re-enchant the future. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tim Jackson.","Tim Jackson: Nations are hoping to avoid bailouts like those of Greece, Ireland .
He says there's a rush to embrace austerity measures that inflict pain on the poor .

"(CNET)  -- For Stanford University student Feross Aboukhadijeh, what started off as a bet fueled by youthful ambition and technical bravado, ended up an Internet hit and quite possibly a job. Last week, Aboukhadijeh, 19, was just an ordinary, albeit talented, college student as he tested out Google Instant, the Web giant's new predictive search results feature. He was immediately impressed on its debut Wednesday but also inspired. To his roommate, he said, ""I bet you I can build YouTube Instant in an hour."" And his roommate took him up on the bet. Aboukhadijeh didn't quite make the hour deadline, but three hours later, YouTube Instant was born. The site lets people search the enormous YouTube video database in real time. He spent a couple more hours Thursday sprucing up the user interface. And before going to sleep that night, he posted his work to his Facebook page. ""When I woke up Friday morning there was craziness,"" he said. By ""craziness,"" Aboukhadijeh means countless e-mails congratulating him, a bevy of interview requests, a server flooded with Web traffic, the creation of a Wikipedia entry in his name, and -- perhaps most notably -- a job offer from YouTube CEO Chad Hurley via Twitter. Unsure just how seriously to take the tweeted job offer, Aboukhadijeh replied along the lines of ""Is this a for-real offer?"" Hurley then e-mailed him to set up a meeting, which is scheduled for Monday at YouTube's San Bruno, Calif., headquarters, Aboukhadijeh said. YouTube officials didn't respond to an e-mail request sent Friday from CNET seeking confirmation of the job offer or meeting. Aboukhadijeh is just finishing up a summer internship with Facebook, but he doesn't see how that would prohibit his taking a job at YouTube, which is owned by Google. ""I'd like to finish college,"" he added, which he agreed could pose the bigger problem. Much like Google Instant, YouTube Instant lets people type in what they're looking for, and the engine guesses what that video is. By design, it plays the video immediately. However, based on feedback, Aboukhadijeh said he's working on play and pause features, among other improvements. ""It's not as useful as Google Instant if you know exactly what you're looking for, since you're shown distracting YouTube videos on the way to your destination,"" Aboukhadijeh told All Thing Digital's Peter Kafka. ""But I think this is perfect for many Internet users."" He built the site using the YouTube API but scraped YouTube search suggestions after Google blocked his server for making too many repeated requests to the search suggestion endpoint. Aboukhadijeh ended up re-writing the site to instead query YouTube directly for search suggestions, ""eliminating the round-trip to my server,"" he said. Aboukhadijeh, who is from Sacramento, California, said he's been blown away by how quickly his tool went viral and is grateful for all the supportive feedback. ""I'm amazed and humbled by all the attention it's received. So thank you,"" he said. But imitation is the highest form of flattery, and it appears he's got that, too. TechCrunch on Saturday pointed to Alabama-based developer Michael Hart, who, inspired by Aboukhadijeh, used jQuery and the Google Maps API to build Google Maps Instant. And the same blogger later pointed to an all-encompassing Instantise page that gives a home to the evidently quickly growing number of sites with instant, predictive search results. Instantise was reportedly designed by Scottish engineer Tam Denholm, TechCrunch said. Aboukhadijeh is a majoring in computer science, but his technical expertise has been developing over many years. Around age 5, when his parents bought a new microwave oven, he took the manual and learned how to turn on the child lock, something his parents never learned to do. That knowledge came in handy when he was old enough to get grounded -- he would lock it up and use it as a bargaining chip. © 2010 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved.

"(RealSimple.com) -- Readers share the uncustomary customs they celebrate year after year. Since we moved to Virginia four years ago, my husband and I have attended the annual National Menorah Lighting on the Ellipse, in Washington, D.C. A military band accompanies three cantors while they give the blessing and sing, and latkes and sufganiyot (a type of doughnut often enjoyed on Hanukkah) are served. Afterward we go to our favorite Mediterranean restaurant. I am pregnant with twins due this month, and I can't wait to share this tradition with them. -- Cyndi Alderson, Oak Hill, Virginia . RealSimple.com: Holiday celebrations around the world . When my two siblings and I were very young, our nana started the tradition of hiding a small plastic bird in our Christmas tree (it was notable for the Band-Aid on its left leg, courtesy of a run-in with the family dog). The three of us would search high and low to find the bird, which was supposed to bring the finder luck in the coming year. Once we were adults, our mom wanted us to continue the ritual with our own families, so she gave each of us a replica of a red cardinal. And ever since we've enjoyed watching the next generation search for these birds. -- Beth Britton, New York, New York . A marshmallow fight. It always happens after dinner on Christmas Eve, and usually one of my cousins starts it. Everyone joins in, from the toddlers to the grandparents, until someone waves the white flag. -- Jessica P. Sanchez, La Mirada, California . During Hanukkah, we do a Yankee swap, a gift exchange. It has always been great fun, but a few years ago my husband and I decided to make it even more interesting by sneaking decoy gifts into the mix. They look like normal presents from the outside -- we wrap up things like CD cases, gift-card envelopes, and wine bottles -- but once you look inside, you see that the original item has been replaced with a note card bearing an instruction, such as ""Switch gifts with a person of the opposite gender"" or ""Choose a new gift -- and no one can take it from you."" This little twist was a surprise to everyone the first year, but now it is our favorite part of the ritual. -- Christine Gritmon, Pearl River, New York . Every December, my friends and I visit a nearby resort that hosts a holiday gnome hunt. Twenty of these white-bearded men, which range from 6 to 12 inches tall, are hidden throughout a giant atrium. Our group of 12 splits into teams of three, and we give ourselves a two-hour time limit to scavenge for the gnomes. The folks who find the largest number of them win free ice cream or hot chocolate, depending on the weather that night. -- Alicia Carby, Orlando, Florida . RealSimple.com: Readers' recipes from their family ktchens . While we decorate the tree, our family devours a spread of doughnuts and Champagne. We always save the wire cage from the top of the bottle, write the year underneath the cap with a permanent marker, then affix the cage to a high branch. My husband and I have done this since we got married, nearly three decades ago, so this year there will be 27 Champagne cages adorning our tree. They are unusual, to say the least, and add a fun pop of color. -- Evelyn Cucchiara, Madison, New Jersey . One tradition that my clan adopted from our hometown of Maracaibo, Venezuela -- in fact, it's common in several Latin American countries -- is to wear a new pair of yellow underpants on New Year's Eve and into the following day. It's supposed to bring good luck. My husband, who is American, was amused to hear of this custom when I told him about it back in 2006. Later that same day, he came home with two pairs of underwear: Mine were simply yellow, but he could find only a pair of SpongeBob Square-pants boxers for himself. Two pairs of lucky underwear now top our holiday shopping lists every year. -- Natalia Gustafson, Baton Rouge, Louisiana . After a few glasses of wine on Christmas Eve, my family and friends play Name That Tune using my late mother's collection of wooden nutcrackers. The rules are simple: You ""crack"" out the song using the jaw's lever, and the group has to guess what it is. Christmas carols are typically easy to identify -- I can pull off a mean version of ""Jingle Bell Rock"" -- but opera, which was my mom's favorite, and blues, my uncle's music of choice, are nearly impossible to recognize. -- Marybeth Kass, Holyoke, Massachusetts . Our tree is covered with mementos instead of ornaments. We have key chains from trips (Germany, the Grand Canyon); my grandmother's credit cards from high-end stores, like Harrods in London; and the hook my brother wore when he played Captain Hook in second grade -- all of which are hung with green ribbon. During the year, we keep the more fragile items (origami swans, napkins with funny quotes scribbled on them, business cards) pressed between the pages of a Life magazine from the 1960s, which is when my parents started this tradition. Flipping through that magazine is a beloved part of the occasion now, too. -- Genna Hinkle, Saratoga Springs, New York . Our New Year's Eve would not be complete without bagna cauda, a southern Italian dip. Its literal translation is ""hot bath."" To make it, you combine anchovies, tuna, garlic, and heavy cream in a sizzling skillet. (A word of warning: The overpowering smell may ward off some guests.) Still, we believe, as the Italians of Calabria do, that you must consume at least one cabbage leaf soaked in it or your luck in the coming year may be jeopardized. -- Anne Johnson, Prior Lake, Minnesota . RealSimple.com: How do you make holiday entertaining less stressful? I trace my kids' hands on our red flannel tree skirt with fabric-paint pens and also include their ages. I have been doing this for the past seven years. My boys, ages 13 and 11, have loved witnessing how their hands have grown. The skirt is now half-full. Someday we'll add their spouses' handprints, or just wait for their children to be born. -- Rebecca Wheat Townsend, Abilene, Texas . We collect dry milkweed pods in the fall. Then we open them during the holidays and blow the fluffy white seeds all over our tree. It looks like snow on the branches. -- Vicki Ann Shannon, Marshall, Missouri . At midnight on New Year's Eve, our family and friends join us to bang on the light post in front of our home. Using hammers and wrenches, we hit the post for about two minutes straight while shouting, ""Happy New Year!"" Hopefully, we don't drive the neighbors crazy. -- Lorrie Kellerman-Fullmer, Anthem, Arizona . Our tradition is eating plum pudding and hard sauce, which is a topping made of butter, sugar, and alcohol. While my sisters and I were growing up, my Irish mother always bought a particular brand of pudding. When the company stopped making it, we tried other versions, but nothing tasted right to us. Mom experimented until she came up with a recipe that was reminiscent of the original. Nowadays, we live far apart from one another, but one thing we all do during the holidays is whip up her matchless holiday treat. -- Maura Diehl, Orefield, Pennsylvania . Every January, my family cuts the base off the Christmas tree in order to display it in a glass-topped coffee table. It's a long process: To keep the wood from rotting, we dry it out for several months, then coat the entire thing in polyurethane. We then use rub-on numbers to mark the year.

"CIANJUR, Indonesia (CNN)  -- More than a day after a major earthquake jolted Indonesia's Java Island, killing at least 57 people, there is still no word from remote villages along the coast, a relief worker told CNN Thursday. Soldiers try to dig out the body of a victim buried by a landslide caused by the earthquake.

""Until now the Indonesian government is still able to handle it by itself using existing national resources,"" he said, according to Antara. Rescuers in Cianjur used their hands and rudimentary tools to try to pry away the rocks, some that were bigger than cars. No heavy machinery could be brought in to help in the rescue effort because many roads in the area were blocked.

"(CNN) -- Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris was rebounding Saturday after hundreds of flights were canceled because of a shortage of de-icing fluid during snow and ice that snarled air traffic across Europe, authorities said. Flight delays at de Gaulle were expected to decrease as the day went on. Officials could not give an exact number of flight cancellations. The weather improved Saturday and shipments of de-icing fluid from Charlotte, North Carolina, and Germany, will help alleviate future problems, officials said. Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, minister for transportation and ecology, said she wants more information on the fluid shortage. About 300 people who spent the night at the airport were provided with food and blankets, officials said. Transport ministry official Thierry Mariani paid them a visit and volunteers provided stuff animals for children and gifts of chocolate. Some passengers and others were critical of what happened at de Gaulle, but officials blamed the situation largely on the weather. Air France CEO Pierre-Henri Gourgeoan told the news agency AFP the airline had not been informed of the problems. ""It is surprising and somewhat [impermissible] that an airport such as Roissy Charles de Gaulle could experience such a supply problem. It is an isolated case in Europe,"" said Gourgeoan. Meanwhile, the Brussels, Belgium, airport reported that operations were nearly back to normal Saturday, with two of three runways operational. Gatwick Airport and Heathrow Airports in London said airlines were operating, but some delays or cancellations were possible. Airports across Europe are still struggling to get passengers to their destinations after they were snarled by unexpected snow over the weekend. Nearly 2,000 passengers at de Gaulle were moved from Terminal 2E to other parts of the airport on Friday because of the weight of snow on a roof, French authorities said, calling the measure ""preventative."" Part of the roof of that terminal collapsed in 2004, shortly after the state-of-the-art building was inaugurated. Four people were killed, media reports at the time said. About a foot of snow had fallen on the roof Friday by the time authorities decided to close the terminal, French media reports said. French authorities earlier Friday asked airlines to cancel half their morning flights to and from the airport because the de-icing fluid was running low. That led to the cancellation of 400 flights Friday morning -- 200 arrivals and 200 departures. Then, early in the afternoon, authorities asked airlines to scrap a third of their flights for the rest of the day. Charles de Gaulle is the second busiest airport in Europe, after Heathrow in London. Paris' second airport, Orly, has not had to cancel flights because it is not running out of glycol, which is using for de-icing, authorities said. CNN's Niki Cook and Per Nyberg contributed to this report.","NEW: Officials will investigate de-icing fluid shortage .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Afghan and NATO troops killed 10 insurgents during separate sweeps in southern and eastern Afghanistan, NATO's International Security Assistance Force said Monday. ISAF said coalition troops spotted insurgents placing an improvised explosive device in the Musa Qal'ah district of Helmand province and killed several with small arms fire. In the Tagab district of Kapisa province, ISAF said a combined patrol of coalition and Afghan forces came under fire from insurgents. The patrol returned fire, killing and wounding what ISAF described as ""numerous"" insurgents. ISAF also said separate patrols found a number of weapons, ammunition and explosive components in caches located in eastern and southern Afghanistan. Meanwhile, one person died and 26 were injured when a car bomb exploded Monday as police were picking up their paychecks in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar, authorities said. The bomb detonated in a Toyota Corolla about 500 meters (1,640 feet) from Kabul Bank, a police security director there said. The Kandahar Government Media and Information Center said the injured included 16 police and 10 civilians.

"(CNN) -- Ecuador is the latest country to recognize an independent Palestinian state. The government said on Friday that President Rafael Correa recognized ""the Palestine State as free and independent within its borders since 1967."" Others countries -- such as Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay -- recently made the same move. These diplomatic initiatives come after the breakdown of direct peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians. Palestinians have been seeking international recognition of an independent state, a strategy to achieve statehood outside the framework of talks with Israel. ""Sadly, the Middle East continues to face wars and violent events that have led to the death of many innocent people, a situation contrary to the humane and pacifist position established by the Ecuadorian Constitution. This recognition is meant to reinforce the valid and legitimate wish of the Palestine people to have their own free and independent state,"" the Ecuadorian government said. Ecuador said the acknowledgment of such a state has been legitimized by U.N. Security Council resolutions, numbers 242 and 338, and an Arab peace initiative adopted in the 2002 Beirut Summit. The recognition of an independent Palestine, the government said, ""will be fundamental to achieve the peaceful co-existence of the nations in the region through dialogue and mediation.""","Other South American nations recognized a Palestinian state .

"Washington (CNN) -- Russian President Dmitry Medvedev on Thursday congratulated President Barack Obama on the Senate's approval of a new nuclear arms control treaty between the countries, the White House said. According to a White House statement, the two presidents spoke by phone on the first day of Obama's Hawaiian holiday after Congress adjourned Wednesday in a flurry of legislative action, including the Senate vote to pass the treaty -- a major foreign policy objective of the Obama administration. ""President Obama and President Medvedev spoke by phone this morning to discuss the new START Treaty and their continued close cooperation on a range of critical issues,"" the White House statement said. ""President Medvedev congratulated President Obama on the Senate's approval of the new START Treaty, and the two leaders agreed that this was an historic event for both countries and for U.S.-Russia relations."" Obama cited issues of cooperation with Russia including Afghanistan, sanctions on Iran and World Trade Organization developments, the statement said. Obama added it was important for the two countries to work together ""to support a peaceful referendum in Sudan and a resolution to the impasse in Cote D'Ivoire (Ivory Coast) that respects the results of the recent democratic election,"" according to the statement. The New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or New START, was passed on a 71-26 Senate vote, with several Republicans joining a unified Democratic caucus in support of the accord. The treaty will bring resumed inspections of each country's nuclear arsenal while limiting both the United States and Russia to 1,550 warheads and 700 launchers. It still needs to be approved by the Russian parliament. Signed by Obama and Medvedev in April, the treaty is considered a critical component of nuclear non-proliferation efforts and the administration's attempt to ""reset"" Washington's relationship with Moscow. ""This is the most significant arms control agreement in nearly two decades,"" Obama said Wednesday after the Senate vote. It ""will enhance our leadership to stop the spread of nuclear weapons and seek the peace of a world without them."" Several senators were reassured by the last-minute passage of an amendment stating that the accord should not be interpreted in a way that would hamper U.S. missile defense plans. The amendment was sponsored by Republican senators John McCain of Arizona and Bob Corker of Tennessee, among others. Others said they had been assured of an administration commitment to modernize America's aging nuclear arsenal. ""The people of the world are watching us, because they rely on our leadership,"" said Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John Kerry, D-Massachusetts. It is time to ""move the world a little more out of the dark shadow of nuclear nightmare."" ""We are the leading nuclear power on this earth. It is our responsibility to lead,"" said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-North Dakota. This treaty is ""a step in the right direction."" Indiana Sen. Richard Lugar, the top Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, called it a step forward in terms of constraining ""expensive arms competition with Russia"" and frustrating ""rogue nations who would prefer as much distance as possible between the United States and Russia."" Not all Republicans were convinced of the treaty's merits, however. Sen. Jim DeMint, R-South Carolina, argued on the Senate floor that the basic premise of the treaty -- that America's nuclear arsenal should be at parity with Russia's -- is flawed. ""Russia is a protector of none and a threat to many. America is a protector of many and a threat to none,"" DeMint said. DeMint also voiced an ongoing conservative complaint in the lame-duck session -- that Democrats were ramming the treaty through as part of a long list of partisan priorities rejected by the public in the midterm elections. ""We should not be passing major legislation at this time of year with this Congress,"" he said. The arms pact is part of ""a continued effort of accommodation and appeasement"" that makes a ""mockery of the debate and ratification process."" Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Illinois, called the treaty ""an echo from the 20th century"" that fails to account for new and emerging threats. Kirk and several other senators expressed a fear that the treaty would weaken America's ability to prevent potential nuclear attacks from countries such as Iran and North Korea. McCain himself, despite passage of the amendment he sponsored, ultimately voted against the accord. He argued that it ""re-establishes an old and outdated linkage between nuclear arms and missile defense, which is no longer suited to the threats of today's world."" Passage of the treaty appeared to be in doubt for weeks. A late burst of support came Tuesday, however, after treaty supporters voted down or tabled several Republican amendments, saying they were unnecessary and would imperil the pact by reopening negotiated language or understandings with Russia. The defeated amendments included adding a reference to tactical nuclear weapons and a bid to remove from the preamble language recognizing a relationship between offensive and defensive weapons. An overwhelming majority of Americans support ratification of the treaty, according to a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll released Tuesday: 73 percent of people questioned in the national poll said the Senate should approve the accord, while 24 percent said senators should reject it. CNN's Alan Silverleib, Tom Cohen, Dana Bash, Ted Barrett and Lesa Jansen contributed to this report.","The two presidents spoke by phone on Thursday .

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- After eight months of bickering and political paralysis, Iraqi leaders were thought to have finally reached a power-sharing agreement Thursday for a new government, but that deal appeared to fall apart late in the day as members of the Sunni-backed Iraqiya List walked out of the parliamentary session. Jalal Talabani, sworn in late Thursday for a second term as president, delegated Shiite Prime Minister Nuril al-Maliki to form a government within 30 days, as mandated by the constitution. Thursday's session then adjourned until Saturday. Quarreling that has typified Iraq's gridlock re-emerged during the parliamentary session, from which most members of the Sunni-backed Iraqiya bloc walked out saying that the other political blocs were not adhering to their promise to vote on the tentative power-sharing agreement, which had been reached late Wednesday. The Iraqiya List had wanted parliament to vote on that agreement before voting for a president in order to ensure guarantees that had been promised to the Sunnis were in fact delivered. In the past, politicians have made promises to Sunnis that have not materialized, resulting in a widespread lack of trust. Politicians had cobbled out a compromise Wednesday that would have left Maliki in power and created a powerful new office that was expected to be headed by his rival, former Prime Minister Ayad Allawi, lawmakers said Thursday. Under the proposed deal, the three major governmental positions were to have been filled by three members of the country's largest ethnic groups -- the Shiites, the Kurds and the Sunni Arabs. Al-Maliki is Shia. Jalal Talabani, who was to remain as president, is Kurdish. Lawmakers on Thursday elected Osama al-Nujaifi, a Sunni Arab from the Iraqiya bloc, to be the parliament speaker. They also chose Qusay al-Suhail, a lawmaker from the hard-line Shiite Sadrists, to be first deputy speaker and Aref Tayfoor, who is Kurdish, as the second deputy. But Sunnis did not consider Nujaifi to be adequate representation, and many members of the Iraqiya bloc walked out when parliament didn't accept its demand for a vote on the actual power-sharing agreement. Shiite lawmakers said the vote couldn't be taken because it was not on the agenda, but Allawi disputed this. Even al-Nujaifi walked out, saying he had reservations over continuing the session marked by distrust. But, shortly afterward, he returned without explanation. Still, politicians were hopeful that a deal could emerge. Prior to the walkout, Mahmoud Othman, a Kurdish lawmaker, said, ""We reached a power-sharing deal but it is like assembling a car with different parts and hoping it will work."" Iraq's government had been in a stalemate since the March 7 parliamentary elections, in which al-Maliki won 89 seats but lost to Allawi's bloc, which won 91 seats. The political vacuum that followed has stoked fears that political instability would fester. In Washington, a senior administration official who did not want to be identified called the agreement ""a big step for Iraq."" ""We've worked very hard in recent months with the Iraqis to achieve one basic result, and that's a government that's inclusive, that reflects the results of the elections, that includes all the major blocs representing Iraq's ethnic and sectarian groups, and that does not exclude or marginalize anyone,"" the official said. ""And that's exactly what the Iraqis seem to have agreed to do."" Another senior administration official who asked not to be identified told reporters, ""This really is an Iraqi victory because this was an Iraqi decision that was made by Iraqis in Iraq."" The first senior administration official said U.S. President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden had spoken ""to virtually all of the major Iraqi leaders"" in recent days. In the calls, Obama ""reiterated our strong desire to see an inclusive government in Iraq, and welcomed the steps that have been taken toward reaching that goal,"" said Ben Rhodes, deputy National Security Council adviser for strategic communications. ""He also stressed the need for Dr. Allawi, other members of Iraqiyya, and representatives from all of the winning blocs to hold leadership positions in the new national partnership government."" The move comes as the United States has been drawing down its seven-year military presence to a noncombat force. Overall levels of violence have decreased since 2006 and 2007, but the country has endured eruptions of attacks lately that resemble the Sunni-Shiite sectarian violence during the height of the war. The incumbent al-Maliki, whose State of Law coalition is Shiite, has backing in Iran and from many Iraqi Shiites, including the influential Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr. The choice of a Sadrist as a deputy parliament speaker reflects the movement's clout, and al-Maliki's alliance with Sadrists has stoked concern among U.S. officials because of anti-Americanism in the group. Allawi, who served as prime minister in the early years of the new post-Saddam Hussein Iraqi government, is from a Shiite background but is a secular figure who is well regarded by many American officials. His bloc, regarded as secular and cross-sectarian, has won a great deal of support from Sunni Arabs and he has consistently opposed al-Maliki for another term as prime minister. The two leaders had been jockeying for enough votes for a coalition government, but neither had been able to garner the 163-seat majority needed in the Council of Representatives to form a government. Earlier this week, Iraq's top political leaders met in the Kurdish north to break the more than eight-month deadlock, a development sponsored by Kurdistan Regional Government. There had been fears that Allawi's bloc would boycott any government led by al-Maliki, but the creation of an entity called The National Council for the Strategic Policies appeared to have helped ease the way for compromise. The body was created in an effort to reduce the power of the prime minister, Othman said, and the committee was to be headed by Allawi. Iraqiya was demanding that legislators pass a law within 30 days forming the national council and forming a committee to review the files of people illegally detained, a great concern for Sunni Arabs who have accused Iraq's Shiite-dominated government of persecuting them. It was calling for a final agreement on outstanding legislation and for canceling a ban on three top Sunni Arab politicians from running in elections. Those three have been accused of ties to Saddam Hussein's outlawed Baathist movement. If a power-sharing agreement is not reached in which Iraq's Sunnis feel fairly represented, sectarian violence could re-erupt in Iraq, a country where politics and violence tend to go hand in hand. Many Iraqis told CNN that they blame a recent rise in violence on the political vacuum of the last eight months.","Eight months of bickering and paralysis had appeared to end in a power-sharing agreement .

"(CNN) -- The disputed head of the Ivory Coast will not step down, one of his key ministers said Saturday, despite the threat by West African leaders to use military force to force him out. A day earlier, a statement from the 15-member Economic Community of West African States said its 15 members would not hesitate to use ""legitimate force"" if necessary to defuse an escalating crisis in the Ivory Coast. But Alcide Djedje, the foreign affairs minister for incumbent president Laurent Gbagbo, on Saturday dismissed the threat as part of a Western plot spearheaded by France. He said that his regime views the prospect of outside military action unlikely, claiming that the West African group's members would be reluctant to send soldiers into the Ivory Coast. The organization's move was the latest to isolate Gbagbo, amid sweeping international sentiment that he is not the Ivory Coast's rightfully elected leader and that his forces have perpetrated human rights abuses against his opponents. The United Nations, African Union, European Union and numerous individual nations have called for Gbagbo to step down, with many also calling out his regime for its actions against political foes in the past week that have reportedly killed scores of people. Still, the call from the Economic Community was especially significant, given that the Ivory Coast is a member and its mention of possible military action. ""In the event that Mr. Gbagbo fails to heed this immutable demand of ECOWAS, the Community would be left with no alternative but to take other measures, including the use of legitimate force, to achieve the goals of the Ivorian people,"" the group said in a statement following an emergency meeting Friday in Abuja, Nigeria. Under the leadership of Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, the regional bloc will coordinate, ""without delay,"" a meeting of defense ministers from member countries ""to plan future actions, including the provision of security along the Cote d'Ivoire-Liberia border,"" the statement said. This back-and-forth comes as the security situation in the Ivory Coast continues to deteriorate. The United Nations refugee agency said Saturday that about 14,000 Ivory Coast residents escaping that country have fled to eastern Liberia, some walking hours if not days before boarding barges on rivers bordering the West African nation. A few deaths have been reported among the refugees, including a child who drowned while crossing the Cestos River into Butuo. In some locales without ambulances, U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees vehicles are being used to take people out to get medical care. ""Some are arriving with severely swollen feet,... some families said they had walked three to four days through the bush with little food,"" the U.N. agency said in a statement. A spokesman for Alassane Ouattara, widely recognized as the Ivory Coast's legitimate leader following a November 28 run-off election, accused Gbagbo of defying democratic ideals and instead embarking on new era of violence. Spokesman Patrick Achi said Friday that Ouattara hopes the West African leaders will be able to help end the turmoil. Meanwhile, the Dutch Defense Ministry said on Friday that at the request of France, it had dispatched one of its ships to the Ivory Coast to help evacuate European citizens in case the situation worsens. And U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said earlier this week that the United States and other countries were discussing with African nations the possibility of augmenting the existing U.N. force in the Ivory Coast. However, he said it was unclear what a U.S. contribution could look like -- forces of logistical support or something more indirect were among the options. The African Union has suspended the Ivory Coast from the organization ""until such a time the democratically elected president effectively assumes state power."" The World Bank has halted lending and disbursing funds to Ivory Coast and has closed its office in the country. On Friday, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon welcomed the decision of the U.N. General Assembly to recognize Ouattara as the winner of the disputed Ivory Coast election. ""This important decision reflects the united position of the international community with respect to the legitimacy of the new government led by President Ouattara,"" a spokesman for the secretary-general said in a written statement. Kyung-wha Kang, the U.N. deputy high commissioner for human rights, has said that between December 16 and Tuesday, human rights officers had ""substantiated allegations of 173 killings, 90 instances of torture and ill treatment, 471 arrests and detentions and 24 cases of enforced or involuntary disappearances."" She added that the actual numbers may be much higher because ""it has been impossible to investigate all the allegations of serious human rights violations, including reports of mass graves, due to restrictions on movement by U.N. personnel."" While acknowledging ""the situation is very, very difficult to live"" in, Charles Ble Goude -- the nation's youth minister under Gbagbo -- said Thursday the government is ""dealing with that."" He said ""the U.N. report is not correct,"" especially in its fingering fellow Gbagbo backers as being to blame for the recent violence. Instead, he accused Ouattara's supporters of using weapons at what had been billed as peaceful rallies to attack soldiers. After last month's election, the country's Independent Electoral Commission named Ouattara the winner. But its Constitutional Council invalidated those results and declared that Gbagbo won. Goude said that he and others in Gbagbo's circle couldn't accept the electoral commission picking Ouattara, noting that it announced its decision in a hotel that was also being used as Ouattara's headquarters. While stressing a desire for talks on the issue, he said there is no intention for Gbagbo to forfeit a seat that he believes is rightfully his. ""Why do you want someone who won an election to step down?"" Goude asked. ""The president has been elected.""","The Ivory Coast's Laurent Gbagbo will not step down, his foreign minister says .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- The cholera epidemic already blamed for more than 1,100 deaths in Haiti could worsen because of poor sanitation in the earthquake-ravaged country, U.S. medical researchers reported Thursday. A lack of treated drinking water, coupled with poor hand hygiene and food-preparation practices, make the 1.3 million people still living in camps particularly vulnerable, according to a new study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""The course of the cholera outbreak in Haiti is difficult to predict,"" the report states. ""The Haitian population has no pre-existing immunity to cholera, and environmental conditions in Haiti are favorable for its continued spread."" Jordan Tappero, a CDC epidemiologist in Haiti, said Haitian authorities and aid agencies are working to limit the epidemic by emphasizing clean water and sanitation. But he added, ""We expect we will be working very hard for many months to come."" Haiti has not reported a cholera outbreak in more than a century. The current epidemic was first reported in October and has now spread to eight of the Caribbean nation's 10 provinces, the CDC found. Reports linking the outbreak to Nepalese troops from the U.N. peacekeeping mission MINUSTAH sparked riots in the northern port city of Cap-Haitien on Tuesday. A new round of violent protests erupted Thursday in the capital Port-au-Prince, eyewitnesses told CNN. U.N. officials have denied the Nepalese were to blame for the outbreak. The CDC has said the strain of the cholera bacteria responsible is ""indistinguishable"" from one found in other parts of the world, including south Asia, but researchers are unlikely to be able to pinpoint how it arrived in Haiti. ""The reality is that we have a serious problem here,"" CDC spokeswoman Lola Russell said. The emphasis is on controlling the outbreak, ""so that more people do not become ill and potentially die from cholera."" The epidemic comes as Haiti -- already the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere -- struggles to recover from the January earthquake that killed more than 200,000 people. Even before the quake, only 12 percent of the Haitian population of 9.8 million received treated tap water and only 17 percent had access to adequate sanitation, the CDC noted. ""The water safety and sanitation systems in Haiti were weak be before the earthquake and made weaker by the earthquake, so conditions are ripe for the further spread of cholera,"" Tappero told CNN. Some symptoms of cholera, an acute, bacterial illness caused by drinking tainted water, can be mild or even nonexistent. But the disease can cause profuse watery diarrhea and vomiting, leading to death by rapid dehydration. The heart of the outbreak is the Haitian province of Artibonite, north of Port-au-Prince. Interviews with victims hospitalized in the first days of the outbreak found that two-thirds of them had been drinking untreated water from rivers or canals, the same percentage did not routinely use chlorine to sanitize drinking water and nearly four out of five defecated in the open. And as the current outbreak spreads, infected people could spread the disease further by preparing food without proper hygiene, the CDC reported. ""The way to prevent acquiring cholera when sanitation is poor is to take your water from a clean water source or treat water yourself in the home, and use good sanitary practices with clean water when preparing and cooking food,"" Tappero said. CNN's Miriam Falco and Matt Smith contributed to this report.","U.S. report says the cholera outbreak's course is ""difficult to predict""

"Port-Au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Like cholera itself, Haiti's protests against the United Nations spread Thursday to the capital, Port-au-Prince, as angry people took to the streets demanding the global body get out of their country. Similar demonstrations erupted earlier this week in the northern coastal city of Cap-Haitien after assertions that U.N. peacekeepers from Nepal were responsible for starting the cholera outbreak that has claimed more than 1,100 lives and spread to eight of the nation's 10 departments. The United Nations has denied that its forces were responsible for the outbreak. In Port-au-Prince on Thursday, a planned protest began peacefully in the center of the city but turned violent as it moved toward the presidential palace, with one woman overcome by tear gas, witnesses said. At the central square, Champs de Mars Plaza, several hundred young men moving in a pack blocked traffic by setting fire to tires in the street and overturning Dumpsters. Several threw rocks at a campaign poster for presidential candidate Jude Celestin, whose candidacy has been endorsed by outgoing president Rene Preval. Others threw Molotov cocktails at the poster. Some Haitians have said Celestin is a symbol of what is not working in the country, and that Preval's endorsement of him means the election -- set for November 28 -- will not be fair. Near the presidential palace, which was destroyed in the January 12 earthquake that killed more than 200,000 people and left more than 1 million homeless, stores were closed and few cars were in the streets, though pedestrians were moving about freely. A sprawling makeshift tent city that is home to thousands of people who lost their homes in the quake is located in the area. ""The Haitian government is never do nothing for us,"" said Pierre Aliodor, a protester who lives in the camp. ""And we know the international government is still spending a lot of money for the Haitian people. But Preval, with his government, he still keeps their money to take back to the United States to buy some house."" Since the earthquake struck, neither he nor his wife had received any help from the government or from any of the many nongovernmental organizations that are in Haiti, Aliodor said. Aliodor called for elections to be delayed. ""This is not election time,"" he said, adding that both Preval and the U.N. forces should depart, ""because they are not good for the Haitian people."" In another part of town, dozens of Haitians -- most of them young and male -- attacked a government tractor that was being used to clear barricades blocking the streets. In addition to the 1,110 reported cholera deaths, another 18,382 people have been hospitalized with the disease, the health ministry reported. The hospital death rate was 4.0 percent, far above the none to 1.0 percent that infectious disease experts said they expect in developed countries. In Washington, Mark Ward, the acting director of the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance at the U.S. Agency for International Development, said U.S. authorities have ""a lot of confidence"" in the Haitian government's response to the outbreak. The U.S. government strategy for aid in Haiti is to focus on prevention, he said, citing the need for clean drinking water, the addition of chlorine to the water supply, the ready availability of oral rehydration salts, education of the populace about how to protect themselves from getting the disease, and money to expand treatment centers. ""We're going to invest a lot of money in their health system in the next five years,"" said Thomas C. Adams, special coordinator for Haiti. ""Every hour that the efforts of medical and relief workers are obstructed means more deaths of Haitians from cholera,"" said Dr. Mirta Roses, director of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). ""We understand the frustration of many Haitians with the tragic situation that has developed as a result of systemic poverty, the January earthquake and now the cholera epidemic. But relief and medical workers are as critical to saving lives as rescue teams were after the earthquake."" In Cap-Haitien, a cholera treatment center at the main stadium is being operated by Medecins Sans Frontieres, also known as Doctors without Borders. Before the recent unrest, the organization was planning to open another center in a different part of town, said Dr. Lea Guido, PAHO representative in Port-au-Prince. On Wednesday alone, the center took in 100 patients. PAHO said the unrest had led it and other United Nations agencies to discontinue much of their work supporting cholera treatment centers, training health personnel, and delivering supplies to affected communities. ""The last shipment of medical supplies was delivered over the weekend, and we had to postpone distribution planned for Monday,"" said Guido. ""The airport was closed, and many roads remain blocked. We have not been able to ship new supplies to the area at all this week."" Beginning Monday, residents of Cap-Haitien, which has been hard hit by the outbreak, began demonstrations against U.N. peacekeepers. The northern port city is in the North Department, the Haitian province that has the highest fatality rate from cholera, 7.5 percent. ""Experience shows that without access to health care, the rate could rise to as much as five times that figure,"" PAHO said in a statement. Health workers at Hopital Universitaire, the city's main hospital, treated at least six patients with gunshot wounds.  ""MINUSTAH shot them,"" said a man pushing a wheelbarrow holding one of the wounded. He was referring to the U.N. forces in Haiti by their acronym. At Cap-Haitien's Justinien Hospital, Dr. Wilton Cheruben told CNN that 37 people with bullet wounds had been treated between Monday and Wednesday night. The victims included a 9-year-old and a 14-year-old who were shot in the mouth; a 6-year-old was shot in the back and an 11-year-old was shot in the arm, he said. ""Right now, we don't have any anesthetics, and the people really need some help,"" he said. In Cap-Haitien, PAHO staff members have been confined to their living quarters since Monday. Roses said Thursday it was impossible to identify the origins of the epidemic in Haiti ""with currently available data."" Rita Colwell, a cholera expert at the University of Maryland in College Park and the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, said the reported links between the outbreak and peacekeepers is not based on evidence. ""The evidence is not clear at all to be making any charge whatsoever for importing the disease,"" she said. ""We've been jumping to conclusions without evidence, without facts."" U.N. officials said the demonstrations have disrupted logistical operations, including the supply of clean water and proper sanitation. The U.N.'s World Food Programme reported that one of its warehouses had been looted and that food supplies were burned. The private charity Oxfam suspended water chlorination projects and other private charities pulled out of the Cap Haitien area. U.N. staffers have suggested the violence is politically motivated and said it's especially troubling just ahead of Haiti's presidential elections.

While the danger was real -- especially with the suspect in arm's reach of the officer's gun -- Pierce told HLN's Jane Velez-Mitchell that her thought process Saturday night was simple: The police officer needed help, and she was in a position to give it. ""I didn't even think about what (the suspect) could have had, I didn't think about what he could have done to me,"" Pierce said Thursday. ""I just went and tried to help."" A camera mounted to the officer's car showed the police officer -- identified by CNN affiliate WHIO as Officer Jonathan Seiter -- pulling over 64-year-old Otto Coleman on what appeared to be a routine traffic stop. But then Coleman attacked the officer, leading to a full-on scuffle. ""It was hands on, and it was a boxing match,"" Seiter told WHIO. Around that time, Pierce said she was driving by with her aunt, heading to a birthday party. She asked her aunt to pull over, then got out of the car and ran toward the scene to help. For less than a minute, Pierce pounded Coleman repeatedly on his head to help subdue him until more help arrived. ""That could have been my father or grandfather,"" Pierce said of her decision to help Seiter. ""I just kept on swinging, because I didn't want (Coleman) to get me or anything."" Pierce said that police initially handcuffed her, before soon realizing her part in the battle and releasing her. Subsequently, with Coleman by then under arrest, she and the other police officers exchanged high fives before she headed off to her party. Dayton police Sgt. Larry Tolpin warned that people could get seriously hurt when they jump into the fray -- even if it's on law enforcement's side. Still, he told CNN affiliate WDTN that Pierce deserved thanks for her effort. ""Don't get me wrong, I'm not endorsing that citizens participate in this manner,"" Tolpin said. ""But under this particular circumstance, it was very commendable of her.""","Angela Pierce was driving by when she saw a Dayton police officer and suspect scuffling .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israeli archaeologists have discovered an ancient Roman bathhouse that was probably used by the soldiers who destroyed the Second Temple in Jerusalem, the Israel Antiquities Authority announced Monday. The surprise discovery includes the mark of Rome's Tenth Legion -- as well as the paw print of a dog. The animal probably belonged to one of the soldiers, excavation director Ofer Sion said. The print ""could have happened accidentally or have been intended as a joke,"" he said. Archaeologists were not expecting to find the Roman structure in the Jewish Quarter, where a mikvah, or Jewish ritual bath, was being constructed. ""The mark of the soldiers of the Tenth Legion, in the form of the stamped impressions on the roof tiles and the in situ mud bricks, bears witness to the fact that they were the builders of the structure,"" he said. ""It seems that the bathhouse was used by these soldiers who were garrisoned there after suppressing the Bar Kokhba uprising in 135 CE (A.D.), when the pagan city Aelia Capitolina was established,"" he explained. The structure includes a number of plastered bathtubs in the side of a pool, a pipe used to fill it with water, and a white industrial mosaic pavement on the floor. Hundreds of terra cotta roof tiles were found on the floors of the pool, indicating it was a covered structure, he added. The bathhouse tiles are stamped with the symbols of the Tenth Legion ""Fretensis"" -- LEG X FR, he said. The discovery shows that the Roman encampment established to help keep Israel under Roman domination was larger than previously thought, another expert said. ""Despite the very extensive archaeological excavations that were carried out in the Jewish Quarter, so far not even one building has been discovered there that belonged to the Roman legion,"" Jerusalem district archaeologist Yuval Baruch said. ""The absence of such a find led to the conclusion that Aelia Capitolina, the Roman city which was established after the destruction of Jerusalem, was small and limited in area,"" he said. But the discovery of the 1,800-year-old bathhouse ""together with other discoveries of recent years, shows that the city was considerably larger than what we previously estimated,"" he said. Understanding the ancient Roman city of Aelia Capitolina is ""extremely valuable,"" he said, because it determined the shape of Jerusalem's historic walls ""and the location of the gates to this very day.""","The surprise discovery shows the ancient Roman encampment was bigger than thought .

"New York (CNN) -- The United States and China could play a crucial role in helping finally to resolve the conflict that plagues the Korean Peninsula, says analyst Fareed Zakaria. In one of the most violent incidents in decades, North Korea shelled a South Korean island Tuesday, killing four people. North Korea accused the South of provoking the shelling of Yeonpyeong Island by holding a military exercise in the Yellow Sea. And South Korea responded by charging that the North's actions were a ""definite military provocation."" In an interview with CNN, Zakaria said a long-term solution to the Korean conflict would require high-level secret talks aimed at assuring the government of China that if the two Koreas were reunified, it would not be faced with a nuclear-armed U.S. ally on its border. He said China ""has the power to make the North Koreans pay a very, very high price were they not to listen to the Chinese, because the Chinese provide the vital food and fuel that keeps the country alive. Remember, this is a country with almost no indigenous economic activity, and so it would be very difficult for them to meet their most vital supply needs."" ""The Chinese have a lot of influence. They have so far been very careful to apply some pressure, but they have almost never cut off food or fuel -- except for a day or two when they have really wanted to send a strong signal, and, by the way when they have done that, it's worked, it gets the North Koreans' attention."" The author and host of CNN's ""Fareed Zakaria GPS"" spoke to CNN on Tuesday. Here is an edited transcript: . CNN: What's the significance of North Korea's actions? Fareed Zakaria: I think it's very worrying, very troubling. Combined with the sinking of that South Korean ship, it is the most provocative thing the North Koreans have done in years in terms of instigating hostilities. The regime is unpredictable but ruthless, and we know that the South Koreans are feeling some substantial pressure to respond in some way, and then you have all the other great powers in the region watching anxiously. The whole thing has the potential to spiral out of control. CNN: Do you think it's connected to the succession process in North Korea? Zakaria: I think that's probably the most plausible theory that I've heard. They're clearly going through a succession process. It appears to be one that is fairly complex -- there are different factions that are being accommodated or tussled with. Sometimes it feels like something out of a Shakespearean play where the aging king is appointing his dauphin as the successor, but there will be a regent who will actually administer, and by the way his sister has just been made a four-star general in the army. But outside that kind of theatrics what it suggests is that the family is trying to consolidate power, that there is perhaps some opposition in some quarters, perhaps in the military, perhaps in other quarters. And by creating an external diversion, the regime is trying to consolidate power and unify the various parts of the government. But one has to admit, this is just a theory. The regime is a black box; we have so little contact that nobody really knows. CNN: There's been a suggestion by some that North Korea is really hoping to force the issue about getting direct talks with the United States rather than be part of a six-nation diplomatic process. Zakaria: I don't buy the idea that people send you these signals by killing soldiers, sinking warships, sinking ships. If the North Koreans want to talk to the Americans, they can ask to talk to the Americans, and they could ask to do it within the six-party talks; they could ask outside the framework; they could bring that up -- the issue of bilateral talks with the Americans in the six-party talks. Do they really have to kill the South Koreans to make that point? I think this idea of brutal violence as some kind of sophisticated signaling device strikes me as highly unlikely. Far more likely is that this is a pretty thuggish regime that is consolidating power by creating external threats and enemies, but we probably should be open to any signs that they do want to have negotiation. I myself doubt that this is the moment that they want to do anything. They know that that door is open; the president has a very capable emissary, Stephen Bosworth, who is his envoy on this topic, very well-versed in this issue, former ambassador to South Korea, and my sense is that the North Koreans have not reached out to him. CNN: Bosworth made a statement that he talked to the Chinese about this, but it didn't seem like there was any special progress on that front. Zakaria: The Chinese have been pretty helpful on managing the situation, making sure that it doesn't spiral out of control, but we haven't been able to get to the next level with the Chinese, which is to say that the Chinese sustain this regime. The Chinese provide about 90 percent of their energy and about 40 percent of their food aid. It's pretty reasonable to say that without Chinese support their regime would collapse, but the Chinese have legitimate concerns about what the future of the Korean Peninsula would look like if there were a North Korean implosion. There is in their minds the kind of scenario in which Korea unifies on the South's terms and becomes a unified much larger nation sitting on China's border with American troops in the unified Korea, with an American security alliance, and by the way with nuclear weapons. They would view it as a kind of threatening or destabilizing presence. And so I think that is what makes the Chinese very reluctant to do anything that would cause the regime to implode or cause the regime to start a downward spiral. I think what needs to happen at some point, is that the United States and Beijing need to engage in a very high-level and very secret conversation about the future of the Korean Peninsula -- a conversation in which the United States should make certain informal or perhaps even formal guarantees regarding the role of nuclear weapons on the peninsula and the nature of American troop deployments. ... We should make clear that we would denuclearize Korea or we would encourage the South Koreans to denuclearize Korea, and then we would not move the troops that we have north of the North/South border. CNN: This is all in the event of a unification? Zakaria: Right, so we make clear that in the event of a unification we understand the Chinese concern, and we would try to respond to it, without obviously in any way jeopardizing the historical relationship with South Korea. Unless we have some kind of long-term strategic conversation with the Chinese about what the future of the Korean Peninsula would look like, they don't have an incentive to in any way push the North Koreans. So we've got to get into a conversation with them to say, ""We understand your problem. We should talk about those concerns now, and would you be willing to get tough on North Korean nukes and North Korean behavior?"" CNN: Here's a different view, which some have raised -- what is the United States doing in Korea decades and decades after the end of the hostilities, and should the U.S. stay indefinitely? Zakaria: Well, I think that's very shortsighted. Look, I am in general someone who believes the United States is overcommitted around the world. I believe we have to draw down and pare back many of our commitments, but I think maintaining a stabilizing role in Korea is absolutely crucial. The center of power is shifting to Asia, and Korea is probably the single place in Asia where there's the greatest potential for a war between the great powers -- Russia, China, South Korea, North Korea, Japan, all get involved in this. So for the United States to be able to play a constructive role will be absolutely vital to its ability to be a Pacific power, to be in what is now the new geo-economic cockpit of the world. I think there is a perfectly reasonable case to be made to have us draw down in places like Germany, where the threat to American security is nonexistent, to draw down from Iraq and the Middle East to where we have an overly large military presence, but Korea is a vital national interest of the United States, and I think that the major players in the region, particularly South Korea, strongly want an American presence there.","Fareed Zakaria: China has tremendous influence over North Korea .

"(CNN) -- An Arlington, Texas, police officer was among three people killed in a shooting at an apartment complex Tuesday night, officials said. It was at least the second fatal shooting in two days of a law enforcement officer in the United States. On Monday, a Georgia state trooper was fatally shot after a traffic stop in northwest Atlanta. In the Arlington incident, the officer had been dispatched to an apartment complex to check out a report of domestic assault, city spokeswoman Tiara Richard told reporters. ""Shortly afterwards, officers received a call of a shooting at the same  location.  When officers arrived, they found  three people deceased here in an apartment at the complex. One of those people  was an officer,"" she said. Authorities did not immediately release the name of the victims. ""It's a tragic  situation. Our hearts are broken tonight,"" Mayor Robert Cluck said in a statement. In January, another Arlington police officer died in the line of duty, Richard said. Officer Craig Story was killed when his motorcycle struck a school bus about a mile away from Tuesday's shooting scene, CNN affiliate WFAA reported. ""Any time you lose an officer who  is working in the line of duty -- or not in the line of duty -- it's hard on the  department,"" Richard told reporters. ""It's hard on the city as a whole. These are people who day in and  day out, they go out and do their job and they are doing it to protect the  citizens here.  It's a hard loss for anyone...especially during this time of  year."" Meanwhile, Georgia officials have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of the state trooper late Monday. Trooper Chadwick LeCroy, 38 was shot twice in the face following the traffic stop and he died en route to a hospital, a state patrol spokesman said. The suspect escaped in the trooper's patrol car, which was found abandoned about half a mile away. Shortly afterward, he was taken into custody, the spokesman said.

"Dublin, Republic of Ireland (CNN) -- Europe and the International Monetary Fund are in the process of finalizing a rescue package worth up to 100 billion euros to bail out Ireland's banking sector. What are the implications of the bailout for Irish people and the rest of the world? When will we know the full details of the rescue package? Over the next few weeks, the exact size of the bailout will be revealed and include details of when it will take effect, and what changes to Ireland's austerity measures the IMF will insist on in exchange for the facility. On Wednesday, Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen announced a tough four-year austerity plan, which included a huge cut in welfare spending, a rise in the Value Added Tax (VAT) rate, and thousands of redundancies in the country's public sector. However Dublin stopped short of changing Ireland's low corporate tax rate. Why does Ireland need the money? Ireland needs funds to shore up balance sheets after its government pumped billions of euros into Irish banks to keep them afloat, effectively nationalizing most of them. The European Central Bank is lending money to Irish banks because other banks won't. And lately people and companies have been pulling funds out of the banks. This couldn't have continued. What would the dangers have been if the crisis continued? A run on Irish banks -- mass withdrawals by customers worried their bank will go bust -- would have been bad for the eurozone, as it could have forced the EU and IMF to scramble to provide emergency funds within days, rather than in the more orderly, considered way now being organized. Also if yields (interest rates) on Irish government bonds kept rising, the same would probably happen to bonds issued by countries such as Spain and Portugal -- this weakens the finances of banks in those countries (because their large holdings of Spanish and Portuguese bonds are growing less valuable), which will make them inclined to lend less -- which is damaging for the economy. What does the bailout mean for Irish citizens? Analysts say a bailout is not likely to affect Irish citizens directly but will have beneficial effects nonetheless. ""All it's going to do is keep the banks going,"" said Peter Morici of the University of Maryland. ""It's not going to change the objective conditions for the average Irish people."" But Allan Timmermann, who holds an endowed chair of finance at the University of California San Diego, says a bailout will make life easier for ordinary folks because the aid might lessen the severity of service cuts the government will need to make. ""If you imagine that there's no bailout, the measures that Ireland would have to take in terms of cutbacks would have to be much more drastic."" What will the bailout mean for people across Europe? It means their tax dollars going to pay for yet another bank bailout plan, after the European Union bailed out Greece to the tune of 110 billion euros (currently $150 billion) in May. But it also means the markets might calm down, taking pressure off Spain and Portugal, which are also facing budget problems. Bringing the yield on Portuguese and Spanish government bonds back to normal levels would mean they pay less on interest and more, hopefully, toward reducing their own deficits. Would it mean anything for Americans? The stock market might regain what it has lost in the past two weeks over ""fears of European recovery."" It could also mean the dollar starts to fall against the euro, which might boost American exports to Europe, since American good would be cheaper for euro-spenders to buy. Who would pay for an Irish bailout? After Greece took European and International Monetary Fund loans, European Union countries pledged nearly $1 trillion for any country that can't pay its bills by raising funds through normal debt markets. Ireland does not have that problem, but it's clear the EU will allow Ireland to pump loans into its banks (given the government controls them now anyway). EU countries and their taxpayers pay according to their size: Germany the most and Malta the least. The United Kingdom and Sweden, neither of which use the euro currency, have also said they will lend about 8 billion euros and 1 billion euros respectively, to Ireland. What strings will be attached to the rescue package? The extra banking injection will take Ireland's fiscal deficit from the planned 11.75 percent of gross domestic product in 2010 to as high as 32 percent. That's 10 times higher than the three percent allowed under the Maastricht Treaty agreed by the EU when it laid out the foundations of its single currency in 1992. The big question was whether the EU and the IMF would demand that Ireland's low level of corporation tax of 12.5 percent -- one of the lowest in the EU -- which helps keep the country competitive, be raised. Ireland has said it alone decides taxes, and decided against any change in its four-year austerity plan. The IMF and financial markets will be analyzing the details of the plan to reassure themselves that Finance Minister Brian Lenihan can deliver on his pledge to shrink the fiscal deficit back down to three percent of GDP in 2014. So how did Ireland get into this mess? Ireland recorded stunning economic growth during what is known as the ""Celtic Tiger"" era from around 1993 to 2007 when the global financial crisis hit. Irish banks, like others around the world, loaned money to people who in some cases couldn't pay it back. Cheap loans created extra demand for housing and as prices surged the construction industry raced to build more. House prices multiplied during the period, making many homeowners impressive profits and generating fat tax receipts for the government. However, when the housing bubble burst, consumer spending slowed sharply. Unemployment tripled from around four percent in 2005 to 11.8 percent in 2009. The most recent figure, for September, puts it even higher at 13.7 percent. What has been the reaction of Irish people towards the bailout? One of Monday's papers carries the word ""humiliation"" as part of its headline, and many people are unhappy that the IMF has come to town. The government is unpopular and it is hard to see how the bailout will help. But what people don't want to see is the IMF dictating terms of the budget over the next couple of years. The government is trying to reassure voters that will not be the case, but it remains to be seen. CNN's Jim Boulden contributed to this report.","Europe and IMF discussing 100 billion euro bailout for Ireland's banking sector .

"San Francisco, California (CNN) -- Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg favors the little guy, but that attitude can pose obstacles for popular websites that want to work with his company. Apple and Google, which are among the biggest technology businesses in the world, find themselves stonewalled at times by Zuckerberg and company. That sometimes results in less functional applications. Apple launched its music-centric social network, called Ping, as part of an iTunes update that contained a Facebook component. But Apple had to remove integration with the world's largest social network hours after Ping launched. Last week Twitter announced an agreement with Apple's Ping. Steve Jobs, Apple's CEO, spurned Facebook for what he considered were ""onerous terms."" When questioned about this in an interview onstage at the Web 2.0 Summit in San Francisco on Tuesday, Zuckerberg said with a shrug, ""It's fine."" Then Zuckerberg pointed out that the two work together in many ways. For example, Facebook's app ""is on the vast majority of iPhones,"" he said at an event earlier this month at Facebook's Palo Alto, California, headquarters. As for Facebook's relationship with Google, the two are in the midst of a public spat about letting users import and export personal data between the social network and Gmail. Facebook, which launched an email service on Monday, doesn't let users easily migrate addresses to other apps. Zuckerberg said at the conference on Tuesday that this move was meant to protect the private contact information of a user's friends. He backtracked near the end of that fireside chat and highlighted the data export issue as a potential mistake. ""I've made so many mistakes in running the company so far,"" he said. ""We still make mistakes all of the time."" The trouble, he said, is figuring out which of the company's myriad problems ""really matter."" Zuckerberg also seemed to distance himself from Google, the undisputed leader in search, last month when Facebook announced a deal with Microsoft's Bing. ""They're just trying to rapidly gain [market] share by doing awesome stuff,"" Zuckerberg said of Microsoft at the Bing event. ""They're really the underdog here."" But Microsoft wasn't spared from criticisms during Tuesday's event. Microsoft, a massive computer software company and an investor in Facebook, has thousands of engineers, Zuckerberg pointed out; Facebook has fewer, and is therefore seen by developers as a more effective and attractive employer, he said. Zuckerberg makes it known that he has a soft spot for budding entrepreneurs. When asked about ""The Social Network"" -- the film based on the founding of Facebook -- Zuckerberg boasted of fan mail from people who say his story inspired them to become entrepreneurs. His mission is to ""enable others to build"" social networking services, which can be accomplished using Facebook's platform, he said. Small-time developers can freely make use of Facebook's offerings, but larger companies must work directly or be locked out. Despite amassing 500 million people actively using the service, Zuckerberg still doesn't consider Facebook a giant company. ""In some ways, I actually think we're only now entering the zone where a lot of entrepreneurs will consider working with us,"" he said. But during Yahoo CEO Carol Bartz's onstage interview earlier Tuesday, she described Facebook as Yahoo's ""competition."" This sentiment could create even greater disconnects between Facebook's service and popular apps, as is the case with Gmail and Ping. Without being specific, Zuckerberg derided some large internet companies, saying they won't make it past a social networking revolution. ""Some aren't going to make it,"" he said on Tuesday. ""I think there's an exciting opportunity for some entrepreneurs."" Zuckerberg's advice to ""incumbents,"" as he calls technology giants: ""Get on the bus."" But that doesn't mean he's going to make it easy for them to board.","Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg favors ""underdogs"" and entrepreneurs .

"Paris, France (CNN) -- Last week Reporters Without Borders released a letter calling on WikiLeaks to take down the names of civilians identified as having collaborated with the International Security Assistance Force and with NATO forces. In our view making the names of Afghan civilians public could put them at risk of reprisals from the Taliban or other insurgent forces in Afghanistan. Some news reports and some pundits portrayed our statement as an unequivocal condemnation of WikiLeaks, but this is not the case. Reporters Without Borders supports the continued existence and work of WikiLeaks, and we are ready to take part in any discussion about the problems inherent in managing and disclosing vast amounts of critical information. But we also believe that to continue their work, WikiLeaks and other websites likely to publish documents from whistle-blowers need to ensure that the information disclosed does not pose an avoidable threat to the security of civilians. Pointing that out does not amount to, for example, support for the Pentagon's request that WikiLeaks remove all documents from its website or a call for outright censorship. In fact, WikiLeaks has published useful information, and we hope it can continue to serve journalists and the wider public. We have spoken out strongly against the Pentagon's request that WikiLeaks remove all documents from its website and against the detention of the alleged source of the leaks, Pfc. Bradley Manning. We've also criticized proposed amendments to the federal shield law that would exclude whistle-blowing sites such as WikiLeaks from any legal protection of sources. We are not disputing the importance of the Afghan War Diary. Indeed, it is more important than ever that there be an outlet for information governments want to keep secret. Too often, government departments and agencies resort without justification to declaring documents classified or secret to conceal information that is of public interest. Exaggerated and at times unsubstantiated safety concerns have been used to block important information from being made public in the past. The Pentagon, the Bush and Obama administrations are no strangers to these tactics. Whistle-blowing sites deserve, and have, our support. However, the case of the war logs illustrates the difficulties that will arise when dealing with the sheer mass of information that may become available. Even the largest news organizations in the world would be overwhelmed, and -- for the moment at least -- WikiLeaks does not command resources of that scope. Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks editor-in-chief, has said that by reviewing the document classification system and certain parts of the material, his organization was able to identify and withhold 15,000 documents that possibly contain the names of innocent informers, and that is commendable. It does not change the fact that releasing so many documents without being able go through the large majority of them is problematic. Whistle-blowing websites need to deal with this issue if they want to avoid giving the authorities an excuse to muzzle them. We should note though, that through the good offices of The New York Times, WikiLeaks requested the help of the Obama White House in vetting the material, a request the White House denied. It is not beyond imagining that rather than cooperate in an attempt to protect its informers and collaborators, the U.S. government chose instead to keep all its tactical options open in its campaign against WikiLeaks. Indeed, Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was quick to say WikiLeaks would have blood on its hands, although he brought no evidence of that. WikiLeaks staff is under considerable pressure from Western governments, and alleged surveillance and rumors of extraditions have exacerbated a climate of apprehension within its day-to-day operations. It cannot be easy working under such conditions. But if the media is to demand a high level of transparency in public affairs, they must also demonstrate a high level of responsibility. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jean-François Julliard.","Jean-François Julliard says Reporters Without Borders supports whistle-blower sites .

"(CNN) -- Under heavy pressure from the United States and allied governments, WikiLeaks appealed to supporters worldwide to mirror its website Sunday as it continued the process of releasing thousands of sensitive U.S. diplomatic cables. ""Wikileaks is currently under heavy attack. In order to make it impossible to ever fully remove Wikileaks from the Internet, we need your help,"" the site told followers Sunday. The message was followed by instructions on how website operators could set up mirror sites that would distribute the documents as WikiLeaks released them. On the microblogging site Twitter, supporters have rallied by offering their sites or by posting links to other mirrors. In an echo of ""Spartacus,"" the 1960 film classic about a slave revolt against ancient Rome, many adopted the hashtag #imwikileaks. ""All the censoring of WikiLeaks is more alarming than the actual content of the leaks. It only further justifies WL's actions,"" read one widely distributed comment. WikiLeaks, which facilitates the anonymous leaking of secret information, began posting the first of more than 250,000 U.S. State Department documents last week. Since then, the site has been hit with denial-of-service attacks, been kicked off servers in the United States and France, and lost a major revenue source on Friday when the U.S.-based PayPal cut off its account. PayPal said WikiLeaks violated its policy against activities that ""encourage, promote, facilitate or instruct others to engage in illegal activity."" And a U.S.-based domain name provider shut down WikiLeaks early Friday, but the controversial website announced hours later that it had employed a company in Switzerland and was back up. In addition, Swedish authorities have issued an arrest warrant for the site's founder, Julian Assange, on unrelated allegations of sex crimes, including rape. Assange has denied the accusations, calling them a smear campaign. The Obama administration has condemned the disclosures, arguing that they harm U.S. diplomacy by exposing confidential communications. A variety of U.S. and Western figures have called for Assange to be prosecuted or even killed. ""I think the man is a high-tech terrorist,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, told CBS' ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday. ""He has done enormous damage to our country. And I think he needs to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law."" But Secretary of State Hillary Clinton managed to make a joke about it at a Washington event Saturday night. Speaking at a dinner for the Kennedy Center Honors, Clinton praised the ""full breadth and depth of American artistry and diversity,"" adding, ""I am writing a cable about it, which I'm sure you'll find soon on your closest website."" Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, told CNN's ""Fareed Zakaria GPS"" that the WikiLeaks disclosures were ""a gaffe on a large, global scale."" But he added, ""This is not a crisis. It's not a disaster."" ""Where I think it creates problems is process-wise, in terms of what people in the future will put down on paper, what people in the future will say,"" he said. The documents released so far have featured sharp U.S. criticism of the government of Afghanistan, where an American-led coalition has been fighting al Qaeda and the Taliban since 2001; intense mistrust between the United States and Pakistan, a nuclear-armed state where top al Qaeda and Taliban figures are believed to be in hiding; blunt assessments of the extent of corruption in Russia; and unflattering descriptions of allied leaders like Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, whom one 2009 cable described as ""a complete mess."" The prime suspect in the disclosure is Bradley Manning, a U.S. soldier now awaiting trial in a Virginia stockade. Manning, a private first class who served as an Army intelligence analyst in Iraq, is charged with leaking video of a 2007 helicopter attack in Iraq to WikiLeaks and with illegally transferring classified data. U.S. officials have said Manning was able to access a wide variety of documents through a computer system that was set up to promote information-sharing after the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington. But Haass warned against an ""overreaction"" that will cause American agencies to share too little intelligence.

Whether it's an off-season value, a cost-of-living advantage, a favorable exchange rate or simply a less-traveled locale, resourceful travelers looking for the finer things will find great bang for their buck in these spots. Argentina . Known for its art, wine, food and fashion, those visiting Argentina can expect a rich cultural experience at a fraction of the cost of many European destinations. Travel specialist Vanessa Guibert Heitner of Limitless Argentina, based in Buenos Aires, says the vibrant capital city and wine-soaked Mendoza are must-see destinations for luxury travelers. Salta in the northwestern tip of the country should also not be overlooked. Heitner estimates a couple could have an exquisite, multicourse meal in Argentina for $60,­ not including wine or drinks. ""Dinner for two at a high-end restaurant is much more accessible than in the United States,"" she says. Sydney, Australia . Getting to Sydney, Australia will be the most expensive part about your vacation, but once you're there, the prices are completely reasonable, says Arabella Bowen, editorial director of Fodor's Travel. ""One of the great advantages is you get to stay at a major luxury grand hotel for a fraction of the price you would pay elsewhere,"" Bowen says. In October, the Four Seasons in Sydney runs about $280 a night, while the same chain in New York City would cost about $1,000, she says. Sydney offers a great mix of city life and outdoor experiences, including visiting the beaches. October is also the middle of spring in Sydney, so temperatures will hover around 72 degrees, Bowen says. ""There's a great vibe to the place,"" she says, ""and the quality of life is absolutely incredible."" Cambodia . Steeped in cultural heritage dating back to the 8th century, the Ruins at Angkor are a huge draw for visitors. ""It's an interesting collision of backpacker travel and luxury,"" Bowen says. Cambodia is high-end in terms of hotel experiences, but extremely cheap in terms of getting around and eating good meals, she says. ""It's hard to get there, but once you're there, it's so incredibly affordable,"" Bowen says. Cambodia travel specialist Sandy Ferguson of Asia Desk, based in Duluth, Georgia, estimates an excellent meal could cost as little as $20, before wine. Ferguson suggests staying in Siem Reap for its proximity to the ruins and selection of high-end hotels. Curacao . Curacao, located in the far south of the Caribbean, has a Latino flavor and plenty of attractions, Bowen says. ""It's an absolutely stunning place to walk around,"" she says. There's also great diving, excellent hiking, golfing and cool cultural nightlife. It's off-season in the Caribbean, and through October, the four-star Hyatt Regency is running its grand opening rate of $149 a night. The hotel has its own golf course, a private beach and tennis courts. Bowen says the Dutch architecture around the island looks a lot like wedding cakes. Add that in with the South American influences, and you've got a ""really interesting cultural mix,"" she says. This extends to the food choices, which are extremely cosmopolitan. Berlin, Germany . ""Berlin is a mercurial city,"" Bowen says. Visitors can enjoy an incredible art scene, cutting-edge shopping, remarkable architecture and unlimited history. ""What's more, Berlin remains more affordable than Paris, London and Rome,"" Bowen says. In October, travelers will get shoulder-season prices. Bowen recommends the Lux 11 hotel for about 140 euros (about $182) per night or the Adlon Kempinski for 270 euros ($351). Similar hotels in Paris would cost an additional 100 euros ($130) or more per night. Bowen says taking a scenic boat cruise on the Spree River can be a great way to start exploring in Berlin. Iceland . For a beautiful outdoors experience married with vibrant nightlife, Iceland is a great choice for the budget-conscious traveler, Bowen says. Reykjavik, the capital of Iceland, has a cool vibe, Bowen says. ""It's more about nightlife and restaurants than it is about cultural activities."" With its lunar-like landscapes and mysterious natural wonders, Iceland's backdrop is a combination of Yellowstone National Park and Montreal, Bowen says. She recommends the Blue Lagoon natural spa and a tour of the unusual scenery. Bowen says autumn is shoulder season in Iceland, so rates are affordable. For example, about $650 will cover some package deals including round-trip airfare and three nights in a four-star hotel. India . With countless resorts, relaxing yoga retreats and shopping galore, India is becoming well-known in luxury travel circles. ""India is a paradise for shoppers,"" says India travel specialist Victor Biswas of International Ventures and Travel, based in New York City. He recommends visiting Jaipur, Mumbai or Delhi for great deals on fabrics and silks. For the best value, Biswas suggests traveling in the off-season --­ April through September ­-- and focusing on the southern part of the country. ""The south of India has better deals all around,"" he says. Biswas suggests visiting the southern city of Chennai, formerly known as Madras, for the best hotels and spas in the area. Indonesia . Known for its many luxury options, Indonesia is a relaxation-seeker's paradise. Recently spotlighted in author Elizabeth Gilbert's best-seller, ""Eat Pray Love,"" the country offers numerous first-class hotels, spas and dining options. ""Spa prices are very reasonable, even at luxury hotels,"" says Indonesia travel specialist Diane Embree of Michael's Travel Centre, based in Westlake Village, California. ""And, if you go to day spas, rather than hotel spas, the prices are extremely reasonable."" Dinner for two at a luxury hotel could cost you from $50 to $70, and half that at a top local restaurant. Embree says that many of her clients stay in multiple hotels during a trip, just to experience the different kinds of luxury accommodations in Indonesia. ""Though spas, and to some degree, food, play a part, I think that the number one attraction for luxury clients is the accommodations,"" Embree says. Oregon wine country . It's peak harvest season in Oregon wine country, but you'll still pay less for hotels and other pleasures than you would in California's Napa Valley, Bowen says. ""Oregon offers more flexibility and a lower price point,"" Bowen says. ""You'll pay $40 to $50 per bottle of Pinot Noir, but it's worth it because you're saving money on your hotel and everything else."" Plus, Oregon isn't as much of a tourist destination as Napa, so you won't likely see a big tour bus of people going around to vineyards, she says. Bowen recommends staying at the Allison Inn & Spa in Willamette Valley, the best-known wine region in the state. Rooms start at $295 a night. ""It starts with where you stay,"" Bowen says. ""It's really important since you're going to be driving out from there every day.""","Favorable exchange rates and off-season values help travelers get the most for their money .
Visiting less-traveled destinations can often ensure lower prices and fewer people .
For great values, fall is the right time to visit places such as Curacao, Cambodia, Iceland ."
"Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- There is at present a profound uncertainty about currencies. That is why the president of the World Bank, Robert Zoellick, created such a stir with a brief reference to an enhanced role for gold in the course of a plea for a more sustainable international exchange rate system. The revival of interest in a golden measure of value derives from two fundamental sources. First, there is a question about our personal sense of worth. The aftermath of the economic crisis has destroyed our confidence in the reliability of conventional paper money. We need money as a store of value, but in the course of the crisis it has also become a tool of government policy. Looser monetary policy or ""quantitative easing"" can help to get the economy moving again. But the purposes of money may conflict and collide. When money becomes too much of a policy tool, the function of reliably measuring value gets chipped away. We look at gold when we are really upset about big price changes. Over the past two years, market sentiment has shifted abruptly from fear of deflation to fear of inflation. The crisis has produced a profound shock, in which some prices (especially housing) have moved sharply lower while others (notably foodstuffs and some raw materials) have increased. The movement of prices is actually an important part of the adjustment process: that is, Americans should devote less of their resources to building and filling mega-size houses. But the price changes involved are deeply discomforting: The prices that are falling represent a major store of wealth, because people viewed their house as a sort of source of cash; and the prices that are rising are a major part of daily expenditure. More opinion on topics in the news . The appeal of gold would be that it might be a better way of storing value. But it would not avoid the harsh task of adjustment at a personal level. Secondly, there is an international dimension to the concern with gold. The crisis has intensified international conflict. It has pushed countries to compete much more aggressively for markets, and to worry that other countries are using unfair means to push their exports. Americans think that China has maintained an artificially undervalued exchange rate, while Mediterranean countries accuse Germany of having devised the Euro as a monetary unit that gives Germany permanent cost advantages. Even former Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan now says that U.S. monetary policy is aimed at the weakening of the dollar. As a consequence, the victims start to retaliate. Both the rhetoric and the consequences in terms of exchange rate actions seem to recall the currency wars of the 1930s, when the world spiraled down into protectionism. Can the countries of the world sit down at a table and hammer out an agreement on what exchange rates can be? No previous attempt at such an exercise has been successful. The exchange rates adopted at Bretton Woods in 1944 needed to be extensively modified in the late 1940s, and the Smithsonian conference of 1971, which tried to work out a new system, broke down within a year and a half as countries ignored any need for monetary constraint. The appeal of gold is that it sets a clear limit on the extent to which policy actions can manipulate exchange rates. But for nations and individuals, it does not in any way remove the pain from living in altered circumstances. The gold standard worked reasonably well in the 19th century, but even then it did not produce complete price stability. In the absence of new sources of gold, it exerted a downward influence on prices; then, in the 1890s, new gold started to flow from South Africa, Australia and Alaska, and the result was mild inflation. A real effort at the monetization of gold today would produce a much more dramatic version of the same sort of logic. First, there would be a major scramble for gold and the current gold bubble would swell to even greater proportions. That would provide very large incentives to existing producers of gold in South Africa and Russia to intensify extraction, but also to others to look for nonconventional sources, such as the bulk processing of seawater to extract the very small gold content. The result would be an initial deflation and then a colossal inflation that would make the 19th century experience look trivial. The late-19th century critics who thought that there must be a better way of storing value than gold were right. But such a search demands sustained attention to methods of limiting the tendency of both individuals and governments to behave in a way that produces short-term gains while sacrificing the longer term good of stability. Self-limitation, rather than the magic fix of a new precious metal-based currency, should be the real golden rule. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Harold James.","People are profoundly uncertain about currencies, says Harold James .
He says sharp drops in housing prices and increases in commodities are causing fear .
James: Gold appeals to people because it limits governments' monetary policies .
Basing currencies on gold would result in deflation, then colossal inflation, says James ."
"(CNN) -- Grammy Award-winning artist Ricky Martin has long been passionate about helping others, serving as a UNICEF goodwill ambassador and working with Habitat for Humanity. But his main charitable focus is the Ricky Martin Foundation, which he founded to advocate for children around the world. This year, Martin served on the Blue Ribbon Panel that selected the Top 10 CNN Heroes of the Year. He recently spoke to CNN about the Heroes campaign and his philanthropy. Below are excerpts from that interview. CNN: What's the mission of the Ricky Martin Foundation? Ricky Martin: It's about children. It's about being their voice. Our mission is to advocate on behalf of children's rights and their well-being in three crucial areas: education, health and social justice. Through our principal project, People for Children, we combat child exploitation that results from human trafficking -- modern-day slavery. Children aren't just our future. They're our present. Unfortunately, there are children around the world that are being forced into slavery. I've heard those testimonies, and if we don't do something about it, we're allowing it to happen at this point. So it's been almost 10 years of intense work educating the world about this. Little by little, we're trying to create awareness that this goes on. CNN: Do you have any anecdotes about your work with your foundation? Maybe someone your organization has helped that you're particularly proud of? Martin: I have many, but rescuing three girls from the impoverished streets of India in 2002 ... was a rude awakening into the reality of human trafficking. It gave me the courage to establish People for Children, and drew the route to my path as an activist. And just recently listening to a boy who has been empowered by our anti-trafficking and leadership seminars, saying he wants to be a teacher for other children, was uplifting. These are moments of grand simplicity and profound awareness. CNN: Why is philanthropic work important to you, and how has it changed your life? Martin: I am convinced that music, like philanthropy, bridges hope. Once you learn about this heinous crime, you cannot turn a blind eye. Knowing that we have prevented children from falling prey to modern-day slavery or that a life was saved by our awareness efforts is invaluable to our mission and human spirit. CNN: What was it like being on the Blue Ribbon Panel that selected the Top 10 CNN Heroes? Martin: It was a very humbling experience. Their stories served as inspiration, and they also weave a canvas that [shows that] in spite of injustices, there are many warriors of light that make our world a better place. CNN: The CNN Heroes campaign honors everyday people doing extraordinary things. Why do you think it's important to honor the work that these individuals are doing? Martin: Kudos to CNN for honoring the work that human beings are doing around the world, because [these Heroes] are ""little gods,"" as I call them. They are making miracles with nothing. They are creating such a beautiful impact on different lives. CNN: What is a hero to you? What are the qualities of a hero? Martin: Heroes represent the best of ourselves, respecting that we are human beings. A hero can be anyone from Gandhi to your classroom teacher, anyone who can show courage when faced with a problem. A hero is someone who is willing to help others in his or her best capacity. It can be someone teaching another to write, saving someone in danger or giving up your life for another. Amongst the qualities a hero should have, I would include determination, loyalty, courage, perseverance, patience, focus, intrepidity and selflessness. CNN: Why is important for people to give back? Martin: It nourishes your soul and enhances the meaning of life.","Ricky Martin started his foundation to advocate for children around the world .

"(CNN) -- Mexico's war against the drug cartels is frustrated by a risk-averse army and interagency rivalries, according to U.S. diplomatic cables obtained by WikiLeaks. But amid some downbeat assessments of the challenges faced by President Felipe Calderon, some of the cables celebrate outstanding successes against the cartel ""capos."" One such success came almost exactly a year ago, when a Mexican naval unit killed one of Mexico's leading cartel figures, Arturo Beltran Leyva -- with plenty of assistance from the United States. ""The arrest operation targeting ABL began about a week prior to his death when the Embassy relayed detailed information on his location to SEMAR [Mexican Navy],"" according to a cable sent soon after the operation. The naval unit ""raided an identified location, where they killed several ABL bodyguards and arrested over 23 associates, while ABL and Hector [his brother] escaped."" But time was running out for Beltran Leyva (also known as El Fantasma and El Elegante), thanks to U.S. surveillance. The cable continues: ""the Embassy interagency linked ABL to an apartment building located in Cuernavaca (about an hour south of Mexico City), where ABL was in hiding.... ABL's forces fired on the SEMAR operatives and engaged in a sustained firefight that wounded three SEMAR marines and possibly killed one."" Besides Beltran Leyva, at least three other cartel operatives were killed during the Dec. 16, 2009, raid, with a fourth committing suicide. The success of the operation was especially pleasing to the United States because its military had spent years training Mexican naval units. Some might question why the navy was involved in a land operation. This and other cables provide the answer: The army had declined to act quickly on information about Beltran Leyva's whereabouts and is described as ""risk averse."" After the Beltran Leyva operation, there was glowing praise from U.S. diplomats for Mexican navy units. ""SEMAR is well-trained, well-equipped, and has shown itself capable of responding quickly to actionable intelligence,"" a cable read. ""Success puts the Army in the difficult position of explaining why it has been reluctant to act on good intelligence and conduct operations against high-level targets."" There is no euphoria about Beltran Leyva's demise, but the embassy hopes it will mark a new beginning. ""His death will not solve Mexico's drug problem, but it will hopefully generate the momentum necessary to make sustained progress against other drug trafficking organizations."" Since Beltran Leyva's death, Mexican security forces have scored some significant successes in arresting or killing leading cartel members, and often SEMAR units have been in the vanguard. Last month the Navy Ministry confirmed its forces shot and killed Ezequiel Cardenas Guillen, alias ""Tony Tormenta,"" one of the top members of the Gulf cartel. And, in January this year, there seemed to be optimism that some of the institutional challenges were at last being tackled. ""A truly joint effort to implement a new U.S.-Mexico strategy is yielding stronger organizational structures and interagency cooperation on both sides and a deeper understanding of the threat posed by the drug trafficking organizations,"" reads one cable. The same cable noted that the Mexican Army [SEDENA] had for the first time asked the United States for special forces training. ""We need to capitalize on these cracks in the door. Any retreat on engagement on our side will only reinforce SEDENA's instincts to revert to a closed and unaccountable institution.""","Diplomatic cables spell out successes against Mexican cartels .

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- U.S. President Barack Obama started his second day in India on a lighter note: pulling a few dance moves and celebrating a major religious festival with local students. Obama and first lady Michelle Obama spent Sunday morning at a local school, where students were celebrating Diwali. Youngsters performed dances in colorful saris to mark the festival of lights. The president bobbed his head to the music and clapped. Young girls danced with baskets on their heads as the room erupted in cheers. At one point, students pulled the first lady on stage and taught her how to twirl. ""Notice they didn't ask me,"" the president said. Students later extended the offer to the president, who joined them and towered over the youngsters as he danced. Obama also visited students at Holy Name High School, where students in school uniforms explained their projects to the president. One girl described her ""eco-friendly village"" with a large windmill. ""Did you guys get that -- a tree a day keeps global warming away,"" Obama told journalists. Obama also attended an agriculture exposition and took part in a town hall-style meeting with students at St. Xavier's College in Mumbai. He and the first lady then visited Humayun's Tomb, a magnificent architectural precursor to the Taj Mahal, before heading to New Delhi for a private dinner Sunday night with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. At the meeting with the students, Obama faced some difficult questions including his thoughts about jihad and why the United States doesn't consider Pakistan -- India's neighbor and rival -- a terrorist state. The president said it was necessary to isolate those who distort religion as a means for war, and said young people have a role in rejecting violence as a way to mediate differences. On Pakistan, Obama called it a country of enormous potential that had extremist elements. He acknowledged that progress against militants there was ""not as quick as we'd like,"" particularly in the difficult terrain of the northwest territories along the border with Afghanistan. Obama also said that India has the biggest stake in its neighbor's success, and that he hoped over time that the two nations develop further trust and cooperation. ""The United States stands to be a partner in that process, but can't impose that,"" Obama said. The relatively light agenda on the second day of Obama's 10-day, four-nation Asian trip followed the president's unveiling Saturday of about $10 billion in contracts for U.S. exports to India. ""The United States sees Asia, and especially India, as a market of the future,"" Obama said at a meeting with business leaders from both countries. ""For America, this is a jobs strategy."" Promoting broader trade relations with India is a delicate balancing act for Obama, given American frustration with the outsourcing of jobs to call centers in the country. But Obama said the notion of Indian outsourcing being a net drain on the U.S. economy is part of a ""caricature of India as a land of call centers and back offices that cost American jobs."" Obama's three-day visit to India, Asia's third largest economy and one of the world's few growth markets, also will include bilateral talks with Singh and an address to the the nation's parliament. After India, Obama will travel to Indonesia, then on to the G-20 meeting in South Korea and APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) summit in Japan.","NEW: The Obamas tour Humayun's Tomb .

"Harare, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- The wife of Zimbabwe's president has sued a Zimbabwean newspaper for $15 million following its publication of allegations that she was linked to and profited from illegal diamond sales in the southern African country. According to papers filed at the High Court in Harare Wednesday, Grace Mugabe, the wife of President Robert Mugabe, is suing The Standard for defamation after its report based on diplomatic cables released by the website WikiLeaks. The cables in question, from the U.S. Embassy in Harare, claimed that Zimbabwe's first lady was among the senior Zanu-PF and government officials who were gaining huge profits from the smuggling of diamonds in the eastern part of Zimbabwe. ""The diamonds that are sold to regime members and elites are sold for freshly printed Zimbabwean notes issued by the RBZ (Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe),"" the paper quoted a 2008 cable as saying. ""The cables suggested that (the head of the bank, Gideon) Gono kept the money printing press running to finance the purchase of diamonds and this could have accelerated hyperinflation, which eventually rendered the Zimbabwe dollar worthless,"" the newspaper charged. Grace Mugabe said in the suit that the report published Sunday by The Standard was ""false, scandalous, malicious and bent on damaging (her) reputation."" The documents said the newspaper wrongly suggested that Grace Mugabe had ""used her position as the First Lady to access diamonds clandestinely, enriching herself in circumstances in which the country was facing serious foreign currency shortages, which amounts should have been channeled to the fiscus. ""The imputation of such conduct on a person of such high standing, the mother of the nation, is to lower the respect with which she is held by all right thinking persons, to a point of disappearance,"" the lawsuit said. Chris Mhike, an attorney for the newspaper, said the summons is being studied ""and in due course we shall respond. ""But looking at most of the claims, so far, I can say they are just meant to harass the press,"" he said. Foster Dongozi, a spokesman for the Zimbabwe Union of Journalists, said the group was ""concerned"" about the lawsuit. ""We condemn suing newspapers for merely reproducing something which is in the public domain. It is one way of trying to frustrate access to information, and to squeeze newspapers out of existence. As a union, we are really concerned that a crackdown on journalists may resurface,"" he said.","The cables say Grace Mugabe and others profited from illegal diamond sales .

"(CNN) -- Snow fell in parts of the southeast Saturday, the leading edge of a powerful storm system that has prompted blizzard warnings in New York City and Boston and threatened to cause major travel headaches at the tail end of the holiday week. The National Weather Service has issued a blizzard warning for the New York City metropolitan area, from northeast New Jersey through Newark and New York, and including the entirety of both the Long Island and Connecticut coasts of the Long Island Sound. That warning is in effect between 6 a.m. Sunday and 6 p.m. Monday. Forecasters predict between 11 to 16 inches of blowing snow in much of that region, bringing visibility to near zero at times. Sustained winds as strong as 30 miles per hour could hit Sunday night, with gusts up to 55 mph in parts of central and eastern Long Island. And, starting at noon Sunday and extending through 6 p.m. Monday, a similar warning is out for all of Rhode Island and most of eastern Massachusetts. Parts of that region could see as much as 20 inches of snow, with strong winds contributing to near blinding travel conditions and likely significant power outages. The weather service also put out a blizzard watch from Sunday evening through Monday afternoon for coastal New Hampshire and Maine, up to the Canadian border. All this could put a wrench in thousands of travel plans. Continental Airlines, which is partnered with United Airlines, has canceled about 250 domestic mainline and regional departures for Sunday, spokesman Andrew J. Ferraro said. American Airlines spokeswoman Mary Sanderson said that the airline expected minimal delays through Sunday morning, but that it plans to cancel flights in and out of several key East Coast airports starting in the afternoon. ""Customers will be contacted through the automated re-accommodation system ... as early as tonight,"" Sanderson said. ""We'll have a better idea tomorrow morning."" Delta Air Lines, too, has begun cancelling some flights, though it expects to have a better handle of how many cancellations will be needed on Sunday morning ""once we've worked through the schedule,"" spokesman Kent Landers said. Earlier, the carrier cancelled approximately 500 Christmas Day flights -- including roughly 300 in and out of Atlanta -- in an attempt to get ahead of the storm, Delta spokesman Morgan Durrant said. Delta has joined Continental, United, American, AirTran Airways and other carriers in waiving penalties for travelers who have to reschedule their trips over the weekend. While specific information varies by carrier, most are offering penalty waivers for passengers traveling on December 26 and 27 at airports from North Carolina to Boston and beyond. Affected customers are being urged to contact the relevant airline either by phone or online. Winter storm warnings were in effect late Saturday afternoon and into Sunday in parts of Georgia north to Virginia, with the rest of the East Coast set to follow as the weekend progresses. A band of light snowfall was moving across the Tennessee Valley and the southern Appalachians, according to the National Weather Service. Madison, Alabama, had received 2.2 inches of snow since Thursday. Snowfall amounts of 3 to 6 inches were possible across North Carolina, and Atlanta was receiving afternoon precipitation. Picturesque Asheville in western North Carolina was well on its way Saturday to notching up to 8 inches of snow. Light flakes were falling in Washington on Saturday, a precurso to heavier snowfall expected to arrive midday Sunday. Accumulations are expected to be between 2 and 4 inches. Forecasters, too, warned of icy driving conditions across much of the East. Much of the precipitation will fall along the Interstate 95 corridor and near the Atlantic coast. CNN meteorologist Bonnie Schneider explained that the system is a Nor'easter, which gets its name from the continuously strong northeasterly winds blowing in from the ocean ahead of the storm and over the coastal areas. CNN's Nick Valencia contributed to this report.","NEW: Delta joins other carriers in cancelling flights, with more likely to come Sunday .

"(CNN) -- Uruguay's controversial World Cup star Luis Suarez has been given a seven-match suspension after being found guilty of biting an opposition player in a Dutch league match. The striker will miss six Eredivisie games as well as a Dutch Cup tie, ruling him out until his club Ajax's next league match at home to De Graafschap on February 4. The Amsterdam side's captain was punished by the Royal Netherlands Football Association following an incident in Sunday's 0-0 draw with PSV Eindhoven. The 23-year-old -- who was infamously sent off during the World Cup quarterfinal against Ghana in July after saving a goal-bound attempt with his hands -- was investigated after biting PSV player Otman Bakkal. ""Ajax and Luis Suarez have accepted the KNVB's settlement proposal of a seven-match suspension,"" said a statement on the club's website on Wednesday. Ajax had already fined Suarez and banned him for the club's next two domestic matches. ""The fine will go towards a charitable cause,"" Ajax said. Suarez, who played in Ajax's 4-0 defeat by Real Madrid on Tuesday night, will be available for the final Champions League Group G match at AC Milan on December 8. He was named the 2010 Dutch footballer of the year after scoring 49 goals in all competitions last season, and has now netted more than 100 times for Ajax since joining the club in 2007. Meanwhile, European football's ruling body UEFA will look at the red cards incurred by Real's Sergio Ramos and Xabi Alonso late in the Amsterdam match, the UK Press Association reported on Wednesday. Both players received second yellow cards for time-wasting late in the match, meaning they will miss the final group game against French club Auxerre. The Spanish club have already earned a place in the second round, and the duo's disciplinary is effectively wiped clean ahead of the two-legged last-16 tie in February and March. PA reported that if the players were ruled to have been purposefully booked, they could be charged and have their suspensions extended. Real Madrid coach Jose Mourinho denied that he had given such instructions to the duo. ""I spoke with many players throughout the game, not only with Ramos and Alonso,"" he told reporters. ""The two red cards were the result of strange referee bookings in an easy game to monitor. ""I didn't like them one bit, but if Ramos or Alonso can't face Auxerre, others will take their place. We will not give our game against the French away. We want to win all our matches.""","Ajax captain Luis Suarez punished following incident in Dutch Eredivisie match .

"(CNN) -- This world is a busy place with billions of people and billions of things to achieve and experience. It's easy to live a lifetime without knowing the feeling of helping others. But can you really blame people for making a way for themselves and not others? That's the message you get from birth: ""Go after your dreams and don't let anything or anyone keep you from it."" I hear people ask: ""What's in it for me?"" or ""Why should I help you, or them?"" Could it be that they were never taught the importance of helping others or know how much they could gain from it themselves? For me it wasn't someone, but more something, that made me realize the importance of helping others. It was simply visiting a place that some have never visited before -- and fighting for my life. After sustaining burn injuries while serving in the Army in Iraq in 2003 at 19 years old, I asked myself a notebook full of questions. The main one was: ""Why did this happen to me, and what am I going to do with it?"" As I carried on with my recovery, I waited for that answer. About six months after I was burned, I was asked to visit a young man in the same position as me. He was in the early stages of his recovery and hadn't been as physically injured as I was. Growing up, I wasn't as connected to helping other people because too much was catching my attention, typical teenage things like football and girls. Needless to say, walking into that young man's room when I was 20 and visiting him gave me more than any other experience ever gave me. It opened my eyes to a true purpose. I learned that I was able to have an impact on others and help them avoid the difficulties and challenges I faced in order to learn the many things I have learned. I do not regret what happened to me on April 5, 2003, because it has brought me to a special place and has given me so much from which to grow. I know I have so much more to experience and learn. I am living the America Dream, and that is being able to dream and make it a reality. Others do not have this opportunity because of a disruptive childhood, abusive relationships or limited resources. I went from fighting for my life to helping inspire others to fight for their own. I have had the honor of sharing my own life experiences with audiences throughout the world, and it has been a whirlwind. However, being able to hear others' stories and meet people who share the name ""Hero"" with me is even more amazing. I had the unbelievable honor to meet great people over the years, and most recently, at the CNN Hero Awards show in Los Angeles. I attended the show to support my friend Dan Wallrath, founder of Operation Finally Home, which provides custom-made homes to wounded and disabled veterans and the widows of the fallen in an effort to get their lives back on track and become productive members of their communities. He is a hero to many people. He didn't know much about the troops, but he knew how to build homes and wanted to give the troops what had been given to him and his family: hope, life, respect, acknowledgement and opportunity. Witnessing him being honored and also meeting nine other heroes  that night motivated me to continue the fight to give to others. So, ask yourself this question: Will you be someone's hero? If you reply yes, but don't know where to start, do as my friend Paul Rieckhoff, the executive director and founder of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, suggests. ""Instead of asking the question, 'What can I can do?' The real question is, 'What do you do best?' "" The more heroes we have, the better off our world will be. All of us can have an unimaginable effect on one person with the simple concept of making him or her  feel cared for, appreciated and that they matter.

"(CNN)  -- LeBron James led the much-vaunted Miami Heat to a morale-boosting Christmas Day victory over two-time defending NBA champions Los Angeles Lakers. James notched 27 points with 10 assists and 11 rebounds for the 31st triple-double of his career in the 96-80 win in the heavyweight clash on the Lakers' home court. Chris Bosh added 24 points and 13 rebounds for the Heat and Dwyane Wade chipped in 18 points despite a knee problem. Would you pay $500,000 to attend LeBron's birthday bash ? It was another chastening experience for the slumping Lakers and their talisman Kobe Bryant, after a 19-point home reverse to the Milwaukee Bucks four days previously. James, who moved to the star-studded Heat from Cleveland in a free agent summer move, was delighted by their performance, with stifling defense the key. ""That's Miami Heat basketball,"" James told AFP. ""We just try to go out and defend. We know that's going to give us the best chance to win. When we're in tune like that defensively -- five guys on a string, we're all helping each other out -- we're a pretty good team."" It was the first meeting between the two teams since James, Wade and Bosh joined up with Miami, making them one of the favorites for the NBA championship. A disgruntled Bryant was kept to 17 points, clearly losing is battle with fellow superstar James and the tension was evident at the end as they exchanged words. ""We're just two competitors, two guys just trying to will their team to victory,"" James said. Bryant's take: ""I just asked him what he got for Christmas."" Spain's Paul Gasol also scored 17 for the Lakers with Lamar Odom adding 14 points and nine rebounds, but they were well beaten.","Miami Heat beat two-time defending champions Los Angeles Lakers 96-80 .

"(CNN)  -- Brothers Wladimir and Vitali Klitschko have sent Britain's WBA world heavyweight champion David Haye a New Year message, saying they are both ready to fight him in 2011. Wladimir holds three of the current world heavyweight belts, Vitali has the prestigious WBC title, and Haye the other. Match-ups between Haye and the Ukrainian pair would help unify the heavyweight crown as well as being a money-spinner. Haye, who has made two successful defenses of his title, was due to fight Wladimir in 2009, but pulled out with a back injury. Meanwhile, Wladimir's bout with another Briton, Dereck Chisora, was called off earlier this month, with the triple champion citing injury, paving the way for an early clash with Haye. ""We promise that in 2011 the fight against Haye will come,"" read the statement, released through Bild.de. ""We want this fight at all costs. He may choose against which of us he wants us to step into the ring to lose his world title."" Haye's manager Adam Booth told the Press Association. ""We are now perfectly positioned to get together and make this fight with Wladimir Klitschko. ""Despite the fact we know we bring more UK television money to the table, David and I are happy to split the entire pot 50-50 and grant Wladimir the deal he has wanted since day one."" Vitali Klitschko said on Tuesday that his brother would be the first to take on the 30-year-old Haye, with him waiting in the wings. Chisora, upset when his fight with Wladimir Klitschko was pulled, has been promised another opportunity, but they may now have to wait. In world title action Sunday, Japan's Koki Kameda won the vacant World Boxing Association (WBA) bantamweight title by beating Alexander Munoz of Venezuela by a unanimous decision. The three judges scored it 115-111, 116-109 and 117-109, all in favor of Kameda. Kameda is the first Japanese boxer to win three world titles, following the WBA light flyweight title and the World Boxing Council (WBC) flyweight crown.","Klitschko brothers issue statement saying they want to fight Dave Haye in 2011 .

"(CNN) -- He earns millions of dollars every year, but basketball star LeBron James wants investors to splash out up to $500,000 each to sponsor his lavish 26th birthday celebrations. The Miami Heat player has hired a marketing firm to find backers willing to help fund his December 30 party, dubbed the ""Full Court Birthday Celebration."" James, who earned a reported $14.5 million in salary this year, enlisted SA Global Plus -- whose website shows slides from a presentation given to potential investors. The sponsorship opportunities range from $10,000 for a single event on his 11-stop ""LeBron James Dinner Party Tour"" to $500,000 for a season package. Next week's A-list party will take place at the Coco De Ville Lounge in Miami Beach's Gansevoort Hotel, and the presentation promises an array of stars including athletes, musicians and political figures who ""reinvent and set the tone for a chic lifestyle.""

It is not the first time the former Cleveland Cavaliers guard, who calls himself ""King James"" on his Twitter account, has attracted attention away from the basketball court. The six-time NBA All-Star ended months of speculation about his future in July, when he announced he would be joining the Heat on a live television special called ""The Decision.""

"(CNN) -- Dutch authorities have arrested 12 men of Somali origin they believe were about to carry out a terrorist attack, authorities said Saturday. The country's intelligence service provided information that led to the arrests in Rotterdam, Public Prosecution Service spokesman Wim de Bruin told CNN. No weapons or explosives were found, he said. The suspects are in police custody. ""The attack was said to be imminent so the national police started an investigation which led to the arrest of 12 Somalis later on Friday in Rotterdam,"" de Bruin said. ""We are not sure about what the target was, how they were going to carry out the attack or when."" A Dutch counterterrorism office spokeswoman said the immediate threat to the country has been removed and the terror alert level will remain ""limited,"" or relatively low. ""We are now following the information that comes out of the interrogations with these 12 individuals to see if there still remains a threat from this plot,"" said Judith Sluiter of the National Coordinator for Counterterrorism. The men, between ages 19 and 48, were arrested in various locations. Police have searched a pawn shop, four homes and two hotel rooms, de Bruin said. Six of the suspects live in Rotterdam and one is from Denmark. Some are Dutch citizens. They all are of Somali origin, de Bruin said. A spokesman for the Danish Security Service said authorities are in ""close contact"" with Dutch police. War-torn Somalia has a virtually powerless central government and is home to several militant groups, including Al-Shabaab, which controls much of the country . Al-Shabaab has claimed responsibility for several attacks, including a series of bombs that tore through an Ethiopian restaurant and a rugby center in the Ugandan capital of Kampala. Officials said the July 11 blasts, which killed 79 people, were probably set off by suicide bombers. The United States this year charged several people with trying to funnel money or otherwise assist Somali extremists. Al-Shabaab has been linked to al Qaeda. Somali President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed in September asked other countries to train Somalia's forces to help counter militant groups. The Netherlands is concerned about threats to Western countries, including itself, said Sluiter. She made a reference to the recent suicide bombing in Stockholm, Sweden. A 2009 Dutch intelligence report indicated a decreased threat from domestic militant networks. Domestic militants were becoming more focused on jihad outside the Netherlands, the report said. But it did say the country was seeing more jihadist threats from Somalia and Yemen. The report noted several cases of Dutch citizens trying to travel to Somalia to join Al-Shabaab, including four arrested in 2009 in Kenya. The arrests in the Netherlands followed an unrelated sweep a few days before in the United Kingdom. An operation Monday led by the British intelligence service, MI5, resulted in arrests of 12 suspects ranging in age from 17 to 28 in the cities of London, Stoke and Birmingham, England, as well as Cardiff, Wales. A senior British official not authorized to speak on the record said the suspects were arrested on suspicion of ""preparation or instigation of an act of terrorism in the UK,"" but he also said the suspects were ""aspirational"" rather than equipped and ""ready to go.""

"(CNN) -- A part of Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris was evacuated Friday due to the accumulation of snow on the roof and hundreds of flights were canceled because of a shortage of de-icing fluid, authorities said, as blustery winter weather snarled travel across Europe. Nearly 2,000 passengers were moved from Terminal 2E to other parts of the airport, French authorities said, calling the measure ""preventative."" Part of the roof of that terminal collapsed in 2004, shortly after the state-of-the-art building was inaugurated. Four people were killed, media reports at the time said. About a foot of snow had fallen on the roof Friday by the time authorities decided to close the terminal, French media reports said. Authorities were working to clear it and reopen the terminal. French authorities earlier Friday asked airlines to cancel half their morning flights to and from the airport because de-icing fluid was running low, they said. That led to the cancellation of 400 flights Friday morning -- 200 arrivals and 200 departures. Then, early in the afternoon, authorities asked airlines to scrap a third of their flights for the rest of the day. Charles de Gaulle is the second busiest airport in Europe, after Heathrow in London. By Friday evening, conditions there were improving, and flights on Christmas Day were predicted to depart as scheduled. Authorities have said that as many as 200 passengers may spend the night at the airport, where some 800 mattresses were set up in a makeshift dormitory. Elsewhere at Charles de Gaulle Friday, a chartered plane arrived safely carrying 84 Haitian children, who are to be adopted by French families, the government said. Medical and logistical supplies met the flight. Paris' second airport, Orly, has not had to cancel flights because it is not running out of glycol, which is using for de-icing, authorities said. Despite the winter weather, Air France said it intended to operate all of its flights between the Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports. It also said it intended to operate all of its long-haul flights. Airports across Europe are still struggling to get passengers to their destinations after they were snarled by unexpected snow over the weekend. In Brussels, heavy snowfall forced the closure of all but one runway, the airport said in a statement. It was only accepting a few flights, as the airport said it did not have sufficient capacity to handle incoming traffic. Heathrow, in London, said in a statement that it was open and that most flights would operate on Friday. London's Gatwick Airport similarly said it was open and that flights were operating, but it warned there may be some delays and cancellations because of snowfall across Northern Europe. Dublin, Ireland's airport was experiencing delays Friday because of de-icing and because airplanes were in the wrong places after the week's disruptions, the airport said in a statement. At the Frankfurt airport in Germany, most flights were operating as scheduled but some were scratched and others were delayed, said duty officer Heinz Fass. About 45 landings and 35 starts were canceled, he said, because of winter weather at other European airports. Meanwhile, the Swedish Transport Administration wrote on its website that the traffic situation was ""extremely alarming"" and that there were major problems with both road and rail traffic, especially in the southern parts of the country. The problems there are expected to continue through Christmas Day. CNN's Niki Cook and Per Nyberg contributed to this report.","Brussels airport says all but one runway shut because of heavy snowfall .

If there isn't one, we wonder: Can I ask to return this? Our experts answer that question: . Jodi Newbern, author of ""Regifting Revival: A Guide to Reusing Gifts Graciously"" I have a relative that returns or exchanges every gift they are given, even if it is something that they asked for. I just include the gift receipt and let it go. (Surprisingly, they hate gift cards and think they are tacky ... go figure!!) For most of us, unless the gift giver tells you that it's OK for you to return it -- wrong size, for example -- then returning or exchanging the gift should not be an option (unless you are a cad, or a relative, or both). Let's assume the gift giver thought you would really like what they chose for you. If you don't really want, need or like the gift, then after you've expressed appropriate gratitude, put it in your regift closet and do something else with it later. (Like use it for a ""spare""...!)

Sherri Athay, author of ""Present Perfect: Unforgettable Gifts for Every Occasion"" If there is a compelling and inoffensive reason to return the gift (wrong size, duplicate gift, damaged item, missing part), you might mention it to the giver and see if he/she offers to give you the receipt. In such cases, the giver might even offer to make the exchange for you. On the other hand, if there is any potential that making known your intentions to return the gift might hurt the giver's feelings, don't ask. Try making the exchange/return without a receipt (most stores will at least give store credit), or regift the item to someone you know is a better fit. From our readers .

"(CNN) -- Missouri police are investigating the death of a 27-year-old woman whose body was found at the home of beer tycoon August Busch IV. Frontenac, Missouri, police officers got a 911 call just before 1:15 p.m. on Sunday, December 19, about an unresponsive woman at a residence later identified as belonging to Busch, the town's police chief, Thomas Becker, said in a press release. Paramedics and police officers arrived eight minutes later to find Adrienne Nicole Martin dead, ""with no apparent signs of trauma or other indications of cause of death,"" Becker said. Busch's lawyer, Art Margulis, described Martin as a friend of his client. ""There's absolutely nothing here that would indicate that this occurred under any suspicious circumstances,"" said Margulis. ""It's a tragic death of a ... very nice young lady."" Frontenac police said they are investigating the death with help from the St. Louis County medical examiner. The community of about 3,500 people is 11 miles west of St. Louis. Martin was a model and aspiring art therapist, described as Native American on her page on iStudio.com, a service that says it serves ""the modeling, photography, and associated industries."" In the About Me section of her page, she writes that she had been in beauty pageants for years and ""would really like to do beer advertising."" Busch, 46, became chief executive officer of Anheuser-Busch in December 2006, after years of working in the company's brewing, operations and marketing divisions. He was in charge in 2008 when Belgian brewer InBev engineered a $52 billion takeover of the then-St. Louis, Missouri, company. With that move, the combined Anheuser-Busch InBev became the world's largest brewer. ""It was a very difficult time, when August Busch IV took over,"" said Julie MacIntosh, author of the book ""Dethroning the King,"" which focuses on the last decade of Anheuser-Busch. ""On a personal level, it was difficult for (August Busch IV) when the company was taken over."" He and several other members of his family, including his father and fellow former CEO August Busch III, took home tens of millions of dollars from the move, said MacIntosh. That also largely ended the Busch family's long legacy in brewing, namely heading the legendary eastern Missouri institution known for its Budweiser and other brands. The story started with Adolphus Busch, the company founder and August Busch IV's great-great-grandfather. August Busch IV is the only representative of the family -- and its former namesake company -- on the Anheuser-Busch InBev board of directors.","August Busch IV is the only member of his family on Anheuser-Busch InBev's board .

"(CNN) -- The worst might be over on Indonesia's Mount Merapi volcano, disaster officials said Thursday. They urged calm in the aftermath of recent eruptions, which started on October 26 and have killed 191 people. ""Generally speaking, Mount Merapi has passed its dangerous phase,"" the National Agency for Disaster Management said. It cited recent eruptions versus historic ones. Merapi's recent eruptions have released about 140 million cubic meters of magma, the disaster agency said. The previous record flow occurred in 1872, at 100 million cubic meters. The information was released in an attempt to reassure Indonesians, especially those in the Yogyakarta and Central Java area. Despite that, government volcanology experts have kept Merapi's alert level at 4, the highest. On Wednesday, the Merapi Disaster Health Team said that the recent eruptions have seriously injured 145 people, and left scores of others less severely hurt. The eruptions have displaced nearly 344,000 residents, many who are now living in refugee camps, the National Agency for Disaster Management said. To restore a sense of normalcy for displaced students, classes have started at the camps, disaster officials said Thursday. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has called the volcano eruptions a crisis situation. Over the weekend, he and several of his ministers visited Yogyakarta to oversee relief efforts. On Thursday, disaster officials said dredging has begun. The work is being done to limit further destruction. ""We've taken steps to anticipate possible lava floods from upstream,"" said Syamsul Maarif, the head of the National Agency for Disaster Management. The 3,000-meter (9,800-foot) Merapi, in Central Java, is famously unpredictable. About 1,300 people died when it erupted in 1930. Many people continue to live in the shadow of the volcano, raising food and livestock. The president has announced that residents will receive compensation for livelihoods and animals lost to the eruptions. The government will buy endangered cows on the volcano, Yudhoyono said. Many of those who live on its slopes risked their lives by staying or returning to feed their cows during lulls of volcanic activity. CNN's Kathy Quiano contributed to this report.","Generally speaking, Mount Merapi has passed its dangerous phase,"" the government says .

"(CNN) -- Antonio Margarito has apologized for mocking Manny Pacquiao's Parkinson's disease-afflicted boxing trainer Freddie Roach in a video that has spread like wildfire across the Internet. The Mexican-American boxer made a surprise appearance at Thursday's press conference for the undercard bout between Brandon Rios -- who was also in the video -- and Omri Rowther in a bid to make peace ahead of Saturday's fight in Arlington, Texas. ""I want to apologize to everyone, Freddie Roach if he will accept my apologies,"" said Margarito, who was filmed shaking his hands in mock horror when a journalist told him Roach said Pacquiao would win by a knockout. ""To everyone with that disease ... I want to tell you, never, ever in my life would I make fun of anyone like that. I just want to let you know that I'm not the kind of person who would do anything like that, and make fun of anyone."" Rios also said sorry to the 50-year-old for his part in the viral clip, which was posted on video sharing website YouTube on Wednesday and showed the American boxer violently shaking his head and stammering. ""It was a bad video from my behalf. Things got heated up in the moment. And I'm sorry. I feel bad for saying it. Nothing personal. I feel bad,"" he said. Robert Garcia, who trains both Maragarito and Rios, told reporters at the conference that he had spoken to Roach and his opposite number had accepted the apology. ""I told him, 'Freddie Roach, I want to tell you that I'm very sorry for what happened. Now that I am talking to you, I feel much better,' "" Garcia said, adding that Roach replied: ""I accept your apology. And best of luck this weekend."" Roach said he had been angry about the video, but was prepared to move on, the Sweet Science boxing site reported on Thursday. ""I wanted to fight them at first, of course I'm a little too old,"" he said. ""I was very upset at first, I had trouble sleeping, thinking what to do about it. I thought it's best to take the high road, chalk it up to experience. ""They made a mistake, went too far -- but I think they should apologize to world and not just me. They went a little bit too far, tried to get under my skin but they're attacking a group of people -- not just me has Parkinson's. ""They apologized, they made a mistake, I accept it, let's get to the fight. I will not let it get to me or my fighter -- my fighter is smart and will stick to the game plan. They went a little bit too far, but we can all do that at times. I don't think they meant any harm in it."" Pacquiao and Margarito are fighting for the vacant WBC junior middleweight title at Cowboys Stadium, with Filipino fighter seeking to claim a belt in an unprecedented eighth class. It is Pacquiao's second visit to the venue, having retained his WBO welterweight title there against Nigeria's Joshua Clottey in March. Margarito comes into the fight with a record of 38 wins from 45 bouts, having won both the WBO and IBF welterweight titles. However, the 32-year-old was mired in controversy after he was found to have used illegal handwraps during his WBA title defeat by Shane Mosley in January 2009, leading to him being banned by the California State Athletic Commission. He returned in May to win the vacant WBC International light middleweight title from Roberto Garcia before being signed up by promoter Bob Arum, with Pacquiao still unable to seal a deal for his dream clash with Floyd Mayweather Junior.","Boxing trainer Freddie Roach angry after being mocked in a video posted on Internet .

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- China's Foreign Ministry has confirmed for the first time that President Hu Jintao will visit the United States early next year. The trip will be ""profound and far-reaching for bilateral ties,"" state-run media reported, saying that preparations have begun for the visit. ""China and the United States have maintained close communications about the visit, which will be very important and will bring far-reaching influence for bilateral relations in new era,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Ma Zhaoxu said Thursday, according to China Daily. U.S. President Barack Obama referred to Hu's visit last month, while China's Premier Wen Jiabao was in New York to address the U.N. General Assembly. The countries ""have to work cooperatively together in order to achieve regional peace and stability, because the world looks to the relationship between China and the United States as a critical ingredient on a whole range of security issues around the world,"" Obama also said at the time. Relations between the two countries have hit rough patches in the past year. Washington has been pressing Beijing to allow its currency to appreciate more freely. Some critics in the United States have accused China of manipulating the yuan, giving its exports an edge in the global marketplace. China also broke off military ties early this year over the U.S. sale of arms to Taiwan, which Beijing regards as a breakaway province. The defense chiefs for China and the United States met last week, signaling a warming of relations between the countries. Chinese Defense Minister General Liang Guanglie and U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates talked in Vietnam, while they attended a security forum of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.

"(CNN) -- Keisuke Honda is the rising star of Japanese football. The 24-year-old has been likened to a Japanese David Beckham, both as an attacking midfielder with devastating free-kick skills, and as a pin-up with a distinctive off-the-pitch style. But the CSKA Moscow player would rather be known for his own achievements. ""I'm not [Beckham] and I don't think I can ever become him. I want to create something by myself, out of my own individuality. I want to show the world myself, not copying other people,"" he told CNN. ""Like any other football player I want to be number one, professionally. But on the other hand, I want to work on my appearance while I'm working on my football skills, pointing out that a best football player can be the most handsome one, too. These are probably the two ideas which help me express myself."" By plying his trade in Europe he's already achieved more than most Asian footballers. A large part of his drive to succeed comes from a disciplined upbringing -- ""[my father] would always get mad at me if I wasn't the best"" -- that fostered in Honda a competitive instinct and strong work ethic. He first played for J-League team Nagoya Grampus 8 before spending two seasons with Dutch side VVV-Venlo; he moved to Moscow in December 2009. Despite joining the Russian side for a fee of around $13 million less than a year ago there is speculation that Honda will move to a top club possibly in Italy, Spain or England later this winter. If the footballer had his wish there would only be one destination: ""When I was a little kid I loved Real Madrid. If I could play for that club, it would be a huge personal achievement for me. I think my dreams would come true then. To achieve that, I need to work really hard. Today is what matters. So, day after day, I concentrate and I work hard. And maybe in the future Real Madrid will invite me to join the club,"" he said. Honda has made his mark during his time in Moscow, helping the team make the group stages of the UEFA Champions League last season. His good form continued through the summer with Japan in the World Cup, scoring the winning goal against Cameroon. Honda however is candid about the national team's chances of greater success in the future. ""There are several problems. I think our main problem is... there are no really strong strikers. We don't know very well how to score. If the Japanese team can work on that weakness, we will become a country with a football team that deserves respect on the highest level,"" he said. And Honda is determined to do whatever it takes to play consistently at the highest level. ""A constant pressure is something that this sport won't exist without. I will keep on feeling this pressure as long as I am playing. Without it, it wouldn't be exciting. I'm planning on following a principle of high risk and high return, aiming only at the highest goals.""

"London, England (CNN) -- An employee at London's Heathrow Airport has been given a police warning after allegedly making a lewd remark about a female colleague as she stood in a full body scanner by mistake. The woman reported the incident to airport bosses and to police, according to the UK's Press Association. ""Police received an allegation regarding an incident that happened at Heathrow Terminal 5 on March 10,"" a Metropolitan Police spokesman told PA. ""A first instance harassment warning has been issued to a 25-year-old male."" A spokeswoman for BAA, which runs the airport, said that the allegations were being investigated and that ""appropriate action"" would be taken if the claims were substantiated. ""We treat any allegations of inappropriate behavior or misuse of security equipment very seriously and these claims are investigated thoroughly,"" she told PA. Heathrow and other British airports introduced full body scanners earlier this year as part of tougher security measures introduced following an attempt to blow up a Detroit-bound airliner from Amsterdam on December 25 last year. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said that scanners were necessary to combat ""a new type of threat."" But critics say the scanners breach people's privacy rights. ""This incident highlights the risks to privacy and respect for human dignity that are posed by the use of full body scanners,"" said Susie Uppal of the UK's Equality and Human Rights Commission.

"Moscow, Russia (CNN) -- A Russian lawmaker is calling for a special investigation into a top intelligence official's alleged release of information on a Russian spy ring in the United States. The deputy chairman of the Russian parliament's security committee wants a special commission to analyze how information on the Russian agent got out, said Alyona Zhukova, a spokeswoman for lawmaker Gennady Gudkov's office. Zhukova said the lawmaker had confirmed a newspaper report identifying a colonel in Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service as the source who tipped off U.S. officials. And the lawmaker sees the information as a significant blow to the image of Russia's intelligence network, she said. The article, published in the respected Russian newspaper Kommersant Thursday, said ""the betrayer,"" known as ""Colonel Shcherbakov,"" fled Russia three days before Russia's president arrived in the U.S. for meetings with President Barack Obama -- just days before ring was broken up. Neither the U.S. State Department nor the Central Intelligence Agency would comment on the report. The paper quotes a source who says the U.S., fearing that the Russian intelligence agency would pull its agents from the U.S., rounded them up and arrested them. In July, 10 Russian agents were handed over by the United States in exchange for four Russian prisoners. The article in Kommersant says Shcherbakov, who was identified only by last name, headed up the branch of the Foreign Intelligence Service that oversees agents working abroad undercover but without diplomatic credentials. ""We know who he is and where he is. He betrayed either for the money or he was caught for something. And there's no doubt that there is a Mercader has been sent for him,"" an unidentified source was quoted as telling Kommersant. Mercader was an assassin sent by Stalin to Mexico to kill Leon Trotsky in 1940. ""He doesn't have an enviable fate,"" the source tells the paper. ""He will drag this with him for the rest of his life and every day he will fear vindication."" The paper says that Shcherbakov was present in the facility in the U.S. where one of the spies arrested this summer was held. It claims he also took the files on one of those spies with him to the United States. The colonel's son also fled Russia for the United States not long before the spies were arrested, according to the paper. CNN's Arkady Irshenko, Jill Dougherty and Anastasia Anashkina contributed to this report.","A Russian lawmaker wants a commission to analyze how a top official leaked the information .

"(CNN) -- A leading spokesman for WikiLeaks has said he is stepping down, citing organizational shortcomings and clashes with the group's founder. Daniel Domscheit-Berg, who was known as Daniel Schmitt while acting as spokesman, said the whistle-blower website has structural problems stemming from its rapid growth, the German magazine Der Spiegel reported Monday. WikiLeaks was thrust into the international spotlight earlier this year when it released some 76,000 pages of U.S. documents related to the war in Afghanistan. ""Because of the high pressure we have all been under following the publication of the American military documents, we have not been able to restructure our organization accordingly. This has created a situation in which not all of the work is being done correctly, and that is overwhelming the project,"" Domscheit-Berg said, according to Der Spiegel. ""WikiLeaks has a structural problem. I no longer want to take responsibility for it, and that's why I am leaving the project,"" he said. Domscheit-Berg is one of a handful of people to have spoken on behalf of WikiLeaks, as the task typically falls to the website's founder, Julian Assange. Domscheit-Berg told Der Spiegel he had clashed with Assange over what he saw as the founder's increasing concentration of resources on fewer and larger leaks, and over whether Assange should take a more back-seat role following the rape and molestation allegations made against him in Sweden last month. ""In my opinion it would have been best if he (Assange) had pulled back a bit so that he could quietly deal with these problems. It would have been fine if he had continued his normal work out of the spotlight. But he clearly saw my internal proposal as an attack on his role,"" Der Spiegel reported Domscheit-Berg said. According to the account, and a posting on Wikileaks' Twitter page, Domscheit-Berg was suspended from the organization about a month ago. ""Julian Assange reacted to any criticism with the allegation that I was disobedient to him and disloyal to the project. Four weeks ago, he suspended me -- acting as the prosecutor, judge and hangman in one person,"" Domscheit-Berg told Der Spiegel. WikiLeaks has previously said it plans to publish another 15,000 documents related to the war in Afghanistan soon, while Domscheit-Berg told the German magazine the group has additional leaks in the works. ""Through our rising recognition in the last six months, we have again received a lot of material that urgently needs to be processed and published,"" he said.","Daniel Domscheit-Berg says WikiLeaks has a structural problem .

"(CNN) -- A cargo ship seized by Somali pirates off the coast of Kenya was freed Monday after one day under siege, and the German-based Beluga Shipping company said its crew of 16 was unharmed. The pirates were thwarted after the crew of the MV Beluga Fortune locked themselves in a panic room and switched off the main engine, cut off the fuel supply, blocked the bridge and reported the Indian Ocean attack to military forces, said Niels Stolberg, president and CEO of Beluga Shipping GmbH. The pirates, seeking a million-dollar ransom, were unable to maintain control of the vessel, and naval forces were able to come to the rescue, Stolberg said in a statement. The vessel continued its journey to Richards Bay, South Africa.

"(CNN) -- A German citizen of Afghan descent was the source of much of the information on a potential ""Mumbai-style"" terror plot in Europe, a German counterterrorism official said Wednesday. The man, Ahmed Sidiqi, was detained in Kabul in July and transferred to U.S. custody where he has ""revealed details about the terror plot,"" said the official, who did not want to be named because he is not authorized to talk to the media. The man and several other Germans traveled from Hamburg to the Afghan-Pakistan border area in 2009, where he joined the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, an extremist group allied with al Qaeda, German intelligence officials said. Sidiqi, once captured, ""started to talk a lot,"" and detailed a ""Mumbai-style"" attack in Europe, the German official said. Eiffel Tower evacuated after bomb threat . Ten men launched a carefully planned attack on buildings in Mumbai, India, on November 26, 2008. The attack on such prominent sites -- such as the Taj Mahal Palace and Tower hotel, the Oberoi-Trident hotels, the historic Victoria Terminus train station and a Jewish cultural center -- lasted three days and killed 164 people. Sidiqi is from Hamburg where he worked for a cleaning company at the Hamburg international airport, the German official said. He attended the Masjid Taiba mosque, formerly known as the Al-Quds mosque, in Hamburg, which became known as the meeting place of those behind the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington. Among those who prayed there was Mohammad Atta, one of the hijackers who commandeered the first plane that crashed into New York's World Trade Center. Sidiqi was part of Atta's circle, the official said. Hamburg shut down the mosque this year, not long after Sidiqi's capture. National Intelligence Director James Clapper would not talk about a plot Tuesday evening. ""We are not going to comment on specific intelligence, as doing so threatens to undermine intelligence operations that are critical to protecting the U.S. and our allies,"" he said. ""As we have repeatedly said, we know al Qaeda wants to attack Europe and the United States."" Meanwhile, a federal law enforcement official in the United States, said ""the volume seems to be turned up"" on the threat information coming out of Europe. The intelligence indicates there is interest in using people with Western passports in an attack, that official said. This source says the potential operatives may be a mix of Europeans and others possibly including North Africans, Pakistanis, Turks, Uzbeks, and Tajiks. There is concern about an ""active shooter"" scenario that would create as many casualties and as much chaos as possible in a short period of time. The Mumbai attacks showed how effective this kind of an attack can be in drawing attention. According to this source, economic targets in Europe could be possible targets, including institutions such as banks and stock exchanges. A separate law enforcement source said ""the belief is"" that Osama bin Laden signed off on a European attack plan, and that source confirmed the intelligence related to a Mumbai-style attack. The German government is increasingly concerned about the number of Germans becoming jihadists. According to a senior German counterterrorism source, some 200 individuals have traveled to train with Jihadist groups in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region since the 9/11 attacks. The potential plot against Europe was one factor contributing to the uptick this month in missile strikes by unmanned drones against terrorist targets in Pakistan, according to a U.S. official. ""We would be remiss not to try to take action to thwart what might be under way in Europe,"" said the official. The official emphasized that the potential plot was not the sole factor. U.S. officials say they are taking advantage of what they call ""precise intelligence."" Most of the drone attacks this year have been focused on North Waziristan, a mountainous area bordering Afghanistan where Pakistani security forces have little control. That has continued to be the pattern this month. Based on information from Pakistani officials, CNN estimates there have been 20 drone attacks in the area in September alone, a higher number than in any previous month, and more than twice the monthly average. Acknowledging the spike, one U.S. official told CNN: ""Our operational tempo has been up for a while now, we have good information driving it, and given the stakes involved, we hope to keep the pressure on as long as we can."" According to the official, the mix of threats remains the same. It comes from groups like the Haqqani network, al Qaeda, the Afghan Taliban and the Pakistan Taliban. The threats they pose are ""all deadly,"" said the official. Pakistani officials say many recent strikes have been aimed at compounds in or around the town of Miramshah, a stronghold of the Haqqani network. Western intelligence officials have long regarded the Haqqanis as one of the most dangerous terror groups and have linked them to several attacks in Kabul. Intelligence analysts point to other reasons for the escalated drone attacks. They include better information from sources in the border area and better surveillance technology -- including the growing use of spy balloons fitted with high-powered cameras. In addition, the rising number of drone strikes is designed to deprive the Afghan Taliban of ""strategic depth"" as the Obama administration's campaign to defeat the insurgency enters a crucial phase and tighten the noose on the senior al Qaeda leadership. Pakistani officials say one strike last weekend killed Sheikh Mohammad Fateh al Masri, described as the group's senior operational commander. CNN's Pam Benson, Tim Lister and Jeanne Meserve contributed to this report.","NEW: Clapper: We're not going to comment on specific intelligence .

"Mexico City, Mexico (CNN) -- Mexican officials have identified 13 people killed Sunday night in a Tijuana drug rehabilitation center, the state-run news agency said Monday. Four heavily armed men stormed into the Centro de Rehabilitacion El Camino and opened fire, the Notimex news agency said. The reported ages of those killed ranged from 19 to 56 years old. The assailants escaped in a vehicle, the news agency said. The dead were identified as: Irineo Godinez Garcia, 47; Antonio Mesa Contreras, 56; Bernabe Alvarez Piceno, 35; Jose Lopez Sauceda, 28; Fabian Gonzalez Zea, 19; Juan Daniel Casi Esquer, 32; Wilson Ramírez Pena, 42; Joaquin García Hernandez, 39; Jorge Palacio Goya, 37; Pedro Villegas, 30; Juan Roberto Sanchez Ortega, 30; Edwin Vargas Avila, 33; and Salvador Bustos, 30. The slayings occurred one day after armed men burst into a house party in Ciudad Juarez and opened fire, killing 14 people and wounding 14, Notimex said. The ages of those killed in Juarez ranged from 14 to 30, Notimex said. Children as young as 7 and 11 were among the injured, the agency reported. The attack in Juarez was reminiscent of an incident in January, when drug cartel gunmen stormed a house party and killed 15 people. Most of the victims were youths who had no ties to organized crime. Investigators said the January shooting was a case of mistaken identity caused by bad intelligence. It sparked widespread outrage in the violent border city, including calls for Mexican President Felipe Calderon to resign. The Tijuana slayings also were similar to previous attacks carried out at drug rehab centers. A massacre at a Juarez rehab facility in early June left 19 dead. Twenty-seven people were killed in September 2009 in two attacks at separate drug facilities in Ciudad Juarez, the bloodiest city in the nation. Officials said the previous attacks were done by drug gangs killing members of other gangs. At least 2,500 people have been reported killed in drug violence this year in Ciudad Juarez. Nationwide, more than 28,000 people have died in drug-related violence since December 2006, when Calderon took office and stepped up efforts to fight organized crime and narcotrafficking cartels. Much of the violence in Ciudad Juarez and other areas of northern Mexico is due to the drug cartels fighting for control of lucrative routes into the United States, authorities have said.","NEW: The attack is similar to previous killings at drug rehab centers .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Volunteers flocked to a southern California community to help residents mop up last week's flood damage ahead of what meteorologists are predicting will be more rain. Five homes were destroyed and nearly 75 damaged in the San Bernardino County community of Highland when water and mud rushed through the foothill town last week, authorities said. Total damage, including the cost of cleanup and lost property value, could hit $17.2 million, according to the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department. ""We feel very fortunate to have all these volunteers just help out, without even getting paid. They're just trying to do something good for the community,"" Cesar Garcia told CNN affiliate KABC. Garcia spoke inside his home, still steeped in mud. Outside, unstable hillsides were covered in plastic while as many as 600 volunteers worked to clear the debris. They laid sandbags in a bid to divert future water flows in preparation for more rainfall, which is expected soon. The National Weather Service has forecast a storm moving into the area late Tuesday night into Wednesday. CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said the storm should be much smaller than the one last week, but that it could dump as much as two inches of rain or two feet of snow in the mountains of California. Because the ground is already wet, the storm could cause problems, he said. Last week, monsoon-like conditions overwhelmed southern California, creating flash floods that kept workers at home and businesses and streets knee deep in mud and water.","The community of Highland was flooded last week .

"(CNN) -- Former Secretary of State Colin Powell said Monday that he has ""no interest"" in government service in response to a recently televised suggestion by Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell that President Obama name Powell as White House chief of staff. ""I haven't been asked, and I don't expect to be asked,"" Powell told CNN's ""Larry King Live"" in an interview set to air Monday night. ""... I don't expect to be asked because I've had 40 years of government service ... I have no interest in government service."" Instead, the retired Army general suggested Rendell would be a better pick. ""He's been running around throwing my name around,"" Powell said. ""This is the first chance I've had to suggest that Ed Rendell is an accomplished politician, accomplished governor, mayor of a great city. I think he'd be a terrific chief of staff."" Pete Rouse has been serving as interim White House chief of staff since Rahm Emanuel exited the post October 1 to run for mayor of Chicago, Illinois. An increasing number of senior Democrats inside and outside the White House say it's looking more likely that Rouse will stay on. Powell, who served as secretary of state from 2001 to 2005 under President George W. Bush, also reflected on the results of this month's midterm elections, calling them ""more than a shellacking"" against Obama. ""The American people are losing some focus on President Obama, what he's trying to do,"" he said. ""And when you look at the election results, as he said, I mean he got shellacked. But I think it was more than a shellacking, I think it was a real body blow that he now has to reflect on and figure out how to come back."" Powell also addressed the controversial waterboarding interrogation technique that gained a level of infamy during the Bush administration, saying he wouldn't support the practice now. ""The president of the United States, who has a responsibility to protect the American citizens, felt that, in that circumstance, waterboarding was appropriate, and as he clearly said, approved it and takes responsibility for the approval of it,"" Powell said. ""I think subsequently, as you kind of go down the years and take a look at what has happened over the years, I think it could now be called torture."" Powell noted that the FBI and other intelligence agencies have downplayed the quality of information the technique elicits, saying authorities can get better tips ""through more vigorous and professional interrogation."" ""But the president of the United States is the one that is responsible for our safety and at that time the one thing we were most concerned about is to make sure we get everything we need to prevent another 9/11 attack,"" he said. Bush recently took responsibility for the go-ahead for waterboarding terror suspects in his memoir ""Decision Points,"" released earlier this month.","Colin Powell responds to suggestion he be named White House chief of staff .

"(CNN) -- Emergency crews in the Philippines were on standby Monday morning as the island nation braced for a ""super typhoon"" that could trigger flooding and landslides. Super Typhoon Megi, also known as Juan, is expected to make landfall midday Monday at or near super-typhoon strength, with winds possibly in excess of 200 kph (124 mph), according to Mario Montejo, secretary of the Philippines' science and technology. On Monday morning, Megi carried sustained winds of 287 kph (178 mph) with gusts up to 350 kph (217 mph) as it headed toward the Philippines, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center said. ""Tropical storm force winds and heavy rain squalls are already affecting areas along the coast,"" CNN meteorologist Taylor Ward said. ""From this point forward the weather conditions are expected to rapidly deteriorate."" CNN meteorologist Ivan Cabrera called Megi a ""monster storm."" Beyond high winds, large swaths of the northern island of Luzon will see 300 mm (12 inches) of rain, while more isolated pockets may see up to 500 mm (20 inches), Ward said. A typhoon of this intensity could cause storm surge as high as 6 to 8 meters, threatening population centers along the coast. As of 5 p.m. (5 a.m. ET) Sunday, the typhoon was about 390 kilometers east of Aparri, Cagayan, according to the state-run Philippines News Agency. It was moving west at about 22 kph. Montejo said the government is alarmed by the speed and strength of the typhoon. He warned of potentially devastating effects the storm may wreak on Luzon. ""The winds have been steadily increasing,"" James Reynolds, a storm chaser who is on Luzon, told CNN Monday morning. ""Unfortunately, this is a part of the world where the infrastructure is quite fragile, the power grid is quite fragile and a lot of people live in quite basic houses,"" he said. Residents in low-lying and coastal areas are advised to head for safer locations, and authorities are discussing the possibility of forced evacuations. As the storm moves across the rugged terrain of Luzon, it is expected to decrease in intensity before moving out over the South China Sea. Megi is expected to dump large amounts of rainfall over the mountains, which could potentially trigger mudslides and localized flooding. The typhoon could also damage large amounts of agricultural land along its path. ""Thousands of hectares are in danger of being ruined,"" Cabrera said. On Sunday, Philippine navy spokesman Lt. Col. Edgard Arevalo said in a statement that disaster response personnel equipped with rubber boats and other life-saving equipment are on standby in several areas.","NEW: Super Typhoon Megi carries sustained winds of about 287 kph (178 mph)

"(CNN) -- A 2009 helicopter crash in which eight people died was due to a bird striking the chopper's windshield, the National Transportation Safety Board said Wednesday. ""Contributing to the accident, the board said, were the lack of [Federal Aviation Administration] regulations and guidance requiring helicopter windshields to be resistant to bird strikes,"" among other factors, the NTSB said in a news release. On January 4, 2009, a dual-engine Sikorsky S-76C helicopter crashed into marshy terrain near Morgan City, Louisiana, about seven minutes after takeoff from Amelie, Louisiana. The copter was on a charter flight to a Gulf of Mexico oil rig. Both pilots were killed, along with six of the seven passengers, according to the NTSB. Heard on the helicopter's cockpit voice recorder was a ""loud bang, followed by sounds consistent with rushing wind and a power reduction on both engines,"" according to the statement. ""The aircraft crashed several seconds later."" Feathers and other debris, identified as belonging to a red-tailed hawk, were collected from the helicopter's canopy and windshield, the NTSB said. Investigators believe the bird's impact jarred the fire extinguisher T-handles loose and moved them aft, which pushed both engine control levers into the flight idle position, reducing fuel to both engines, the statement said. ""The pilots were probably disoriented from the broken windshield and rushing air and were unable to react in time to maintain control of the helicopter."" The helicopter was registered to and operated by PHI Inc., the board said. The helicopter initially was equipped with laminated glass windshields that complied with European bird-strike resistance standards, but PHI had replaced them with lighter-weight acrylic windshields without bird-strike resistance. The crash occurred just days before pilot Chesley Sullenberger and co-pilot Jeffrey Skiles landed a US Airways flight in the Hudson River at New York City after a bird strike to the engines. Only a few minor injuries were reported. The January 15 landing made heroes of Sullenberger and his crew.","Eight people died in the January 2009 crash in Louisiana .

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Senate approved a $1.15 billion measure Friday to fund a settlement initially reached between the Agriculture Department and minority farmers more than a decade ago. The 1997 Pigford v. Glickman case against the U.S. Agriculture Department was settled out of court 11 years ago.  Under a federal judge's terms dating to 1999, qualified farmers could receive $50,000 each to settle claims of racial bias. ""This is much long overdue justice for black farmers,"" said John Boyd, founder and president of the National Black Farmers Association. President Barack Obama issued a statement applauding the Senate's decision and urging the House to follow-up on its efforts earlier this year, so he can sign the settlements into law. Officials are still working to resolve similar discrimination lawsuits filed against the U.S. Department of Agriculture by women and Latino farmers, according to Obama. ""While these legislative achievements reflect important progress, they also serve to remind us that much work remains to be done,"" Obama said. In another statement, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack called the settlements ""a major milestone in the U.S. Department of Agriculture's efforts to turn the page on a sad chapter."" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, also said the vote gives ""long-suffering Americans ... the closure that they deserve."" ""The agreement that we reached shows what can happen when Democrats and Republicans come together to do the right thing,"" he said. The measure was approved by unanimous consent. The Senate also cleared -- in the same piece of legislation -- $3.4 billion to fund a separate settlement reached with the Department of Interior for mishandling of a trust fund managed for Native Americans. The bill also includes settlements for four water-right lawsuits filed by Native American tribes. In July, the House approved a war supplemental bill that included money to pay for the settlements.  At the time, however, the Senate failed to approve the measure. Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Oklahoma, dropped an objection to the package this week after Senate leaders agreed not to finance it through additional deficit spending. Prominent members of both parties have voiced support for paying out the settlements. The measure will now have to be approved by the lame duck House before moving to Obama's desk to be signed into law.

"(CNN) -- He has entered the record books with his 600th round of golf this year, but retiree Richard Lewis is not finished yet. The 64-year-old American has walked some 2,500 miles and hit over 50,000 shots after reaching the milestone at the Four Seasons Resort in the Las Colinas region of Dallas, Texas on Sunday. The DeSoto, Dallas native has played as many as 54 holes in a day in 2010, but made do with a regulation 18 to extend his world record for the number of rounds played in a year by an amateur. ""I thought 400 was tough and 500 was a stretch, but 600 was what I had in mind all the time,"" he told the PGA Tour website after shooting an 86. ""It's a huge relief and sense of accomplishment. I can't remember the last time I did only 18 in a day."" Lewis' feat has been recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records, which lists him as the world's ""most avid golfer."" He had already beaten the previous record of 586 rounds in a year set in Ohio in 1998, and hopes to reach 611 by New Years' Eve. Lewis next wants to be recognized for playing 11,000 holes in a year, walking the same course 611 times in a year and playing 285 days consecutively to close out 2010. Four Seasons' members paid for the privilege of accompanying Lewis for his landmark round, with the $8,800 raised benefiting the First Tee of Dallas program -- a charity that helps young people through golf-related initiatives. Among them was the club's men's association president Frank Broyles, who thought it especially fitting that Lewis broke the record at the home of the Byron Nelson Championship, an annual tournament on the PGA Tour. ""To think this could have happened at any course in America and it happened here is just incredible,"" he said. ""Byron (Nelson) always said, 'Be good to the game and give back' and that's what we've done here today."" Lewis, the former president of an insurance company, set his sights on the record after retiring in 2009, and claims to have lost 35 pounds and dropped four trouser sizes in making it a reality. His girlfriend Debbie Shaw has played some of 600 rounds alongside him, and spent others riding a cart as a spectator and acting as a photographer to document his achievement.

"London, England (CNN) -- When Nadya Suleman gave birth to octuplets in January 2009 the news was greeted with amazement around the world. But astonishment soon gave way to criticism directed at her -- it was revealed that she was already a mother to six children -- and over the ethics of fertility treatment. So far she has weathered the storm and soon her eight babies will be celebrating their first birthday. But how on earth does she cope? ""The children sleep all night,"" she told CNN's Max Foster. ""They sleep maybe from 7.30pm to 5am, but there are not enough hours in the day."" Caring for octuplets -- six boys and two girls -- poses a unique economic challenge for the 34-year-old mother of 14 who has also been criticized for being jobless. ""It's a challenge. It's a double-edged sword. I'm damned if I work and I'm damned if I don't. I can't work a nine-to-five job because that's not going to be enough income to support the kids. I'm trying to secure what I can."" Suleman says trying to manage the domestic budget is like ""a revolving door of expenses. Every dollar that comes in goes on the kids."" ""Octomom"" -- as she has been dubbed by the media -- does have some help with the child-rearing from three helpers, one of which is dedicated to looking after her child who has autism. Inevitably, it is impossible for her to give each child the attention they deserve. ""It would be impossible for a couple. You just try and do the best you can. You try and have special time with each child -- putting them to bed, telling them a story, asking them about their day -- as long as they get alone time and it's quality. I'd love to give them quantity but that's virtually impossible."" Despite her experience with fertility treatment Suleman is reluctant for across the board limits on the number of embryos that can be implanted during IVF treatment. ""Every case is subjective, every woman responds differently,"" Suleman said. ""Given my past reproductive history my doctor didn't make any kind of mistake, he was guided by what was successful in the past. So only a certain amount of embryos were transferred -- the same amount when I had my twins. The last thing anyone imagined was more than one or two growing."" Although the burden of raising 14 children is obvious, Suleman is reluctant to jump into a relationship. She isn't in a rush to find a male role model for her children. ""I believe I do not have to put myself out there. I do not have to date. I feel the missing piece of the puzzle will be placed naturally when the time is right. I don't see the point in going out and wasting precious time and energy that I need for my kids."" Suleman is currently documenting the experiences of the past year in a book and despite the constant sniping from the media she still manages to reflect positively on the past 12 months. I've definitely grown more in the past eleven months than I have in the past 34 years. I personally believe everything happens for a reason and I've learnt how strong I am. It's a choice who you let into your life and who you are going to allow to affect you psychologically or emotionally. I've learned how to maintain boundaries and how to grow as a result of some extraordinarily challenging situations.""","Nadya Suleman, mother of ocpuplets speaks to CNN about her amazing year .

"(CNN) -- Frustrated Australia captain Ricky Ponting was fined for arguing with the umpires as England took complete control of the fourth Ashes Test in Melbourne on Monday thanks to Jonathan Trott's century. Ponting, who faces the prospect of becoming the first skipper from his country to loses three Ashes series since 1890, was furious after having a video replay decision turned down. The 36-year-old called for a referral after England batsman Kevin Pietersen was ruled not to have edged a delivery from Ryan Harris to wicketkeeper Brad Haddin. Video replays and sound technology showed no contact with the bat, but Ponting nonetheless remonstrated with umpires Aleem Dar and Tony Hill. Will Australia's one-day cricket reign end in 2011? Match referee Ranjan Madugalle subsequently fined Ponting 40% of his match fee. He could have been banned for the final Test in Sydney, but received a lesser punishment. ""Ricky's actions as captain of his country were unacceptable,"" the Sri Lanka said in a statement. ""A captain is expected to set the example and not get involved in a prolonged discussion with the on-field umpires and question their decision. ""While pleading guilty to the charge, Ricky understood that the discussion went far too long. He apologized for his action and stated that he has nothing but respect for the umpires and his on-field actions were not intended to show disrespect to Aleem Dar or Tony Hill."" It was the latest setback for Ponting, who went into the match nursing a fractured finger which has hampered his fielding, and he failed again with the bat as Australia made just 98 in Sunday's opening sessions. England in total command as Australia collapse at MCG . England resumed on 157-0 but soon lost Alastair Cook as the left-hander added just two runs to his overnight 80 to become the first of Peter Siddle's three victims. Siddle then dismissed captain Andrew Strauss for 69, but Trott and Pietersen added 92 for the third wicket. Pietersen was on 49 when the controversy struck, but although he survived to make his 21st half-century in 70 Tests the South Africa-born player did not last much longer as Siddle trapped him leg before wicket for 51 with a low delivery. Trott also had some luck before reaching 50, having apparently been run out from Ponting's throw before video replays gave him the benefit of the doubt. Australia level Ashes series with emphatic Perth win . Mitchell Johnson continued his revival of form which saw Australia level the series at 1-1 with victory in the last match in Perth, as the left-arm paceman had Paul Collingwood (8) and the in-form Ian Bell (1) caught hooking at short deliveries. Johnson thought he had Matt Prior out as well when the batsman was on just six, but a replay called for by Dar showed that he had bowled a no-ball. Prior then helped Trott add an unbroken 158 for the sixth wicket as England reached stumps on 444-5 for a lead of 346 runs with three days still to play. Trott scored his third century in five Ashes appearances and his fifth in 17 Tests overall as he ended the day on 141, having hit 12 fours off 278 balls faced. Prior, like Trott also born in South Africa, took toll on the Australian bowlers as he smashed 10 fours in his 75 from just 105 deliveries. Victory in Melbourne will mean that England retain the Ashes urn no matter the result in the Sydney finale starting on January 3.","England lead Australia by 346 runs with five first-innings wickets remaining .

"(CNN) -- Justin Lemire-Elmore would be the first to admit he's a bit of a revolutionary. This is a guy whose teen years included teaching himself how to build bombs in his parents' basement. At 14, while trying to be the first on his block to make explosives, Lemire-Elmore accidentally burned the skin off half his face. ""My sister took me to the clinic and I was all bandaged up for two weeks,"" he says on the phone from his business in Vancouver, British Columbia. ""My parents just figured I would take that lesson to heart and be more careful."" Now a 29-year-old engineer and business owner, Lemire-Elmore has found himself among the vanguard of a thriving online counterculture. This group rejects traditional bicycles, and chooses to make their own bikes propelled by battery-powered electric motors. Many of them believe they're helping to create future communities that will have fewer polluting vehicles and less traffic congestion. See e-bikes ""hacked"" by CNN iReporters . The e-bike revolution is starting on the Web as people ""hack together their own electric-assist bike projects,"" Lemire-Elmore said. Within the next 20 years, he believes, e-bikes will change the way most city-dwellers commute to work. At online group sites like Yahoo's power-assist and e-motor assist or elsewhere at endless-sphere.com, parents, students, teens, tinkerers and other e-bike enthusiasts share tips on how to motorize their bicycles to achieve speeds up to 35 mph without pedaling. Some of them, for example, ask how to soup up their recumbent bikes so they can tow their children in makeshift trailers. The underground e-bike movement is fueled by people from all backgrounds, with many different motivations behind their e-bike interests. Some of them, says Lemire-Elmore, have rejected cars after losing loved ones in deadly accidents. Others are driven by environmental concerns and have strong anti-oil sentiments. ""But for me, it comes from a sense of embarrassment in this society -- this is really the best we can do?"" Lemire-Elmore rails against the status quo of cities jammed with thousands of people in cars, trapped in traffic gridlock, wasting untold amounts of energy. In China, an estimated 22 million e-bikes will be sold in 2010 alone, according to Electric Bikes Worldwide Reports. Europe will see a million e-bikes sold. Compare that to 300,000 e-bikes in the U.S. ""Gas at $10 per gallon would really spark the industry in the United States,"" says EBWR publisher Frank Jamerson. ""Gas prices are closer to that number in China and in Europe and that's where all the sales momentum is in the e-bike area."" ""Chinese citizens embraced electric bikes and changed China's plan to focus their infrastructure on autos,"" says Lemire-Elmore, whose buoyant demeanor belies his tenacity about asserting electric bikers' rights. ""A large percentage of the people doing home-built conversions are running things that blatantly violate regulations for electric bicycles,"" says Lemire-Elmore. ""I'm fine with that, in the sense that I'm somebody who believes very strongly in doing what you think is right rather than what is the law."" Like Lemire-Elmore, e-bikers in the relatively bike-friendly state of Colorado are butting heads with tradition. In city halls, e-bikers are lobbying to gain access to bike lanes, bike paths and bike parks -- where motorized vehicles including e-bikes are often banned. Residents acknowledge occasional roadway confrontations between e-bikers and non-motorized bicyclists -- ranging from friendly teasing to outright animosity. Dean Keyek-Franssen, co-owner of Pete's eBikes stores in the Colorado towns of Boulder, Aspen and Frisco, describes bicyclists with skintight bike clothing as ""Lycra-bound."" ""You will have a Lycra-bound person passing an electric bike rider, telling her to get out of the bike lane,"" says Keyek-Franssen. ""And it's just this elitist biking community that we have here in Boulder -- and that's great, it's a biking community -- as is Portland and Minneapolis -- and it comes with the territory."" Turned off by showroom price tags on factory-made bikes -- some as high as $3,500 -- many e-bike hackers are turned on by building their own rigs that are often faster and more powerful. Gallery: e-trikes, motor kits and enclosed vehicles . Hackers are actually beneficial to the e-bike industry, says Keyek-Franssen, because they're helping to get more electric bikes into the marketplace. ""At the same time it's a problem because typically those bikes aren't engineered well where some component may fail,"" he says. ""And that can be dangerous if they're going too fast on a bike path."" About a mile down Pearl Street from Keyek-Franssen's shop is University Bicycles, Boulder's oldest and largest bike store. General manager Lester Binegar -- whose job used to be selling e-bikes -- is no fan. ""The technology has come a long way and I do think they're better than using a car -- but I just think it's lazy Americanism,"" Binegar says. ""It's like we're still trying to avoid doing some work that isn't that hard -- work that will make you feel great."" Lemire-Elmore believes the culture at traditional bike stores can be closed-minded -- which has contributed to a widespread attitude against e-bikes. ""People with electric bicycles are often shunned whenever they go to bike stores for parts or for repairs."" Experts who design community bike plans for roadway bike traffic and off-road bike paths generally don't factor in e-bikes, says Jennifer Toole of Toole Design Group.""It's kind of a wait-and-see approach to electric bikes,"" says Toole, whose firm designed Seattle's Bicycle Master Plan and has projects in 15 states. ""If electric bikes become really popular, cities will start dealing with them."" If that happens, she says, the result will likely be more bike lanes and a re-evaluation of whether bikes should be allowed on sidewalks. Lemire-Elmore demonstrated the viability of e-bikes in 2008, when he rode one 4,350 miles coast to coast from Vancouver to Halifax, Nova Scotia, in just two months. During the entire journey, his super-efficient battery-powered motor used a scant $8.57 worth of electricity. For other revolutionaries who think two electric-assisted wheels are too many, Lemire-Elmore has developed an electric unicycle.  See CNN iReport video of his electric unicycle. Unicycles are harder to ride than bikes, but more portable and easier to carry onto trains or buses. By 2011, Lemire-Elmore is hoping to produce an electric-assist conversion kit for unicycles. What's next? How about an electric skateboard? ""It's illegal to ride a skateboard to work in almost every city in North America,"" Lemire-Elmore says. ""And yet somebody riding a skateboard to work is using a fraction of the resources of somebody driving an SUV, which is fully sanctioned by the law."" ""I think there would be a strong underground culture of people that would totally embrace it regardless of whether it's legal. I want to be one of the people who champions that.""

"(CNN) -- This holiday season, many people received e-book readers as gifts -- but what about the books? It has been surprisingly difficult to give someone an e-book as a gift. You could buy them a gift card for the e-book service of their choice, and maybe suggest which book to purchase, but you couldn't actually purchase it for them. In November, Amazon changed that. You can now buy a Kindle book as a gift. Recently I tested this by purchasing a holiday gift for a friend. She reported that obtaining my gift was easy -- she got an e-mail notification of the gift, clicked a link in the e-mail, clicked a link on the Amazon site to accept the gift, and then was able to download the book to her Kindle. This process also works for people who use the free Kindle smartphone or tablet apps, rather than the Kindle device. However if someone you know uses one of the other popular brand-name e-readers, they're probably out of luck for direct e-book gifting. So far, you cannot give a Barnes & Noble NookBook directly as a gift. Nor can you give an iBook, or a Sony e-book. You can, of course, buy or obtain e-books in other formats -- there are many: plain text, HTML, PDF, MobiPocket, ePub, and more. But you'd need to check first whether your recipient would be able to use these book formats, and that would probably ruin the surprise. As a Kindle user who has many friends who also use the Kindle, I'm glad that Amazon finally began offering this option. Obviously it can be done, and the experiences can be user-friendly for the buyer and recipient. But I'm surprised Apple, Barnes & Noble and Sony haven't followed Amazon's lead on this. They're just leaving money on the table -- and in the current tight economy, what retailer can afford to do that? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Amy Gahran.","Amazon changed its policy to allow customers to give e-books as gifts .

"(CNN) -- A right-wing paramilitary leader in Colombia was killed in a police operation on Christmas Day, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos confirmed Wednesday. Pedro Guerrero, also known as ""The Knife,"" was a ruthless killer and a major drug trafficker, the president said. On December 24, national police forces dropped in from helicopters to raid a building where Guerrero was thought to be. The operation carried on into the early morning, the president said, and Guerrero -- the leader of the Popular Revolutionary Anti-terrorist Army of Colombia, or ERPAC by its Spanish initials -- managed to escape the building. However, Santos said, police were ready with a perimeter around the area. His body was found shortly afterwards. Two police were also killed in the confrontation. ERPAC is known for its large cocaine production and distribution activities. The group emerged from the fighting between leftist rebels and right-wing paramilitary groups. ""This individual caused much damage to our country. That's why this strike is so important,"" Santos said, calling Guerrero ""the killer of killers."" He is believed to be responsible for more than 2,000 killings in southern Colombia and earned the nickname ""The Knife"" for his alleged penchant for slashing throats. On Guerrero's body, they found a handgun plated with gold and diamonds, and a knife was in his hand, Santos said. A reward will be paid to ""several"" people who helped authorities find Guerrero, the president said. ""This is a warning to all the other criminals: You will fall,"" Santos said. The operation is evidence that the government goes after not only the left-wing rebels but also the paramilitary criminals, the president said.","President Santos praises the national police operation .

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- Iraqi security forces stormed a Catholic church Sunday where gunmen suspected of having ties to al Qaeda were holding worshippers hostage, ending an hours-long standoff, police officials said Sunday. Thirty-seven people were killed in the operation, including hostages, kidnappers and security workers, they said. At least seven of the victims were hostages, police officials said, while another 57 were wounded. Eight suspects were arrested. ""All the marks point out that this incident carries the fingerprints of al Qaeda,"" Iraqi Defense Minister Abdul Qader Obeidi said on state television Sunday. He said that most of the hostages were killed or wounded when the kidnappers set off explosives inside the church. The Islamic State of Iraq later claimed responsibility for the attack through a statement posted on a radical Islamic website. The umbrella group includes a number of Sunni extremist organizations and has ties to al Qaeda in Iraq. An American military spokesman said that as many as 10 hostages died and that between 20 and 30 people were injured in the operation. Seven Iraqi security workers and between five and seven suspected insurgents were also killed, said Lt. Col. Eric Bloom. Survivors of the ordeal said they were about to begin Sunday night services when the gunmen entered the church, according to Martin Chulov, a journalist for the U.K.-based Guardian newspaper who was on the scene. About 50 people were inside the church at the time, and a priest ushered them into a back room, Chulov reported survivors said. The U.S. military spokesman said that as many as 120 people were taken hostage. At one point, one of the gunmen entered the room and threw an unidentified explosive device inside, causing casualties, Chulov said. The gunmen seized the hostages after attacking the Baghdad Stock Market in the central part of the Iraqi capital, earlier Sunday, police said. Four armed men entered the nearby Sayidat al-Nejat church after clashing with Iraqi security forces trying to repel the stock market attack. The gunmen were demanding that the Iraqi government release a number of detainees and prisoners inside Iraqi prisons, saying the Christian hostages would be freed in return, according to the police officials. Iraq's defense minister later said on state television that the kidnappers had demanded the release of a number of prisoners in both Iraq and Egypt. Iraqi security forces sealed off the area surrounding the church, the officials said, and buildings were evacuated of civilians as a precautionary measure. At least 13 hostages, including two children, managed to escape ahead of the security operation, police said. The Iraqi authorities ordered the attackers to release the hostages and to turn themselves in, warning that they would storm the church if they do not comply. A few hours passed quietly as military units took up positions outside the church, including several American units, said Chulov. ""Then all hell broke loose,"" he said. A firefight erupted and Chulov said he heard three to four large explosions. Later, he saw about 20 ambulances race away from the scene. The American military spokesman minimized the role U.S. troops played in the operation. ""The U.S. only provided UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) support with video imagery. As always we have advisers with the ISF (Iraqi security forces) command teams,"" said Bloom. While the U.S. combat mission in Iraq officially ended earlier this year, some 50,000 American troops are expected to remain in the country until the end of 2011 to train, assist and advise Iraqi troops. Two guards were killed and four others were wounded in the earlier attack on the stock market, according to the police officials. The attackers also remotely detonated two car bombs outside the stock exchange, they said.

"(CNN) -- Andy Roddick has told the official ATP Tour website that he is fit and raring to go as he prepares to defend his Brisbane International title next week. The world number eight feels he was never in tip-top shape throughout 2010, but he now believes he is over the illness and injury problems that prevented him from performing to the best of his ability. ""For me, it's just a matter of getting healthy. I battled mononucleosis for a big part of 2010 and from there I just felt like I was playing catch-up,"" the American told atpworldtour.com. ""I think it's the first time I've felt right since last May so when you are fit it takes a lot of the mental pressure off. You feel like you can play anyway you want so I feel fresh, enthused and ready to go."" Roddick, who beat Czech Radek Stepanek in last year's final, added: ""I came in last year and hadn't been playing much so this was a really good springboard into the year for me. ""I like playing in this event and my wife enjoys coming here too, so let us not pretend I make any decisions!"" Roddick's words were echoed by his physical trainer Lance Hooten, who told the ATP Tour website: ""I haven't seen him this motivated for some time. ""Andy's always been a grinder, a hard worker, but you have to put reins on him all the time because he's always going to work too hard, too long and too much,"" Hooten added.

"(CNN) -- As rescue efforts continue Tuesday, Colombia's president will visit the mountainside neighborhood where a massive landslide buried dozens of homes. By Monday night, search crews had uncovered 23 dead bodies there, the Red Cross said, and more than 120 people could still be trapped underground. ""We are still hoping to find people alive,"" Red Cross National Deputy Director Jorge Ivan Nova said Monday. But he said survival becomes less likely as time passes. Rescuers had pulled at least seven injured people from the rubble after Sunday's landslide in Bello, Colombia, which buried between 30 and 50 homes, Nova said. Officials believe the neighborhood was particularly packed Sunday afternoon -- a time when families commonly get together for meals, he said. ""I hope they can be rescued. You could hear screams below the homes. I ask that they not stop the search. Thank God I could save my son and my husband also is alive. But I lost many loved ones,"" resident Maria Garcia told CNN affiliate Caracol TV. More than 700 people were working in shifts on search teams at the site Monday, Caracol reported. Amid the chaos of the rescue effort, a young boy tugged firefighter Carlos Garcia's belt. ""He asked me, 'firefighter, where are we going to sleep tonight?' And what most impacted me was seeing his little face. I also have a 6-year-old boy,"" Garcia told Caracol. About 150 people from the neighborhood were in nearby shelters, Caracol reported, and government officials said they were evacuating other neighborhoods in the area. ""The zone, geologically, is very unstable,"" Diego Munoz, Bello's government secretary, told Caracol. At least 194 people have been killed and 248 injured after torrential rains throughout Colombia that have affected nearly 1.6 million people, according to the country's interior ministry. The downpours have caused landslides and overflowing rivers, destroying at least 2,040 houses and damaging nearly 270,000 more nationwide, the ministry said. Colombia is considering declaring a state of emergency to devote more resources to response and rescue efforts, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said Sunday, describing the rains and flooding as ""a tragedy that has no precedent in the history of our country."" The president said he plans to travel Tuesday to Bello -- a suburb of Medellin, Colombia. ""My heart is with the victims of this terrible tragedy... In a few hours we will go directly to Medellin to be with the victims' families and tell them, 'Whatever the government can do to mitigate this pain and suffering, we will be there,'"" Santos said in a statement Monday.

"(CNN) -- Search crews found a second body in the ruins of a furniture store destroyed by a gas explosion in Wayne, Michigan, the city's fire chief said early Thursday. The body of a 54-year-old woman, a store employee, was pulled from the rubble of Franks Furniture around 10:45 p.m. Wednesday, according to Wayne Fire Chief Mel Moore. Earlier in the day, the body of a 64-year-old man was also recovered. He was identified only as a male employee of the store, who lived in Westland, Michigan. The store's owner, Paul Franks, 64, was pulled from the wreckage shortly after the explosion, which occurred at about 9 a.m., City Manager John Zech said. He was in serious but stable condition at the University of Michigan Hospital's burn unit. Search and rescue crews, aided by heavy equipment, continued to remove huge amounts of rubble from the scene of the blast, which damaged several buildings in addition to the furniture store. Moore said the process was made more difficult by the removal of ""thousands of pounds of concrete"" from the store's roof trusses. As many as 300 people were evacuated after the explosion and a second reported leak in a neighborhood adjoining the furniture store in the suburban Detroit city. As of Wednesday night, residents of all but nine homes were able to return, and were being offered lodging elsewhere for the night, said Debra Dodd, a spokeswoman for the gas utility, Consumers Energy. Mayor Abdul ""Al"" Haidous described Frank's Furniture as one of the ""jewels"" of the city, and said Franks has been a leader in civic life. ""He has served this city with a great deal of integrity,"" the mayor said . Before the explosion, a Consumers Energy gas worker was two blocks away investigating the reported gas leak, Dodd said. ""We don't know at this time what caused the incident this morning,"" Dodd said Wednesday night, but added that the utility will work with the state Public Service Commission in investigating.","Second body is found in the rubble of a furniture store, official says .

"(CNN) -- Substitute Didier Drogba missed a last minute penalty as Premier League champions Chelsea drew 1-1 at rivals Tottenham in a thrilling London derby on Sunday. Drogba, who had earlier scored the equalizing goal for the visitors, saw his spot-kick superbly saved by Heurelho Gomes -- after the Brazilian goalkeeper had clattered into compatriot Ramires in the penalty area. Chelsea had come into the match in poor form, with a run of just one win in six league games seeing them slide down the table from top to fourth position. And another defeat looked on the cards for Carlo Ancelotti's side when Roman Pavlyuchenko gave Tottenham a 15th-minute lead. Strike partner Jermain Defoe looked just offside when collecting a long ball, but play was allowed to continue and his ball into the box was well controlled in one touch by Russian Pavlyuchenko, before his second touch found the bottom corner of Peter Cech's net. Drogba, who was relegated to the bench by manager Ancelotti after a run of just two goals in 11 games in all competitions, was brought on in the second half and he made his mark in the 70th minute when his snapshot proved much too hot for Gomes to handle. Both sides had chances to claim all three points in an end-to-end contest but Drogba's last-gasp miss ensured the points were eventually shared. The result means Arsenal stay top of the table ahead of their crunch visit to Manchester United on Monday. The Gunners lead Manchester City on goal difference, with Manchester United and Chelsea just a point behind in third and fourth -- in the closest title race in recent seasons. Tottenham remain in fifth place after the draw, a further four points behind, with Bolton in sixth after defeating Blackburn 2-1 on Sunday despite the second-half dismissal of midfielder Mark Davies. The other match on Sunday saw second-from-bottom Wolverhampton improve their chances of avoiding the drop, as Stephen Hunt's goal gave them a 1-0 victory over West Midlands rivals Birmingham.","Didier Drogba misses a late penalty as Chelsea draw 1-1 at Tottenham on Sunday .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- A letter from about 30 prominent rabbis' wives was causing a stir in Israel Wednesday because it urges Israeli girls not to date Arabs. The open letter comes three weeks after the uproar caused by another letter, which was written by 50 state-appointed rabbis and told Jews not to rent or sell property to non-Jews. The latest missive, which was published by some websites and news outlets, says Arab men act polite around Jewish girls and ""act as if they really care about you,"" but it says that's a ruse. The men, it says, even change their Arab names to Hebrew forms like Yossi and Ami in order to get close to the girls. ""This behavior is temporary,"" the letter says. ""As soon as you are in their hands, in their villages under their control, everything becomes different. You can ask dozens of girls who have been there. They will tell you it is all an act. ""As soon as you arrive at the village, your life will never be the same. The attention will be replaced with curses, beatings, and humiliations. Even if you want to leave the village it will be much harder. They won't let you, they will chase you, they won't let you come back."" It urges Jewish girls not to go out with non-Jews or work in places that employ non-Jews. ""Your grandmothers never dreamt that their descendants would do something that will take the next generations of her family out of the Jewish people,"" it says. The letter was initiated by the head of Lehava, an extreme right-wing group that says it aims to prevent the ""assimilation of the Jewish people"" and works at ""saving Jewish girls from Arab villages."" ""It's known that girls who go out with Arabs are beaten, these girls are in danger. ... There is a violent social trend and everyone ignores it,"" said the head of the group, Anat Gopstein, in a radio interview Wednesday morning. The head of Israel's Reform movement, Rabbi Gilad Kariv, harshly condemned the letter and said, ""Israeli society is falling into a deep, dark pit of racism and xenophobia,"" according to spokeswoman Yuli Goren. More than 30 female rabbis from the Reform movement published a counter-letter harshly condemning the one released Wednesday, Goren said. Kariv also called on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Justice Minister Yaacov Neeman to speak out against it. Among the rabbis' wives who signed the letter is Nitzchia Yossef, the daughter-in-law of Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, the spiritual leader of the ultra-orthodox Shas political party. Esther Lior, the wife of extreme right-wing Rabbi Dov Lior, was another signatory. Rabbi Yosef was one of the authors of the letter written earlier this month that urged Jews not to sell or rent property to non-Jews. It prompted widespread condemnation from politicians, human rights groups and leading rabbis in both Israel and the United States. The letter, which was distributed to synagogues and published in some religious newspapers, had warned that those who defied the religious ruling should be ostracized. It said if one apartment is taken by a non-Jew, it devalues all the neighbors' apartments. More than 800 rabbis from around the world signed a petition against the letter, saying ""statements like these do great damage to our efforts to encourage people to love and support Israel."" The petition said ""the attempt to root discriminatory policies based on religion or ethnicity in Torah is a painful distortion of our tradition. Am Yisrael (the Jewish people) knows the sting of discrimination, and we still bear the scars of hatred. When those who represent the official rabbinic leadership of the state of Israel express such positions, we are distressed by this ... desecration of God's name."" Nearly 1.5 million Arab residents live inside Israel, making up 23% of the population. A poll published Tuesday by the Hebrew University in Jerusalem showed that 48% of Israelis oppose the call to avoid renting or selling property to Arabs.","The letter is written by prominent rabbis' wives .

"London, England (CNN) -- Bomb attacks by dissidents in Northern Ireland nearly quadrupled over the past six months from the period before, a report from the Independent Monitoring Commission said Thursday. Dissident republicans have steadily increased the number of improvised explosive devices they have deployed and detonated over the past two and a half years, the commission said. Since May, the number of devices deployed was roughly double that of the previous six months -- and the number detonated went up nearly fourfold, it said. The findings by the commission, set up nearly seven years ago by the British and Irish governments, are in the latest and last of its biannual reports on the paramilitary and security situation in Northern Ireland. While the number of bombings has gone up, there have been no deaths from bomb attacks and no one has suffered life-threatening injuries. Still, the commission said, ""the high level of dissident activity would undoubtedly have led to many more deaths, injuries, and destruction had it not been for the operations of the law enforcement and security agencies north and south (in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland) and their ever closer cross-border co-operation."" It said that in both Northern Ireland and the Republic, about three times the number of dissidents have been charged with terrorist offenses in all of 2010 than in 2009, and the number of arrests has nearly doubled. Dissident republicans are those who refused to accept the 1998 Good Friday peace settlement and power-sharing deal negotiated and signed by mainstream republican leaders such as Sinn Fein's Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness. Groups like the Real IRA and Continuity IRA broke away from the Irish Republican Army, also called the IRA, which fought for decades against British rule in Northern Ireland. The IRA agreed to a process of decommissioning under the Good Friday deal, something the dissident republicans do not accept. The report also said the two factions of the Real IRA have been the the most active and dangerous of all such groups, conducting 18 attacks on members of the security forces and those associated with them. Each faction has its own structure and ""army council,"" the report said. ""Together, the two were responsible for a very major campaign of violence directed particularly at members of the security forces,"" the report said. ""It was the most serious paramilitary threat over the six months under review."" The attacks included an improvised mortar, pipe bombs, and shots fired at army and police targets. In August, a device in a hijacked taxi exploded outside a police station in Derry, causing substantial damage to property. ""During the six months under review, the two factions of (the Real IRA) remained a very dangerous and potentially lethal terrorist threat,"" the report said. ""We are convinced that they would have taken the lives of members of the security forces if they had been able to do so in several of the attacks."" Amid the rise in the number of bomb attacks, the number of casualties from shootings and assaults over the six-month period was ""considerably lower"" than in the recent past, something the Independent Monitoring Commission attributed to a reduction in the amount of violence inflicted on people for anti-social behavior like dealing drugs. ""At a time when attention is rightly directed to the dissident threat, this trend should also be borne in mind,"" the report said. CNN's Melissa Gray in London, England, and Journalist Peter Taggart in Belfast, Northern Ireland, contributed to this report.","The number of detonated bombs went up fourfold in the past six months .

"Paris, France (CNN) -- Three French hostages kidnapped in Nigeria have been released, the French government said Wednesday. French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner announced their release ""with great joy and deep relief,"" saying the Nigerian authorities had told him the news. The three French nationals were taken hostage in Nigeria September 22 while on a boat belonging to the oil services company Bourbon. They all appear to be in good health ""despite difficult conditions while in captivity,"" Bourbon said Wednesday. They are undergoing medical and psychological tests under the company's care in Nigeria before returning to France, the company said. Kouchner expressed his ""gratitude to the Nigerian authorities for the constant mobilization that led to the release of these three hostages."" They were captured in an attack on their ship, the Bourbon Alexandre, Bourbon said at the time. It's not clear who captured them, but rebels said the following day that they had located them. ""The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta can confirm that it has located the three abducted French nationals and another individual abducted in a separate incident on the same night,"" the group said in a statement September 23. ""We are in negotiations with the abductors towards effecting a transfer of the men to the custody of MEND."" The statement by the group's spokesman Jomo Gbono did not give details on who the kidnappers were. MEND did not issue a statement Wednesday when the French nationals were released. It is not clear who the fourth hostage was. Sixteen crew members were on the Alexandre when it was attacked by speedboats, Bourbon said. Thirteen remained on the ship and were unhurt, the company said. The company provides ship and underwater services to oil and gas clients worldwide. MEND, the key militant group in the oil-rich Niger Delta, is an umbrella organization of several rebel groups. It has been battling the government for years over a more even distribution of the country's oil wealth.

"(CNN) -- Temporary calm returned to Rio de Janeiro on Saturday as anxious residents remained locked in their homes, awaiting developments in the week-long conflict that has turned their picturesque city into a de facto war zone. Dozens of armored military vehicles combed the streets of Rio on Saturday, video from CNN's Brazilian affiliate TV Record showed, as authorities prepare for another incursion into some of the city's notoriously dangerous shanty towns, including the Alemao favela complex -- a virtually impenetrable labyrinth of slums in the city's north. Police spokesman Mario Sergio Duarte declared an ultimatum Saturday against drug gangs in the complex, stating that a military attack is imminent. ""We will not retreat in our decision to bring peace to Rio,"" Duarte said. ""We are in our final stages of reaching the traffickers in the Alemao complex."" ""Whoever wants to turn himself in, do it now,"" he said. At least 35 people have died, 174 arrested and 123 detained since violence broke out Sunday as a response by drug gangs to an increased police presence in the crime-ridden slums, known as favelas, police said, according to the official Agencia Brasil. More than 96 vehicles have been burned. Gangs continued to torch buses and exchange fire with police Friday throughout the city's northern neighborhoods as more than 800 federal troops arrived to support Rio's civil authorities who are often outnumbered and outgunned by the powerful criminal groups. Freedom of movement also has been curtailed in the conflict zones as police put up blockades in an effort to prevent fugitive criminal gang members from finding protection in neighboring slums. Residents trapped in the crossfire and unable to go to their jobs have waved white flags outside their homes asking drug gangs to spare them, as criminals spray police with semi-automatic weapon fire and military artillery. On Friday, police detained the wife of Marcinho V.P, a renowned drug lord who allegedly ordered the coordinated attacks from a prison in the state of Parana. According to local reports, the conflict began November 21 when disgruntled drug traffickers decided to launch an attack against Rio residents to protest the government's crackdown on their organizations. TV Record showed two letters allegedly written by drug lords from maximum-security prisons, protesting the government's crackdown on drug trafficking and vowing to avenge the arrest of their members. Ocimar Santos, president of Rocinha.org, the website for Rio's largest favela, said that for people who live in Rio's slums, this is business as usual. ""They are listening to the rumors and laying low,"" Santos said. If the conflict spills over to Rocinha, residents there are ready for violence, he said. But for the first time, Santos said, they will side with the police. ""We now perceive that our population feels more protected and respected by the police with the creation of these ... peace units,"" he said. Another development in the conflict is the direct involvement of the federal government. Brazil's Defense Minister Nelson Jobim said that in addition to the 800 federal troops, other reinforcements in support of local police are being directed to Rio amid fears that the crisis could spill over to neighboring states. ""This is not a time to bypass risks, it is the moment to face them,"" Jobim said Friday. Brazil's President Luiz Inacio da Silva said his government will do all it can to support the government of Rio de Janeiro in its fight against drug gangs. Antonio C. Costa, president of Rio de Paz, a local NGO, drew attention to the civilian victims of the clashes and blamed Rio's state government for creating a so-called ""urban Vietnam"" in the city -- the future site of the 2016 Summer Olympics. ""The world's eyes are on Rio de Janeiro, praying that we find a solution to the security crisis, but also intent on knowing whether we are handling this as civilized people,"" Costa said.","Police spokesman says a military attack on notorious slum is imminent .
""Whoever wants to turn himself in, do it now,"" he says .
Civilians are trapped in the crossfire .
The violence is a response by drug gangs to an increased police presence in slums ."
"(Rolling Stone) -- Merle Haggard is no stranger to the White House: He was a guest of both Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, who -- when he was governor of California -- had granted the singer a full pardon for the felonies and misdemeanors that led to three years at San Quentin Prison. Earlier this month, the 73-year-old singer returned to Washington, this time alongside Paul McCartney, Oprah Winfrey, composer Jerry Herman and dancer/choreographer Bill T. Jones to receive the Kennedy Center Honors, a lifetime achievement for the performing arts. In this interview, Haggard reflects on the three-day whirlwind gala, his life after lung cancer, and future plans to record and tour in a new supergroup with Willie Nelson and Kris Kristofferson. The 100 Greatest Singers of All Time: Merle Haggard . What was the highlight for the whole thing for you?   I probably enjoyed meeting the presidents, especially Bill [Clinton]. Is he a big fan of yours?   Well he said he was, and he never lied to me [laughs]. It was also nice to meet Obama and find him very different from the media makeout. It's really almost criminal what they do with our President. There seems to be no shame or anything. They call him all kinds of names all day long, saying he's doing certain things that he's not. It's just a big old political game that I don't want to be part of. There are people spending their lives putting him down. I'm sure some of it's true and some of it's not. I was very surprised to find the man very humble and he had a nice handshake. His wife was very cordial to the guests and especially me. They made a special effort to make me feel welcome. It was not at all the way the media described him to be. What's the biggest lie out there about Obama?   He's not conceited. He's very humble about being the President of the United States, especially in comparison to some presidents we've had who come across like they don't need anybody's help. I think he knows he's in over his head. Anybody with any sense who takes that job and thinks they can handle it must be an idiot. Did you talk to the President much?   I told him, ""You and I have something in common: our wives are both taller than we are."" And he said ""No! She's got on 3-inch heels! And she is not that tall!"" He was like me. He grabbed that real quick. Merle Haggard Looks Back in New Documentary . Did you spend much time mingling with the other honorees?   We had quite a bit of time. There were three events that I attended. Paul was there the whole time. But ""Ope"" -- we got to call Oprah ""Ope"" -- was completely beside herself. I don't think she'd ever been a recipient of much in her life. She reached over to me, leaned over and said, 'You know, we've come the farthest.' Some people wrote about how they didn't think Oprah should be in there because she didn't write music or isn't an artist.   Some people I think are too critical and don't have not enough intelligence to make that kind of a comment. Who is to say? There's a hundred people, including all of the ex-presidents' wives, that have a say on who is nominated. It's not about who wrote the best song or who the best songwriter was, but who was the best in their field. And television is certainly a modern method of communication that you can't overlook and she's probably the mother figure of that right now. I don't know how anybody can say she wasn't deserving of it. What was it like hanging out with Paul McCartney?   He's Paul McCartney, man. You can't forget that he wrote those songs. That kept going through my mind: I'm an aspiring songwriter and sat beside the guy that wrote ""Yesterday."" I recorded that. Some guys are famous for some songs you don't remember, but that's not the case there. When they started ""Hey Jude,"" with this wonderful orchestra, the building came apart. Everybody in the audience was singing it. It was a chiller. Quite a few people showed up to honor you. Kris Kristofferson sang ""Silver Wings"" Willie and Sheryl Crow sang ""Today I Started Loving You Again,"" Vince Gill and Brad Paisley sang ""Workin' Man's Blues."" Jamey Johnson did ""Ramblin' Fever."" What was it like to sit there and just watch these people play your songs that you wrote over the years?   Well, it's the ultimate. You're hittin' around the right spot, it's great, and probably couldn't be topped. And I enjoyed watching Vince Gill give Brad Paisley a lesson ­-- he took a course on ""Workin' Man Blues."" But Brad is so hot and so good. Did you have a good chance to catch up with old friends Willie and Kris?   We got to eat a little something together. We didn't know what the hell this food was, but we thought it was funny. Last summer you told us you and Willie are planning to record an album of new material together.   I'm glad you brought that up. We talked about doing that together, but with the presence of Kris, we talked about the three of us doing it. I'm sure if we're healthy and live to do it, we'll do it. We thought about the title: the Musketeers. You know, because there's the three of us. We'll come up with some little way of describing ourselves I guess and put it together into a show. You had part of your lung removed in 2008 due to cancer and had to cancel a few shows back in September for health reasons. How are you feeling now?  Well, it took a long time to get over that surgery. It took the best part of two years and I'm just now feeling like I might be able to reach over and pick up a garbage can with the right arm. They removed an upper lobe of my right lung, and they had to go in underneath my arm. It's quite painful and irritating to have that. You know how tender that is underneath your arm. To have that heal up, it takes a couple of good years. I think I'm all right now. I went down and had a checkup just prior to going back for this little gig and I was clear. I didn't have anything, and that's an awful good sign. See the full article at RollingStone.com .

"(CNN) -- The African Union has suspended the Ivory Coast from the organization amid the country's political chaos following a November runoff election, it said in a statement. The group suspended the Ivory Coast ""in all AU activities, until such a time the democratically-elected president effectively assumes state power,"" the statement said. The move came after West African leaders Tuesday called on President Laurent Gbago to acknowledge the results of the runoff and hand over power to his challenger, Alassane Ouattara. Both Gbagbo and Ouattara claimed victory after the November 28 voting. On Tuesday, the 15-member Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) said it was suspending the Ivory Coast from all of its decision-making bodies until further notice. The suspension came following a meeting including the presidents of seven member states. Ivory Coast's Constitutional Council invalidated earlier results from the Independent Electoral Commission that named opposition candidate Ouattara the winner, and Gbagbo was sworn in for a new term on Saturday. The AU said it endorses the ECOWAS decision to recognize the results from the Independent Electoral Commission as certified by the U.N. mission in Ivory Coast. It said it ""strongly urges Mr. Laurent Gbagbo to respect the results of the election and to facilitate, without delay, the transfer of power to the president-elect."" The political chaos has heightened fears that the Ivory Coast would once again plunge into the unrest and bloodshed suffered after a civil war broke out in 2002. The European Union has warned that Ivory Coast could face sanctions if the dispute is not resolved swiftly, and France has urged military and civilian authorities in its former colony to respect the will of the people. The AU, in its statement Thursday, called upon Ivory Coast residents, ""at this delicate stage in the history of their country, to exercise utmost restraint and to refrain from any action that could jeopardize peace and the process for a way out of the crisis."" The organization is concerned about the ""humanitarian consequences,"" and condemns the loss of life and destruction of property that have occurred in some parts of the country, it said. In Washington, State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said earlier the United States is concerned about the ""risk of violence"" if Gbagbo fails to recognize the results. ""There are two paths that he can take: one that leads to continued progress for his country and its people, preservation of the institution of democracy; and one that maintains Cote d'Ivoire's role as a leader in Africa,"" Crowley said, using the French name for the country. ""The other path is one that leads to isolation from the global community and most particularly from the African neighbors of Cote d'Ivoire. We hope that President Gbagbo in the coming days will make the right choice."" Once a prosperous nation and a driving force in West Africa, the Ivory Coast spiraled downward into instability after fighting erupted between the government-held south and discontented Muslim rebels living in the north. Thousands of people died in the conflict. Ouattara, a former economist for the International Monetary Fund who served as prime minister, had been banned from previous races. He enjoys popular support in the rebel-held north, and Gbagbo has accused Ouattara of masterminding the civil war -- an allegation the challenger has denied. CNN's Christian Purefoy contributed to this report.","The nation is suspended until the elected president takes office, AU says .

"(CNN) -- Prosecutors in Ukraine have opened a corruption investigation into former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, she said Wednesday, accusing them of a ""political witch hunt."" Authorities are looking into whether she diverted environmental funds toward pensions, she said. She was questioned at the General Prosecutor's Office, she said in a statement on her website. Tymoshenko was one of the leaders of Ukraine's ""Orange Revolution"" in 2005. She ran for president this year but lost to Viktor Yanukovych, one of her Orange Revolution opponents. The two traded accusations -- and their supporters in parliament traded punches -- in April, when Yanukovych signed a deal allowing Russian military bases to remain in the country through 2042. She's now leader of the opposition. ""The authorities continue to systematically terrorize the opposition without any respect for the law or Constitution,"" she said Wednesday. ""Criminal charges have been filed against me personally for allegedly spending environmental funds on pensions ... for committing a serious crime and paying pensions when the country was in a serious crisis,"" she said after being questioned, according to her website. ""Yanukovych ... will have to take responsibility for each act of repression against the genuine opposition, as well as for what he is doing today to all Ukrainian citizens,"" Tymoshenko added, according to the Russian news agency RIA-Novosti. She was ordered to return for more questioning Monday, the agency said.","The leader of the opposition accuses prosecutors of a political witch hunt .

"Conakry, Guinea (CNN) -- Guinea's Supreme Court has ruled Alpha Conde the winner of a November 7 presidential runoff election, the court's president announced Friday in the country's capital city. The ruling wraps up a two-year transition to civilian rule after a military junta took power in December 2008. Provisional results that had been released by the west African country's electoral commission on November 15 put Conde ahead of his rival, Cellou Dalein Diallo, with 52.5 percent of the vote. The Supreme Court took two weeks deliberating fraud charges from both sides before upholding the provisional results of what has been viewed as Guinea's most democratic and transparent election in its 52-year history. ""Mister Alpha Conde, having obtained 52.52 percent of ballots cast, is elected President of the Republic of Guinea,"" Mamadou Sylla, president of the Supreme Court announced to reporters at the Supreme Court office in Conakry shortly after midnight. Upon announcement, representatives from Conde's party rejoiced and cheered their victory but expressed their desire to repair the damages of a polarizing campaign marred by violence and intimidation. ""We ask all Guineans to lend a hand so that together...we can participate in the moral, physical, institutional and political reconstruction of our country,"" Kiridi Bangoura, Conde's campaign director told reporters. Diallo, who had previously rejected the results--alleging the election was riddled with fraud that prevented his victory--took on a more conciliatory tone after the verdict. ""Since the Supreme Court decision allows for no appeals, we can only accept the verdict given by the highest judiciary institution of the republic,"" Diallo told reporters at his home on Friday. The provisional results were met by riots and violence around the country. The prime minister subsequently declared a national state of emergency to deal with the violence. Analysts are worried about the potential of violence in Guinea spreading to neighboring Sierra Leone, Liberia and Ivory Coast, all of which are recovering from civil wars. Fighting broke out in the eastern Sierra Leone town of Kenema between Peul and Malinke after the Guinea election results were announced. ""Sierra Leone and Guinea are only divided by what you call colonial boundaries between us. Most of the major ethnic tribes here you find in Sierra Leone also,"" Adikalie Foday Sumah, ambassador of Sierra Leone to Guinea told CNN recently, adding that ethnic tensions can easily spread across porous borders. The court decision on the election -- which was deemed ""credible and transparent"" by European Union representatives -- surprised few in Guinea's sprawling seaside capital. The new president--a 72-year old former lecturer at Sorbonne University in Paris--will face immense challenges ranging from creating employment to reforming the notoriously corrupt and abusive army in a country sharply divided along ethnic lines.","The decision ends a contentious post-election period that was marked with violence'

"(CNN) -- In what is being called a ""milestone"" for Iraq's future, the U.N. Security Council voted Wednesday to free the Baghdad government from sanctions that started during the Saddam Hussein era. ""The adoptions of these important resolutions marks the beginning of the end of the sanctions regime and restrictions on Iraq's sovereignty, independence and recovery,"" Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari told the council. ""Our people will rejoice for having turned a chapter on the aggressive, belligerent and defiant behavior of the previous regime toward international law and legitimacy."" One resolution ends the oil-for-food program and another ends sanctions relating to weapons of mass destruction. A third ends the Iraqi Development Fund as of June 30. The move is a major step for Iraq toward regaining full sovereignty and improving its standing in the international community. The country will be able to have free and unrestricted international financial and trade dealings and to handle its own oil revenues. And it will be able to start a civilian nuclear power program if it is interested. U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, who chaired the Security Council meeting Wednesday, praised Iraq's progress toward democracy and meeting its international obligations. Biden issued a statement saying the ""Security Council welcomes the positive developments in Iraq,"" including its forging of democracy, its development, and the performance of security forces. ""Politics has emerged as the dominant means for settling differences and advancing interests,"" Biden said. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called the development a ""milestone."" ""Its people have known tremendous hardship,"" he said. ""They continue to struggle with insecurity and appalling violence. They lack jobs and basic services. But today we recognize how far the country has come in key aspects of its journey to normalize its status in the community of nations."" Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, triggering the Gulf War. In 2003, the United States led an invasion of Iraq, citing Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction activities as one of the reasons. But, none of those weapons were discovered. While Wednesday's vote ends sanctions imposed on Iraq from the days of the Hussein regime, other differences remain between Iraq and Kuwait. Zebari said Iraq is committed to settling those unresolved issues bilaterally with Kuwait and his country is ""committed to fulfill its remaining obligations"" under Chapter 7 of the U.N. sanctions. ""Iraq still has some way to go to resolve all outstanding issues with brotherly, neighborly Kuwait,"" he said. ""There has been positive cooperation and exchange between our two governments to resolve and settle all pending issues between our two countries, emanating from Saddam Hussein's aggression and invasion of Kuwait in 1990."" Unresolved issues include demarcation of the Iraqi-Kuwait border and efforts to locate missing Kuwaitis and third-party nationals, and continuing to pay war reparations.","The sanctions were imposed during the Saddam Hussein era .

"Washington (CNN) -- Coalition troops in Afghanistan have been issued revised guidelines for conducting night raids, an official from NATO's International Security Assistance Force said Friday. The raids are considered effective tools to rout insurgents, but they have angered Afghan civilians and government officials. The new directive is meant to underscore the need to coordinate raids with the Afghan government and inform civilians about the reasons for the operation, the ISAF official said. The guidelines stem from the repeated concerns of President Hamid Karzai. Such raids have been considered major intrusions into Afghan lives. The new directive underscores the ""importance of prior coordination with the Afghan government,"" the source said. ""The Afghan government has long had input into operations, but they have expanded the coordination in recent months through the establishment of a command center located within the Presidential Palace grounds in Kabul,"" the source said. Family and village elders need to know where they can get information about detained people and there must be accurate accounting for items seized in night raids. ""Under the previous night raid directive, Afghans military officials were involved in the coordination and approval of night raids, but Gen. David Petraeus has made clear that his intent is to have night raids conducted with even greater care and preparation throughout the country,"" the source said, referring to the top coalition military official in Afghanistan. The source said it has been policy to have the participation of Afghan troops as the norm. Afghan forces have been the first to enter a compound or residence. ""Whenever possible, Afghan forces conduct the callout with a loudspeaker in either Dari or Pashtu in an attempt to capture targeted individuals without violence. These efforts have been very successful -- the overwhelming majority of these operations (80+ % of the time recently) are conducted with no shots fired,"" the source said. The source said all of the measures have been devised ""to reduce the possibility of unnecessary violence, create more transparency, and minimize the impact on people who are not involved in insurgent activity.""","Such operations have angered Afghans .

"(CNN) -- Pregnant again after two miscarriages, Molly Gray was desperate for answers that could help prevent losing a third baby. When she heard about a small study to test the blood of pregnant women for chemicals, she signed up. The result was shocking: Gray's blood tested high for mercury, a heavy metal that can cause brain damage to a developing fetus. A Senate subcommittee Tuesday will examine how chemicals that Americans are exposed to in daily life might be harming the health of children, including those developing in the womb. Witnesses scheduled to appear at the Senate Subcommittee on Superfund, Toxics and Environmental Health hearing include Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lisa Jackson and CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta. Gupta examined the topic in the CNN special ""Toxic America"" first broadcast in June, which focused on the impact of exposure to chemicals in daily life. The first hour was ""Toxic Towns USA,"" which looked at a once-rural town in Louisiana now surrounded by chemical plants, and the second hour was ""Toxic Childhood,"" which examined chemicals in everyday life and their possible health effects. Gupta: Chemicals around us -- we must know more . The special exposed stories such as Gray's situation, which she called ""scary and disheartening."" ""Somehow my son was being exposed to mercury, and that's a weight to carry because I feel like our job as parents is to protect them, to care for them, to nurture them and to keep them out of harm's way,"" Gray told CNN earlier this year. Toxic chemicals finding their way into the womb . A growing number of studies are finding hundreds of toxic chemicals in the bodies of mothers, and subsequently, in their babies after birth. While there is no science that demonstrates a conclusive cause-and-effect relationship between chemicals children are born with and particular health problems, studies are finding associations between elevated levels of chemicals in a baby's body and their development. Tuesday's hearing, called by Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-New Jersey, will take place at the University of Medicine and Dentistry in Newark, New Jersey. Lautenberg has called for updating the federal regulations to require manufacturers to show chemicals are safe before introducing them on the market. Other planned witnesses include Lisa Huguenin, a New Jersey mother of a child with autism and an immune system disorder; Dr. Steven Marcus, executive and medical director of the New Jersey Poison Information and Education System; and Dr. Frederica Perera, director of the Columbia Center for Children's Environmental Health. Perera's center has been following hundreds of pregnant women over the past 12 years to measure chemicals entering the womb during pregnancy. The women trudge through New York City for 48 hours wearing special backpacks, each with a long tube that is slung over the shoulder. The tube, resting inches below the pregnant mom's mouth, sucks air into a special filter, giving an approximate measurement of the air that she is breathing. The backpack is designed to measure ambient toxics spewed by vehicles and pesticides, along with chemicals from common household products. 5 toxic chemicals: Protect yourself . ""It surprised me when we analyzed the air samples [from the backpacks] and found 100 percent of them had detectable levels of at least one pesticide and the air pollutants we were interested in,"" Perera, who also is a professor at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, told CNN earlier this year. ""Every single one."" So far, the toxics measured in the backpacks match what scientists are finding in the cord blood of the babies once they are born. Small studies by other groups also are finding common household chemicals in babies. ""We've measured hundreds and hundreds of toxic chemicals in the blood of babies that are still in the womb,"" said Ken Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group, a non-profit environmental advocacy organization. ""Flame retardants, the chemicals in consumer products like personal care products, makeup, shampoos. It's a very long list."" The organization's study found an average of 232 chemicals in the cord blood of 10 babies born in late 2009. They are chemicals found in a wide array of common household products, including shampoos and conditioners, cosmetics, plastics, shower curtains, mattresses, and electronics like computers and cell phones. Everyday plastic, toxic fears . Perera and her colleagues are following the children in their study from the uterus, through birth, and up to their first several years of life. They recently published a study in the journal Pediatrics demonstrating an association between the chemicals they found in babies' cord blood and later problems on intelligence tests and development. ""Fifteen percent of children [in our study] have at least one developmental problem,"" Perera said. The amount of chemicals measured in the cord blood of the babies seems to matter. The higher the concentration, the more the IQ among children seems to dip. The study is also being conducted among pregnant women in Poland and China, and finding similar results. Gray still struggles with the idea that mercury from her blood may have been passed to her baby. ""There's plastics, there's mercury, there's pesticides,"" said Gray, who also is a practicing midwife. ""The things that we're cleaning our homes with, the things we're building our houses with. I think the sheer volume of the things we have to worry about is a little overwhelming."" Even when her son, Paxton, now more than a year old, was born healthy, Gray and her husband remained vigilant. They steer clear of any products with potentially toxic chemicals. ""Knowing that he got these chemicals from my blood, it's really scary,"" Gray said, adding: ""Paxton and all of our future generations are carrying around this burden that we don't know what it means yet. It's the huge sea of unknown."" CNN Medical News Producer Stephanie Smith contributed to this story.","CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta will be a witness at Tuesday's hearing .

"(CNN) -- One of the diplomatic cables published by WikiLeaks reveals that North Korean officials suggested the U.S. government make arrangements for rock icon Eric Clapton to perform in Pyongyang as a way of building ""good will"" between the countries. The suggestion was relayed to the U.S. Embassy in Seoul, South Korea, through an intermediary whose name was redacted from the document. ""Arranging an Eric Clapton concert in Pyongyang could also be useful, [the intermediary] said, given Kim Jong-Il's second son's devotion to the rock legend,"" the cable begins. ""As Kim Jong-Il's second son, Kim Jong-chol, is reported to be a great fan, the performance could be an opportunity to build good will."" Representatives for Clapton did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Sunday. But one analyst cautioned Sunday that the 2007 cable's contents could say more about an intermediary's interest in trying to promote himself by arranging a high-profile performance than North Korea's leadership. ""At that point, given the generally positive diplomatic atmosphere, I doubt the U.S. government would have objected. But this may be more the fantasy of a self-promoting intermediary than a reflection of the desire of the Dear Leader and his sons to rock 'n' roll in Pyongyang,"" said Mike Chinoy, author of ""Meltdown: The Inside Story of the North Korean Nuclear Crisis."" However, Chinoy -- formerly CNN's Senior Asia Correspondent -- noted that the cable is not the first time a story has surfaced about the Kim family's admiration for the British rock legend. ""One of the stories about Kim Jong Chol and his brother Kim Jong Un is that one, or both, supposedly went to a Clapton concert somewhere in Europe while they were attending boarding school in Switzerland,"" he said. The cable, titled ""[Redacted] Shares Ideas on DPRK Interaction,"" deals with North Korean relations with South Korea, the United States, and Korean-Americans wishing to meet with their relatives still in the country. It makes no reference to the North Korean nuclear program. The intermediary advocated for greater U.S. government involvement in ""facilitating the reunification of Korean-American families divided by the Korean War."" The cable mentions two groups -- Compatriots United and the Los Angeles-based Pyongtong -- that arrange such reunions but often have difficulties dealing with the North Korean bureaucracy. The document says Compatriots United has arranged ""thousands of reunions,"" but it is under the control of North Korea's Overseas Compatriots Committee. That committee, the cable claims, ""extorts a tremendous amount of money from desperate families to arrange the visits."" According to the cable, the intermediary told U.S. diplomats that ""North Korea would not run such an exploitative system if the United States government were involved in the process. There is a reluctance, he said, for Korean-Americans to pursue family reunions because they do not want to divulge their personal information to the DPRK and they do not want the North Koreans to milk them for money before, during and after the reunion."" ""The [United States government] could at least volunteer to serve as a conduit for correspondence between these families and North Korea to prevent the DPRK from learning the home addresses and bank accounts of participants. The DPRK might be willing to accept this structure because it badly wants a relationship with Washington,"" the cable reads. The intermediary also described the frustrating process for any outsiders to get things done in North Korea. ""It is necessary to get the DPRK's various institutions to cooperate. Each institution seems to have veto power, but none has the power to push anything forward. ... The only organizations that can really deliver are the military, which does not talk to anybody, or the Red Cross.""","NEW: An analyst says another story suggests Kim Jong Il's son is a fan of Clapton .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Two 16-year-old Palestinian boys were killed and three other teens were injured in Gaza on Friday from an unexploded Israeli ordnance, Palestinian medical and security officials said. Hamas security sources say the explosive device was left over from Israel's 22-day Gaza offensive that began two years ago. There was no immediate Israeli response to this incident. The Palestinian sources also reported the wounding of two people in Gaza, one a worker collecting gravel near the Erez Crossing and another a farmer east of Khan Younis. An Israel Defense Forces spokesman said Israeli forces fired shots when suspicious people approached the fence between Gaza and Israel in two separate locations. One incident occurred in northern Gaza and the other took place near Khan Younis. Troops first fired warning shots in the air but the people continued moving. Then, they fired at their legs, the IDF said.","The device was left over from the Gaza offensive .

"(CNN) -- Two South African rugby players were sent home from their national team's tour of Europe on Monday after testing positive for a banned drug. Mahlatse ""Chiliboy"" Ralepelle and Bjorn Basson were provisionally suspended from all rugby after the South African Rugby Union was informed of the results late on Sunday. Winger Basson and forward Ralepelle were found to have used the stimulant methylhexaneamine after being randomly tested following the Springboks' 23-21 win over Ireland on November 6. ""The players have the right to request that their 'B' sample be tested,"" the SARU said on its website. ""The pair returned an adverse analytical finding for methylhexaneamine, a ""non-specified stimulant"" on the prohibited substances list of the World Anti-Doping Agency. It is scheduled to be re-classified as a ""specified stimulant"" from January 1, 2011."" Basson missed Saturday's 34-12 win over Wales with an ankle injury suffered in Dublin and was due to leave the tour anyway. Ralepelle, who became the first black player to captain South Africa in a warm-up match earlier in the tour, came on the field as a substitute in Cardiff after not being used against Ireland. They became the latest in a growing list of athletes to test positive for the stimulant methylhexaneamine, which is used in nasal decongestants but has also been an ingredient in now-illegal recreational drugs. Last year, five Jamaican runners were ruled out of the World Athletics Championships and the World Anti-Doping Agency subsequently added the drug to its 2010 prohibited list. Two Nigerian sprinters tested positive for it at October's Commonwealth Games in India, with Damola Osayemi losing her gold medal in the women's 100 meters. Portuguese cyclists Rui Costa and his brother Mario also tested positive that month, while Australia's Daily Telegraph reported that nine sportspeople from that country had done likewise. South Africa coach Peter de Villiers said his staff were trying to find out what lay behind the positive tests. ""We have to look at what might have caused this and we don't want to put the players at risk. If there is something that we are taking as a squad that might have caused this then we must find that out now,"" he told the website of South African television channel SuperSport. ""When I informed the two players that they had been tested positive they were both extremely shocked and disappointed. The rest of the team were also gutted when they heard. I was informed of this at 2 a.m. this morning, and now we must follow the correct processes as laid down by the International Rugby Board."" SuperSport reported that Springboks team doctor Craig Roberts said both Ralepelle and Basson had been taking medication for illnesses. It also said that young South African rugby player Johan Goosen was recently banned for three months after his urine test showed up methylhexaneamine, while .","Rugby players become the latest in a growing list of athletes to test positive for drug .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- ""Tell someone"": It's the phrase most often modeled as the first step in stopping bullying. Experts on the news, researchers and authors repeatedly suggest that victims or witnesses speak to someone about it -- whether it's a classmate, a teacher, parent or friend -- the moment bullying becomes a concern. But at November's International Bullying Prevention Association (IBPA) conference, I received some pushback when I voiced the ""tell someone"" maxim. A teacher raised her hand and discussed a study that found that kids who do tell someone don't think adults take the right action afterward. And for a moment, I asked myself, ""Then what?"" Bullying has been around as long as schools have; it's far older than Facebook, designer jeans and lunch money. There's not a public school in the country where all the kids are nice in the eighth grade. (In fact, one student who commented on our blog at CNNStudentNews.com wrote that whoever said sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me ""has obviously never been to middle school."") At that age level, we were all insulted or called names; some were shoved into lockers or tripped in the hallway; others weren't welcome at certain lunch tables. Things are different today. Because of technology, bullies are no longer stopped at the front door; they can follow students to their rooms on their cell phones or online. Video games have come a long way since Super Mario Bros., evolving from cartoonish characters to (in one popular case) a simulator of terrorism. Family dynamics are constantly changing. To be fair, I clearly remember fights at my suburban Atlanta high school, but they didn't result from random targeting. We had tears, but they didn't lead to any suicides. Wherever the blame for it lies, today's bullying isn't always a temporary condition to endure. It can be something that, for some kids, doesn't get better and doesn't go away, despite what graduates tell them. This is why it is crucial, according to educators and counselors at the IBPA, that students themselves are involved in finding solutions to bullying. It's their school, after all; they represent the majority. It is the students who can speak to a schoolwide survey, for example, that asks what teachers and administrators have done to make the school better -- and what the students themselves have done to make the school better. It is the students who can suggest ideas for reducing the problem, and even if they're not feasible, they can lead to discussions about solutions that are. So this isn't simply about kids seeing someone get bullied, telling an adult, and then stepping back and waiting for the problem to be fixed overnight. It takes time and student involvement. Kids who witness bullying need to know that they have some power to determine the tide of it: It lies in how they respond. First, bystanders shouldn't support bullies with attention, laughter or anything that could make them proud of what they've done. Bullies aren't usually bullying out of anger; they're trying to get something they want, like approval or social status. And in general, they need witnesses for that. So bystanders who see bullying should respond in such a way that the bully feels isolated afterward -- not more powerful or popular, not encouraged. Taking away the reward for the behavior can take away the inspiration for it. Second, witnesses should support the targeted students. Another takeaway from the IBPA conference: Victims who've had someone defend them -- even if was just a single peer -- are better adjusted than undefended victims of bullying. So whether it's through kindness to the victim, discouragement to the bully or alerting a teacher, if a bystander stands up for a victim, the latter will probably have more strength to cope. We already know what doesn't work when trying to stop bullying. Telling kids not to tattle does nothing to help them work through the problem; telling them that the bully will grow out of it or that people get nicer in high school and in college -- even if that's what we remember happening -- also falls on deaf ears. But empowering bystanders to take action can help alleviate the severity of bullying throughout the school. The bullies miss their rewards; the victims feel someone's on their side; the witnesses, who make up most of the student body anyway, have a better learning environment. Should targeted kids and witnesses still report the problem? Of course. But knowing how they can have a hand in its solution can inspire them to be part of it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Carl Azuz.","Carl Azuz: The most common remedy for bullying is ""tell someone""

"Remedios, Cuba (CNN) -- For 200 years, folks in Remedios, a small town in the Cuban countryside, have shared the legendary tale of Father Francisco Vigil de Quiñones. As the story goes, Father Vigil was annoyed that so few of his parishioners were attending his church's Christmas Eve midnight Mass. So the Catholic priest had an idea. He employed a few of the town's children to create a ruckus that would get people out of bed and into the pews. They threw rocks, beat sticks and awoke the town, prompting them to fill the church. Two centuries later, on Christmas Eve 2010, the ruckus remains, but the worshippers have disappeared. The town's current priest, Father Agustin Ibarra Diaz, stood overlooking the same house of worship -- gazing at a sanctuary completely empty of parishioners. Outside the colonial-era church, salsa music blared. The actions of his predecessor have had disastrous results for Ibarra. The type of pre-midnight Mass disturbances evolved over the centuries. Brass instruments were played. Large colorful floats with flashing lights were built. And then, of course, there were the fireworks. It's the fireworks that have Ibarra worried. And they are not just any pyrotechnic rockets but a homemade strain -- with names like morteros, voladores and palomas -- designed to create the biggest bangs and brightest flashes and most smoke possible. They don't always fly straight up. ""Its tough to be a priest and give Mass when there are rockets going off. People can't really enjoy the Eucharist, the birth of Jesus,"" Ibarra said, regret in his voice. ""We're afraid that rockets will fly into the church and kill someone."" Ibarra said he appreciates the effort that goes into the celebration and festivities. But this year, for safety reasons, he decided to cancel the Mass. If Remedios misses the evening services, it doesn't show. Outside the church, the town's small plaza is nearly full of residents and visitors. At each corner of the town square, a large float rises three stories into the air. One float has an arctic theme, with carved wolves and penguins standing in fake snow. Thousands of colored lights dot the float and illuminate the square at nightfall. Dotting the square are food stands offering lechon, slow-cooked whole pig, its skin crunchy and colored a deep amber from hours over the coals. For less than a U.S. dollar, vendors will carve off a few slices of the meat. Although it's still early, the square's one bar is close to being sold out of Havana Club rum. About 5 p.m., the first fireworks are being set up, and eagerness is growing for the party to begin. The pyrotechnics are the work of so-called artilleros, or artillery men. ""We've been doing this for generations and generations,"" artillero Pablo Torres said. ""My dad did it; my son does; everyone does."" Wearing a bright orange construction helmet, Torres said he's not afraid of getting hurt by the explosives. He offers a bottle of yellow liquid: ""Drink some rum, and you will be all set."" The first barrage of fireworks shakes the town. Thousands of skyrockets scream into the sky, which is soon dark from smoke. The explosives called palomas, or doves, fly up with a stream of sparks. The artilleros fill lead pipes with homemade bombs that then blast forth. Some of the firework specialists use Cuban cigars to ignite the fireworks. For safety, many of them wear thick olive-green canvas shirts and small straw hats that are usually the uniform of sugar cane cutters. Others wear only T-shirts and shorts while they play with fire. The fireworks shoot off in every direction, and flaming shrapnel comes falling back down to the square. Someone ends up getting burned every year, say the locals, but there are few serious injuries. The only death anyone can remember was a woman killed years ago after an errant rocket flew into a building where gunpowder was stored. That there are no worse injuries amid the hours of explosions seems miraculous. But so are the festivals themselves. While the entire country faces crippling shortages and economic challenges, Remedios still cobbles together everything it needs for the big spectacle. The parrandas bring in tourists despite the fact that the town has only one 10-room hotel. Andres Carrillo has come home to Remedios from New Jersey. His mother is renting out every bedroom in her house to foreign tourists. Carrillo said the festivals may bring in badly needed funds, but they are still put on to honor tradition. ""We are addicted to the fire and the smoke,"" Carrillo said while dodging a rocket. ""You see that people are not from here because they cover their nose. We don't. We love this.""","Huge 200 year-old Christmas Eve fireworks fest ignites joy in Remedios, Cuba .

"(Health.com) -- Caffeinated alcoholic beverages such as Four Loko have come under fire from lawmakers and public health officials in recent weeks, following reports of hospitalizations and even some deaths tied to the potent drinks. Now, a new study suggests that combining caffeine and alcohol can pose a risk to young people even when the substances aren't mixed in the same can or cup. College students who consume nonalcoholic energy drinks such as Red Bull at least once a week are more than twice as likely as their peers to show signs of alcohol dependence, including withdrawal symptoms and an inability to cut back on drinking, according to the study. Health.com: Do you have a drinking problem? ""The odds were fairly strong, especially when you look at the dose of energy drink used,"" says the lead researcher, Amelia Arria, PhD, director of the Center on Young Adult Health and Development at the University of Maryland School of Public Health, in College Park. The study, which appears in the journal Alcoholism: Clinical & Experimental Research, was based on interviews with about 1,100 college seniors. The findings do not show cause and effect, and it's unclear whether energy-drink consumption is directly linked to alcohol problems. For instance, students who spend a lot of time partying may simply be more likely to resort to energy drinks to help them pull all-nighters and cram for tests, the researchers say. On the other hand, energy-drink consumption could be a more immediate symptom of alcohol problems -- if a student often drinks Red Bull in the morning to shake off hangovers, say. Health.com: Being choosy about booze helps avoid hangover (to a point) Another possibility is that energy drinks actively contribute to problem drinking. If mixed with alcohol -- a common practice among college students -- caffeine-laden energy drinks can prolong drinking sessions and mask the feeling of drunkenness, potentially raising the risk for dangerous binges and behavior. (This has been the main concern with caffeinated alcoholic beverages, including Four Loko.) ""Caffeine keeps you awake but just as impaired,"" Arria says. ""You may feel as if you can get into a car or play a risky game. That's why this feeling of wide awake drunkenness is more dangerous."" A similar dynamic can exacerbate alcohol problems over the long term, says Jeffrey Parsons, PhD, a professor of psychology and public health at Hunter College, in New York City. Consuming energy drinks ""masks the extent of the drinking in such a way that it can sneak up on people,"" he says. ""They don't realize that they're developing the problematic patterns that are characteristic of alcohol abuse and dependence."" Health.com: Can a bigger booze tax reduce disease, crime? Nearly two-thirds of the students in the study reported having an energy drink in the past year, and just over half said they consumed the drinks about once a month or less. About 10 percent of the students consumed the drinks weekly, and roughly 3 percent did so daily, or almost daily. Red Bull was the most popular drink. Compared to those who consumed energy drinks rarely or not at all, students who consumed them at least once a week drank alcohol more frequently and in greater amounts, on average. They were also more likely to experience blackouts, skip class or other activities due to hangovers, be involved in a fraternity or sorority, and meet the criteria for alcohol dependence. The researchers took into account a number of other student characteristics, including sex, race, socioeconomic status, depression symptoms, and total alcohol consumption. Factors such as depression were associated with alcohol problems, as expected, but energy-drink consumption was independently linked to alcohol dependence even after controlling for all risk factors. Health.com: Family, friends are big influence on drinking . Energy drinks -- which include brands such as Monster, Rockstar, and Amp, in addition to Red Bull (by far the market leader) -- generated about $5 billion in U.S. sales in 2008 and have skyrocketed in popularity. Although the economic downturn appears to have somewhat slowed their growth, sales of the beverages in the U.S. increased by 136 percent between 2005 and 2009, according to the market research firm Mintel. The American Beverage Association, a trade group that represents the makers and distributors of nonalcoholic beverages (including Red Bull, Monster, Rockstar, and Amp), emphasized in a statement that the study did not prove a direct link between energy-drink consumption and alcohol problems. The findings ""do not show that energy drinks encourage misuse of alcohol in any way and state that further research is warranted,"" the association said. The association also said that the amount of caffeine in most energy drinks is comparable to that in 1 to 2 cups of coffee. (In the study, Arria and her colleagues did control for caffeine intake from sources other than energy drinks.) Energy drinks contain anywhere from 50 to 500 milligrams of caffeine per can, but the caffeine content is largely unregulated and isn't required to be listed on the label, Arria says. Health.com: 12 surprising sources of caffeine . In 2009, Arria joined a group of scientists in asking the FDA to review the safety of premixed caffeinated alcoholic drinks. Although the new study did not look specifically at these products, the risk of alcohol dependence associated with drinks such as Four Loko may be even greater, Parsons says. People with alcohol problems who are determined to mix caffeine and alcohol ""don't need help from the manufacturer,"" he explains. ""But for those who haven't developed a problem, the ease with which they can get drinks that have the combination in them makes it more likely they're going to try these out in a way that can potentially have negative consequences."" The Food and Drug Administration is expected to make an announcement about caffeinated alcoholic beverages on Wednesday, according to news reports. In a press release, Senator Charles Schumer (D--N.Y.) said Tuesday that the FDA ""will rule that caffeine is an unsafe food additive to alcohol beverages,"" effectively banning the sale of the beverages in the U.S. Copyright Health Magazine 2010 .","The amount of caffeine in most energy drinks is comparable to that in 1 to 2 cups of coffee .

Nuremberg could have moved up to seventh place with victory, but slumped to a sixth league defeat this season -- and third in a row -- to remain on 18 points. Striker Schurrle scored his sixth of the season in the 27th minute, pouncing from close range after Malik Fathi guided Christian Fuchs' corner towards the visiting goal. Captain Noveski doubled the lead nine minutes after halftime, with the Macedonia defender on hand to finish when Schurrle flicked on Fuchs' free-kick. Nuremberg's on-loan midfielder Jens Hegeler then headed against the crossbar before Allagui sealed the victory with a superb solo effort with four minutes to play.

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- South Korea and the United States began assembling ships for joint war exercises Sunday off the west coast of the Korean peninsula in the Yellow Sea, a source at the South Korean Joint Chiefs told CNN. The exercises are set to begin as diplomats worked to ease tensions in the Koreas after North Korea warned of unpredictable ""consequences"" if the United States fulfills its vow of deploying an aircraft carrier to the Yellow Sea for joint military maneuvers with South Korea. The exercises are scheduled to begin at 3 p.m. Sunday (1 a.m. ET). China's foreign minister spoke with his Russian, U.S., and Japanese counterparts, and a Chinese representative visited Seoul as envoys underscored the need to lower the temperature in the longtime flash-point region, days after four South Koreans died when North Korea shelled Yeonpyeong Island. North Korea said the South provoked the Tuesday attack because shells from a South Korean military drill landed in the North's waters. South Korea was holding its annual Hoguk military drill when the North started its shelling, and the South returned fire. North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency on Saturday slammed South Korea and the United States for provoking the crisis. It called reports of civilian casualties part of South Korea's ""propaganda campaign"" and accused the ""enemy"" of creating ""a human shield by deploying civilians around artillery positions and inside military facilities before the launch of the provocation."" ""If the U.S. brings its carrier to the West Sea of Korea at last, no one can predict the ensuing consequences,"" said KCNA, referring to the aircraft carrier USS George Washington, which is set to join South Korea's forces near the coasts of China and North Korea for the four-day military drill scheduled to start Sunday. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Nicole Thompson called the claims ""outrageous."" ""This is just another example of North Korea's own internal propaganda. The North Koreans for many years, including the Cheonan warship incident, have taken provocative action. This didn't have anything to do with U.S. actions,"" Thompson told CNN, referring to the sinking of a South Korean ship in March that left 46 people on board dead. The United States and South Korea blame the sinking on the North, which has consistently denied responsibility. Diplomats, seeking a lessening of tensions and a return to the six-party talks with North Korea over the country's nuclear aspirations, busily labored to avert more hostilities. The United States, China, Japan, Russia, South Korea and North Korea are the six countries that have been involved in the talks, which were put on hold in 2008. ""These parties should call on the DPRK and South Korea to exercise calmness and restraint and hold dialogue and make contacts, and not to take actions that would escalate the conflict,"" China's official Xinhua news agency quoted Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi as saying. China is North Korea's largest trading partner. Yang and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov ""stressed the need to prevent the situation from exacerbating and to work toward relieving the tensions,"" according to the Russian Foreign Ministry. Xinhua reported that Japanese Foreign Minister Seiji Maehara said his country ""is willing to work together with China to joint safeguard peace and stability on the Korean peninsula."" And a Twitter message from U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spoke with Yang on Friday and ""encouraged Beijing to make clear that North Korea's behavior is unacceptable."" Meanwhile, Dai Bingguo, a Chinese state councilor, sat down with South Korean Foreign Minister Kim Sung-hwan in Seoul to discuss the tensions. The violence has sparked anger and political turmoil in South Korea. The country's defense minister, Kim Tae-young resigned after the exchange of fire, and veterans of the South Korean military protested Saturday on the streets of Seoul, stating they were angry that their country's government had not done enough to respond to the North's shelling. One group of protesters gathered near the defense ministry building Saturday, clashing with police officers with some charging and kicking officers. Two South Korean marines were among the four killed in the shelling. Hundreds of mourners attended their nationally televised funeral Saturday, weeping before photos of the two men set among an array of flowers. As for Sunday's joint military exercises, China appeared to criticize them Friday and Chinese analysts warned against the United States and South Korea embarking on ""sensitive and provocative military actions."" ""We oppose any party to take any military acts in our exclusive economic zone without permission,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said in a statement, Xinhua reported. But the United States has described the drill as defensive in nature. The exercises were planned months ago, and are meant to underscore strong ties between South Korea and the United States, defense officials from both countries have said. There will be no live firing element in the drills; live firing exercises can only take place in a designated training range or in a closed-off area at sea, Cmdr. Jeff Davis, public affairs officer for the U.S. 7th Fleet, and such firing exercises are not possible given the amount of traffic in the area. The drills will include anti-air attack and anti-surface-attack exercises, communications and data drills, expert exchanges, logistical support, and replenishment drills. For example, a Korean oil tanker will refuel a U.S. ship, Davis said. But the prospect of more violence has prompted alarm across the region. Japan's Kyodo news agency reported that Japanese ""Cabinet members have been ordered to stay in Tokyo until Wednesday and be at their ministry offices within an hour in the event emergency situations develop."" South Korea said Thursday that it will strengthen its rules of engagement in the Yellow Sea. South Korean marine forces based in five islands near North Korea and the disputed Northern Limit Line also will be reinforced, a government spokesman said. The tense maritime border between the two Koreas has become the major military flash point on the Korean peninsula in recent years. The Yeonpyeong attack was the first direct artillery assault on South Korea since 1953, when an armistice ended fighting, though both Koreas are still technically at war.

"(CNN) -- Iran has hanged a man convicted of spying for Israel and also executed another man who was a member of a government opposition group, state-run media reported Tuesday. The executions took place at Tehran's Evin Prison at dawn Tuesday. Ali-Akbar Siadat was sentenced to death for working as a spy for Israeli intelligence. The Islamic Republic News Agency said Siadat admitted to transferring information to Israel over several years in exchange for $60,000. He was arrested in 2008 while trying to leave Iran along with his wife, the news agency said. A second man, Ali Saremi, was hanged for ""fighting against the sacred Islamic Republic of Iran system and launching antagonist propagations,"" the agency reported.

"(Health.com) -- The number of infants and toddlers under age 2 who landed in emergency rooms after ingesting too much over-the-counter cold medicine dropped by more than half following the discontinuation of medicines targeted to that age group, a new study has found. In 2007, drug manufacturers voluntarily pulled infant cough-and-cold medicines from store shelves amid concerns about the products' effectiveness and side effects, including a risk of rapid heart rate, convulsions, loss of consciousness, and even death. At the time, experts worried that parents would start dosing their toddlers with other, stronger medications, which would potentially cause even worse problems. Health.com: 9 ways to stay sniffle-free . ""There was some controversy,"" says Daniel Budnitz, M.D., a medical officer in the Medication Safety Program at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in Atlanta, Georgia. ""Some folks suggested that it would be a bad thing because parents would use adult-strength formulas for infants and not know how to dose them."" But that doesn't seem to have happened. The new study, which was co-authored by Budnitz and appears in the journal Pediatrics, found that cold medicine-related ER visits by children under the age of 2 dropped by 55 percent in the 14-month period after the product withdrawal, compared with the 14 months immediately before. Using data collected from a representative sample of 63 hospitals across the U.S., the researchers estimated that there were about 2,800 ER visits before the product withdrawal and about 1,250 after. Health.com: How to sick-proof your winter . And there did not appear to be any uptick in problems related to other medications, such as antibiotics, that parents might have been giving their children instead of cough-and-cold medicine. Both before and after the product withdrawal, the vast majority of ER visits resulted from overdoses. More than half of the children under age 2 who landed in the ER had found and ingested the medicines on their own. The remaining visits were caused by caregiver errors -- such as a parent mixing up two siblings' medicines or confusing the abbreviations for teaspoon and tablespoon, for instance. (Many of the discontinued products were liquids.) Although Budnitz and his co-authors can't say with absolute certainty that the sharp drop in ER visits was caused by the product withdrawal, it does seem likely. The overall number of ER visits among kids under 12 remained the same in the pre- and post-withdrawal periods, which suggests that the decline was limited to infants and toddlers. Health.com: 5 most common myths about the common cold . Even after the 2007 withdrawal, doctors and public-health officials have continued to question the use of cough-and-cold medicines in young children. Aside from the safety risk, research has consistently shown that pediatric products are largely ineffective at relieving symptoms. In response to the safety concerns, medicine manufacturers have taken steps to standardize their dosing devices. And in 2008, after conferring with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), they voluntarily changed their product labels to say the medicines should not be used in children under age 4. The study findings support that change, says Budnitz. Neil Herendeen, M.D., a pediatrician at the University of Rochester Medical Center, in New York, says the study provides a compelling reason to withdraw all pediatric cough-and-cold medicines for kids under 12 from the market, a policy he supports. ""This shows that if you take it off the market, it will reduce the adverse events,"" Herendeen says. Health.com: Top 7 natural cold remedies: do they work? Difficult as it is for parents to stand by and do nothing while their infants suffer with runny noses and hacking coughs, there really isn't any way to make a cold go away, only to ease some of the symptoms, experts say. ""You're left with doing all the things your grandmother used to tell you: lots of fluids; vaporizers, but don't put any menthol medications in it, just plain water; blow your nose; and salt water drops,"" Dr. Herendeen says. Jeff Sleeth, M.D., an assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health in Madison, says that it's important to keep a sick infant's environment as well humidified as possible. That ""allows the mucous and secretions that are in the nose and back of the throat to stay nice and thin so, [so] when the child does cough, it's easier to clear the secretions out,"" Sleeth says.

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Amarynth Sichel grills cheese sandwiches and sells them to Columbia University students five nights a week. But Sichel's not just a cook; she's also a college student and social entrepreneur-in-training. Sichel is the president of one of 23 ""FeelGood World"" chapters on U.S. college campuses, where students donate time and cooking skills to raise money for charity. Social entrepreneurship has surged on American campuses in the past few years, according to Melanie Edwards, who lectures on the subject at Stanford University. ""I believe the rise in 'Social E' publicity, coupled with the heightened social problems in our U.S. economy and the world, speaks to the millenials,"" Edwards said. A growing number of college applicants ask about Stanford's social entrepreneurship program before applying, and freshman enrollment in ""Social E"" classes has increased, she said. ""I was a devout grilled cheese-maker in high school, so for me, joining FeelGood was a must,"" said Sichel. ""I have always been committed to groups that are dedicated to uplifting the world. When you know you're working for your global family, that's a powerful motivator."" Sandwich sales help sustainable village programs, including CHOICE Humanitarian and The Hunger Project. The social entrepreneurship trend has many schools rethinking curriculum and recruiting strategies. Harvard recently introduced courses in social entrepreneurship and rewards students' social startups in its annual Innovation Challenge. Columbia joined the ""College Challenge"" -- a competition among 17 colleges to determine which academic institution has the greatest commitment to civic engagements. At Babson College, all freshmen take a two-semester course that includes 20 hours of community service. Students are required to create an idea and launch a venture funded by the college. They pay back their seed funding with money from sales at the end of the course. Babson now offers 17 courses in social entrepreneurship, up from five classes in 2005. Stanford's alternative spring break has students visiting social enterprises ranging from education to criminal rehabilitation. Students can also apply for grants to help build their own social enterprises. Sophomore Nishant Jacob said he chose Stanford because of its ""Social E"" opportunities. ""Coming to Stanford was an amazing way to get immersed in the world of 'Social E',"" said Jacob, who ran a small startup in Bangalore before being admitted to Stanford. New York University sponsors an annual competition that provides $1,000 seed grants and a prize of $20,000 for teams that develop organizations with a positive, sustainable and measurable impact on their communities. The level of enthusiasm and participation has increased among students worldwide, according to Gabriel Brodbar, director of NYU's Reynolds Program in Social Entrepreneurship. ""There is a greater recognition today among young people that regardless of sector or profession, they have an active responsibility to meaningfully address some of the intractable social challenges that we are facing,"" said Brodbar, who is developing a university-wide ""Social E"" concentration.

"(CNN) -- Heavy snowfall in Germany has caused part of the roof to collapse at the Veltins Arena, which hosts Bundesliga soccer team Schalke 04. The stadium, in Gelsenkirchen, stages all Schalke's home games and was also due to hold the annual biathlon World Team Challenge later this week. But the event has been cancelled after a deluge of snow over Christmas created a hole measuring 1,000 square meters in the roof. Three fibre glass strips that hold the roof in place were destroyed. ""The holes are not going to be closed in time,'' Schalke's chairman Peter Peters said of the biathlon on the club's official website. ""The safety of the spectators is the utmost priority.'' Football's heroes and villains of 2010 . The Bundesliga is currently on its winter break, with Schalke not scheduled to play at the Veltins Arena until the January 15 clash with Hamburg. But that match is not thought to be in danger, as it can be played with the roof open. ""I am optimistic that we will be able to start the second half of the season according to schedule,"" Peters said. Staff had cleared an earlier downfall prior to Christmas but were unable to get onto the roof after that due to harsh weather conditions. The stadium was opened in 2001 and can hold 61,482 spectators.

"(CNN) -- More than two years after undergoing a landmark, near-total face transplant at the Cleveland Clinic, Connie Culp said Monday she was happy with the transformation. ""I can smell now,"" the grandmother told CNN. ""I can eat steak, I can eat almost any solid foods -- so it's all getting better."" Culp recently met with the family of the donor, Anna Kasper of Lakewood, Ohio, who had worked in a nursing home and whose donated body parts helped 50 people. ""It was scary at first, but we had a really good time and they explained to me what happened to (the donor) and they were just so sweet,"" Culp said. ""I mean, she was a nurse in a rest home and she was a donor from the beginning so it was easy for them to make the decision."" Culp said Kasper's family told her the two do not look much like each other. ""They said the only resemblance is my nose,"" she said. Instead, her face reflects a combination of Kasper's and her own before it was disfigured in 2004 by a shotgun blast that shattered her nose, cheeks and upper lip. ""I think my face is actually starting to come back a little bit,"" Culp said Monday. She received Kasper's nose, upper lip and cheekbones in a 22-hour operation on December 10, 2008 -- the first of 30 surgical procedures. Though her sense of feeling has gotten stronger in her face, her sense of humor has remained intact. Asked how she is feeling, she answered, ""Like everybody else is -- I'm trying to stay warm."" But Culp's medical odyssey is not over. Her continuing recuperative regimen includes taking anti-rejection medication and doing exercises to strengthen her facial muscles, she said. ""I pronounce the vowels really strongly, like AHHHHHH,"" she said. Culp expressed gratitude to the many people who have written her expressing their support and to whom she is trying to respond with notes of her own.

"(CNN) -- A three-goal blitz in nine minutes sent Arsenal second in the English Premier League as they finally ended their hoodoo against champions Chelsea by winning 3-1 at Emirates Stadium on Monday night. Goals from Alex Song, Cesc Fabregas and Theo Walcott put Arsene Wenger's side two points behind leaders Manchester United, and ended a run of five successive defeats to Chelsea. Branislav Ivanovic pulled a goal back for the visitors, but it wasn't enough to end their miserable run of form as they continue to search for their first win since early November. The Gunners were handed a boost before kickoff as Spain midfielder Fabregas was restored to the starting lineup, as well as Dutch striker Robin Van Persie, but Chelsea's French forward Nicolas Anelka was absent with a knee injury. Football's heroes and villains of 2010 . The first half was a scrappy affair as Chelsea sat back and invited their opponents to attack them, with neither side creating much in the way of goalscoring opportunities. But that all changed five minutes before the break as Samir Nasri forced Chelsea keeper Petr Cech into a fine save with an effort that was curling towards the top corner. And just four minutes later Arsenal were ahead. Song exchanged passes with Wilshere, before picking up a loose ball in the area and driving it into the corner of the net. The home side came roaring out of the traps in the second half, as Walcott latched onto a loose pass from Michael Essien and drew Cech before squaring to Fabregas, who stroked the ball into an empty net on 51 minutes. Little more than a minute later the roles were reversed as Fabregas clipped a ball through to Walcott, who fired low past Cech from the edge of the area. Chelsea gave themselves a glimmer of hope on 57 minutes as Ivanovic glanced Didier Drogba's curling freekick into the net, but despite committing plenty of men forward the champions couldn't fashion a way back into the match. Nasri and Abou Diaby had chances to compound Chelsea's misery, but both squandered late opportunities. Chelsea's defeat is bound to heap more pressure on their Italian manager Carlo Ancelotti, who has presided over a wretched run of just one win in eight games. ""We have to wake up because we are asleep,"" he told Sky Sports after the game. ""We did not play well but Arsenal did and they deserved to win. We must stay focused and continue to work hard.""

"(CNN) -- Thinking about death can be frightening, no matter your age or medical condition. As we get older, the reality of our own mortality tends to come into clearer focus; this doesn't make talking about death or life-sustaining treatments any less frightening though. It was fear -- stoked by certain politicians -- that led to the inaccurate and misguided ""death panel"" rumors that surrounded health care reform proposals last year. Beginning January 1, Medicare will reimburse physicians who advise patients, in voluntary discussions, about their preferences for end-of-life care treatment during their annual Medicare ""wellness visit."" This is advance care planning, and it is a good thing for seniors, their families and health care professionals. It's not new. A law passed in 2008 allowed end-of-life planning to be part of a patient's ""welcome to Medicare"" exam. Health care reform turned the welcome visit into an annual wellness visit. And now regulations clarify that these important discussions will be covered should the Medicare beneficiary wish to take advantage of this opportunity. Advance care planning allows a person to make his or her wishes and care preferences known before being faced with a medical crisis. Advance care planning is simply smart life-planning. Another way to think about advance care planning is that it's like planning a trip to an unfamiliar destination. If you're like many people, once you have your destination in mind, you begin mapping the route you will take to get there. Some people consult AAA or Google Maps to help them chart their course. Other people talk to friends and family members about their experiences on their trips. While people approach mapping their route in differing ways, few would expect to arrive at their destination safely and comfortably without having a well-thought out map in hand before hitting the road. Yet only 30% of Americans have a living will, a map detailing where they want their health care to go should they become unable to voice their wishes. An individual's personal wishes, beliefs and values are among the most important factors when making care decisions brought about by a serious or life-limiting illness. Such wishes and preferences can be known only if they are discussed openly. Research has shown that patient-physician discussions result in a higher quality of life for patients and their family caregivers facing the end of a life. By having Medicare cover these voluntary consultations, beneficiaries will be able to get information that will help them make their own decisions about their care and what they would or would not want at life's end. And it's only appropriate that patients should be able to have these discussions with the very physicians who have been caring for them and that these doctors be compensated for this valuable service. An advance care planning consultation is not about limiting or rationing care. It's not about hastening death. It's not about having choices made for the patient. It's not about saving money. Advance care planning is about examining options, planning and communicating the choices that the individual wants -- either to limit treatments, accept all treatments or something in between. The course charted is decided by individual patients, not their doctors, and certainly not the government. Advance care planning includes completing a living will and appointing a health care proxy. A living will charts the course for your health care, letting your family and health care providers know what procedures and treatments you would want provided to you and under what conditions. A health care proxy or health care power of attorney form allows you to choose someone you trust to take charge of your health care decisions in case you are unable to make those decisions yourself. Advance directives, as these documents are also known, can be changed as an individual's situation or wishes change. Based on my 35 years of experience running hospice programs and caring for people at life's end, I know firsthand that frank, open discussions with one's health care providers can relieve anxiety about a situation that we all will one day face. It makes sense that Medicare help facilitate this important planning. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of J. Donald Schumacher.","Donald Schumacher says many fear talking about how they want end-of-life care handled .
Some politicians stoked fear with misinformation to try to derail health reform, he says .

"(CNN) -- The search for an American -- whose wife says he was shot on a lake that straddles the U.S.-Mexican border -- has been suspended, a Mexican official said Friday. David Hartley was reportedly shot to death September 30 by gunmen investigators believe are linked to a Mexican drug gang. At present, there are no Mexican agencies actively searching Falcon Lake for Hartley. But the mother of Tiffany Hartley -- the woman who says her husband was shot --  says she's ""hopeful that they'll restart on Monday,"" after meeting with Mexican officials on Friday. Cynthia Young, Tiffany's mother, said said that she, her daughter and Tiffany's dad met with Mexican and American officials for about 8 hours on Friday. Young would not specify which officials attended the meeting but said the family was told that the Mexican government was ""restrategizing"" how it is handling the search for Hartley's body. Young said that the day mostly entailed Tiffany refiling a witness statement with Mexican officials, recounting what happened on the day she said he was killed. Young said the meeting occurred in McAllen, Texas, where Tiffany and her husband had recently relocated. Earlier in the day, Tamaulipas state attorney general spokesman Ruben Dario Rios explained the decision to halt the search. ""Our investigators have taken a temporary recess so that we can better assess the strategies we are using to find the body. We are currently considering other approaches to our search,"" he said. The search was suspended on Thursday. Responding to local reports that it may have been threats of imminent gun battles by the Los Zetas cartel that led to Mexican officials to suspend the search, Dario Rios said, ""Negative."" ""We have no official information of threats on our investigators."" Tiffany's mother said that ""we're very disappointed"" in the development. ""The longer this goes the less chance there is of finding David,"" she said. Tiffany Hartley  told authorities the couple was on a sightseeing trip on Falcon Lake, a reservoir on the Rio Grande. She believes the attackers may still have her husband's body. Dario Rios said earlier Friday taht Tiffany Hartley has not responded to the attorney general's formal request for more information about the incident. ""We still have not spoken to her,"" he said. Young had said her daughter is willing to meet with Mexican authorities on her terms and on U.S. soil, not in Mexico. Tamaulipas state governor Eugenio Hernandez Flores, in Washington for annual meetings on Mexican-U.S. partnerships, was scheduled to  meet with FBI officials during his visit Friday to pledge cooperation as authorities look into the matter. He told CNN that Mexican police had deployed dozens of searchers but have found neither a body nor a jet ski. Tiffany said she met with the lead Mexican investigator in the death of her husband days before the police officer was killed and his severed head delivered to authorities in a suitcase. U.S. and Mexican authorities vowed the search for Hartley's husband would continue despite the investigator's slaying on Tuesday. ""I met him. He sat right next to me,"" Hartley said, referring to Mexican state official Rolando Armando Flores Villegas. Her remarks aired on CNN's ""American Morning"" Thursday. ""We talked through a translator and he just seemed like a really good guy who really wanted to just do good for -- you know, his country,"" Hartley said. Hartley said she wonders if the death of the lead Mexican investigator will hamper the search for her husband. ""It definitely makes me worried that nobody is going to want to take over,"" she said. On Thursday, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the United States is doing everything it can to find Hartley and told ABC's ""Good Morning America"" that she is ""sickened"" by the case. ""I hope that we can [find him],"" said Clinton. ""I mean, the beheaded body of the brave Mexican investigator that just showed up shows what we're dealing with."" She said the United States is ""supporting local law enforcement, supporting the authorities on the border, doing everything that we know to do to try to assist in helping to find the body and helping to find the perpetrators."" A report issued by a Texas-based think tank suggested Thursday that Hartley's death may have stemmed from a case of mistaken identity in the ongoing war between two Mexican drug cartels. The Stratfor report, which cites anonymous sources, noted that Hartley worked for an oil and gas company with operations in Reynosa, Mexico. The couple had lived there for two years and had only moved to McAllen within the past few months, the report said. The truck they drove to Falcon Lake on September 30 still had a license plate from Mexico's Tamaulipas state. The couple drove their personal watercraft to the Old Guerrero area of the lake, which the report said is a ""known battleground in the ongoing war in the Los Zetas and Gulf cartels."" The sources told Stratfor both cartels have been known to conduct surveillance and countersurveillance operations on personal watercraft, so Zetas scouts identified them as possible Gulf spies, because of their license plate and their method and direction of travel on Falcon Lake. They were then apparently confronted by ""Zetas enforcers,"" Stratfor said. The sources told Stratfor the attack was unauthorized by senior Los Zetas members and ""a damage control campaign is currently under way ... to identify and eliminate those who engaged the Hartleys without proper authorization."" Protocol involves prompt disposition of a body to ensure no evidence can be brought against the group, the report said. Sources said that ""once Hartley was identified as an American, his body was destroyed the same day as the incident to prevent a backlash from the U.S. government against the group,"" Stratfor said. ""With the heavy diplomatic and public pressure on both U.S. and Mexican authorities to find David Hartley's remains in the investigation, the decapitation of Flores Villegas was a stern signal to both the United States and Mexico that no body will be produced and to leave the situation alone."" Falcon Lake is about 70 miles west of the Hartleys' home in McAllen.

"New York (CNN) -- An ""all-clear"" was given at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport Wednesday night after a DHL cargo facility there was evacuated following the discovery of a suspicious package, authorities said. The package originated from Yemen -- the source of last week's thwarted bomb plot -- said New York Police Department Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne. The package was an envelope containing a cell phone and paperwork, Browne said. Investigators said they were looking at a ""solid mass"" in the package at JFK that showed up on an X-ray and was inconsistent with what they had been told were documents in the package. The package was addressed to a New York destination, a law enforcement source said. ""The bomb squad was called in to check it out,"" the NYPD's Browne said. ""It was cleared."" The package was discovered at 6:30 p.m. ET Wednesday, an official said. FBI agents, Port Authority police and U.S. Customs and Border Protection had inspected the package ""out of an abundance of caution,"" New York FBI spokesman Rich Kolko said. ""All clear. DHL got their signals crossed,"" John Kelly, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, told CNN. ""All is well and over."" A DHL spokeswoman, Beatrice Garcia, confirmed some information about the suspicious package but rejected the Port Authority's statement about the delivery company getting its signals crossed. Senior law enforcement officials said the package was one of the more than a dozen packages from Yemen that investigators had been looking for since Friday. At least seven other packages from that batch have been cleared by U.S. officials. Earlier Wednesday, the head of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration visited Yemen, five days after authorities disrupted a plot to send bombs from the Middle Eastern nation to the United States, the federal agency announced. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, meanwhile, talked about cargo screening with top representatives of global shipping companies including DHL, FedEx, TNT and UPS, her department said. She talked about ""enhanced screening"" after shipping companies apparently carried the bombs unawares. She pressed home the same message in a call to the head of the International Air Transport Association, Giovanni Bisignani, the department said. TSA Administrator John Pistole met with Yemeni government officials, including Deputy Prime Minister Rashad al-Alimi, representatives from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation and the Ministry of Interior, and U.S. ambassador Gerald Feierstein, the TSA said. Pistole also received briefings from TSA inspectors deployed to Yemen and toured a cargo facility in Sanaa, the nation's capital. Yemen said Monday that it is tightening security at all of its airports. Authorities in the United Arab Emirates and Britain found two packages Friday with explosives that were destined for synagogues in Chicago, Illinois. The explosive found in the United Arab Emirates may have traveled on passenger planes to get there, airline officials said Sunday. Investigators in Yemen say they strongly suspect that Ibrahim Hasan al-Asiri, al Qaeda's top bomb maker in the region, is behind the explosive devices sent in the parcels. U.S. authorities are said to be also looking at al-Asiri because the parcel bombs used the same explosive, PETN, as last year's foiled underwear bomber, also linked to him. A 23-year-old Nigerian citizen, Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, has been charged with trying to blow up a December 25 flight from the Netherlands to Detroit, Michigan, with an explosive that was partly sewn into his underwear. A Yemen-based branch of the al Qaeda terrorist network claimed responsibility for that attempt. After last week's incident, the TSA and U.S. Customs and Border Protection took immediate steps to enhance measures for screening inbound cargo, including grounding packages originating from Yemen destined for the U.S., the TSA said. The agencies also deployed a team of inspectors to assist the government of Yemen with its cargo screening procedures. The day before visiting Yemen, Pistole spoke to the International Air Transport Association conference in Frankfurt, Germany, met with international aviation security officials and signed an international security agreement with Germany, the TSA said. CNN's Susan Candiotti, Deb Feyerick, Ross Levitt and Fran Townsend contributed to this report.","Package at airport had New York destination, law enforcement source says .

"(CNN) -- An American amateur golfer is poised to extend an incredible world record on December 26 as he aims to complete his 600th round of 2010. Richard Lewis holds the Guinness Book of World Records' title of ""Most Avid Golfer"" after breaking the mark of most rounds played in a year when he finished his 587th on December 19. The 64-year-old, who has played as many as 54 holes in a day, will take to the tee at the Four Seasons Resort and Club in the Las Colinas region of Dallas, Texas for his next milestone. He has played all of his rounds at the club's TPC venue -- which hosts the PGA Tour's Byron Nelson Championship event -- and its private members' course at Cottonwood Valley. Lewis, who has walked an estimated 3,900 miles during the feat, explained how this achievement is the next best thing to being a professional golfer. ""When I was 10 years old, I wanted to be a PGA Tour pro,"" he told the tour's website. ""But it never worked out for me. Now I have another quest, another goal, which I fully intend to complete in December."" To commemorate his momentous 18 holes, Lewis will play alongside supporters who have paid more than $5,000 to compete alongside him when he starts at his usual tee-off time of 7.30 a.m. The funds raised will then be donated to ""The First Tee of Dallas,"" a local charity aimed at improving the lives of young people through golf. After his effort on December 26, Lewis will continue to play until the end of this year, with his final total likely to stand at 611. Lewis told the PGA Tour website that he has missed only 19 days this year -- all due to bad weather. He has lost 40 pounds during the challenge despite eating at least one pizza a day plus protein drinks to keep up his strength. Four Seasons club manager Rob Cowan has hailed the veteran golfer's efforts. ""The detail to his quest is just amazing,"" Cowan said. ""Just eating healthy, staying healthy and getting ready for another round.

"Khartoum, Sudan (CNN) -- A Sudanese government delegation plans to leave peace talks with rebels from the country's western Darfur region Friday, the country's official news agency reported. The presidential advisor in charge of the talks for the government, however, said the departure does not mean the government is withdrawing from the talks, which have been taking place in Doha, Qatar. ""This does not mean that we are not willing to look over the final draft of the peace deal produced by these negotiators over the coming hours or days,"" the Sudan News Agency quoted the advisor, Ghazi Salaheldin, as saying. ""That can happen without the presence of the government delegation in Doha."" If a draft document emerges from the talks, ""it will be the foundation for a conference in Darfur. We do not want peace to be blocked,"" Salaheldin said, according to the Sudan News Agency. The Sudanese president, Omar al-Bashir, said this week that his negotiators would leave if an agreement was not reached by Thursday. Al-Bashir, who is wanted by the International Criminal Court for war crimes in the western Darfur region, said he would not deal with rebels bearing arms after the talks ended in Doha. ""These (rebel) movements are enjoying the negotiation process and their residency in foreign hotels while the people of Darfur are suffering the flames of war,"" al-Bashir said. ""We will not negotiate with anyone who carries a gun and claims to lead an armed group that represents the will of the people."" The anti-government Justice and Equality Movement, a rebel movement in Darfur, called al-Bashir's statement a declaration of war. ""What the president said yesterday has blocked the way ahead on the road to a political solution,"" said a statement from Ahmed Hussein Adam, a spokesman for the group. ""It is a declaration of war and a limiting of any future chance for peace."" Fighting erupted in Darfur in 2003 between rebel groups and al-Bashir's Arab-dominated government in Khartoum. More than 300,000 people have been killed in this desolate region, where hopes for peace have gone up and down over the last few months. Negotiators had previously set a December 31 deadline for agreement in the peace talks, which have so far not made much progress. The deadline was ahead of a key referendum on independence for Southern Sudan that begins January 9. North and South, dominated by non-Arab Christians and animists, have fought one of Africa's longest-running civil wars. The Darfur conflict is separate from the North-South divide, but independence for the South could help embolden rebels in Darfur.","The Sudanese government is leaving peace talks with rebels from Darfur .

"Washington (CNN) -- If the threat of underwear bombs became known last Christmas, why did airport screeners only recently begin aggressively checking for them? The answer is two-fold, Transportation Security Administration Director John Pistole told reporters Tuesday. First, the lack of a permanent leader at the TSA hindered change, he said. Secondly, the agency needed time to train screeners on the new pat-down protocols. The threat of hidden bombs became instantly clear on December 25, 2009, Pistole said, when authorities arrested Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, a Nigerian man, after his failed attempt to ignite his hidden explosive on a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit, Michigan. TSA officials immediately started looking at what they needed to do to modify technology or pat downs to detect the bombs, he said. But at that time, the top job at TSA was filled by a career official. The White House delayed nominating a TSA chief and then White House and Congressional Republicans feuded for a year over nominees. Much of the debate centered on whether the nominees supported unionization of airport screeners. Two of President Obama's nominees withdrew from consideration. ""Frankly it just came down to the fact there was not a presidentially appointed, Senate-confirmed administrator in place until I was confirmed at the end of June to make a really significant decision like that, that would have impact on a number of people,"" Pistole said. ""That was a big part of it."" Pistole was sworn in as administrator in July and soon thereafter made the decision to go through ""enhanced pat downs."" Training time accounts for the rest of the delay, as the TSA quietly began pilot programs in Boston, Massachusetts, and Las Vegas, Nevada, in August, and rolled the program out nationwide in early November. Pistole consistently has said it was his decision to implement enhanced pat downs. He said he opted not to publicize them in advance because he felt to do so would be to give a ""roadmap"" to would-be terrorists. Implementation of the pat downs was further delayed because time was needed to train screeners on the new protocols, he said. Those protocols are considered sensitive security information, and have not been shared with the public. But Pistole said protocols do not allow for screeners to grope passengers. Pistole said some passenger descriptions of the procedures are ""so wildly outside the standard operating protocols that it just absolutely should not be happening. If it is, then we'll take appropriate action."" ""If we receive any complaints from a passenger about something happening, then we immediately follow up both with that passenger and with our security officers,"" he said. Most airport checkpoints have closed circuit television systems, which help investigators find out what happened, he said. Videotape helped dispel one passenger's complaint that she was handcuffed to a chair and mistreated, he said. ""If there's a security officer that did something that's not appropriate, then we take appropriate action. I just want to make sure that I have all the facts,"" Pistole said.","The failed underwear bombing last Christmas raised the threat of bombs hidden in clothes .
Pistole says after that, the pat-down program was delayed by two factors .
The TSA lacked a permanent leader until July .
Extensive training also was required before implementation of the program, he says ."
"AMSTETTEN, Austria (CNN) -- Three children freed from a cellar in which their mother had been imprisoned and raped by her own father for 24 years had never seen daylight, police in Austria have confirmed. A hidden, narrow bedroom found in the cellar of the house where Josef Fritzl held his daughter captive. Police spokesman Franz Polzer told CNN that 73-year-old Josef Fritzl admitted holding his daughter, Elisabeth Fritzl, 42, hostage in the windowless cell and fathering seven children by her. ""The mother had memories [of the outside world] and got used to the situation,"" Polzer told a press conference Monday afternoon. ""The others knew nothing else."" The main question reverberating from the small Austrian town: How could a man keep his daughter locked in his basement for 24 years, where she gave birth to seven of his children while her mother and three of those children lived upstairs without an inkling of the horrors in the cellar? Fritzl explained Elisabeth's disappearance by saying she had run away from home, a story backed up by letters he forced Elisabeth to write, including one that begged her parents not to look for her. Other letters made it seem the missing daughter had left the three children on the parents' doorstep -- when in fact they had been born in captivity in the family's basement. Elisabeth told police that she and her three children Kerstin, 19; Stefan, 18; and Felix, 5, did not see the light of day during their entire time in captivity underneath the building in Amstetten, a rural town about 150 km (93 miles) west of Vienna. Elisabeth is described as ""very disturbed"" and having trouble talking to police about her ordeal, reports CNN correspondent Fred Pleitgen. She went missing in 1984, when she was 18 years old, police have said. More details also emerged at the news conference about the basement dungeon in which the daughter and her children were kept -- and how her father managed to keep them captive for more than two decades.  See inside the cellar prison » . The authorities have revealed that the prison, constructed in the basement of the 1960s building, ran underneath both the building itself and the garden outside. The entrance was via a small door, hidden behind cupboards in the basement, controlled by an electronic keyless-entry system. Polzer said that the prison was hard to find, even if someone was looking for it, and had been soundproofed. ""Even though they shouted and called they were not in a position to let anyone hear them,"" Polzer told the press conference. Polzer said that Fritzl made clear to his wife and other children that the area was out of bounds and they were not to go into the basement. He bought food and took it to his captives in the evening.  Watch a report on details of the case » . Detectives made the grim discovery about the cellar  earlier this month after Kerstin was hospitalized in Amstetten after falling unconscious and taken to a hospital in Amstetten by her grandfather with a SOS note from her mother hidden on her. A DNA test was later carried out which revealed her grandfather, Josef Fritzl, was also her father, according to ORF, Austria's state-run news agency. That sparked a police investigation, which revealed that Fritzl fathered at least six children with his daughter, forcing her and three of the surviving children to live in the cellar of his house, according to ORF's Peter Schmitzberger.  Watch police describe the captives' jail » . On Sunday, police searched the hidden rooms where Fritzl admitted he kept his daughter and their children, including sleeping quarters, a kitchen and a bathroom, which Fritzl told police he built, Polzer said. Amstetten police say they were put on Fritzl's trail following an anonymous tip off. They apprehended the pair on Saturday near the hospital and once police assured the daughter that she would never have contact with her father again, ""she was able to tell the whole story,"" Schmitzberger said. Elisabeth said her father began sexually abusing her at age 11. On August 8, 1984 -- weeks before she was reported missing -- her father enticed her into the basement, where he drugged her, put her in handcuffs and locked her in a room, she told police. For the next 24 years, she was constantly raped by her father, resulting in the six surviving children, she said, according to the police statement. She also told police she gave birth to twins in 1996, but one of the babies died a few days later as a result of neglect, and Fritzl removed the infant's body and burned it in an oven. She told police that only her father supplied her and her children with food and clothing, and that she did not think his wife knew anything about their situation . Fritzl lived upstairs with his wife, Rosemarie, who police said had no idea about her husband's other family living in the cellar. The couple adopted three of the children that Fritzl had with his daughter, according to police. He told his wife that his missing daughter had dropped the unwanted children off at the house because she could not take care of them, police said. When Kerstin fell ill, Fritzl apparently told his wife and the hospital that his ""missing"" daughter had dropped off the sick girl on his doorstep. In an effort to find out about Kerstin's condition, the hospital and police asked the media to put out a bulletin requesting any information about the girl or her missing mother, attorney general Gerhard Sedlacek told NTV. Sometime later, Fritzl brought Elisabeth out of the cellar, telling his wife that she had returned home with her two children after a 24-year absence, police said. He took Elisabeth to the hospital to talk with doctors about Kerstin's condition, and at that point, authorities became aware of her situation, Sedlacek said. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- Money, husbands, record deals or a free stay at a celebrity sober living house. Just when you thought there couldn't be a more shocking trade-off for national exposure on a reality show, E! brings you ""Bridalplasty."" The new series, set to make its debut November 28 at 9 p.m., will feature 12 brides-to-be competing for a different plastic surgery each week as they prepare to walk down the aisle. Despite ""Bridalplasty's"" unsettling tagline -- ""the only show where the winner gets cut"" -- the reality competition follows a surprisingly standard format: Each week, the contestants will participate in a wedding- or relationship-themed challenge, such as picking the perfect dress, according to Jason Sarlanis, vice president of original programming and series development for E! So what's the grand prize? The last bride standing will receive her dream wedding, paid for by the show, and the remaining procedures on a ""wish list,"" which she drafts at the beginning of the season with the help of Dr. Terry Dubrow, who appeared on Fox's ""The Swan"" in 2004. The procedures will range from veneers and Botox to breast augmentations and tummy tucks. And like many reality competition shows, a winner is granted immunity each week and thus is exempt from competing the following episode. But, on ""Bridalplasty,"" immunity is also a form of ""medical leave."" ""[Contestants] will wait until they're ready to return -- doctor's orders,"" Sarlanis said. ""They won't participate in any part of the episode that could mess with recuperation."" But recovery time is not the only concern for Dr. John Diaz, a board-certified plastic surgeon in Beverly Hills, California, who is not affiliated with the show. Diaz says, ""By competing in a show like this, patients might feel pressured to undergo surgeries they wouldn't have under normal circumstances."" That pressure, he says, can stem from contestants' peers on the show, as well as the fact that the surgeries are free. ""If a contestant is only interested in her nose, but every other woman around her is talking about her breasts, all of a sudden, she may feel pressure to do her breasts, as well,"" Diaz said. ""It's almost like a peer pressure spurred on by this competition."" Diaz also said that major events, like weddings or reunions, sometimes cause people to evaluate their appearance. ""Who doesn't want to look their best on their wedding day?"" Sarlanis said. ""Plastic surgery is a taboo topic, and a lot of people support it, and a lot of people consider it a guilty pleasure, and a lot of people are against it."" He added: ""A show like this could go different ways. At the end of the day, we're making a really great show."" Supporters and critics alike agree that ""Bridalplasty"" will most likely be a hit. ""This is the natural, absurd next step for reality programming. ... It has all the elements of what would be successful for a faceless demographic: bridal themes, aspiration themes, plastic surgery,"" said Colby Hall, the managing editor of Mediaite.com, a website that assesses print, online and broadcast media. ""It's going to be a huge hit in the way 'Jersey Shore' was a huge hit,"" he added. ""It's a train wreck to watch, but people will love to sort of feel better than the participants."" Sarah Polonsky, senior editor at BettyConfidential.com, said she's worried the show will send a negative message to viewers -- ""equating cash to plastic surgery."" ""Anyone emotionally unstable enough to desire that much plastic surgery really needs Botox for the soul,"" Polonsky said. ""They should be giving out therapy instead of nose jobs. ... When you start planning a wedding to include lip [injections] and rhinoplasty in addition to flower arrangements, it's almost as belittling to your groom as it is to yourself."" Of course, ""Bridalplasty"" is not the first TV show about plastic surgery. ""The Swan"" and ABC's ""Extreme Makeover"" both followed subjects who went under the knife to modify their appearance. These shows are a double-edged sword for plastic surgeons, said Dr. Phil Haeck, a practicing plastic surgeon in Seattle, Washington, and president of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. ""It puts plastic surgery in a possible negative light, in that it cheapens the value of surgery. ... On the other hand, it does generate some talk -- both positive and negative,"" Haeck said. ""From a marketing standpoint, any time your product is talked about generically, it may be somewhat beneficial."" And ""Bridalplasty"" is certainly generating talk. ""In today's entertainment landscape, the most absurd and crazy idea wins,"" Hall said. ""This certainly feels like the most absurd and crazy TV show in a long time.""","Reality TV show  will feature 12 brides-to-be competing for a different plastic surgeries .

"Washington (CNN) -- The United States spent $80 billion on spy activities in 2010, the first time the government has officially announced the total tab for intelligence spending. The amount included $53.1 billion on non-military intelligence programs, a 6 percent boost from the previous year, according to a statement released Thursday by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. The military spent an additional $27 billion on its intelligence apparatus, said Pentagon spokesman Col. Dave Lapan. No further details were released. The government is required by law to reveal the total amount of money spent to spy on other nations, terrorists and other groups by the CIA, the National Security Agency and the other agencies and offices that make up the 16-member intelligence community. While the total intelligence spending has never formally been announced, this is the fourth year the Office of the Director of National Intelligence has released the national intelligence budget figure for non-military activities. The intelligence community had resisted efforts to reveal the number, arguing that enemies of the United States could learn valuable information by watching trends in spending. The amount designated for military battlefield intelligence had remained classified. Last year, however then-Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair revealed to reporters the total cost for all intelligence gathering was $75 billion, and indicated the amount spent on strictly military intelligence was approximately $25 billion. At the urging of the commission set up to investigate the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Congress passed a law in 2007 mandating public disclosure of the non-military spending number at the end of each fiscal year. Specific details on how much each agency spends and on what remain classified. The current director of national intelligence, James Clapper, had said at his confirmation hearings this past summer that the budgets for both strategic intelligence and military spying should be officially made public. The head of the Senate Intelligence committee said it is time to pare down non-military intelligence spending, which has doubled since the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001. ""Given the nation's financial situation, it is my view that the intelligence budget needs to be carefully reviewed and that cuts will be necessary,"" said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat. The senator indicated there is waste and duplication within the budget and added, ""It is clear that the overall spending on intelligence has blossomed to an unacceptable level in the past decade."" Approximately 100,000 people work on national intelligence, with the majority of employees serving at the big four intelligence agencies: the National Security Agency, the CIA, the National Reconnaissance Office and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. The United States spent $49.8 billion on its national intelligence programs in 2009, $47.5 billion in 2008 and $43.5 billion in 2007, according to the previous reports.","$53.1 billion was spent on non-military intelligence, the administration says .

"(CNN) -- Authorities investigating the disappearance of a 10-year-old North Carolina girl have recovered ""evidence that could provide valuable information"" in the case, police said Thursday. The evidence was located Wednesday, Hickory, North Carolina, police said in a statement, and will be analyzed at the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation's lab. Police launched a search for Zahra Baker October 9, but said no one other than a family member has reported seeing her since September 25, when a woman saw her at a furniture store. Police did not elaborate or say what the evidence is. ""We understand the concern and interest in this case by the public, but we must be cautious in prematurely releasing information, so it will not jeopardize any future criminal proceedings,"" police said. Authorities said earlier this month a bone that might be related to the case was found. They also previously found a prosthetic leg belonging to Zahra, whose disappearance is being investigated as a homicide. Elisa Baker, Zahra's stepmother, is jailed on charges unrelated to the girl's disappearance, as well as an obstruction of justice charge related to the case after she admitted to writing a fake ransom note found at the family's home. Elisa Baker has said said she did not know what happened to Zahra, a freckle-faced girl who lost her leg to bone cancer at age 5 and reportedly developed lung cancer a few years later. Zahra's father, Adam Baker, was arrested late last month in nearby Catawba County on eight charges, including five counts of submitting worthless checks and three counts of failing to appear in court. Police earlier acknowledged that Adam Baker faced bad-check charges unrelated to the disappearance of his daughter. But they did not initially arrest him, as he had been helping authorities in their search. Zahra's biological mother, Emily Dietrich, is coming to North Carolina from Australia, CNN affiliate WSOC reported. She could arrive sometime Thursday. Last week, Dietrich told Australia's Seven Network that she had little hope of seeing Zahra alive again, according to WSOC. Dietrich has not had contact with her daughter since Zahra was an infant. Meanwhile, the Children's Protection Council of Catawba County said it will hold a candlelight vigil in honor of Zahra on Tuesday, her birthday. Toys or stuffed animals left at the vigil will be donated to the Cops for Tots organization, the group said in a statement.","NEW: Biological mother of Zahra Baker arriving from Australia .

"(CNN) -- The Food and Drug Administration is preparing to ban caffeinated alcohol drinks, Sen. Charles Schumer said Tuesday. In response, one leading manufacturer of these drinks announced that it will remove caffiene and other ingredients from its product. The FDA, which has been reviewing the drinks since last year, declined to comment on the report. Spokeswoman Siobhan Delancey said the matter was still under review. But Schumer, in a statement issued to the media, said the FDA will rule that caffeine is an unsafe additive to alcoholic beverages, effectively banning them from the U.S. market. ""Let these rulings serve as a warning to anyone who tried to peddle dangerous and toxic brews to our children. Do it and we will shut you down,"" Schumer, D-New York, said in the statement. Critics say such drinks -- leading brands include Four Loko and Joose -- mix as much as three cups of coffee with three cans of beer and are designed to appeal to younger consumers accustomed to consuming high-caffeine energy drinks. A 23.5-ounce can of Four Loko contains either 6 or 12 percent alcohol by volume, depending on state regulations. What's inside alcoholic energy drinks? The combination of caffeine and alcohol -- which also is found in drinks like rum and cola -- allows drinkers to consume alcohol for a longer period of time without headaches, dry mouth or other unpleasant side effects, according to Kevin Clauson, an associate professor of pharmacy at Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Schumer's office said a recent study found that young drinkers who combine alcohol and caffeine are more likely to be injured, sexually assaulted, drive while drinking and require medical attention than those who drink caffeinate-free drinks. In the latest news, several Washington state college students became ill in October after drinking Four Loko. Phusion Products, the manufacturer of Four Loko, announced Tuesday that it intends to reformulate its drinks to remove caffeine, guarana and taurine from them. From now on, there will only be noncaffeinated versions of Four Loko. ""We have repeatedly contended -- and still believe, as do many people throughout the country -- that the combination of alcohol and caffeine is safe. If it were unsafe, popular drinks like rum and colas or Irish coffees that have been consumed safely and responsibly for years would face the same scrutiny that our products have recently faced,"" the company's co-founders said in a statement. The company also noted that the Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau had approved their products. ""We are taking this step after trying -- unsuccessfully -- to navigate a difficult and politically-charged regulatory environment at both the state and federal levels,"" the statement said. Phusion Products said that over the last several months they wanted to talk with regulators and policymakers in hopes of coming up with standards regulating caffeinated alcoholic beverages. ""By taking this action today, we are again demonstrating leadership, cooperation and responsible corporate citizenship,"" the statement said. If the FDA does move to ban the drinks, it would join New York, Washington, Utah, Michigan and Oklahoma in ejecting the products from store shelves.","Sen.

"(CNN) -- A doctor in Fiji is examining three teenage boys rescued 240 miles from land after they were lost in the South Pacific for more than 50 days. Apunas Sakamuri, spokesman for the police department in Suva, Fiji, said the three were admitted to Suva Public Hospital and then released to a private doctor identified as Dr. Rosemary Mitchell. Filo Filo, 15, and his cousins -- Etueni Nasau, 14, and Samu Pelesa, 15 -- were famished, dehydrated, exhausted and sunburned when a crew member on a fishing boat two miles away spotted their 12-foot metal boat and alerted his superior. The rescue, which came two weeks after hundreds turned out to mourn them, elated their friends and relatives. Tanu Filo, whose 15-year-old son Filo was among the survivors, told CNN Thursday in a telephone interview from his native Tokelau Islands that, ""I was on cloud nine. I was so joyful."" ""I couldn't believe my son and his boys were found again. Unbelievable,"" said Tanu Filo, who noted that a traditional celebration is now in order. ""He alerted us that he saw something immediately on our bow, directly in front of us,"" Tai Fredricsen told CNN Thursday from his 280-foot tuna boat. ""As we drew closer, we could tell that it was a small boat of some type."" The boat was a strange find so far from land. ""It's not something you go in the open ocean with,"" he said, noting that the boat was 240 miles northeast of Fiji when it was spotted late Tuesday afternoon. And it got stranger. Inside were three naked teenage boys -- cousins from the Tokelau Islands 750 nautical miles away. Asked whether they needed help, they said yes. When he learned how long they had been adrift, Fredricsen released his rescue boat, took them aboard his fishing boat, the San Nikunau. ""They looked very bad -- bones protruding from underneath the skin, but mentally strong, strong as an ox,"" Fredricsen said. He moved them to his cabin's king-sized bed, where ""they all fit comfortably,"" and began administering first aid to their burned skin. ""They were ecstatic,"" he said. He also gave them electrolyte-spiked liquids as he had been trained to do in a first-aid class. ""I just gave them very small doses -- they more or less let the drink stay in their mouth and they swirled it around and let it absorb in their cheeks very slowly."" After about half an hour, they were able to swallow, but he urged them to go slowly. ""They knew I was trying to help, and they did what I said. The cooperation was just incredible from the start."" After a couple of hours, they were able to eat small pieces of dry white bread, he said. Four hours later, he was feeding them slices of oranges and apples. ""And then they were starting to get a little bit carried away -- they were wanting some McDonald's or some French fries, but I couldn't allow them to have that yet."" After six hours on board, the three teenage boys began to mingle with the crew. By 4:30 a.m. local time Thursday, they were transferred to a Fiji coast guard vessel, destined for a hospital in Suva on that Pacific island, ""hopefully warm and cozy."" Throughout, the boys were smiling, he said. Natives of the Tokelau Islands -- three small atolls in the Pacific Ocean, about midway between New Zealand and Hawaii -- the boys said they had set out in the boat in early October to travel from one island to another, Fredricsen said. ""The islands are pretty close and they can be transited quite easily with these small vessels,"" but they got disoriented after losing sight of land, ""and that was it,"" he said. The boys said they had left their island with enough coconuts to keep them hydrated for two days, he said. But they used a tarpaulin to catch rainwater and for shelter after their clothes disintegrated. And two weeks ago, they caught a seabird, which they ate, he said. About the same time, authorities had concluded that the teens could not have survived and declared them dead. Two weeks ago, their families and friends held a memorial service attended by 500 people, in the island chain that has a total population of 1,400, according to the Sydney Morning Herald. But their rescue came just in the nick of time. ""They did admit to me they had started drinking salt water two days prior to us rescuing them,"" Fredricsen said. Drinking excess amounts of saltwater can shut down one's kidneys, which can be fatal. The boys were spotted in an ""unusual place"" -- west of the Tokelaus, between western Samoa and Fiji, said Eric Barratt, the managing director for the Sanford seafood company, whose boat found the boys. It was dumb luck that the fishing boat came upon the boys, said Fredricsen, since its usual port of unloading and operations is in American Samoa. ""By chance, we were going to New Zealand to unload"" because the boat was scheduled to be pulled from the water and inspected, a quadrennial event, he said. Fredricsen called the Tokelau Islands and informed Pelesa's grandmother of his unusual catch. ""I just told her we found her kids, and it was total hysteria,"" Fredricsen said. ""It was just amazing."" Pelesa's uncle, Lakia Kalolo, told CNN that Pelesa's grandmother broke the news to him and others. ""You should have seen the village, you should have seen the people here,"" he said. ""They were happy, very happy. Everybody was crying ... We gave thanks to God."" Tanu Filo described a similar scene, with singing and hugging among the villagers when the good news arrived. But when Filo Filo first phoned his father from the boat, ""he cried more than he talked,"" his father Tanu recalled. ""I can tell you that he's tired and all, from the way he speaks,"" Tanu . Filo said. ""But he was so happy."" Fredricsen said the boys left their mark on him and his crewmates -- not only because of what they endured while lost at sea, but because of their attitudes after rescue. ""It was just an uplifting experience to meet these young men,"" Fredricsen said. ""They didn't give up."" Tanu Filo said locals are ""trying to plan a celebration in a Tokelean way."" Besides the boys, he would like the tuna boat's captain and crew to join in the celebratory eating, singing and joy. ""I'd like to say thanks, and shake hands and celebrate ... together,"" Tanu Filo said. ""We want to invite them to the feast."" -- CNN's Salma Abdelaziz and Tom Watkins contributed to this story.","Father of teen calls rescue ""unbelievable,"" invites ship's crew to celebrate .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Two days before Christmas, the alleged smuggler apparently thought Easter eggs would be the perfect ploy to conceal 14 pounds of cocaine. It didn't work. U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers sensed something was a little off with candy for the wrong holiday, a spokeswoman said. ""That's certainly an anomaly, isn't it? They're trained to detect anomalies in all kinds of situations,"" said Lee Harty, a spokeswoman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection. ""It's an unusual concealment method -- at least for this time of year. Maybe not for spring."" Esteban Galtes, 23, of Miami, Florida, was being held without bail being set Monday after he asked a federal court in Los Angeles to continue his Monday hearing until Wednesday, said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman Virginia Kice. Galtes' attorney could not be reached for comment Monday evening. Galtes is accused of smuggling cocaine into Los Angeles International Airport after a week-long trip in Colombia, and he's charged with importation of a controlled substance, which carries a maximum penalty of life in prison, authorities said. Last Thursday night, Galtes' luggage was allegedly found to conceal  more than 14 pounds of cocaine during a search by customs officers, officials said. Much of the cocaine was camouflaged as pastel-colored Easter egg candies, and the remainder of the cocaine was hidden under a cardboard false bottom of a paper shopping bag, authorities said. ""When they inspected the candies and they cut it into them, a white powdery substance was exposed, which tested positive for cocaine,"" Harty said. The cocaine has a street value of more than $100,000, authorities said. ""Drug traffickers are always trying novel ways to conceal their contraband,"" said Claude Arnold, special agent in charge of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations in Los Angeles. ""But cocaine camouflaged as Easter candy is one of the more unusual tactics we've come across. Obviously two days before Christmas, this defendant didn't expect his trip would end with federal officers conducting an Easter egg hunt,"" he said in a statement. Galtes told the officers that the eggs were for his two children, federal authorities said. ""This smuggling attempt and interception should give notice to all persons involved in this illicit trade to think twice when attempting to smuggle cocaine or other prohibited drugs/items into LAX,"" Carlos Martel, acting director of Los Angeles field operations for Customs and Border Protection, said in a statement. Homeland Security investigators are continuing to look into the smuggling operation, officials said.","A smuggler thought Easter eggs would be an ideal way to conceal cocaine .

"(CNN) -- Chelsea's poor Premier League run continued on Sunday as the English champions dropped points for the third match in a row and failed to return to the top of the table. The Londoners were deposed at the summit after Manchester United's 7-1 thrashing of Blackburn on Saturday, but could have returned on goal difference with victory away to mid-table Newcastle. However, Carlo Ancelotti's team could only draw 1-1 as Salomon Kalou earned a point with an equalizer on the stroke of halftime following Andy Carroll's early opener for Newcastle. That gave United a two-point lead after 15 rounds, leaving Chelsea in second place above London rivals Arsenal on goal difference. Berbatov scores five as Man Utd run riot . The match was cleared to go ahead despite the snow that has blanketed the north of Britain in the past few days, with Newcastle's suspension-depleted line-up boosted by the presence of veteran former England defender Sol Campbell for the first time in the league since joining the promoted club in pre-season. The home team -- beaten 5-1 by Bolton last weekend -- took the lead in the sixth minute when recent England debutant Carroll took advantage of a mistake by Brazil defender Alex to score his ninth league goal this season. Alex had a header cleared off the line by Jose Enrique in the 26th minute, and the equalizer finally came as Ivory Coast international Kalou collected a clever pass from Florent Malouda and twisted his way into the penalty area before firing in a deflected shot. Chelsea piled on the pressure in the second half but the closest they came to scoring was when striker Didier Drogba turned and volleyed in off the post in the 77th minute -- but it was ruled out for a blatant handball by the Ivorian. Ancelotti said Chelsea hope to welcome back England internationals John Terry and Frank Lampard from injuries ahead of next weekend's clash with Everton, while Ghana midfielder Michael Essien returns from suspension. ""Next week for Terry and Lampard will be an important week, they will start to train with the team. We have all week to control their condition and I hope that both, maybe more John Terry than Lampard, will be able to play against Everton,"" the Italian told the Chelsea website. ""They are very important, not just as technical players but they have personality, character -- and at this moment we need this kind of player."" Tottenham moved into fifth place above Bolton with a last-gasp 2-1 victory at home to Liverpool as Aaron Lennon scored a stoppage-time winner in the later kickoff. In the second minute of five added on, the England winger beat Liverpool defender Paul Konchesky to Peter Crouch's flick-on and fired past goalkeeper Pepe Reina to put the London club within a point of Manchester City. Liverpool remained on 19 points in 10th place, behind Newcastle on goal difference. Roy Hodgson's team had the best of the first half and took the lead through Martin Skrtel in the 42nd minute when the central defender responded quickest after his header hit the back of teammate David Ngog. Ngog conceded a penalty on the hour mark when he handled Gareth Bale's free-kick, but substitute Jermain Defoe -- who replace the injured Rafael van der Vaart early on -- was wide of the target as the home side missed a fourth spot-kick this season. Five minutes later Skrtel put through his own net to give Tottenham hope, with the Slovakian attempting to deny the lurking Crouch the chance to convert Luka Modric's teasing low cross. England striker Defoe had the ball in the net in the 89th minute, but was in an offside position before volleying in Lennon's header.","English champions Chelsea come from behind to draw 1-1 at Newcastle .

"(CNN) -- Six people, including one minor, were killed Sunday in a natural gas explosion at a resort in Playa del Carmen, Mexico, authorities and state media reported. Another 15 or so were injured, according to the local attorney general's office, with the injured including employees of the hotel and tourists from Canada and the United States. The U.S. State Department said two of those injured were Americans. One of the Canadian victims was a minor, Notimex, Mexico's state news agency reported. Earlier, authorities had said that as many as 20 people could have been injured in the blast. The explosion was likely caused by a buildup of natural gas that somehow ignited, but the official cause is under investigation, the attorney general's office said. Police Commander Arturo Guillermo had said earlier that a gas line or stove exploded at the Grand Riviera Princess. Video from the scene on Mexico's east coast showed debris spilled into a grassy area in front of an area covered by thatched roofs where the restaurant presumably sits. The explosion happened around 9 a.m. Sunday morning in the lobby of the hotel. Emergency personnel responded and transferred the injured people to an area hospital for treatment. ""Right now we have personnel on site,"" said U.S. State Department spokeswoman Gini Staab. The two injured Americans were taken to a hospital, she said. Authorities, including consular agents and a consular officer, were on site at the hotel assisting U.S. citizens staying there, according to Staab.

"London, England (CNN)  -- The pressure of playing for Real Madrid is greater than playing for Manchester United but Cristiano Ronaldo says he has settled into life at his new club. The Portuguese forward's first season in Spain since his world record $130-million move from England has been disrupted by injury. But Ronaldo has thrived on the pitch, scoring 20 goals in 19 appearances. ""It's always complicated when you come from a different league, different football, but I feel very comfortable. The team play nice and they help me a lot,"" Ronaldo told CNN. But the 25-year-old, a former world and European footballer of the year, admitted that the pressure of being a Real Madrid player was more intense than anything he had experienced at Old Trafford. ""Here in Spain, the club have more pressure,"" he said. ""There are many people, more journalists, a lot of pressure."" ""But it's not a problem. I played six years for Manchester and you have to be calm all the time, you have to do what you do, to work and to train hard. I don't care about the pressure.

"Beijing (CNN) -- The ""Party"" is over for one of China's most popular bloggers. Han Han, whose blog has clocked more than 441 million hits in the past five years, announced in his latest post Tuesday that he has shut down his literary magazine ""Party"" after publishing just one issue. The 28-year-old best-selling author of novels and professional race car driver is one of the most recognized faces among Chinese youth. His provocative online commentaries on current affairs have also earned him the accolade as one of Time magazine's 100 most influential people of 2009. Han said the first issue of ""Party,"" launched in July and sold 1.5 million copies. The second issue was due out at end of August. ""Too many people in relevant departments of the Chinese government are capable of turning literary magazines to cultural relics,"" he wrote in his usual sarcastic style. ""If we ever meet, please tell me what went wrong."" At least three things could have gone wrong, according to industry analysts. ""In China, the publication, printing and distribution of reading materials require three different sets of licenses and permits,"" explained Jeremy Goldkorn, founder of the popular China media website Danwei.org. ""So there are three places they can stop you."" Han revealed in the blog the difficulties he repeatedly encountered during his brief magazine-publishing career. He ostensibly denied the magazine's premature death was caused by the state's propaganda czars, who have in the past censored his writings online. The debut issue of ""Party,"" which analysts say had to undergo major cuts to secure government approval, featured novels, essays, poems, photos and cartoons from writers and artists across the Chinese-speaking world, including a serial penned by Han. ""It got an anti-establishment attitude, a kind of rebellious feel to it, but there was nothing explicitly anti-government,"" Goldkorn said. The long delay in the second issue may have prepared Han's fans for the worst-case scenario. Among the thousands of comments left below his latest post, there is sadness, sympathy but little surprise. ""Our great motherland can tolerate so much evil but not a magazine,"" one reader wrote. ""I will hold on to my collector's item (the first issue) and wait for the sun to rise again,"" said another reader. Despite his scathing social commentaries, Han is savvy enough to know the limits of what he can and cannot write about. He famously posted a pair of empty quotation marks in his blog on the day the Norwegian Nobel committee announced its decision to award this year's peace prize to an imprisoned Chinese dissident. As the government blacked out all news coverage on the Nobel announcement, Han's blog went on to attract more than 1.3 million views and some 28,000 comments. His increasing celebrity at home and abroad, however, seemed to have come short in changing his magazine's fate in the country's tightening media environment. ""The structure in place to control the print media is much stricter than that to control the Internet,"" said Goldkorn, the media analyst. ""There will be no loosening up until after the next leadership change in 2012."" ""The Nobel peace prize made everyone in media even less willing to take risks,"" he added. That dampens the prospect of Han resurrecting his ""Party"" anytime soon, despite the hope of many of his admirers. ""I'm not asking or requesting much -- I just hope that all the people in arts, all the literati, painters, and directors can work in an unregulated and uncensored environment,"" Han told CNN in an interview last May. For now, apparently, he is asking too much.","The magzine folds after one issue .

"(CNN) -- One of the most anticipated NBA seasons gets under way Tuesday night. LeBron James' decision to leave the Cleveland Cavaliers to join the Miami Heat and fellow stars Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh, fueled passionate off-season conversation about him and the league. While the focus this season is what will take place on the court, there are financial issues looming for the NBA that many expect will result in a work stoppage next season. CNN spoke to TNT NBA analyst Steve Kerr about the excitement around this week's league openers and the economic clouds looming next season. Below is an edited transcript of that interview. CNN: What should fans expect from LeBron James early in the season? Steve Kerr: They can expect the usual highlight reel play. That's not going to change. But I think fans need to temper their expectations for the team. It takes some time for the team to find its identity and find their roles especially with Dwyane Wade injured for most of the pre-season. I think it's going be fun to watch it all unfold. CNN: So fans shouldn't wonder why the team isn't on pace for 75 wins (teams play 82 games) from day one? Kerr: I get that question a lot since I was on the [NBA record] 72 win team in Chicago [in 1996]. It is pretty unique and I don't think it will ever happen again, but Miami is going to win a ton of games. I don't think anyone will ever win 73 but they will probably be in the 60s, and if things go really well they could be in the high 60s. CNN: James told CNN  that he thought race played a role in the criticism of ""The Decision"" and he recently re-tweeted a racially charged tweet someone sent him. Will this result in people seeing a different side of LeBron James, perhaps not the carefree kid they saw for many years in Cleveland? Kerr: I think this whole thing has to have hardened him and given him a different perspective on people. I think if you combine ""The Decision"" TV show with the fact that he hasn't won a title, he's starting to feel pressure and people maybe don't look at him as the ""boy wonder"" anymore. It's more ""When are you gonna win?"" That brings a lot of pressure, an edge and that comes with the territory and I think he understands that. He has to go out and win a title at some point to validate his legacy. Watch LeBron James' new commercial . CNN: You were a general manager and a player, so you've seen the league's economics from both sides. The NBA is projecting about $350 million in losses this season -- do you think that's an accurate figure? Kerr: Yes. Having been on the management and seeing a lot of numbers both in Phoenix and elsewhere, I think that's an accurate number. CNN: How did it get to that point? Kerr: Rising player costs. The salaries really exploded and you combine that with the downturn in the economy. ... It's been a tough go for most of the teams in the league. It's like a lot of other things in the country: People don't have a lot of spending money and the first thing you cut back on is your entertainment expenses. The other factor is that when the owners bought franchises 30 years ago, they knew they were sitting on a huge franchise value escalation. They bought it for $20 million and they knew it would grow and they could afford to lose some money knowing they could eventually cash in. But now you have a whole group of owners that bought-in at $300-400 million, so owners aren't sitting on that huge payoff at the end that they used to be, so there's a little different mentality on a year-to-year basis. CNN: Is it realistic that player costs can be reduced by 1/3 as the commissioner David Stern says he wants to do? Kerr: I don't think anyone really knows. Usually in these situations, Stern's the master in these negotiations for sure and everything he says is calculated and there's a plan behind it and maybe the plan is go for 1/3 and get 1/4 -- I don't know. He knows what he wants, he knows how to get it, and he also knows that it is a partnership with the players and there has to be compromise and we'll see how it all unfolds. CNN: How hard might the players fight this? Kerr: Having been through it in 1999 (the last NBA lockout) the end result was the players gave up more than the owners did and that's usually the way it works. You have 450 players versus 30 owners and the owners have other businesses, and generally speaking the owners are going to be able to weather the storm easier than the players are. That said, the owners are going to lose a lot of money in a lockout too. I think it's something that'll be resolved but usually the owners come out with the better end of the deal. CNN: What are the odds that there will be a lockout next year? Kerr: I think the odds are pretty good It's impossible to give a number. I think circumstances are very unique, probably more severe than in 1999 because of economic conditions in this country, and the fact that a lot of the owner's other businesses may be struggling a little bit. CNN: What should fans watch for in the early part of the season? Kerr: Can the Lakers stay healthy and motivated? They're trying to get to their fourth straight NBA finals which is very hard to do. Watch Kobe Bryant -- can he sustain it for another full season? Chicago has made a lot of improvement. Orlando is the team that's flying under the radar. Everybody is watching Boston and Miami. Nobody is talking about Orlando. They have the best defensive player in the league, Dwight Howard, and they're going to pose a lot of problems for everybody. CNN: Is Orlando your surprise winner? Kerr: I picked Miami to play the Lakers, with the Lakers winning. But it wouldn't shock me at all if Orlando got to the finals.","Steve Kerr says LeBron James new team should win more than 60 games .

"(CNN) -- China's star hurdler Liu Xiang bounced back from his Olympic Games disappointment to claim his third successive Asian Games gold medal, but Wednesday's action was marred by a second positive drug test by a Uzbekistani athlete. Liu limped out before his first 110-meters hurdles heat in Beijing two years ago, but has since recovered from an Achilles injury and returned to form on home soil with victory in Guangzhou. The 27-year-old headed off teammate Shi Dongpeng in a record time of 13.09 seconds in front of 80,000 people as he bettered the marks he set in winning in Qatar four years ago and South Korea in 2002. ""My coach always has confidence in me. I am confident of myself too. I am quite sure of my form,"" the former world record holder told the Xinhua news agency. ""The Asian Games is important to me, and after that I will focus on the preparation for the 2011 world championships as well as the 2012 London Olympics."" Shi clocked a season's best time of 13.38 while South Korea's Park Taek Yong claimed the bronze medal in 13.48. China also won gold in the women's pole vault as Li Caixia claimed her first Asiad title from teammate Li Ling and Japan's Tomomi Abiko. With three days of competition remaining, China leads with 173 gold medals and 352 in total -- beating its previous record of 342 in Beijing 20 years ago. The nation is also on target to beat its unprecedented 183 titles from that same year. Xu Linyin and Wu Penggen won the men's beach volleyball, the women's hockey team triumphed over South Korea, and He Min earned gold in the men's 1m springboard diving and Wu Minxia in the women's event. South Korea is second on 71 as Kim Deok Hyeon won the men's long jump to become the first male from the republic to win an athletics gold. Japan has 36 golds after Tatsuhiro Yonemitsu's win in men's 66kg freestyle wrestling and Rika Usami's victory in women's karate's individual kata. Iran moved up to fourth on 16 after Ehsan Hadadi won the men's discus and wrestler Jamal Mirzaei claimed victory in the men's 84kg freestyle division. Uzbekistan is 11th on five golds after Yuliya Tarasova won the women's heptathlon, but wrestler Jakhongir Muminov followed judoka Shokir Muminov in testing positive for the banned stimulant methylhexaneamine. Jakhongir failed an out-of-competition doping test on November 19, while Shokir -- who is not related -- lost his silver medal last Friday. The duo joined a growing list of international athletes who have tested positive for the drug, which is generally used as a nasal decongestant.","Liu Xiang wins third successive gold at Asian Games, setting another record time .

"(CNN) -- World heavyweight champion Vitali Klitschko has told CNN he is ready to fight David Haye anywhere. Haye retained his WBA heavyweight crown with a three-round demolition of former Olympic gold medallist Audley Harrison on Saturday, before setting his sights on the Klitschko brothers. Vitali is the current WBC champion while his brother Wladimir holds the IBF, IBO and WBO belts. Haye told CNN on Monday he would fight one of them within a year before retiring and now Vitali has demanded they get it on. He told CNN World Sport: ""I want to show I'm stronger than David Haye. I'm ready to fight, ready to sign the contract, ready to sit at the table and discuss every point. I know the biggest point of David Haye, he wants to make the money. ""I'm ready to give him a very fair proposal. I'm world champion, he is world champion, let's split worldwide income 50-50. I'm ready to fight David Haye anywhere. ""Let's see where the biggest interest is, where the people want to see the fight, where we have good revenue. We're ready to fight in London, Germany, maybe the United States."" Haye was scheduled to fight Wladimir Klitschko in June last year but had to pull out due to injury. Vitali claims Haye has also pulled out of a fight with him, and fully expects it to happen again. ""The explanation is simple,"" he told CNN. ""David Haye is a smart guy, he understands very well, he's a world champion for a long time if he doesn't fight against the Klitschkos. ""We tried to fight him twice and twice he jumped out. Right now, I think it will be exactly the same: before we make negotiations David Haye will find excuses. If he doesn't want to fight, it's his fault."" Haye faced criticism after his one-sided victory over Harrison but denied he needed to fight one of the Klitschkos to improve his credibility. But Vitali accused Haye of becoming world champion ""by talking"" and predicted he would knock the Londoner out if they met in the ring. ""David Haye is fast, he is good technically, but for the heavyweight division he is too light,"" he added. ""Every kilogram, every pound is very important in the heavyweight division. I want to show who is a real heavyweight. ""I'm more than sure if I fought David Haye I would knock him out. I know my skills. Look at my fight record, I knock more people out than anybody. ""His biggest fight was against [Nikolai] Valuev. Valuev was famous for his size, nothing more. He lost so many fights. Who else [has Haye fought]? I fought everyone. I'm ready to fight everyone in the world. ""I want to make an open play so the audience know about our negotiations. No rematch, no options, 50-50 income, it's clear rules.

"(CNN) -- The parents of a Rutgers University student who committed suicide after his roommate and another student allegedly broadcast online his sexual encounter with another man have notified the school they may sue. Jane and Joseph Clementi say the school should have done more to prevent the death of their son, Tyler. On Friday, they notified the university that they were filing a ""notice of claim,"" meant to uphold their right to bring a lawsuit in the coming months, Rutgers spokesman E.J. Miranda said Wednesday. ""Subject to further investigation, it appears that Rutgers University failed to act, failed to put in place and/or failed to implement, and enforce policies and practices that would have prevented or deterred such acts, and that Rutgers failed to act timely and appropriately,"" the notice said. A copy of the notice was provided to CNN by the university. Rutgers university responded to the notice with a statement saying that while it shares ""the family's sense of loss of their son, who was a member of our community,"" it also recognizes ""that a grieving family may question whether someone or some institution could somehow have responsibility for their son's death."" The university is not responsible for his suicide, it said. The body of Tyler Clementi, 18, was recovered from the Hudson River in September, more than a week after he jumped from the George Washington Bridge, which spans the Hudson River separating New York from New Jersey. Clementi jumped from the bridge after two other Rutgers students allegedly used a web camera to capture a sexual encounter between him and another man and streamed it online. Dharun Ravi, 18, who was Clementi's roommate, and Molly Wei, 18, have been charged with invasion of privacy. Their lawyers have asserted their innocence. Last month, Clementi's family consented to the use of his name on a piece of anti-harassment federal legislation known as the ""Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act."" The proposed law would require schools that receive federal student aid ""to create policies prohibiting the harassment of any student,"" said New Jersey Sen. Frank Lautenberg.","Rutgers University student Tyler Clementi committed suicide in September .

"(CNN) -- Five goals from Dimitar Berbatov helped Manchester United move to the top of the English Premier League on Saturday as Alex Ferguson's team thrashed Blackburn Rovers 7-1 at Old Trafford. The home side were 3-0 up within half-an-hour thanks to two goals from Berbatov and one from Ji-Sung Park. Berbatov completed his hat-trick two minutes after the restart and it was Nani's turn two minutes after that, as United went 5-0 up before 50 minutes were on the clock. The Bulgarian striker bagged his fourth in the 62nd minute and eight minutes later fired home an incredible fifth to complete a stunning individual performance. Blackburn did manage a late consolation goal courtesy of Christopher Samba but it couldn't disguise a woeful display from Sam Allardyce's team. Arsenal returned to winning ways after their shock midweek 0-2 defeat to Braga in the Champions League. The Gunners move up to second place in the table -- ahead of Chelsea who play on Sunday -- after a 4-2 victory away to Aston Villa. Andrey Arshavin opened the scoring after 39 minutes before Samir Nasri doubled the lead six minutes later with a well taken volley. A Ciaran Clark goal early in the second half gave the home fans hope that a comeback could be mounted, but Marouane Chamakh poked a shot past Brad Friedel minutes later to restore Arsenal's two goal cushion. Villa halved the deficit once more with 20 minutes to go as Clark scored his second of the match. But Jack Wiltshire made sure of all three points when he headed home in injury time. Manchester City could only manage a point away to Stoke City as they drew 1-1 at the Britannia Stadium. The game looked as though it would end goalless until Micah Richards popped up in the 81st minute to give City the lead. But Stoke's push for an equalizer finally paid off when Matthew Etherington scored in the second minute of added time. Fifth-placed Bolton Wanderers were lucky to get a point in a 2-2 draw against Blackpool at the Reebok Stadium. A 76th minute strike from Martin Petrov and another from England striker Kevin Davies in the 89th minute cancelled out Blackpool's two goals scored by Ian Evatt and Like Varney in either half. Everton's difficulties continued as they were thumped 4-1 at Goodison Park by West Bromwich Albion. The Baggies took the lead after 16 minutes thanks to a Paul Scharner header and Chris Brunt doubled their lead 10 minutes later with a well-struck free-kick. Tim Cahill's header gave Everton hope before the break but Mikel Arteta sending off for a stamp on Chilean defender Gonzalo Jara made Everton's task almost impossible. West Brom duly made the extra man pay with a goal from Somen Tchoyi. Youssouf Mulumbu -- who was later sent off for a second bookable offence -- added a fourth to move Roberto Di Matteo's side up to 11th in the table. West Ham overcame fellow strugglers Wigan 3-1 at Upton Park. Midfielder Valon Behrami opened the scoring for the Hammers after 34 minutes, and goals from Victor Obinna and Scott Parker in the second half sealed the points. Tom Cleverley scored a consolation goal for the visitors four minutes from time. The win means West Ham are now level on points with Wolves who completed a memorable comeback as they beat Sunderland 3-2 at Molineux. Kevin Foley opened the scoring for Mick McCarthy's men after 50 minutes, before Sunderland hit back with two goals from striker's Darren Bent and Danny Welbeck. But back came Wolves with goals from Stephen Hunt in the 81st minute followed by Sylvan Ebanks-Blake who scored the winner a minute before the end. Fulham and Birmingham played out a 1-1 draw at Craven Cottage. Sebastian Larsson gave the visitors the lead after 20 minutes, but Clint Dempsey grabbed a point for Mark Hughes's team with a 53rd minute strike.","Dimitar Berbatov claims five goals as Manchester United thrash Blackburn Rovers 7-1 .

"(CNN)  -- Inter Milan's new coach Leonardo has revealed how he consulted with former Nerazzurri boss Jose Mourinho before deciding to take on the job. The Brazilian has spent much of his playing and coaching career at city rivals AC Milan but after his chat with Mourinho was convinced he was ready to take over from the sacked Rafael Benitez. ""I called him because I don't think you could come to Inter without going through him,"" Leonardo told the Italian club's official website. ""We exchanged ideas on lots of things and I now share his opinions on lots of things. ""He knows everything about this place, because he's still here in spirit -- he left everything here. I'm very happy about what he told me. I rate Mourinho as a true world-beater,"" he added. Football's heroes and villains of 2010 . Mourinho left in late May for Real Madrid after leading Inter to the Champions League, Serie A, Italian Cup treble. Despite Inter's faltering league performances this season under Benitez, Leonardo is convinced that he does not need to make wholesale changes. ""Inter are a ready-made team, there's no need to start over. This side has won everything, but in its own way,"" the 41-year-old former World Cup winner said. ""It has its own identity and the players know what to do, when to play and how to play. My job is to create the right conditions for them to be able to do that well."" Benitez went after complaining, in the aftermath of Inter's Club World Cup triumph, that club president Massimo Moratti had not given him the funds to strengthen his injury-hit squad. Leonardo believes there is enough quality at Inter to repeat last season's successes. ""I've noticed that all the players here, and not only the players, are hugely motivated,"" he said. ""We don't have to invent anything here, just get back to doing the great things that Inter has already shown it can do over the last few years."" Inter go into the second half of the Serie A season 13 points behind leaders AC Milan, but with two games in hand, and into the last 16 of the Champions League where they will play Bayern Munich in a repeat of the 2010 final.","Leonardo reveals he took advice from Jose Mourinho before taking Inter job .

"(CNN) -- The death toll from a shooting at a house party in the violence-plagued Mexican border city of Juarez has climbed to 14, state media reported Sunday. Chihuahua State Attorney General Carlos Manuel Salas told reporters that another 14 people were injured when gunmen attacked the gathering of young people at a house party Friday, the state-run Notimex news agency reported. The victims killed were between ages 14 and 30, Notimex said. Children as young as 7 and 11 were among the injured, the agency reported. Salas said authorities were investigating the backgrounds of all the victims. Mexico's National Human Rights Commission said it was sending representatives to the neighborhood, which was near another home where cartel gunmen stormed a house party in January, killing 15 people. Most of the victims in that shooting were youths who had no ties to organized crime. Investigators said the January shooting was a case of mistaken identity caused by bad intelligence. It sparked widespread outrage in the violent border city, including calls for Mexican President Felipe Calderon to resign. In a news conference Saturday, the country's deputy interior minister told reporters federal authorities will maintain the security strategy they are developing with state officials.

"(InStyle.com) -- In ""Eat, Pray, Love,"" Julia Roberts plays Liz, a globe-trotting, soul-searching writer who spends the better part of a year living out of her suitcase (and who looks great nevertheless). It's the latest in a long line of memorable -- and stylish -- roles for the star. But twenty-plus years in the spotlight have proved that she's no slouch on the red carpet, either: Her simple, classic aesthetic consistently scores high marks. Read on, as InStyle pays tribute to her 10 most memorable looks ever, both on-screen and off. ""Pretty Woman"" Believe it or not, it's been two decades since the premiere of ""Pretty Woman,"" the blockbuster romantic comedy that made Roberts a bona fide star. Even more shocking: Many of the 1990 film's ensembles still look remarkably chic! It's hard to pick a favorite, but we adored the gorgeous red off-the-shoulder gown she wore the night that Edward (Richard Gere) took her to the opera. See all of Julia Roberts's most memorable looks . The Costume Institute Gala She co-hosted the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute Gala in 2008. The theme that year was ""Superheroes: Fashion and Fantasy,"" but the actress wisely steered clear of playing overt homage to Wonder Woman and the like. Instead, she chose a sparkling silver gown from Giorgio Armani Prive that made her look super-gorgeous. ""Erin Brockovich"" Critics -- and fans -- were amazed by Roberts's vulnerable-yet-tough portrayal of a flashy, fed-up single-mom-turned-legal-crusader in 2000's ""Erin Brockovich."" Of course, the wardrobe -- a series of super-short skirts and low-cut tops that the real Brockovich said were still more conservative than her own clothes -- played a crucial role: The push-up bras and big earrings helped the audience to see Erin, not Julia. InStyle.com: See Julia Roberts's 25-year transformation . Academy Awards By the time Roberts was collecting her Oscar for ""Erin Brockovich"" in 2001, she'd ditched the blond hair dye in favor of an utterly classic look: This black-and-white vintage Valentino gown, paired with a smooth updo, made her look like an old-school movie star. ""Duplicity"" Roberts played a CIA-agent-turned-corporate-spy opposite Clive Owen in this 2009 romp. And, of course, she had all the usual accoutrements -- including dark sunglasses and a black trench -- but we loved this romantic V-neck print dress she wore while shooting in Rome, Italy. InStyle.com: Eat, Pray, Love's costume designer dishes . Academy Awards Roberts positively glowed at the 2004 Academy Awards in stunning, champagne-colored Giorgio Armani gown. Like many of the star's red carpet favorites, it managed to be formal yet breezy. As the designer himself said, ""Julia is modern, confident, and extremely attractive. With that one-of-a-kind smile, she captures your heart."" ""Mona Lisa Smile"" Roberts went retro for this 2003 film, which was set exactly half-a-century earlier. She played a free-thinking art history professor at traditional Wellesley college; naturally, then, she accented a simple plaid shirtdress with an offbeat turquoise-studded belt. ""Duplicity"" premiere At the Paris premiere of this 2009 film, Roberts chose a flattering, head-to-toe Lanvin look. The black silk crepe cross-front gown was easygoing yet evening-appropriate, and the super-sparkly crystal-accented pumps added a dose of movie-star glamour. InStyle.com: Julia Roberts's workout--no gym required! ""Ocean's Eleven"" She was bound to stand out in the 2001 remake of ""Ocean's Eleven"" -- after all, Roberts was the only woman in a cast packed with Hollywood's hottest leading men (including George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Matt Damon). And indeed, as a cool Las Vegas art expert, she practically glittered: The elegant updo and sparkling ensemble were, like her character, totally put-together and utterly controlled. ""Notting Hill"" premiere Her role in the 1999 romantic comedy ""Notting Hill"" wasn't exactly a stretch: She played Anna Scott, the biggest movie star in the world. But the vibrant Vivienne Tam sheath that she chose for the film's premiere was slightly out of character for the star.

"Washington (CNN)  -- When President Obama awards the Medal of Honor to Staff Sgt. Sal Giunta on Tuesday, a lot will be made about the fact that he is the first living Medal of Honor recipient since Vietnam. To be exact, Giunta is the first living recipient since President Ford presented Medals of Honor to three heroes of Vietnam on March 4, 1976. The men who received the iconic gold medal on a pale blue ribbon that day -- James Stockdale, George Day and Thomas Norris -- continued to make history after receiving their medals. Refusing to talk . James Stockdale was a Navy pilot and the highest ranking prisoner of war in North Vietnam. ""I believe I had the easiest leadership job in the world: to maintain the organization, resistance and spirit of 10 of the finest men I have ever known,"" Stockdale wrote later in his book ""A Vietnam Experience: Ten Years of Reflection."" While in captivity, Stockdale stabbed himself in the leg to convince his captors he wouldn't talk. After that, the official medal citation says, North Vietnam eased ""employment of excessive harassment and torture toward all of the prisoners of war."" Stockdale went on to become a president of the Naval War College and eventually ran for vice president with Ross Perot. Stockdale died in 2005 and is buried at the Naval Academy. Resisting interrogation . George ""Bud"" Day, an Air Force pilot, was held as a POW for years in North Vietnam, often in the same prison as Stockdale. Day was badly injured when he was shot down and shot later during an escape attempt. Even though he was debilitated, the North Vietnamese subjected him to frequent torture. Years later, during an online chat with viewers of PBS, Day described what his ordeal in the hands of North Vietnamese captors was like. ""They would punish you. They would rope you up or beat you up or torture you in some fashion until you made a response of some kind,"" Day wrote. ""If someone has unrestricted torture ability, there's a lot they can do. They hung people. Stretched your arms out. Broke people's arms. Our population had a 40 percent injury rate. Broken arms. Broken backs. They were a fragile group who could be exploited with a great deal of physical pain. They did that."" According to Day's Medal of Honor citation, his refusal to talk to his captors protected other pilots. ""His personal bravery in the face of deadly enemy pressure was significant in saving the lives of fellow aviators who were still flying against the enemy."" His legal battle with the government over medical benefits for veterans led to a law that guarantees that military retirees and their spouses will have medical benefits for life. Day later became a member of the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, a political group opposed to Sen. John Kerry's presidential candidacy in 2004. He was also an outspoken supporter of Sen. John McCain's 2008 presidential run. Day lives in Florida. Rescuing captured pilot . Thomas Norris was a Navy SEAL. Norris volunteered to go more than a mile into enemy territory to rescue Lt. Col. Iceal ""Gene"" Hambleton, a captured pilot who had valuable information about U.S. missiles and targets that his captors, the North Vietnamese, would want to learn. Norris later learned that 30,000 North Vietnamese and Viet Cong fighters were combing the area for him. ""I was almost constantly in a position where I could have been killed,"" Norris told the Washington Post in 1976. ""The fact that the danger is there is something you don't even worry about."" Norris' rescue of Hambleton is the inspiration for the book and movie ""Bat*21. "" In spite of losing an eye in a later SEAL mission in Vietnam, Norris became an original member of the FBI's elite Hostage Rescue Team. All three were alive when President Ford presented them with the Medal of Honor. Ford awarded a fourth Medal of Honor that day. It was a posthumous medal to U.S. Air Force Captain Lance Sijan, another pilot who endured repeated torture without divulging any information to the North Vietnamese. Righting a wrong . There have been other living Medal of Honor recipients in the years since 1976, but those were retroactive awards. Because of racism during past wars, or because more information about heroics comes to light, the Department of Defense reinvestigates a service member's actions and decides he deserves a Medal of Honor. The latest recipient, Giunta, will receive the award three years after his heroics. He was recommended for a Medal of Honor hours after a bloody ambush and firefight in eastern Afghanistan in 2007. It has taken until now for the medal to be approved. Another Medal of Honor may be awarded relatively soon. CNN has learned that a young Marine from Kentucky, Dakota Meyer, has been recommended for a Medal of Honor for heroics in September 2009 in Afghanistan's Kunar province. His case is now being considered at the highest levels of the Pentagon.","Giunta is the first living recipient since 1976 .

"(CNN) -- Young women at a party attended by about 50 Central Washington University students and other young people were the primary target of spiked drinks, authorities said Saturday. The incident resulted in ""multiple"" reports of overdoses. Some of the victims said they had consumed only one or two beverages before becoming ill, Cle Elum-Roslyn Police Chief Scott Ferguson said. ""Their level of intoxication just didn't seem to make sense,"" he told CNN Radio. Central Washington University students who attended the party told CNN affiliate KOMO on Saturday that they believe a bottle of vodka at the party had been spiked with a date-rape drug known as ""roofies."" They said several people at the party used vodka from the bottle to make mixed drinks. Those who brought their own alcohol, drank beer or didn't drink any alcohol were not affected, the students told KOMO. Ferguson would not comment on the type of drug placed in the beverages. He said he will ask the Washington State Patrol Crime Laboratory to expedite test results. Police do not know who spiked the drinks. ""Whatever occurred up there wasn't consensual,"" Ferguson told CNN. Officers initially responded to an 11:09 p.m. call Friday about a female found unconscious in a vehicle in a grocery store parking lot, Ferguson said. Friends of the victim told authorities to go to a residence in Roslyn, according to a statement from the Cle Elum Police Department. An officer entered one room and took a man into custody who was having sex with a semi-conscious young woman, said Ferguson. Police later determined the woman was the girlfriend of the young man. She exhibited signs of having ingested a spiked drink, Ferguson said, and was taken to the hospital and later released. Her boyfriend was detained and questioned, but not booked. The investigation of that incident -- which authorities described earlier as a ""possible sexual assault"" -- continues, Ferguson said. Several others at the party appeared to be suffering from overdoses at the residence. None of the underage people who overdosed meant to get high or unconscious, said Ferguson, and none had more than one or two drinks, KOMO reported. Rather, he said, they appear to be victims of a scheme to render them unconscious and unable to resist or defend themselves. The woman found in the parking lot remained in the hospital Saturday in stable condition, police said. Twelve people, 11 of them female, initially were taken to hospitals, police said. All except one were released. The party took place at a rental home about 30 minutes from the university campus in Ellensburg, police said. The owner of the home was not at the party, police said. Police interviewed about 35 others who attended the party, which they said was organized by a Central Washington student. The university said it is ""shaken and saddened"" about the incident. ""CWU strictly enforces state law and university policy on underage drinking and illegal drug use,"" it said, adding that freshmen are educated on drug and alcohol abuse and sexual assault. ""Despite our best efforts, however, students sometimes make bad choices,"" the university said. Students identified as being involved with the party will have a conduct hearing that could result in an intensive education course, referral to counselors or suspension, it said. The school will hold information sessions Saturday and Sunday at residence halls, the statement said. Police and schools typically warn young people to be careful about ingesting beverages. ""Roofies,"" a street name for Rohypnol, is a tasteless and odorless drug, Boston University says in a fact sheet on its website, and easily dissolves in beverages. The fact sheet advises students to watch their drinks, avoid punch bowls and not to accept opened beverages. CNN's Barbara Hall, Nick Valencia and Jeremy Ryan contributed to this report.","Central Washington University says students may face discipline .

"(CNN) -- Arsenal's passage through to the knockout stages of the Champions League took a severe knock on Tuesday night as they went down to a shock 0-2 defeat at Braga in Group H. Two late goals from Brazilian striker Matheus mean Arsenal relinquish their place at the top of the table and means Arsene Wenger's team with need to get a result against Partizan Belgrade in their final match. Arsenal will complain that they had a cast iron penalty denied by the officials, when Carlos Vela was brought down in the box in the 80th minute. But the referee didn't see it that way and booked the Mexican striker for diving. Moments later, Matheus evaded Arsenal's offside trap before executing a cool finish over a flailing Fabianski in goal. The Gunners misery was compounded when Matheus broke through again in injury time, weaving through a series of tackles, before firing precisely into the top corner. In the other Group H game Shakhtar Donetsk earned a comfortable 3-0 win over strugglers Partizan Belgrade with second half goals from Stepanenko, Jadson and Eduardo. MSK Zilina threatened to add to Chelsea's recent Premier League woes when they took a shock first half lead at Stamford Bridge in Group F. Babatounde finished off a flowing movement to fire past keeper Ross Turnbull after 19 minutes. They maintained their lead until six minutes into the second half when Daniel Sturridge equalized for the Blues. Florent Malouda sparred any blushes when he scored four minutes from time to maintain Chelsea's 100 percent record in Europe this season. In the group's other game, Marseille inflicted a 3-0 defeat on Spartak Moscow at the Luzhniki Stadium, Moscow. Nicolas Valbuena opened the scoring for the visitors with a pinpoint strike after 18 minutes, while  Loic Remy added a second shortly after the break, dinking the ball over a defender before firing home -- the ball rebounding off both posts before finding the net. A red card for Brazilian striker Welliton in the 65th minute made a Spartak comeback even less likely. And so it proved as Brandao added a third three minutes after Welliton departed. The win moves Marseille up into second place in the group on nine points, which is enough for them to qualify for next year's knockout phase. First half goals from Benzema and Arbeloa were followed by a brace from Cristiano Ronaldo in the second as Real Madrid coasted to an easy 4-0 win over Ajax at the Amsterdam Arena. But Madrid's evening was soured when first Xabi Alonso then Sergio Ramos were sent off for time-wasting late in the game. The win means they maintain their unassailable lead over AC Milan at the top of Group G. The Serie A leaders left it late to secure their place in the knockout stages. Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored his fourth goal in five Champions League games in the 65th minute, followed by an injury time strike from Ronaldinho to beat bottom placed Auxerre 0-2. Roma completed a memorable second half comeback against Bayern Munich in the Stadio Olimpico in Group E. Two goals from Mario Gomez in the 33rd and 39th minutes gave Bayern, who had already qualified before tonight's match, a first-half lead. Roma halved the deficit four minutes into the second half thanks to a goal from striker Marco Borriello, but Roma fans were kept waiting until the 81st minute for the equalizer from De Rossi. Second half substitute Francesco Totti completed the turnaround when he converted an 84th minute penalty to put Roma within touching distance of the knockout phase. In the other Group E game, a 15th minute strike from Federico Almerares was enough to give Basle a 1-0 win over CFR Cluj-Napoca.","A late brace from Braga striker Matheus sinks Arsenal in Portugal .

"Moscow, Russia (CNN) -- Russia has deployed a surface-to-air missile system in the breakaway Georgian territory of Abkhazia, the Russian air force commander said Wednesday. The S-300 system will help ""ensure the security"" of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, another breakaway territory in Georgia, Russian Air Force Commander Col. Alexander Zelin told journalists Wednesday, the Russian Air Force told CNN. It is also designed to protect the Russian military base in Abkhazia, a Russian-backed territory, he said. The systems are intended to ""prevent violations of the state borders in airspace, as well as to destroy any aerial vehicles, regardless of their mission, that cross into the airspace over the protected territories without permission,"" Zelin said, according to the Air Force. Russia and Georgia fought a five-day conflict in 2008 that began when Georgia launched a campaign against South Ossetia. The following day, Russian tanks, troops, and armored vehicles poured into both South Ossetia and Abkhazia and soon advanced into Georgian cities outside the rebel regions. A total of about 850 people were killed on all sides and untold numbers of others were wounded or left missing, a European Union fact-finding mission concluded last year. Russia and Georgia each blamed the other for starting the conflict, though the EU mission said it was rooted in a ""profusion"" of causes. Moscow has since recognized South Ossetia and Abkhazia as independent regions. CNN's Maxim Tkachenko contributed to this report.","Russia deploys a surface-to-air missile system in Abkhazia .

"(CNN) -- Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah has arrived in the United States for medical treatment, the State Department said. ""We hope for his speedy recovery,"" the State Department said in a message from its official Twitter account late Monday. The king left Saudi Arabia earlier Monday for treatment of a herniated spinal disc and a blood clot that was causing him back pain, state media said. Saudi dignitaries met him when he arrived at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, the state-run Saudi Press Agency said. The agency's report did not specify which hospital would be providing treatment to the ruler. ""The medical team recommended that he leaves for the U.S. to visit a spine-specialized medical center in order to complete medical examinations and for follow-up treatment,"" Health Minister Abdullah al-Rabeeah said during an interview Sunday with Saudi state television. ""But I assure everyone that he is in a stable condition, and that he is enjoying health and well-being, and God willing, he will be back safe and sound to lead this proud nation."" Doctors performed tests on the 86-year-old monarch Friday after he complained of back pain, and he underwent more tests Sunday, the Saudi Press Agency reported. His doctors have advised him to rest, but he took calls from Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in which the regional leaders wished him a speedy recovery, the news agency reported. King Abdullah named Crown Prince Sultan to administer the state's affairs in the monarch's absence, the news agency said. The prince was expected to return to Riyadh while the king is overseas, the Saudi Press Agency said. But there are also questions about the crown prince's health: He has lived in Morocco for much of the past year-and-a-half after surgery for an undisclosed ailment in February 2009. The top three figures in the kingdom -- Abdullah, Sultan and Prince Nayef, the country's interior minister and second deputy prime minister -- are all sons of King Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud, who founded modern Saudi Arabia in 1932. Abdullah has ruled the oil-rich kingdom since the August 2005 death of his half-brother, King Fahd. But Abdullah ran most of the kingdom's affairs for a decade before that on behalf of his ailing half-brother. Since coming to power, he has sought to establish rules and procedures for many Saudi institutions, giving him a reputation as a reformer in the highly conservative nation.

"(CNN) -- Ferrari have said they are ""astonished and saddened"" by criticism from Italian politician Roberto Calderoli, after he called for the resignation of their chairman in the wake of Fernando Alonso's failure to secure the Formula One title on Sunday. Calderoli branded the team's strategy as ""demented"" at the season-ending Abu-Dhabi Grand Prix -- as an early pit stop eventually cost Alonso a third world crown -- and put pressure on Luca di Montezemolo to leave the team. ""I'm astonished and saddened by certain statements some politicians and a minister of the Italian Republic made after Sunday's race,"" said the company's vice president Piero Ferrari -- son of the carmakers' founder Enzo -- on Ferrari's official website. ""It has never happened in my entire life at Ferrari that politicians intervened during good and bad moments in our life in motorsport, and I want it to stay like this. ""But if we want to have a look at how much Ferrari has done for Italy's image around the world, then I can only say that it is definitely much more than certain politics have done."" Calderoli accused the legendary team of making a tactical error when they called their Spanish driver in for a pit stop after 15 laps of the race, in an attempt to respond to a similar move from his title-rival Mark Webber. The Italian outfit -- who are a national institution in their homeland  -- watched on as Webber's Red Bull-teammate Sebastian Vettel took the crown, despite being 15 points behind Alonso at the start of the race. ""Ferrari has managed to lose a championship already won,"" Calderoli was reported as saying in British newspaper The Daily Mail. ""We are ashamed of this insane strategy and Di Montezemolo is guilty. He should get out of Maranello [the Italian town which is home to the Ferrari factory] immediately so he does no further harm to Ferrari. By the evening, we expect his resignation."" Di Montezemolo was in defiant mood when he responded to the politician's comments and joined his colleague in highlighting the ""Scuderia's"" contribution to Italy's reputation all over the world. ""When the statesman Calderoli will achieve in his life 1% of what Ferrari has done for this country in terms of industry and sports, then he'll deserve an answer,"" di Montezemolo said. Elsewhere in Formula One, manufacturing giant Toyota announced on Tuesday they have ended their planned association with the Hispania Racing Team (HRT).

"(CNN) -- An American businessman was arrested in Singapore for a series of criminal complaints against him -- not for overstaying his visa as his legal defense team claims, according to a Singapore embassy spokesman. Police who arrested Kamari Charlton on September 1 at the Changi Airport were acting on an Interpol alert that he was wanted on allegations of money laundering and running a phone-scam operation in Australia, said embassy spokesman Siewgay Ong. The fact that Charlton, 37, overstayed his visa was revealed only after he was arrested, he said. Earlier Friday, attorneys for Charlton said he could face three strokes with a cane for overstaying his visa in Singapore. He also could face a six-month jail sentence if convicted, they said. Charlton was about to leave Singapore with his pregnant wife when he was arrested, said Arun Maaran of Charlton's defense team. He's been in jail since. His wife is thought to have returned to the Bahamas, where they live, Maaran said. Contact has been sporadic, because she is thought to have been hospitalized with complications to her pregnancy. Consular officers from the U.S. Embassy have visited Charlton six times, said spokeswoman Rachel Ehrendreich. A statement from police in Singapore on Friday said, ""As investigations are ongoing, no final decision has yet been made on the precise charges"" that may be filed against Charlton. Caning is widely used as punishment in Singapore, but Charlton's case is unique, his defense team argues. His wife was in the country on a six-month medical visa, while he was on a three-month tourist visa. Unlike most offenders who overstay, Maaran said, Charlton was not in Singapore to take advantage of its strong economy by working illegally. He overstayed by 169 days, according to court documents. The former Florida State University college football player now successfully runs a construction company, his legal team says. Charlton's case was to be heard late Friday afternoon to decide whether he has been discriminated against. If he prevails, his case could end up in high court and be resolved within a week or two. But many legal scenarios could play out and the case could drag on, Maaran said. Police denied the claims of discrimination, saying they are ""wholly baseless."" The discrimination argument is based on another case involving overstaying a visa. A cousin of Charlton's wife also overstayed but was allowed to leave Singapore after paying a fine, Maaran said. If convicted, Charlton would be caned unless he could provided a medical reason otherwise. The case is reminiscent of the 1994 case of American teenager Michael Faye, who was sentenced to caning for vandalism in Singapore. After U.S. officials requested leniency, the Singapore government reduced the number of lashes he was given. The U.S. Embassy in Singapore is closely monitoring Charlton's case, Ehrendreich said. ""We remind U.S. citizens that foreigners in any country are subject to the laws of that country,"" she said. ""We respect Singapore's right to try and sentence individuals within due process of law.""

"London, England (CNN) -- Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone took a ""good whacking"" when he and his girlfriend were violently mugged in London, he tells the Daily Express newspaper Saturday. ""I'm feeling it now, bit painful, it was a good whacking,"" Ecclestone told the paper in the only interview he has given so far about the ordeal. The Express carried a picture of Ecclestone with a badly bruised right eye that was purple and swollen. The attack took place Wednesday night outside his offices in London's exclusive Knightsbridge neighborhood, after he had been to a restaurant with girlfriend Fabiana Flosi, the paper reported. The muggers punched the 80-year-old billionaire in the face several times and kicked him in the head as he lay on the ground, he said. They also ripped the earrings off his girlfriend's ears. London's Metropolitan Police confirmed to CNN that a man and woman were robbed of jewelry including two watches and a pair of earrings on Wednesday night. They said officers do not believe the man was targeted because of who he is and that it appeared to be an opportunistic incident."" The man was taken to a hospital for treatment to a minor head injury, the police said. ""I drove as I often do and we had just got out of the car when suddenly these guys laid into me,"" Ecclestone told the paper. ""They said nothing to me, just went on the attack, so there was no chance to feel scared or react. ""When I was on the ground I could hear Fabiana screaming for help and I took a kick or two in the head and went unconscious. ""When I came to there was blood everywhere from my head wound but I was lucky. They weren't worried about taking my eye out or head injuries when they were kicking. ""It was completely stupid and uncalled for. If they had confronted me and asked for everything we had, I would have handed over everything in my pockets, my wallet, anything."" British news reports had said the stolen jewelry was worth several hundred thousand dollars, but Ecclestone denied it, saying, ""They won't be going far on what they took off us."" ""I never carry much money or expensive jewelry,"" he said. ""Most of Fabiana's stuff was just personal from Brazil and not worth much."" The injuries forced Ecclestone to cancel a shooting trip with Spain's King Juan Carlos I this weekend, he said. Police were still searching for the suspects.","Ecclestone tells a British paper he took a ""good whacking""

"(Mashable)  -- Beginning today, Starbucks customers who use the free Wi-Fi at more than 6,800 U.S. company-operated stores will be greeted with the Starbucks Digital Network (SDN) -- an exclusive content network curated by the company and designed to enhance the customer's in-store experience. Starbucks has been teasing SDN for months, but now that the network is about to go live we have a much clearer idea about the type of content provided and the purpose behind the digital endeavor. Starbucks's Vice President of Digital Ventures Adam Brotman sat down with Mashable in advance of the October 20 launch day for a complete tour. ""The vision,"" he says, ""is for Starbucks Digital Network to be a digital version of the community cork board that's in all of our stores."" We've known for some time that SDN would offer unfettered access to The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and USA Today, but that's just scratching the surface. Starbucks has manufactured a rich experience around each of its six channels: News, Entertainment, Wellness, Business and Careers, My Neighborhood and the customer-personalized Starbucks channel. Here's a comprehensive breakdown of each channel: . News: This section of SDN is comprised of Starbucks media partners offering premium or exclusive content to customers. The New York Times has opened up access to its Reader 2.0 subscription-based service for free, all content from the The Wall Street Journal is available minus the paywall and the exact replica of the USA Today newspaper is accessible to users on the network. Newly signed content partner GOOD is providing early access to its infographics, so Starbucks customers can view them before anyone else. Entertainment: Starbucks has populated the entertainment portion of its network with music, apps and books from Apple's iTunes, full access to a selection of books picked by Starbucks and provided by the Bookish Reading Club (via an HTML5 reader), business e-books courtesy of New Word City, a kid-rich experience powered by Nick Jr. Boost and handpicked documentary films provided by SnagFilms. Wellness: Health and fitness publisher Rodale is the primary content provider for this SDN channel. Customers have access to specialized content -- not available to anyone other than Starbucks customers -- from Men's Health, Women's Health, Runner's World, Bicycling, Prevention, Organic Gardening and Eat This, Not That!, along with a custom built ""Map my Ride, Map my Run"" application. Business and Careers: Professional social networking site LinkedIn is making exclusive video and blog content available to WiFi users in this channel. The network also provides LinkedIn job search and suggestions, and offers users a 30-day free trial for the premium account. My Neighborhood: Starbucks is adamant about creating a localized experience to connect customers with the community around the store. The company delivers on this objective by serving up content to users based on the exact whereabouts of the store where the user is accessing the free Wi-Fi. Community fare includes local news from Patch, and a look at nearby DonorsChoose.org classroom projects that could benefit from small contributions. Foursquare users can check in via the web from Starbucks stores, and Zagat makes available full ratings for restaurants in the surrounding area for free. Starbucks: This channel provides a personalized customer experience for Starbucks account/card management, and also amasses all of Starbucks social (Twitter/Facebook/MyStarbucksIdea) and digital properties under one umbrella. We may be kicking a gift horse in the mouth, but one thing that struck us about SDN is that there's almost too much content to go around. In some aspects the experience seems saturated and overwhelming, so customer's may not know where to start and partners providing premium content may find some of it gets overlooked. We broached the subject with Brotman who explained that Starbucks will be tracking user activity via web analytics to get a sense of what users respond to. The network is designed to feel fresh each time you come back and the three promo tiles on the home page rotate to engineer more than 40 unique experiences. It's a priority for Starbucks to ensure that customers have easy access to content, and ""that all the content partners are feeling like they have an equal shot,"" Brotman says. A premium mobile experience . SDN certainly packs in a variety of content that makes for interesting material to explore on a laptop, but the network was also designed with the mobile user in mind. Users accessing the network via mobile devices and tablets will benefit from the HTML5 smartphone-optimized network. SDN for mobile is also touchscreen-friendly, offering a hands-on, swipe-able experience. More than 50% of users logging on to the free Wi-Fi are doing so from mobile devices, so the company was motivated by usage behaviors to build a mobile web experience just as good, if not better than, the standard web experience. Content was also designed to be ""snackable,"" so the mobile user can get value even while waiting in line, says Brotman. Where Yahoo fits in . While SDN is cloaked in the Starbucks brand name, Yahoo actually plays a pivotal role in the behind-the-scenes network experience. Yahoo is the coffee retailer's technology partner on the initiative, so it not only developed the site at Starbucks's behest, but it's hosting the network, powering the search experience and providing content as well. Yahoo will also serve as a promotional partner for SDN, and market SDN on its site in the form of banner ads. The two partners hooked up after Starbucks approached Yahoo about the initiative. ""They're so strong in the three areas we knew we needed help with -- technology, content and search,"" says Brotman, ""so we came to them ... and they were eager."" ""They seemed excited by the local and unique nature of the Starbucks Digital Network,"" explains Brotman on why Yahoo was eager to work with the trendy coffee retailer. The bottom line is choice . One would assume, correctly so, that Starbucks has not gone to trouble of providing free Wi-Fi and a premium digital network without thinking about how it could profit by these pricey additions. If we didn't know better, we'd presume that Starbucks was charging its partners for placement. Instead, as we've disclosed before, there's no money changing hands -- unless SDN users make purchases from partners, in which case there is a revenue share. What it comes down is a matter of choice. Coffee and tea drinkers have a myriad of options, so for Starbucks it's about motivating the customer to choose its stores, and its digital network content partners by association. SDN is designed with two key objectives in mind, says Brotman: enhancing the customer's experience and better engaging customers while they're in the store. ""Tens of millions of customers are coming in to our stores and logging in to our WiFI on a monthly basis anyways. They're coming in because we provide this great experience -- good music overhead, quality food and coffee and the opportunity to connect with your friends or the baristas ... What we hope is that this is a nice complement to that experience."" The engagement piece is centered around what Starbucks can do with location, and perhaps reveals a bit more about Yahoo's motivation to participate. ""We're really excited about the fact that we can leverage the location-based nature of the site to connect our customers with the communities around the stores,"" he says. © 2010 MASHABLE.com.

"(CNN) -- The Argentine government continued to sound the alarm Monday about British plans to conduct military exercises on the Falkland Islands. The Argentine ambassador to the United Nations, Jorge Arguello, said Argentina plans to alert U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to the British military exercises, which Argentine President Cristina Kirchner has condemned as ""grave, very grave."" The ambassador said the Argentine mission also planned to ask Ban for U.N. help in negotiations between Argentina and the United Kingdom. The British Foreign Office, meanwhile, downplayed the exercises. ""These are routine military tests that have taken place every six months for the past 28 years, most recently in April this year,"" an office spokesman said. ""Shipping alerts are always issued in advance and the tests take place entirely within Falklands territorial waters."" The disputed Falkland Islands, known as the Malvinas in Argentina, lie off the South American country's coast in the South Atlantic. The islands have been under British rule since 1833. Argentina invaded the Falklands in 1982, prompting a war in which more than 600 Argentinean and 255 British military personnel died. Britain retained control of the islands after the war. Kirchner has used her Twitter account to sharply criticize the exercises. She tweeted that she considers it ""grave, very grave"" that the Royal Navy plans to go forward with the exercises, referring to the military as ""colonial occupiers of the Malvina Islands."" Britain keeps a military presence on the islands, and the Falkland Islands government -- representing a population of about 2,500 -- says it remains committed to British sovereignty. The British military issued a communique Friday announcing it would be firing missiles from the islands. Kirchner called the exercises ""the militarization of the South Atlantic and the illegitimate and reckless use of the U.N. Security Council's permanent seat."" On Saturday, the Argentine Foreign Ministry voiced the government's opposition to the exercises. The ministry said in a statement that the Argentine government expressed ""its most formal and energetic protests against wanting to go ahead with this military exercise and demands that the British government abstains from going through with this."" CNN's Joe Vaccarello contributed to this report.","President Cristina Kirchner calls plans by UK military ""grave, very grave""

"(CNN)  -- A paramedic accused of plotting to extort $25 million from actor John Travolta after his 16-year-old son died in the Bahamas told a jury Wednesday the boy had been dead for some time before the ambulance service was called. John Travolta's 16-year-old son, Jett, died in the Bahamas in January after having a seizure. Tarino Lightbourn said in his statement to the Nassau, Bahamas, jury that a doctor told medics to keep administering cardiopulmonary resuscitation on Jett Travolta despite knowing the teen was dead, and that the ambulance company was told to transport him to the hospital -- something not usually done if a person was already dead. Lightbourn and former Bahamian Sen. Pleasant Bridgewater are on trial on charges they attempted to extort money from Travolta after his son's January 2 death from a seizure. In Bahamian courts, defendants are allowed to make a statement without being placed under oath and will not face cross-examination. Earlier in the trial, Travolta testified that his son was found unresponsive by a nanny at the home on the island of Grand Bahama, where the family was spending the New Year's holiday. Lightbourn said Jett Travolta's veins had collapsed and his body was stiff as he lay on the bathroom floor. Someone in the room suggested that those present would receive a lot of money if they stayed quiet, he said, adding he thought this was part of a cover-up. Lightbourn did not say to whom he was referring. Travolta testified he initially told the ambulance driver to rush them to an airport where his private jet was parked and where Travolta, who is a pilot, planned to fly his son to a West Palm Beach, Florida, hospital instead of driving him to one in nearby Freeport. The paramedic, however, asked Travolta to sign a statement releasing the ambulance company from liability. ""I received a liability of release document. I signed it. I did not read it. Time was of the essence,"" Travolta testified earlier in the trial. While he and his wife were riding in the ambulance with their son, they decided to divert to the hospital. At the hospital, the actor was told his son ""wasn't alive,"" he said. In her statement, Bridgewater said she advised Lightbourn not to sell the document because she was trying to protect the Travoltas and the Bahamas. She said she was concerned Travolta would tell his friends not to travel to the Bahamas because of the lack of privacy. Lightbourn said Wednesday that he asked attorney Bridgewater to assist him in negotiations with Travolta's attorneys. Travolta earlier testified he learned of a demand for $25 million, or ""stories connected to that document would be sold to the press ... The stories would imply the death of my son was intentional and I was culpable somehow."" Travolta attorney Michael McDermott testified that he assisted police in a sting by secretly recording meeting with the defendants in a Nassau hotel room. Bahamian police had placed wireless microphones on McDermott and hidden two cameras in his room, McDermott said. Lightbourn said his eyes popped when Travolta's attorney offered him $15 million for the document Travolta signed. Travolta's attorney testified the negotiations between Lightbourn and himself were all part of the Bahamian police sting. On Wednesday, Travolta attorney Michael Ossi told CNN he could not comment on specifics in the case. ""The statements made today are not evidence, but what has already been placed into evidence speaks for itself,"" he said. Defense attorneys have attempted to convince the jury that Travolta's attorney came to the Bahamas to ""set up"" their clients. Murrio Ducille, who represents Bridgewater, said to Travolta's attorney, ""you came to the island with evil in your heart."" The trial is expected to wrap up early next week when the jury will begin its deliberations. Travolta and his wife, actress Kelly Preston, are not expected back in court. Journalist Arthia Nixon in Nassau, Bahamas, contributed to this report.","Paramedic on trial, accused of plotting to extort $25 million from John Travolta .

"(CNN) -- Two Mississippi sisters who have spent 16 years in prison over an $11 armed robbery will be released with an unusual stipulation: One must donate a kidney to the other. Gov. Haley Barbour, who suspended their sentences, said Wednesday that Gladys Scott, 36, must donate a kidney to her sister, Jamie, 38. Each of the Scott sisters got two life sentences after they were convicted by a jury of robbing two people near the town of Forest. Although they would be eligible for parole in 2014, the Department of Corrections ""believes the sisters no longer pose a threat to society"" and their incarceration is no longer necessary for rehabilitation, Barbour said in a statement. Jamie Scott's kidney dialysis treatment creates a substantial cost to the state, said Barbour. Mississippi Corrections Commissioner Christopher B. Epps, who agreed with the decision to suspend the sentences, said Jamie Scott's three-times-a-week dialysis costs the state about $190,000 a year. The Scotts' attorney, Chokwe Lumumba, said Gladys Scott previously offered to make the kidney donation. The announcement pleased the NAACP and other civil rights advocates, who have pressed for the sisters' release in rallies and at other forums. ""We need more days like this in Mississippi,"" NAACP President Benjamin Jealous said at a news conference Thursday at the State Capitol building in Jackson. ""We need more days like this in our country."" Jealous said he hoped Barbour's decision served notice to governors in other states where incarcerations are being challenged ""that they have a big role to play in advancing justice."" Lumumba praised the decision but said he believed it was the medical situation that brought the sisters' story to the media's attention, rather than the injustice of their conviction. He said he hoped this case would bring further attention to ""the story of a lot our people who are in jail who ought not be."" ""It was bad when they were convicted in the first place,"" the attorney said of the Scotts. ""It was bad when they were sentenced to two life terms (for a crime) for which most people wouldn't serve a day in jail for."" Lumumba said that while he believes Barbour suspended the sentences ""for political reasons,"" he said the act nonetheless ""bespoke a sense of humanity"" and thanked him for doing it. Lumumba contends the sisters were not involved in the robbery and that there were discrepancies in testimony. The convictions and sentences were upheld in 1996 by the Mississippi Court of Appeals. In 1993, Gladys and Jamie Scott were arrested and charged with leading two men into an ambush in Scott County, according to CNN affiliate WLBT. Court records show the men were robbed by three teenagers who hit them with a shotgun and took their wallets. According to The Clarion-Ledger, in Jackson, Mississippi, the sisters had pleaded not guilty as accessories but were convicted of armed robbery, while the three accomplices received lesser sentences and since have been released. ""Regardless of what you think of the convictions, they have served more time than they should have served,"" Lumumba said. Both of the sisters say they would like to go to Florida to be with their mother and their children, but details must be worked out by corrections officials, Lumumba said. They are housed in different parts of a prison in Pearl, just outside Jackson. Their mother, Evelyn Rasco, said Thursday she was driving when she got the news. ""I just went hysterical. I had to stop the car,"" she said. ""I got so emotional, thanking God that finally this has come to an end."" It was not clear when the release may occur. Lumumba told CNN it may take about seven days, but Epps said it will be closer to 45 days. Mississippi officials will work with counterparts in Florida to ensure certain conditions are met, said Epps, adding the women would then have to report to a Florida probation and parole officer. Barbour said the state Parole Board reviewed the sisters' request for a pardon and ""recommended that I neither pardon them, nor commute their sentence. ""At my request, the Parole Board subsequently reviewed whether the sisters should be granted an indefinite suspension of sentence, which is tantamount to parole, and have concurred with my decision to suspend their sentences indefinitely."" The kidney donation ""should be scheduled with urgency,"" Barbour said. Lumumba, who called the situation a human rights case, said the dialysis equipment at the prison was sometimes faulty and infections were an issue. But Epps said ""we have provided quality care"" and complications in dialysis sometimes occur. The state spent about $50 million in inmate medical care in 2010, he said. Neither of the Scott sisters had a previous record, Lumumba said. Epps said each have some rules violations reports while serving in prison, but not for anything serious. Two Democratic Mississippi lawmakers who were involved in the case -- state Sen. John Horhn and state Rep. George Flaggs -- told CNN affiliate WLBT that Barbour deserves credit for suspending the sentences. The governor ""brought closure to this issue,"" Flaggs said. Lumumba, who said he will press later for pardons, communicated Wednesday evening with Gladys Scott. ""She was just thrilled, and also happy for her sister."" CNN's Martin Savidge contributed to this report.","NEW: Mother was driving and stopped car when she got the news .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- A strong storm system made driving dangerous in the Rockies and the upper Plains and contributed to a pileup involving about 100 vehicles Thursday near Fargo, North Dakota, officials said. ""It is not fit for anyone to be out there,"" North Dakota State Highway Patrol Capt. Eldon Mehrer told CNN radio. Snow, ice and rain plagued much of the West, and North Dakota officials closed Interstate I-94 between Jamestown and Fargo and the north-south Interstate 29 from the Canadian border to South Dakota. The I-94 chain-reaction wreck a few miles west of Fargo occurred when two semi trucks jackknifed in the treacherous conditions, Some 100 vehicles were affected by the mishap, with about 30 involved in crashes. One person was critically injured amid four injury incidents, Mehrer said. Clearing the accident was difficult, said the patrol officer, who had a simple message to motorists: stay home. Across much of the state, rescuers gave up trying to get vehicles out of ditches and concentrated on picking up stranded motorists using snowmobiles and buses. In California, acting Gov. Abel Maldonado declared a state of emergency for Mariposa County Thursday because of extreme weather and storm conditions. The central California community becomes the 12th California county declared to be in a state of emergency because of this month's punishing rain and windstorms. The others are Kern, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Luis Obispo, Tulare, Kings, Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, Inyo and San Diego counties. Officials in Mariposa County, which describes itself as the home to Yosemite National Park, had earlier declared a local emergency, Maldonado said in the proclamation. This month's winter storms have been so punishing that the flood damage to homes, businesses and roads require ""the combined forces"" of state and regional aid for providing relief, the proclamation said. Maldonado is serving as the chief executive while Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger is away from the state on vacation. Meanwhile, a missing snowboarder who had been enjoying the fresh snow was found dead Thursday morning in the Alpine Meadows ski resort in Tahoe City, California, said resort spokeswoman Rachael Woods. Shawnte Willis, 25, of Tahoma, California, had been missing since Tuesday when snowboarding with friends, and her body was found in a tree well about 400 feet below the Pacific Crest Trail in the Granite Chief Wilderness Area by search and rescue team supervised by the Placer County Sheriff's Department. A series of Pacific storms have created the wettest December ever throughout southern California, according to National Weather Service recording stations in Los Angeles, Long Beach, Camarillo, Santa Barbara and Santa Maria. Arizona was rebounding Thursday from the storm, with I-17 and I-40 open in both directions. Crews were using de-icers to keep them safe, officials said. ""We think we passed the worst of it,"" said Department of Transportation spokesman Timothy Tait, indicating clear skies Friday will help after a frosty overnight. iReport: Share photos, video of winter weather and traffic . Snow, ice and low visibility snarled traffic, and parked cars made it difficult for some of the nearly 300 state snowplows to do their work, Tait said. Suburbs of Phoenix reported flurries. U.S.180 remained closed north of Flagstaff, and 89A between Sedona and Flagstaff was mostly out of commission. This week's storms were also ""a contributing factor"" in the death of a 70-year-old woman in a northern California exotic wildlife preserve, authorities said Wednesday. The woman was reading a bedtime story to her 7-year-old granddaughter Tuesday night when an oak fell on their safari-style luxury tent in Santa Rosa. The grandmother was killed instantly, authorities said, but the child was unharmed. ""Obviously, the weather was a contributing factor to this tragedy,"" said Cyndi Foreman, a spokeswoman for the Rincon Valley Fire Protection District in Santa Rosa. ""It was heavy rain in a short period of time and heavy winds and back-to-back storms."" The death occurred as a strong and cold storm system from the Gulf of Alaska moved into the West. Ice was causing headaches in Arizona and the National Weather Service said additional rains, heavy snow and winds would make the going rough over the next several days for residents in much of the region. Weather specialist Stuart Seto said this week's rainstorms, pushed by a cold front out of the Gulf of Alaska, didn't produce major debris or mudslides on Tuesday or Wednesday. ""It was a fast-moving storm, so we were lucky. No major debris flows (but) there were some little ones,"" Seto said. The Alaskan front brought low temperatures to southern California Thursday and is expected to bring freezing temperatures to the Los Angeles suburb of Woodland Hills, which could see 31 degrees Friday morning, Seto said. The record low for that day was set in 1972 at 27 degrees, Seto said. In New York, snowbound residents said their streets remained clogged days after a massive holiday blizzard. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said Thursday he will investigate whether sanitation workers intentionally delayed cleanup efforts over frustrations regarding citywide budget cuts. The slow cleanup effort hampered morning commuters, delayed first responders and even prevented aircraft service personnel from reaching airports where 29 international flights were stuck on the tarmac for more than three hours, officials said. CNN's Paul Vercammen and Phil Gast and CNN Radio's Barbara Hall contributed to this report.","NEW: 100 vehicles involved in North Dakota incident .

"(Mashable)  -- Facebook is rolling out a new breed of Pages called Friendship Pages that pull together the public wall posts, comments, photos (based on tags) and events that two friends have in common. The Friendship Pages feature was cooked up by Facebook software engineer Wayne Kao and then brought to life in an internal hackathon event. The Pages are designed to the tell the story of two friends on Facebook through their shared activity. ""For those of us who have worked on it, the best part is the human side of these Pages. They can bring back memories, conversations and times spent together,"" explains Kao. Friendship Pages are accessible from under the main photo on a friend's profile Page and via links from related wall posts or relationship stories. The Pages are public to other members so long as they have permission to view both users' profiles. Friendship Pages are said to be launching today, but are likely being delivered to members in a gradual rollout. We think the Pages are an interesting alternative way to organize Facebook activity around friends, though it does add another layer of complexity to the site. © 2010 MASHABLE.com.

"(CNN) -- Thirteen townships in Australia's flooded Queensland state were evacuated Thursday as forecasters warned it may be weeks before river levels start to drop. All 130 residents of Condamine, about 185 miles inland from Brisbane, were evacuated because the town was inundated with water, Queensland Emergency Services Minister Neil Roberts told CNN. He said it was one of 13 townships where residents had to be moved out Thursday. In all, between 1,000 and 2,000 people have been evacuated, he said. Roberts was in Emerald, an inland city of 15,000 residents that was experiencing some of the worst flooding Thursday. The Fitzroy River there was rising and expected to peak Friday at a record level of 16.2 meters (53.2 feet), according to Jeff Perkins, a supervising hydrologist at Australia's Bureau of Meteorology. ""Emerald is downstream of Fairbairn Dam. We're expecting the dam to peak overnight tonight and Emerald to peak tomorrow,"" Perkins told CNN. Rockhampton, a coastal city of 50,000 that is also affected by the Fitzroy River, was expected to see its worst flooding in 50 years next week, Perkins said. ""It's going to be a big flood over next week, up to about 9.4 meters (30.8 feet), which will be similar to the 1954 flood,"" Perkins said. Many areas around the Fitzroy River will still be at flood stage in 10-14 days' time, he said. Elsewhere in Queensland, Australia's northeast state, it was a mixed picture. The town of Bundaberg peaked Thursday at 7.92 meters (26 feet), Perkins said. That level was expected to stay steady throughout the day but start to fall Friday, he said. Parts of northern Queensland, however, were starting to recover from the monsoon rains that started about a week ago, creating the flooding problems, Perkins said. The rainfall has since moved south, flooding southern parts of the state, including Emerald and Rockhampton. Over the entire month of December, Queensland has seen 1.3 meters (4.3 feet) of rain -- most of which fell during the past four or five days, said Tony Auden, a forecaster with the Bureau of Meteorology. ""There's been numerous rainfall records both for individual days and for much of the year, and for the month as well for northern and eastern Queensland,"" Auden told CNN. The rain is now easing, but it has left behind flooded rivers that continue to cause the problems, he said. Eight areas of the state have been declared disaster situations, Queensland Premier Anna Bligh said. She said the flooding was the worst she's ever seen. ""What is unprecedented about what's happening up here at the moment is just the scale and the number of communities affected,"" she said in an interview Thursday with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. ""I've certainly seen flooded towns before in Queensland. We have big storms and we have big river systems. But I've never seen Queensland -- and I think it's without precedent in our recorded history -- with so many places in so many diverse parts of the state each affected so critically all at once."" The government of Queensland said additional police have been sent to many flood-affected areas including Emerald, Rockhampton and Bundaberg. It asked drivers to be careful when driving over the New Year holiday throughout the state. More than 100,000 liters (26,400 gallons) of water was being trucked into the town of flooded town of Dalby on Thursday because it was left with only two days' worth of drinking water supply, Roberts' office said. ""This is a proactive measure, initiated before the stocks were exhausted,"" Roberts said in a statement. ""The emergency was caused by the town's water treatment plant being out of action after flood inundation."" Thirty-one of Queensland's 73 communities are now receiving government disaster assistance, Prime Minister Julia Gillard's office announced this week. Acting Attorney General Brendan O'Connor said the government would continue to monitor the situation in disaster-declared areas across Australia and work with state authorities to provide more assistance.","13 townships are evacuated Thursday .

"(CNN) -- NASA engineers will repair small cracks found on the space shuttle Discovery's external fuel tank -- a development that could further delay its launch. ""The X-rays showed four additional small cracks on three stringers on the opposite side of the tank from Discovery, and managers elected to repair those cracks ..."" NASA said in a statement. The work is expected to take two to three days. Additional repairs may be needed, NASA said. The cracks on support beams called ""stringers"" showed up during the latest round of image scans that NASA has been conducting to determine when the shuttle can take off, the space agency said Thursday. The earliest possible launch date is February 3, according to the agency. Earlier cracks found in the foam covering the fuel tank have repeatedly delayed the shuttle's final launch, originally scheduled for November 1. Technicians repaired the cracks and reapplied foam insulation on aluminum brackets on the tank in November. The foam cracked while the tank was being filled November 5 for the shuttle's planned launch to the International Space Station. Discovery is scheduled to deliver a storage module, a science rig and spare parts to the orbiting facility. The delay means the final launch of Endeavour, which is also scheduled to be the last launch of the space shuttle program, is likely to be delayed until April 1, said Bill Gerstenmaier, associate administrator for space operations.","Cracks found in the foam covering the tank have caused delays .

"(CNN) -- Spanish champions Barcelona will kick off 2011 without the services of world player of the year Lionel Messi and key defenders Carles Puyol and Gerard Pique. Coach Pep Guardiola has given top scorer Messi permission to miss Sunday's home clash with Levante as his side seek to move five points clear of second-placed rivals Real Madrid in the La Liga standings. The club's website reported on Friday that the Argentina forward had been allowed to extend his holiday, so will be missing from the line-up for only the fourth time this season. Captain Puyol is ruled out with a groin injury that he picked up playing for Catalonia in the representative game against Honduras earlier this month, and may also miss next weekend's trip to Deportivo La Coruna.

His central defensive partner Pique is suspended after picking up his fifth yellow card this season in Barca's final league game of 2010, the 5-1 thrashing of city rivals Espanyol on December 18. However, Guardiola will be able to call on Argentine defender Gabriel Milito and young midfielder Jeffren Suarez, who have both returned to training. Milito had been sidelined since injuring his thigh in the Spanish Cup win over Ceuta on November 10, while the 22-year-old Jeffren suffered a groin problem in the Champions League match win over Rubin Kazan on December 7. Football's best and worst of 2010 . Meanwhile, Jose Mourinho's Real Madrid will return to action on Monday with a trip to seventh-placed Getafe. The capital club's website reported that 5,000 fans turned up to watch the squad return to training on Thursday. ""I had never been in a session attended by so many people,"" Real's former Getafe winger Pedro Leon said. ""We thank the fans for their support and we ask them to continue supporting us. I hope we can thank them by winning a title at the end of the campaign."" Spain's top two clubs will also line up in midweek for the second leg of the Spanish Cup last-16 ties, with Barca away to Athletic Bilbao and Real traveling to Levante. Bilbao will be hoping to pull off a shock after earning a 0-0 draw at Camp Nou this month, but Levante have little chance of overturning an 8-0 first-leg deficit.","Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola allows Lionel Messi to extend his winter break .

"(CNN) -- The electronic component visible in a law enforcement image of an intercepted suspicious shipment from Yemen appears to be a printed circuit board from a disassembled cell phone, an engineer told CNN Friday. ""This size and the shape of the PCB (printed circuit board) are typical to a handset cell phone type device,"" wrote Olivier Clerc, hardware application engineering manager for a large U.S.-based cell phone parts manufacturer. Clerc prepared the e-mailed analysis of the image at CNN's request. His analysis was supported by information from a source close to the investigation into two U.S.-bound suspicious packages, who said the devices appear to be designed to be detonated by a cell phone. Cell phones have been widely used by terrorist groups as a means of triggering bombs. ""The component on the top right part of the device seems to be a digital camera sensor,"" Clerc wrote in his analysis. ""The area with a rectangular grey material [held] a display that was removed."" ""On the left of the device, under the two metallic shield cans are most likely the baseband processor or the display controller."" A baseband processor is critical to the function of a digital cell phone. ""There is as well a coin type cell (which) is a backup battery, and 2 Board to board connectors. On one of these connectors is plugged a keypad that was as well removed. Another metallic component on the top left of the electronic board (partly hidden under a screw) seems to be a small vibration component, used on cell phones (when vibrate mode is enabled). So this board is very likely to be the main electronic board of a cell phone device."" The source close to the investigation said a highly explosive compound known as PETN was found in both devices in amounts large enough to trigger a powerful blast. PETN was allegedly one of the components of the bomb concealed by Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, the Nigerian man accused of trying to set off an explosion aboard Northwest Airlines Flight 253 as it approached Detroit, Michigan, on December 25. AbdulMutallab is alleged to have been carrying 80 grams of PETN in that botched attack. By comparison, the source said the two devices found in the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates on Friday contained multiple times more PETN. Just six grams of the material is enough to blow a hole in the fuselage of an aircraft. A Google search for the numbered markings on the printed circuit board produced several links to the Bird D736 mobile phone. The D736 is a similar shape to the circuit board. The D736 is a Chinese-brand GSM two-band phone that allows the unit to work in most countries in the world, including the United States. Clerc cautioned, however, that ""it was not obvious that this board is the D736 phone."" In the law enforcement photo, the cell phone circuit board is crudely mounted with screws, metal and plastic fragments to what appears to be a stout metal case. Wires lead from the circuit board out of the frame. Sources familiar with the investigation tell CNN that the suspicious shipments from Yemen contained computer printers. The metal case on which the circuit board is mounted would be consistent with the frame of a laser printer. Law enforcement sources have also told CNN that explosives were packed in printer toner cartridges. A U.S. official says while the explosive was likely the highly volatile PETN, testing is ongoing. CNN's Pam Benson, John Cunha and Paul Cruickshank contributed to this report.","NEW: Source: Devices in packages appear to be designed to be detonated by a cell phone .

"(CNN) -- A Texas distributor has expanded a recall already involving thousands of cases of produce over fears of salmonella cross-contamination in its processing facility, the company said. The case is one of two apparently unrelated outbreaks that have sickened nearly 100 people in the United States and Canada. J&D Produce, Inc. had previously announced the recall of nearly 7,000 cases of cilantro and curly parsley after samples in Quebec, Canada, and Michigan tested positive for the bacteria, the company said Monday. The ""precautionary, voluntary recall"" pertains to cilantro and parsley packed between November 30 and December 6, the Edinburg, Texas-based company said in a statement. The produce was processed and branded as Little Bear between those dates can be taken to retailers for a full refund. The company is also recalling 19 other types of produce that were run on the same packing lines, because the salmonella may have spread to those products as well. ""It's imperative to protect public health, even if that means being overzealous in expanding the scope of the products we're calling back,"" said James Bassetti, president of J&D Produce. ""We will work closely with regulators, health officials and our customers in bringing back the products."" No one has reported getting sick from eating the vegetables, according to J&D Produce. The recall came after independent tests found salmonella on the company's parsley in Quebec and its cilantro in Detroit, Michigan. The company's products are sold retail as well as to wholesalers, who may then distribute them to restaurants and other establishments, according to Sharon McNerney, a public relations consultant for the company. The recall involves 2,498 cases of the parsley -- which have expiration dates 12 days after being packed -- that went out to the Canadian provinces of Quebec and Ontario and the U.S. states of Connecticut, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin. The 4,411 recalled cases of cilantro, carrying the same packing and expiration dates, were distributed in Colorado, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin as well as Quebec and Ontario. A complete listing of the other recalled produce will be available on the company's website. After the positive results, regulators and health officials in the United States and Canada have stepped up inspections of J&D Produce's facilities, Bassetti said. They also undertook other measures, including stopping and sanitizing all production lines, adding manual inspections, rinsing products more and bringing in consultants. ""We have a good track record, but we'll bring our expectations and standards to even higher levels,"" he said. ""We've already begun improving our systems."" In addition to cilantro and parsley, the Texas company gathers, packs and distributes a variety of fruits and vegetables such as carrots, limes, eggplants, peppers, greens, onions, melons, mangoes and asparagus, according to its website. A separate salmonella outbreak linked to alfalfa sprouts has sickened some 94 people in 16 states and the District of Columbia, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Tuesday. Health officials said those first cases became known November 1, with many getting ill after eating alfalfa sprouts in products from Jimmy John's Gourmet Sandwiches outlets. The Food and Drug Administration said Monday that those vegetables came from Tiny Greens Organic Farm. Tiny Green's alfalfa sprouts and spicy sprouts, which have alfalfa sprouts plus radish and clover sprouts, were distributed in 4-ounce and 5-pound containers to farmers' markets, grocery stores and restaurants including Jimmy John's. In addition to a variety of sprouts, the Urbana, Illinois, produce company distributes arugula, broccoli, fennel, cauliflower, onion, radish and other items, according to its website. The FDA said consumers shouldn't eat the sprouts and restaurants shouldn't serve them. They should instead be thrown away, the agency said. In a letter to Jimmy John's franchisees, founder Jimmy John Liautaud said that the chain had pulled sprouts from all its Illinois establishments after store locations came up negative for the bacteria. About 24% of those sickened in that outbreak were hospitalized, the CDC said. No deaths have been linked to the outbreak. The FDA said Monday that the sprouts were distributed in Indiana, Iowa, Missouri and possibly other midwestern states, with roughly half the illnesses occurring in Illinois. Health officials had previously said the salmonella outbreak had sickened at least 89 people in 15 states and the District of Columbia. Salmonella is a bacterial infection that usually lasts four to seven days. About 40,000 cases of salmonellosis are reported each year in the United States, according to the CDC. Those who get it typically develop fever, abdominal cramps and diarrhea between 12 and 72 hours after becoming infected. Most people recover on their own, without needing significant treatment. But salmonella in very young and very old people, as well as those with weakened immune systems can lead to severe illness and even death. The CDC recommends that anyone suspecting he or she may be ill from eating contaminated food should talk to a doctor.","Parsley, cilantro recalled in 14 states, two Canadian provinces .

"(Oprah.com)  -- If you've ever wanted to run away and join the circus, Beverly Sobelman -- intrepid aerial artist and midlife career changer -- can show you how. In the spring of 2003, software developer Beverly Sobelman was 39 years old and near the top of the heap at Microsoft, sitting at conference tables with Bill Gates and ""managing people who managed people who managed people,"" as she puts it. And then she quit. ""I can't be in another meeting where people just get yelled at,"" she explained in her exit interview. Sobelman spent a few months teaching yoga and living off her savings, she says, ""but I didn't know what the next thing was going to be, which was a little scary."" One day a rock-climbing buddy mentioned a class he'd been taking in circus aerials: the kind of midair acrobatics perfected by Cirque du Soleil. Sobelman tried a session and was instantly hooked -- even obsessed. She traveled to Melbourne, Australia, for months of training with Circus Oz and the National Institute for Circus Arts. (""My teacher was a lovely old French lady who liked me because I wasn't 20."") Once back in Seattle, she started performing and teaching with a small troupe. ""Aerials are a way to exercise that's fun and creative and social -- even more so than your average dance or yoga class,"" she says. Beginners might get the heebie-jeebies watching Sobelman shimmy 30 feet up a silk banner to dance, spin, and tumble in thin air. But aerials can be done by people of all ages and abilities -- at least when Sobelman is your instructor. Your great idea, whose time has come . ""If students can't manage a skill, I will find one they can do, so everyone walks out of the room feeling good,"" she says. ""I get a lot of people who were traumatized in grade school because they couldn't climb a rope in gym class. There have been very few people I couldn't get up a rope."" By 2007 Sobelman's classes were so popular -- particularly with women in their early 20s to mid-40s -- that she founded Versatile Arts, Seattle's first full-time aerial studio. ""I never wanted to take the risk of starting a business,"" says Sobelman, who teaches six group sessions a week and tutors students privately. ""Yet here I am. I've accidentally created a community: People come for their classes, but they also drop by to see their friends and help each other."" How to find happiness at work . She has also accidentally transformed herself. ""I used to think of myself as the person who gets stuff done, not the person who comes up with the ideas,"" she explains. ""I cooked from recipes and sewed from patterns. So the first time I created a performance routine that seemed interesting and creative and graceful -- that was a revelation. Even now, when I hear a song on the radio and start thinking of choreography, or when I cook a meal based on whatever's in the fridge, I'm aware that I've changed.""

"(CNN) -- The new-look Miami Heat insist it is too early to judge their NBA title credentials after losing their opening game of the season 88-80 to the Boston Celtics on Tuesday. In one of the most highly-anticipated games in the series' history, the Heat -- complete with their star trio of Dwayne Wade and new signings Chris Bosh and LeBron James -- could not live up to close season expectations against the 17-time NBA finals champions. But James -- who announced his decision to leave the Cleveland Cavaliers to join Miami in dramatic fashion on an hour-long television program on ESPN in July -- believes his new team can improve sufficiently before the end of the season in April next year. ""It's a feel-out process,'' James told the official NBA website after the loss. ""Rome wasn't built in one day, it's going to take time. We understand that."" ""This is one of 82 [games],''  added Wade. ""Sorry if everyone thought we were going to go 82 and 0. It just ain't happening.'' Dubbed as the NBA's new ""dream team,"" the Heat were greeted with chants of ""overrated"" from the packed crowd at the TD Garden arena in Boston, as they struggled to score just nine points in the first quarter and found themselves trailing 45-30 at half-time. Returning from a hamstring injury, Wade finished with 13 points and Bosh made just eight. James, the final member of ""The Big Three"" led the team with a total of 31, but despite scoring 21 in the final quarter his effort was still not enough to topple the defending Eastern Conference champions. Boston were by far the more consistent side with Ray Allen scoring 20 for the east coast team, while Paul Pierce added 19 and Kevin Garnett contributed 10. Shaquille O'Neal -- James's former teammate in Ohio and part of Miami's NBA finals winning team along with Wade in 2006 -- scored nine points on his debut for the Celtics. Rajon Rondo also made 17 assists for the east coast team -- only two more than the whole of the Heat put together. Boston will next take on the Cleveland Cavaliers away on Wednesday, while Miami will be hoping to get their first win of the season against Philadelphia also on Wednesday. Also in action in the Western Conference on Tuesday were defending champions the L.A. Lakers, who beat the Houston Rockets 112-110. Kobe Bryant finished with 27 points and Spain's Pau Gasol with 29, as the Californian side opened the defense of their title. But the Texan side made the champions work hard for their victory at the Los Angeles Staples Center, with the two teams trading the lead four times in the final minute of play. Elsewhere, the Portland Trailblazers recorded their first win of the season after defeating the Phoenix Suns 106-92. The Blazers trailed 81-75 going into the final quarter of the game, but outscored rivals the Suns 31-11 in the closing stages.","Miami Heat lost to Boston Celtics 88-80 in opening match of 2010-11 NBA championships on Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- Phhhhht! Blllttt! That's the sound of the whoopee cushion that Leslie Nielsen placed on the chairs of his co-workers while filming the first ""Naked Gun"" movie. I was on the set one day during the shoot, working on a feature for the L.A. Daily News -- a day punctuated by loud, gassy-sounding eruptions, often followed by Nielsen cackling insanely at his juvenile pranks. Yep, Leslie Nielsen, who died yesterday at the age of 84, was that kind of guy. A jokester inside a leading man's body. A straight man with comedic instincts. Someone who always knew he was basically Chuckles the Clown, but didn't get to prove it until he'd been a working actor for nearly 30 years. So while we're chuckling, as we go about our lives today, at the very thought of bumbling Lt. Frank Drebin, and all those other clueless wonders he so effortlessly portrayed, let us give thanks that Nielsen got the chance to show us his comedic chops. We are all the richer, and happier, for it. Actually, let's thank those ZAZ guys -- Jerry Zucker, David Zucker and Jim Abrahams -- the co-directors of the 1980 film ""Airplane,"" who cast the Canadian actor against type as a dumber-than-dirt doctor, whose response to the line ""Surely you can't be serious"" was the classic ""I am serious, and don't call me Shirley.""  The exchange is so famous, it popped up at No. 79 on the American Film Institute's list of Top 100 Movie Quotes. Leslie Nielsen dead at 84 . From that point on, Nielsen -- who had been making a living as a handsome, but rather stiff, leading man in such films as ""Forbidden Planet,"" ""Tammy and the Bachelor"" and ""The Poseidon Adventure"" -- had found his calling. Or, as he put it when people questioned casting him in ""Airplane"": ""I've always been cast against type before."" ""Airplane,"" of course, led to the short-lived but much beloved TV series ""Police Squad,"" with Nielsen as the utterly bewildered Frank Drebin. Despite its failure on the tube, the ZAZ guys, seeing its real potential, restructured it as a feature film, 1988's ""The Naked Gun,"" which was so successful it spawned two sequels. In all these films, and such later work as ""Spy Hard,""  ""Dracula: Dead and Loving It"" and ""All I want for Christmas,"" the Nielsen style rapidly became famous: a combination of physical pratfalls, straight-faced delivery, and absurd dialogue aimed straight at 14-year-olds -- and adults who quickly rediscovered the 14-year-old within. iReport: Share your memories of Leslie Nielsen . ""It's true what they say,"" says Drebin in a typically ridiculous comment from ""The Naked Gun."" ""Cops and women don't mix. It's like eating a spoonful of Drano; sure, it'll clean you out, but it'll leave you hollow inside."" Always a master at double takes and popeyed wonder, Nielsen was a genius when it came to deadpan. No matter what was happening around him, the elegant-looking, silver-haired actor seemed to be in a world of his own, and that was the point. Obliviousness became his metier, a means and end in itself, an eternally funny comedic riff that Nielsen seemed born to play. He was helped, of course, by the endless non sequiturs in the ""Airplane"" and ""Naked Gun"" scripts, all heavily influenced by the anarchic lunacy of MAD Magazine. But Nielsen's gift was that, unlike comic actors who might give a wink-wink, nudge-nudge to lines like ""It's fourth and 15 and you're looking at a full court press,"" he recited them with a gravity that sounded like it came straight from ""King Lear."" Who could resist? From drama to comedy, Nielsen made it look easy . Certainly not the critics, who appreciated Nielsen's art, if not always the films he appeared in. Reviewing ""The Naked Gun"" in The New York Times, Janet Maslin -- who called the ZAZ comedy style ""proudly sophomoric"" -- added that the film had an aura of ""unexpected sophistication,"" thanks to the ""dapper presence of Leslie Nielsen who, as Lt. Frank Drebin, manages to bring something heroic to the role of a perfectly oblivious fall guy."" Nielsen, of course, was never really oblivious; he knew exactly what he was doing every second he was onscreen. But unlike a lot of funny guys, who are actually sober and morose in real life, what you saw with Nielsen was what you got: He really was a goofball. So when we think about the passing of a man who gave us so much to laugh at, what else is there to say but -- Phhhhttttt! The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Lewis Beale.","Lewis Beale says Leslie Nielsen pulled on-set pranks during ""Naked Gun"" shoots .

"(CNN) -- Actress Zsa Zsa Gabor is hospitalized again and will have part of a leg amputated, according to her representative. John Blanchette said cancerous lesions started appearing on one of Gabor's legs, which were examined Sunday, and gangrene was imminent. Gabor was being prepared for surgery Sunday night. Her leg will be amputated below the knee, Blanchette said. Gabor's husband, Prince Frederic Von Anhalt, is with her in the hospital, Blanchette said. In November, Gabor was hospitalized for a swollen leg, her husband said at the time. Paramedics initially suspected Gabor suffered from a blood clot in her left leg, but an emergency room doctor at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center later determined she had an infection, according to Von Anhalt. Gabor has been frail and ""pretty much confined to a wheelchair"" since a 2002 car accident, Von Anhalt has said. The crash happened when the car in which she was riding with her hairdresser slammed into a light pole on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. The Hungarian-born actress, the second of the three celebrated Gabor sisters, is most famous for her many marriages. Among her husbands was Oscar-winning actor George Sanders. Her more prominent films include John Huston's 1952 Toulouse-Lautrec biopic, ""Moulin Rouge""; ""The Story of Three Loves"" in 1953; ""The Girl in the Kremlin"" in 1957; and Orson Welles' 1958 classic, ""Touch of Evil.""","Zsa Zsa Gabor will have her leg amputated below the knee .

"(CNN) -- The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta has claimed responsibility for an attack on an oil rig and the kidnapping of seven people. MEND is one of several militant groups in the oil-rich Niger Delta that has been battling the government for years over the distribution of the country's oil wealth. CNN could not independently confirm the group's claim. MEND said in a statement that its fighters carried out the attack on the Transocean rig off the southern coast of Nigeria at Okoro field. ""All the abducted expatriates are well and in our safe custody,"" the statement said. ""All the fighters who participated in this attack have safely returned to base. Within the next 24 hours, we will release the names of all expatriates currently being held in our different camps."" London, England-based Afren PLC said two Indonesians, two Americans, two French and one Canadian were kidnapped. The Indonesians were not included in an earlier tally released by the company. Two crew members are in stable condition at a shore-based clinic, where they were airlifted after being wounded. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said the United States is in contact with Nigerian officials. ""We [are], of course, concerned about their safety and hope for their immediate release,"" he said. ""We are working with Nigerian authorities ... to pursue their prompt release, and there's an investigation already under way."" Drilling operations in the Okoro field have been temporarily suspended, both companies said. In a news release, Afren said a ""security breach"" occurred soon after its High Island VII jackup rig arrived but before drilling had commenced. ""The situation has not been resolved. Afren is doing everything it can to resolve the situation as quickly as possible, and it is working with relevant agencies in the Nigerian government,"" Afren spokesman James Henderson told CNN. Transocean operates six offshore rigs in Nigeria -- two deepwater rigs, two ultra-deepwater rigs and two shallow-water rigs, including the one involved in the incident, said Guy Cantwell, a spokesman for the Houston, Texas-based company.

"(CNN) -- Poultry firm Venky's have become the first ever Indian owners of an English Premier League club after they completed a $36 million takeover of Blackburn Rovers. The deal was confirmed on Rovers' website Friday as the club's board announced it had sold its 99.9% shareholding to Venky's London Limited, a newly formed company owned by the Rao family of India. Venky's paid 17.17 pence (27 cents) a share and will now make an equivalent offer to the minority shareholders. They have a range of business interests in India and overseas but their flagship company is Venkateshwara Hatcheries Private Limited. The takeover ends Rovers' long association with previous owner Jack Walker, who died in 2000. He turned the club into a top flight force, culminating in their Premiership title victory under Kenny Dalglish in the 1994/95 season. Walker established a trust in his own name to take over the running of the club after his death but the sale has now allowed an Indian firm to make their Premier League debut. Paul Egerton-Vernon, Chairman of the Jack Walker Settlement Trustees, told the club's website: ""We are very pleased to be passing on the Rovers to the Rao family. ""We have been impressed with their enthusiasm for the club and their plans and ideas for future investment to develop it further as well as their wish and commitment to preserve the legacy of Jack Walker. ""Over the last 10 years, the global appeal of the Premier League has grown significantly and it is only natural that, as we have seen at other clubs, international ownership and investment should increase."" Anuradha J Desai, the Chairperson of Venky's, said: ""We are delighted, proud and humbled to be associated with Blackburn Rovers, a team with whom we share many values and ambitions. ""Going forward we plan to focus on leveraging the global influence in establishing Blackburn Rovers as a truly global brand. We will absolutely respect the Jack Walker legacy and will be actively supporting the organization to ensure that Blackburn Rovers remains one of the best run clubs within the Premier League.

"(CNN) -- Portugal earned a satisfying 4-0 win over world-champion neighbors Spain on Wednesday night, while France continued to improve under Laurent Blanc with a 2-1 victory away to England in another friendly. Spain won the last clash between the two teams in July on the way to winning the World Cup in South Africa, ending Portugal's 19-match unbeaten run. But Helder Postiga struck twice after Carlos Martins broke the deadlock before substitute Hugo Almeida settled the match for Portugal, who have put in a joint bid with Spain to host the 2018 World Cup and are celebrating the 100th year of the Portuguese Republic. Midfielder Martins volleyed the opening goal right on halftime after Cristiano Ronaldo's shot was only blocked by Spain goalkeeper Iker Casillas. Postiga doubled the lead four minutes after the interval with a clever backheel from Joao Moutinho's low right-wing cross, and the Sporting Lisbon striker fired in the third with 22 minutes to play when Spain's defense could not clear. Almeida then beat the offside trap to collect Pepe's throughball and beat the onrushing Casillas in the fourth minute of time added on to score his 12th international goal. It was only Portugal's second win in nine meetings with Spain, who have not won in Lisbon since 1934. France inflicted England's first defeat at London's Wembley stadium since Fabio Capello took charge in December 2007, taking the lead through Karim Benzema and Mathieu Valbuena before substitute Peter Crouch's late consolation. Benzema fired the opening goal in the 16th minute with a low shot past goalkeeper Ben Foster at the near post following a smart interchange of passes with Florent Malouda. Capello's experimental young England team went 2-0 down in the 55th minute when fullback Bacary Sagna found space down the right and midfielder Valbuena volleyed in a low shot after teammate Sami Nasri completely missed his attempt. Striker Crouch, who came on for the injured Steven Gerrard, guided in a clever volley at the far post from Ashley Young's 85th-minute corner for his 23rd goal in 43 England appearances, but it was not enough to prevent his team being booed off. France, who also beat England in Capello's second match in charge, have now won four successive matches under coach Blanc -- who suffered two defeats after taking over from Raymond Domenech following Les Bleus' first-round World Cup exit. Italy were held 1-1 by Romania in Austria as Ciprian Marica scored at both ends. The striker put Romania ahead in the 34th minute after the Italian defense failed to clear, but headed past his own goalkeeper with seven minutes to play after Italy substitute Fabio Quagliarella touched on a corner by halftime replacement Andrea Pirlo. Germany drew 0-0 away to Sweden in Gothenburg in a match of few chances as both teams' coaches experimented with their line-ups. Norway won 2-1 away to the Republic of Ireland, World Cup dark horses Slovakia lost 3-2 at home to Bosnia-Herzegovina, while Serbia won 1-0 in Bulgaria with an 80th-minute goal from striker Nikolai Zigic -- who was later sent off. Russia, who also hope to host the 2018 World Cup, lost 2-0 at home to Belgium as highly-rated young striker Romelu Lukaku scored both goals in Voronezh. The Netherlands, bidding jointly for 2018 with Belgium, beat Turkey 1-0 in Amsterdam as striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scored the winner in the 52nd minute with his ninth goal in the last five internationals.","Portugal avenge World Cup defeat against Spain with 4-0 victory in Lisbon .

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- The convoy of a leading Haitian presidential candidate came under attack from gunmen, the candidate's sister said Tuesday. ""We just cannot believe it. It's unbelievable. We're still in shock,"" said Rita Celestin-Rancy, a sister of Jude Celestin, who was traveling with her brother's 20-vehicle convoy to the southern city of Jeremie when they came under fire near Beaumont. Celestin-Rancy said one person was killed and another wounded. Police did not return calls from CNN. Campaign manager Joseph Flambert called into Haiti's Radio Caraibes to say the convoy retreated after a ""hail of bullets."" Celestin, a director of Haiti's road construction department, is the endorsed candidate of outgoing Haitian President Rene Preval. Celestin is one of 19 Haitians vying for the nation's top office. Celestin-Rancy declined to speculate on whether Monday night's attack was politically motivated. She said her brother's campaign was awaiting the results of a police investigation. Candidates have been ramping up their campaigns in the final days before the vote. The streets of the Haitian capital throbbed Monday with music emanating from mobile speakers carrying messages of support for some of the 19 presidential candidates. Tensions exploded as well in the western coastal town of Miragoane, where resident Antony Gae told CNN on Monday that police fired guns to disperse demonstrators who were burning tires and accusing Haiti's main electoral commission of bias. But planning for Sunday's scheduled presidential election and legislative elections is moving forward, U.S. Ambassador to Haiti Kenneth Merten told reporters Tuesday from Port-au-Prince. ""While much remains to be done this week, the process is on track: 250,000 new voters were registered and more than 11,000 voting stations have been identified,"" Merten said. The Haitian Conseil Electoral Provisoire, or CEP, is overseeing the plans to ensure ""free, fair, and transparent"" elections, he said. The Haitian National Police is in charge of Election Day security, with support from the U.N. stabilization mission in Haiti, known by its French acronym, MINUSTAH. A number of observers are in Haiti, including the Joint Electoral Observation Mission, an effort of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community of Nations. The mission is expected to have more than 100 observers deployed across the country as monitors, he said. Another 5,000 to 7,000 electoral observers belonging to Haitian civil society groups will be ""keeping an eye on things,"" Merten said. He noted that the Haitian government has said there is no public health reason for the elections not to take place. ""I see them as two separate issues,"" Merten said. ""We have a cholera problem here, which is something that the Haitians and we are all grappling with, which is a major public health challenge here. And we have the elections which should take place, need to take place, and we are here to support that effort."" According to a recent report by the International Crisis Group, Haiti has held 13 elections since 1987, the ""majority of which have been marred by delays, suspensions, widespread irregularities, fraud, boycotts, unrest and violence."" Cholera has killed at least 1,415 people and sickened more than 60,000, the Haitian government said Tuesday.

"Los Angeles, California(CNN) -- Christina Aguilera signed her name to a divorce petition that was filed against husband Jordan Bratman in Los Angeles County Superior Court on Thursday. The 29-year-old singer-actress cited ""irreconcilable differences"" as the cause of the split from the 33-year-old music executive she married five years ago. Aguilera's petition said a prenuptial agreement should dictate how they separate their assets. That agreement called for Jordan to get none of the money Aguilera earned before, during or after their marriage. She is asking the judge to grant joint legal and physical custody of the couple's 2-year-old son, Max.

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- Indonesia's government, already beset by a killer earthquake and tsunami, moved Wednesday to help tens of thousands of residents displaced by a volcanic eruption that also claimed 29 lives. Thirty-eight people were injured and 42,000 were evacuated around Mount Merapi on Java, according to the country's National Disaster Agency. The volcano erupted at least three times Tuesday, forcing residents to flee. Merapi, which looms on the horizon north of the major city of Yogyakarta, is one of Indonesia's most active volcanoes and lies in one of the world's most densely populated areas. The volcano has a summit elevation of nearly 10,000 feet (3,000 meters). Because no new lava dome has formed, Merapi remains dangerous, a government assessment team leader told the official news agency Antara. Hundreds of displaced residents crammed a small government building in Yogyakarta. Many had fled with only the clothes on their backs. Slamet Riady, 64, has lived through Merapi's many eruptions. ""This was bigger than the past eruptions,"" he said. ""They rang the siren, and we had no time to bring anything. The most important thing was to save ourselves."" Nearby, volunteers led a group of young children in song and dance. Yoppy Riskiadi said many of the children are going through a stressful situation and need a sense of normalcy. ""We're here to cheer them up so they can be happy and be children,"" he said. ""It's simple. We sing, dance and act crazy. They're children and they should be carefree."" Merapi's volcanic activities have decreased significantly, Indonesian chief volcanologist Surono told CNN. ""An explosive eruption will not happen again in the near future,"" Surono said. Merapi spewed more ash this time than in previous eruptions, he said. CNN iReporter Prasakti Ramadhana told CNN the volcanic ash produced heat in the area. Ramadhana, who lives about 12 miles from Merapi, said rain Wednesday night was limiting the spread of ash. The volcano and the recent Indonesian earthquake and tsunami forced President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono to cut short a visit to Vietnam, Antara reported. Medical and food donations for volcano victims were coming in, Antara said. CNN's Brian Walker and Phil Gast contributed to this report.","NEW: Volcano has not formed new lava dome .

"SEASIDE, Oregon (CNN) -- One day in 1957, when Jeff Daly was 6 years old, his little sister, Molly, disappeared. Jeff Daly's efforts to find his sister, Molly, led to a new Oregon law about records for institutions for the disabled. Every night at dinner, he would ask his parents the same question, ""Where's Molly?"" Every night, he says, he received the same answer: ""Stop asking about Molly."" Decades later, Daly learned that his parents had sent Molly to a state institution nine days before her third birthday. Nearly 50 years later, Daly found his sister and made a documentary about his search. ""Since the movie, literally hundreds of people have come up to us and said, 'I had a [relative] that I remember my family talking about that was sent away. Do you know how we can find out about that person?'"" says Daly.  Interactive: Watch Jeff Daly tell more about his and Molly's story » . An increasing number of people are trying to reconnect with family members sent to live in institutions decades ago, advocates for the disabled say. The Arc, a national advocacy organization for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, has created a new online family registry and search service, the FindFamily Registry, to help with such reunions. Through the registry, The ArcLink, a family services venture associated with The Arc, is compiling a database of information from family members seeking loved ones, as well as from caregivers hoping to find relatives of the people they're caring for. From that database, ArcLink staff will work to make connections. To prevent abuse, The ArcLink will carefully screen people seeking information. When a match is found, both parties will be notified. It's unknown exactly how many children were institutionalized in the last century. In 1967, at the height of institutionalization, as many as 100,000 children were housed in 162 state facilities across the U.S., according to Charlie Lakin, a professor at the University of Minnesota who studies the history of institutionalization. Other experts put the number of institutions as high as 200. Guest blog: Reflections on what is 'different.' Most of the people sent to institutions had some sort of developmental disability -- Down syndrome, retardation, cerebral palsy or autism, for example. Some also were sent to institutions because they were viewed as ""slow."" Many had other kinds of secondary disabilities, such as being in a wheelchair. In a few cases, able-bodied people also ended up in state facilities because their families could not support them financially.  Watch how Daly answered the question: ""Where's Molly?"" » . Conditions could be horrific, Lakin said. Residents were sometimes restrained in leather cuffs or straitjackets, overly sedated, isolated for long periods of time, and in many cases, sterilized. Many had little or no contact with their families. Read the first-person story of a mom's love for her disabled son. Such treatment was considered appropriate. Over the 19th centuries and 20th centuries, society's treatment of people with intellectual disabilities changed. From an early mission of training ""productive workers"" who would return to their communities, state schools for the disabled evolved into often overcrowded permanent homes, as fear and stigma colored public attitudes about people who were different. Many parents also didn't have the means or support system to keep a child with a disability at home. There was no ""mainstreaming"" of children with disabilities in schools.   Interactive: How attitudes toward people with intellectual disabilities have changed » . In the 1960s, under President John F. Kennedy, who himself had an intellectually handicapped sister, new federal laws boosted funding for resources and research on intellectual disabilities. In the 1970s, after a series of lawsuits in federal courts led to a push toward independent living for people with intellectual disabilities, the institutions began closing. Most residents were sent to smaller group homes. As difficult as it is for modern-day parents to fathom, parents sent children away under the advice of their doctors, historians say. ""Back then, the standard physician message to parents with a disabled infant was, 'You can't handle this. Give the baby to the state, and don't worry about it,' "" says Elbert Johns, president of The ArcLink, which provides information about services and service providers and technology resources to families of the developmentally disabled. Bill Lynch, executive director of the Oregon Council on Developmental Disabilities, says it's hard to appreciate the culture of decades ago. ""There was a lot of shame on the part of these families,"" he said. ""There was such a huge stigma to disability. We're still getting over that."" Many who try to reconnect do so against the wishes of the parents of the disabled child, who still feel that shame, Johns says. ""There was once a motivation on the part of families to dump and forget,"" Johns says. ""The parents made a major life decision decades ago, and now somebody's questioning that."" But he said when people do reach out, ""that reconnection is pretty precious."" Molly's medical records indicate that she was born with a club foot and a lazy eye, which was left blind after surgery. When she was around 2, records show, doctors amended her diagnosis to ""profoundly retarded,"" a characterization that Daly doubts but has no proof to contradict. Daly says his father tried to stay connected to Molly and visited her at Fairview, the Oregon state institution where she had gone to live. But because Molly became so upset each time he left, the staff asked him to stop coming, Daly says. Daly says his own search for Molly, which he recounts in the documentary ""Where's Molly?"" was relatively easy. Even though his parents wouldn't talk about Molly after she left, his father kept meticulous records. In 2004, after his parents had died, Daly found the phone number for the group home where Molly was sent after Fairview closed in 2000. ""He left clues for us. He left us little bits of information that gave us the ability to find Molly,"" he says. ""I know he wanted me to find Molly."" E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- Israel's military is using a new weapon to catch draft-dodgers: the social networking site Facebook. The army says it checks the home pages of those who have sought an exemption from military service because they are orthodox -- religiously observant. The pages sometimes provide evidence that the people have done things that a strictly observant Jew would not do. About 1,000 female Israelis in the past two years who had claimed to be orthodox have had to ""rephrase their religious declarations"" and do their military service after being found out, Israeli military spokeswoman Avital Leibovich told CNN. Military service is obligatory for Israelis from the age of 18. Men serve three years, women serve two. Some reasons, including religious observance, can be claimed to avoid this. Leibovich said checking Facebook is just one tactic used to uncover false religious claims. Questioning and background checks also are done. But with Facebook, Leibovich said, the military can ""check whether a person is taking photos on Shabbat (the Jewish sabbath), whether they are wearing something that is not modest or updating their status on Shabbat."" Orthodox Jews are not allowed to use machinery like cameras or computers on the sabbath. The military has also caught draft-dodgers by seeing photos of them in a non-kosher restaurant.","Facebook pages can reveal false claims for a religious exemption from the draft .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israel started building a barrier along its border with Egypt Monday. The Israeli government says it is to prevent illegal immigrants from crossing into the country and to stop smuggling. The 240-kilometer-long, $370 million barrier will be part fence and part surveillance technology. The project was announced in January by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. ""This is a strategic decision to ensure the Jewish and democratic character of the state of Israel,"" he said. The Israeli military estimates around 5,000 infiltrators entered Israel over the past year as well as 1.3 tonnes of hash and 130 kilograms of heroin. Israeli human rights group Hotline for Migrant Workers estimates 90 percent of those crossing the border illegally are refugees from northern Africa. The rest are thought to be migrant workers or traffickers of drugs and women. The barrier could take several years to build across some difficult terrain. Israel's former ambassador to Egypt, Eli Shaked, told CNN there is nothing political about the decision to build it. ""It is a necessity. It had to be done a long time ago. It is not something directed at Egypt,"" he said. Israel has already built a controversial barrier separating the West Bank from Israel. Construction started in 2002 in an attempt to stem the tide of Palestinian suicide bombing attacks during the course of the second intifada, which began in September 2000. Palestinians claim it is a land grab and has separated farmers from their lands and sometimes families from each other. The United Nations says 80 percent of it is built on Palestinian land.","Construction begins on a barrier along Israel's southern border .

"New York (CNN) -- Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani was acquitted Wednesday of all but one count of conspiracy-related charges in a landmark civilian trial involving the first Guantanamo detainee to be tried in civilian court. Ghailani was convicted by a federal jury on a charge of conspiracy to destroy buildings and U.S. property in connection with his role in the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania. The trial had been widely considered a testing ground for the Obama administration, which has said that it could try some terrorism suspects outside military tribunals and in civilian courts. Ghailani's lawyer, Peter Quijano, said Wednesday's verdict was ""a reaffirmation that this nation's judicial system is the greatest ever devised."" ""It is a truly a system of laws and not men,"" he said. The U.S. Justice Department responded in a written statement, referring to the one guilty finding by saying, ""We respect the jury's verdict and are pleased that Ahmed Ghailani now faces a minimum of 20 years in prison and a potential life sentence for his role in the embassy bombings."" U.S. Attorney Prett Bharara in a statement that he would seek the maximum sentence of life without parole at sentencing, which is scheduled for January. Ghailani faced charges of conspiracy and murder in the 1998 attacks on U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The bombings, for which al Qaeda claimed responsibility, killed 224 people, including a dozen Americans, and wounded thousands of others. Federal Judge Lewis Kaplan had rejected a defense plea for a mistrial on Monday after a juror claimed to have been chastised by fellow jurors for disagreeing with their conclusions. Kaplan read aloud a note that he received from the juror, who asked to be ""excused or exchanged"" in the trial of the 36-year-old Tanzanian, telling his defense attorneys that it was not grounds for a mistrial. Ghailani's attorneys had maintained that he was exploited by al Qaeda for his knowledge of Tanzania, but was not a conspiring member of the group that later claimed responsibility for the attacks. Wednesday's verdict raises broader questions regarding those being held in the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba and their prospects of facing civilian courts. ""The greater relevance has been the debate in this country of whether [alleged] terrorists held in Guantanamo can effectively be tried in a federal district court even though there may be problems with government witnesses,"" said Scott Silliman, executive director for the Center on Law, Ethics and National Security. Kaplan previously had ruled that prosecutors couldn't call a key witness in the trial because Ghailani was coerced into disclosing the witness' identity. Reaction to the verdict was quick in coming. Liz Cheney, daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney and a co-founder of the group Keep America Safe, joined in a statement from the group lashing out at the Obama administration for having ""rolled the dice in a time of war"" with a civilian trial. The statement called on Obama to ""end this reckless experiment. Reverse course. Use the military commissions at Guantanamo that Congress has authorized."" Meanwhile, human rights advocates lauded Wednesday's verdict as evidence of a fair trial, which they said signals ""the [Obama] administration should move forward with other detainees they wanted to try,"" according to Dixon Osburn, spokesman for Human Rights First -- a New York-based advocacy group. ""Those that said [the trial of Guantanamo detainees in civilian courts] would be a circus were proven wrong,"" he said. By contrast, Rep. Peter King, R-New York, said he was ""disgusted at the total miscarriage of justice today in Manhattan's federal civilian court."" King, who is the House's incoming Homeland Security Committee chairman, blamed Attorney General Eric Holder for the trial's outcome. ""He assured us that 'failure is not an option,'"" King said in a written statement. The prosecution, which made its closing arguments November 8, had accused Ghailani in a total of 285 counts of conspiracy and terrorism-related charges. Ghailani was captured in Pakistan in 2004 and moved to Guantanamo two years later. He was transferred last year to a federal prison in New York.

"(CNN) -- Chelsea coach Carlo Ancelotti has dismissed reports he is about to quit the English Premier League champions. Newspaper speculation on Monday claimed the Italian was on the verge of walking out of Stamford Bridge after a turbulent few weeks at the London club. Chelsea have lost three of their last four matches and the club sacked Ancelotti's assistant Ray Wilkins earlier this month, sparking speculation over his position. It had been claimed the 51-year-old contacted the League Managers' Association on Sunday night to discuss his position. But at a press conference ahead of Chelsea's Champions League tie with Slovakian side MSK Zilina on Tuesday, Ancelotti said the rumors were ""totally untrue"". ""I don't know if it is enough to clarify my position today to close this rumor and speculation,"" began the 51-year-old. ""These rumors are totally untrue, I don't know why this rumor came out today in the papers. ""The LMA (League Managers' Association) called me last night to understand what was happening, but I was at home. These rumors are totally untrue. ""I have my contract until 2012 here in this club, I said a lot of times I would like to stay here, that I love this club, I love these players and have a lot of confidence in these players and this squad so there is no reason to change my idea. ""I said before my aim is to stay in this club, this country, this atmosphere for a long time. I think it depends on me. In the last year I did a good job and this year I would like to do the same. My aim is to stay here, I don't want to say like Ferguson because I think it is impossible, but my aim is this. I would like to stay here."" The departure of Wilkins, who played for the club for six years, coupled with a poor run of form has put pressure on Ancelotti, even though Chelsea remain top of the Premier League table. But the Italian, who led former club AC Milan to two Champions League titles, insisted the scrutiny that comes with his job is something he enjoys. ""There is no reason to think about my position. My position is very clear, I am the coach and I have to train my players and maintain the club to the best level,"" he added. ""This moment is not so good on the pitch and we have to do better there, we have to stay in focus on this because this is the problem. The problem is on the pitch.

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Border Patrol agent killed Tuesday night in Arizona was shot after he confronted a group of bandits believed to be preying on illegal immigrants in the desert north of the border, the head of the Border Patrol union said Wednesday. The FBI and the Santa Cruz County Sheriff's Office, which are jointly investigating the shooting, have provided scant details of the circumstances leading up to the shooting. But T.J. Bonner, president of the National Border Patrol Council, said Brian A. Terry was operating as part of a tactical unit conducting surveillance for bandits when they encountered a group of five people and a gunfight broke out. ""They had received information about bandit activity in that area,"" Bonner said. ""It's an area that is notorious for that, despite the fact it is so far from the border. I think it was about 18 miles from the border."" FBI Special Agent Manuel J. Johnson said agents were patrolling a very remote and rugged area north of the border town of Nogales when they encountered several armed individuals. Initial information shows there was an exchange of gunfire, he said. Terry was shot and later died, Johnson said. Four men were apprehended and one of the captured suspects was taken to a hospital with a gunshot wound. Authorities are searching for a fifth man, he said. Bonner said ""border bandits"" typically prey on illegal immigrants in the area, accosting them with guns and stealing whatever money or possessions they have. ""The border is not secure,"" Bonner said. ""Those who say that it's secure are either misinformed or they're being disingenuous. If you have bandits operating that far north into the United States and there's enough activity to sustain that (criminal enterprise), it tells you there's a lot of traffic getting by the Border Patrol."" Calling it ""a real tragedy any time you lose a law enforcement officer in the line of duty,"" Bonner said, ""There are men and women who go out and risk their lives every night. It never gets easy and it seems to get harder every time you lose another brother from law enforcement."" Terry, a native of Detroit had served 3 1/2 years in the Border Patrol  and four years in the military, Bonner said. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with the Terry family for their tragic loss,"" said Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Alan Bersin. ""Our commitment to Agent Terry and his family is that we will do everything possible to bring to justice those responsible for this despicable act."" ""The fatal shooting of Border Patrol Agent Brian A. Terry last night is an unconscionable act of violence against the men and women of the Border Patrol and all those who serve and defend our country,"" Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano -- the former governor of Arizona -- said in a statement. She said Terry's death ""is a stark reminder of the very real dangers our men and women on the front lines confront every day as they protect our communities and the American people."" She said authorities ""will leave no stone unturned as we seek justice for the perpetrators"" and offered her condolences to Terry's family. Gov. Jan Brewer ordered flags to be flown at half-staff to honor Terry. Brewer said Terry is survived by his parents, a brother and two sisters. ""Our prayers are with his family, as well as all Border Patrol agents and their families,"" Brewer said. Terry is the third Border Patrol agent to be killed in the line of duty this year, the Customs and Border Protection agency says. Thirty-four agents have died in the line of duty in the past 15 years, according to agency figures. In August, President Obama signed a bill that provides $600 million in emergency funding to help secure the U.S.-Mexico border. Among other things, the bill provides for roughly 1,500 new law enforcement agents, new unmanned aerial vehicles, new forwarding operating bases and $14 million in new communications equipment. More than 520 National Guard and Army troops were recently assigned to the Arizona-Mexico border through the bill. Federal officials said in July that human smuggling and illegal border crossings were on the rise in the Tucson, Arizona, sector of the border. Monday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents discovered a cross-border smuggling tunnel in Nogales after seizing more than 2,100 pounds of marijuana that was rolled in cylindrical bundles from a van, a statement from the agency said.  It was the shape of the bundles that tipped agents off to the tunnel, the statement said. ""The marijuana bundles resembled previous seizures in which tunnels were used to smuggle narcotics from Mexico into the United States,"" the Immigration and Customs Enforcement statement said. One opening of the 13-foot long tunnel had a 10-inch diameter hole in a street surface in Nogales.  ""The tunnel entrance in Mexico is directly against the International Border Fence and covered with a piece of plywood,"" the agency said.  The tunnel will be filled with concrete. The driver of the van fled, but a passenger was arrested and is facing federal drug and immigration charges, the agency said. CNN's Kara Devlin and Mike M.

"(CNN)  -- Roger Federer regained the title at his hometown tournament in Basle as he beat defending champion Novak Djokovic 6-4 3-6 6-1 in Sunday's final. Serbian star Djokovic ended a run of three straight titles for Federer when he beat the Swiss maestro in last year's final, but there was to be no repeat. It was his third win over the second seed in four meetings this year with his only loss in the U.S. Open semifinals at Flushing Meadows. Federer now has 65 career titles to go fourth in the all-time list, one ahead of American great Pete Sampras. The St. Jakobshalle arena is certainly a happy hunting ground for the 16-time grand slam champion, winning four of the last five finals at the Swiss Indoors tournament and seven from 11. He swept through the deciding set for the loss of a single game to wrap up victory in just under two hours. Federer now heads to the Paris Masters bidding for a hat-trick of tournament titles after winning the Stockholm Open last week. He will be top seed at Bercy in the absence of world number one Rafael Nadal. Meanwhile at the Valencia Open, Spain's David Ferrer beat compatriot Marcel Granollers 7-5 6-3 in Sunday's final. The victory boosts Ferrer's chances of claiming one of the three places available for the season-ending ATP Tour Finals in London later this month with the Paris Masters the final counting event for qualification.","Roger Federer wins Swiss Indoors title with 6-4 3-6 6-1 win over Novak Djokovic .

"(CNN) -- He was once hailed as the next Boris Becker. But, more than a decade later, Nicolas Kiefer has called time on his tennis career after failing to build on the promise that took him to the heights of fourth in the world rankings. ""It is time to start a new chapter in life,"" the 33-year-old, who became a father for the first time in 2010, said in a statement on his official website on Thursday. The German made headlines in 1997 when he reached the quarterfinals of Wimbledon at the tender age of 19, and won his home tournament in Halle two years later -- the third of his six titles on the ATP Tour as he earned more than $7 million on the circuit. He went on to claim an Olympic silver medal in doubles in 2004 with compatriot Rainer Schuttler, before progressing to the last four of the Australian Open in 2006 -- his best performance in a grand slam. What were the top tennis moments of 2010? However, after suffering a wrist injury that year, the player tipped to follow in the footsteps of six-time major winner Becker has struggled to get back to the top of the game, playing on the lowly Challenger Tour and slipping to a world ranking of just 722. ""That's going to follow me around my whole life, but that's okay,"" Kiefer said of the comparisons in an exclusive interview with German newspaper Die Welt. ""There can only be one Boris Becker. He was my biggest motivator. I learned the most from him, and I'm very grateful to him for that. ""Sometimes I just missed out by a pinch. But that's what makes the difference between a Boris Becker and someone not so successful."" Despite having previously said he wanted to continue playing until the 2012 Olympics in London, Kiefer is now looking forward to a new life away from the court with girlfriend Anna and five-month-old daughter Mabelle Emilienne. ""A couple of days ago I looked in the mirror and said to myself -- come on, you've had a great career, you've met lots of great people, traveled to lots of countries, and learnt so much. Enough. You're a father now, you have a daughter,"" he said. ""The last few times I was away, I've known what I've been missing. Every evening I fall asleep next to my daughter Mabelle. Every morning I wake up next to her. Those are moments I don't want to miss."" Known as ""Kiwi"" to his fans, Kiefer will have more time to concentrate on interests away from tennis, including his favorite football team Hanover 96 -- for whom he scored a goal while playing in a friendly match in 2005. Kiefer is also studying for a degree in sports management, and he told Die Welt that he may return to tennis in the future utilizing his newfound skills. ""It will be something exciting, interesting for me,"" he said. ""Maybe in tennis, as a manager or consultant. Why not?""","Nicolas Kiefer retires from professional tennis at the age of 33 .

"(CNN) -- Authorities say a fellow inmate working in the kitchen of a Michigan jail tried to serve a poisoned apple to a serial stabbing suspect after the two had an altercation behind bars. Accused serial stabber Elias Abuelazam never took a bite, Genesee County Sheriff Robert Pickell said Thursday. But Andre Franklin, 34, now faces a charge of attempted poisoning for the September incident. The tainted apple, sprayed with oven degreaser with ""poison components in it,"" never made it out of the kitchen, Pickell said. ""We found out immediately,"" he said but declined to say how guards learned what happened. Pickell said Franklin apparently targeted Abuelazam after the two ""had some words with each other."" Abuelazam is a suspect in 18 stabbings in Michigan, Virginia and Ohio. Five of the attacks were fatal, Genesee County prosecutor David Leyton has said. He has been charged with homicide in three of the five deaths and has been charged with six counts of assault with intent to commit murder. Abuelazam has pleaded not guilty and remains jailed awaiting trial. Pickell said Franklin had nearly completed all of his time for a simple assault charge and was a trustee: a nonviolent prisoner who qualified for jobs that could help reduce his sentence. But if convicted of attempted poisoning, Franklin could face up to 15 more years behind bars, Pickell said.

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- The toll from a series of explosions across Baghdad climbed to at least 64 dead and 360 wounded Wednesday, Iraq's health minister Saleh Mahdi told state television al-Iraqiya. The blasts across the capital Tuesday included 14 car bombs, two roadside bombs and mortar attacks in at least 17 neighborhoods, most of them in Shiite areas, police said. In an earlier report, police said there had been three roadside bombs and a sticky bomb: a device typically placed on a vehicle. Explosions struck the Shiite neighborhoods of Kadhimiya in the northwest; Amil, Bayaa and Shulaa in the southwest; Ur and Zuhour in the northeast; Sadr City, Kamaliya and Amin in the east; and Abu Dhsir in the southern part of the city. Other blasts struck mixed Sunni-Shiite neighborhoods, including Waziriya, Yarmouk, Jihad and Eghraiat. U.S. military advisers went to some of the explosion sites with Iraqi security forces, the military said in a statement. A U.S. military spokesman, Lt. Col. Eric Bloom, said the strikes are typical of al Qaeda in Iraq attacks. During the height of the Iraq war, sectarian violence tore through Baghdad on a daily basis in Sunni and Shiite neighborhoods. Despite a series of recent bombings, ""overall security is good"" and ""attack levels [in Iraq] remain at historically low levels,"" Pentagon spokesman Col. David Lapan said Wednesday. On Tuesday, the Committee to Protect Journalists protested Iraq's move -- carried out Monday -- to close Al-Baghdadiya TV's offices in Baghdad and Basra. The decision came after the Cairo, Egypt-based satellite channel broadcast demands of gunmen who attacked a church in Baghdad on Sunday. The hours-long standoff ended after Iraqi security forces stormed the Sayidat al-Nejat church. In all, 58 people died, and 75 others were wounded; most of the casualties were women and children, the officials added. The Al-Baghdadiya bureau chief in Cairo, Abdelhamid al-Saih, told the journalists group that the shutdown was illegal since there was no judicial order and that he believed authorities were using the broadcast as a pretext to close the offices because the channel had previously given Iraqis the opportunity to criticize the government. ""We are concerned by the closure of Al-Baghdadiya TV and demand that [the government's Communications and Media Commission] explain under what authority it has stormed the station's offices and censored it,"" said Mohamed Abdel Dayem, Middle East and North Africa program coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists. ""We call on the authorities to allow the station to resume its operations immediately."" According to the committee, the government commission said in a statement that the attackers had ""contacted the station and selected it to be the exclusive platform for their inhumane practices with the purpose of disrupting Iraq's national unity and to inflame religious discord."" It said, ""the station's broadcast of demands 'amounts to incitement to violence' and that Al-Baghdadia's coverage was not objective, creating a threat to the military operation by providing attackers with information about ongoing operations to rescue the hostages.""

"(CNN) -- Barcelona produced a masterful second-half display to come from behind and defeat Valencia 2-1 at the Nou Camp on Saturday. The home side went behind after 37 minutes when Pablo Hernandez scored for the visitors. But second half goals from Andres Iniesta and Carles Puyol ensured that Barca secured all three points -- something they have struggled to do at home so far this season, dropping five points in their first three home games. David Villa, who was facing his old club for the first time since his €40 million ($55 million) summer transfer, had several chances to score but was denied by some excellent saves from Valencia's keeper Cesar Sanchez. The win puts Barcelona level on 16 points with Valencia at the top of La Liga. Earlier Atletico Madrid secured a 2-0 win over Getafe at the Vicente Calderon stadium. The victory moves them to within three points of the top spot. An own goal from Getafe keeper Jordi Codina in the first half saw Atletico take the lead. A Diego Costa strike after 72 minutes sealed the points helping the reigning Europa League champions move up to fifth place. Meanwhile in Italy, two goals from Brazilian striker Alexandre Pato helped AC Milan to a 3-1 victory over Chievo at the San Siro on Saturday. Pato's brace made it four goals in as many games for the 21-year-old, while Robinho scored his first goal for the club in the 90th minute to make sure of the victory. The win puts Milan top of Serie A for the first time this season, ahead of Lazio who play Sunday. In Saturday's other game, Roma beat Genoa 2-1 thanks to goals from Marco Borriello and Matteo Brighi. Genoa only goal came courtesy of Gergely Rudolf in the 78th minute.","Barcelona beat league leaders Valencia 2-1 at the Nou Camp to go joint top of table .

"(CNN) -- The family of the U.S. swim star who died over the weekend during a race in the United Arab Emirates mourned Monday as answers to questions surrounding his death remained murky. Fran Crippen, 26, died Saturday during the last leg of the Marathon Swimming World Cup. ""The official word coming out of the UAE ... is that he died from drowning. So now we have to go and figure out exactly how that happened because obviously Fran was a swimmer who was in peak physical shape,"" the swimmer's sister, Maddy Crippen, told CNN. Another athlete in the race told CNN the competition might not have been monitored closely enough. ""I may be mistaken, but I can't remember seeing any boats that were going by us to watch the athletes a little bit closer, especially the ones that were falling behind,"" said German swimmer Jan Wolfgarten. ""With the conditions that extreme, for future reference, there should be people watching what's going on with the athletes,"" Wolfgarten said. Monitors on at least nine boats and four personal watercraft were watching the race, according to event organizers. Wolfgarten said he thought Crippen ""was in just as good a shape as anyone can be."" But both the water and the air were ""really, really warm,"" Wolfgarten told CNN's ""American Morning."" ""The sun came straight down"" during the last lap, just before noon, he said, suggesting it might be better to do the race in late afternoon next year. Crippen's sister said she had heard from people who were there that her brother wasn't ""charging"" like he usually did when he swam. ""He wasn't himself as the race continued,"" she said. U.S. Swimming Federation authorities said they expect to receive the body of the star open-water swimmer Monday. ""In respect for his memory,"" the International Swimming Federation (FINA) canceled the remaining heats in the UAE in the wake of Crippen's death, according the federation's website. The loss of Crippen hit hard in suburban Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he grew up in a family of swimmers. Crippen was on target to achieve his goal of being an Olympian -- a dream cut short. ""We're all grieving. We're all in shock,"" said Richard Shoulberg, his longtime prep school coach. Doctors determined that severe fatigue was behind Crippen's sudden death, UAE Swimming Federation Secretary Saeed Al Hamour told CNN on Sunday. Earlier, however, the head of the water sports club in Fujairah, Ahmed Ibrahim, said that preliminary tests showed the swimmer suffered a heart attack. The official report released by the UAE Swimming Federation made no mention of a heart attack. Crippen died during the last leg of the Marathon Swimming World Cup in Fujairah, the International Swimming Federation said in a news release. The cause of death is under investigation, the federation said. In a conversation with Shoulberg 12 hours before the race, Crippen said that the outside temperature was 100 degrees and that the water was 87 degrees. Some have speculated the high temperatures may have contributed to the death. However, Al Hamour denied any reports that Crippen's death may have been caused by water temperature. ""The competition was monitored and supervised by the International Swimming Federation. All security measures were taken care of as needed,"" Al Hamour said. ""We've organized so far 14 competitions and championships and never had any death."" Swimming World magazine reported that Crippen fell unconscious during the event and deep-sea divers found him two hours later near the race's final buoy. Crippen won bronze in the 10-kilometer event at the 2009 FINA World Championships and was the gold medalist in the same event at the 2007 Pan American Games, according to USA Swimming. Monday, his family released a statement thanking Crippen's fans and friends for their support. ""Fran's life was filled with passion, whether it was swimming for the U.S. or cheering on his beloved Philadelphia Phillies. We take some solace knowing he passed while doing what he loved most, swimming,"" it read.","NEW: Swimmer's family takse solace in knowing ""he passed ... doing what he loved""

"(CNN) -- A planned strike by Spanish footballers has been averted after a Madrid court ruled against a petition filed by a trade union that represents the country's players. The Spanish Players' Association (AFE) had applied to postpone the next round of Spanish league games, including Barcelona's La Liga match against Levante on Sunday, by 24 hours. The union argued that it had an agreement with the Professional Football League that matches would not be played during Spain's winter break which lasts up to and including January 2. But the Spanish High Court decided it had no jurisdiction over the dispute, declaring that it ""it is not competent to decide on the precautionary measure of suspending the League for Sunday January 2,"" AFP reports. According to Spanish sports newspaper Marca, five first division and ten second division matches would have been affected if the strike was allowed to go ahead. But there will be at least one footballer who will still be taking industrial action: Real Madrid's Royston Drenthe. The Dutch international, who is currently on loan at fellow La Liga club Hercules, has declared he will go on a post-Christmas, one-man strike until he receives what he claims are unpaid wages. ""I haven't been fully paid once since I left Madrid for Hercules. I've received 50% of my monthly wages on two occasions and didn't get paid at all in the other four months,"" he told Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf. ""I have a mortgage and several other bills that need to be paid and I can't accept that Hercules are not paying me.""","A strike called by the union that represents Spain's footballers has been called off .

"Abidjan, Ivory Coast (CNN) -- A three-man West African delegation won't return to Ivory Coast until Monday, when it will ask self-declared President Laurent Gbagbo to relinquish his post or face a military ouster, a representative of the group said Friday. But Gbagbo remained defiant in his claim that he won a November 28 election fairly -- a claim disputed by challenger Alassane Ouattara and a growing international bloc that has recognized him as the winner of the presidential runoff election. Ouattara and Gbagbo, the incumbent, set dueling deadlines for the other to stand down, but neither show any signs of doing so. Charles Ble Goude, a minister in Gbagbo's cabinet, ordered Ouattara out of Abidjan by Saturday. ""If you (Ouattara) don't do it by the first of January, when that day passes, I can no longer be responsible for the security of the people at the Golf Hotel,"" said Charles Ble Goude, a minister in Gbagbo's cabinet, whipping supporters into a frenzy at a rally Wednesday. The Golf Hotel is where Ouattara has been holed up since the election. ""I ask the people of Ivory Coast to be ready with their bare hands to remove Ouattara!"" Ble Goude said. A spokesman for Ouattara said that Ouattara told African leaders at a meeting earlier this week that he was willing to offer Gbagbo amnesty in return for ceding power, setting a midnight Friday deadline. Ouattara set the December 31 deadline thinking that the African leaders representing the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) would return to Ivory Coast on Thursday, said his spokesman, Patrick Achi. The three-man delegation, however, is not set to travel back to Abidjan until Monday, when it will again ask Gbagbo to step down, Nigerian defense spokesman Col. Yerima Mohammed said Friday. Achi said the ECOWAS leaders asked Ouattara to spell out the conditions under which he would be willing to see Gbagbo leave quickly and peacefully. ""He offered to give Gbagbo amnesty and other conditions related to a former head-of-state status but he said that these offers will be only available if former President Gbagbo is ready to recognize that he has lost elections,"" Achi said. Ouattara, said Achi, ""still wants the crisis to be over as quickly as possible"" and hopes it will not extend beyond Monday. If the ECOWAS appeal to Gbabgo fails again, the regional bloc's defense committee will meet in Mali January 17-18 to finalize a military option and then report back to the heads of state, Mohammed said. Military force is a last resort, Mohammed said, adding that it's hoped Gbagbo will step down peacefully. The crisis began when the independent Electoral Commission declared Ouattara the winner of the runoff, followed by the West African nation's Constitutional Council's declaration that Gbagbo was the winner. Meanwhile, in an interview with EuroNews, Gbagbo called for Ouattara to support a recount of the runoff vote and declared there was no reason for him to step aside. ""It must be understood that (the Electoral Commission's declaration) was an illegitimate result which was prematurely declared by a body that had no right to do so,"" he said. ""It's on this point that the west is digging its heels in. After the vote, the Constitutional Council meets and gives the result. It declares who is the elected president, and that was me. It's not open to debate."" Earlier this week, an ECOWAS delegation consisting of Presidents Yayi Boni of Benin, Ernest Bai Koroma of Sierra Leone and Pedro Pires of Cape Verde met with Gbagbo in Abidjan. But their pleas for him to leave office were in vain. Meanwhile, human rights activists grew increasingly concerned about politically motivated violence in Ivory Coast. The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, sent individual letters to ""a group of leaders in key authority positions"" to remind them ""in the strongest terms"" that they will be held ""personally accountable for human rights violations."" ""The international criminal justice system that has developed over the past 15 or so years has given us a tool of accountability we did not have before,"" Pillay said. ""No longer can heads of state, and other actors, be sure that they can commit atrocious violations and get away with it."" The letter was sent to Gbagbo and the commanders of the Ivorian Republican Guard, the marines and security forces. ""We have received reports of at least two mass graves; however, U.N. human rights teams have been denied access to the scenes of these atrocities in order to investigate them,"" Pillay said. ""Denying access to alleged mass grave sites and places where the victims' mortal remains are allegedly deposited constitutes a clear violation of international human rights and humanitarian law."" The U.N. refugee agency said Friday that more than 18,000 refugees have fled the country for neighboring Liberia. In London, British officials informed Philippe D Djangone-Bi, the man sent by Gbagbo as his ambassador to Britain, that he is no longer recognized in the position as of Friday. He immediately loses his diplomatic status, privileges and immunities, the UK Foreign Office said. ""We will be moving to recognize the appointee of President Alassane Ouattara in the usual manner,"" the office said in a statement. Earlier this month, representatives of European Union countries agreed to only accept ambassadors appointed by Ouattara. France is reviewing the credentials of the Ouattara appointee, and Belgium has said it would accept the new president's ambassador. France has renewed its call for citizens -- especially those with children -- to leave Ivory Coast as soon as possible, the French Foreign Ministry said Friday. France last week warned of dangers in the West African nation. ""Although foreigners have not so far been directly threatened, the French authorities renew their advisory to defer plans for trips to Ivory Coast, and to all the French who can ... to temporarily leave Ivory Coast until the situation normalizes,"" the foreign ministry said in a statement Friday. The United States and United Kingdom also have warned their citizens of possible violence. The U.S. State Department has ordered non-emergency personnel and family members to leave Ivory Coast. It also warned U.S. citizens against traveling there. The UK Foreign Office also had advised British citizens to avoid travel to Ivory Coast and, for those already there, to leave the country unless they ""have a pressing reason to remain.""

"Guatemala City, Guatemala (CNN) -- Six people were killed and 17 were injured in a bomb blast onboard a bus in northwestern Guatemala City, officials said. Police on Tuesday were still not sure who set off the bomb or why, though one transportation union leader said that gang members had threatened violence if bus companies did not pay extortions. Initial reports from police on Monday were of four or five people dead, but the number rose to six Tuesday morning, CNN affiliate Noti 7 reported. The injured remained at the hospital, where they were being treated for second- and third-degree burns. A mother and her two children of 11 and 13 years were among those killed, local media reported. Some witnesses told police that a woman came aboard the bus, placed the bag that presumably held the explosive on the luggage rack, and then got off the bus, Noti 7 reported. But authorities added that they are investigating all possibilities. Gamaliel Chan of the bus drivers' union said that his organization had warned authorities of the possibility of an attack because of threats made to them by gang members. The gang members allegedly told the drivers that there would be an attack if they did not pay a Christmas ""bonus."" According to Noti 7, the gang members were asking for 60,000 quetzals from the bus drivers, or about $7,300.
