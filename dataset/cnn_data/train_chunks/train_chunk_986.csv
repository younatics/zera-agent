"Mario Balotelli was the worst player on the pitch in Liverpool's 3-0 defeat by Real Madrid, according to Spanish newspapers AS and Marca. Despite Liverpool's defence being breached three times Balotelli came in for particularly heavy criticism for his performance and was awarded a score of just three out of 10 by Marca, and zero out of three by AS. Considering Brendan Rodgers withdrew the forward at half time, it would appear his manager may have felt the same way. Marca awarded Mario Balotelli a score of just three out of 10 for his performance against Real Madrid . In fact, AS felt that only two Liverpool players were worth ratings of higher than one. Marca were equally scathing of Rodgers' side, awarding Liverpool's defenders scores of no higher than four. The hosts' best player on the night, Marca claimed, was 19-year-old Raheem Sterling. AS (left) awarded the Italian forward a score of zero out of three while Marca (right) were similarly scathing . Simon Mignolet: 5.5 . Glen Johnson: 4.5 . Martin Skrtel: 5 . Dejan Lovren: 5.5 . Alberto Moreno: 5.5 . Jordan Henderson: 5.5 . Steven Gerrard: 5 . Joe Allen: 6 . Raheem Sterling: 6.5 . Mario Balotelli: 4.5 . Philippe Coutinho: 6 . Subs: Adam Lallana 6.6, Lazar Markovic 6, Emre Can 6 . Brendan Rodgers: 6 . The former QPR forward, who has been linked with a move to the Bernabeu, was given a score of six out of 10. Rodgers was rated at four-and-a-half, making him exactly half as impressive as his opposite number, Carlo Ancelotti. French forward Karim Benzema, who scored twice, was declared man of the match with a rating of nine. The former Lyon man scored his side's second and third goals to put the tie out of Liverpool's reach. Cristiano Ronaldo, who netted a sublime opener, and Isco were also rated highly by Marca. The result leaves Rodgers' side in third place in their Champions League group, facing a battle for qualification. Liverpool, Basle and Ludogorets are all on three points, with three games remaining. Balotelli (second left) was off the pace against Real Madrid and was substituted at half-time . Marca's front cover claimed it was 'the night the legendary Anfield stood with its mouth open'","Liverpool lost 3-0 to Real Madrid at Anfield .

"Liverpool will not look to solve their defensive crisis by splashing out more money on new signings in January. Manager Brendan Rodgers and his staff remain perplexed by the defensive performances that have returned just one clean sheet in 18 competitive games. They have spent more than £60million on Dejan Lovren, Mamadou Sakho, Alberto Moreno and Tiago Ilori in the past 18 months and recruited Kolo Toure and Javier Manquillo on a free transfer and loan respectively but the problems are still painfully evident. Liverpool conceded three times against Real Madrid and have kept one clean sheet in last 18 matches . Cristiano Ronaldo forces a save from Simon Mignolet - one of several chances Real had to extend their lead . Martin Skrtel (left) and £20million signing Dejan Lovren have been struggling to forge a strong partnership . Dejan Lovren - £20million (July 2014) Mamadou Sakho - £18m (September 2013) Alberto Moreno - £12m (August 2014) Tiago Ilori - £7m (September 2013) Javier Manquillo - Loan (August 2014) Kolo Toure - Free (July 2013) Rodgers has vowed to work his players harder on the training ground with set pieces a particular Achilles heel. Liverpool's owners have always backed their manager but bringing in more players now would be considered an extra complication. Rodgers is convinced Lovren can prove a key figure but the Croat is struggling to form a solid understanding with Martin Skrtel while Simon Mignolet's confidence in goal is fast diminishing. Liverpool defenders look on along with Ronaldo (centre) as Karim Benzema's header goes into the net . Alberto Moreno (right) is one of a number of players signed in the last 18 months to strength the defence . There will be potential Bosman signings offered to Liverpool in the winter market and they will be considered for the summer but the present intention is to work through their growing crisis. Ilori is on loan at Bordeaux and, while reports continue to be favourable, he is seen as one for the future. Academy graduate Andre Wisdom has impressed at West Bromwich Albion but may struggle to break through at Anfield and Sebastian Coates is on loan at Sunderland but has failed to convince Rodgers in the past and is still troubled by niggling injuries. The one bright spot is the continued development of teenage centre-back Lloyd Jones but Liverpool staff hope it will be their experienced players who can show their mettle in the time of need. Buying their way out of trouble is, for now, not an option.

"Chris Froome’s chances of winning next year’s Tour de France have been enhanced by some key new signings at Team Sky. Sir Dave Brailsford has responded to a difficult 2014 Tour for his team by recruiting highly-rated Czech rider Leo Konig from NE on a two-year, seven figure deal. Nicolas Roche, son of former Tour champion Stephen, has also moved to Sky but the recruitment of 26-year-old Konig is the most significant. Team Sky's Chris Froome struggled during the Tour de France earlier this year . Chris Froome and Sir Dave Brailsford won the Tour de France together for Team Sky in 2013 . Irish rider Nicolas Roche has left Tinkoff-Saxo to join Team Sky . Highly-rated Czech rider Leo Konig has joined Team Sky on a seven-figure deal . Seventh in this year’s Tour and considered both an outstanding climber as well as an excellent TT rider, Konig even has the potential to one day lead the team. But he will join initially as Froome’s chief lieutenant alongside Richie Porte in a bid by Brailsford to secure a third Tour title for Sky. Team Principal Sir Dave Brailsford said: ‘We’ve signed five quality riders for next season and each one of them will help strengthen and enhance the squad. ‘We’ve always set our standards high and been very ambitious with our goals. We want to win the biggest races and constantly improve as a team and these new riders have the proven experience and developing talent to perform now and in the future. ‘We have a strong nucleus of riders at Team Sky and these signings will be excellent additions to the squad. They all bring their own qualities and we’re looking forward to welcoming them to the team and seeing them in action next season.'","British outfit have signed five riders including Nicolas Roche and Leo Konig .

"There was a time not long ago that Europe’s leading clubs – not to mention the agents who worked with them – saw Manchester City as the biggest cash cow in football. Fuelled by new money and eager to go places quickly, City needed to spend quickly and lavishly to get there. City admit now that they made some mistakes. They invested heavily in transfer fees and wages for players that didn’t have the right attitude – such as the Brazilian Robinho – or simply weren’t good enough – such as the former England left-back Wayne Bridge. Five or six years on and, as strange as it sounds, it’s City’s neighbours Manchester United that are facing similar challenges. Having fallen behind rivals such as City and Chelsea last season, the biggest club in England are playing catch-up and that makes them vulnerable. Man United are facing challenges in the transfer market and could be tempted to sign Cristiano Ronaldo . Ronaldo is a club legend having helped United win three Premier League titles during his spell at Old Trafford . A group of Man United fans plan to fly a 'come home Ronaldo' banner over Real Madrid's next game . Man City were seen as football's biggest cash cow not long ago and signed striker Sergio Aguero for £38m . Man City did make mistakes in the transfer market, including the signings of Wayne Bridge and Robinho . The deal United chief executive Ed Woodward recently put together for the Argentinean winger Angel di Maria involved some high numbers. Taking in to account a £60m transfer fee and wages around the £250,000-a-week mark, the total investment is north of £120m over the length of the 26-year-old’s contract. That deal made sense in many ways. United needed to make a statement and Louis van Gaal’s squad needed quality. It satisfied both needs. The subsequent arrival of Radamel Falcao on similar wages for a season’s loan caused eyebrows to be raised at other Barclays Premier League clubs, though. The Colombian has, after all, only recent returned from a serious knee injury. United invested a total of £120m to land Real Madrid wideman Angel di Maria this summer late in the window . United also flexed their financial muscle to sign striker Radamel Falcao on loan from Monaco this season . Many people in English football think that was one big punt too far by Van Gaal and Woodward and perhaps the true worth of that deal will only be measured accurately when we see what Falcao manages to deliver during his time in England. All of this, meanwhile, does bring us to the case of the player most supporters would dearly like to see back at Old Trafford, Cristiano Ronaldo. The emotional appeal of a move for the World Player of the Year is clear. Ronaldo enjoyed some remarkable years at Old Trafford under Sir Alex Ferguson and, at the age of 29, remains at his peak. As has been the case before since he left England for Madrid in 2009, Ronaldo appears to be a little unsettled at the Bernabeu. Once again, though, the numbers do not really make sense. Olf Trafford hero Ronaldo enjoyed many great years at Manchester United with Sir Alex Ferguson . Ronaldo  is congratulated by Gary Neville and Ferguson after winning the Champions League back in 2008 . Ronaldo is understood to be willing to listen to offers after becoming unsettled at Real Madrid . When Ronaldo’s wage demands landed on the desks of executives at Europe’s elite clubs as his representatives endeavoured to engineer a transfer in the summer of 2013, it didn’t take long for the vast majority to look the other day. At upwards of £350,000-a-week, it was just too much. United did get involved, though. Seeking a marquee signing to help David Moyes on his way, tentative negotiations did take place. More than a year on, though, it is hard to see United seriously giving consideration once again to bringing Ronaldo ‘home’ next summer. Those with a good working knowledge of Spanish football firmly believe that Real will look to move Ronaldo on next year. Ronaldo was hawked around Europe’s top clubs last summer before eventually signing a new five-year deal . United, though, are a club that need to address fundamentals rather than chase luxuries. The evidence of this season already tells us that Van Gaal is not short on players who can create and score goals after the heavy spending of the summer. What van Gaal does not have is world class central defenders and that most crucial modern commodity of all, a dominating holding midfield player. In the past United have been accused of lacking ambition in the transfer market. The approach of Ferguson and Woodward’s predecessor David Gill was never to overpay and always to see what they described as ‘value. Because of this, some of Europe’s star names did slip away from them. Man United manager Louis van Gaal has plenty of attacking options but no world-class central defender . Nobody can accuse Van Gaal and Woodward of being slow coming forwards. Their aggressive approach of the last window was perhaps justified simply because of their club’s clear need. A line in the sand will have to be drawn somewhere, however. There is a difference between being positive and ambitious and appearing a little reckless. United need some long-term planning and some pragmatic thinking. Indulging in emotional fantasies will only get you so far in football and that is why a move for Ronaldo next summer just doesn’t really make any sense.","Manchester United have fallen behind rivals such as Chelsea and City .

"Roberto Martinez has no regrets about failing to sign Tom Cleverley as he insisted Everton’s squad will cope with the demands of four competitions. Everton’s manager tried until late on transfer deadline day to negotiate a deal with Manchester United for Cleverley but, in the end, a deal could not be reached and the England international subsequently joined Aston Villa on loan. Martinez had previously experienced a hectic summer window, bringing in five new faces, but he is not concerned that he failed to add Cleverley, as he believes they have the depth to cope with playing in the Europa League and the Barclays Premier League. Everton attempted to sign Tom Cleverely on deadline day but the midfielder ended up joining Aston Villa . Roberto Martinez (left) is confident the Everton squad will be able to cope with the demands of Europe . ‘You always get opportunities on the last day of the window,’ said Martinez, whose side return to action on Saturday against West Brom. ‘I would never be disrespectful of someone not on our books. I thought he could have brought something different but it didn’t work out. ‘I was very pleased that we had the majority of our business done before the final day. We had a couple of opportunities but the final few options, in the end, weren’t quite right for us. ‘We are really happy with numbers and the quality that we have. We have the youth and experience to be competitive with a game every three days. This is quite new for us, coping with a lot of games and a lot of travelling. We want to embrace it and really enjoy it. We will find out a lot about ourselves.’ Everton are still seeking their first win of the fledgling campaign and Martinez, while satisfied with the levels his side have shown in games against Leicester, Arsenal and Chelsea, knows they need to improve defensively. Roberto Martinez signed Samuel Eto'o this summer and is pleased with the quality in the Everton squad . ‘We have been a little bit slack in our defensive duties and we have conceded too many easy goals,’ said Martinez. ‘There may have been a lack of defensive intensity and that is something we will address. But I do see a team that has improved from last season. ‘The performance in the first 45 minutes against Arsenal was as good as it gets. All in all, I am really excited about the potential I have seen. We had 15 clean sheets last season. There is no need for drastic revolution. It is all about small details. We can’t wait to get back to the standards that we have.’ Martinez has injury doubts over Leon Osman (calf) and Samuel Eto’o (groin) for the trips to The Hawthorns. Of the pair, Eto’o is least likely to travel but Martinez expects he will be fit for the Europa League opening game against Wolfsburg. Ross Barkley, meanwhile, is 'making good progress' as he continues his rehabilitation from a medial ligament injury but Everton’s manager believes it will be another four weeks before the England midfielder is ready to return.

"Marouane Fellaini was delighted to score his first goal for Manchester United as he ended his injury hell by helping Louis van Gaal’s side to a point at West Brom. The Belgium international came off the bench early in the second half to score United’s first goal in the 2-2 draw at The Hawthorns. It was his first goal for United following his £27.5million move from Everton last summer and he hopes it will kick start his career at Old Trafford. Marouane Fellaini celebrates his goal against West Brom as United drew 2-2 with West Brom . Speaking to MUTV, Fellaini said: 'It was a good feeling, I have waited for a long time for this moment and now I have scored, so I hope to score some more goals this season.' Fellaini’s career at United has been plagued by injury and he has not yet shown the form from his Everton days. The 26-year-old says he has worked hard to get back to full fitness and believes the best is yet to come from him. Fellaini has also thanked Van Gaal for showing faith in him and vowed to repay him with goals. Fellaini watches his shot go in as he opened his goal account at Manchester United . 'It was very difficult but I work hard every day and I know that when I am 100 per cent fit then I can be dangerous,' Marouane said. 'Football is like this, sometimes you have bad moments and that was one. But I am ready for the challenge and to play every game. I am happy here and the manager has shown trust in me. Every day in training, I work hard and after that the manager makes a decision.' Fellaini stared the game on the bench and came in during the second half and scored . United were forced to come from behind twice against West Brom after Stephane Sessegnon gave the Baggies the lead before Fellaini levelled. Alan Irvine’s side then regained the lead through Saido Berahino before Daley Blind rescued a point late on for United. West Brom caused a stir when their official Twitter account appeared to mock the midfielder as he was warming up. They posted posted: ‘Fellaini has now taken his tracksuit off, fortunately he has a Man Utd strip on underneath #WBAMUN’. However Fellaini scored and after being criticised on social media, West Brom tweeted an apology of sorts: ‘Sorry if a joke about a footballer not having a shirt on under his tracksuit top has caused such outrage. It was not intended as a slur.’","Manchester United midfielder scored first goal since joining club .

"You have to fear for Manchester United with a hurricane on the way. Louis van Gaal’s defence is about as far from being storm-proofed as it’s possible to be after spending more than £160million on home improvements. Daley Blind did manage to scramble a point three minutes from time, but twice West Bromwich Albion led with a reminder that it will take more than a two-week break, another minor tactical tweak and a bold decision to leave out Radamel Falcao to stop United springing leaks. Until they solve such fundamental problems they will remain thrilling to watch but firmly on the outside of the title race. Scroll down for video .

Alan Irvine’s spirited team had only two efforts on target according to the statistics but they gave their visitors a real scare, as first Stephane Sessegnon and then Saido Berahino took advantage of loose defending to beat David de Gea. United recovered and will take certain positives from the night, including Marouane Fellaini’s first goal since his £27.5m move from Everton last year. It could be the initial stage of his rehabilitation from figure of fun to cult hero. There was also Blind’s first since his transfer from Ajax in August and, as it came in the closing moments, a return to United’s never-say-die traditions. And yet, they have not won away from home since April, they have only won three of the first eight Barclays Premier League games and they trail 11 points behind leaders Chelsea. Jose Mourinho’s team are at Old Trafford on Sunday. 'Different cook, as we say in the Netherlands,' said Van Gaal, at The Hawthorns, to a room full of blank stares. 'Different biscuit?' he ventured. Still nothing. 'Different level?'. The Dutch phrase seems to mean Chelsea will provide a far tougher test of United’s progress than anything they have faced to date. After Chelsea, it is a derby against Manchester City. And still Van Gaal tinkers, unable to find the right balance. At The Hawthorns, there was a first start of the season for Adnan Januzaj as the midfield diamond followed the back-three out of the window and United adopted a 4-1-4-1 shape. Blind was deployed as the holding midfielder, although he was unable to stop Sessegnon sweeping Albion into the lead from the area he should have been patrolling. Sessegnon’s movement was intelligent, delaying his charge into the penalty area to elude the centre-halves as Andre Wisdom tore forward from right-back. Luke Shaw had been lured in-field to contest a high ball but Albion won it and Graeme Dorrans released Wisdom. De Gea, who performed heroics to protect the lead against Everton, on the last outing, had no chance and Sessegnon lashed the ball past him from the edge of the box.

Click here for more from our brilliant Match Zone. Shaw seems uncertain when asked to defend in this team, as a far more experienced left-back might. Marcos Rojo, United’s left-sided centre-half, appeared equally as uncomfortable at times, especially when confronted with the direct and intense elements of English football. Albion were quick to launch the ball into Rojo’s airspace and to run at Shaw, too often for it to be a coincidence. Going forward, of course, United were mobile, dangerous and kept Boaz Myhill on his toes. Angel di Maria was the greatest threat in the first half but ran out of steam and came off after gesturing as if he might have a problem with his groin. Myhill, deputising for Ben Foster who was out with a calf injury, denied stand-in skipper Robin van Persie within and then again to frustrate Di Maria twice, in the first half. Albion scrambled around to protect their goal. They defended stoutly, throwing bodies in front of shots, but were helped by wayward finishing, which had United’s chief executive Ed Woodward grumbling in the VIP seats.

The introduction of Fellaini was not the only change Van Gaal made at half-time. His team pressed further up the field after the break, which seemed to help, but encouraged Albion on the break and they went ahead when Chris Brunt unzipped the defence with a pass in the 65th minute. Berahino collected it and the 20-year-old made no mistake, with a lethal finish to celebrate his seventh of the season in all competitions. Again United risked throwing everything forward. Van Persie smacked the foot of the post and Sebastien Pocognoli escaped with a clear handball inside his own penalty area. West Brom’s luck ran out as Blind salvaged a point, seizing on a partial clearance as it rolled out of the penalty area and guided it coolly inside the post.

"Manchester United left it late at the Hawthorns to deny West Brom a famous home win against Louis van Gaal's stuttering side.

Much maligned midfielder Marouane Fellaini came on at the break to score a spectacular equaliser within minutes of the restart.

VIDEO Scroll down to watch post-match reaction from Louis van Gaal and Alan Irvine . WEST BROM (4-2-3-1) Boaz Myhill was making his first appearance in the Premier League since December 2013 on Monday night . Boaz Myhill - 7 . His first Premier League start in 10 months went well. He made a decent save from Van Persie, then twice denied Angel di Maria. No chance with Fellaini’s thunderbolt. Andre Wisdom - 7 . Showed a calm head to pick out Sessegnon for his goal and worked tirelessly up and down the right flank. Not only did he provide an attacking outlet but a solid defensive screen. Craig Dawson - 7 . West Brom rejected two bids from Burnley in the summer and the former England Under 21 international is beginning to show why. From fourth-choice centre back to vital member of the team. Centre back Joleon Lescott failed to prevent Marouane Fellaini scoring at the start of the second-half . Joleon Lescott - 7 . Out-muscled by Fellaini for his goal, but provided plenty more to counter-balance. There were timely interceptions to crosses and a calm authority to his play. Expert organiser too. Sebastien Pocognoli - 6 . Dependable as usual at left-back without doing much spectacular. Has been the only foreign summer signing to feature in Alan Irvine’s team consistently and he does provide balance. Craig Gardner - 7 . Threw himself in front of shots as the minutes ticked down and provided a solid core to West Brom’s team. Restricted his running forward to ensure the hosts maintained their shape. James Morrison - 6 . Did not quite have the impact of recent games, where he has been one of Albion’s best players, but did all the basics well. West Brom midfielder, shielding off Luke Shaw, worked tirelessly for the home side on the right wing . Graham Dorrans - 7.5 . Full of energy and clever link-up play throughout. Prepared to work hard for the cause, which coming from a right winger is priceless. Has turned around his Hawthorns career after being frozen out last season. West Brom striker Stephane Sessegnon celebrates scoring a fine opener after just eight minutes . Stephane Sessegnon - 7 . Stunning strike to set the mood and ensure West Brom had the initiative for most of the match. Sometimes slack in possession but makes up for it when delivering decisive moments. Chris Brunt - 6.5 . Lovely pass with his ‘wrong’ foot to set clear Berahino. The weight and direction were judged precisely and allowed his team-mate the time to compose his thoughts. Such a sweet left foot, too. England U21 star Saido Berahino was once again a nuisance for United, firing West Brom 2-1 up . Saido Berahino - 7 . Growing into his role as Albion’s go-to guy. There was little doubt he would convert when bearing down on De Gea and the finish against a goalkeeper capable of unfathomable saves was inch-perfect. SUBSTITUTES . Youssouf Mulumbu - (86') MANCHESTER UNITED (4-1-4-1) David de Gea - 6 . Had little to do other than pick the ball out of his net. Two shots on target, two goals. Neither one could the Spaniard have done anything about. Rafael - 6 . Not kicked on in the manner that was hoped when he first broke into the United team as a teenager. There are just too many mistakes. Always a willing runner going forwards and a tenacious tackler but he did not shine here. Manchester United defender Phil Jones returned to the side from injury and was kept busy by West Brom . Phil Jones - 6 . The better of United’s centre-halves but that is not saying much. Making his return after six weeks out injured so rustiness may be a problem but displayed little of the authority needed. Marcos Rojo - 5 . Just does not look like a centre-back. Lacks the stature required and on this evidence the knowledge as well. Too often he appeared uncertain and his positing is open to question. Luke Shaw - 5 . At fault for the opening goal. Got sucked into Myhill’s long ball but beaten in the air by Dorrans to leave huge space on the right flank for Wisdom to run into. Better going forward as the game went on. Daley Blind was given the tough task of shielding Manchester United's defence but also managed to score . Daley Blind - 7 . Given the tough task of screening United’s defence against a vibrant Albion attack and looked lost for the opening goal. But redeemed himself in the second half and provided an equaliser of great quality. Ander Herrera - 5.5 . Hooked at half-time and seemingly not fully fit after his rib injury, which he was wearing a corset under his shirt to protect. Pressed high at times but failed to impose himself on the ball. Young winger Adnan Januzaj was given a first start in the league by van Gaal but struggled to impose himself . Adnan Januzaj - 5.5 . Given his first start in the Premier League by Louis Van Gaal, he operated on the right wing as opposed to the central role that had been expected. Glittering moments were scarce, however. Juan Mata - 6 . Failed to get into the game in any meaningful way. Handed his preferred role behind the striker but too frequently his involvement slowed moves down. Possesses magic to turn matches but did not show it here. Angel di Maria was once again a threat for Manchester United, adding a fourth assist to his three goals so far . Angel di Maria - 7 . Subdued for his standards. His cross for Fellaini’s goal was good and there were the usual cracked shot from distance. But substituted before the end to suggest his fitness is not at peak capacity. Robin Van Persie - 6 . Smacked a superb volley into the post to give us a glimpse of the player who won United their 20th league title but in this sole striker role his fading ability is exposed. Needs a partner running off him. Not mobile enough on his own. Fellaini roars in delight after scoring his first league goal for Manchester United to equalise at the Hawthorns . SUBSTITUTES . Marouane Fellaini - 7 . Having made an instant impact off the bench, Fellaini produced a fine goal and put in an industrious display to silence his doubters. Radamel Falcao - (72') 6 .

"Most controversial omission of the night was Anderlecht's Alex Mitrovic. The 20-year-old striker turned up to pre-season training overweight and has struggled for form since, enduring criticism from fans and media. Despite being Anderlecht's record signing, he was dropped to the bench on Wednesday night, rather like Adel Taarabt. Striker Alex Mitrovic was left on the bench by Anderlecht during Wednesday's Champions League clash . Wenger must linger for longer . Arsene Wenger is pretty proud of his 17 consecutive years in the Champions League but he'll have to go some way beyond his 65th birthday to match Anderlecht's run in Europe. This is the 50th consecutive year the Belgian champions have qualified for European competitions. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger celebrated his 65th birthday with a dramatic 2-1 victory in Belgium . The Eurostar Derby? Watford and Luton used to call their matches the M1 Derby based on the ease with which you can travel between the towns thanks to the motorway. So Arsenal v Anderlecht should by rights be the Eurostar Derby, with both clubs located within two miles of the respective stations at Brussels-Midi/Zuid and St Pancras. A throwback to Highbury . Arsenal fans of a certain age would have felt at home at Anderlecht’s Constant Vanden Stock Stadium. Not only was there safe standing for both sets of supporters — something fans want at The Emirates — but the ground is compact with terraced houses and bars adjacent to two sides of the stadium, a throwback to the Highbury days.

"His beanie hat may be slightly askew but Joleon Lescott is talking straight. For the first time since leaving Manchester City last summer he opens up about his disappointment at the manner in which his successful five-year spell ended. Lescott is still confused by decisions made by Roberto Mancini and Manuel Pellegrini to omit him from their line-ups, most crushingly from last season's Capital One Cup final, and how a lack of action hampered his chance of cementing an England place. This is not to suggest he is gloomy. Chatting after training with West Bromwich Albion he is quite the opposite. Lescott is back playing regularly and enjoying the responsibility that comes from being an experienced figure in a side of humbler aspirations. Joleon Lescott is all smiles at training ahead of West Brom's clash against Manchester United . Lescott is an experienced figure within the West Brom changing room and is enjoying the responsibility . After a string of injuries kept him out at the start of this season the West Brom star has impressed . The centre-back is back playing regular football since his move on a free transfer to the Baggies . Lescott is still confused by Roberto Mancini and Manuel Pellegrini's decisions to omit him from their line-ups . The defender began to grow accustomed to being sidelined towards the end of his Manchester City career . He has not given up that desire to play for his country again, either. 'I still feel I could have played more games last season but it wasn't to be,' he says. 'My decision was to go somewhere I could play more regularly and since I have been fit I have done that.' The omens are good for West Brom’s Joleon Lescott on Monday night. It’s almost exactly three years to the day since the defender was in Manchester City’s team as they thrashed local rivals United 6-1 at Old Trafford. Lescott even set up a goal for Edin Dzeko. Knee and calf niggles prohibited his involvement at the start of this campaign but he has been a source of strength in Alan Irvine's team for the past three games. Manchester United provide the opposition on Monday and the prospect of facing Radamel Falcao, Robin van Persie and Angel di Maria is enough to have any defender checking whether the hamstrings feel a bit tight. Not Lescott. He relishes a duel with such adversaries. He was, after all, in the City side that won 6-1 at Old Trafford three years ago this week. Later that season he was also in the defence that secured a 1-0 win over United which had even greater significance. West Brom face Manchester United on Monday and Lescott will relish the prospect of facing Radamel Falcao . If Lescott continues to play well in the lead up to the next England match he is confident he will get a call-up . A fortnight later Lescott lifted the Premier League trophy, having played 31 Premier League matches. He held the trophy again in May but this time after only 10 league appearances. 'I got a medal,' he says. 'It was still really enjoyable, it just didn't feel the same.' It is notable that Lescott's greater frustration came from being left out for the Capital One Cup final. 'I played every minute, captained the semi-final, then not playing (in the final) was the hardest part.' Pellegrini did not explain why Martin Demichelis would be starting instead. 'He just read out the team and my name wasn't there', Lescott remembers. 'We won and then he explained why he didn't pick Joe (Hart). It was because Pantsy (Costel Pantilimon) had played more minutes. I was like, 'If that's the reason for him, why isn't that a reason for me?' That bewilderment can be traced back to the summer after City won their first Premier League title. Lescott played every minute of England's Euro 2012 campaign, scoring against France, but returned to find Mancini questioning his mentality. 'I heard an interview with Roberto Mancini saying I had lost confidence,' recalls Lescott. 'I thought that was strange because we had won the league, I had gone to the Euros, scored, and I didn't think my confidence could get any higher.' The former Manchester City defender has played against some of the best strikers in the world . He went on to play 33 times that season but more frequently from the bench. Pellegrini took over and his trust in Demichelis, despite the Argentine's initial struggles, pushed Lescott further to the sidelines. 'A manager has no allegiance to a player they haven't bought,' says Lescott. 'They think, 'He's from the old team. If I don't pick him, he's not going to be seen as my mistake'.' When it came to moving on, Lescott liked speaking to Hull City manager Steve Bruce but chose Irvine, with whom he worked at Everton. There was no £22million fee this time but there was pressure to perform nonetheless. 'When I was injured I was gutted for him (Irvine),' says Lescott. 'He said, 'Take your time. I don't want you 80 per cent fit sitting on the bench.' That was a weight off my shoulders. Now we're showing what he's been working on in training.' Victories over Tottenham and Burnley preceded a narrow defeat at Liverpool. Lescott believes, at 32, he could get back into the England reckoning if this promising start grows. He was on the bench for a friendly in Brazil last year but has not been in Roy Hodgson's squad since. After victories over Tottenham and Burnley Lescott believes he could get back into the England reckoning . The 32-year-old has won 26 caps for England since his debut in a 3-0 win against Estonia in October 2007 . Gary Cahill and Phil Jagielka have been a regular partnership in Roy Hodgson's England selections . 'After the Euros I got the feeling (Gary) Cahill was going to be the next focal point and it was an opportunity for someone to play alongside him. I felt it was mine to stake a claim but it was stop-start at City. I've only played three games this season (so) for me to say I should be back in the squad would be disrespectful. If I continue to play the same level up to the next international then hopefully I will be closer.' Lescott also offers an interesting analysis of United's defensive troubles. 'Centre halves have to play together as a partnership,' he says. 'Van Persie and Falcao can play off the cuff and win the game. As a defender you can't. I can't suddenly just go into midfield and think, 'That was great' because my mate at the back could be being roasted. Once United get that unit playing regularly they will be fine.' Lescott argues that against United it will be easier to defend because knowing the calibre of the opponent focuses the mind and guards against lapses. 'That side of it will be fun,' he smiles before denying that a repeat of Leicester City's 5-3 victory would be satisfactory — 'Even if we win, I wouldn't be happy conceding three.'","Joleon Lescott speaks openly about his confusion over being left out at Manchester City .

"Boaz Myhill started his first Premier League for 10 months on Monday night after Ben Foster injured his calf in training. It was not exactly a good omen for West Brom. His previous four league matches each ended in defeat. Scroll down for video . Boaz Myhill was making his first appearance in the Premier League since December 2013 on Monday night . Myhill was beaten by Fellaini's excellent strike but did at least break his losing streak in the league . Stephane Sessegnon scored his first Premier League goal of the season - and it was an absolute belter. Registering at a shot speed of 62.1mph, Manchester United goalkeeper was left with no chance as West Brom burst into a surprise ninth minute lead. The goal came from a devastating move, which showed how quickly the Baggies can turn defence into attack. It took just under 11 seconds for the home side to work the ball from Boaz Myhill's gloves to the back of David de Gea's net, as Andre Wisdom showed pace and vision to feed Stephane Sessegnon. The Benin midfielder still had plenty to do when the ball reached him on the edge of the box, but his strike gave De Gea no chance. As opposed to Louis Van Gaal, who instructed his team to play a third different formation of the season, Alan Irvine stuck with the 5-2-3-1 system he has employed throughout this campaign. It was also the same outfield line-up that brought him wins against Tottenham and Burnley. Louis van Gaal's tactical adjustment saw United struggle, but his substitutions seemed to work . Van Gaal remained seated in the dugout the entire 90 minutes, while Irvine stood at the edge of his technical area. Angel Di Maria has had a hand in seven goals in six Premier League appearances. His cross for Marouanne Fellaini’s goal last night was his fourth assist since joining, to go alongside three goals. Angel di Maria was once again a threat for Manchester United, adding a fourth assist to his three goals so far . Adnan Januzaj was named in a Manchester United starting line-up for the first time in the Premier League this season and gave us a look at his new all-white boots.

"A visible sign of the increasing leadership Gareth Bale has for Wales can be observed in the way he called team-mates together for a post-match huddle after clinching a vital win against Cyprus with 10 men on Monday. Captain Ashley Williams did the talking once the bodies assembled but Bale now provides vocal support in the dressing room to add to his ability on the pitch. One day, Williams said, he could ‘definitely’ take over the armband. ‘I have someone next to me now who I can lean on,’ said Williams. ‘That really helps. He is definitely one of the leaders of the team and has grown into it. He has shown he is a leader on and off the pitch. It is not just my advice any more. There are at least two of us. The Wales team held together for a post-match huddle after clinching their vital win against Cyprus . Real Madrid star Gareth Bale lifts his arms in celebration after 10-man Wales clinch the three points . ‘He called the huddle in and I said, “Remember this feeling of tiredness. We left it out there but we got what we came for. We focus now on Belgium.”’ It was a team effort to repel Cyprus for nearly the entire second half, a man down after Andy King’s red card, but Bale was the outlet for breakaways and time-consuming forays into the opponents’ half. Having started as a No 10, he shifted into midfield, then a striking role as the clock ticked down. He took kicks from Cypriot boots. He led by example. The victory means Wales head to Belgium next month top of Group B, and should have Aaron Ramsey, a former captain, back from a hamstring problem. Given he is one of 12 players injured, the boost would be sizeable. He scored a late equaliser in Belgium last October as Wales, depleted by 15 injuries, finished the campaign on a positive note. Manager Chris Coleman would take the same result again. ‘If we are going to do well in this campaign we have to go to Belgium and get a result,’ he said. ‘We are good enough to do that. I don’t know who is going to turn up, there are always injuries. Wales captain Ashley Williams hugs David Cotterill after the latter opened the scoring on Monday night . ‘All I know is whoever we have got we can get a result in Belgium. I am not saying it flippantly, we did it last time when we had 15 players missing.’ When Bale is in your ranks, the odds on achieving a result grow markedly. Ryan Giggs has called him ‘one of the best ever’ players produced by Wales. ‘He can be as good as he wants to be because he’s such an amazing talent. He can go all the way,’ said Giggs. ‘He’s playing at a great club and he’s doing it week in week out and for Wales as well. He has to deliver at Real Madrid where the expectation is huge and he’s showing for Wales he can still deliver. ‘You don’t want to big him up too much but he’s looking like he can handle it all. He’s lived up to every expectation and more. ‘Not only that, he’s a great lad who wants to get better and wants to be the best.’ Giggs also believes Euro 2016 qualification is attainable for Wales. ‘There’s a long way to go but there is great potential,’ he added. ‘We have Gareth who is just a world class player who could walk into any team. There’s Aaron Ramsey and younger players coming through, and I think we can look forward to the rest of the campaign.’ Ryan Giggs on Bale: ‘You don’t want to big him up too much but he’s looking like he can handle it all'","Gareth Bale calls huddle together after Wales beat Cyprus 2-1 .

"West Brom travel to Bournemouth next... CLICK HERE for the rest of the Last 16 draw . Not quite gone in 60 seconds, but that is what this dramatic late turnaround felt like to those in attendance. Two goals for West Bromwich Albion in quick succession snatched this match away from Hull as the final whistle approached and showed the Capital One Cup is perhaps a competition worth fighting for. The plaudits go to Saido Berahino, who scored the winner two minutes from time and is fast becoming a crucial figure for boss Alan Irvine. The England Under 21 forward came off the bench to finish Silvestre Varela’s clever pass from a tight angle. Just one minute and 41 seconds earlier Gareth McAuley had rescued what looked a lost cause by connecting sweetly with a half-volley after Hull failed to clear a corner. Saido Berahino scores a late winner to send West Brom into the last 16 of the Capital One Cup with a 3-2 victory over Hull City . Brown Ideye (centre) beats Hull's David Meyler to the ball to open the scoring for the Baggies in the third round clash .

Subs not used: Huddlestone, Hernandez, Jakupovic, Jelavic. Booked: Bruce. Scorers: Ince 41', Brady 50' Man of the match: Sebastian Blanco. Referee: Phil Dowd 7. Steve Bruce criticised his players for failing to hold on to a lead for the fourth time this season, after dropped points against Newcastle, West Ham and Stoke. ‘It’s a huge concern for me because it’s not like us,’ Bruce said. ‘There is a frustration and disappointment etched on every one of us. ‘We were so comfortable then we don’t defend a corner and all of a sudden they are level. The third one is a lack of concentration.’ For Irvine, things are looking up. This victory came four days after his first in charge of West Brom in the shock at Tottenham. ‘I thought we deserved it,’ he said. ‘We kept going and created chances. I’ve felt things were getting better in recent weeks with more players back to the level of fitness we need.’ The only aspect to concern Irvine was an ankle injury to Brown Ideye, sustained as the club-record £10million striker netted his first goal for the club. ‘Bittersweet,’ is how Irvine described the moment Ideye scored, following up Sebastian Blanco’s saved header from two yards, but he got a kick from David Meyler in the 15th minute. It had looked like Hatem Ben Arfa would steal the show with his assist for what seemed like Robbie Brady’s winner five minutes after the interval. Darting into space outside the box, Ben Arfa played a through ball with his left boot that split West Brom’s defenders so Brady could slot past Boaz Myhill. West Brom and Hull both made 11 changes from their last line-ups as Irvine and Bruce made their priorities clear. Ben Arfa, on his first Hull start, was handed a free role behind Yannick Sagbo, and there were recalls for Tom Ince, James Chester and Alex Bruce. Irvine handed a full debut to Blanco, the Argentine winger on loan from Metalist Kharkiv, and gave academy graduate Liam O’Neil, 21, his first start for the club. Victor Anichebe partnered fellow Nigerian Ideye up front. Ideye has not experienced the kind of introduction to English football for which Albion supporters might have hoped, but Irvine believes his goal here will boost confidence. Hull levelled out of the blue four minutes before half-time. Sagbo picked out Brady on the left and his low cross travelled far into the West Brom box before Ince arrived to ram a finish past Myhill. It was the midfielder’s first goal for Hull since his summer move but his night turned sour in a dramatic finish. PS.

"Gareth Bale's back. Usually words to hearten Wales manager Chris Coleman as his outstanding talent returns from Spain. On Sunday they caused him to accentuate the difference between playing at risk and playing in pain. The world's most expensive footballer will start against Cyprus on Monday night in the hugely important Euro 2016 qualifier, but he does so nursing a sore back. Back among the goals is where Wales want him and Coleman made it clear Bale is always eager to perform for his country no matter what niggles he may be carrying. Gareth Bale (left) trains with his Wales team-mates as the Cardiff City Stadium on Sunday . The Real Madrid forward (centre) will play through a back injury against Cyprus on Monday evening . Wales manager Chris Coleman has admitted Bale is not playing at '100 per cent' at present . Cyprus vs Wales probable teams . But he also stressed, in case Carlo Ancelotti was listening, that there is no danger of worsening the problem. 'He's not playing for us every time at 100 per cent,' admitted Coleman. 'There's a protocol between Real Madrid's medical team and ours but we've never risked him. 'The last thing we want to do is send him back injured. But if there's not a big risk, if there's a chance of getting through the game in a little bit of pain, that's all right. 'That's that attitude which gets you team spirit and trusting each other. It's happening more and more, the lads are playing with knocks and niggles.' The winces will be worth it if they lead to a win, and Bale has shown that desire for Wales. He came to the touchline during the Bosnia draw after taking a knock to his back to speak to Wales's medical team but continued and almost won three points with a stunning drive. His significance to the team is evident in Coleman's telling of that episode, which was delivered with tongue in cheek, Real should note. 'He had a kick but he's all right,' said Coleman. 'In the game the other night he came to the side but whatever he was saying my ears were closed because if there was an issue he wasn't coming off. We gave him treatment, he had a bit of strapping but he's fine.' Coleman insists that he has never risked Bale's fitness and will not do so against Cyprus . Bale tries to get away from Muhamed Besic (right) during Wales' 0-0 draw with Bosnia-Herzegovina . Wales are down to the 'bare bones' in Coleman's words, with Jonny Williams forced out with an ankle injury sustained in heavy challenges on Friday night. Midfield is already missing Aaron Ramsey, Joe Allen and three others — meaning a switch in formation to incorporate Hal Robson-Kanu out wide is likely. Bale should continue up front alongside Simon Church. This is a match Wales must win if they are to hold realistic ambitions of qualifying, which means another goalless draw would underwhelm. Ashley Williams had a glorious chance to win the Bosnia game, but headed over from Bale's cross with 12 minutes left. The captain said is still 'kicking' himself. But he make amends with another solid defensive display. If there is a victory, you can expect another huddle like the one against Bosnia. 'It shows how together we are,' he said. 'We are a tight group and we get on a lot better now than teams gone past.' Hal Robson-Kanu is likely to come into Wales' starting XI against Cyprus in a wide position .

"Chris Coleman has told his Wales team it is time to deliver where he and others failed and live up to a reputation for being the country’s golden generation. The national manager was in buoyant mood ahead of Bosnia’s visit to what should be a near-capacity Cardiff City Stadium on Friday night, and did not play down the magnitude of this opportunity for Wales to reach their first major tournament since 1958. Coleman was part of a glittering era himself, when the likes of Neville Southall, Mark Hughes, Ian Rush, and Ryan Giggs could appear in the same line-up — but never made it past qualifying rounds for World Cups or European Championships. Chris Coleman speaks to the media ahead of Wales' fixture against Bosnia on Friday night . Wales manager Chris Coleman (right) talks with his coaching staff in Cardiff ahead of hosting Bosnia . Gareth Bale looked relaxed in training for Wales ahead of their European Championship qualifying matches . Now there is another impressive collection of talent, spearheaded of course by Gareth Bale, and a better chance than ever before due to the expansion of the tournament. Bosnia are the visitors on Friday night, followed by Cyprus on Monday, and Coleman believes this is the long weekend when Wales can show their character and make a move in Group B, having beaten Andorra in their opening game. ‘They have a great chance to live up to the tag they have been given as the golden generation,’ said Coleman, who made his Wales debut in 1992. ‘I thought the first Welsh team I played in was the golden generation, with Neville Southall, Mark Hughes, Ian Rush, Dean Saunders, Gary Speed and Ryan Giggs. What a team that was, but we did not do it. Chris Coleman made 36 appearances for Wales between 1992 and 2002 . Ryan Giggs of Wales celebrates scoring for Wales against Northern Ireland in 2005 . ‘These boys have also been handed that label, and they will live up to it if they do the business. ‘It is awful when you are part of an international outfit that gets so close and you don’t do it. I don’t want that again, I want to be part of a team that does something no-one else has.’ Injuries to Aaron Ramsey and Joe Allen have dulled the golden sheen somewhat, and further withdrawals by David Vaughan, Andrew Crofts and Lee Evans have left midfield looking thin. It may mean Coleman persists with his 5-3-2 formation to get Tottenham’s Ben Davies and Swansea’s Neil Taylor into the side, with captain Ashley Williams, Hull’s James Chester and Chris Gunter, winning his 56th cap, offering a solid backline. Swansea defender Ashley Williams, Wales' captain, jokes around in training as the squad prepare in Cardiff . Gareth Bale wasn't scared to get stuck into training as the depleted Wales squad was put through their paces . Bale should be given a central role again, having scored a brace in Andorra. He now has 14 Wales goals and needs only two to surpass the great John Charles, and three to better Hughes. Rush, the top Welsh scorer, has 28 but is within range for a player still only 25. Almost 30,000 fans are expected in Cardiff — the biggest crowd since England arrived at the Millenium Stadium in 2011. ‘They wouldn’t come if they didn’t think we had a chance of doing well,’ said Coleman. Bosnia, despite boasting Edin Dzeko, Asmir Begovic, and Roma’s Miralem Pjanic, lost 2-1 to Cyprus in their opening match and Williams wants Wales to turn the screw. ‘We know it is important,’ said the Swansea defender. ‘They are a strong side.

White Stripes, Seven Nation Army. I listen before games, songs to get you pumping. Last film you saw? The Inbetweeners 2. It was good. Stupid humour. Last book you read? Barca by Graham Hunter. I enjoyed getting an insight into what it was like being part of the most successful team in the world. Which three people would you invite for dinner? Oliver Kahn, Muhammad Ali and Tom Brady, quarterback for the New England Patriots. I would love to pick their brains about what they’ve been through and what it’s taken to get to the top.

I was beside the pool chilling out as he rocked the beats. The Balearic island of Ibiza is Begovic's ideal holiday destination - seeing David Guetta there was a highlight . In a film of your life, who would YOU like to play you? Mark Wahlberg. He has that fighting character I relate to. What’s the most expensive thing you’ve ever bought?

"Arsene Wenger could see the question coming just as clearly as Danny Welbeck was able to watch Mesut Ozil’s cross onto his boot for his first goal in an Arsenal shirt. Can similarities be drawn from the way Wenger re-invigorated the career of Thierry Henry and that of the player bought from Manchester United for £16million on transfer deadline day? ‘Give me some time,’ Wenger smiled as he enjoyed his team’s 3-0 victory at Villa Park. ‘It is a bit early to say that when you look at the number of goals Thierry Henry scored. Danny Welbeck opens his account for Arsenal in their 3-0 victory over Aston Villa . Arsenal fans will be hoping that Welbeck follows in the footsteps of Gunners legend Thierry Henry . ‘I think he has an interesting potential and let’s see how he develops. He has a good mentality, good physical potential, good technical potential. ‘He contributes to our team play because he doesn’t lose the ball up front and those are important qualities.’ Henry was a striker, about to turn 22, struggling on the wing at Juventus before arriving in north London and getting the centre forward role he desired. Welbeck is 23 and left Old Trafford because opportunities up front were so limited. ‘Yes, he is a good act to follow, you know. I have nothing against it,’ Wenger agreed. Welbeck celebrates with Mesut Ozil after setting the German up for Arsenal's first goal . Clearly one sound finish does not an Henry make. The Frenchman scored 226 goals, won two Premier League titles and earned numerous individual accolades as the talisman of Arsenal’s team in the early 2000s. But the signs were encouraging as Welbeck started his third game in succession as the sole striker. Never in his time at United was he entrusted in such manner. Against Manchester City and Borussia Dortmund, Welbeck missed two excellent chances from similar positions – hitting the post and dragging a shot just wide – but Wenger made the point that by being given a run his confidence and accuracy would improve. Besides, he is happy his last-minute purchase is getting scoring opportunities at all. It took Henry eight games before he found his first Arsenal goal. Welbeck has the athleticism and pace that can stretch defences in the way Henry did and also possesses the touch you would expect from a player brought up through United’s academy. His pass for Ozil’s opening goal was one the German would have been proud of himself, slicing the ball between Ciaran Clark and Philippe Senderos with perfect weight. (An Aly Cissokho own goal was the third scored in three minutes and 15 seconds.) Arsene Wenger converted Thierry Henry into Arsenal's greatest ever goal scorer . The area Welbeck can improve comes with his decision-making when given time to think about a finish, as that chipped shot when through on Manuel Neuer against Bayern Munich last season illustrated. It is why Louis Van Gaal said Welbeck’s scoring statistics were not up to the standard expected at United. Wenger described how he must gain that instinctive knowledge for where to place a finish and challenged his striker to adopt an ‘animalistic’ temperament. ‘I think it is not a question of potential it is more a nervous problem because in training he scores goals like a real striker,’ Wenger explained. ‘He rushed a bit his finishing until now maybe because he didn't score. ‘He has played at Manchester United in the position wide for the last two or three years, never through the middle. You lose a little bit that instinct to score and as well that pressure which is a little animalistic to score. 'You need to always be in the middle and wait for your chance to kill the opponent. On the flank you have less of that responsibility. ‘He was not soft. He did a different job, he worked up and down and provided for others. Selfish is a word I don’t like. I like a striker who gives the ball when he has to give the ball and scores when he can score. The fact he can provide and can score for me is very important.’ Arsene Wenger gets a warm welcome from Aston Villa's mascot ahead of their Premier League clash . That link-up play is what makes Welbeck’s fee seem so reasonable and were he to get 20 goals this season his price would be regarded as a bargain. That remains to be seen, of course, and when Olivier Giroud returns from injury Wenger will have a decision to make. This is the time Welbeck needs to make his mark. He is predicting better things to come. ‘I’ve not really had much time to get together with the boys and have many training sessions,’ said Welbeck. ‘Once I carry on training much more and get into the matches I will develop a much better understanding with the players. That instinctiveness will come.’","Welbeck scored a goal and provided another in the 3-0 win at Aston Villa .

"If in May you had told Aston Villa supporters their team would head into the fifth match of this season unbeaten and standing second in the Barclays Premier League there is a good chance the men in white coats would have got a nod. Owner Randy Lerner had cast a cloak of uncertainty over the club by putting it up for sale, manager Paul Lambert was under pressure from fans restless after another campaign flirting with relegation, and star striker Christian Benteke had ruptured his Achilles tendon. But football has a way of making the unfathomable happen and in the space of one productive summer, Villa can suddenly embrace positivity again. It is they, after their best start since the 1998-99 season, who look down on Arsenal, Saturday's visitors. Gabby Agbonlahor wheels away after scoring the winner against Liverpool that took Aston Villa second . Paul Lambert has managed to turn around the club's fortunes after two struggling seasons at Villa Park . There is reason to keep the optimism cautious of course, the season is young, but it is worth examining how Lambert has altered the atmosphere of the club in such a short space of time. The 1-0 win at Liverpool last weekend gave credibility to previous victories over Stoke and Hull, alongside the draw with Newcastle. It was a performance built on defensive foundations and tactical clarity. Clearly, the backline is more secure than previously. Philippe Senderos may not have been a signing to inspire but he has brought organisational skills and experience to the extent that with Ron Vlaar missing at Anfield Nathan Baker, criticised last term, slotted in effectively. Alan Hutton has been recalled from his two-year exile because finances meant Lambert could defuse his ‘Bomb Squad’ and the Scottish international has been a revelation. Aly Cissokho on the opposite flank has strengthened further. Lambert has raised the average age of the back four from 25 last season to 28.5 this. Philippe Senderos (L) and Natthan Baker (C) have brought a sense of solidity to Villa's backline . Alan Hutton (C) has been a revelation since being brought back in from the wilderness by Lambert . His midfield trio is made up of energetic players quick to close spaces. Fabian Delph has flourished, Ashley Westwood is in the form of his career, and Kieran Richardson brings nous. Tom Cleverley adds further quality. Average possession stands at only 37 per cent and passing success just 72 per cent but as Jose Mourinho, or even Jurgen Klopp, will tell you, it is what a team does with the ball that counts. Goalkeeper Brad Guzan has only faced 10 shots so far, second only to Asmir Begovic at Stoke (6), and has reacted when tested. ‘They look very assured,’ former Villa and England manager Graham Taylor told Sportsmail. ‘It would appear to me they’ve said let’s get it right at the back, let’s have a good base.’ Fabian Delph's performances in midfield have earned him a first cal-up from England boss Roy Hodgson . Tom Cleverley (R)  chases down Mario Balotelli, the Aston Villa loanee is determined to prove doubters wrong . From there Villa have been clinical in attack, remarkably gaining ten points from just six shots on target – the lowest in the division. Four goals have been scored, two each for Gabriel Agbonalhor and Andi Weimann. Aston Villa have made their best start to the Premier League season since 1998-99... 16 Aug     Stoke City (A)        0-1 . 23 Aug     Newcastle (H)        0-0 . 31 Aug     Hull City (H)           2-1 . 13 Sep     Liverpool (A)         1-0 . Those slender margins cannot continue to prove so fruitful, as Taylor points out, but Benteke has this week returned to training and could push for a place in the squad within a month. His impact would instantly give Villa an added edge. The recurring name uttered by those associated with the club when asked about Villa’s upturn however belongs to the man Lambert boldly brought in as his No 2. Roy Keane is said to have impressed everyone at the club with his manner, communication skills and driven attitude. Promising winger Jack Grealish, 19, describes Keane as ‘brilliant’ and tells an illuminating anecdote about his first day of training. ‘I didn’t start the session that well and he tapped me on the shoulder after a half an hour,’ recalls Grealish. ‘He said: “Are you alright?” and I replied “Yeah”. And then he asked me: “When do you start training then?”’ Roy Keane (R) stands shoulder to shoulder with Brendan Rodgers... bringing his usual winning mentality . Lambert had no doubts that his close friend Keane would thrive outside of the television studio . Keane has the minerals and the medals to offer players honest appraisals no matter their status and his ferocious winning mentality has permeated the side. Lambert admitted Keane’s appointment following the dismissal of disliked Ian Culverhouse ‘raised eyebrows’ but added: ‘His knowledge meant he was too good to be a TV pundit. I love working with him, we have a laugh. I beat him at the crossbar challenge nearly every day.’ Lambert this week signed a new contract keeping him at Villa until at least June 2018 to allay any doubts about his role beyond next summer and it is clear he shares a strong bond with Lerner. ‘I don’t have an agent,’ says Lambert. ‘I trust him. That’s the big thing. There were never any complications.’ In the window Lambert took on extra responsibilities as chief executive Paul Faulkner surprisingly left. Lambert dealt with a number of deals in and out of the club but new chief executive Tom Fox, recruited from Arsenal, will now take the reigns. Christian Benteke is close to returning from injury and could feature against Arsenal on Saturday . US Owner Randy Lerner (L) has been re-energised and seems less enthusiastic about selling the club . His arrival, and the contracts for Lambert, Hutton and Agbonlahor, indicate Lerner is planning for the long-term even with the ‘For Sale’ sign swinging in the breeze. That should warm the hearts of Villa fans as much as anything. The American has visited Bodymoor Heath on numerous occasions in the past few months and held meetings with all department heads. Re-energised, is the buzzword used to describe him. So too are the club’s faithful, who will push Villa Park close to capacity today. Finally they have cause to be cheerful.","Aston Villa are second in the Premier League table ahead of Arsenal clash .

"Gareth Bale had just performed his latest act of heroism in a football shirt, dragging Wales back from the brink of embarrassment in Andorra with a brace of supreme quality, when he straight away switched his focus to making history. Qualification for Euro 2016 is in his sights now, a first major tournament for Wales since the 1958 World Cup. Plenty of illustrious predecessors have tried and failed, but Bale is displaying the bloody-mindedness required to succeed. ‘We’ve got one ticked off the list and we have nine more to go,’ he said of the Andorra win and Group B matches to come against Belgium, Bosnia, Cyprus and Israel. Gareth Bale is intent on helping Wales reach the European Championships in France in 2016 . Bale scored twice as the Welsh narrowly snuck past lowly Andorra on Tuesday night . ‘I’ve had a taster of the big nights with Madrid. It’s great to get experience of the highest level of club competition and hopefully I can help us qualify for a major tournament.’ If any further evidence was required of how much Wales means to the world’s most expensive player, this was it. He produced a match-winning performance inside a stadium holding just 3,300 people in the remote principality in the Pyrenees. He played the full 90 minutes as if it was his last, driving forward until the unthinkable defeat was fully overturned. ‘The biggest honour you can have is to play for your country and to see the fans turn out like that for an away game was special,’ Bale said. ‘I don’t think many countries could do that. ‘I’ve had some great nights with my club side but I’m looking forward to our next games in the campaign and hopefully we can get that qualification and have success with Wales too.’ The winger says he is used to the big nights after helping Real Madrid to a Champions League final win . Gareth Bale strikes a free-kick on the dodgy pitch in Andorra . Bale’s two goals took his total to 14 in 45 caps. Ian Rush’s record total of 28 looks under threat. Up next in October are matches in Bale’s home town of Cardiff against Bosnia and Cyprus. ‘The next two home games will be key for us,’ said Bale. His two-goal display was all the more impressive given that he produced it on a terrible artificial surface. His team-mate Aaron Ramsey hit out at the pitch that has left him fighting for fitness ahead of Arsenal’s key clash with Manchester City on Saturday. The midfielder suffered an injury to his right ankle after falling awkwardly on the 3G surface. The new pitch was certified by UEFA only last week . Bale tries to calm down the fans after they rushed onto the pitch following his dramatic winner . Aaron Ramsey is a doubt for Arsenal's game against Manchester City after rolling his ankle on the surface . ‘The pitch was very hard, there was no give,’ said Ramsey. ‘I rolled my ankle late on. I could feel it. I hope I’ll be available for Saturday. Manchester City at home, those are the games you want to play.’ ‘I just don’t know how you’re meant to play football on that pitch. It was very frustrating, you couldn’t play the ball quickly. It was very difficult. ‘We couldn’t get into our stride. Normally we play quick, keep it on the floor, play around teams. We couldn’t do that, we had to take the extra touch. I hope that’s the last time I play on a plastic pitch.’","Bale scored twice as Wales beat Andorra 2-1 on Tuesday night .

"Steve Bruce tore into his ‘lifeless’ players after watching his side get picked apart by an Aston Villa team now adding attacking verve to defensive resilience. The Hull manager was infuriated by what he called the worst performance he has overseen and said it was a wake-up call to a squad perhaps still basking in praise earned last campaign. Do not be misled by the slender margin of victory. Paul Lambert’s side deserved all three points from their first-half show alone, in which Gabriel Agbonlahor and Andi Weimann scored the decisive goals.Those were the second and third shots on target for Villa this season, following a 1-0 win at Stoke and goalless draw with Newcastle, moving the team into the Champions League places. Not even Lambert expects Villa to remain there, but promising signs abound. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Steve Bruce admit the first-half performance was the worst since he has been in charge at the club . Turn and shoot: Aston Villa's Gabriel Agbonlahor celebrates the opening goal against Hull at Villa Park . Aston Villa 4-3-3: Guzan 7; Hutton 6, Senderos 7, Vlaar 7, Cissokho 6; Richardson 7 (Grealish 75’ 6.5), Westwood 7, Delph 7.5; N’Zogbia 7 (Sanchez 64’ 6), Agbonlahor 8 (Bent 85’), Weimann 7.5 .

Booked: Davies, Jelavic, Elmohamady, McShane . Manager: Steve Bruce 6.5 . Referee: Mark Clattenburg 7 . Man of the match: Agbonlahor . The summer’s transfer recruitment, with the potential for Tom Cleverley to join today, and owner Randy Lerner’s increased impetus into affairs despite putting the club up for sale, presents the feeling this is a new dawn. It certainly seems that way for Lambert, who was serenaded by the home crowd and happily obliged calls for a wave. This fixture in May was the one that saw Villa win to confirm their safety amid much uncertainty, coming weeks after Lambert was abused by his own fans during a loss at Crystal Palace. The attendance at Villa Park was only 28,336, the lowest for some time, but in the first 45 minutes they were treated to an exhibition of positive football built on pace, high pressing and precise passing. Fabian Delph showed why he has been called up to the England squad by Roy Hodgson. Hull, by contrast, were ineffective and sloppy. Captain Curtis Davies was hooked at half-time. They did rouse themselves late on and with 16 minutes to go Nikica Jelavic claimed his second goal in as many games. But Bruce was still livid post-match after delivering a half-time team talk he described as ‘unrepeatable’. ‘That was arguably the worst I’ve seen us perform in a first half in my two years here,’ he said. ‘I won’t accept it, a performance where we were so lifeless it was incredible. ‘We didn’t get above a jog, so how do you expect to win a Premier League game? We have got 12 going away on international duty. Mind you, keep playing like that and they won’t be internationals. ‘Davies was not injured. Whether he’s the captain or not, he didn’t perform to the level I expect of him, he was a shadow of himself.’ Bruce was happy to announce the club-record £10million signing of Uruguay international striker Abel Hernandez was complete. Lambert, meanwhile, heaped praise on his players. ‘First half we were outstanding,’ he said. ‘I think Gabby was unplayable. His running power and speed was excellent. I thought the movement through midfield was terrific. It has been a great start and hopefully we can keep it going.’ HOW FABIAN DELPH, GABRIEL AGBONLAHOR AND KIERAN RICHARDSON SET UP ANDREAS WEIMANN'S GOAL. CLICK HERE FOR OUR BRILLIANT MATCH ZONE .

Brad Guzan became the eighth Aston Villa player to be booked this season — more than any other Premier League team. Both Villa goals followed the same pattern, originating from Hull’s defence conceding possession and ending with quick passing moves neatly finished. For the first in the 14th minute, Andrew Robertson’s ball forward was poached by Philippe Senderos, who gave possession to Charles N’Zogbia. He found Delph, who found Weimann and his cute pass led to Agbonlahor turning and shooting in one swift movement. For the second, nine minutes before the interval, it was Michael Dawson, on his Hull debut after a £6m move from Tottenham, with an errant pass. Delph intercepted and gave it to Agbonlahor, who found Kieran Richardson advancing fast and his cut-back was controlled and finished calmly by Weimann. The second half was meandering along with Villa in control until 16 minutes from time when a Hull goal from nowhere — Jelavic nodding in Robbie Brady’s free-kick via a heavy deflection off Aly Cissokho — sparked the contest into life. It was the first time Lambert’s defence had been breached in 254 minutes. Villa ended the match with 10 men as captain Ron Vlaar limped off with a calf injury and all Lambert’s substitutes used, but they held firm.

"The Premier League and Sky Sports have been warned the number of away fans attending evening games will begin to dwindle unless action is taken, as it emerged that not one of December’s rearranged fixtures for Monday Night Football is possible to get back from via public transport. Four games have been moved to 8pm kick-offs on a Monday but travelling supporters from Manchester, London, and Swansea will not be able to use trains to return home at full-time unless they stay over until the next morning. Malcolm Clarke, chair of the Football Supporters’ Federation, criticised the Premier League and Sky over the scheduling and revealed his group had pressed the broadcaster on the issue earlier this year and would be doing so again in light of developments. Liverpool vs Swansea at Anfield is one of the games which has been moved to Monday night for Sky Sports . Chair of the Football Supporters' Federation Malcolm Clarke thinks it could see attendances drop . The four matches concerned are Manchester United’s trip to Southampton on December 8, Queens Park Rangers facing Everton at Goodison a week later, Chelsea visiting Stoke on December 22, and Swansea taking on Liverpool at Anfield two days before New Year’s Eve. Alan Lewis, chair of Swansea City Supporters’ Trust, said there was ‘sufficient evidence to suggest travelling fans are not really considered when the fixtures are changed’. There was also a backlash on Twitter, with Chelsea fan William McIntyre writing: . ‘Stoke away moved to a Monday night, 3 days before Christmas. Thank you very much Sky, always putting the fans first....’ Phil Blanco, a Manchester United supporter, posted: ‘Southampton away 8pm on a Monday night. Consideration given to travelling fans there eh Sky?’ Manchester United supporter Phil Blanco was less than complimentary . His team will travel to take on Southampton on a Monday night, presenting a transport conundrum for fans . Sky and the Premier League insist away crowds are factored into discussions but stressed that the complicated formula for compiling fixture lists made it difficult for televised evening games to always allow public transport. Any games changed for television purposes are announced six weeks in advance to allow time for plans to be made. There is also a £200,000 pot available to each club to help travelling fans, which Chelsea partly used for their Monday night game at Burnley to put on return coaches and trains for just £10. Manchester United’s £200,000 allocation has however already been allocated by cutting every away ticket by £5 per fan per match. However, Clarke believes that ultimately fewer supporters will show up to matches if the organisers continue to make it impracticable on public routes. ‘We did actually meet Sky some months ago and made the point about the need to consider away supporters and so it will disappointing if we don’t see some improvement in that, if the problem still persists,’ he told Sportsmail. Chelsea play Stoke on a Monday three days before Christmas - and won't be able to return on public transport . QPR's trip to Everton in December is one of many to be criticised after being moved to a Monday night . ‘It’s in everybody’s interests that there is a vibrant away support because the atmosphere is one of the things that makes it an attractive television product. If you have a half-empty away end because supporters can’t get back home – they’ ve decided to watch it in the local pub instead – that’s not in the long-term interests of the Premier League, Sky, or the match-going supporters. ‘We accept it’s a complex business but nevertheless we think that the interests of away supporters should be fairly high up on the list of criteria when games are chosen to switch. ‘The big danger for the football industry is that fans will simply say, “I won’ t go.” I’ve no doubt we will seek a follow-up meeting with Sky to review what’ s happened and take up some of these issues.’ On Swansea’s match at Liverpool, some 300 miles away on an eight hour round-trip, Lewis said some supporters would be deterred from travelling on a Monday night. ‘The difficulty is getting back from the game,’ he said. ‘Even the official transport that goes up will probably be getting home in the early hours of the morning. ‘The bottom line is that a lot of fans who would have gone to a three o’clock Saturday match will not now travel. Hopefully there will still be a good following. ‘There are sufficient examples to suggest travelling fans are not really considered when the fixtures are changed. I recall a match two seasons ago where we played Sunderland away on a Tuesday night. ‘It’s unfortunate because people try to get cheaper train fares in advance and when things are moved it causes problems.’ BT Sport (pictured here is pundit Michael Owen) have been criticised for their fixture scheduling with Sky . BT Sport have two evening games in December but they are during the midweek when night fixtures were scheduled to take place in any case. Liverpool’s trip to Leicester on December 2 is impossible to get back from the same night using public transport but Southampton’s visit to Arsenal has frequent trains running up until midnight without changes, available at reasonable cost. A spokesman for BT Sport said: ‘Fixture scheduling is a complex process involving multiple parties - clubs, broadcasters, police and local authorities - and all sign off match selections. We always strive to balance local and fan needs alongside the need to schedule games for the benefit of our viewers.’","The Premier League and Sky Sports have been warned attendances will dwindle if they don't take fans into consideration .

"Paul Lambert has told exciting young winger Jack Grealish that Aston Villa is the ideal place to progress his career as contract talks progress amid interest from Chelsea. Grealish, who turned 19 this month, has made a promising start to life in the Villa first team this season with three appearances off the bench in the Premier League, but his current deal runs out next summer. The lifelong Villa fan, who joined the club aged six and is rated very highly, has spoken of his intentions to stay at the club and a four-year contract is on the table. Jack Grealish (R) has been told he will get more first team chances by staying at Aston Villa . The teenager has been attracting admiring glances from Premier League leaders Chelsea . ‘This is the best place to be because he’s getting the chance to get round and about our first team,’ said Lambert. ‘He’s playing little bits here and there but he’s still far from being an establish player. He’s not near the finished article. But he’s developing, which is great. The way his career is going hopefully something will be done.’ Negotiations are also underway with Fabian Delph and Ron Vlaar, who both see their contracts expire at the end of this season. ‘They’re different from Jack because they’re seasoned pros. We will see what happens,’ added Lambert. ‘We’re talking to their respective parties. That’s the good thing.’ Lambert insisted he would receive backing in his bid to tie down the trio from owner Randy Lerner, who attended his first match in two years for the visit of Arsenal last weekend — a sight suggesting his move to sell the club are on the backburner.

The Villa manager revealed Lerner is likely to come to more matches and added he has already begun discussing the January transfer window with new chief executive Tom Fox, presenting a sign of the American’s longer-terms plans. ‘Ultimately the decision will come from the chairman, what he wants to do,’ said Lambert. ‘He’s never once said to me, “You cant do x, y and z”. If he thinks it’s too dear he’ll say no, if he thinks it’s fine he’ll say fine. That’ s all you want, honesty. ‘If someone comes in (with a bid) that will make Aston Villa stronger and is right for the chairman, I still think that (sale) will happen.

The Ipswich defender nodded home from Chris Anderson’s cross to snatch a draw having first scored with a glancing header from an Anderson free-kick. It had looked like Clayton Donaldson’s first Championship goal for Birmingham, adding to David Edgar’s opener, had earned victory after wins against Cambridge and Brighton. At the double: Christophe Berra scored twice to rescue an away draw for Ipswich . On target: Birmingham City's David Edgar scores the first goal during the  Championship match at St Andrews . Birmingham: Randolph, Spector, Edgar, Hall, Grounds, Cotterill, Caddis, Davis, Novak, Donaldson, Thomas. Subs: Robinson, Duffy, Gleeson, Johnstone, Doyle, Brown, Gray. Ipswich: Gerken, Chambers, Smith, Berra, Mings, Anderson, Skuse, Hyam, Tabb, Sammon, Murphy. Subs: Parr, McGoldrick, Bajner, Bru, Hewitt, Henshall, Bialkowski. Referee: Roger East (Wiltshire) Clark was irritated by referee Roger East’s refusal to award a penalty for a trip on Paul Caddis with the score at 2-1 and for the five minutes of stoppage time added at the end. It was an encouraging performance though after last season’s close brush with relegation and showed the prudence of Clark eschewing the loan market for permanent transfers this summer. The Birmingham manager said: ‘I’m gutted for the players, they deserved another victory. But we won’t be too downhearted. They are a powerful team. ‘I’m delighted with what I’ve seen but devastated for the payers they didn’t get what they deserved. For the first time since I’ve been through the door I have a squad who believe in what I’m doing to a man.’ Mick McCarthy countered: ‘I think we deserved to get out of jail. It’s very pleasing.’ Birmingham opened the scoring on the half hour. Edgar rose unchallenged from David Cotterill’s corner to head home. Ipswich levelled five minutes after the interval when Anderson curled over a set piece from the left and Berra claimed the faintest glance. In the 64th minute Donaldson raced onto a through-ball by strike partner Wesley Thomas, glided past Tommy Smith, and slotted beyond Dean Gerken. But as the seconds ticked away Ipswich mounted a late rally and Berra found his second. Tussle: Birmingham City's David Davis is challenged by Ipswich Town's Daryl Murphy .

"Leonardo Ulloa, Leicester City’s club-record signing, says he has drawn strength from his opening day goal against Everton that he can succeed in the Premier League. The Argentinian striker drove home on his competitive debut to help his side claim a point and believes there is enough quality in Nigel Pearson’s squad to stay up. Ulloa only has played one season of top-flight European football in his career, while at Almeria in La Liga, but earned his £8million move to Leicester after averaging a goal every other game for Brighton in the Championship. Off the mark: Leonardo Ulloa is confident he will be a success at Leicester after an £8m move . ‘It’s more confidence for me, this goal,’ he told the Leicester Mercury after the 2-2 draw with Everton. ‘I enjoy the Premier League because this is new for me. I enjoy it all the time, in training, during play, and for the team. ‘It is important for us and the strikers because it is more confidence for us. For me, it is important but it is also very important for the team. I want wins but I think the team played really well for the first game.’ Leicester are expected to encounter a tough season and Ulloa admitted he needed to adjust to the fast pace, but his physique and height ultimately proved a handful. He believes Leicester’s manner of performance bodes well. Off the mark: Ulloa scored on debut in Leicester's 2-2 draw with Everton at the King Power Stadium . ‘It is different because there is more intensity than the Championship, but this team have quality and really good players,’ he added. ‘I don’t worry because we have a good team. ‘I enjoy the team, the club, I want to say thank you to the fans because I am really happy here. ‘I came here to play. I want to play, I want to help.

"Fabian Delph, who impressed on his England debut on Monday, is set to be offered an improved contract by Aston Villa. The 24-year-old midfielder has a year left on his current so is free to talk to clubs in January - and leave for nothing next summer - but Tom Fox, Villa’s new chief executive, is putting together a package to keep him. Manager Paul Lambert is confident an agreement can be reached, despite owner Randy Lerner wanting to reduce the wage bill.

Delph, signed from Leeds for £6million in 2009, is believed to be one of Villa’s highest earners on about £40,000 per week. Negotiating a long-term deal for him will be Fox’s first big test since arriving from Arsenal. The contracts of Darren Bent (£60,000 a week) and Alan Hutton (£40,000) also expire in the summer. If they leave it would free up substantial cash. Delph has said he wants to see out his career at Villa Park to repay the faith shown in him by the club after he suffered two serious injuries in his first two seasons. Meanwhile, Villa have offered Chelsea target Jack Grealish, 19, a new four-year deal.

"When the first episode of Match of the Day was screened 50 years ago this month there were more than twice as many people inside Anfield watching Liverpool play Arsenal than there were watching on TV later. John Motson, the veteran broadcaster who would go on to become such an integral part of a programme that remains a Saturday night comfort blanket for millions of football fans, was among that select audience of just 20,000 people who tuned in to see a highlights package of Liverpool’s 3-2 win. The programme back in August 1964 was low-tech, without fanfare, only available on BBC2 to viewers in and around London, and barely made it to a second season. And, just as today, it was TV rights and money that was almost its undoing. Wrapped up: John Motson, the veteran broadcaster, believes Match of the Day still plays an integral role . Many clubs, fearing this new programme would drastically reduce gates, were involved in a two-month stand-off with the BBC at the end of the 1964-65 season as they demanded more cash from the corporation. And they got their way as the Beeb caved in, agreeing to double the clubs’ collective fee to — wait for it — the princely sum of £25,000. Given that any club, from Manchester United to Bradford Park Avenue, could have appeared on Match of the Day, the new money worked out, on average, at £271.74 per club per in 1965-66. Last season, Manchester City alone raked in £72million in TV money while this coming season, 2014-15, the BBC are paying £59.9m to show highlights of the Premier League alone. Sky and BT Sport are paying £3bn for top-flight rights over three years. Times may have changed where money in football is concerned, but the enduring charm and relevance of Match of the Day hasn’t, certainly not in the opinion of two of its doyens, Motson and Barry Davies. ‘A lot of people have grown up with it,’ says Motson, 69. ‘It’s traditional, it’s safe, and it’s predictable in the sense you know what you’re going to get. That’s why you turn it on. Black and white: Liverpool vs Arsenal in 1964 was featured on the first ever Match of the Day broadcast . ‘At the end of the week Match of the Day presented a comprehensive, detailed round-up of exactly what had gone on. People felt when they turned it off and went to bed at 11.30pm they had caught up with all the football news. ‘I do still think that’s the case, you only have to look at the audience figures. It gets between four and five million and I can think of a lot of programmes on a lot of channels which would love those numbers.’ Davies, who worked on the programme from 1969-2004, said: ‘It wasn’t available to the whole country when it started and many people thought it would never catch on. The powers-that-be were certain that it would, and after England won the World Cup in 1966, it really took off.’ After two years on BBC2, MOTD made the leap to BBC1, following the heroics of Alf Ramsey’s England team, even though league champions Liverpool and FA Cup holders Everton were among a minority of clubs still unhappy with it. ‘The viewers’ sense was they were watching the best football in the world, and England were the best having won the World Cup,’ says Davies. ‘Pubs would empty just before 10pm on Saturday so people could get home to watch it. It sounds extraordinary now, but it was true. I was in awe of it as a programme.’ Capture the moment: Match of the Day still attracts viewing figures between four and five million . Motson’s big breakthrough came when Hereford upset Newcastle United in the third round of the 1972 FA Cup and the match was promoted to top of the running order. ‘It was originally called Match of the Day because they were only allowed to show one game,’ he says. ‘Ken Wolstenholme presented the first show from the pitch at Anfield, there was no studio. When I started there were only four cameras; two up on the main gantry, one lower down and, if they were lucky, maybe one behind one of the goal. ‘In my first decade, with Barry Davies doing the other game, the BBC only had one machine to replay action and that was used on the Saturday afternoon racing. So when a goal was scored in one of our games, Barry or I had to retrace it as best we could as the players ran back to the centre circle. ‘I would just hope I’d got the passing movement right. Then they put the pictures in later in the evening. Now, when a goal is scored, I get about five replays, probably two more than I need.’ Davies joined the BBC from ITV in the summer of 1969, a few months before his 32nd birthday, to commentate primarily on north-west matches. He would become part of a line of treasured household names associated with the show, from Wolstenholme and David Coleman in the early years, to Jimmy Hill, Motson, Des Lynam and Gary Lineker. Pundits: Match of the Day's Alan Shearer, Mark Lawrenson, Gary Lineker and recently retired Alan Hansen . Davies’s first assignment was supposed to be covering Leeds against Tottenham on August 9, 1969. But over breakfast he was told Coleman had laryngitis and would miss his own match, Crystal Palace against Manchester United, for which Davies was now expected to stand in. He dashed to London. ‘My preparation was virtually nil,’ he says. He commentated on a 2-2 draw and then hurried to the BBC’s Lime Grove studios where he helped Frank Bough to present that night’s MOTD, as two Palace players, Roger Hynd and Gerry Queen, were studio guests. The 1969-70 experiment of regional second matches did not work. The second match wasn’t always good quality; resources were thinner than now, cameras less common. By 1970-71, more resources were pushed into a two-match show each week, expanding over time to be highlights of multiple games. ‘The biggest change in football in 50 years is, I’d say, that it’s no longer the game of the man in the street,’ says Davies. ‘The general public had a rapport with the players they no longer have. When I started, players didn’t turn up in swish coaches or even swisher cars. You had a chance to establish relationships, as did the supporters.’ Davies’s mellifluous, measured tones can still be found on archive footage accompanying classic clips, such as one from December 1974 when title rivals Manchester City and Derby met at Maine Road. Former City hero Franny Lee scored the winner for Dave Mackay’s Derby, who would go on to win the title. Davies’s prescient commentary summed up the importance. Old school: Jimmy Hill presents the BBC football show in 1981, before the likes of Hansen . ‘Interesting,’ he said as Lee unleashed his shot. ‘Very interesting,’ he added as it screamed into the top corner. ‘Oh, look at his face, just look at his face,’ he added, telling viewers all they needed to know about the potential consequences. Every viewer will have their own favourite MOTD moments. Many will recall Alan Hansen, for example, in August 1995, telling viewers after a 3-1 win by Aston Villa over Manchester United: ‘You can’t win anything with kids.’ United went on to win the Double that season. Motson, veteran of some 2,000 games, reprises his argument that the show should not alter too much to keep pace despite being up against an ever-increasing amount of live football on rival channels. ‘It would be inadvisable to suddenly think: “We’ve got to change everything and everybody”. They’ve made one or two moves with pundits but by and large I think the tradition and the historic significance of Match of the Day is its strength.’","The programme back in August 1964 was low-tech, without fanfare, and only available on BBC2 to viewers in and around London .

"Jose Riga believes he can turn around a Blackpool team odds-on favourites for relegation but insists he needs help from those in charge of the purse-strings – and more speed behind-the-scenes. The Blackpool manager could only name four substitutes for their 2-0 defeat to Nottingham Forest at the City Ground, including two academy teenagers, because administrative issues meant recent signings scrambled after a stagnant transfer window were not registered in time. Travelling supporters chanted for the head of chairman Karl Oyston, who has only sanctioned free transfers and loans, after seeing the teamsheet. Ishmael Miller and Joan Oriol, two players ineligible due to paperwork problems, watched the match in the stands with their fans. Help: Jose Riga (right) believes he can turn things around at Blackpool, but needs help behind-the-scenes . Rally: The Blackpool boss talks to his players during a stoppage in play on Saturday afternoon . ‘I’m always happy to be able to do my job even in big, big, big difficulties,’ said Riga. ‘Normally it makes you stronger. That’s what I told to the players too. ‘Let’s say one main target is to give to the fans what they deserve. All the squad, the staff too, we have to have the same idea. We will do it.’ More signings must follow, though, and Riga challenged Oyston for funds. ‘It’s not about the quantity, it’s about the quality. They have to complement what we have,’ he said. ‘It’s not because I’m difficult, every manager has his own idea. I try to make some choice based on the quality, on the behaviour, and on what I need. Of course, I need a lot. The rest, other people have to take care about the money. ‘My ambition is to build a competitive team. If I’m here of course we want a better future. For me the main problem will be getting more players in. I was happy that no one got injured, because they are all coming from different clubs so we don’t know their fitness.’ In charge: Riga and Stuart Pearce (right) shake hands after Nottingham Forest's win on Saturday . Stuart Pearce had his own tribulations with club hierarchy the past week, after Karl Darlow and Jamaal Lascelles were sold without his knowledge. But he said he had made it up with Forest’s Kuwaiti owner Fawaz Al-Hasawi after ‘a kiss and a cuddle and a dance’. ‘Hopefully I’ll grab him for a bit to discuss player signings,’ he added. Pearce also had an embrace with Riga in the corridors of the stadium, and imparted some words of encouragement. ‘The way the manager galvanised the squad, it was great credit to them,’ Pearce said. ‘It was the worst possible preparation that the team needs. We had two players come in on Thursday and it took time to integrate them, let alone Blackpool.’ He added: ‘I’ve never seen that in football, especially at Championship, it’s very unusual.’ Tough job: Pearce believes Riga did brilliantly to galvanise his beleaguered Blackpool squad .

"There have been a host of big-money signings arriving in the Premier League for the top teams this summer with Alexis Sanchez, Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas just to name a few. But there has also been shrewd business done from the likes of Stoke, Swansea and QPR, sides that will all be looking towards the top half of the table. Below is the top ten players that could take the Premier League by storm this season. Remy Cabella . Club: Newcastle. Joined from: Montpellier. Cost: £12m. Early evidence suggests Cabella is the class act Newcastle hoped they were getting. He's scored twice this summer and has already excited fans with his array of tricks. But the 23-year-old marries graft to his craft and the France international promises to be a fan favourite on Tyneside. He operates in the territory just behind a frontman but drifts across the park picking passes. He also boasts a thunderous right boot for a player who is slight of frame and is a deadball specialist. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Remy Cabella, Dusan Tadic and Bojan Krkic in action . Technical: Cabella is widely regarded as a deadball specialist in the game . Bafetimbi Gomis . Club: Swansea. Joined from: Lyon. Cost: Free. Swansea bid £8million for him only last summer and view this signing as a major coup. Newcastle wanted to sign the French striker, who scored 102 Ligue 1 goals in 309 games, but he snubbed them for a move to Wales. The 29-year-old scored twice in pre-season and is expected to form an exciting partnership with Wilfried Bony, assuming Swansea keep the Ivorian. Technically, Gomis is a powerful and moderately quick striker who has an excellent finish and is good in the air. He is likely to play up front in a new 4-4-2 formation, or ahead of Gylfi Sigurdsson and alongside Bony in a 4-3-3. Powerful: Gomis has already impressed for new side Swansea during pre-season . Muhamed Besic . Besic (right) Club: Everton . Joined from: Ferencvaros . Cost: £4million . Made an immediate impact in his first appearance in Leon Osman's testimonial, catching the eye with the ferocity of his tackling. Such has been the way he has settled in, manager Roberto Martinez said it seems as if he has been at Goodison Park for 'three years'. It will take time for him to adjust to the Premier League and he does have Gareth Barry and James McCarthy to get past in the battle for a midfield place but it is worth remembering Martinez opted for Besic rather than pursuing a move for Jack Rodwell. Will provide energy and bite as Everton compete on four fronts. Talented: Besic has already been praised by his manager for how quickly he has settled into life at Everton . Dusan Tadic . Club: Southampton . Joined from: FC Twente . Cost: £10.9m . The Serbian has arrived in the Barclays Premier League as a virtual no-one, but the fact Ronald Koeman made his signing one of his acts as Southampton manager tells you how highly he is thought of by his new manager. The left-footed forward cultivated a reputation in Holland during his time with Gronigen and more recently FC Twente as a flamboyant and tricky winger. But it is Tadic's strike rate that will catch the eye. He has scored 32 goals from left-wing over the previous two seasons in Holland. The Saints may have just found themselves a player with the X-factor to help them forget about the summer's mass exodus. Prolific: Tadic has scored 32 goals from the left-wing during the past two seasons in Holland . Mauricio Isla . Club: QPR . Joined from: Juventus . Cost: Loan . Harry Redknapp may have struck gold in the transfer market yet again with the capture of Isla. The right-back was a star of Chile's exciting World Cup campaign that ended with that heartbreaking penalty shoot-out defeat to Brazil. His boundless energy up and down Chile's right side was a feature of the South American's play earlier this summer, and with Redknapp planning to switch to a 3-5-2 formation next season, Isla's engine will be vital for QPR as they look to consolidate their top-flight status. Quality: Isla was a stand-out performer at the World Cup for quarter-finalists Chile . Bojan Krkic . Club: Stoke . Joined from: Barcelona . Cost: £3m . Mark Hughes has secured quite a coup in signing this graduate of La Masia. Krkic, a forward or winger, broke into the Barca first team aged 17 and won three Liga titles and two Champions League crowns before his star faded. Now 23, he remains a beguiling presence on the ball, two-footed, capable of drag-backs and dribbles, but has been criticised for not finding the net often enough, scoring just four in 24 games as he won the Eredivisie on loan at Ajax last season. For Barca, he got 41 in 162 games. But he has three pre-season goals for Stoke and should be given a prominent role. Back on track? Bojan could prove to be the signing of the summer after signing for Stoke . Brown Ideye . Club: West Brom . Joined from: Dynamo Kiev . Cost: £10m . That head coach Alan Irvine admitted he had never seen the Nigerian international striker play should not unduly worry supporters. Albion's set up leaves recruitment predominantly to the hierarchy and the 25-year-old was scouted extensively. He is a physical presence up front and comes with a good record of 33 goals in 74 matches for Kiev in the Ukrainian top-flight. He might take a while to reach peak match fitness having surprisingly missed out on the Nigerian World Cup squad and failing to appear in pre-season as wrangles over his work permit were ironed out. Presence: Ideye could prove to be a key player for West Brom this season . Leonardo Ulloa . Club: Leicester . Joined from: Brighton . Cost: £7m . Nigel Pearson long identified his striking options as needing fresh impetus and tracked Ulloa all summer before the clubs eventually struck a price. The 6ft 3in Argentine cost Leicester a club-record fee and will provide a muscular focal point for attacks, an aerial threat, and be a willing runner in behind defences. He scored twice against Leicester in a 4-1 victory for Brighton that seemed to cement Pearson's pursuit. Question marks arise because Ulloa has never played in the Premier League while only one of three seasons at Almeria was in La Liga. He grabbed his first two Leicester goals in a pre-season victory over Rotherham. Step-up? Ulloa scored 16 goals for Championship side Brighton last season . Aly Cissokho . Club: Aston Villa . Joined from: Valencia . Cost: £2m . Experience has been the byword for Paul Lambert this summer and in Cissoko the Villa manager has that. At 26, the athletic left-back has already played in leagues in Portugal, France and Spain and spent last season on loan at Liverpool. It is fair to say he was not a favourite at Anfield, appearing just 19 times, as Jon Flanagan converted from the right to get in ahead. Nonetheless, Cissokho does have plenty of attributes needed by Villa, including power, pace and strength. He has one French cap from 2010 and cost Lyon £12m from Porto in 2009. All smiles: Cissoko will be hoping to hit some form for Aston Villa after a lacklustre spell at Liverpool . Cheikhou Kouyate . Club: West Ham . Joined from: Anderlecht . Cost: £7m . Very leggy, athletic but strong and he makes penetrating forward runs off the ball and seems to be all over the pitch. Imagine Patrick Vieira – and, on first look, he's a bit like that. West Ham will be very happy if he's anything like that when the season kicks off! Plays with his head up, likes to open his body and run at opponents. He's not the finished article and, when he becomes that player, he might not be at West Ham for that much longer. Enjoy him while he is there and the West Ham crowd took to him against Sampdoria at the weekend. There was even a Senegalese flag around the ground and he responded as the best player on the pitch. Now for Spurs next week… . Athletic: Kouyate was very impressive for West Ham when they played Sampdoria at the weekend .","While big-money buys Sanchez and Costa have caught everyone's attention this summer the likes of Bafetimbi Gomis and co could also be big hits .

"Raheem Sterling was making headlines for all the wrong reasons for much of last week after complaining of tiredness on England duty, but the winger bounced back with a match-winning display for Liverpool against QPR on Sunday. The 19-year-old was criticised for telling Three Lions boss Roy Hodgson he felt  tired so early in the season, and consequently only playing 27 minutes of his country's Euro 2016 qualifier against Estonia. But the youngster answered his critics in style  as he shone for Liverpool at Loftus Road, and  he tweeted on Monday that, 'Every setback is a setup for a comeback. God wants to bring you out better than you were before.' Raheem Sterling recovered from his England criticism to put in a star performance for Liverpool against QPR .

Hodgson meanwhile was at the QPR game but did not speak to Rodgers after the match about the Sterling situation, and whether the midfielder is being overused. Rodgers claimed there is no dispute between him and England's manager, and he told the Alan Brazil Sports Breakfast show on talkSPORT: 'We have exchanged messages and there is no problem at all. 'We spoke a lot prior to the World Cup. There were various staff members with England that work for Liverpool and obviously we provide a number of players for them. The relationship was good and still is good.'","Raheem Sterling was criticised for saying he felt tired on England duty .

"Manchester United duo Robin van Persie and Daley Blind have been called up to the Holland squad for their Euro 2016 qualifiers against Kazakhstan and Iceland. The Oranje need a win after losing their first qualifier 2-1 against Czech Republic in manager Guus Hiddink's first competitive game back in charge. The United pair will link up with fellow Premier League players Leroy Fer of Queens Park Rangers, Stoke defender Erik Pieters, and Newcastle's Tim Krul and Daryl Janmaat. Manchester United's Robin van Persie and Daley Blind are in the Dutch squad to face Kazakhstan and Iceland . Former Liverpool utility man Dirk Kuyt has retired from the national team after making 104 appearances . Holland will also be boosted by the return from injury of Bayern Munich forward Arjen Robben and Schalke striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar. One player who won't be involved in the Dutch squad is former Liverpool utility man Dirk Kuyt who announced his retirement from international football on Friday. Kuyt made 104 appearances and scored 24 goals for his country, including playing at three World Cups and two European Championships in a variety of different positions. Manager Guus Hiddink is boosted by the return to fitness of Bayern Munich forward Arjen Robben . Newcastle goalkeeper Tim Krul is in the squad, alongside his club team-mate Daryl Janmaat . QPR's Leroy Fer has also been selected despite an indifferent start to his career at Loftus Road .

"Scott Brown delivered a devastating critique of Celtic’s domestic failings by accusing players of lacking fight and ‘hiding’ during yesterday’s historic home defeat to Hamilton. Accies returned to the top of the table after their first competitive win at Parkhead since 1938, with scrutiny of Ronny Deila set to intensify after his team were booed for failing to respond to Ali Crawford’s strike early in the second half. Celtic, who fell to sixth after their first home loss in the league since November 2012, are now six points off the pace – albeit with a game in hand. But while Deila insisted he was far from worried by league form, skipper Brown spared no-one in his post-match appraisal, declaring : ‘People were just hiding and it was disappointing to see and play in. VIDEO Scroll down for Ronny Deila's post-match comments . Celtic captain Scott Brown has slammed his teammates following their shock 1-0 defeat to Hamilton . ‘I take my share of the blame as well in there. I’m not laying the blame at everybody else because we’re all in this together as a team. ‘We missed a few chances but at the end we didn’t deserve anything, to be perfectly honest. We didn’t play as well as we should have. We didn’t have enough movement and there weren’t enough people wanting the ball.’ Asked if he’d seen players ‘hiding’ before, Brown insisted: ‘Not as bad as today. It’s very disappointing. We tried to play but Hamilton pressed us high up the pitch and teams don’t do that at Celtic Park. We should be pressing teams high up the park - that’s what should be happening and it hasn’t happened. ‘I definitely understand the frustrations of the fans. It’s not just the fans - those are my own frustrations as well. Everyone in that dressing room should be devastated with that result. Ali Crawford (R) scored the winner to take newly promoted Hamilton top of the Scottish Premier League . ‘It’s been almost two years since we lost a league game at home and we wanted to keep that run going - but we didn’t do ourselves justice at all. ‘I don’t know how we never got going. I would love to tell you because I would be a great manager if I knew that. At the end of the day, we weren’t good enough. ‘It looked like we had given up fighting, we were second to balls, we didn’t have enough upfront and it just wasn’t good to watch.’ Crawford celebrates after his goal gave Hamilton a first win at Celtic Park for 78 years . Manager Ronny Deila (2R) speaks to Brown as he continues to struggle during his debut season . A clearly angry Brown added: ‘I am devastated. I don’t do getting beat. I came to Celtic to win games and we’re not winning games and performing just now - and I don’t know why that is. ‘We’re just not doing it as a team and as individuals. We’re just waiting for somebody like Kris (Commons) to score a wonder goal from 30 yards and then we’ re all happy - but that doesn’t happen every week. We have to play and work hard.’ Asked if new manager Deila was getting the message across to players, many of whom are new arrivals at the club, the Scotland midfielder said: ‘He is getting there slowly. Hamilton manager Alex Neil (2L) compared the victory to 'David vs Goliath' ‘It’s not about the manager. It’s also about the players. We need to deliver and, if we do that, then it gives the manager time as well. ‘Celtic are huge. I know myself that when I first came here I didn’t realise how big a club it is. Now the players have to realise this is a huge club. 'You look at the fans and I can understand why they were booing. We don’t want that. We should be entertaining them and we aren’t doing that just now.’","Celtic were beaten 1-0 by Hamilton in Scottish Premier League clash .

"For the second time this year France manager Didier Deschamps has been on the receiving end of abuse from the partner of a player he has not picked for the French squad. Back in May Deschamps did not include Samir Nasri in his World Cup squad, leading his girlfriend Anara Atanes to tweet, 'F*** France and f*** Deschamps! What a s*** manager!' And now the 45-year-old former Monaco boss has incurred the wrath of Noemie Jourdren, the wife of Montpellier goalkeeper Geoffrey Jourdren, who Deschamps has not included in his France squad for the friendlies against  Portugal and Armenia. Montpellier goalkeeper Geoffrey Jourdren was left out of the French squad, leading to his wife to vent at France manager Didier Deschamps . Back in May Deschamps was on the receiving end of this tweet from Samir Nasri's girlfriend Anara Atanes . France manager Deschamps answered questions from the media on Monday ahead of his side's friendlies against Portugal and Armenia . Mrs Jourdren took to Facebook to vent her anger and said: 'Deschamp (sic) I hope that you die tomorrow.’ It is believed that the post was in response to Deschamps' decision to replace Saint-Etienne stopper Stephane Ruffier, who pulled out of the squad, with Rennes’ goalkeeper Benoit Costil. The failure of Mrs Jourdren to spell Deschamps' name correctly only added to the ludicrous nature of the post, and the national team manager must be dreading the next time he has to pick a Les Bleus squad.

"In football an own goal is a reasonably common occurrence, but in rugby an 'own try' is not something that has ever happened before. Until Thursday night anyway, when an extraordinary incident took place in the Australian National Rugby Championship match at the Leichhardt Oval between the Sydney Stars and North Harbour Rays. Fans and players alike at the New South Wales venue were stunned when referee Ian Smith awarded the 'own try' against Rays forward Mitch Lewis during the Stars' 49-40 win. To make the situation even more ludicrous, Smith made the decision having consulted the television match official (TMO). Referee Ian Smith isn't sure about the try so asks for the advice of the television match official . North Harbour Rays forward Mitch Lewis (right centre on floor) grounds the ball (centre) inside his own try line . Despite the video footage showing Lewis grounded the ball, the referee awards a bizarre 'own-try' Lewis looks on stunned as the referee awards the try - he said after he was waiting to 'pack and scrum down' The incident occurred in the 21st minute of the National Rugby Championship clash, with the Stars  attacking the Rays' line. Lewis ripped the ball from Sydney hooker James Willan, and placed it back over his own line, thinking he'd conceded a five-metre scrum. Referee Ian Smith was unsure about what had happened so referred the decision to TMO Michael Blair to see if Willan had scored. Despite it being clear that it was Lewis who grounded the ball, referee Smith awarded the try to the Stars as the Rays forward looked on in astonishment. The official scoresheet for the match credited the controversial try to Willan, who was the closest Stars player to the ball. Sydney missed the subsequent conversion but the five points helped them to their 49-40 win. Reflecting on the incident Lewis told the Australian Daily Telegraph, 'I will be a walking, talking trivia question for a long time I guess.' A disbelieving Lewis later admitted, 'I will be a walking, talking trivia question for a long time I guess' 'I ripped the ball out and I had possession of it. I went to place it and as I was placing it back I wasn't sure if I should put it over the line. 'I thought it would be a five-metre scrum and I thought that would actually be the safest option. 'When the referee decided to go upstairs, I couldn't believe it but I thought, TMO will see it, fine, we'll still be safe. 'I was waiting to pack and scrum down. 'Then the decision came back for the try. You have probably seen the video, you can probably see my reaction. I couldn't believe it. I was trying to process it, I was a bit puzzled and bemused. I didn't know what to do, I thought with all today's technology it'd be sweet. We'd seen it but I don't know how they missed it.' It's unlikely Lewis will be involved in an incident as strange as this again.","Incident happened in Australian National Rugby Championship match between the Sydney Stars and North Harbour Rays .

"Jose Mourinho has revealed that he signed  Raphael Varane for Real Madrid in 2011 despite the  defender having 'one foot at Manchester United', and  footage of the centre back in training for France shows why he was so in demand. Receiving a high ball, the 21-year-old flicks the ball up with his right foot bent behind him and nonchalantly volleys the ball back from where it came with his left. The sublime piece of skill comes as Chelsea boss Mourinho has revealed how close the defender was to joining Manchester United three years ago, until he swooped to sign him for Real. Raphael Varane calls for the ball, flicks it with his right foot and catches it perfectly on the volley . Jose Mourinho revealed that Varane had 'one foot at Manchester United' when he signed him for Real Madrid . The defender played for France against Portugal on Saturday and helped Les Blues to a 2-1 win . 2014-15: Eight appearances, 0 goals, two clean sheets . 2013-14: 22 appearances, 0 goals, eight clean sheets . 2012-13: 28 appearances, 2 goals, seven clean sheets . 2011-12: 13 appearances, one goal, five clean sheets . Total: 71 appearances, three goals, 22 clean sheets . 14 France caps, 0 goals . Mourinho told Telefoot: 'I was on holiday and in Madrid. Zinedine Zidane arrived with a DVD and I thought, ""That player, with two years' work with us, would be fantastic"". 'Varane had one foot at Manchester United but Real Madrid are very strong and Rapha came to us.' The Portuguese manager also tried to sign the Frenchman in the summer for Chelsea, but he has since signed a new contract with Real, and Mourinho said the centre back would not be moving to Stamford Bridge. The 51-year-old added: 'I like Varane, but everybody knows that he will stay at Real Madrid.'

"Cambridge City striker Andrew Phillips has apologised for headbutting team-mate Josh Beech in his side's 2-0 Southern League Premier defeat by bottom club Banbury United. The striker was sent off for lashing out at Beech as the two exchanged heated words and squared up to each other after Phillips opted to shoot rather than pass. 'Both players have apologised to squad members, manager and board of directors,' read a statement from the club, who play in the seventh-tier of English football . Cambridge is usually associated with intellectual excellence but on Tuesday two Cambridge City team-mates were involved in an ugly spat on the pitch . 'Both Josh Beech and Andrew Phillips would also like to extend this apology to the supporters of the club without reservation. 'The club wishes to emphasise that they pride themselves on discipline both on and off the field.

'The pair of them have apologised to each other and their team-mates. You have to have discipline on the pitch.'

"The shock of Paris Saint-Germain's 3-2 win against Barcelona on Tuesday is still reverberating around Europe, with the French and Spanish press continuing to react to the result. In France, L'Equipe has reveled in the result - made all the more remarkable by the absence of captain Zlatan Ibrahimovic - and said the match ranks among the top 10 greatest victories ever for French clubs in Europe. Others in the top 10 are Lyon's defeat of Real Madrid in the last 16 of the Champions League in 2010, and Monaco's elimination of Los Blancos in the 2004 quarter-final. French newspaper L'Equipe claims Paris Saint-Germain's 3-2 win against Barcelona ranks among French clubs' top 10 results ever in Europe . Spanish paper Mundo Deportivo focused on Barcelona's failings, especially giving the ball away 54 times . Marca hailed Atletico Madrid's 1-0 win against Juventus, which got their Champions League campaign back on track . Perhaps unsurprisingly, Spanish paper Mundo Deportivo  focused more on Barcelona's failings, and particularly the Catalans' uncharacteristic wastefulness in possession. Luis Enrique's men gave the ball away 54 times in total, resulting in them losing the control they ordinarily exert on a match. The Spanish clubs performed better in the Champions League on  Wednesday however, with wins for Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid. Karim Benzema came off the bench to score the winner for Real Madrid in their 2-1 success at Ludogorets . Atletico got their European season properly started after losing their first match by beating Juventus 1-0 at the Calderon through an Ardu Turan goal. It was the first time the Italians had conceded all season. Spanish and Italian newspapers both questioned Juventus's florescent green kit in their reports of the game. Atletico's city rivals Real also got a win as they laboured to a 2-1 victory away at Ludogorets. The Champions League holders fell behind early on but leveled through a Cristiano Ronaldo penalty and grabbed the three points when substitute Karim Benzema fired home with 13 minutes left. The Italian papers reported on Juve's 1-0 defeat to Atletico and the bizarre green kit they wore for the match . The French striker had started the season slowly, with two goals from his first nine games, so the goal was a relief to him and his team. The Italian papers, as well as lamenting Juve's defeat in Madrid, also took a look at how its own players and managers got on for their respective clubs. Corriere dello Sport went with the headline 'Liverpool and Mario Balotelli in crisis' following the Reds' 1-0 defeat by Basle, and summarised former Azzuri manager Cesare Prandelli's miserable night in charge of Galatasaray against Arsenal by saying 'Arsenal overwhelm Prandelli'. La Gazetta dello Sport meanwhile hailed Italian forward Ciro Immobile's goal for Borussia Dortmund in the German club's 3-0 win against Anderlecht.

The RFU took a dim view of Samba's reaction and charged him with displaying an 'unpleasant gesture'. Samba attended the disciplinary hearing on Saturday and apologised for his gesture, but the committee decided a two-match ban, the minimum for such an offence, was appropriate.

The defender hadn't played since breaking his leg when tackled by Stevenage's Simon Hislop in January . He said: 'Of course I feel very happy. I want to play.

"Kevin Keegan may have been out for football for six years, but he showed he’s lost none of his verve as he sang, danced and teased presenter James Corden about his weight on Sky 1 show A League Of Their Own. The former England manager was on Jamie Redknapp’s red team, and took to the programme with gusto as he was relentlessly mocked for his infamous ‘love it’ rant at Sir Alex Ferguson when Newcastle boss in 1996. Before he even entered the stage he was met with by England cricketer Andrew Flintoff running at him half-naked, in what was a sign of things to come for the 63-year-old. Kevin Keegan sings his 1979 single ‘Head Over Heels in Love’ on Jamie Redknapp's knee . The former manager took to Sky 1 show A League Of Their Own with gusto, even when hoisted in mid-air . Keegan recieved plenty of stick on the show for his 'love it' rant back in 1996 aimed at Sir Alex Ferguson . Keegan lubes up comedian Russell Howard before launching him into foam bowling pins. As you do . The Yorkshireman, back in 1979, singing his hit single in Germany sporting a distinctly dodgy barnet . Keegan sang his heart out, much to the enjoyment of team captains Redknapp and Howard . After being mocked for his dodgy haircuts as a player, and boy were they dodgy, host James Corden showed a clip of Keegan performing the song he released, ‘Head Over Heels in Love’, in 1979. Rather than being bashful about the clip, Keegan leapt onto Redknapp’s knee and gave an a capella version of the song. Before long, host Corden, Flintoff and the other team captains - comedian Russell Howard and actor Jack Whitehall - were joining in with the old crooner. Even Saturdays’ singer Una Foden looked impressed. Well, sort of. James Corden, the show's presenter, mocked Keegan for his haircuts as a player - like this one from 1977 . The former England boss gets the audience going as he closes the show with an encore of his single . Ever the showman, Keegan jumped into the crowd to serenade a group of girls with his 1979 song that reached No 31 in the UK charts . Redknapp and Keegan give it some welly as they thrust Howard towards the foam bowling pins . The Yorkshireman's last job in management was his second spell at Newcastle, which ended in 2008 . Freddie Flintoff and Jamie Redknapp take each other on in a Sushi challenge as part of the show . Keegan also gave as good as he got, teasing Corden about his weight. The Yorkshireman said anyone would have had a good physique with the intense training regime he had to go through as a player at Hamburg, before adding 'actually, not you’ to the portly host. The joke prompted a high-five from cricket legend Flintoff. There was also a tender moment between Keegan and Redknapp when the Sky Sports presenter spoke of his admiration for the former Hamburg star as a player. Sportsmail's Redknapp called Keegan, ‘a legend. Like Wayne Rooney and Luis Suarez rolled into one.’ The former Newcastle manager was teased for his singing career, and is pictured here crooning on The Little and Large Show in the 1970s . Keegan took everything in his stride and dished out banter to host James Corden about his weight . The former Hamburg star Keegan (centre) celebrates after helping Liverpool to the European Cup  in 1977 . Soon after, Keegan and Redknapp were teaming up to paint lubricant onto Howard and send him hurtling into foam bowling pins, before the trio were hoisted into mid-air and asked to perform a dance move while answering trivia questions. Fittingly, the show finished with Keegan performing his song again and, ever the showman, he headed into the crowd to share the moment with the audience. Most importantly, did Keegan enjoy himself? He loved it. Keegan in his playing days, scoring for England against Denmark in 1979 at Wembley .","Kevin Keegan was a guest on Sky 1 show A League Of Their Own .

"West Ham's Matt Jarvis on guitar, golf and playing for England... Who is your sporting hero? Ryan Giggs. I play in the same position, so I watched him a lot and liked the way he played and as I was growing up I’ve looked to mould my game on him, what he does and how he plays in that position. Matt Jarvis (left) has moulded his career on his hero former Manchester United winger Ryan Giggs (right) What would you be if you weren’t a sportsman? I honestly don’t know but I have thought about property, being in that business. But I think it would still have to be something in sport or sport-related as I don’t know what else I would like to be in. Which other sportsman would you like to be? I would be a golfer I think. They travel to the most amazing places and a lot of the time the sun is shining when you watch it, so you are thinking it would be great to play on these courses in this weather. A great career and a good chance to travel the world at the same time. Due to his height, Jarvis said Tom Cruise (pictured) would be the idea person to play him in a film of his life . Career highlight? Playing for England. Don’t think there would be anything higher in the game than that. I am very proud to have achieved it and would love to again. ... AND the worst moment? Getting relegated. It is a horrible thing and something I wouldn’t wish on my fellow professionals. It affects everyone at the club you are at when this happens. If your house was burning down, what one possession would you save? Other than my wife of course, it would have to be the dogs. We have three so I would make sure I got those out. Favourite karaoke song? I have a couple: Kings of Leon’s Use Somebody and Robbie Williams’s Angels. The second is a bit cringy, but you can really go for it as everyone sings it with you, so they can’t really hear your voice if it’s bad! Three most-listened to songs on your ipod? I have Ed Sheeran’s new album X, which I am really enjoying. I couldn’t pick out three songs, I am enjoying it all the way through. I’d recommend it, definitely. Robbie William's Angels is Jarvis' go-to karaoke song along with Kings of Leon's Use Somebody . Playing for England is the highlight of Jarvis' career and he would love it to happen again . The last book Jarvis read was former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson's autobiography . Last book you read? It was Sir Alex Ferguson’s autobiography. It was a very good read, very interesting. Last film you saw? Gone Girl — had heard it was very good, and it was worth seeing. Can you cook? Best dish? I can cook — my signature dish would have to be spaghetti bolognese. I am better at following instructions than making my own meals or recipe. In a film of your life, who would YOU like to play you? It’s an easy one this because everyone batters me for my height, so I would say Tom Cruise. But look at all the films he has done, so not a bad choice""! Tell us a secret... I used to play the guitar when I was really young. I haven’t played in years so think I would have lost the art by now, but it is something people wouldn’t have known about me.

"Lukas Podolski recently posted a picture of himself on Twitter sitting comfortably on a cloud high up in the sky overlooking the London landscape. Arsenal are familiar with forwards possessing lofty opinions of themselves, but in the dying seconds of their Champions League encounter at Anderlecht, Podolski delivered a goal to match his high self-esteem. In fairness to him, the cloud shot was posted more in praise of England’s capital than anything but it raised a smile nonetheless. Someone had been busy on Photoshop. Lukas Podolski (front right) is embraced by Aaron Ramsey after scoring Arsenal's winner at Anderlecht . Podolski celebrates his goal after coming on just six minutes prior in place of Jack Wilshere . Podolski posted this image on social media in tribute to his two and a half years of living and playing in London . While he still has plenty of doubters, Podolski thanks those who have been behind him all the way . ‘For 2.5 years now I've lived & played in London, I like this great City,’ Podolski wrote to accompany the image, including hashtags ‘londonisred’ and ‘thebigsmoke’. If only this reporter could come up with a pun like that last one. The point is that while Podolski has been frozen out to a large degree by Arsene Wenger, he remains a cult hero to many Arsenal fans who like his breezy manner and humorous tone on social media. He has posted more than 3,100 tweets to his 2.23million followers. To date, he shows off 708 smiling, stylised pictures on Instagram, where he has almost 1.8m subscribers. On and off the pitch, Podolski is ever-ready to pose either solo or with a team-mate such as Alexis Sanchez . Podolski with hat-trick hero Danny Welbeck (left) after their Galatasaray win and Mo Farah at a charity event . ‘If only he could be as productive on the football pitch,’ Wenger might well scorn. That added-time goal in Belgium, six minutes after coming on, was his first of the season for Arsenal on his sixth appearance. He has however only had 145 minutes combined throughout this campaign. Only one start. Wenger simply doesn’t trust a man with 120 international caps to his name to do the business over 90 minutes, to offer work-rate with his supreme striking ability. Podolski slots the 90th-minute goal that handed the Gunners a vital victory over Anderlecht in Brussels . Arsenal places are elated after Podolski (right with Sanchez jumping on his back) scores in Belgium . The German striker was pumped for the Anderlecht clash and got his chance to be the hero late in the piece . Make no mistake, his goal against Anderlecht was huge. Had Arsenal drawn that match, their hopes of progressing to the knock-out phase of the Champions League for a 15th consecutive season would have been in doubt. It was a match they should really have lost on balance of chances. Instead, they are in position to qualify from Group D behind Borussia Dortmund. For that Wenger should be grateful to the player he signed for £10.9m from Cologne in 2012. Speaking this month after winning his latest cap for Germany in the 1-1 draw with the Republic of Ireland, Podolski said: ‘I have assessed my position in the team, and it has to change now. Let’s see what happens in the winter. The fact is that I'm not happy with it, that's clear.’ Podolski poses with his beloved dog Spinee and with his two grandmothers holding his World Cup medal . Podolski posts another Photoshopped gem ahead of their 1-1 draw with Tottenham on September 27 . Almost ever since that day though it has seemed likely Podolski will leave. Still only 29, he wants more playing time than he is receiving, quite understandably. A January transfer is not out of the question. Arsenal fans who have taken him to heart would be sad to see him go. His goal against Anderlecht may alter that eventuality. What is for certain, he will not be heading to Tottenham. ‘Hell would freeze over before this transfer would happen #Poldi #aha #AlwaysAGunner #Nevercheatyourclub #afc #RedArmy.’ More hashes than welcome in a full English breakfast, and more reason for Arsenal supporters to hold him in special regard.

"Excuses can’t be made anymore for Roberto Soldado’s poor performances, says former Tottenham manager Tim Sherwood. Sherwood believes the striker – who missed a penalty in Tottenham’s 4-1 defeat at Manchester City – has had enough time to adapt to English football since his £26million move from Valencia last summer and must start delivering. Sherwood also said that youngster Harry Kane is a better player than the Spain international. Roberto Soldado has failed to live up to expectation since joining Tottenham last summer from Valencia . 'In my opinion Harry Kane is better than Roberto Soldado,' Sherwood told BT Sport during his post-match punditry analysis. 'I chose Kane last year as he was consistently performing better in training. 'He [Soldado] needs to start producing on the field and we can't make excuses for him anymore. 'He should be settled in at the club after living here for over a year.' Soldado was given a rare league start by current boss Mauricio Pochettino in their 4-1 defeat at City on Saturday.

The Spain international was expected to be a hit in north London following a glut of goals at his former side - after netting 80 in 146 appearances.

"Queens Park Rangers striker Loic Remy has trained for the first time since the collapse of his proposed move to Liverpool.

Happy to be here: Remy signed autographs for delighted supporters during QPR's training camp in Ireland . Back in west London: Remy will now stay at QPR if he doesn't receive any other offers to leave the club . But after that fell through, he was back training with Harry Redknapp's side over in Ireland and could play in the friendly against Athlone Town on Tuesday. It is a significant about-turn for the 27-year-old after his manager appeared to be planning for life without the striker. Redknapp has gone on record saying he is willing to accept Remy back into his squad - even after the player searched for a move away - but did query Liverpool's decision to pull the plug on spending £8.5million. Injury problems have blighted the former Marseille man's career but, when fit, his pedigree in front of goal is unquestioned. Alan Pardew and Newcastle were heavily indebted to Remy last season after he scored 14 goals in 26 Premier League appearances while on loan and the manager did want to re-sign him.

Arsene Wenger is the right man to lead Arsenal to future glory, said the club's owner Stan Kroenke . Kroenke , speaking at Thursday's AGM, said he is proud of what the club have achieved under Wenger . Speaking the club's AGM on Thursday, the American said: 'We are proud of what we've accomplished. 'What a wonderful day that was at Wembley. One of the reasons we were interested in Arsenal was because of Arsene Wenger, and we look forward to much more success with him.' Meanwhile, Wenger is wanted by former club Monaco despite only signing a new £24million contract in May. Officials from the Ligue 1 club, who Wenger managed from 1987 until 1994, met the Arsenal boss two months ago when they travelled to London to take part in the Emirates Cup. Monaco had considered offering him a £10million-per-year tax-free deal, with his contract at Arsenal due to expire, but Wenger eventually signed a three-year extension with the Gunners.

"Edinson Cavani rescued a tepid Paris Saint-Germain performance by scoring a dramatic late winner for the French giants as they beat APOEL Nicosia 1-0 on Tuesday night in a drab Champions League encounter. The 27-year-old poked the ball past APOEL goalkeeper Urko Pardo in the 87th minute before celebrating with his controversial 'sniper' celebration that led to his eventual dismissal in Friday's Ligue 1 heated victory over Lens. Laurent Blanc's outfit remain top of Group F a point ahead of Barcelona who beat Ajax 3-1 in the other group tie.

Referee: Ovidiu Alin Hategan (Romania) Cavani's goal also extended PSG's unbeaten run to 16 matches in all competitions as they recorded their first back-to-back wins of the season. The Uruguayan had toiled all night and appeared to be carrying a knock but was on hand to give the French side an undeserved win that kept them top of Group F on seven points. Devoid of any cohesion and rhythm going forward, PSG were unable to create a clear goalscoring opportunity all night against a well-drilled and organised APOEL side until Cavani managed to bundle the ball home from close range. The Cypriot side, who are bottom of the group with one point, will feel they created the better chances during the match to merit a win, but were left to curse their luck as a lack of quality and two goal-line clearances from David Luiz kept them at bay. The result was a hammer-blow to the hosts, who deserved to get at least a point from the game and possibly more. APOEL lived up to its reputation of being a hard to beat at home, missing several good chances. After an uneventful first half, the visitors started strongly after the break with Cavani heading over the bar. However, the hosts rallied back and if it weren't for the intervention of PSG defender Luiz they would have taken the lead just before the hour mark. Midfielder Tiago Figueiras Gomes saw his brilliant glancing header cleared off-the-line by the Brazil international. Luiz was soon at it again, this time thwarting Cillian Sheridan's scuffed effort that had beaten Salvatore Sirigu in goal. Lucas Moura then came close to breaking the deadlock for the visitors following a swift counter-attack. Cavani played the ball into the path of the winger who cut inside the box and saw his left-footed strike just whistle past the post. APOEL continued to fashion the best opportunities, as both teams made changes, before Cavani broke Cypriot hearts late on. The £55million striker's goal means the French giants have now scored in all but one of their last 20 matches.

"CLICK HERE to see all the stats from the big game with our brilliant Match Zone . Mario Balotelli was the man Liverpool signed for European nights just like this against Basle. However, the £16million man endured a torrid evening in Switzerland as the Reds sunk to a 1-0 defeat in their Champions League Group B encounter. Throughout the entire match the Italian international failed to touch the ball once inside the Basle penalty area - a bleak stat that sums up his dire performance. Sportsmail covered the 24-year-old's movements inside St. Jakob-Park on Wednesday night. Mario Balotelli endured a disappointing performance for Liverpool in their Champions League defeat at Basle . 3 mins: Good turn and pass to release Lazar Markovic down the right who crosses towards the far post. Raheem Sterling's shot hits the upright but finishes the rebound, to then be correctly flagged for offside. 18 mins: Italian international wins a free-kick spinning Fabian Schar before being clipped on the heels by the centre-back out on the right touchline. 24 mins: Forward wins his second free-kick in the corner, holding the ball up well before being fouled by Geoffroy Serey Die.

Balotelli (left) earned numerous free-kicks for Liverpool, including one after being fouled by Serey Die (centre) 28 mins: The good and bad of Balotelli is summed up in this brief passage of play. The good?  He intercepts a loose pass on the half-way line. The bad? Instead of keeping possession he tries to go past two players and is tackled instead. Basel break and create an opportunity to score. 29 mins: Italian international is caught offside when played in by Steven Gerrard, showing little attempt to bend his run to try and stay onside. 40 mins: Balotelli's high-profile temperament is in full force when he moans at Sterling for shooting, instead of passing to him, when he was perfectly entitled too just outside the Basle box. Balotelli (left) tries to evade the attention of Mohamed Elneny (right) at St. Jakob-Park . 43 mins: The 24-year-old wins another free-kick for his team, this time beautifully nutmegging  Schar in the corner before being fouled. H/T verdict: Balotelli has been fairly anonymous for Brendan Rodgers' side despite winning a number of fouls. His performance can be summed up by the fact he failed to touch the ball once inside the Basle penalty area. Balotelli failed to have a single shot in the entire first half for Liverpool in Switzerland . Balotelli's first-half heat map shows he failed to get into the game for Liverpool . 48 mins: First real public display of frustration from Balotelli is shown when he unceremoniously fouls Serey Die and is penalised by referee Jonas Eriksson. 60 mins - He's scored a few a scorching free-kicks in his time and Balotelli sees his blistering 35-yard strike saved by goalkeeper Tomas Vaclik only for Markovic to miss the rebound. The 24-year-old's frustrations grew as the match wore on Wednesday night . Balotelli (centre) managed to only have one shot on target during Liverpool's clash at Basle . 63 mins: Balotelli tries his luck again from distance, with his confidence increasing after his earlier free-kick it seems, this time ballooning an audacious effort miles over that is more of a danger to the crowd than it ever was to Vaclik. 70 mins: Balotelli is booked for a light off-the-ball 'slap' on Taulant Xhaka - a needless caution but the frustrations of the maverick forward continue to grow. Balotelli (right) was booked after an off-the-ball incident involving Taulant Xhaka . 75 mins: The big striker is involved in a neat move that almost sees Liverpool equalise. Adam Lallana plays a clever one-two with the forward before releasing Sterling who's first touch lets him down when through on goal. 83 mins: Liverpool paid £16million for Balotelli from AC Milan this summer and a snippet of his skill is demonstrated as he deliciously controls the ball before entailing in a few kick-ups while shielding himself from surrounding defenders. His dribbling prowess is then followed up by winning a free-kick for his side moments later, 25-yards out after being fouled. Balotelli (centre right) managed to find the back of the Basle net late on but was correctly ruled offside . 88 mins: Balotelli finds the back of the net for Liverpool but is flagged offside by the linesman, after failing to time his run when played through by Gerrard. F/T verdict: An overall poor performance from the Italy international. The fact he registered ZERO touches inside the Basle penalty box says it all. For Liverpool to go far in this competition they need their £16million striker to vastly improve - especially as their next two games in Group B are against defending champions Real Madrid.

"Nemanja Vidic has been one of Europe's finest centre-back's for many years but he has endured a torrid start to his life in Italy at Inter Milan. The Serb followed Rio Ferdinand and Patrice Evra out of the Manchester United exit door this summer - with the trio forming the bedrock of the club's trophy laden defence. Replacing Vidic and Ferdinand has been a problem for the Red Devils, most evidently in their 5-3 Premier League defeat at Leicester earlier this month, but it seems a change has not been particularly good for the centre-back duo, either. Nemanja Vidic (bottom) and Rio Ferdinand (top) formed Manchester United's central defence for many years . Vidic's arrival at Inter was expected to help the San Siro outfit close the gap to Serie A champions Juventus . Upon signing a three-year contract at Inter,  Vidic stated that Italian football suited his game well . Appearances - 300 . Goals - 28 . 5x Premier League (2006-07, 2007-08, 2008-09, 2010-11, 2012-13) 1x Champions League - (2007-8) 3x League Cup (2005-06, 2008-09, 2009-10) 1x FIFA Club World Cup - (2008) 5x Community Shield (2007-08, 2008-09, 2010-11, 2011-12, 2013-14) The pair have shipped in a combined total of 18 league goals in the 10 matches they have played since they departed Old Trafford. While Ferdinand's struggles at QPR have been well documented in England, it's perhaps Vidic's shaky start at Inter that is the most surprising. At his unveiling at the San Siro he said: 'I don't think this is a step backwards in my career, I believe this is a step forward for me. 'Italian football suits my game well and, as I said before, I have joined one of the big European clubs.' The 32-year-old signed a three-year deal and was expected by many to help the club close last season's 42-point gap to Serie A champions Juventus. Vidic, however, endured a nightmare debut at Torino, conceding a penalty in the first half before being sent off with seconds remaining in the clash for sarcastically applauding the referee. The defender served a one-match ban and missed his side's emphatic 7-0 win against Sassuolo in the next match. Vidic (left) endured a nightmare debut for Inter at Torino, giving away a penalty in the first half . Vidic's (second right) night got worse when he was sent off for sarcastically applauding the referee . Returning from suspension, Vidic was immediately recalled to the starting line-up in their 1-1 draw at Palermo by boss Walter Mazzarri. Mazzarri's decision backfired three minutes into the clash, when the Serb's dawdling saw him dispossessed by Franco Vazquez, who scored past Samir Handonovic from a tight angle to put the hosts ahead. The former United captain looked more like his commanding self in the Nerazzurri's 2-0 win against Atalanta on Wednesday, but at home to Cagliari on Sunday he was found badly wanting. Vidic (left) looks dejected after his error allowed Palermo to take an early 1-0 lead in their match this month . Vidic suffered his first defeat as an Inter player where they were thrashed 4-1 by the Rossoblu - who were bottom of the table until that result. Even worse, the defender gave away his second penalty in four Serie A games, this time hauling down Marco Sau inside his own box. Andrea Cossu’s effort was saved by Handanovic but Inter’s defence fell apart as Albin Ekdal’s hat-trick condemned them to defeat. Vidic's career at Inter hit a new low on Sunday as they were thumped 4-1 at home to Cagliari . Inter boss Walter Mazzarri could only watch as Vidic conceded his second penalty in four Serie A games . Vidic needed the help of an engineer after he was caught stuck in the lift for two hours on a public holiday . VIDEO See Vidic scoring in the Champions Cup against Roma . Appearances - 455 . Goals - 8 . 6x Premier League titles - (2002-03, 2006-07, 2007-08, 2008-09, 2010-11, 2012-13) 1x Champions League - (2007-8) 2x League Cup - (2005-06, 2008-09) 1x FIFA Club World Cup - (2008) 5x Community Shield - (2003-04, 2007-08, 2008-09, 2011-12, 2013-14) Off the pitch, too, Vidic's acclimatisation to Italy hasn't got off to the smoothest of starts after he was caught stuck in a lift for two hours on a public holiday before engineers arrived to free him. His poor displays have been mirrored by Ferdinand following his free transfer to Loftus Road. In his six matches at the Premier League new boys, the 35-year-old has been part of a defence that has conceded 13 goals - with Harry Redknapp's side winning just one of their opening matches so far. Ferdinand was at fault for QPR's opening day 1-0 home defeat by Hull, allowing Tigers' matchwinner James Chester to score from a corner - an error that was heavily criticised by Match of the Day pundit Alan Shearer. Ferdinand has suffered a nightmare start  at QPR - conceding 13 goals in six Premier League games . Ferdinand is dejected after being at fault during QPR's opening day defeat by Hull . Ferdinand was beaten in the air by Peter Crouch (both centre) for Stoke's opening goal against QPR . In their 2-2 draw against Stoke earlier this month, the former England captain endured a torrid afternoon against Peter Crouch. Vying for the ball in the early stages of the match, Crouch embarrassingly outpaced Ferdinand - an asset that defender was once renowned for. Crouch soon tormented Ferdinand once more - beating him in the air to allow team-mate Mame Biram Diouf to score. Both Ferdinand and Vidic were wonderful at United but suddenly, maybe the decision to let them leave Old Trafford does not look too bad. Ferdinand (second right) was even outpaced by Crouch (far right) during their Premier League encounter .

"Boxing legend Muhammad Ali was reunited with NFL great Jim Brown on Saturday, almost 50 years after the pair were involved in a heated debate over the former's decision to not fight in the Vietnam War. The pair were in attendance at Ali's annual Humanitarian Awards service where Brown received a lifetime humanitarian achievement award. The line-up of Muhammad Ali Humanitarian Award winners included Academy Award-winning actress Susan Sarandon and Grammy Award-winning hip-hop artist Common. Other award winners included a half-dozen young adults from around the world honoured for their humanitarian roles. Muhammad Ali (centre) awarded Jim Brown (centre left) a lifetime humanitarian achievement award . In 1967 Ali was under increasing pressure for refusing induction into the Army with Brown on his side only after wanting to hear the the boxing champion's reasons for not answering the call to military service. Brown led a group of prominent black athletes who hit Ali with a flurry of questions during a two-hour meeting in Cleveland in June that year. Known as the the ""Ali Summit"", the boxer didn't duck the questions and stuck to his principles, citing his religious beliefs in refusing to join the military. The meeting between the pair evoked memories of the famous 1967 ""Ali Summit"" about the Vietnam War . The dozen athletes, including NBA greats Bill Russell and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, emerged from the meeting to publicly support Ali at a time when the champ was one of the country's most polarising figures. 'People got the answers that they wanted,' Brown recalled Saturday. Ali was stripped of his world heavyweight boxing title in 1967 while in his prime and was convicted of draft evasion. Ali found himself embroiled in a legal fight that ended in 1971, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in his favour. Hollywood actress Susan Sarandon (far right) was also a winner at the Muhammad Ali Humanitarian Awards . Ali regained the heavyweight title in 1974, defeating George Foreman in the ""Rumble in the Jungle."" A year later, he outlasted Joe Frazier in the epic ""Thrilla in Manila"" bout. His last title came in 1978 when he defeated Leon Spinks. Long before Ali became an icon, the meeting's participants were taking a risk by throwing their support behind him. 'It was the United States government that we were dealing with,' Brown added. 'Careers were at stake and everybody that showed up at that meeting put all of that on the line. That was heavyweight stuff.' Ali (centre) regained his heavyweight title after beating George Foreman (bottom) in 1974 .","Muhammad Ali honoured Jim Brown at his annual Humanitarian Awards .

"Leeds have sacked Graham Bean as their consultant after a disagreement over the club’s rearranged fixture against Reading next Wednesday. The 53-year-old was fired on Thursday after agreeing to move the club’s clash against the Royals back by 24 hours - much to the annoyance of club’s owner Massimo Cellino. The decision to reschedule the Championship match was made in July to accommodate Reading’s televised game against Wolves on Sunday. Leeds owner Massimo Cellino has sacked consultant Graham Bean over rescheduling their match vs Reading . Discussions between Bean, the Football League and former Leeds head coach David Hockaday were made before the decision was ratified. Despite being agreed two months ago, the news has only recently come to Cellino’s attention with the Italian aggrieved about the club’s continued rearranged fixture list due to television demands - leading to Bean’s dismissal. Former FA employee Bean confirmed his departure four months into his one-year contract in a statement to the Yorkshire Evening Post: ‘I’ve enjoyed my time working with the staff at Leeds United. ‘As far as working with Mr Cellino is concerned, I’d prefer not to comment. I wish the team every success for the season.’ Bean (pictured here in 1999) has worked as an employee at the FA in the past as a former compliance officer . In response to Bean's statement, Cellino told the Yorkshire Evening Post: 'Bean was an external consultant, this is a private matter and I don't want to speak about it publicly.' Prior to his sacking Bean had been been responsible for much of Leeds’ administrative work during Cellino’s short tenure to date. He helped oversee a major overhaul in the Whites playing squad ahead of this campaign with 15 players coming in as well as the £11million sale of Ross McCormack to Fulham.

"Filipe Luis insists he is happy with his decision to join Chelsea this summer despite limited opportunities at the club so far. The left-back moved to Stamford Bridge in a £16million switch from La Liga champions Atletico Madrid this summer and was expected to fill the birth vacated by Ashley Cole who joined Roma. Having been a key man at Atletico Luis' hopes haven't hit fruition yet at Chelsea with the Brazilian overlooked by Blues' boss Jose Mourinho preferring Cesar Azpilicueta.

Every time I play and train, I feel I'm at a big club,' he told the London Evening Standard. 'Everyone wants to play. If you don't, normally you're not happy. But when I came here, I spoke with Mourinho and I knew I'd come to Chelsea to be a champion, not to be the best left-back or best crosser or something. 'When you work with Mourinho, you have to know that the group, the collective is above the individual. I don't think about myself right now. 'The team are doing a great job.

"Martin Murray is potentially one victory away from a clash with middleweight knockout artist Gennady Golovkin. The Kazakh stopped Marco Antonio Rubio in the second round in Los Angeles on Saturday night, his 18th consecutive early finish. And the 32-year-old will return to the ring in Monaco in February for what will be his third visit to the principality. Gennady Golovkin stopped Marco Antonio Rubio in the second round to continue his knockout streak . Golovkin enjoyed his 18th consecutive early victory at the sold-out StubHub Centre in California . Rubio clambered to his feet after being knocked down but was counted out by referee Jack Reiss . Assuming Murray overcomes Domenico Spada this weekend, he will be among the favourites to face the IBO and WBA 'Super' champion. Golovkin's promoter Tom Loeffler admitted Murray is a 'natural' opponent for his charge and that American broadcaster HBO are keen on the fight. Other options for Golovkin include Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr and fellow world champion Miguel Cotto. Murray's fight against Spada is his third and final on his promotional deal with Golden Gloves which he signed earlier this year.

"Chelsea inflicted Maribor's first defeat in nine Champions League games this season with a show of strength at Stamford Bridge. Didier Drogba scored his first goal since his return to the club from the penalty spot after Loic Remy's opener. John Terry added a second before the break before a Mitja Viler own goal and two strikes from Eden Hazard put the icing on a big win. The only bad mark on the night for the Blues was an injury to Remy - likely leaving veteran Drogba to start against Manchester United on Sunday with Diego Costa also suffering from injury.

'I've got a lot more fans now that's for sure as I have boxed around the country, but I have been in the gym so I haven't been able to see the impact, it's a basic lifestyle really, . 'Because I am boxing so much, the turnaround is short. Bernard Hopkins said what has kept him in the game for so long is avoiding the celebrity lifestyle – that's what I need to do. I haven't had time to have a holiday, I would like to do that, eat some nice food in some tiny restaurants but I haven't been able to. 'I am aware of the expectations around me and the potential that the great guys achieved. I'm at the start of my career like they all were and I know that hard work is the key.

Even if I just achieve British level, as long as I give it 110 per cent then I am happy with that. I haven't brought into it yet as I haven't achieved it yet. I have the contender mentality and I am very self-critical. 'Bakhtov is a lot busier than my last opponent. I look at him the same as I looked at Matt Legg, one of my previous opponents, just with a lot more experience. Legg came out with a lot of hooks and gave it a go. Bakhtov can take punches for fun, and he'll be looking to get to me. Hopefully, he'll be the one eating a lot of shots. I have to get the win really.

"The man who inspired the best-selling book Moneyball believes Arsenal are the best-run football club in the Premier League. Billy Beane, the general manager of baseball side Oakland A's, used statistics to assemble a team of players he considered to be under-valued. And he insists Arsenal are primed for success despite the club being criticised for their safety-first approach when it comes to spending big. Arsenal train ahead of their Premier League clash with Hull at the Emirates on Saturday . Arsenal held their AGM this week where Arsene Wenger said he plans to spend in January . Arsenal's majority shareholder Stan Kroenke continues to back his manager Wenger . 'When I first came into baseball people didn’t want to hear that a team was a business,' Beane told the Guardian. 'But it is. And the better the business is run, the healthier the team on the field is going to be. That is why I admire Arsenal. 'If I’m buying stock in a football team that’s the one I buy. They’ve got revenues. They’re successful. They pay down their debt. 'And ultimately in today’s world that’s the best way for a long-term success.'

Liverpool attempted to implement the Moneyball principles under owner John W Henry but enjoyed limited success. And Beane believes the sacking culture in the Premier League has to change. He said: 'Two weeks ago I was listening to 606 and I heard some Liverpool fans questioning Brendan Rodgers – a man who nearly won the Premier League title this year – and I was thinking: ""Really?"" But that’s the challenge and noise you face. 'What also makes it difficult is that every year between a third and 50 per cent of league managers leave.

'I am not saying that based on my last performances, but in sparring and in the gym I believe that if I can replicate that I will prove it, and I need to deliver that. 'I believe I can become the best featherweight on the planet – and if you don't believe me, I'll open the gym up and let people come down to the gym and watch me spar. 'Joel is a tough customer, he has power in both hands and is the real deal so this is the time for me to prove I can get to the top and stay there. 'I have made my hard fights look easy recently, if I had stood and had a fight with them I might have made them look good but I boxed on the back foot, used my skills, and got easy wins. That's maybe why I am not getting the credit that I should be getting.' Selby outpointed Romulo Koasicha in Cardiff in May to set him up for his biggest fight to date . Selby and Brunker met in sparring in Las Vegas two years ago and the 27 year old hinted that fans can expect fireworks this weekend. 'We sparred a couple of years ago when he was 23-0, it was the first time I went to America, so he's only had four fights since,' added Selby. 'We sparred at Mayweather's gym a couple of times and it was competitive and then we sparred again in Eddie Mustapha's H.I.T Factory gym a couple of times. 'We didn't talk about fighting really, I was Commonwealth champion at the time and he's Australian so I had thought about it but not too much and neither had he, and we certainly didn't think we'd be meeting in a final eliminator for a world title. 'If the sparring is anything to go by, the fans are in for a treat.'","Lee Selby takes on Joel Brunker in an IBF world title eliminator .

"Sam Allardyce believes West Ham's new-found confidence can propel them to a shock victory over Manchester City on Saturday. The Hammers climbed into the Premier League top four after their 3-1 win over Burnley at Turf Moor last weekend, recording their first back-to-back league successes since March. And Allardyce has backed his side to repeat their earlier triumph over Liverpool when the champions come calling at Upton Park. West Ham celebrate during their Premier League victory over Burnley at Turf Moor last weekend . Sam Allardyce has backed his side to shock champions Manchester City when they come calling . West Ham produced a fine display earlier in the season to beat Liverpool at Upton Park . 'I think when you have had back-to-back wins you go into a game that you're not expected to win with much more confidence than you would normally,' he told the club's official website. 'West Ham fans would expect us to get something from the game but across the board not many other people will. 'So we will be looking to cause another storm and another shock like we did against Liverpool a couple of weeks ago.' Allardyce also reserved praise for his potent strikeforce after Diafra Sakho and Enner Valencia scored against Burnley. Diafra Sakho heads the opening goal past Tom Heaton to send West Ham on their way to victory at Burnley . Enner Valencia celebrates after scoring his second goal for the club against the Turf Moor side . Sakho has six goals from as many games for his new club while Valencia followed up his hat-trick for Ecuador last week with his second for the Hammers. 'He's [Sakho] hit the ground well and surprised us all and we just want to make sure it continues,' Allardyce added. 'It's my job to make sure he keeps his feet on the ground and doesn't get carried away. 'When Enner came back having scored three goals [for Ecuador], he was never not going to play as we hoped he would carry that on and he has. 'These two lads will get more and more attention. At the moment they're a bit of nobodies in the Premier League but soon people will catch on and will make life a bit more difficult for them. We'll see if they can handle that but they're certainly the big two for us at the moment in terms of these victories.'","West Ham climbed into the top four with a 3-1 win at Burnley .

"James DeGale will risk his guaranteed world title shot against Carl Froch when he takes on Marco Antonio Periban next month. The London super middleweight faces the experienced Mexican on the undercard of Nathan Cleverly’s rematch with Tony Bellew in Liverpool on November 22. Periban lost a majority decision to Sakio Bika for the WBC strap last year but is now without a win in three after drawing with Badou Jack before losing to J’Leon Love last May. James DeGale (above) faces Mexican Marco Antonio Periban in Liverpool next month . A James DeGale slip up would relinquish his mandatory challenger status to Carl Froch’s IBF crown . Should DeGale slip up, he will relinquish his mandatory challenger status to Froch’s IBF crown. ‘This is like a second final eliminator as if I don’t beat him, I don’t box for a world title,’ said DeGale. ‘It’s a good test, he took Sakio Bika close and he had J’Leon Love all over the place and should have finished him off. ‘He’s not a typical Mexican, he can box on the back foot and he’s going to come to fight and that will bring out the best in me. I am looking forward to it, it’s on a great show so roll on November 22. DeGale was last in action in May when he stopped Brandon Gonzales at Wembley in a final eliminator . DeGale stopped Gonzales in the fourth round to earn shot at four-time world champion Froch . ‘I didn’t want an eight round keep busy fight, I wanted a name that will impress people when I win in style and it will set up a fight with Carl. It’s not about me fighting Carl though, it’s about me getting my shot at the world title and making history becoming the first British gold medallist to win a world title.’ Periban, meanwhile, is determined to ensure it is he who earns a shot at Froch. ‘I appreciate this opportunity and will be putting in a huge effort into training, to win and to put on a great show in the UK,’ he said. ‘I lost a close decision to Bika for the WBC title and I want another shot. When I beat DeGale I hope for a shot at Carl Froch but first I am focused on November 22 and taking him out.’ Periban (right) lost to Sakio Bika last year in a challenge for the WBC super-middleweight title .","A James DeGale slip up would relinquish his shot at Carl Froch’s IBF crown .

And he told Sportsmail: 'It's potentially a massive springboard for my career and one that gives me the chance to become one of the top 15 ranked boxers in the world. 'I was originally scheduled to be fighting Chris Jenkins for a British title eliminator and I know he will probably be upset by the disruption this causes to his plans but I believe this could be a more rewarding fight for my career and hopefully he will recognise that. 'Chris would have been training hard and it's still a fight I would like to take should he become British champion. The reality is the fight with him was not a final eliminator and would not guarantee a British title fight even if I had won. I could be waiting around for another six months for the chance. 'At my age, 30, I can't afford to wait and that's why this has to be the right step now.

"A video showing Baltimore Ravens' running back Ray Rice punching his fiancee in the face and knocking her out cold has been released online. The incident took place last February in the Revel Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City following a heated argument between Rice and Janay Palmer, who are now married. Baltimore Ravens tweeted on Monday that they have terminated the contract of Rice and shortly after NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell announced that a two-game ban in July had been upgraded to an indefinite suspension. VIDEO: Watch Ray Rice knock out then fiancee when he punches her in a lift . (WARNING - GRAPHIC CONTENT) Caught on camera: Ray Rice (right) punched his then fiancee Janay Palmer (left) in a lift in Atlantic City . Released: Baltimore Ravens tweeted on Monday that Ray Rice's contract has been terminated by the club . The punch lifts Palmer off her feet before she hits her head on a hand rail, rendering her unconscious. Once the door opens, Rice drags her out into the hotel. He was later arrested and charged before being suspended by the NFL for two-matches and fined $500,000 (£310,000). A former employee told TMZ Sports, who released the video, that the NFL saw the video before issuing their punishment. The 27-year-old married Palmer in March, a month after the vicious attack and just a day after he was formally charged with assault and domestic violence. He could face a jail term of three to five years if convicted. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has since admitted he 'didn't get it right' in Rice's case and that harsher penalties will be issued in the future.

"Chris Eubank Jnr has failed to meet Billy Joe Saunders ultimatum to  sign a contract for their proposed fight on November 29 by 5pm on Thursday. The fight was announced earlier this month as chief support to Dereck Chisora's rematch with Tyson Fury at the Excel Arena in London. But Eubank Jnr failed to show at a press conference, forcing Saunders to issue an ultimatum which the Hatfield middleweight later revealed on Facebook had not been met. Billy Joe Saunders offered an ultimatum which Chris Eubank Jnr has failed to meet . At the press conference on Thursday morning, Saunders said: 'He’s had the contract since the first week in September, I’m the champion here and the only reason he’s got a shot here and a chance is because of his big mouth and everybody wants to see him get knocked out, and that’s what I will do to him. 'I’ve booked flights to go away, I’m going away on a training camp, spending a lot of money to bring people in, nutritionists, everything I need to prepare 100 per cent for this fight, and you’ve got him keeping messing around with contracts, changing money, changing loads of stuff. 'He’s had loads of time for it, the way I look at it I’m going to move on after today; if he’s not willing today to sign the contract, by 5pm tonight, I’m going to move on to something different. Chris Eubank Junior (right) has had his contract since the first week of September, according to Saunders . Frank Warren, boxing promoter, appeared with Saunders at a press conference on Thursday afternoon . 'I haven’t got time to be waiting around for bums, that’s all he is. He hasn’t boxed anybody yet he still talks like he’s a world champion. 'He hasn’t got a name, he hasn’t got a belt, he hasn’t done a 10-rounder, he refused a British eliminator, and now he’s had his chance to fight me and he’s ducking and diving.' Promoter Frank Warren, meanwhile, insisted he had agreed a deal in principle. He said: 'I thought I had an agreement with his manager, and his father Chris Eubank Snr; every time we’ve spoken things have changed, it’s not got to the stage where the contracts which we forwarded have been signed.' Eubank Jnr later tweeted: 'Frank Warren has tried to force me into signing a contract without my lawyers being able to look at it entirely and agree on it. 'He scheduled a press conference before the contract was even looked at properly to try and rush us into signing and agreeing on terms we don't want. 'There's no deadline or rushing when it comes to my career. I'll sign once my management team has gone through and ok'd the contract completely.'

'I've signed a really good promotional deal with Steve Goodwin,' he told Sportsmail. 'They've got a deal with Matchroom's Fight Pass which is really good. 'I'm just getting through some niggles from the last fight and I'm looking to be back out in December. If it all goes to plan I'll have another one after that then a title fight in March. 'I think we're going to be looking at the Masters title, which will be a 10-round fight. That could make me the mandatory for the Southern Area title. Any title is a big ask but if I win that then who knows with regards to the big honours domestically. 'This will be fight No 6 coming up and I'm still undefeated.

"It was Henry Cooper's manager who said that in Germany, 'You've got to knock them out to get a draw'. Almost 60 years since Our 'Enery was controversially disqualified in Frankfurt, Paul Smith became the latest Brit to fall foul of scandalous judging. The Liverpool super-middleweight pushed world champion Arthur Abraham to the brink in Kiel only to be left 'disgusted' by the scorecards. Paul Smith was left distraught after scandalous judging robbed him of the fight in Germany . Smith and world champion Arthur Abraham (R) appeared to be closely contested . Judges voted unanimously in favour of Abraham in another controversial decision from Germany . Smith is consoled by former world champion Ricky Hatton after the fight . After a nip and tuck fight that swung first to the champion and then to the challenger, the result appeared to be on a knife edge. But the ringside judges disagreed with two awarding Abraham the fight by six rounds while the other, disgracefully, gave Smith just one of the sessions. Visibly distraught, the 31-year-old said: 'What can you do? It's disgusting. It's the main thing I hate about boxing. Most of them [the judges] have never fought and they're robbing kids of life-changing opportunities. 'I proved I'm not British level. I did some things wrong but I did a lot of it right. I was outworking him every round. I was shading a lot of the rounds. It's Germany, I well and truly got my fingers burnt. Smith and Abraham trade blows during the fight in Kiel, Germany . Smith requested a rematch after the fight as promoter Eddie Hearns also complained about the verdict . Abraham is likely to chase a lucrative domestic fight against the winner from Robert Stieglitz or Felix Stur . 'I believe I did enough. At the end of the rounds I didn't think I was losing many of them.' Smith's promoter Eddie Hearn echoed his fighter's frustrations. He said: 'The sickening thing is the scores. These people can't be judging fights; they are not good enough. I can't help but laugh, how can you score that fight 11-1? 'The score cards go down in history but they won't reflect the fight. Paul has worked all his life for this opportunity and just wanted a fair crack at the whip.' Smith demanded an immediate rematch but that looks unlikely as Abraham chases a money-spinning domestic dust-up against old foe Robert Stieglitz or Felix Sturm who meet in November. Ironically, the latter is no stranger to claims of robbery from British fighters. Both Matthew Macklin and Martin Murray challenged the former middleweight world champion in 2011 but left empty handed after a split-decision loss and a draw respectively. Smith walks away 'disgusted' after the match was awarded to the home favourite . Smith has the dignity to congratulate his opponent after the end of the world title fight . Abraham admitted: 'Of course I would fight Paul again. I'm sure it would be another exciting fight. However the circumstances would need to be right. At the moment the most interesting fight for me would be Sturm or Stieglitz.' Smith, who remains the British champion, was philosophical on the morning after the night before. He tweeted: 'Listen I'm alive, I'm healthy and I've got an amazing family. Life's a bigger game than boxing. I've always said that. I'll be back!'","Paul Smith was defeated by world champion Arthur Abraham in Germany .

"Carl Frampton will have to put his hopes of a money-spinning unification clash on hold, even if he beats world champion Kiko Martinez on Saturday night. Frampton faces the Spaniard for the second time in front of 16,000 fans at a specially built arena in Belfast’s Titanic Quarter. But even if he delivers a repeat of his knockout early last year, the Norther Irishman must face mandatory challenger Chris Avalos, rather than the likes of Leo Santa Cruz or Scott Quigg.

Overlooking: Frampton will fight Martinez at the Titanic Quarter (background) in Belfast . Anticipation: Frampton and Martinez were at the Titanic Building for their pre-fight press conference . American Avalos has teamed up with Eddie Hearn’s Matchroom company and must get his shot at the winner within 90 days. Ironically, Hearn promoted Frampton until they split last year. But the 27-year-old is firmly focused on winning a world title after two decades in the sport. ‘It’s going to be a dream come true to win the world title. I started this long journey at seven years old and had my ups and downs, so to become a world champion in my 20th year of doing this sport, in a stadium built for myself - it’s what dreams are made of,’ said Frampton. ‘I don’t think you’ve seen the best of me. I’m 27, in the prime of my life but there’s still plenty more to come. I can see and feel the improvements everyday in training and after sparring. The best is definitely yet to come.’ Getting in the swing: Frampton entertains the crowd at an event in Victoria Square before the fight .

Martinez bounced back from his loss to Frampton in stunning style by stopping the undefeated Colombian Jhonatan Romero, stripping him of his IBF belt. Frampton, though, isn’t expecting anything different this time around from the 28-year-old Spaniard. ‘I think this is his 35th or 36th fight and every single one of his fights he has boxed the same way. He comes-forward, he’s aggressive and has an exciting style that the crowds like,’ he added, ‘I think our styles clash well and make for a good fight but I don’t see him doing anything different and expect him to come head first, trying to knock me out. ‘But it’s up to me to remain smart and switched on for the twelve rounds and as long as I stay focused there’s only going to be one winner. ‘I’m preparing for a hard, gruelling fight, that may take 12 rounds but no matter what happens I’m going to win. I also know I have the power to knock any super-bantamweight in the world out. ‘So it could be a 12-round points decision or it could be over in the first round. Nevertheless, I’m preparing for a very hard and brutal fight then we can talk about future fights.’ Frampton vs Martinez is live on BoxNation this Saturday at 7pm.

"Manchester United stars are forced to hand in their mobile phones the night before a match under strict new rules from manager Louis van Gaal. The Dutchman has laid down the law since taking over from David Moyes this summer and also drops any player who is late for breakfast on the morning of a game. But so far, Van Gaal's methods have failed to yield results with United failing to win any of their first three Premier League fixtures. VIDEO Scroll down for Louis van Gaal: A new team is not built in one month . I'll take that: Manchester United players must hand over their mobile phones the night before a game . Laying down the law: Van Gaal also drops any player who is late for breakfast on the morning of a game . After an opening day defeat by Swansea, they drew with Sunderland and Burnley and were also thrashed 4-0 by MK Dons in the Capital One Cup. Van Gaal has a history of taking a no-nonsense approach to management. In Maarten Meijer's biography of his compatriot, he wrote that while in charge of Ajax, Van Gaal fined players if they were even a minute late for breakfast - it was doubled if it happened again. The squad also had to start eating together and Van Gaal preferred that they only talk about football. At United, the 63-year-old ordered the first team and the youth squads to eat together while he introduced a strict 1pm lunch and the installation of £500,000 worth of HD cameras at United's Carrington training centre. Training days: Van Gaal had £500,000 worth of cameras installed at United's Carrington training centre . Defender Jonny Evans said during the club's US tour in pre-season: ‘We have this system at the minute where he can watch us on the pitch. The manager is saying, “You should be five yards to the right”. ‘We went through a video last night and I was 10 yards out. There are things you are doing on the pitch, and the whole team will be feeling the same, where you are thinking, ""Am I in the right position?"" Then the manager will show you in the video and you will know.' The mobile phone rule was introduced by Sir Alex Ferguson in an attempt to prevent the leak of team news.

"The Premier League may only be three weeks old but there have already been plenty of twists and turns. Chelsea have set their stall out early with nine points from nine while Louis van Gaal's Manchester United have stuttered. Here, EA Sports crunch the numbers to reveal the top 10  Premier League performers from the weekend. It's no surprise that Diego Costa tops the lead after his double at Everton but who else makes the top 10 in our Player Performance Index PPI chart? 10. Gabriel Agbonlahor, Aston Villa (PPI score: 40.2) Aston Villa, with Roy Keane as their new assistant manager, have made a solid if unspectacular start to the Premier League season and Gabby Agbonlahor found the net in his side's win over Hull, converting one of just two shots on target. On target: Gabriel Agbonlahor (left) helped Aston Villa remain their good start to the Premier League season . The EA Sports PPI is the official player rating index of the  Premier League. It measures a player's contribution to the success of his team. The intention is to remove any opinion bias and only work with proven statistical measurements which become more accurate as the season progresses. So, what are the six indices? 1. Winning Performance . 2. Player's Performance per match . 3. Appearances . 4. Goals scored . 5. Assists . 6. Clean sheets . 9. Graziano Pelle, Southampton (41.1) Southampton were expected to struggle after offloading a host of players over the summer but in Graziano Pelle the Saints look to have found a mean marksman worthy of filling Rickie Lambert's boots at St Mary's . As well as scoring against West Ham, he completed 27 passes at Upton Park. 8. Kevin Mirallas, Everton (41.9) He might be overlooked in favour of his more illustrious team-mate and countryman Romelu Lukaku but Kevin Mirallas has proved himself a valuable asset at Goodison Park. He found the back of the net against Chelsea last Saturday and enjoyed a 92 per cent pass accuracy. Unfortunately his performance wasn't enough to prevent Everton losing 6-3. Back of the net: Kevin Mirallas was on the scoresheet as Everton lost a nine-goal thriller with Chelsea . Short lived: Mirallas ended up on the losing side as Everton failed to stem the tide at Goodison Park . 7. Nemanja Matic, Chelsea (45) If anyone doubted why Chelsea splashed out £22million to bring Nemanja Matic BACK to Stamford Bridge, he is starting to show them. The 26-year-old has cemented his position in what is a highly competitive midfield and he proved his worth with a goal and an assist in his side's win over Everton. Midfield maestro: Nemanja Matic has consolidated his position in the middle of the park for Chelsea . 6. Andreas Weimann, Aston Villa (45) There hasn't been much to smile about down at Villa Park over the last few seasons but Andreas Weimann has proved himself a consistent performer for Paul Lambert. He showed his versatility against Hull, scoring one, setting up another and making four successful tackles. Foot in: Andreas Weimann (above and below) was the heartbeat of the Villa side as they beat Hull last weekend . 5. Ramires, Chelsea (45.8) Chelsea may have added Cesc Fabregas to their already burgeoning midfield this summer but Ramires continues to quietly impress for Jose Mourinho's side. He too managed to get on the scoresheet against Everton in what became something of a free-for-all. He also set up to others for his team-mates. Squeezed in: Ramires was also on the scoresheet during Chelsea's win over Everton . 4. Raheem Sterling, Liverpool (46.3) Last season was something of a breakthrough for Raheem Sterling as LIverpool finished second in the Premier League and he jetted off to Brazil with the England squad. While he may not wish to be reminded of the failed World Cup campaign, Sterling continues to impress at Anfield. Against Tottenham on Sunday, he scored the opener and completed three dribbles. Stunning start: Raheem Sterling opened the scoring for Liverpool at Tottenham on Sunday . 3. Morgan Schneiderlin, Southampton (55.6) While Southampton bought well over summer, perhaps their biggest achievement was keeping midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin at the club amid frenzied interest from Liverpool and Tottenham. And despite an initial outburst from the Frenchman, he appears to have put the speculation to the back of his mind. He scored twice against West Ham and  enjoyed a 91.8 per cent pass completion rate. Main man: Morgan Schneiderlin is still at Southampton after being linked with a move away this summer . 2. Nathan Dyer, Swansea (56.5) Swansea had something of a turbulent season last year but manager Gary Monk has presided over an impressive start to this campaign. He looks to be getting the best out of Nathan Dyer who had two shots on target and scored with both. He also made 21 passes in West Brom's half last weekend. Not so Dyer: Swansea's Nathan has been integral to their side during an impressive start to the season . 1. Diego Costa, Chelsea (65.6) As Chelsea scored six past Everton on Sunday, one player stood head and shoulders above the rest. A £32million buy from Atletico Madrid, Diego Costa had his doubters when he arrived on these shores but slowly but surely he is proving them wrong with a stunning start to the season. At Goodison on Saturday, he scored twice from his four shots on target. Six of the best: Diego Costa scores Chelsea's final goal against Everton at Goodison Park .

"Floyd Mayweather Jnr has praised fellow welterweight world champion Kell Brook for the way he ended the reign of Shawn Porter in Los Angeles earlier this month. Sheffield's Brook won the IBF title after recovering from a slow start to dominate Porter down the home stretch and win a majority decision.

'The guy Kell Brook came to my boxing gym I think five days before the fight and watched me spar a little bit. [He was a] cool guy and a true gentleman. He earned it the hard way. 'After that many fights, whether it's against tomato cans or against top opposition, you're going to have some type of experience to be able to go 12 rounds, and you have to be able to fight just a little bit if you beat everybody that they put in front of you. 'So congratulations to him and I wish him nothing but the best.' Homecoming: Brook was afforded a civic reception in Sheffield after returning with the world title . Mayweather is currently preparing for his rematch with Maidana next month but admitted his future opponents are yet to be decided. 'Well, I already know who I'm fighting September 13,' he added. 'As of right now, I don't know who I'm fighting in May and I don't know who I'm fighting next September, but you know I gotta take just one fight at a time and my focus is Maidana.'

"Nathan Cleverly has vowed to step up his quest to become a two-weight world champion by disposing of Tony Bellew in their rematch in Liverpool on November 22. The Welshman beat Bellew via majority decision in the same city in October 2011 but went on to lose his WBO light-heavyweight title in a knockout defeat to Sergey Kovalev last year. Bellew also suffered a jolting loss at the hands of Adonis Stevenson in Quebec last November but the pair now campaign at cruiserweight where they hope to muscle back in on the title picture. Nathan Cleverly has vowed to become a two-weight world champion by disposing of Tony Bellew . Cleverly said: 'Many people have asked me why I am going back to Liverpool to fight Tony Bellew again and the answer is simple - I don't like him. 'He talks too much and although I've beaten him before in front of his home fans, I am going to KO him this time around. He will not hear the final bell, I can guarantee you that. 'I will deal with him all over again and become a two-weight world champion.' Since his loss to Stevenson, Bellew has bounced back with two low-key stoppage wins over Valery Brudov in March and Julio Cesar Dos Santos in July. The two boxers fought previously with Cleverly winning on points, Bellew said revenge was motivating him . There is clearly bad blood between the pair and Bellew insists he will claim a victory comprehensive enough to send Cleverly into retirement. Bellew said: 'I have been waiting for this fight for three years and now it is here revenge is the only thing on my mind. 'This is a chapter in my life that I need to close and I will do that by ending Nathan Cleverly's career on November 22.

"Sam Allardyce believes West Ham's fans and owners will only be satisfied with a more attacking style of football if it is accompanied by an improvement at the back. The clash between Allardyce's perceived managerial pragmatism and the desire among Hammers supporters for free-flowing forward play has been a constant feature of his time at the club. This season has been earmarked as a chance for Allardyce to prove he can meet expectations and his side were a much improved attacking force in Monday's 2-2 draw at Hull. Enner Valencia marks his West Ham debut with a stunning goal from outside the area against Hull . Enner Valencia is congratulated by his West Ham team-mates after scoring his first goal for the club . West Ham's Diafra Sakho (on the floor) sees his effort deflect in off Curtis Davis . West Ham new boy Diafra Sakho celebrates with Enner Velencia after making it 2-2 . Enner Valencia conjured a stunning 25-yard strike on his first league start and, at 2-1 down, strike partner Diafra Sakho saw his shot turned over the line by home defender Curtis Davies. The pair gave a good impression of a deadly partnership in the making, but Allardyce reiterated his longheld belief that the defensive foundations remain just as important as what happens at the other end of the pitch. 'I think the owners here want us to win more than anything, like I want us to win,' he said. 'They're happy, we're all happy, with the way the squad is evolving and when you have more talented squad you play more attractive football. 'Though I say it with caution, attractive football is alright but you've got to start putting defensive units and defensive work together to get the results you need. 'Attractive football with no wins is no good to me and not to the owners and certainly won't be accepted by the supporters. Sam Allardyce says West Ham's fans would not accept attractive football if the club were not picking up points . Abel Hernandez (centre) heads in Hull's first goal in the 2-2 draw with West Ham . 'We were very good defensively last year as a team. We had lots of clean sheets in last year's campaign, 14 in fact, and we've not had one yet. For me as a manager, that's a disappointment. That's something we're going to have to think about.' West Ham twice came from behind to take a point at the KC Stadium, with debutants Abel Hernandez and Mohamed Diame on target for the hosts. The latter is a familiar face, having only left West Ham on transfer deadline day. The Senegalese had questioned his use by Allardyce and appeared particularly keen to make an impression, never more so than when scavenging Aaron Cresswell's throw-in in the build-up to his goal. Yet Allardyce insisted the £3.5million sale was still the right decision. 'We wish Mo all the best, it was a good move for him and good for us,' he said. 'Mo was running out of contract and would have been a free agent at end of the season, or may have signed a pre-contract abroad in January. Mo Diame (left) scores on his debut for Hull against his old club West Ham . Mo Diame is congratulated by his Hull City team-mates after making it 2-1 to the home side . 'We got good money for him and got in a good player, Morgan Amalfitano, with Premier League and Champions League experience.' Hull boss Bruce, meanwhile, is just as happy to have the bustling midfielder on board. 'Diame is a no-brainer. He's played in the Premier League for the last six years and what I saw him do on debut I've seen him do many times for Wigan and West Ham. 'He's big, powerful, handles the ball well with both feet, he's got a little trick and as we saw today he's got a goal in him.' Steve Bruce is delighted to have been able to sign Mo Diame from West Ham . The arrival of Hernandez and Diame, not to mention Hatem Ben Arfa and Gaston Ramirez, who both made their first appearances off the bench, has increased competition in Bruce's squad significantly. The likes of Sone Aluko, Yannick Sagbo and David Meyler all missed out on the matchday squad and the selection dilemma is unlikely to go away. 'We'd all love to (have) 17 (man squads) because it's easier to manage but we have to carry a 25-man squad because the transfer window doesn't open until January,' added Bruce. 'I've had no injuries this week and I've had to leave out six or seven players, which shows the strength in depth we've got now.'","West Ham manager wants his side to be defensively solid to pick up points .

"A multiple sclerosis patient says police repeatedly asked her is she was a drug addict and a prostitute after she reported being raped last year. The alleged victim, who wishes only to be identified as Kris, told NBC New York that she fell asleep on a bus December 5 and missed her stop - ending up in Trenton, New Jersey. She was trying to find a bus back to Hamilton when she noticed a man following her and then everything went black. Scroll down for video . Slow going: An alleged rape victim in New Jersey says it took police more than two weeks to formally interview her about the attack that happened December 5. She identified herself as 'Kris' to NBC New York . Scene of the crime: Kris says she was raped on a mattress on the floor of this abandoned home in Trenton after falling asleep on a bus and missing her stop . The next thing Kris remembers is waking up in a home on Farragut Ave, lying on a mattress on the floor while two men raped her. Kris says one of the men was extremely violent, hitting her in the face multiple times while covering her mouth. Eventually the two men fled and Kris was able to escape the house where she tried to flag down people on the street for help - to no avail. 'Three or four people I first saw, and they wouldn’t give me the time of day,' Kris told NBC. 'And then I saw four people across the street and … they told me to go away."" She had to walk more than a mile before she was able to find help at Mario and Frank's Pizzeria, where owner Frank Colella found her shaking, crying and bleeding. 'It was a mess,' he said. Staff at the restaurant called 911 and Kris was next taken to Robert Wood Johnson Medical Center in Hamilton. Ignored: Kris says she had to walk more than a mile before she found help in the form of pizzeria shop owner Joe Colella (pictured) At the hospital, a nurse performed a rape kit on her and police detective conducted a preliminary interview. But just a few hours later, the staff dispatched her and told her to go see an oral surgeon. Kris mother Denise is not satisfied with the medical care her daughter received at RWJ. 'This wasn’t just a cut on her hand or a sprain of her ankle. She had five fractures of her face,' Desnise said. 'It’s wrong. It’s totally wrong. If it was their family member they would not have sent her home.' Kris was later taken to a hospital in Neptune where she underwent multiple surgeries to repair her jaw. Left to suffer: The victim claims staff at Robert Wood Johnson hospital released her just a few hours after she was admitted, despite having a serious jaw injury. She eventually went to another hospital where she underwent surgery . A spokesperson for the hospital says they are investigating the incident. 'RWJH has a solid reputation for quality health care and patient comfort. And, although we may differ on any claims made, we believe that no patient should have such a negative view of their care at RWJUHH,' the hospital said. 'That is why we have undertaken a thorough review of the facts and continue to reach out to this patient to confidentially discuss those concerns.' Meanwhile, it wasn't until December 23 that police concocted their first formal interview with Kris about the rape. During the interview, Kris says a Trenton detective and Mercer County Prosecutor kept asking her if she was a prostitute or a drug addict, despite not having any criminal history involving solicitation or possession. Questioned: Kris says police asked her multiple times whether she was a prostitute or a drug addict after reporting the violent gang rape . 'When he asked his partner if there was one question they would like to ask, the one and only question he could come up with, out of everything in the book, was: ""Did you voluntarily pull down the man’s pants before he raped you?""' said Kris. She described the detectives as 'hostile' and says they treated the interview like 'it was a big joke and a waste of time'. 'They tag-teamed,' said Kris. '""Was I out there soliciting? Was I out there buying drugs? Why did I get off the bus at that spot?""' She is being prescribed a pain patch for an injury sustained in a multiple sclerosis-related seizure, but the detectives were suspicious the prescription is legitimate. '""You sure about her MS?"" That’s all they kept asking me,"" said Kris' mother. '""Are you sure she didn’t fall and this isn’t MS?"" They wanted to turn everything around, make her the victim all over again, and it was crap. Plain and simple crap. They didn’t want to do their job.' Both the Trenton Police and Mercer County deny Kris and her family's claims of mistreatment. In a separate statement Mercer Court Prosecutor Joseph Bocchine says it was the family that delayed the interview and that they tried multiple times to talk to Kris and were rebuffed until December 23 - which her family denies. Kris' mother also questions why the rape kit wasn't sent out for testing until Jan 2 - a month after the attack. DNA results are still not in on the kit.","The alleged victim identified as Kris, says she was raped December 5 after falling asleep on a bus and missing her stop .

"Metropolitan Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe will be quizzed by the Home Affairs Select Committee . Britain's most senior policeman will today face damaging claims that a 2012 Scotland Yard probe into alleged police corruption was a whitewash. Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe will be questioned on why his force was dismissive of renewed claims that a notorious detective had been in a corrupt relationship with the gangster father of one of Stephen Lawrence's killers. In 2012, it was claimed John Davidson, a sergeant who worked on the first Lawrence murder inquiry, may have helped shield Stephen's killers. Sir Bernard, who took over as Met boss . in September 2011, asked Detective Superintendent David Hurley to . investigate. Within a few weeks, he gave the Met a clean bill of health. Today Sir Bernard will be quizzed about this by the Home Affairs Select Committee. A . major review of the Lawrence case by Mark Ellison QC has already . accused the Met of 'providing misleading reassurance' on the corruption . issue. It said the Met's . 2012 report, compiled in a few weeks, stated incorrectly that the force . had disclosed all 'adverse information' about Davidson to the 1998 . Macpherson inquiry into Stephen's death. This . was wrong, according to Mr Ellison, who suggested Mr Hurley should have . considered police intelligence reports and any corrupt motive Davidson . may have had for his 'deficiencies' while working on the 1993 Lawrence . murder probe. On the report . by Mr Hurley, Mr Ellison said the Met's 'decision to commission such a . wide-ranging and significant review over such a tight time-scale was . unrealistic and ill-judged'. The withering assessment of the review of the Lawrence corruption allegations in 2012 is deeply embarrassing for Sir Bernard. Critics . believe the Met boss should apologise publicly for the flawed report. At today's select committee hearing, Sir Bernard will also be grilled . over a secret memo revealing the truth behind a 'lorry load' of . anti-corruption files which were shredded by Scotland Yard. A summary of the files says that investigators gathered evidence of wholesale criminal behaviour by police officers during an undercover probe at the Met in the 1990s. The memo said corrupt officers: stole and trafficked drugs; shared reward payouts with informants; sold police intelligence to criminals; fabricated applications for more rewards; and accepted bribes to destroy and fabricate evidence. But the 'lorry load' of information that contained the findings – including documents, photographs and videos – was mysteriously shredded during a two-day operation in 2003 when Sir John Stevens was commissioner and Sir Ian Blair his deputy. No one at the force has come up with a convincing explanation  for why the files were destroyed.  As revealed in a special investigation in the Mail on Saturday, disturbing questions remain over whether a web of corrupt officers undermined the inquiries into the murders of Stephen Lawrence and private eye Daniel Morgan in 1987. One potential link between the cases is Davidson, who is suspected of working on the Morgan inquiry in its early stages. He is also alleged to have had links with gangster Clifford Norris, father of David Norris – one of the two men convicted of Stephen's murder. Davidson, now retired, denies any wrongdoing.","Sir Bernard will be quizzed by the Home Affairs Select Committee .

"Leeds United are a step closer to naming Darko Milanic as their new head coach after Sturm Graz confirmed their manager's departure. The 46-year-old negotiated his release from his contract with the Austrian club over the weekend and is travelling to England for further talks to finalise terms with Leeds owner Massimo Cellino. The Slovenian, who can speak five languages, was targeted at the beginning of last week after it became clear to Cellino that he could not find a British coach suitable to his demands. Leeds United expect to name Sturm Graz boss Darko Milanic as their new manager on Monday . Milanic took charge of Graz for the final time against SV Josko Ried on Saturday evening before saying his goodbyes. The club posted 'All the best, dear Darko' on their official Facebook page on Sunday. Shortly before Sturm Graz beat SV Ried 1-0 in the Austrian Bundesliga on Saturday, a statement published on their official Facebook page read: 'Darko Milanic has received an offer from Leeds. 'Sturm have also been presented with a request from England. But now we concentrate fully on the game. We will say more on Sunday.' Speaking during the match against Ried, Sturm general manager Gerhard Goldbrich told diepresse.com: 'Milanic has a tremendous opportunity in England. We do not want to punish him.' Milanic is understood to have a clause allowing him to buy his way out of a three-year deal with Graz and he should sign the contract at Leeds tomorrow. Leeds have been without a head coach since sacking David Hockaday on August 28. Milanic will replace David Hockaday at Elland Road after he was sacked as Leeds head coach on August 28 . Various names such as Robbie Fowler, Chris Cooper and Oscar Garcia had been considered before Cellino settled on Milanic. Academy manager Neil Redfearn will take charge of today’s Yorkshire derby against Huddersfield Town, his fourth game in charge, before making way for Milanic.

"This is the first picture of one of two top BA pilots who died within days of each other after complaining about being exposed to toxic oil fumes on passenger planes. Richard Westgate, 43, died after instructing his lawyers to sue BA for health and safety breaches days before fellow pilot Karen Lysakowska, 43, passed away. Both claimed they had been poisoned by the fumes that can contaminate cabin air and which regularly force pilots to wear oxygen masks. Pilot Richard Westgate, pictured at the controls of an airplane, had instructed his lawyers to sue BA for alleged health and safety breaches . Mr Westgate's lawyers want to 'give . him the trial he never got' by suing the airline in a case they say will . be a 'moment of truth' for the aviation industry. They . say they are on the cusp of proving in court the existence of . 'aerotoxic syndrome', a chronic physical and neurological condition they . insist will one day be seen as 'the new asbestos'. Thousands of pilots are currently 'unfit to fly', one specialist doctor claims. Official . records from the Civil Aviation Authority show that pilots and crew . have to put on their oxygen masks at least five times a week to combat . suspected 'fume events'. In some cases, crew members have passed out - while passengers have been left in the dark. Ms . Lysakowska, one of the most talented pilots of her generation, had . begged bosses at BA to address the issue after she was grounded with ill . health in 2005, according to the Sunday Express. In a letter to them in 2006, she . wrote: 'My objective is to get well and carry on flying and not enter a . protracted legal battle because of the impact exposure to contaminated . air has had on my life but if I have to I will.' She later developed cancer however, and did not go ahead with suing BA. Mr . Westgate, a world record-breaking paraglider as well as a commercial . pilot, voluntarily grounded himself in 2011 after suffering whiplash in a . car crash. Concerns: Both pilots claimed before their deaths that they had been poisoned by fumes in the cockpit . Aviation medic Dr Michel Mulder said he had by then become concerned about his health and memory, suffering persistent headaches, chronic fatigue, loss of confidence and mood swings. Dr Mulder, who himself flew for KLM and suffered similar symptoms, said Mr Westgate did not tell his employer because he feared losing his job. He sought private medical advice to avoid any blemishes on his health record. Mr Westgate, who was not married and had no children, died on December 12 in Amsterdam, where he had been having treatment. He had been there since last April after diverting to the Dutch city while on his way to Swiss suicide clinic Dignitas, having given up all hope of finding a cure. Frank Cannon, a pilot and one of Mr Westgate's lawyers, said BA is liable under the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health regulations because it fails to monitor the quality of air on board planes. Pilots and crew wear oxygen masks at least five times a week according to the Civil Aviation Authority . Despite calls from pilots and the Aerotoxic Association, BA and all other airlines do not install air quality detection systems. Instead, they rely on the results of Government commissioned studies, the most recent of which by Cranfield University, Buckinghamshire, concluded in 2011 that cabin air was safe. Mr Cannon is now trying to force a groundbreaking British inquest into Richard’s death in which BA would be asked questions about aerotoxic syndrome. He said: 'I see this as an impending tsunami for the airline industry — it’s been hushed for and ignored for so long. We hope to use the inquest to give Richard the trial he never got. It would be the first judicial recognition of his condition.' A spokesman for BA said: 'Our . thoughts are with the families of the two pilots at this very sad time . and we offer our sincere condolences. 'We are not aware of any legal claims relating to the two individuals. 'It would be inappropriate for us to comment or speculate upon the individuals' cause of death.'","Pilots have to put on oxygen masks up to five times a week .

She went on to mention that he had recently been named 'Greatest Frontman of All Time' by British music magazine Q, and likened his look to that of Rolling Stones star Brian Jones and Ray Davies of The Kinks. Ghorbani's . list of other feature subjects includes a number of British musicians . like Robbie Williams, The Kooks and Marianne Faithful. Gallagher is father to three other children- one daughter and two sons. Timeline: Gallagher is pictured with his wife Nicole Appleton in Cannes in May 2010, just around the time that he would have been interviewed by Ghorbani for The New York Times . His daughter Molly was conceived when he had an affair with Lisa Moorish two months after he married his first wife, Patsy Kensit. Moorish, who also has a son with fellow British rocker Pete Doherty, initially tried to keep the paternity of her daughter a secret but it was revealed after Gallagher's divorce from Kensit. He had been paying Moorish £2,000 per month in child support throughout the marriage, since Molly was born in 1998. Lawyering up: Both Gallagher, seen performing in Ibiza on Wednesday, and Ghorbani have hired top New York divorce attorneys . 'It is his child and when I was pregnant he was paying her to keep quiet. Everyone was lying to me about it,' Kensit has said of Gallagher's first love child. Kensit gave birth to Gallagher's son Lennon in 1999 but the couple had already disolved their marriage at that point. Gallagher began dating Nicole Appleton in 2000 and they had a son, Gene, in 2004. The pair wed in 2008. Gallagher, who now fronts the band Beady Eye, performed at the Ibiza Rocks festival yesterday when the news broke. A housekeeper at the star’s £2.7million five-bedroom townhouse on the edge of Hampstead Heath, North London, said the whole family had ‘gone away’. The singer once said he wanted to move his entire family to New York as soon as his children have finished school, and last year bought a £1.6million apartment near Central Park. He was raised in low-income housing in Burnage, Manchester, by his mother Peggy after his abusive father left. He has a famously frosty relationship with his brother and former Oasis bandmate Noel, once pulling out of the phenomenally successful Britpop band’s American tour 15 minutes before the plane was due to leave. The pair have not spoken since Noel, now 46, walked out of Oasis in 2009.

"Darko Milanic is set to be announced as the new head coach at Leeds United on Monday after Austrian side SK Sturm Graz confirmed his departure. The 46-year-old's appointment would make him the club's first non British or Irish manager as owner Massimo Cellino's search to replace David Hockaday looks close to a conclusion. Sportsmail takes a look at the profile of the potential new Elland Road boss. Darko Milanic (right), in charge of Maribor in 2012, is taking charge at Leeds United . Milanicwill be the first non-British or Irish manager of Leeds and will work under Massimo Cellino . Playing Career . Born on 18 December 1967 in Izola, Slovenia, Milanic began his career with the local side before joining Serbian powerhouse FK Partizan at the age of 17 in 1986. During his seven years in Belgrade, Milanic became a cornerstone of their defence helping them to win the Yugoslav First League title and two Yugoslav Cups before moving to Sturm Graz in 1993. Whilst in Austria, Milanic enjoyed a trophy-laden seven years with the side as they won two consecutive Austrian Bundesliga titles, three Austrian Cups and three Austrian Supercups. Milanic (right) enjoyed a trophy-laden seven years as a defender for Austrian side Sturm Graz . International Pedigree . An important defender for club and country, the 46-year-old earned 42 caps for Slovenia between 1992 and 2000. The pinnacle of his international career would have undoubtedly have been captaining Slovenia to the finals of Euro 2000, held in Belgium and Holland, after beating Ukraine in a play-off. Their debut appearance in a major competition saw them yield two points from their three matches with Milanic starting the first two games - a 3-3 draw against Yugoslavia and a 2-1 defeat against Spain. Milanic retired from professional football at the age of 33 due to injury. Milanic (centre) captained Slovenia to  Euro 2000 - their first-ever qualification for a major tournament . The defender won 42 caps for his country during an eight-year spell between 1992 and 2000 . Managerial Career . Upon retiring, Milanic pursued a career in management where he was appointed the boss of Slovenian side NK Primorje in 2004 before becoming an assistant coach at Austria club SK Sturm Graz two years later. The 2007-08 season saw Milanic back in the managerial pressure cooker this time in Slovenia at Gorica before he enjoyed a successful spell at rivals Maribor the following season. There he won nine trophies during his five years at the club guiding them to four league titles, three Slovenian Cups and two Slovenian Supercups. His feats at Maribor saw him become the first coach to have won all three domestic trophies in Slovenian club football. After five successful years at Maribor, Milanic returned to SK Sturm Graz on a three-year contract in June 2013 where he led the club to a fifth place finish during his first year in charge. Milanic's most successful spell as a manager to date was at Maribor where he won nine domestic trophies . Anything else you need to know? There shouldn't be any problems of communication between Milanic and his inherited Leeds squad if he takes the reins at Elland Road. The Slovenian can speak five languages so getting his tactics across to his players shouldn't be any problem as the club look to return to the top flight of English football since their relegation in 2004. Communication problems at Leeds shouldn't be a problem to Milanic, who can speak five languages .","Leeds are set to announce Darko Milanic as their new manager on Monday .

"As the 7th century Boudiccan Revolt against Roman rule tore its way through the east of the England, towns were burnt to the ground by Iceni rebels. Now, a bone belonging of one the fire's victims have been found during redevelopment of a department store in Colchester. The jawbone dates back to around 60AD, and was unearthed among burnt building debris under the town’s High Street. Archaeologists have discovered a jaw bone (pictured) during redevelopment in Essex. The bone dates from around 61AD - the time of the Boudiccan Revolt when the town was burnt down by Iceni rebels. The remains were found among burnt building debris under the Williams and Griffin department store . It is only the second time remains of this kind have been found in the region and Philip Crummy, director of the Colchester Archaeological Trust, said the discovery ‘is extremely rare.’ The Boudiccan Revolt saw British tribes, under Boudicca of the Iceni, unsuccessfully try to defeat the Roman army. Boudicca was Queen of the Iceni people, a British tribe who lived in what is today Norfolk and parts of Suffolk and Cambridgeshire. Her name is an early for of the more commonly known name 'Victoria'. Her husband, Prasutagus, was ruler of the Iceni people, and the Romans allowed Prasutagus to continue as king, ruling on their behalf. But, when Prasutagus died, the Romans decided to rule the Iceni directly and they confiscated the property of the leading Iceni families.

"Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink has become the latest former Leeds United striker to put himself forward for the vacant manager’s job. The Dutchman, who played at Elland Road between 1997 and 1999, follows Robbie Fowler in expressing an interest. Leeds are searching for a new manager following the sacking of David Hockaday last month and Hasselbaink, speaking to talkSPORT on Wednesday, played up his credentials. Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink has put himself forward for the vacant manager’s job at Leeds . He said: ‘Leeds United is a wonderful big club where I had two great years. If they want to talk to me, of course I would talk [to them]. ‘I’ve got experience, I know I could take the club forward and I know I can take the club back to where they need to go. ‘But what do Leeds United themselves want? That’s the most important question. How do they see things? ‘At the moment there are so many things going on they need to sort out first, or maybe they have already. Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink scored 42 goals in 87 appearances for Leeds . ‘But if they want to talk to me, of course I would be interested. Who doesn’t want to manage Leeds United? It’s one of the 10 biggest jobs in the country.’ Owner Massimo Cellino returns from a trip to the United States on Thursday and will start to consider applicants. Hasselbaink, 42, only has one season of management experience with Belgian second division club Royal Antwerp, though he did have a spell as a coach at Nottingham Forest. He scored 42 goals in 87 appearances for the Yorkshire club during his two seasons there before moving to Atletico Madrid in Spain. Former Leeds striker Robbie Fowler has also expressed interest in the vacancy . Fowler, who turned out for Leeds between 2001 and 2003, has been pushed forward for the vacancy by intermediaries. The former Liverpool striker spent time as a player-coach at Muangthong United in Thailand and has been coaching back at Anfield with former favourites Steve McManaman and Rob Jones. Academy manager Neil Redfearn will be in charge for Saturday’s Sky Bet Championship trip to Birmingham City and Cellino said he has ‘not heard of anyone better to look after the team.’ However, the 49-year-old, who is entering his third spell in caretaker charge at the club, is understood to have reservations about taking the job on permanently. Cellino is keen to appoint a British coach and will be heartened that Steve Clarke, Tony Mowbray and Chris Hughton are among those in contention.","Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink says Leeds job is 'one of the 10 biggest jobs in the country'

"These drinks, meals and snacks contain up to double the safe amount of sugar that experts believe adults should consume per day. A single Starbucks caramel frappuccino has 11 teaspoons of sugar and a can of Coca-Cola or Pepsi has nine teaspoons, researchers have said. This week the World Health Organisation recommended people should have no more than six teaspoons of sugar in 24 hours. Doctors say this rule is key to avoiding obesity, heart disease and other serious illnesses because they fear sugar is as dangerous as tobacco. Sugar levels: Action on Sugar has compiled a list showing how many teaspoons of sugar many foods and drinks have. The World Health Organisation has recommended adults have no more than six teaspoons per day to tackle obesity and other health problems. A Starbucks caramel frappuccino has 11, Coke and Pepsi has nine and Fanta has eight . Experts have backed the advice but said today it is extremely hard to calculate how much a sugar people are eating or drinking, especially because of unclear labelling. Pressure group Action on Sugar has produced its own table of foods to make it clearer for consumers. It also revealed that many single products take up the new recommended allowance. For example a 51g Mars Bar has . eight teaspoons, a can of Red Bull has seven, a Muller strawberry . shortcake Crunch Corner has six teaspoons and so does an Innocent . smoothie. Action on Sugar science director, Aseem Malhotra, who wrote for the Mail on the subject today, told the Guardian: 'I agree with the WHO recommendation, but it has to be translated into something meaningful for the consumer.' The debate over the danger of sugar is raging and UN health chiefs have warned children should not be given fizzy drinks at all because they have dangerous sugar levels. Adults have been told should halve their average intake to six teaspoons a day - slashed dramatically amid fears that sugar poses the same threat to health as tobacco. Experts blame it for millions of premature deaths across the world every year. Graham MacGregor, a London cardiologist and health campaigner, said: ‘Added sugar is a completely unnecessary part of our diets, contributing to obesity, type II diabetes and tooth decay. ‘We have known about the health risks of sugar for years and yet nothing substantial has been done. ‘The new recommendations will be a wakeup call to the Department of Health and the Government to take action by forcing the food industry to slowly reduce the huge amount of sugar added across the board.’ Chief medical officer Sally Davies has already said a tax may be put on calorie-laden food and drink to curb soaring  levels of obesity. Labour suggested last night it would impose a maximum limit on sugar, fat and salt in products marketed at children. The number of obese British adults is expected to double from one in four to one in two by 2050 – at a cost to the economy of £50billion a year. Warning: People should halve their daily sugar intake to improve their health, the World Health Organisation says . The UN’s World Health Organisation said the crisis was being fuelled by hidden sugar in processed food and drink such as yoghurts, muesli, sauces, fizzy drinks, juice and smoothies. Last night it published the draft guidelines urging adults to eat no more than 12 teaspoons of sugar a day and to aim for six. And it said children should try for less than six teaspoons and avoid cans of fizzy drink such as Coke, which contains seven spoons. Francesco Branca, director for nutrition for health and development at WHO, said: ‘Obesity affects half a billion people in the world and it is on the rise. ‘Sugar along with other risk factors might certainly become the new tobacco in terms of public health action. The consumption of a single serving of sugar sweetened soda might actually already exceed the limit for a child. So certainly the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages should be done with great care. ‘It actually is one of the elements that has been more constantly associated to increase weight gain particularly in children.’ The guidelines will now be discussed by academics and medical experts before a final version is published. But Dr Branca said food and drinks manufacturers should drastically alter their products. A bowl of muesli contains two and a half teaspoons of sugar, a latte has five, a chocolate bar six or seven while some ready-meals have more than eight. Labour’s health spokesman Andy Burnham said his party was considering setting a legal maximum on the amount of sugar, fat and salt in foods aimed at children. ‘We have a big ambitious health policy coming out,’ he added. ‘We feel the Government has lost its way completely on public health, there’s no leadership at all now.’ It is understood the policy would cover products such as Kellogg’s Frosties, which is 37 per cent sugar. On Monday, Dame Sally told MPs that being overweight had become ‘normalised’. But David Cameron’s official spokesman yesterday played down the need for a sugar tax and said ministers would rather encourage food and drinks firms to voluntarily make products healthier. Chief medical officer Sally Davies (left) said a tax may be put on . calorie-laden food and drink to curb soaring levels of obesity, while . Andy Burnham (right) said Labour was considering setting a legal maximum . on the amount of sugar, fat and salt in foods aimed at children . Sweet tooth: Health experts are concerned about the 'hidden sugar' in sweets and sodas . He . added: ‘What we are doing is working with the industry. You have . already seen commitments from retailers and food manufacturers to reduce . levels of salt, to remove some artificial fats, to reduce calorie . content and improve labelling, as well as public health campaigns by . local authorities and the NHS.’ The draft guidelines do not address the health effects of sugar substitutes or chemical sweeteners. Andrew Percy, a Tory MP on the Commons health select committee, raised fears of ‘nanny state’ meddling. He . said: ‘What we need to do is educate people about food, and proper . labelling of food is important in that. But, in the end, people must . have the discretion to make their own choices.’","Experts say maximum of six teaspoons of sugar per day would be ideal figure for adults who want to stay healthy .

"A mother who has been dieting since childhood says she has finally achieved her dream body - thanks to a heart attack. Mother-of-two Lesley Pritchard, 43, claims her heart attack was the 'heaven-sent excuse' she needed to finally shift the pounds. As a type 1 diabetic, Mrs Pritchard relies on daily insulin injections which she says have caused her to crave piles of greasy pastries and crisps. Lesley Pritchard, 43, had a heart attack when she was 37 and weighed 17st. She says the illness made her realise her weight was putting her health at risk so she requested gastric bypass surgery. She is pictured (left) in August 2012, a month before surgery, and (right) now that she has lost six stone . Despite repeated attempts at dieting, she ballooned from 12st to 17st in just five years. However, reality hit home when she had a heart attack aged just 37. In September 2012, Mrs Pritchard had a gastric bypass on the NHS. Now six stone lighter, she credits the heart attack for her size 12 figure. She said: ‘Lying in bed one night, I suddenly felt really strange. I went from boiling hot to freezing cold and very clammy. ‘When I tried to move I was stopped by a deadening pain in my chest, and my arms felt like lead. Before her surgery (pictured) Mrs Pritchard was a size 24. Now, a year after the surgery, she is a size 12 and she says she is looking forward to a long and healthy life with her husband, Ian . Mrs Pritchard (pictured, left, with a friend just before her weight loss surgery) believes her type 1 diabetes was responsible for her weight gain as she claims the insulin injections caused her to crave fatty foods . ‘My husband, Ian, dialled 999 and within minutes I was being rushed to hospital in an ambulance.’ Mrs Pritchard says doctors told her that her heart attack was a result of her diabetes, but she was convinced her obesity was a contributing factor. She said: ‘My diabetes caused my heart attack, but the rapid weight gain had definitely put me at greater risk. ‘I knew then that I needed to make a change, whatever it took. Mrs Pritchard (pictured with her husband, Ian) said: 'My diabetes caused my heart attack, but the rapid weight gain had definitely put me at greater risk. I knew then that I needed to make a change, whatever it took' Mrs Pritchard is now a size 12 (pictured) and says that she loves her new body . ‘I hated bulging out of my size 24 clothes, but I never thought it would put my life in danger.’ Mrs Pritchard confronted her doctors and demanded she be put forward for a gastric bypass. The mother, from Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, was eventually given the surgery in September 2012 and now, a year on, she loves her new body. ‘I’ve already lost six stone and the weight is still dropping off,’ she said. Mrs Pritchard (pictured with her husband and daughters, Pollie, 14, and Felicity, 10) said: 'I hated bulging out of my size 24 clothes, but I never thought it would put my life in danger' ‘Every day I’m so thankful I got the kick I needed to make a change. ‘It might not exactly be a recommended diet plan, but my heart attack led me on the path to achieving my weight loss.’ Mrs Pritchard, a civil servant, has relied on daily insulin doses to control her diabetes since the age of 33. She was forced to switch from tablets to injections when she became pregnant with her daughter Felicity, now aged 10. Mrs Pritchard (pictured before her surgery) says she always struggled with her weight and that she exercised regularly but all of her efforts failed to shift her excess pounds . She said: ‘Soon I was injecting five or six times a day, just to stay alive. ‘I hated the side effects - the more insulin I took, the hungrier I was. ‘I’d scoff bread, pastries and crisps, binging on piles of calorific treats between meals.’ Mrs Pritchard tried exercising, swimming and going to the gym several times a week, but the fat would not disappear. Mrs Pritchard (pictured with her husband, Ian, and daughters, Pollie and Felicity, in 2011) said: 'My heart attack was sent from heaven - it forced me to focus on my health. I now have an amazing body, and I have my heart attack to thank' ‘I hated my bulge, but I’d put back on every pound I battled to lose. I really like designer clothes and I was desperate to fit into them. ‘I’ve always struggled a bit with my weight. I’ve been on diet after diet from the age of eight.’ Mrs Pritchard said she is now free to enjoy a healthy life with her husband. She said: ‘My heart attack was sent from heaven - it forced me to focus on my health. ‘I now have an amazing body, and I have my heart attack to thank.’ A gastric bypass is a last resort for people carrying a dangerous amount of weight. It is available on the NHS for people who have a BMI of more than 40, or for those with a BMI of more than 35 who also have a serious weight-related health condition. During the operation the digestive system is re-routed past most of the patient's stomach so that they digest less food and feel full quicker. The patient is left with just a small pouch in place of their stomach. After the surgery, people tend to lose weight very quickly - most people who have had this procedure lose two thirds of their excess body weight. Patients have to stick to a strict diet and exercise plan after the operation. Many people find that they are left with lose folds of skin after they lose weight - this can require further surgery to correct. Gastric bypass surgery comes with many potentially fatal risks, including internal bleeding and blood clots. One in 100 gastric bypass surgery patients die shortly after surgery. The surgery cannot be reversed. Source: NHS Choices .","Lesley Pritchard says doctors blamed her heart attack on her type 1 diabetes but she thinks her weight was responsible - she was a size 24 .

"Singer reported to have started dating Tre Holloway in March 2011 - five months after they danced together on The X Factor . She's only got six weeks to go before the start of her first UK solo tour, so Cheryl Cole has been working hard to ensure everything is perfect before she hits the stage. And to prove how much she is putting into preparations, the singer posted a 'sweaty' photo of her after rehearsals on her Twitter page. The X Factor judge's candid snap comes as it was reported she has been dating her 'new' boyfriend Tre Holloway since March last year. Working up a sweat: Cheryl Cole posted this photo of herself looking 'sweaty' after rehearsals for her first concert tour . Heat magazine claim Cheryl started seeing Tre, 27, in March 2011 - five months after they danced together during her performance of Promise This on The X Factor. In March last year, Tre updated his Facebook page to say 'in a relationship', but then hid his relationship status after friends started questioning who his mystery girlfriend was. The publication claims the pair have been enjoying incognito dates in Los Angeles - where Tre is based - and London as often as possible. However, its only been in the past few weeks they've have been photographed together in public. Hot date: Cheryl and new boyfriend Tre Holloway at the Rose Club in London last week . Last week, they were photographed together on three dates, including one night out with her Girls Aloud bandmates Kimberley Walsh and Nicola Roberts. A source told Heat: 'Earning Cheryl’s trust is no mean feat. She’s very cautious about relationships and rarely lets anyone into her . life, so she’s been taking it slow and keeping it under wraps for a long . time. 'It’s a huge statement that Cheryl has . now stepped out with Tre. It shows that she’s really . confident that she’s got something special with Tre, and that they’ll be . seeing a lot more of each other. To be let into Cheryl’s circle, which . is very tight, really means something.' Cheryl's new, or not so new, romance comes as she's preparing for her tour, which kicks off in Belfast on October 3. You crack me up: Cheryl and Tre share a joke in their taxi home last week . Following rehearsals yesterday, she posted a photo on Twitter with her long hair scrapped back, looking slightly oily, without a scrap of make-up on and a healthy-looking glow on her face from the exercise. She wrote: 'Sweaty hair, sweaty face and sore toe but first day of rehearsals is over!! Phew!! EXCITING!!' She then added: 'Lol @ myself in that picture #ohgod!!' She announced her tour dates in June shortly after she was criticised for her singing during the Queen's Jubilee concert. In an interview shortly afterwards, she said: 'I am very aware of my ability, I know I’m no Mariah Carey but I think the emotion in the song is what matters. It's making people feel what you’re singing about.'",Singer reported to have started dating Tre Holloway in March 2011 - five months after they danced together on The X Factor .
"Concern: The report reveals how the number of cases of diabetes being treated in the UK has more than doubled in the last 20 years . One adult in ten has diabetes in some areas of the country, a report reveals today. The number of cases being diagnosed has more than  doubled in the last 20 years, largely due to rising obesity. The borough of Brent in North London has the highest rate, with 10.5 per cent of adults known to have diabetes, the figures show. In Newham, East London, 9.9  per cent of adults are sufferers, with  9.6 per cent in Wolverhampton  and 9.4 per cent in Harrow, North London. In Sandwell, West Midlands, the rate is 9.4 per cent and in Leicester it is 9.3 per cent. The report by Diabetes UK predicts that by 2020, 1 in 12 children will have diabetes. Presently 7.4 per cent of under-16s are diagnosed, but this is set to rise to 8.4 per cent. There are 2.9million adults and children with diabetes in the UK. Of those, 90 per cent have type 2, which is usually triggered by obesity. The charity estimates at least another 850,000 people have the condition but do not yet know it. Many of the worst-hit areas have large South Asian populations. This group – which includes those from India, Pakistan, Nepal and Afghanistan – is six times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes. Scientists believe this is partly down to a genetic difference that means their muscles do not burn fat well. Traditional cooking methods using oil, creamed coconut milk and a high-fat butter called ghee may also play a role. Barbara Young, chief executive of Diabetes UK, said: ‘It is truly alarming that there is now somewhere in England where more than one in ten of the people have diabetes. ‘Given that the increase in cases is mainly due to a sharp rise in type 2 diabetes, the only way we will finally bring the increase under control is by getting much better at preventing cases of type 2. Growing problem: The steady increase of diabetes sufferers has been linked to rising obesity rates . ‘A vital first step is to ensure that people realise how serious it is and understand their own personal risk so if they are at high risk they can make the simple lifestyle changes that can help prevent it. ‘If people are overweight, have a large waist or are over 40, they need to get a risk assessment, as should people who have a family history of diabetes or are South Asian and over 25.’ The charity urged adults at high risk to speak to their GP or pharmacist for advice. Diabetes occurs when the body cannot break sugar down into energy. This happens when the hormone insulin does not work properly or the body does not make enough of it. Symptoms include thirst, tiredness, weight loss and constantly needing to go to the toilet. There is no cure, but it can be treated by tablets, insulin injections or, for mild type 2, by a change of diet. They're seen as a naughty treat for a sweet tooth,  but Krispy Kreme glazed doughnuts, at 7g of sugar each, look saintly next to some ‘healthier’ offerings, researchers say. A large Costa Coffee red berry fruit cooler drink has almost 14 times more sugar, at 97.1g – or 24 teaspoons. A large Starbucks coffee Frappuccino – without whipped cream – has 61.6g of sugar, as much as nine doughnuts. Glaceau large vitamin water has 15g. Even a ‘skinny’ Starbucks lemon and poppyseed muffin has 44.4g of sugar, while Pret A Manger’s Bircher muesli has 32.7g. Credit Suisse carried out the sugar consumption study. The recommended daily amount is 90g for women, 120g for men.","Report by Diabetes UK predicts problem will get worse in coming years .

"We've long known that a lack of sleep makes us feel irritable and crave carbohydrates, not to mention make our skin look dull. Now scientists say that just one week of poor sleep can disrupt hundreds of genes, increasing the risk of a host of life-threatening illnesses linked to stress, immunity and inflammation. The discovery could explain why lack of sleep is so bad for the health, they say. Sleep deficiency is associated with a host of conditions including obesity, heart disease and mental impairment . For the new study, researchers examined gene activity in 26 sleep-deprived volunteers. They found that insufficient sleep had an impact on more than 700 genes. Some had their activity dampened, while others became extra-active. Those affected included genes associated with the ‘body clock’ cycle, metabolism, and immune and stress responses. The scientists were led by sleep expert Professor Derk-Jan Dijk, from the University of Surrey, who described sleep as a ‘pillar of health’ - just like diet and exercise. The researchers wrote in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences: ‘Insufficient sleep is increasingly recognised as contributing to a wide range of health problems. 'Multiple studies have shown self-reported short sleep duration - defined in most studies as less than six hours - is associated with negative health outcomes such as all-cause mortality, obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and impaired vigilance and cognition.' Indeed, sleep deficiency is associated with a . host of conditions including obesity, heart disease and mental . impairment. Sleep expert Professor Derk-Jan Dijk described sleep as a 'pillar of health' - just like diet and exercise . Prof Dijk’s team analysed RNA - the messenger chemical that delivers coded ‘instructions’ from the genes to cells - in the blood of volunteers. RNA can be used as a tool to measure gene activity. Participants were exposed to a week of poor sleep during which they slept no more than six hours a night. At the end of this time, they had to stay awake for around 40 hours while RNA samples were collected at three hourly intervals. The results were compared with the effect on the same volunteers of sleeping up to 10 hours a night for a week. Again, RNA samples were taken during a long period of wakefulness at the end of the study period. During the ‘sleep-restriction condition’ volunteers got an average of 5.70 hours sleep a night. The scientists noted: ‘Sleep obtained in the sleep-restriction condition was not sufficient to maintain alertness or performance.’ The findings may be relevant to many people living in industrialised societies, they said. For many thousands of Britons sleeplessness is a grinding fact of life - one in eight sleeps for less than six hours a night and more than a third suffer from insomnia at some time. The news comes just after scientists in Germany discovered that children who get a good night’s sleep have a boosted memory. The researchers at the University of Tuebingen, Germany, found that during deep sleep children have slower wave activity in their brains and that this is critical to the ability to learn, think and remember. Therefore, if sleep is disrupted, their ability to remember things they have learned will be affected.","Poor sleep can impact 700 different genes .

"The NHS safety watchdog is to be given Bank of England-style independence from government to stop ministers ordering cover-ups of care failures. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said new powers would be rushed into law to stop officials from burying 'uncomfortable truths' about failures in the health service. He said he wanted the Care Quality Commission to act as the nation’s chief whistleblower on health. Watchdog: Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, pictured (right) during a visit with David Cameron to the Range Medical Centre, in Whalley Range, Manchester, unveiled plans to give the Care Quality Commission independence . In a speech to the Tory party conference in Manchester, Mr Hunt announced he was giving up powers as Health Secretary to intervene what the CQC does. It means the CQC will not have to wait for ministers to order an investigation into a hospital or care home and the Health Secretary will not be able to dictate the content of its annual report. The new posts of Chief Inspector of Hospitals, General Practice and Adult Social Care, will also be enshrined in law. Mr Hunt said it was a major reform 'that will stop politicians ever attempting to suppress or cover up poor care again'. 'We’ll stamp out bad care wherever we find it - public sector, private sector, hospitals, care homes, surgeries - and never cover it up.' He added: 'As soon as Parliament returns we will legislate to give the quality watchdog the statutory independence it so badly lacked under Labour. 'This means never again can Ministers or political advisors lean on them to suppress uncomfortable truths, and never again will care failings be covered-up by managers dancing to their political masters’ tune. 'We will also put the new Chief Inspector posts in statute, so that patients will always have powerful advocates to speak up for them without fear or favour. 'For the hundreds of families who suffered under a system that put political priorities first, we are determined to end the culture of poodle regulation, cover ups, and closing ranks when whistle-blowers and relatives try to speak up.’ Surgeries: David Cameron said GPs had to open later and at weekends to ensure patients get the care they need . The move came as David Cameron called for GP surgeries to open seven days a week and outside office hours. The Prime Minister set out plans for the first wave of surgeries which will be open from 8am to 8pm every day, making it easier for patients who struggle to fit in visits with their family and work commitments. The move is a response to growing concern over the quality of out-of-hours care. Labour allowed GPs to opt out of responsibility for patients outside office hours and at weekends as part of a botched deal which came into force in 2004. Since then, private companies have taken over and in many cases have been forced to employ foreign doctors, many of whom have a poor grasp of English. Mr Cameron told ITV's Daybreak: 'I think it is the right approach to look at this because obviously our accident and emergency departments do a brilliant job but they do have 4million more people going through them than was the case in 2004, a lot of people going to accident and emergency really need a GP rather than accident and emergency, so I think this pilot scheme…is a very good step forward. 'There will be a pilot scheme to start with fully funded, properly funded by the government and then we look to rolling it out across the country. I think it’s a very good idea and it will also help hardworking people who want to go to see a GP but find it difficult to see a GP when they need to.' Response: Mr Cameron's announcement comes amid growing concerns over over the quality of out-of-hours care. The Prime Minister wants surgeries to open between 8am and 8pm . Ministers say soaring attendances at . over-burdened accident and emergency units have been exacerbated by the . failure of doctors to provide a good service around the clock. The . Government is now creating a £50million fund that will be available to . 50 practices across the country which will open next year. Together, . they are expected to cover half a million patients. Ministers say the scheme would then be extended across the country. As well as seven-day-a-week access and evening opening hours, the new surgeries will also try out services to suit modern lifestyles, such as greater use of Skype, email and phone consultations. They will also offer electronic prescriptions and online booking of appointments, online registration and use the latest technology to enable remote ‘tele-care’ of the elderly and vulnerable. Ministers say they will take a ‘dim view’ of applications for funding from practices which want to cover the extra opening hours with locum GPs. ‘This is about family doctors finding different ways of working, perhaps with district nurses,’ said a source. Welcomed move: Chairman of the Royal College of GPs, Dr Clare Gerada, pictured left, welcomed the announcement while Chairman of the National Association of Primary Care, Dr Charles Alessi, pictured right, described the plans as 'exciting' The move will not require a renegotiation of the GP contract, though ministers are already seeking substantial changes to it. Surgeries will be scored on access by the chief inspector of general practice, using Ofsted-style ratings, and ministers say patients will quickly come to expect access outside office hours and at weekends and ‘vote with their feet’ by switching away from surgeries which don’t adapt. Mr Cameron said: ‘Millions of people find it hard to get an appointment to see their GP at a time that fits in with their work and family life. 'We want to support GPs to modernise services so they can see patients from 8am to 8pm, seven days a week. ‘We also want greater flexibility, so people can speak to their family doctor on the phone, send them an email or even speak to them on Skype.’ He said the Government was looking at other ways of easing pressures on A&E, including opening more doctors’ surgeries in hospitals. Professor Steve Field, chief inspector of general practice, said: ‘This move towards seven-day services is great news for patients, and should be embraced by GPs.’ Dr Charles Alessi, chairman of the National Association of Primary Care, said: ‘This has the potential to be the most exciting development in primary care in the past decade.’ Earlier this year, it emerged that doctors were being paid £1,350 a shift to work  for Britain’s biggest out-of-hours care provider, Harmoni, because managers were so desperate to cover evenings  and weekends. Dr Clare Gerada, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, said: ‘We welcome the announcement of £50million as a small first step towards redressing the massive under-investment that general practice has seen in recent years.’","New laws will see ministers lose power to control Care Quality Commission .

"It's every shopaholic’s dream – a debit card that credits your account with the amount you spend instead of leaving you poorer. So when Sarah Wood realised her Maestro card had become her golden ticket to free spending, she made the most of it to the tune of £10,000. But, inevitably, her luck soon ran out and once the authorities realised what was going on 42-year-old Wood found herself in court charged with fraud. Scroll down for video . Sara Mattin, 42, and former husband Steven Mattin, 43, used a pre-paid debit card to con a shop out of £20,000 because every time they bought something money was put into their account, instead of being taken out . Her pre-pay card was used to buy . £10,137 worth of goods from an independent mini-market, prosecutors . said, all the while crediting Wood’s account instead of debiting it – so . she effectively gained more than £20,000. The . court heard this was potentially the result of a computer glitch, or . due to the fact that the shopkeeper may have been processing the . payments incorrectly – causing the store to not only give away goods for . free but also accidentally pay to top up the card. Wood . and her ex-partner Steven Mattin, 43, who had joined her in the . nine-month spending spree, both pleaded guilty to fraud. The court heard . the pair, neither of whom are believed to be in employment, visited the . store so often they befriended the owner. Pre-paid debit cards work in much the same way as regular debit cards, except when the balance reaches zero, they cannot be used any more, similar to travel money cards used on holiday. They are often used for household expenses such as shopping because they allow users to keep accurate tabs on how much they are using. Nigel . Clive, for Mattin, told Hull Crown Court that Wood was the main . instigator of the fraudulent spending, although Mattin was aware of what . was going on. ‘It was a . genuine card,’ he said. ‘They don’t understand how the money was put on . it, whether it was a glitch in the system or the shopkeeper didn’t know . how it worked, but once they realised, they did carry on like it was a . golden ticket.’ Prosecutor David Bradshaw said that once the owner of . the shop, in Hornsea, East Yorkshire, realised what the card was doing . they phoned the issuer, who had no idea why it could be happening. So in . May last year, the owner contacted police. At first Mattin did not realise what was happening, but after becoming aware of the mistake, she took advantage of the shop-owner, visiting up to seven times a day . Mr Bradshaw added: ‘The shopkeeper seems to be the loser in this.’ Richard . Thompson, for Wood, told the court she regretted fraudulently using the . card, and felt she had ‘betrayed’ the shop staff. Judge . Michael Mettyear handed Wood, of Knottingley, West Yorkshire, a . nine-month prison sentence suspended for 18 months and ordered her to . carry out 150 hours of unpaid work. He said: ‘This was a golden ticket and although it doesn’t condone it, the fact is a machine or person made the mistake. ‘It doesn’t forgive or excuse what you did, but you took advantage of it.’ Drug . addict Mattin, of no fixed address, was also sentenced for burglary . after breaking into Wood’s neighbour’s house for money to buy valium, . shortly after he was released from prison for a previous offence. The . court heard he took a jar of change, two laptops and some prescription . pills, as well as ripping the money out of birthday cards. He was jailed . for three years.

"A death row inmate scheduled to be put to death later this month compared prison sentences to slavery in a stinging indictment of the US judicial system. Ray Jasper, a Texas inmate, submitted his letter to media blog Gawker. Jasper was convicted for participating in the 1998 robbery and murder of recording studio owner David Alejandro and sentenced to death as a teen. Gawker initially reached out to all death row inmates with scheduled executions this year back in December 2013. In January it published a letter Jasper wrote in response, detailing his experience on death row. Jasper's letter included his reflections on the justice systems and its perceived flaws -- and even compared prisoners to slaves. Ray Jasper, seen in this file mugshot, was sentenced to death after being convicted for the 1998 robbery and murder of David Alejandro . 'Under the 13th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution all prisoners in America are considered slaves,' he wrote. 'We look at slavery like its [sic] a thing of the past, but you can go to any penitentiary in this nation and you will see slavery [...]People need to know that when they sit on trial juries and sentence people to prison time that they are sentencing them to slavery.' Jasper also said that prisoners 'have no choice' but to work while incarcerated -- and that the alternative may cause severe mental harm. 'If a prisoner refuses to work and be a slave, they will do their time in isolation as a punishment,' he wrote. 'You have thousands of people with a lot of prison time that have no choice but to make money for the government or live in isolation. The affects of prison isolation literally drive people crazy. Who can be isolated from human contact and not lose their mind?' Jasper also said that jail sentences given to first-time offenders are a form of  'oppression.' Jasper says, 'People need to know that when they sit on trial juries and sentence people to prison time that they are sentencing them to slavery' 'There are guys walking around with 200 year sentences and they're not even 30 years old,' he said. 'Its [sic] outrageous. Giving a first time felon a sentence beyond their life span is pure oppression.' Jasper's letter even alleged that heavy sentences may be delivered as a result of the prison-industrial complex. 'The other side of the coin is there are those in the corporate world making money off prisoners, so the longer they're in prison, the more money is being made,' he said. 'It's not about crime & punishment, it's about crime & profit.' He later added, 'How can those that invest in prisons make money if people have sentences that will allow them to return to free society? If people were being rehabilitated and sent back into the cities, who would work for these corporations? That would be a bad investment. In order for them to make money, people have to stay in prison and keep working.' Jasper also writes that prison sentences may linked to a money-making prison-industrial complex. 'It's not about crime & punishment, it's about crime & profit' he says . Jasper's indictment described his experience of race and the judicial system, even citing the words of deceased rapper Tupac Shakur. 'When I walked into prison at 19 years old, I said to myself ""Damn, I have never seen so many black dudes in my life,""' he said. 'I mean, it looked like I went to Africa. I couldn't believe it. The lyrics of 2Pac echoed in my head, ""The penitentiary is packed/ and its filled with blacks.""' Referring to young African Americans, Jasper writes that in order to overcome inequalities they  'have to be exposed to something new' and ignore rap stars like Jay-Z and Rick Ross. 'Their minds have to be challenged, not dulled, he says. 'They know the history of the Crips & Bloods, but they can't tell you who Garvey or Robeson is. They can quote Drake & Lil Wayne but they can't tell you what Jesse Jackson or Al Sharpton has done.'","Ray Jasper, a Texas inmate scheduled to be executed later this month, shared the letter with Gawker .

"CLICK HERE to register - for FREE - and start picking your £100m squad now... As part of the build-up to the start of MailOnline's Fantasy Football season, we will be taking a look at players new to the Premier League with the potential to light up England's top tier over the coming campaign. MAURO ZARATE IN A NUTSHELL . While Andy Carroll starts another season with injury trouble, West Ham fans need not worry about a repeat of last season's striker-less shows from last season - and the reason to hold early season hope comes from the signing of Argentine striker Mauro Zarate. The hotheaded centre forward makes his return to England after a brief spell on loan at Birmingham City and whether he's a big success or not at Upton Park he'll definitely be making the headlines after controversial and mixed spells in Italy and Argentina. VIDEO Scroll down for Mauro Zarate scoring for his former club Mauro Zarate . Hard to beat: Mauro Zarate will be a nuisance for opposition defenders on his return to the Premier League . Tricky customer: Zarate breaks away from Sydney FC's Nikola Petkovic on West Ham's pre season tour . Last season Zarate sccored 18 times in 28 games for his boyhood club Velez to finish top scorer in the Argentine Torneo Final. With a goal every 123 minutes that's not a bad ratio for the Premier League and he should get better service from the likes of Mark Noble at Upton Park. And his disciplinary issues aren't too bad given his infamous hothead - he picked up just four yellow cards and hopefully he won't replicate that one red in England. WHY YOU SHOULD HAVE ZARATE IN YOUR MAILONLINE FANTASY FOOTBALL TEAM . Sam Allardyce knew as soon as the summer transfer window opened that he needed a striker - and his first move was to steal a march on the rest and snap up Zarate. One thing about this tricky frontman is he tends to hit the ground running, and with some Premier League experience already under his belt he should be in amongst the goals early at Upton Park. Back home in Argentina he has been banging in the goals and he already has one in pre season from the Hammers' New Zealand tour. His huge desire to get the East London club into Europe so he can compete at the levels he once did with Inter Milan, where he made seven Champions League appearances, should drive him on. And when Zarate wants something, he usually gets it - you just have to hope that's positive! Of course, it could all go the other way: he is known as much for his hothead as his quick feet - but Zarate should get the goals early in the season and if it subsequently goes wrong you can use up one of your first few transfers to bring in a form forward. European quality: Zarate has appeared for both Inter Milan and Lazio since leaving English shores . Prolific: Pelle scored 18 times in 28 matches for Velez during the last campaign . BACK IN ENGLAND . Zarate spent a brief period on loan at Birmingham City back in 2008 but despite becoming a fans' favourite with his explosive displays he couldn't prevent the Blues from being relegated and any chance of a move was shot down. He had spearheaded a climb away from the relegation zone similar to Carlos Tevez's that famous saved West Ham the season before - and like Tevez, Zarate attracted attention of top clubs. Arsenal were thought to be interested suitors but the striker's Qatari club Al-Sadd wanted £20million and the Gunners were priced out. During that spell he showed himself off as a two-footed and pacey forward who left defenders in bits - a promising preview to what he could show in claret and blue. Premier League old boy: Stephen Warnock tries to stop the striker during his Birmingham City days . THE DOWNSIDE . Zarate is a controversial and opinion-splitting character and his performances under Sam Allardyce could go one of two ways depending on what he thinks of his new boss. He has been seen as selfish with the ball and often attracts controversy, such as in 2010 when he was pictured making what was alleged to be a Nazi salute while at Lazio. But as earlier stated he tends to get going quickly, so get him in your team before potentially transferring him out if the Argentine is no longer flavour of the month after the first few weeks of the season. Back at home: Zarate controls the ball in a Copa Libertadores match with Velez Sarsfield . DON'T JUST TAKE OUR WORD FOR IT . Sam Allardyce has been talking up Zarate's ability - and the Premier League veteran tends to know a good striker when he sees one. 'He knows the Premier League and now he has become more experienced and more mature, he is going to have evolved in terms of giving us a few more goals in the Premier League when he gets the opportunity,' Allardyce said. 'Hopefully he is going to settle in quickly and bring us those sort of options that we need to be more successful in terms of goalscoring next season. 'He is small and sharp and quick and has got good feet, so hopefully he can give us another dimension.' Blowing a kiss: West Ham fans could be seeing Zarate celebrating a few times this season if he flourishes . HE'S A CHEAP FOR A PROVEN GOALSCORER . At £8.8m Zarate is cheap for someone proven to score Premier League goals in MailOnline's Fantasy Football game. He might be a bit of a gamble for both you and West Ham but if his latest move pays off you'll be laughing your way to the top of the league - even if that might ask a bit much of the Hammers.","Zarate agreed a three-year deal at Upton Park after moving from Argentina .

"By virtue of the fact he arrived at the club costing the square root of zero, Craig Gordon gains an exemption from the debate over Celtic’s greatest pound-for-pound signing on a technicality. Were the issue to be widened to simply the best bargain the club has ever landed, however, there is no question the 31-year-old’s name is fast approaching being used in the same breath as the likes of £650,000 Henrik Larsson and £900,000 Victor Wanyama. There’s a clear distinction to be made between the backdrop to Gordon’s arrival and that of those heroes of yesteryear. Larsson may have been unhappy and under-utilised while at Feyenoord but he had had no serious injuries at that stage. Likewise Beerschot’s emerging Kenyan powerhouse. Craig Gordon (right) returned to playing with Celtic this summer after two years out of the game with injury . The former Sunderland stopper was released by Sunderland and suffered career-threatening knee injuries . By contrast, Gordon hadn’t played a competitive game in two years. The toll of a broken arm and a knee injury sustained while at Sunderland cast a shadow – and many a question mark – over his suitability. For those critics of a transfer policy that was obviously ushering Fraser Forster to the exit door, the acquisition of a free-agent like Gordon seemed further evidence of downsizing. How wrong they have been. In the aftermath of a flawless display against Dinamo Zagreb on Thursday, Gordon’s contribution was underscored by the embraces of his grateful team-mates. The Great Wall, as the Catalan Press called the mighty Forster, may now be stationed on the South Coast but Gordon already appears to be an equally formidable barrier. So much for the old wisdom about getting nothing for free in this life. ‘I just keep trying to improve,’ he reflected. ‘I’ll do that regardless of whether I’m playing well or poorly. Gordon (centre) pulled off wonderful save after wonderful save against Dinamo Zagreb on Thursday . ‘I always want to improve my game. There have been a few difficult games especially in Europe where I’ve had to produce a few saves but that’s what I’m there for. ‘I’m feeling more comfortable every week. It’s small things like decision-making – when to come out and when to stay in – that can be more difficult sometimes than making instinctive saves. ‘It’s those small things in the game that people maybe don’t realise. They are the last things to come back when you’ve been out for so long. ‘Judging the flight of cross balls, balls over the top of the defence – when to come out and when to stay, just getting your angles right for shots from different places on the park, and just really knowing where the goal is behind you. They take time. ‘These are just little things that come with playing the position and getting games under my belt.’ As Dinamo found to their cost, Gordon’s shot-stopping powers appear to be returning to the level that persuaded Sunderland to make him Britain’s most expensive goalkeeper at £9million seven years ago. The former £9million British record goalkeeper rushes out to punch the ball clear against Dinamo Zagreb . Time and again the Croats asked questions of the giant figure clad in green but by the end of the night his heroics had demoralised them. Wilson Eduardo, their Portuguese winger, spurned five opportunities and will be seeing Gordon in his nightmares for some time to come. But if the keeper never doubted that he still had nuts and bolts in his toolbag to do the physical side of the job, he admitted he harboured concerns as to how he’d handle the mental side of returning after such a lengthy hiatus. ‘I honestly never thought it was there. But perhaps subconsciously, without really thinking about it, I had to cross a bridge psychologically,’ he added. ‘I was nervous when I first played again as I was concerned with how things would go. I still get nervous before every match but that’s getting less with every game I play now. ‘I’m just going out there and training as much as I can to try and improve.’ Little wonder Ronny Deila and his players spent the aftermath of the game praising their No 1 to the high heavens. The history books will show that Kris Commons’ sweet early strike was the difference between the teams but even the goal-scorer was anxious that the real accolades went to the man between the sticks. Gordon dives to his right and sticks out a strong arm to deny Wilson Eduardo from scoring on Thursday . Coupled with a fine opening draw in Salzburg, Deila’s men now have something tangible to build on. No matter that the season so far has felt stop-start in nature, four-points gained from sides of considerable calibre nods towards progress being made. ‘After the disappointment of going out of the Champions League, this has turned out to be another really difficult group with some real quality teams in it,’ Gordon continued. ‘I don’t think the teams we’ve played so far would be at all out of place in the Champions League. ‘In fact, the boys were saying in there that the past two games we’ve played in this competition were maybe of a higher standard than the games we played to try and qualify for the Champions League. ‘So it’s good teams we are playing against. There are no poor teams at this stage. They’re of a standard where it’s still extremely hard to get points on the board. ‘It’s a great result and one which puts is in a very strong position now. ‘We feel in the games coming up (against Astra) we can get six points to get to the 10 point mark and that would give us a great chance of going through. The Scotland international is adamant that Celtic must continue their positive form in the Europa League . ‘We’ve made a really good start but we’re taking nothing for granted. ‘We know we’ve got to go on and pick up a few more wins to make sure we get out of the group which would be a fine achievement.’ Having done the hard part, Gordon stressed how imperative it is that a promising start to the group isn’t undone in the double-header against the outsiders from Romania. ‘Something we have to be careful of is being caught on the counter-attack at home. You saw tonight that we let that happen,’ he went on. ‘We can’t take anything for granted from the two games that are coming up. ‘It’s easy to go into a game against a so-called lesser team only to lose the first goal. At this level it’s always hard to get back and then win the game. ‘We have to do what we do best and try to come out on top. Celtic and Gordon will be looking to make it four wins in a row against Hamilton in the league on Sunday . ‘If we were to get through this group it would give us something special to look forward to in the second half of the season but that’s a long way away yet.’ For the first time since Deila arrived at Celtic Park, his side have strung together three successive wins. Look closely enough and there might even be a hint of a feel-good factor emerging. For the momentum to build and for the many floating voters on the new regime to be won over though, victory against Hamilton on Sunday is mandatory. ‘They’ve been doing brilliant and have been playing some really good stuff,’ Gordon offered. ‘We’re under no illusions that’s it’s going to be a difficult game. They are up there on merit by playing some great football. ‘It’s will be a difficult game for us but it’s one we are desperate to win so we go into the international break in a better position.","Craig Gordon signed for Celtic over the summer on a free transfer .

The Himalayan Lynx is spoiled rotten by devoted owner Carol Lake, who continues to wear to the same  - very expensive- perfume every day to please Dumpty . Carol, 52, from Stafford has no children and lavishes the mollycoddled moggy with expensive bed sheets, . crystal feeding bowls and claims she can only drink bottled water. She even carries her everywhere because her paws are ‘too delicate’ to walk on anything other than the finest wool. Carol . refuses to go on holiday with husband John without the tabby’s . permission, and even has to sneak home if she is drunk because the cat . is anti-alcohol. Carol said: . 'Dumpty Roo isn’t like a normal cat. She’s very demanding and will only . accept the absolute best. Life is very much lived at the pace little . Dumpty wants and dictates, and we tailor our lives around her wants and . needs. 'To say that she is a . diva is an understatement.

Carol buys designer clothes for Dumpty and insists on carrying her on any surface that isn't the 'finest wool' to protect her paws . 'She’s . a real diva. I’m more like a 24-hour maid than her owner. But I don’t . mind, I’m just honoured that she chose me to run around after her. 'She’ll . only eat top of the range dry cat food. The more expensive the better. They say cats can’t read, but I’m sure she rummages through my receipts . to decide which offering to turn her nose up at based on price.' As a customer services worker, Carol’s wage doesn’t quite stretch to cover 13-year-old Dumpty Roo’s lavish lifestyle.

But despite the spoilt tabby’s demands, Carol insists she is worth every effort - and is ‘honoured’ to be around her. While . Carol’s other rescue cat Willi Whizkas often chooses to spend nights . out in the garden, Dumpty Roo will only sleep on her owner’s bed. Carol said she is lucky to be given a corner of the bed at night and is often woken by her feline bedfellow. She . said: 'When she arrived I had to buy all new bed sheets. She likes Lulu .

"Ronny Deila told Neil Lennon that he had every right to demand better standards of fitness and nutrition at Celtic after replacing him as manager. The Norwegian has launched a crackdown on chips and fizzy drinks at the club’s Lennoxtown training base. And, in an impassioned defence of his methods ahead of tonight’s Europa League clash with Dinamo Zagreb at Parkhead, Deila said he must change the culture and eating habits of the Scottish champions to keep pace with Europe’s top clubs. Without mentioning Deila by name, former manager Lennon had queried his changes in a recent radio interview, saying: ‘It’s disrespectful when a new manager comes in and immediately says: “The players aren’t fit enough”.’ Ronny Deila said he was well within his rights to demand a higher level of fitness from his Celtic players . However, citing Andy Murray as the example his players have to learn from, Deila said: ‘When I see the tests players are doing I see they have a lot to improve. ‘It’s not about what they were doing before. It’s all about how they are in the moment now. ‘Maybe I see things differently from what Neil (Lennon) was doing. ‘For me, to be professional is to be a 24-hour athlete. If not, then you can go and start working outside football. That’s not so hard. You can be amateurs again. ‘If Neil gets irritated by me saying we can work on how we eat and improve, that’ s up to him. ‘For me, I think from what I have seen abroad and what I have experienced myself it’s important. We just have different ways to do it.’ Ronny Deila has launched a crackdown on chips and fizzy drinks at Celtic's Lennoxtown training base . Neil Lennon said it was disrespectful for a new manager to come in and demand a better level of fitness . After a troubled start to his Celtic career, Deila earned the public backing of major shareholder Dermot Desmond this week and added: ‘Dermot and Peter (Lawwell) are very intelligent. They have seen football for many, many years. They know how to build things. ‘They wanted a change and that’s why I came in. If not, they would have gone for a manager with much more experience and would have done it more like it was done before. ‘It’s a club thing, they are going in a new direction. That’s why I’m here. You have to keep on and I believe in what I am doing. ‘I know the process is taking time, but I believe in it and I know I have the people with me to do it.’ With John Guidetti ineligible to play until the Europa League knock-out stages, Deila must reshape his attacking options against the Croatian champions. Dinamo Zagreb train at Celtic Park on Wednesday ahead of their Europa League clash against Celtic . Setting a target of three home wins from Group D after a 2-2 draw in Salzburg, Deila would have been encouraged to see Kris Commons and Stefan Scepovic train on Wednesday after weekend knocks. Commons looks the more likely option to link up with Anthony Stokes after an indifferent start by new £2.2million signing Scepovic. Calling for supporters to be patient with the Serb, Deila insisted: ‘I talk to my players all the time. We look at what is positive and what is negative after every game. He is a very clever boy. ‘He knows he has to adapt to that kind of play. But I think the level in the Second Division in Spain is at least the same as it is here in Scotland. He knows he can score goals. I see his movement and I know goals will come. ‘But he has come to a new country, to a team with new players, he hasn’t played in a long while and there are big expectations. We have to be a little bit patient.’","Ronny Deila demanded a higher level of fitness from Celtic team .

"Reggie Brown says newly released evidence proves why he's called ‘The Third Winkelvoss’ in the lawsuit worth $267 million against Snapchat, a photo sharing app he says he thought up before friends shut him out. Now the company is worth $800 million and while Brown's former Stanford classmates and Snapchat founders Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy admit he first came up with the idea, they say he had no part in creating the massively popular company. Photos of the trio together, emails, and text message exchanges are all proof, Brown claims, that he deserves hundreds of millions. Stolen: Frank Reginald Brown IV, seen left, has filed a lawsuit against company Snapchat as well as its co-founders Bobby Murphy and Evan Spiegel, seen right, alleging they stole his idea for the program . Value: Analysts have valued the company that uses this ghost as its logo at $800 million . It began at a home in Pacific Palisades area of Los Angeles in 2011, reports Business Insider. Brown, an English major, decided to spend the summer there at the home of Spiegel, his friend from Stanford. Earlier that spring, Snapchat now admits in the suit, Brown came up with the idea of a disappearing photo app. But that's where the two parties' stories part ways. 'From spring of 2011 and into the summer,' reads Brown's filing, '[Brown] and Spiegel and Murphy lived, worked, developed and launched the Application together.' Proof? Text messages between plaintiff Reggie Brown and Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel allegedly help prove Brown was an integral part of the formation of Snapchat . Tenacious: Brown has moved on from Stanford, but the English major has not let go of claims he helped found Snapchat . The setting: The creation of Snapchat and subsequent alleged betrayal all took place at Spiegel's Pacific Palisades home, pictured, in 2011 . Some evidence seems back up this claim. A saved text message conversation between Brown and Spiegel suggests Brown helped secure the company's first patent. Another makes the group look like the three-man startup Brown's suit claims they were. 'No chance we're celebrating wo you bro,' reads a message from Speigel to Brown. But that's exactly what Spiegel and Murphy are now doing. Snapchat has become one of the world's fastest growing internet services of all time and estimates list its worth at a whopping $800 million. Brown's lawyers have also presented evidence that the Stanford grad overheard a conversation between his two former friends about how they intended to excise him from the company. Meanwhile, Snapchat contends--along with CEO Evan Spiegel and CTO Bobby Murphy, who each pocketed $10 million as part of the company's fundraising efforts--Brown had 'no equity' in the venture. Friends? Brown says he deserves a third of the $800 million smash hit iPhone app, but the defense says the Stanford English major had no equity in their company . No one denies that, at some point in the summer of 2011, things went sour and Spiegel and Murphy changed the passwords to the servers and shut Brown out. Brown was then horrified when he saw Snapchat become a huge hit with 60 million pictures now being shared every day via the service, more even than Facebook-owned Instagram. Brown’s claims echo those of twins Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, who say that Mark Zuckerberg stole the idea for Facebook from them whilst they were all at Harvard. They were given $65 million in a settlement but spent four years trying in vain to get more, with their story being dramatised in the film The Social Network which was about the birth of Facebook. Snapchat lets users send photos to each other which will then be deleted after a certain period of time, typically 10 seconds. It lets people send embarrassing pictures without the worry they will be saved forever. Happier times: In September Snapchat celebrated their one-year anniversary and so had a new cake but Frank Reginald Brown was visibly not around to share it . New team: The Snapchat team posted a picture of themselves in Norway last fall, left, as well as one of the team members playing with their app, right, five months before the lawsuit was filed against them . Brown, 23, alleges that he came up with the concept before going to Spiegel, who called it a ‘million-dollar idea’. They supposedly agreed to work together and looked for somebody to write the code, so chose Murphy. The trio moved into Spiegel’s father’s house in Los Angeles where they worked on the app in the summer of 2011, the lawsuit states. Brown claims he came up with the ghost logo and the original name, Picaboo, which the trio used in the launch of July that year. The following month however they had a falling out and the lawsuit states that Brown was locked out and the other two refused to talk to him. The falling out took place in August. In September, Snapchat was launched. Twins? Twins Cameron Winklevoss and Tyler Winklevoss, left, were given a $65million settlement after their claimed part in Facebook despite the denials of founder Mark Zuckerberg, right . As part of his claim Brown included a photo of all three men by a cake with the Snapchat logo on it, the Los Angeles Times reported. Brown's lawyer Luan Tran told the paper: ‘He wants his share of what he is entitled to’. The claims of start-up skulduggery will be all too familiar to the Winklevoss brothers, who were dubbed the ‘Wiklevii’ in The Social Network. It was in 2003 that they claimed they asked Zuckerberg to write the code on their own social network, called Harvard Connection. They alleged that he then started his own rival called thefacebook.com which went on to become the biggest website of its kind in the world with more than one billion users. Whilst they were given their $65 million settlement Zuckerberg has gone on to become one of the richest men in the world. According to the latest Forbes rankings, he is the 35th richest man on Earth with a fortune of $17.5billion, although he was far wealthier before Facebook’s bungled stock market floatation. A representative for Snapchat said: ‘We are aware of the allegations, believe them to be utterly devoid of merit, and will vigorously defend ourselves against this frivolous suit. ‘It would be inappropriate to comment further on this pending legal matter.’","Frank Reginald 'Reggie' Brown stands to win $267 million .

"IT has been widely acknowledged that the new Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has had a good World Cup but at the Maracana on Sunday night there might yet be one player who could embarrass him, even though Holland departed the tournament on Saturday. Toni Kroos, the playmaker in the German midfield, is in the form of his life. Although Germany’s semi-final performance against Brazil has been rightly acknowledged as an extraordinary team effort, if there was one player who provided the nexus for all that slick passing and crisp finishing, it was Kroos. VIDEO Scroll down to watch United target Toni Kroos' best Bundesliga goals . Threat: Germany's Toni Kroos celebrates scoring against Brazil in World Cup semi-final . ‘Like Xavi and Iniesta rolled into one,’ said the usually conservative . newspaper, Sud-deutsche Zeitung, of his performance, and they were not . far off the mark. But Kroos is off to Real Madrid this summer, even . though Manchester United were initially in the forefront of the race to . sign him. David Moyes was confident that the player would come and other . sources at United confirm that there was an excellent chance of him . joining. Van Gaal’s appointment saw a change in tack, however. Getting players out of Bayern Munich is never easy but Van Gaal, who . coached there from 2009-2011 and knows most of the squad well —including . Kroos — was clear about his preferred players from their pool: Thomas . Muller and Bastian Schweinsteiger. Muller has since signed a new . contract with Bayern but recruiting Schweinsteiger is still a . possibility, though the uncharacteristically calamitous manner in which . Bayern have handled Kroos’s contract negotiations may mean that they do . not want to let another star man go. For Kroos has been something of . an outsider, both at Bayern and in German football, until now. Even a . week ago, as his influence on the World Cup grew, there was still a . sense of him having to prove  something to those back home. ‘I hope . I’ve given a few doubts to those who say: “You can’t count on Kroos in . big games”,’ he said. ‘I want to produce something special at this World . Cup. Influence: Bayern's Toni Kroos brings traditional virtues to the Germany midfield . ‘I can’t afford to relax. World class or not, what is important to . me is that I’m at a higher level than I was a few years ago and that I . maintain the level that I showed for Bayern Munich this season. I’m a . different player — busier on the pitch and more dominant.’ He has . achieved all that and more with his performances against France and . Brazil. Kroos may well be the best midfielder in the world right now, . which makes it all the more puzzling that Van Gaal has not pursued the . deal. It is always possible that once Real Madrid became involved, . United would have been gazumped anyway. But it is clear that United were . a long way down the line towards persuading him to join. Perhaps . Van Gaal has memories of the old Kroos: the one who was blamed for . letting Italy’s Andrea Pirlo run the game in the Euro 2012 semi-final, . which Germany lost; the one who missed a late chance in the 2010 World . Cup semi-final against Spain when he came on as a substitute; the one . whose midfield tactical sense was questioned after the 2012 World Cup . qualifier in Berlin in which Germany led Sweden 4-0 with 28 minutes to . play, only to surrender initiative and end up drawing 4-4. Certainly . it is said that Kroos responded much better to the more avuncular . management style of his early coach at Bayern, Ottmar Hitzfeld, than the . abrasive Van Gaal. Indeed, until recently he never seemed to be part of . the inner core of the Bayern team and that is precisely why the club is . on the verge of losing him now. Kroos decided he deserved to be paid a . salary ranking alongside the Bayern aristocrats such as Schweinsteiger . and Philipp Lahm of around £8 million a year, and went public in his . observation. Snub: Kroos has impressed in Brazil but not enough to convince Louis van Gaal to sign him for Manchester United . For Bayern, that was a violation of the unwritten club code that you bide your time and work your way up the hierarchy. They offered him around £6m, seeing him as a very good club player but not one of the best in the world. Although his coach Pep Guardiola enthused about him, the club were continuing to treat him like a naughty boy, as recently as March, when the prevailing attitude was that he would be held to his contract until 2015 and then released on a free, rather than be sold. The logic was that they needed to make an example of him to other players to demonstrate that his behaviour was not acceptable. While some at  Bayern hope that they might persuade him to stay, that there is still a one per cent chance of getting him to sign up beyond 2015. Too late, it seems. Kroos, transformed from an outsider to the cornerstone of the national team, has settled on Real Madrid. It is an extraordinary example of mismanagement by Bayern, though not unique. Mats Hummels, another star of this German team, was once at Bayern before they let him go to Borussia Dortmund. But Kroos had all the credentials to be at the heart of Bayern for years. He was homegrown, joining them at the age of 16 from the far-flung village of Greifswald, on the Baltic Sea in what was the old East Germany. Born in 1990, the year of unification, he is the first generation of ‘Ossis’ (former residents of East Germany) to have no experience the old state. His mother, Birgit, was East German badminton champion, a formidable achievement in a state in which success at sport was considered one of the most important criteria. His father, Roland, is a youth team coach with Hansa Rostock and his brother Felix plays for Werder Bremen. Focused: Germany's coach Joachim Low keeps close eye on Toni Kroos and Miroslav Klose during training . He burst on the scene at Bayern Munich, a wunderkind at 17, becoming the youngest player at the time to make his professional debut for the club, against Energie Cottbus. He thrived under Hitzfeld, but not under Jurgen Klinsmann, and was loaned to Bayer Leverkusen. Van Gaal recalled him but only under Jupp Heynckes and Guardiola has he prospered. He understands his role precisely. ‘I know that my job is to give the team clarity and security with the ball,’ he said during the World Cup, though the actual German phrase he used was: ‘I know that I’m predestined to give the team clarity and security.’ There is an intensity  and seriousness about the way he describes the role; it also suggests that however strong the lingering Communist influences of his upbringing in East Germany, it failed to eradicate Lutheran values. Though he left school at 16 and was not the most enthusiastic  student — knowing that he had a Bayern contract lined up could not have helped — he speaks excellent English. As for today’s final, despite the extraordinary nature of the performance against Brazil, there is a little danger of him or any of the Germans getting carried away. ‘The feeling in the dressing-room wasn’t euphoric,’ said Kroos, reflecting on the 7-1 demolition of Brazil. ‘We’re all totally focused now on the chance that we have. We’re quite clear that we have come here with aim of becoming world champions. And World Cups are not decided in semi-finals. We know that it was just one game in the plan to achieve our goal.’One more game and they could be there; and Kroos will be acknowledged among the world’s best.","Toni Kroos has been in fine form for Germany throughout the World Cup .

"Google is now lobbying officials in at least three states to stop proposed restrictions on driving with headsets such as Google Glass. Some eight U.S. states are considering regulation of the company’s new product- a tiny computer screen mounted in the corner of an eyeglass frame. Law enforcement and other groups are concerned that drivers wearing the devices will pay more attention to their email than the road, causing serious accidents. Pre-emptive precaution: Google Glass is not yet on the open market but bans against the new technology, as modeled here by Google CEO Sergey Brin, could cause problems for the gadget's roll-out . So-called wearables such as Google Glass, smart watches and sophisticated health devices may represent the next big shift in technology, just as smartphones evolved from personal computers, and enthusiasts predict billion-dollar markets. Google, which is still testing Glass, charges $1,500 per pair. Google Inc has deployed lobbyists to persuade elected officials in Illinois, Delaware and Missouri that it is not necessary to restrict use of Google Glass behind the wheel, according to state lobbying disclosure records and interviews conducted by Reuters. Legislators who introduced similar bills this year in three other states, New York, Maryland and West Virginia, say they have not yet been contacted by Google. Officials in New Jersey and Wyoming did not respond to inquiries from Reuters. Last month in San Diego, for instance, a woman's traffic ticket for wearing Google Glass behind the wheel was dismissed because there was no proof the device was operating at the time. Google's main point to legislators is that regulation would be premature because Google Glass is not yet widely available, the state elected officials say. Other issues: Sarah Slocum (right) was reportedly attacked in a San Francisco bar for wearing the $1,500 glasses . Illinois state Senator Ira Silverstein, a Chicago Democrat who introduced a Google Glass restriction bill in December, responded that it was clear the merchandise was heading for the broader public. 'Who are they fooling?' Silverstein said he recently met with Google lobbyists trying to 'kill' the bill, a position Silverstein suggested is driven by market considerations for the company. State records show the month after Silverstein introduced his bill, Google retained John Borovicka, a former political director for President Obama's former chief of staff and current Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel. Borovicka visited Silverstein to lobby against the legislation, the state senator said. Asked about its lobbying efforts, Google said tech issues are a big part of current policy discussions in the states. 'We think it is important to be part of those discussions,' the company said in a statement. Google has been scheduling Glass demonstrations across the country in an effort to educate the public on how the technology works. 'While Glass is currently in the hands of a small group of Explorers,  find that when people try it for themselves they better understand the underlying principle that it's not meant to distract but rather connect people more with the world around them,' the company said in a statement. Driving distraction: Lawmakers fear that the Glass will pose similar dangers as texting while driving . Campaigns against distracted driving have gained significant traction in the United States. In 2012, over 3,000 people died due to crashes where texting or other activities were in play, according to Distraction.gov, a U.S. government web site devoted to the issue. Delaware state Rep. Joseph Miro was one of the primary sponsors of a bill that banned texting while driving, and he also introduced legislation targeting Google Glass. So far, no states have passed Google Glass restrictions. 'I'm not against Google or Google Glass. It may have a place in society,' said Miro, a Republican. 'My issue is that while you are driving, you should have nothing that is going to impede the concentration of the driver.' According to Miro, a Google representative lobbied against the bill by forwarding a news article about the San Diego court case, as an attempt to show that the courts are taking a dim view towards prosecutions. His bill passed committee and could receive a floor vote this spring, Miro said. Google advises people engaged in Glass field tests to abide by state laws that limit use of mobile devices while driving. 'Above all, even when you're following the law, don't hurt yourself or others by failing to pay attention to the road,' the company said in guidance posted online. Not all legislators pushing a Google Glass restriction have been visited by the company, however. In West Virginia, House of Delegates member Gary Howell, a Republican, said he has heard from out-of-state Google Glass users opposed to the bill but not from the company itself. For Maryland House of Delegates member Benjamin Kramer, the San Diego traffic case shows a need for clear state laws. When a driver is pulled over, it will always be extremely difficult for law enforcement to prove whether Google Glass had been operating, said Kramer, a Democrat. 'The way to get around it is just to prohibit them altogether,' he said.","Lobbyists have contacted lawmakers in Illinois, Missouri and Delaware over proposed bans that would stop drivers from wearing Google Glass .
Similar proposals have been discussed in New York, Maryland, West Virginia, New Jersey and Wyoming .
Lawmakers fear the small computer screens attached to glasses will prove to be a dangerous- and perhaps fatal- distraction for drivers .
The new technology is not yet available for public purchase but is set to be more widely available soon ."
"Croatia legend Robert Prosinecki has warned former club Dinamo Zagreb it would foolish to underestimate Celtic after detecting hints of complacency in his homeland. The Parkhead outfit’s two Champions League exits to Legia Warsaw and Maribor have convinced some in the Croatian media that Ronny Deila’s men are there for the taking in Glasgow on Thursday. But ex-Real Madrid and Barcelona playmaker Prosinecki pointed out that Dinamo are a shadow of the side they were in his 1990s heyday - and believes Celtic will be formidable opponents as they seek the victory he feels will leave them on the cusp of qualifying for the knockout stages of the Europa League.

Celtic boss Ronny Deila will be hoping his side can spring a surprise on the Croatians . ‘I keep reading stories in Croatia that Celtic are weak these days just because of what happened against Legia Warsaw and because Maribor beat them,’ said the 45-year-old, part of a Dinamo team who lost 1-0 to Celtic in a Champions League qualifier in 1998 but went on to crush them 3-0 in Zagreb. ‘They are not - and Dinamo don’t have the same standard as team as when we last played Celtic. ‘If Celtic’s stadium is close to being full, it will be a very, very tough night for Dinamo. ‘Celtic took a point in Austria against Salzburg and they know if they can win, this will be a key outcome for them. It will almost guarantee their qualification.’ The former Yugoslavia and Croatia midfielder, who had two spells with Dinamo before managing Red Star Belgrade, recalled his own trip to Parkhead, saying: ‘We lost 1-0 in Glasgow. We were the better team and missed two great chances, but in football the better team doesn’t always win. ‘But after that game we were very confident of beating them and we were spectacular in Zagreb. ‘We justified our self-confidence and absolutely overran them. The Maksimir Stadium was full and the atmosphere was incredible. It was a great night. Celtic crashed out of the Champions League to Maribor, despite a second bite at the cherry . ‘The final stats were 24 shots to three in our favour. We were a really good team. “But it’s hard to win at Celtic Park and Dinamo had better not underestimate the Scots. They must not think this will be easy. However, if they can come away from Glasgow undefeated, they have a great chance of remaining in Europe after Christmas for the first time.’ Meanwhile, Police Scotland are investigating an allegation by Celtic defender Virgil van Dijk that he was racially abused by a fan during his side’s 2-1 win at St Mirren on Saturday. A statement from Police Scotland read: ‘We have received a complaint from a Celtic player alleging he was racially abused by a spectator during the St Mirren v Celtic match on Saturday. Police are liaising with both clubs and are analysing broadcast and CCTV footage. Enquiries are ongoing.’ St Mirren last night pledged to co-operate in any police investigation but the club declined to comment further. In a separate matter, the SFA have confirmed that a principal hearing into allegations that Celtic winger Aleksandar Tonev used racist language during a game against Aberdeen earlier this month has been rescheduled for October 30 because of his inclusion in the Bulgarian international squad for European qualifiers against Croatia and Norway .","Croatian legend Prosinecki says Ronny Deila's side can spring a surprise .

"Dinamo Zagreb manager Zoran Mamic got his Old Firm clubs mixed up ahead of the Europa League clash with Celtic at Parkhead on Thursday night. At his press conference at Celtic Park, the Croatian waxed lyrical about previously playing at the stadium, saying, via an interpreter: 'I played here 15 /16 years ago. 'I remember that game well. 'I have save said before I don't remember a better atmosphere in my career than at Celtic Park. 'It is a huge privilege to play against Celtic with such a great team and we will do our best.' Dinamo Zagreb head coach Zoran Mamic confused his Old Firm clubs at a press conference . Zoran Mamic said he loved the atmosphere at Celtic Park, but never played there . However, Mamic has never played at Celtic Park but was an unused substitute when Bayern Leverkusen played the Hoops' traditional rivals Rangers at Ibrox when the two sides drew 1-1 in a UEFA Cup tie in 1998. Afterwards, he admitted his error to Press Association, saying: 'It was a mistake, it was Rangers.' Mamic will hope this trip to Glasgow is unforgettable. His side thrashed Astra 5-1 in their Group D opener while Ronny Deila's team drew 2-2 draw with Red Bull Salzburg in Austria. The Scottish champions struggled in the early part of the season, effectively being knocked out of the Champions League qualifiers twice. Dinamo Zagreb train at Celtic Park ahead of the Europa League tie against Celtic . However, Mamic reads nothing into those setbacks for the Hoops and agrees with Deila that 10 points should be enough to get out of the group. He said: 'Celtic's results may not be as good as Celtic fans would like them to be but we still respect them. 'We won't underestimate Celtic's ability to play well and we have to play better than in our last game against Astra. 'I think 10 points should be enough to go through to the next round. The group is very challenging. 'All the clubs are the same quality and everyone can beat everyone else. 'We have had a good season so far although we missed the chance to qualify for the Champions League. Dinamo Zagreb players train at Celtic Park the day before they face Celtic in the Europa League . 'We will do our best to gain as much experience during this competition and collect as many points as we can.' Zagreb midfielder Domagoj Antolic believes Celtic are favourites going into the game but vowed that the Croatian side will to put up a fight. He said: 'We have been preparing for this for a long time and we have watched videos of their games. 'Surely Celtic are favourites in this match but we are not going to raise the white flag too soon. 'We will try to play our game and see what happens.'","Mamic reflected on the brilliant atmosphere when he played at Celtic Park .

The 20-year-old Chile international will face Glasgow giants Celtic in the Europa League on Thursday evening, as he turns out for loan employers Dinamo Zagreb - where he will spend the season on loan from the Red Devils.

"Travelling through time may not be the far-fetched science fiction theory it was once thought to be, according to Professor Brian Cox. Speaking at the British Science Festival, Cox declared to the audience: 'Can you build a time machine? The answer is yes.' However, the theory only works when travelling to the future, and Cox explained that once in the future it's not possible to come back. Professor Brian Cox, pictured left, explained to an audience at the British Science Festival that time travel is possible, based on Einstein's Theory of Special Relativity. In theory, if technology was developed that could transport large objects close to the speed of light, humans could travel like Doctor Who in his tardis, right . Professor Cox is set to give a scientific talk on the theory of time travel to mark the 50th anniversary of Doctor Who in London next week. The talk will form part of a set of anniversary shows that will be shown before the BBC's Day of Doctor episode on 23 November. During his speech at the Birmingham-based science festival, Cox said time travel has already been done, on a very small scale. He added that if the technology was developed to accelerate larger objects, it could be possible for humans to travel to the future, similar to Doctor Who's Tardis in the TV show. Yet this technology doesn't exist yet, and will never exist that could take people to the past. Cox told the audience that  Einstein's Theory of Special Relatively states to travel forward in time, an object needs to reach speeds close to the speed of light. As it approaches these speeds, time slows down but only for that specific object. It's impossible to travel to the past, though, as seen in Back to the Future, pictured . 'You can go into . the future; you've got almost total freedom of movement in the future,' said Cox. This means that Marty McFly in Back to the Future science fiction film trilogy could have travelled to 2015. Einstein’s theory of relativity was based on two principles. These . include the principle of relativity,  which states that the laws of . physics don’t change, even when objects move at constant speeds relative . to each other. It also looked at the principle of the speed of light. Einstein . observed that the speed of light is the same for everyone, regardless . of how their movement related to the light source. Einstein's . theory explains that if two objects are moving through space and want . to compare what they can see, the only thing that matters and helps . determine this comparison is how fast the two objects are moving . relative to each other. The special theory specifically includes movement in a straight or uniform line at a constant speed. If an object starts travelling faster, curves, or veers off course, the special relatively no longer applies. However, he wouldn't have been able to return to 1985, or travel back to 1955 like he does in the first film. 'If you go fast, your clock runs slow relative to people who are still. 'As you approach the speed of light, your clock runs so slow you could . come back 10,000 years in the future.' The theory is based on Einstein's Theory of Special Relatively that states to travel forward in time, an object would need to reach speeds close to the speed of light. As an object approach these speeds, time slows down but only for that specific object travelling. For example, people flying over the Atlantic will experience time passing marginally slower than people on the ground. 'In General Relativity, you can do it in principle,' continued Cox. 'It's to do with . building these things called wormholes; shortcuts through space and . time. But most physicists doubt it. 'Hawking came up with the 'chronology . protection conjecture' - physics we don't yet understand that means . wormholes are not stable.'","Professor Cox made the claims at the British Science Festival .
He explained time travel has already taken place, but on a very small scale .
The closer someone travels to the speed of light, the more time slows .
If time slows to a significant amount it could transport that person 'thousands of years into the future'"
"Casey Anthony’s father today denied accusations that he had an affair with one of the volunteers who helped to search for his missing grand-daughter. Crystal Holloway, 39, has told investigators that George Anthony visited her apartment for romantic trysts in 2008 and confessed to her that his two-year-old grand-daughter Caylee had died as a result of 'an accident that snowballed out of control'. Mr Anthony denied the allegations as 'very funny' during sworn testimony in court in Orlando, Florida - where his daughter is on trial for Caylee’s 2008 murder - telling jurors that Ms Holloway was a woman with a 'questionable past' who he befriended out of compassion after she told him that she had a brain tumour. Stern: Casey Anthony's father George Anthony testified at his daughter's murder trial at the Orange County Courthouse in Orlando, Florida today - denying any romantic involvement with Crystal Holloway . Bombshell: Crystal Holloway (left) told investigators George Anthony (right) visited her apartment for romantic trysts in 2008 while she was helping to search for his grand-daughter . The two first met in October 2008 when Ms Holloway, who also goes by the name of River Cruz, came to a command centre set up by Mr Anthony and his wife Cindy in collaboration with Texas Equusearch, an organisation that coordinates hunts for missing people. Mr Anthony said that he 'sometimes maybe considered her a friend or someone who was going to be helping find our grand-daughter' and that he visited her at her home two or three times, with his wife’s knowledge. 'The very first time, I was in there because we had a conversation in which she relayed to me probably weeks or just a few days prior…that she has a brain tumour, she was dying, she needed someone to comfort her.' Being 'a good guy', he had offered her his support, he said. He also said he never told Holloway that he grabbed Casey by the throat, threw her against a wall and demanded Casey tell him where Caylee was. On trial: Casey Anthony and her attorney Jose Baez listen during testimony today. Anthony is standing trial on first-degree muder, accused by prosecutors of killing her two-year-old daughter in 2008 . 'I felt that she was so giving of . herself, to me and my family, to help look for our grand-daughter, it . was the least I could do to go in and show some compassion and respect,' he testified. 'To . say that I had said something to her… that something might have . ""snowballed out of control"", that was never there,' he insisted, . admitting that he may have sent Ms Holloway text messages saying that he . needed her in his life, but adding that many volunteers became like . family. 'I sent text messages to many, many volunteers…and yes, I did need those people in my life,' he said. 'I have nothing to hide.' Speaking calmly but firmly, he denied suggestions by defence lawyer Cheney Mason that he had been 'intimate' with the volunteer. On the stand: Casey Anthony's mother Cindy Mrs Anthony denied in court today that she had dispatched the private investigators to search the wooded area where her grand-daughter's body was found . Testimony: Casey's brother Lee Anthony said he argued with his mother after Caylee's disappearance about sending investigators into the woods . 'I never had a romantic affair with . Crystal Holloway, River Cruz or whatever names she ever wanted to give . you or the world. If I’m not mistaken, sir, she has a questionable past, . OK? She also had been arrested for fraud, breaking and entering, and . things like that. She’s not a good person, sir,' he said. Caylee’s . remains were found in swampy woodland near the Anthony family’s home in . December 2008. Five months previously, her grandmother had reported her . missing after growing suspicious about the little girl’s month-long . absence and Anthony’s repeated claims that the child was simply away . staying with a nanny. After . being challenged about her story by her mother and sheriff’s deputies, . Anthony changed her story, claiming that Caylee had been kidnapped by . the nanny. Revealed: Defence attorney Cheney Mason (left) hands paperwork to Roy Kronk, who said he called police in August, 2008 after he saw a possible human skull near the Anthony home . Volunteer: Joe Jordan, a worker with Texas EquuSearch, testified in the Casey Anthony murder trial today as Casey's father denied having an affair with his colleague . When her trial opened five weeks ago, her lawyer admitted that the nanny was one of several 'imaginary friends' Anthony had invented, and set out a new version of events: Caylee drowned accidentally in the family pool on June 16, 2008 and was fished out by her grandfather, who disposed of the body secretly and told his daughter never to reveal what had happened. Anthony claims that she complied . because she had been conditioned to obey and lie for her father as a . result of him sexually abusing her as a child. Mr Anthony denies the . accusations. Anthony’s . defence team is arguing that Caylee’s remains were only dumped in the . area a short while before they were found in December 2008, calling . several witnesses to try to back their claim. But several proved of more . value to the prosecution, including an Equusearch 'team leader' who . testified that sections of the woodland could not be explored because . they were waterlogged - water that prosecutors say later dried to reveal . Caylee’s remains. Photo evidence: An image showing the wooded area where Caylee Anthony's remains were found in December, 2008 . Under questioning by the defence, Mrs Anthony denied in court today that she had despatched the private investigators to search that area. 'I never sent those guys there,' she said. But her son Lee contradicted his . mother when called to the stand, revealing that he had had an argument . with his mother in late 2008 over her decision to send the private . investigators into the woods based on a tip from a psychic that the . child was dead. 'I was . quite angry. It was the first time I had ever heard anyone in my family . offer it up that they were willing to look for a deceased Caylee. Before . that, not in the realm of anybody’s mindset,' he said. 'I . was very angry that my folks decided to do that without keeping me in . the loop. I couldn’t believe that they could be even considering that . Caylee may no longer be with us.' Victim: Anthony, 25, has pleaded not guilty to killing two-year-old Caylee in the summer of 2008 . Roy Kronk, a meter reader working near the Anthony family home in Orlando on August 11, 2008, testified that he saw 'something that appeared a little odd' when he stepped into the woods that day to relieve himself. But when police officers arrived there they seemed more 'enthralled' by a dead rattlesnake and failed to check the mystery object, which he said 'appeared to look like a human skull.' 'Everything became about the dead snake,' he said, explaining the officers’ visit. It was not until another call in December that Caylee’s remains were found. The defence, in its opening statement, has alluded to Mr Kronk as a 'morally bankrupt' publicity-seeker, who they suggested had somehow obtained Caylee’s remains then planted them in the woods to reap a $225,000 reward. He has denied the claim. Defence attempts to portray Mr Kronk as a villainous schemer failed to gain traction in court as recordings of three 911 calls that he made on August 11, 12 and 13, 2008, were played to jurors, illustrating how he repeatedly tried to draw investigators' attention to something 'odd' in the woods without success. On the third call-out, he said, a deputy from Orange County Sheriff's Department came to meet him at the woods but failed to conduct a thorough search. 'He went down to the waterline, did this, did this, slipped on the mud then chewed me out for a half hour,' he said, turning his head one way and then another to demonstrate how the officer carried out only a glancing search of the waterlogged area before giving up. The deputy has since been fired. On December 11, with Caylee still missing, Mr Kronk returned to the woods - where the water level had now dried up - and walked up to the mystery object for the first time. He discovered that it was a skull. Unsure whether it was real, he poked a stick through the eye socket to inspect it more thoroughly. 'I gently pivoted it up, I never took it off the ground,' he stressed. 'That was a very horrific thing for me to find.' The missed opportunities to find Caylee's remains may have meant the loss of vital forensic clues. Mr Kronk stated that he was angry that the site had not been properly investigated when he called 911 four months earlier and that he had been treated like a time-waster and a liar. 'I just simply tried to do the right thing and for my efforts to do the right thing and be a good citizen I basically got chewed up and called horrendous things...yeah, I was pretty pissed off about that,' he said. The trial continues.","Meter reader who found Caylee's remains also testified today, saying that deputies did not search the area properly after he called 911 three times ."
"A drug taken by millions of people to relieve heartburn and nausea is set to be restricted after nearly 60 people died from heart problems after taking the medication. Following a European review, domperidone, also known as Motilium is to be curtailed after it found 57 people are known to have died. It is thought the medication can disturb the heart's rhythm and electrical activity as well as causing other side effects such as convulsions, insomnia and anxiety. Scroll down for video . Domperidone, also known as Motilium is to be restricted following a European review, which found 57 people died from heart problems while taking the drug . There were also a further 342 reports of people suffering serious side effects after being prescribed domperidone. This has prompted the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to update their advice on the drug and will now only be given to those suffering from nausea and vomiting only. It is thought around two million people in England take the medication each year for symptoms such as heartburn, nausea and gastrointestinal reflux. Domperidone will now only be given to those suffering from nausea and vomiting only, and not heartburn . It relieves stomach discomfort and the sensation of fullness by increasing the action of the muscles in the gastrointestinal tract so that food moves more effectively through the digestive system. It can also be taken for conditions caused by food staying in one place for too long or by stomach contents flowing the wrong way along the gastrointestinal tract. Domperidone is also often prescribed by GPs from babies suffering from severe reflux, but only once the doctor is satisfied they do not have a heart condition . The deputy director of the MHRA's vigilance and risk management of medicines division, Dr Sarah Branch told the Telegraph: 'The review concluded that the benefits outweigh the risks of using domperidone when used to treat nausea and vomiting but that there should be restrictions on its use. 'It should no longer be used for symptoms of abdominal discomfort such as heartburn and feelings of fullness. 'There is no need to stop taking your medicine. However, if you have an underlying heart condition or have any other questions, please speak to your doctor or pharmacist at your next routine visit.' The injectable form of the domperidone was withdrawn in 1985 due to its side effects.","Domperidone taken by 2million in England to relieve heartburn to be curtailed .

"Victoria Luckwell, pictured at the High Court, has been ordered to hand over £1million to her ex-husband Frankie Limata so he can buy a house . The daughter of one of Britain’s richest men warned that a gold-digger’s charter had been created yesterday after she lost a bitter High Court divorce battle. Victoria Luckwell said there was now a strong disincentive for wealthy women to marry after being ordered to pay more than £1million to estranged husband Frankie Limata. Mr Limata, who signed a pre-nuptial agreement, had demanded a £2.2million share of the value of their £6.6million marital home in London. Miss Luckwell’s father Mike, who was the director of the media company that created children’s programme Bob the Builder, had previously threatened to cut off his daughter financially if Mr Limata received one penny – he has been paying her a £100,000-a-year allowance and her three children’s private school fees. After the judgment, Miss Luckwell, 37, confirmed that her 71-year-old father, who has a £135million fortune, would stick to his vow and she will have to sell her house and raise her children on her own. She said ‘important public policy considerations’ arose from the case, adding: ‘Unless Parliament enacts the recent Law Commission’s proposals on nuptial agreements, the law will remain in a state of uncertainty. This results in very costly and public hearings as well as enormous emotional distress and financial uncertainty. My recent experience is exactly what nuptial agreements are designed to eliminate. ‘Sadly, I’m left to conclude there is a strong financial disincentive for a wealthy woman to marry if she cannot be assured of protecting her family’s assets. Simply put, this is a gold-digger’s charter.’ In his judgment, Mr Justice Holman said Mr Limata, 45, must receive £1.24million, including £900,000 to buy a new home. However, Miss Luckwell will own around half of the value of the home he buys until their youngest child, now two, is 22. Miss Luckwell was given her Connaught Square home, where Tony Blair is a neighbour, by her father in 2008. As this is her only asset, it was the only one the judge could consider. Mr Limata admitted he signed a pre-nuptial agreement and two supplementary contracts promising never to seek his wife’s money. Ms Luckwell's father Mike (pictured)  was also present to hear the judgement. Mr Limata claims the man has 'acted in spite' throughout proceedings, threatening to cut off his daughter so he doesn't get a pay out . But after the marriage broke down in November 2012, he was left penniless and homeless, ‘living like a tramp out of bin bags,’ he said. He is now earning the minimum wage at his mother’s bed and breakfast in Notting Hill. He claimed his father-in-law was motivated by spite and malice in vowing to cut off his daughter: ‘He has a determination to control almost every aspect of her life.’ Mr Luckwell said after the judgment: ‘A law which rewards a gold digger after signing three legal agreements merits real criticism.’ Mr Luckwell was ranked 17th in the Sunday Times Rich list. His production company created Bob the Builder (pictured) A statement for Mr Limata said he had ‘never sought a share of his wife’s wealth’ but instead sought ‘sufficient funds to meet his real financial needs having made financial contributions himself during the marriage from employment and his own inheritance’. It added: ‘Marriage brings with it important legal and moral obligations to care for the other spouse in a time of need, including if a marriage breaks down. Whilst those obligations can be properly regulated and defined by a pre-nuptial agreement, it cannot be right for it to remove entirely the obligation to provide for real need.’ Miss Luckwell married Mr Limata – ex-husband of underwear model and actress Katie Carr and a former boyfriend of Stella McCartney – in Mayfair in July 2005. They met while he was working as a film editor at The Moving Picture Company, the firm her father founded. The court heard they enjoyed a lavish lifestyle involving recreational cocaine use, extravagant holidays, live-in nannies and visits to Mr Luckwell’s Surrey mansion before they split following bitter rows. Miss Luckwell said Mr Limata had a ‘reluctance to work’ and had frittered money on designer clothes, art and strip clubs. She accused him of making ‘cruel and wholly unjustified criticisms against my family’. She added: ‘Frankie contributed nothing to my marriage in terms of capital. My father’s stated position that it would be outrageous if the court ordered Frankie anything is entirely understandable.’ Mr Justice Holman had urged the warring parties to find a way to reach an agreement, saying: ‘Between them they have spent £600,000 on this case. It is a great tragedy it has come this far. ‘Many hurtful things have been said. Caught in the cross fire are three adored, innocent but vulnerable children.’ He said that as Miss Luckwell ‘has never had a penny that has not come from her parents’, the only asset he could consider is the house gifted to her. He said that one of the reasons for his decision to award Mr Limata a settlement in the ‘exceptionally bitter’ and ‘very painful’ case was the children as ‘their overall welfare is better safeguarded and promoted by making some award to their father’. Bob the Builder was first broadcast in the UK in 1988 on CBBC. There are 18 series and a total of 118 episodes. The show follows Bob - a building contractor - and his colleague Wendy along with other friends and neighbours who, in each episode help with renovations, repairs and builds in their town. In the UK version of the show, Bob is voiced by Neil Morrissey. The show has been a huge international hit - and is broadcast in 30 countries. It is available in several languages also including English, Spanish,Dutch, Hebrew and Hindi. As well as the show being broadcast to a huge audience, there have been several spins offs - including Project Build It and Ready, Steady, Build! both of which follow Bob and his colleagues take part in a variety of new building projects. Numerous video games have also been created under the Bob the Builder umbrella - as have a number of models, dolls and lego figures. The theme tune for the show was famously released as a single in 2001 - reaching number 1 in the UK charts. Two more singles were then released - Mambo no.5, which also reached number 1, and Big Fish Little Fish, which only made it to number 81 in the UK charts.","Victoria Luckwell, 37, shared £6.6m home with Frankie Limata .

"MK Dons manager Karl Robinson insists he is going nowhere after confirming interest in his services from Sky Bet Championship side Birmingham. The League One Dons are loathe to lose Robinson and rejected an approach from Blues to speak to him about replacing Lee Clark, who left the Midlands club on Monday. Speaking after his side's 2-1 win at Fleetwood, which lifted the Dons up to fourth in the standings, Robinson confirmed he knew of the interest but was unwilling to go into details. Birmingham's attempts to land MK Dons boss Karl Robinson as their new manager were blocked by the club . He said: 'I believe there's been an approach but it's not something for me to get involved in. 'One thing I can say is that it's come as a shock and I think everyone has conducted themselves wonderfully well. 'I don't know how it's got out but it's something that has got into the public domain, although my agent found out about it by reading it. 'It's happened and the chairman said 'no' and we move on. I'm flattered by their approach but I'm just as flattered by the chairman's response.' Robinson said he was flattered by the interest but is fully committed to MK Dons, who are fourth in League One . Lee Clark was dismissed from the Birmingham hotseat on Monday after a poor start to the season . Clark had been manager since June 2012 but had won just once at home in the league in a year and the club acted, with the former Huddersfield boss under pressure from fans.

Speaking before Tuesday night’s 4-3 win at Carlisle, Rowett said: ‘First and foremost, it’s a compliment to everyone at the club that we’re doing things, for the third season in a row, quite well. A little bit of success is always going to bring speculation.’ Lee Clark was sacked by Birmingham after a poor run of results in the Championship this season . Other candidates for the role include Mike Phelan, Billy McKinlay and Owen Coyle. None of those would require compensation and it is understood Rowett also has a release clause. MK Dons manager Karl Robinson was approached by Birmingham, while Swindon Town manager Mark Cooper, like Rowett a former City player, and son of former St Andrew’s boss Terry Cooper, is another to have been linked with the post. Karl Robinson is understood to have been approached by Birmingham, impressing with his work at MK Dons .","Lee Clark was sacked by Birmingham last week after a bad run of results .

"American Patrick Reed has been cast in the role of bad guy at the Volvo World Match Play Championship at the London Club, and how he is relishing it. Up against Europe’s latest Ryder Cup darling Jamie Donaldson on Friday, he turned up for the part dressed appropriately in black trousers and black sweater. Outside the ropes, his equally extrovert wife Justine chose an outfit laden with stars and stripes. At the eighth hole, the crowd got into the mood by ‘shushing’ Reed on to the green in a mischievous mocking of the player’s infamous gesture at Gleneagles. Reed loved it. He couldn’t keep the smile off his face. Patrick Reed is thriving in the role as bad guy at the Volvo World Match Play Championship at the London Club . Reed (right) shakes hands with Jamie Donaldson (left) after winning his match on Friday . The 24-year-old (left) congratulated Donaldson (right) on Friday for claiming the winning Ryder Cup point . ‘I just wish I’d been able to hole the putt and have a bit of fun back with them,’ he said, smiling. If truth be told, of course, he’s not the bad guy at all but a refreshing presence in a sport where characters are always welcome. The British crowds have developed a soft spot for him already and, as we learned three weeks ago in Scotland, he can really play. Reed was firmly in control of this match until the end, when Donaldson threw an eagle at him at the 15th and then knocked a wonderful tee shot close to the flag at the par-three 16th. How would Reed respond? He calmly knocked his own tee shot to eight feet and holed the putt to close out the match. ‘TaxSlayer,’ is the logo on his sweater. By Sunday night he might have to change it to Euro-Slayer. Reed made headlines earlier this year when he brashly forecast it wouldn’t be long before he was ranked among the world’s top five. Reed enjoyed interacting with the crowd on Friday as he did during the Ryder Cup (pictured) Donaldson fought back against the American with an eagle at the fifteenth but it was not enough . Talk about piling the pressure on yourself, yet the following week he hung on to win the WGC-Cadillac Championship in Miami. It was his third win on the PGA Tour at the age of just 23 and now he has set his sights firmly on an overseas victory as the next step in his career. The first thing Reed did Friday was congratulate Donaldson on claiming the winning point at the Ryder Cup. ‘I saw him at Gleneagles but only briefly amidst everything that was going on and so it was nice to get the chance to say well done properly,’ said the Texan. ‘We talked about it quite a bit, and let’s hope we are both on future Ryder Cup teams.’ Provided they win their quarter-final ties today, Reed will play Henrik Stenson in the semis tomorrow morning in a repeat of their Ryder Cup singles match. Asked about that, Reed came up with the perfect response. ‘He’ll definitely be wanting to get back at me for that but I’ll be feeling a bit that way as well,’ he said. ‘After all, I might have got the W (a win) but he got to hold the trophy.’ Reed (right) takes on George Coetzee (left) on Saturday after the South African beat Thongchai Jaidee . Before that, Reed will take on South African George Coetzee on Saturday while the impressive Stenson, who closed out his match against Thongchai Jaidee by holing his second shot to the par-four 17th, will play fellow Swede Jonas Blixt. It is perhaps as well Stenson and Reed are still involved, for not one of the five players representing Britain and Ireland made it out of the group stages. Englishman Paul Casey was the unluckiest. He was actually 10 under par for his 18 holes yesterday but still couldn’t beat Blixt, who matched him to force a play-off for a quarter-final spot. Given the tremendous quality of the match, it was a shame that it had to end with a Casey blunder, as he found the water at the par five first to lose the hole to a par. Defending champion Graeme McDowell, Shane Lowry, and Stephen Gallacher were the other casualties. The other quarter-finals on Saturday, therefore, are all-European affairs: Joost Luiten against Pablo Larrazabal while Victor Dubuisson will play Mikko Ilonen.","Patrick Reed beat Welshman Jamie Donaldson on Friday .

"Exiled former master spy and traitor George Blake, whose betrayal of British agents to the KGB is said to have cost many lives, claims the ‘happiest years’ of his life are being spent in Putin-controlled Russia. In a rare interview marking his 90th birthday, the former MI6 officer recalled sharing cocktails, including martinis - favoured by James Bond - with fellow spies outside Moscow in their KGB retirement. Nearly five decades after he escaped from a British jail and was smuggled to East Berlin in a camper van in one of the classic cloak-and-dagger stories of the 20th century, Blake lives quietly in the Moscow suburbs with his wife Ida on a pension from the KGB. George Blake, a former British spy and double agent in service of the Soviet Union, seen in Moscow in 2006 says he is the happiest he's ever been . Betrayal: George Blake (right) with 'Cambridge spy' Kim Philby, who died 1988, pictured in Moscow in 1975 . ‘These are the happiest years of my life, and the most peaceful,’ Blake, who goes by the Russian name Georgy Ivanovich, said in the interview, published in the Russian government newspaper Rossiskaya Gazeta . ‘When I worked in the West, I always had the risk of exposure hanging over me. That is how it was. Here I feel free,’ said Blake, who will be joined in his birthday celebrations by three sons travelling from the UK and nine grandchildren. There was no sign of regret or remorse for his duplicity and he appeared content with the life he forged after being exposed with fellow traitors Donald Maclean and Kim Philby as among the most ‘significant’ spies of the Cold War years. A balding man with a grey beard, cradled his pet dog on his lap, as he said : ‘Looking back on my life, everything seems logical and natural. ‘I have known how to adapt well wherever life has taken me, even when I was in the (Wormwood) Scrubs prison. I always try to find something positive ... I inherited it from my mother. She was always very positive, optimistic, always in a good mood.’ That escape in October 1966 together with two anti-nuclear protestors caused a sensation and despite a massive manhunt, he was able to be smuggled back to Russia. Spy games: East German guards watching over the Berlin wall . The spy recalled sipping martinis with other double agents and described how he lives a quiet life in the Moscow suburbs . Blake worked for the British Secret Intelligence Service, MI6, from the 1940s. He became a committed communist while a North Korean prisoner during the Korean war, and worked for Moscow after being posted by MI6 to Berlin in 1955. Over nine years working for the KGB, he is believed to have betrayed the names of more than 40 British agents to the Soviets. Many disappeared, and were thought to have been executed - he insists none died as a result of his betrayal. His actions devastated British secret service operations in the Middle East. He is believed to have passed on the names of almost every British agent working in Cairo, Damascus and Beirut. After he was exposed in 1961 by a Polish defector as a Soviet spy, he was sentenced to 42 years jail. But he broke out of prison five years later with the help of other inmates. He hurt his arm during the escape jumping from the wall of the West London top security jail, and was smuggled out to East Berlin in the secret compartment of a camper van. ‘Look, you can still see the traces (of the fracture),’ Blake told Rossiyskaya Gazeta, holding up his arm. Blake, who was awarded a medal by President Valdimir Putin in 2007, said nothing about contemporary politics in Russia. Like Putin, who also served as a KGB spy in East Berlin, Blake holds the rank of lieutenant colonel in the ex-Soviet agency. Fugitive: After his escape from prison in the UK, Blake was smuggled back to East Berlin . The traitor described how he has always been able to adapt to any environment, including Wormwood Scrubs prison, pictured, where he was briefly imprisoned . Blake’s case was among the most notorious of the Cold War, alongside those of a separate ring of British double agents known as the Cambridge Five. Blake knew two of the five, Maclean and Philby, during his retirement. At one point in the interview, he reminisced about drinking with his mother and Philby. He said he was closer in spirit to Maclean, the member of the group known to have adjusted best to life in Russia. Maclean died in Russia in 1983, and Philby in 1988, leaving Blake the most famous Cold War turncoat to outlive the Soviet Union. Of the rest of the Cambridge five, Guy Burgess died in Russia in 1963, while art historian Anthony Blunt confessed in secret, received immunity from prosecution and was exposed only decades later, to die in disgrace in London in 1983. The identity of the ring’s ‘fifth man’ has never been confirmed - but recent claims emerged saying it was Andrew Gow, who tutored George Orwell at Eton. Adviser: Anthony Blunt, with the Queen during her visit to the Courtauld Institute of Art where he was a director, has a member of the Cambridge Five . Asked about how he had passed on information to Soviet contacts while in Berlin, Blake said he travelled to the Soviet controlled sector of Berlin on a rail link joining different parts of the divided city. ‘I met a Soviet comrade about once a month,’ he said, explaining that his contact would be waiting for him in a car and they would go to a safe house. ‘I handed over films and we chatted. Sometimes we had a glass of Tsimlyansk champagne (Soviet sparkling wine).’ Blake said his three British sons would travel over to Russia for his birthday. He also has a son who was born and lives in Russia. In 1990, he published his autobiography, No Other Choice, for which he received about £60,000 from the book’s British publisher before the government stepped in to freeze the remaining £90,000 he had been promised. Thirteen years later, he accused the British government of breaching his human rights by confiscating the money. He was awarded £5,000 compensation in September 2006.","Double agent exposed the identities of hundreds of Western agents - some of whom were executed because of his treason .

"Paul Ogata says he was racially mocked by a Qantas attendant on a flight from LA to Sydney . Japanese-American comedian Paul Ogata claims a Qantas flight attendant humiliated him about his race on a flight from LA to Australia where he is currently touring. Ogata said the male steward acted shocked when the comedian ordered the beef from the menu and loudly replied with 'You don't want the Asian chicken? What a disgrace!' Then to make matters worse, Ogata said laughter erupted from 'White Australian' passengers sitting near him on the 13-hour-flight. The Hawaii born 45-year-old was so outraged by the remark that he took to his blog to vent his disbelief about the humiliating experience labelling the 'tale of the Q Qlux Qlan' He posted that he calmly decided to sit in quiet rage despite being offended by the remark. 'I glared at him and he moved on. Could I have started an altercation then and there?' 'Yes. But I don't like to sit in restraints in the lavatory under guard by an Air Marshall for thirteen hours. So instead, like Oran Juice Jones, I chilled,' he said. 'Ah, I see. So in addition to the fact that he's a racist a**, he operates under the greater paradigm of racism that is his employer, Qantas. The menu says 'Asian style spicy chicken,' but the other option is simply, 'Red wine braised beef.' A photo of the flight attendant that allegedly offended Ogata which the comedian posted on his blog . Ogata is currently touring in Australia . Ogata went on to question the general use of the word - Asian. 'But why isn't it 'White people style beef'? Plus, what kind of Asian do they mean? Russians? Israeli? Laotian?' 'If we are to understand Qantas correctly, the 4.4 billion people in 44 different Asian countries all cook chicken the same spicy non-white way. If it is based on a Chinese recipe, then why not just say so.' But his rant didn't stop there as his incredulousness about the situation continued. 'Most likely, the mouth-breather in charge of 'customer service' on my flight will get a special commendation from corporate,' he said. 'After all, he went out of his way not to humiliate the white passengers for not ordering the 'white people style beef.' 'For an airline that lost over $200 million in the first half of this year alone, you’d think they would try a little harder to please.' The Asian chicken dish on the flight menu which allegedly kicked off the whole incident . Qantas stated that no complaint was made to the two senior cabin crew managers on board the flight at the time, so the company was unaware of the issue until it was raised with the airline on social media. The airline company is going through the process of talking to the other flight attendants on board to understand their perspective on events, as well as what steps might be taken to ensure it does not happen again. 'Qantas does not tolerate discrimination in any form and we take such reports very seriously. We are investigating this issue further internally,' a Qantas spokesman said. 'As a hugely diverse, multicultural business with employees of around 100 different nationalities, suggestions of racism are extremely disturbing to us. We consider racism deplorable and unacceptable wherever it occurs.'","Comedian Paul Ogata claims a Qantas steward racially mocked him .

"Former England batsman Kevin Pietersen has not ruled out playing county cricket again next season. Pietersen who has been contracted to Surrey since 2010, although he only played in the T20 Blast competition last summer. The South African-born batsman said he would make a decision about his playing future over the next couple of months but insisted he had been in contact with Surrey, where his mentor Graham Ford is head coach. VIDEO: Scroll down to see Kevin Pietersen speak about bullying in the England camp . Kevin Pietersen in action for Surrey during the Natwest T20 Blast semi-final against Birmingham Bears . 'I am definitely going to give it some thought over the next couple of months as to how I need to finish off my career because I look at the situation and think they are not going to pick me for the Ashes next year,' Pietersen said. 'I don't want to make quick decisions and I want to give it some time, give it some thought. 'I am in contact with Surrey because I love Surrey and Graham Ford, my mentor, is the coach there. I get on so well with Alec Stewart and the lads in the dressing room there. 'So if I decide that I want to continue playing and basically play for the next four or five years then, yes, it is something I am basically going to make happen in the next couple of months.' Former England head coach Andy Flower (right) was singled out for criticism in Pietersen's book . Since arriving in the UK from South Africa as a teenager, Pietersen has played county cricket for Nottinghamshire, Hampshire and now Surrey and amassed 104 Test appearances for England. Pietersen was speaking during a Q&A event at the Cheltenham Literature Festival with Sunday Times journalist David Walsh, who ghost wrote his controversial autobiography published last week. In the book Pietersen made several allegations, including claims of a bullying culture in the England dressing room. Former head coach Andy Flower and wicketkeeper Matt Prior were particuarly singled out for criticism. Following England's disastrous 5-0 whitewashing in the Ashes last winter in Australia, Flower stood down and Pietersen was told his Test career was over. Pietersen insisted that he would love to bat for England again and 'would do anything to go and play'. Andrew Strauss (right) fears Pietersen's book will hurt England in the long run . 'I would 100% commit everything I could to bat. I would do anything to go and play,' Pietersen said. 'The frustrating thing about this last summer is that England have now got a team where that bullying side looks like it has faded away and there are a lot of youngsters in that side that I got on really well with, who I helped out with their cricket. 'The sad thing is that I can be lying on the sofa the night before an international game and I can get a text message from players in the team asking me advice on how to play the opposition the next day. 'That makes me happy that they are asking me on how to play the next day when they should probably be going to their coach and also with sadness because I should still be in that team helping these guys bat and helping in team meetings and playing in games because that's where we could all benefit.' Pietersen also said that he would not have any problems playing under new head coach Peter Moores - who he likens in his book to a 'woodpecker tapping on our heads all day' during his first spell as England boss. Pietersen, in action for during the fourth Ashes Test in Melbourne last year, has spoken of his demons . 'When I did have my issues with Moores they were as a captain,' Pietersen told the Cheltenham audience. 'I said to the chairman of the ECB, I cannot captain with Moores, let me go back and bat. So I could easily go and bat, batting would not be an issue.' But he felt it was unlikely that he would ever be recalled by England while Giles Clarke remained chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB). 'I said it before that I think the chairman might have to make way,' Pietersen said. 'Whether that happens I don't know. If it happens, it happens and said earlier that what will be, will be. I live in hope. Who knows what tomorrow brings? 'They might wake up tomorrow and decide enough's enough and this PR battle that is going on at the moment is not good for English cricket, I am certainly not proud of this PR battle but I've had to tell my side of the story.' One member of the audience asked Pietersen why England were such a successful team in recent years if Andy Flower was such a bad coach. 'We had some very, very good players who were at the peak of their careers and no matter who coached them we would have been successful,' the South African replied. Pietersen agreed with the comments last week of former England captain Andrew Strauss, who said the biggest loser in the wake of the publication of his book was the England team. 'I do agree with that and I don't like it and as I said I am not proud of it but what I am incredibly proud of is having the opportunity and the ability to sit down with David over the last few months and get my side of the story out,' Pietersen said. 'I've had too many times where my character has been assassinated with Flower being able to drive it one way, hammer me about injuries, nail me about this, go over me about that, and so I have just had my opportunity to come out and put my side of the story out and just leave it. 'It's a sad state where English cricket is but it doesn't have to be there now, it should have been sorted with a decent coach.' For nearly an hour-and-a-half Pietersen spoke about some of the demons that affected his playing career, such as knowing when he walked out to the crease whether he would get a good score or not. 'In the recent Ashes series we played in Australia I walked out to the wicket at Adelaide and I got out for nine. I walked down the wicket and hit Peter Siddle straight to mid-wicket and George Bailey caught me,' he said. 'I knew how I had got out and I knew I was lucky to get nine. But I got crucified - selfish, reckless, careless, why did you play the shot, why did you do this. 'I'm a 'feel' player and I'll know as soon as I get out to the wicket and touch my bat on the ground I know whether I am going to have a good day or a bad day. 'It's just the most ridiculous thing - the hours I put into training. I can walk out to the wicket and I can stand there and go 'Oh shit' - or walk out and think 'good luck you lot'. 'There are certainly those days that I feel horrendous. 'It has probably been my biggest struggle and I remember working a lot with the psychologists. If I walk out there and I am not feeling good how can I still get to 10? 'Because getting to 10 for me was everything because as soon as I got to double figures I knew I was home and away. Until I got there I knew it was only me who would get myself out. 'Good coaches and captains would understand, Duncan Fletcher and Michael Vaughan did. 'That day in Adelaide when I hit Siddle to mid-wicket why the hell was I trying to do that? It just doesn't make sense.' Pietersen said he was already planning for future after his career ends. 'I have been quite clever when I have been playing to set up quite a few businesses. The most exciting thing I have going at the moment is my cricket school in Dubai, which opens next month,' he said. 'My foundation is going to run alongside that. I love coaching kids and I love giving advice, encouraging... I love seeing people do well. I love coaching and I love giving back and I've set up this cricket school purely for that. 'If I get one or two of those guys that come through my academy end up being international players it would make me so proud.'","Pietersen has been contracted to Surrey since 2010, but only played in the T20 Blast competition last summer .

"Neil Warnock has been charged with misconduct by the Football Association for his post-match comments in the media about the performance of referee Craig Pawson during Crystal Palace's defeat at home to Chelsea. Swansea manager Garry Monk has escaped a charge – at least for now – but has been ordered to explain his stinging verbal attack on referee Michael Oliver after his side lost at Stoke. Warnock has until 6pm on Monday to respond to his charge, which revolves around claims that Pawson had not refereed from an 'even platform', allowing John Terry to escape a yellow card and then booking Damien Delaney for a similar offence.

"Tony Pulis has spoken in depth for the first time about his time as Crystal Palace manager and his dramatic departure from the club. Speaking to the BBC’s Football Focus in an interview to be aired on Saturday, Pulis says he risked his reputation by taking the job last November and revealed that Sir Alex Ferguson was one of few people who told him to do so. Pulis won Barclays Premier League manager of the year in May after guiding Palace to an 11th-placed finish but left the club before the start of the season. Tony Pulis says he feels he risked his career by taking the Crystal Palace manager's job last season . Pulis eventually fell out with chairman Steve Parish (right) and left the club two days before the season's start . The former Stoke manager’s relationship with co-chairman Steve Parish quickly disintegrated and Pulis departed by ‘mutual consent’ just two days before the start of the season. Referring to the time when Parish convinced Pulis to succeed Ian Holloway at Selhurst Park with Palace languishing in the bottom three, Pulis said: ‘Steve Parish was very persistent, I think he spoke to me on three occasions. ‘I spoke to a lot of people and a lot of people said “no, it wouldn’t be a club to go in to”, for all sorts of reasons. ‘I spoke to Sir Alex (Ferguson), I spoke to Peter (Stoke chairman Coates), those two were the people who said it could be done, it wasn’t an impossible job. They mentioned about the crowd, about the supporters being 110 per cent behind the team. Pulis admits he likes 'a challenge' and getting Palace out of the relegation zone was certainly a challenge . Steve Parish visited Pulis and contacted him three times as he was keen for him to take the job . Sir Alex Ferguson was one of only a few people who told the former Stoke boss that the move was a good idea . ‘Steve came down to Bournemouth and we actually sat down in the house and that was the first time I thought: “I’m going to do this. I’m going to take the challenge”. ‘Obviously you put your own reputation on the line. Everybody knows I’ve never been relegated. ‘They were in a dreadful position at the time. But it was a challenge and, as you know, I do like challenges.’ Neil Warnock took on Pulis' old job as Palace manager - his second spell in the top job at Selhurst Park .","Former Crystal Palace boss  says he took some convincing to take the job .

"It is a sweltering summer afternoon on Tyneside. A player once billed as the successor to Cristiano Ronaldo at Manchester United trains with his fellow outcasts, while their team-mates and manager are 12,000 miles away in New Zealand. Afterwards, he drives to the suburb of Gosforth - birthplace of Alan Shearer - and takes a seat in the window of Adriano’s Deli. He orders a coffee and reads newspapers from across the Continent, where he will learn that Ligue 1 Evian are interested in signing him. No-one bothers him, no-one bangs on the glass asking for an autograph or selfie. No-one, including the club by whom he is employed, cares much for what he does. Gabriel Obertan has turned his Newcastle career around after it appeared dead in the water this summer . Obertan (front) was told he could find a new club during the summer by boss Alan Pardew . Newcastle United’s Gabriel Obertan is the forgotten man. Like Hatem Ben Arfa, his former comrade at France’s prestigious Clairefontaine academy, he has been told to find a new club. Ben Arfa subsequently goes to Hull City on loan but Obertan remains, returning to Adriano’s most days as reward for his efforts in training, often with no senior staff watching. Three months on, however, and Newcastle boss Alan Pardew is very much aware of Obertan. Without him, four points from matches against Leicester and Swansea would have been just one. He, and four-goal Papiss Cisse, have saved their manager. The 25-year-old (right) has since knuckled down and scored their winner in Saturday's 1-0 victory vs Leicester . On Saturday Obertan scored in a 1-0 win over Leicester. It was his first home start in two seasons and first Premier League goal in 32 months. ‘When you spend three or four months without playing then you start doubting. You sometimes let yourself go a little bit,’ admits the 25-year-old winger, who arrived in England in 2009 when signed by Manchester United. ‘This time was different, I just kept going. If people think that you’re done, that’s their problem. As long as you remember what you have done in the past and believe in yourself then it will go your way at some point.’ Hatem Ben Arfa (right) joined Hull on loan after being told he was surplus to requirements at Newcastle . Go his way it has. Obertan has spent a week accepting praise and thanks from team-mates and staff at the same training ground which, during the summer, proved such a lonely place. Popular and intelligent — ‘he speaks better English than all of us,’ said one source — he has not spoken about his exile. ‘It was difficult, you don’t know how to handle the situation,’ he told BBC Radio Newcastle. ‘You get impatient and frustrated (but) you can’t always blame someone else. You have to look at yourself and work through these difficulties. It will pay off. ‘These lows build your character. It gets to you and you feel left out but then you think about the situation... it could be worse. ‘I’m still in a great club, working hard and trying to make a name for myself. I am turning things around. I hope it is a resurrection of my career here.’ Obertan (left) joined Manchester United in a £3million deal from French outfit Bordeaux in 2009 . It was Sir Alex Ferguson who paid Bordeaux £3million for Obertan in 2009, the same summer he sold Ronaldo to Real Madrid for £80m. Both right wingers, there was an inevitable and unfair comparison, something Obertan despised. Ferguson, in his autobiography, wrote: ‘He was greased lightning. But in the final third his feet were sometimes all over the place. His task was to co-ordinate his feet with his brain and deliver the hurt in the final third.’ At Old Trafford, he never did. Likewise, in his first three seasons at St James’ Park, feet and brain were often at odds. Not any more. Obertan (left) failed to live up to expectation at Old Trafford and was sold to Newcastle . Three months ago, he asked himself how badly he wanted it. ‘That’s what it’s about,’ he says. ‘It’s easy to work when people see you, it’s another thing to work when they don’t. You have to wake up and still do it. No coaches are there to pat you on the back.’ This week, there have been plenty of pats on the back. He might even have to forgo his favourite seat at the coffee shop.","Gabriel Obertan scored Newcastle's winner against Leicester on Saturday .

Key match stats (supplied by Opta) Sunderland have scored 15 own goals since the start of the 2010-11 season, more than any other Barclays Premier League side. Arsenal are looking to win four Premier League away games in a row against Sunderland for the first time. The Black Cats have won just one of their last 21 Premier League games against Arsenal. Arsenal need two more goals to become the second team (after Man Utd) to score 1500 Premier League goals. Sunderland's Phil Bardsley makes a sliding tackle on Arsenal's Aaron Ramsey during the Black Cats' last Premier League victory over Arsene Wenger's team with a 1-0 at the Stadium of Light in November 2009 . Arsenal’s two league wins this season have come via a 90th minute winner against Crystal Palace in their opening game and 3-0 win at struggling Aston Villa. Only two Premier League teams have kept a clean sheet after conceding 8-plus goals in the preceding match (Arsenal in 2011 after losing 8-2 to Man Utd and Wigan in 2009 after losing 9-1 to Spurs). Despite conceding eight to Southampton last time out, Sunderland (2) have kept twice as many Premier League clean sheets as Arsenal this season. If Arsenal fail to win it will be their worst performance after nine games in the Arsene Wenger era (previously 13 in 2011-12). If Arsenal lose they will have half the number of points they had at this stage last season. Lee Cattermole has been booked in two of his last three Premier League appearances.

Misfiring striker Mario Balotelli is likely to keep his place for the visit of Hull as manager Brendan Rodgers has limited options up front. The 24-year-old has scored just once in 10 appearances but with Daniel Sturridge still sidelined by a calf problem the Italy international will probably start ahead of Rickie Lambert.

Injuries have hit Hull hard in the past week, meaning big changes for the trip to Liverpool on Saturday. Third-choice goalkeeper Eldin Jakupovic is in line for only his second Barclays Premier League start with Allan McGregor (shoulder) and Steve Harper (bicep) both out, while striker Nikica Jelavic (knee) and centre-back Michael Dawson (ankle) are both missing for at least a month. Left-back Andy Robertson has a knock that is set to keep him out too, but Tom Huddlestone should be fine to play through discomfort for the third game in a row.

The Tigers have only won one of their 18 meetings with the Reds in all competitions (D4 L13), with that win coming on home soil last season. Neither of Liverpool’s scorers in this fixture last season (Agger, Suarez) remain at the club. Steven Gerrard has three goals in two starts against Hull at Anfield. Hull (along with Chelsea and Everton) are one of only three teams to score in every Premier League game this season. Mario Balotelli has put more clear cut chances off target than any other Premier League player this season (3). After winning 11 Premier League games in a row between February and April, Liverpool have won just five of the subsequent 11 matches. The Reds have kept just one clean sheet in their last 14 Premier League matches. Liverpool have conceded exactly one goal in each of their last five Premier League games at Anfield. Hull’s last two away games have ended 2-2. Only two teams in Premier League history have recorded three successive 2-2s away from home (Man Utd in 1994 and Newcastle in 2003).

Newcastle United striker Papiss Cisse is a doubt for the Magpies' trip to White Hart Lane on Sunday . Newcastle . Newcastle boss Alan Pardew is keeping his fingers crossed over a series of injury doubts as he prepares to name his team to face Tottenham on Sunday. In-form striker Papiss Cisse is a doubt with a knee problem, while fellow forward Emmanuel Riviere, who missed last weekend's 1-0 Barclays Premier League win over Leicester with an unspecified knock, is in a similar situation. So too are defenders Mike Williamson (muscle problem), Paul Dummett (hamstring) and midfielders Cheick Tiote (calf) and Sammy Ameobi (knock). Utility man Ryan Taylor returns to the squad for the first time in 26 months after two cruciate ligament injuries and Rolando Aarons (hamstring) is also on the mend, but fellow midfielder Siem de Jong is unlikely to return until January as he continues to battle his way back from a torn thigh muscle.

Key match stats (supplied by Opta) Tottenham have scored at least once in 18 of their last 19 Premier League games against Newcastle. None of the last 17 league meetings between these sides at White Hart Lane has ended as a draw. After winning four successive Premier League games in London between May 2013 and January 2014, Newcastle have lost their last three in a row, failing to score in each match. Christian Eriksen has scored in his last two Premier League appearances but it yet to assist a goal in the top-flight this season (last year he provided eight assists). Newcastle goalkeeper Tim Krul (floor) put in an inspired performance to help Newcastle win 1-0, thanks to a first-half Loic Remy strike, on their last visit to Tottenham . Roberto Soldado has assisted as many Premier League goals as he has scored (6). Tottenham have conceded nine Premier League penalties in 2014, more than any other team. Papiss Cisse has scored four goals and assisted one more in four Premier League appearances in 2014-15. Six of Tottenham’s 10 goals this season have come before half-time, while Newcastle have the highest proportion of second half goals in the division in 2014-15 (75 per cent; 6 of 8). The average length of Newcastle’s goals this season has been 9.02 yards, the shortest distance of any of the 20 teams in the division.

"Patrick Reed gained a small measure of revenge for last month's Ryder Cup defeat by knocking European hero Jamie Donaldson out of the Volvo World Match Play Championship on Friday. And another key member of the victory at Gleneagles also fell by the wayside at The London Club as defending champion Graeme McDowell suffered his second successive defeat. McDowell lost by two holes to Holland's Joost Luiten to miss out on the knockout stages for the first time in four appearances in the event, the Northern Irishman having reached the quarter-finals in 2011, the final in 2012 and winning last year in Bulgaria. Jamie Donaldson was brought back down to earth with a bump by Patrick Reed after his Ryder Cup heroics . US Ryder Cup star Reed enjoyed his day at the London Club on Friday afternoon . 11.40am: Reed vs Coetzee . 11.55: Dubuisson vs Ilonen . 12.10: Luiten vs Larrazabal . 12.25: Stenson vs Blixt . Scotland's Stephen Gallacher had already been eliminated after losing his first two matches, leaving Victor Dubuisson and Henrik Stenson to fly the flag for the victorious European team this weekend. Stenson and Reed will enjoy a re-match of their Ryder Cup singles clash in the semi-finals if they can see off Jonas Blixt and George Coetzee respectively in the last eight, with Dubuisson taking on Mikko Ilonen and Luiten facing Pablo Larrazabal in the other quarter-finals. 'Henrik will have revenge on his mind but I will too,' said Reed, who beat Stenson on the 18th at Gleneagles to finish as the top US points scorer on his debut. 'I might have the 'W' in the singles but he has the cup and I don't.' Donaldson, who secured the winning point against Keegan Bradley to make it three wins from four matches on his debut was never ahead against Reed, who carded six birdies but was also crucially gifted the 11th when Donaldson three-putted from close range. Birdies on the 12th and 14th took Reed four ahead with four to play and although Donaldson kept the match alive by almost holing his second shot to the par-five 15th and hitting his tee shot to two feet on the next, Reed also made birdie on the 16th to seal the win. Reed hit the headlines at the Ryder Cup for signalling to the European fans to keep quiet when he made crucial putts, but admitted he expected more banter with the crowds this week. Victor Dubuisson plays his shot from the fairway on the 15th hole during day three of the World Match Play . Jonas Blixt of Sweden hits a shot on the first hole of his play-off against Paul Casey at the London Club . Joost Luiten chips out of the rough on the 13th during his match against Graeme McDowell . Dubuisson and Stephen Gallacher on the eighth green at the Volvo World Matchplay . 'I had a couple of shushes on eight the par three,' he said. 'If I had made the putt I would have turned round to do it back and try to get them going but unfortunately I missed it! 'I thought I would have heard more because it was the first time I was playing a guy on the Ryder Cup team since the Ryder Cup but the fans loved the golf we were playing.' The best golf of the day came in the match between Blixt and England's Paul Casey, who both finished 10 under par and went into a sudden-death play-off to decide who finished second to Reed in their group. A par at the first extra hole was enough for Blixt to advance after Casey's approach found water guarding the green. McDowell was 'only' three under in losing to Luiten, who birdied three of the last four holes to become the only player to win all three of his group matches. Ryder Cup star Henrik Stenson sealed his progress into a quarter-final against fellow Swede Blixt . Graeme McDowell plays from deep rough into the 18th green during his defeat by Joost Luiten . 'A bit like yesterday, I ran into a guy on form,' said McDowell, who was three up after eight holes. 'I thought I had the match in control but the putter abandoned me at the 11th hour. I just kind of used my putts up against Alex (Levy) on Wednesday. 'I'm very disappointed by my defence of the title but there was a lot of quality golf out there. If you're not shooting 64 or 65 you're going home. But I hit the ball beautifully with a new set of irons and a new ball in the bag this week and I can't wait to get to China now. I'm in the mood to get on a plane now to China, so bring it on.' Stenson made sure of his place in the quarter-finals in style by holing his second shot to the 17th to beat 2013 runner-up Thongchai Jaidee 2&1, while Coetzee advanced despite losing by the same score to the already-eliminated Francesco Molinari. After 10 straight singles defeats Gallacher defeated Dubuisson 2&1 in their dead rubber, while Larrazabal - who chipped in on the 18th to beat Gallacher on Thursday - defeated Ireland's Shane Lowry by the same score. 'I feel I just need to work a wee bit on my game,' Gallacher said. 'I'm not far away. I came here working on something anyway and I'll just keep chipping away and see what happens for the last four or five tournaments of the year.'","Patrick Reed beat Jamie Donaldson to reach World Match Play quarter-finals .

"Gus Poyet says he could have been sacked in any other country following the humiliation of an 8-0 defeat. Sunderland face Arsenal at the Stadium of Light on Saturday with Poyet still in charge despite equalling a club-record loss at Southampton last weekend. And the Uruguayan said: ‘In another country, maybe an 8-0 defeat means that you lose your job. In England, that is not the case – at the moment. Sunderland boss Gus Poyet was embarrassed by his side's 8-0 defeat against Southampton . Poyet watched his Sunderland players trudge off the St Mary's turf after their heavy loss . ‘I’ve seen it in the past. I have seen other teams lose 8-0 and nothing happens, and the manager is still managing and the players are still playing. Everybody moves on, which is fine. But I can tell you, that it is only here.’ On Tuesday, Poyet and his players gathered in the auditorium-style meeting room at the club’s training ground and reluctantly worked through the horror of their capitulation at St Mary’s. Some of those culpable tried to offer explanation for their actions, but still the manager could not comprehend the ‘embarrassment’ which had unfolded before him. On Saturday night, having flown back to the North-East amid a muted atmosphere, he remained at home, refusing even to venture out to a restaurant. The following day he again chose to remain indoors – he did not want to see his players – painstakingly poring over the calamitous clips needed for the team meeting. The players, it is said, have been quiet this week and no-one will speak to the press before the game. Such was the margin and manner of defeat, only a reaction against Arsenal can right their wrongs. For now, words can wait. There was, however, a gesture from the squad to supporters amounting to around £60,000 in refunds for their match tickets, but most fans have indicated that they will instead allow the money to go to charity. Sunderland goalkeeper Vito Mannone sunk to the floor after conceding against Southampton . Ronald Koeman, pictured looking over to Poyet, masterminded an 8-0 win over the Black Cats . Rather, it is a performance they want on Saturday afternoon. Poyet, though, preferred not to talk of reactions and cut a confused and disturbed figure when he spoke to the press on Thursday, perhaps that was the lingering effect of shock. ‘I was unpleasantly surprised,’ he said. ‘Why? Because I swear I didn’t expect that to happen to me. The way that we were, the way that we defended, the way the players were on the pitch, the type of group that we want the players to be – everything. ‘It was horrible. I stayed in all weekend. But I am on my own and am a bad cook, so I had to go out eventually.’ In the wake of the defeat Poyet suggested he was not responsible for the depth of his squad. ‘I have four defenders, I play four defenders’ he delivered cuttingly. The club have moved to address that shortfall by bringing in 34-year-old former France defender Anthony Reveillere and he could start against the Gunners. There will also be changes elsewhere with Poyet admitting he can ‘do what he likes’ with regards team selection and no-one could knock on his door to complain. Black Cats boss Poyet may choose to ring the changes for his side's upcoming match against Arsenal . Poyet has brought in France defender Anthony Reveillere in hope that the 34-year-old can bolster his defence . The 46-year-old saw a different side to several players at Southampton, although when asked if he had lost faith in any individuals, he said: ‘No... Not yet.’ The pause was telling. For no matter how hard he strived for optimism, Poyet was repeatedly drawn back to Southampton and the reason as to why his players surrendered in such sorry fashion. ‘I was lucky never to have been in that situation,’ he said. ‘But maybe it’s not luck, maybe I didn’t allow my team-mates to put me in that situation. ‘I think the most I conceded was six, against the dream team of Barcelona. I can tell you they could really play. I don’t want to think about what would have happened if we had been playing them on Saturday, it might have finished 25-0.’ Now 25-0 would have got Poyet the sack. As it is, 8-0 affords him a shot at redemption. Another heavy defeat, however, and local restaurant takings will be down for a second weekend running. It would certainly give the club’s owner food for thought.","Gus Poyet's side were beaten 8-0 by Southampton last weekend .

"Manchester City could be without midfielder Yaya Toure for Saturday’s Barclays Premier League clash with Tottenham. Toure has been away on international duty with the Ivory Coast and is not due back in training until Friday. That leaves manager Manuel Pellegrini with a big decision ahead of a crucial game and it may well be that the City boss decides to rest his star midfielder ahead of Tuesday’s Champions League visit to CSKA Moscow. Yaya Toure is a doubt for Manchester City's clash with Tottenham at the Etihad on Saturday . Toure, pictured in action for Ivory Coast against DR Congo, will return to training with City on Friday . Toure has endured an indifferent season so far and has certainly not played well in City’s two Champions League games, the defeat by Bayern Munich and the home draw with Roma. However he did score as Ivory Coast lost 4-3 to DR Congo in an Africa Cup of Nations qualifier earlier this week. Pellegrini has options if he wishes to leave Toure out, with former Chelsea midfielder Frank Lampard in particularly good form. Frank Lampard (second from right) is one of the midfield options available to Manuel Pellegrini . Lampard scored eight goals against Tottenham during his 13 years with Chelsea, and he hopes to continue that good record this weekend. He told Manchester City's official website: 'I’ve done alright against Spurs over the years and playing them was always a big game at Chelsea. 'Even when I was at West Ham, Tottenham were big rivals so I’ve always seen it is a big game and something to mark on the calendar and that doesn’t change now I’m at City.'","Yaya Toure could miss Premier League showdown with Spurs .

"It is 4am, the old centre back has not slept a wink. His mind is racing; training drills, team selection, travel plans. It is now 6am, still without any sleep but energised and excited, the young coach is up and ready for the day ahead, his first as a football manager. Sam Collins – the Hartlepool United defender, reserve-team coach and caretaker boss - is 37 years old. Sam Collins is in temporary charge at Hartlepool following the departure of Colin Cooper earlier this month . The club's form has picked up since Collins took control, and last week they beat Exeter City 2-1 away . Collins currently fulfills the roles of defender, reserve-team coach and caretaker manager at Hartlepool . He is both a veteran – 593 professional appearances – and a rookie, now 12 days and two games in to his temporary tenure. He is also one of just eight Englishmen under 40 currently taking charge of a League club. None of those won an international cap. Only two of them – Garry Monk and Shaun Derry – played in the Premier League, albeit a handful of times. So where are those trophy-laden England stars? Why aren’t they taking on the challenge at Victoria Park? Answer: they don’t need it. David Beckham, Gary Neville, Paul Scholes, Jamie Carragher – they don’t need Southend away on a wet Tuesday night, they don’t even need Southampton away on a sunny Saturday afternoon. Swansea boss Garry Monk is currently the youngest manager in the Premier League and will turn 36 in March . Notts County boss Shaun Derry is one of eight Englishmen under the age of 40 taking charge of a League club . The likes of David Beckham and Gary Neville don't need to travel to Southend on a cold and wet Tuesday night . Rather, the next generation of English coaches – an endangered species according to FA Commission reports – are guys like Collins. A father of four, he needs it. More importantly, he wants it. ‘If I’m asked to do this job, then I would love to,’ says the man who has scribbled a dossier on training sessions and tactics garnered from a 20-year playing career and geared towards this day. ‘I’ve always wanted to be a coach and a manager. I’ve said it since I was in my 20s. People used to think I was daft. But this is what I’ve always wanted to do. Yeah, my phone hasn’t stopped and I’ve hardly slept, but I’m loving every minute.’ Collins – who will complete his UEFA Pro Licence next summer - adds: ‘I think it is players like myself who are the English coaches of the future. ‘Look at Eddie Howe at Bournemouth, he’s the perfect example - players from the lower leagues with a lot of experience. So there is a place there for young coaches but you need that chance because I still think there are too many foreign managers and players in English football.’ QPR boss Harry Redknapp agrees that managers that work their way up are the future of British coaching . In his latest book, A Man Walks On To a Pitch, Redknapp says Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal could not have matched Steve Bruce's achievements at Hull in recent seasons . Harry Redknapp agrees with Collins. In his new book, A Man Walks On To a Pitch, he writes: ‘Louis van Gaal couldn’t have done a better job with Hull City than Steve Bruce did last year. Yet did his heroics in the League and FA Cup create even a ripple at Old Trafford? ‘OK, a few times in his career it hasn’t worked out but that would be true of Van Gaal, too, if he had spent his managerial life at clubs like Sheffield United, Huddersfield Town or Hull. I don’t understand why owners suddenly lost faith in British managers. ‘And where’s the next generation of English managers coming from? Will the current top tier of English players go through the leagues to prove themselves, as Bruce has done? Lads who have had 10 seasons at Chelsea in the Abramovich years won’t get out of bed for what the manager of Exeter City gets paid.’ Or, indeed, for what the manager of Hartlepool gets paid. They are now searching for their fifth boss in three years. Among the applications there will be those from abroad and former Hearts chief Csaba Laszlo is one of the frontrunners. Even Sven-Goran Eriksson expressed an interest two years ago. But perhaps their best bet already resides within the Vic. Former defender Colin Cooper quit Hartlepool following a 3-0 home defeat to Carlisle United in October . Hartlepool were without a win in five and bottom of the Football League when Colin Cooper quit earlier this month. There is dissatisfaction among fans. They have threatened to boycott the next home game in protest against Norwegian owners Increased Oil Recovery and a perceived lack of investment in the playing squad. None of that, however, will deter Collins – and many others – from putting forward their case to be installed on a permanent basis. The caretaker’s accent is on youth, evidenced by an XI which included five players 21 or under during Saturday’s 2-1 victory at Exeter City, a result which lifted the gloom and elevated their league standing by three places. They entertain Luton this weekend, but not before Collins took the reserves to Doncaster on Wednesday afternoon. He is already immersed in the role. ‘I love this club. I’ve been here a long time and I know how the fans think,’ says the Pontefract-born defender who signed from Hull in 2008. Collins congratulates Jonathan Franks after Hartlepool's victory away to Exeter City on October 11 . ‘Hartlepool is the same as where I’m from – working-class people who want their team to have effort, energy and determination. I’m from that background and I understand it. ‘The young lads here are honest, hard-working and desperate to do well. I’m not afraid to play them one little bit. I know what they’re capable of. ‘As soon as I was asked by the chairman to take care of things then I knew within 10 minutes who I wanted to play. ‘One lad, Kieran Green, came up to me and gave me a hug when I told him he was going to make his debut and he did the same after the game. He’s infectious and desperate to be a footballer. I love that.’ Collins, too, shares the hunger of his young player. For while he may not be sleeping, it hasn’t stopped him dreaming of becoming the club’s manager.","Sam Collins took over at Hartlepool after Colin Cooper quit the club .

"Sportsmail runs the rule over eight future stars to look out for from English clubs in the new Under 21 competition . The Premier League have out-manoeuvred UEFA and pressed ahead with the staging of a European Under 21 competition the governing body of European football attempted to block. When the Premier League presented their plans for a four-group tournament, involving Under 21 teams from eight European as well as eight English clubs, last month, UEFA refused to give it their approval. Even though the competition would address some of the concerns around player development that were highlighted by the FA’s England commission. But by staging the whole competition here in England, and organising neutral venues when two foreign teams meet, the tournament will not fall under UEFA’s jurisdiction. Nathan Ake (left) and Lewis Baker celebrate Chelsea winning the Under 21 Premier League final in May . Ashley Smith-Brown is one of the players Manchester City could select in the new tournament . It was only on Wednesday afternoon that the Premier League announced the tournament would be going ahead, with the first game  between West Ham and Athletic Bilbao taking place the same evening at Upton Park. Kick-off is at 7pm and tickets will be available at the stadium, with free entry for season ticket holders and additional tickets available at £3 for adults and £1 for children. As well as West Ham, the English clubs involved in the tournament are Chelsea, Everton, Fulham, Leicester, Manchester City, Norwich, and Sunderland.

"What is it with Liverpool and England? It’s only four months ago that their players seemed to dominate the national team and the club had apparently provided a blueprint for potential World Cup success. Their rampant attacking - though ultimately fruitless - charge towards the title at the end of last season was powered by the core of England’s World Cup team; Glen Johnson, Steven Gerrard, Jordan Henderson, Daniel Sturridge and, most thrillingly, most promisingly, Raheem Sterling. But what seemed to be a relationship with multiple mutual benefits didn’t last long. First Gerrard retired, despite Hodgson wishing him to stay on. Then there was Brendan Rodgers complaining bitterly that England had ignored their post-match recovery plan for Sturridge last month after the Norway friendly, resulting in the striker’s injury. Now Sterling says he is too tired to play for his country. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Roy Hodgson: Raheem came to me complaining of tiredness . Raheem Sterling came off the bench during England's win in Estonia . Sterling won the free kick on the edge of the box which lead to Wayne Rooney's goal for England . Rodgers looks like a re-incarnation of Sir Alex Ferguson, with club always trumping country while Hodgson appears to have buckled under the pressure applied by the Liverpool manager. Hodgson of course would deny this. He argued passionately on Sunday night that dropping Sterling against Estonia was merely the most sensible option at the end of what has been a phenomenal six months for the 19-year-old. 'In this particular moment, it’s a no brainer situation,' said the England boss. Yet, when he adds, ‘I’m pretty sure when he goes back to Liverpool they’ll sort him out and come Sunday (against QPR) you’ll see him flying around,’ it’s difficult not to raise a Carlo Ancelotti-sized quizzical eyebrow. What was it about the 45 minutes against San Marino that so fatigued him? Sterling (second right) started on the bench after he complained of feeling tired during training on Saturday . Sterling speaks with Roy Hodgson on Saturday night as the player inspect the pitch in Tallinn . The mental strain of the game is the most widely held explanation, a suggestion at which Hodgson hinted. 'It isn’t quite as simple as the training you’re doing maybe taking some juice from your legs,' he said. 'There is an awful lot going on in your head as well.' Yet he would surely have been wiser simply to say that he had taken the decision on Sterling’s behalf, rather than revealing that the player had pronounced himself tired. If Hodgson had taken full responsibility for the situation, which he could have easily done after the match had been won and there was no risk of being ridiculed for a left-field selection, the story would all have been much less of an issue. Now it’s all about how much young players want to play for England and Sterling’s frame of mind, a much more loaded and unpredictable news agenda. Sterling has featured in 10 games for Liverpool this season and has played more than 1,000 minutes . Sterling played for Liverpool in their 2-1 win over West Brom on October 4 before joining up with England . Add in the fact that Hodgson himself was a short-lived and unpopular manager at Liverpool – scepticism for the current England side seems most pronounced on Merseyside – then the potential for misunderstanding and conflict seems ripe. Rodgers’ reaction this week will be fascinating. Will he be grateful Sterling had been given a break? Or annoyed that his young star has been thrust into the limelight? Certainly we know which questions are going to dominate his press briefings this week and they won’t be his potential tactics to take on QPR. Interestingly, we’ve been here before with England and Liverpool, in 1977. Then, one of Europe’s greatest ever teams stood on verge of dominating the European Cup and, although there was significant Irish, Scottish and Welsh contingent, within the side were a number of Englishmen. Ron Greenwood, who had just started as England manager, must have relished the prospect of fusing club and country. It never quite worked out like that. Brendan Rodgers looks like a re-incarnation of Sir Alex Ferguson by putting club before country . In his first fixture, Greenwood picked six Liverpool players in Ray Clemence, Phil Neal, Terry McDermott, Emlyn Hughes, Ray Kennedy and Ian Callaghan. A seventh, Kevin Keegan, his captain, had only just left the club to join SV Hamburg. The match was a friendly against Switzerland at Wembley and England drew 0-0, hardly the most inspiring start. And while Liverpool went on to add to their 1977 European Cup triumph in 1978, 1981 and 1984, through that period England struggled, Greenwood coming under pressure as his team only scraped into the newly-expanded 1982 World Cup finals and then failing to reach the 1984 European Championship under Bobby Robson. Ron Greenwood had Terry McDermott (second left) and Phil Neal (third left) in his England side . Steven Gerrard celebrates while playing for Liverpool but looks downcast while on England duty . Jordan Henderson has emerged as a key midfielder for both Liverpool and England . Clearly club and country can work in tandem, as Barcelona/Spain and Bayern Munich/Germany have proved in recent international tournaments. And even if four months on from the World Cup, it now looks like Arsenal will be providing the foundations of the England team, the national side still owes a huge debt to Rodgers’ Liverpool. I believe the manner in which his side took on the Premier League last season helped sway Hodgson towards a more attacking, youthful approach. Dr Steve Peters (left), the acclaimed psychiatric adviser, works with both England and Liverpool . Daniel Sturridge looks frustrated playing for England during the World Cup but celebrates at Liverpool . On Sunday night Jack Wlshere was talking about the ‘five-second fury’ in which the England players try to press to win the ball back within the first five seconds of losing. It was especially evident  in Tallinn and it’s a tactic straight out of Melwood. The diamond with Sterling at its tip, the full backs pushing on: all have been made fashionable by Rodgers and have the potential to turn England into a force once more. In Steve Peters, the two managers even share a psychiatric adviser. Perhaps he can get their inner chimps to calm down and agree on a common strategy for Sterling. For England have so much to gain from Liverpool and Sterling thriving and maybe this time, unlike in the late 70s and early 80s, their energy can be harnessed to forge a successful national team.","Raheem Sterling did not start for England in Estonia after complaining of feeling tired .

"Football fans continue to be squeezed for every penny by inflation-busting ticket price rises, a survey into the staggering cost of following your team has revealed. The cheapest match-day ticket price across the top four divisions of English football has increased by an average of 4.4 per cent over the last 12 months — nearly three times the rate of inflation. The BBC Price of Football survey finds Arsenal have the highest adult match day ticket price at £97, though this is a reduction from £126 last season. Football fans up and down the country continue to be squeezed as ticket prices rise above the rate of inflation .

Arsenal also have the most expensive season ticket in the Premier League at £2,013 while their cheapest — at £1,014 — is still higher than the dearest season ticket at 17 other top-flight clubs. The Arsenal price, however, does include automatic entry to Champions League group matches and four other cup ties. The cost of watching Tottenham for a season is as much as £1,895 and the top-level season ticket price at Chelsea is £1,250. These prices are before extras such as travel, programmes, food, drink and merchandise such as replica shirts are taken into account.

Source: BBC Price of Football survey 2014 . The cheapest season ticket in the Premier League is £299 at champions Manchester City, while the lowest match day admission is £15 at Newcastle United. Fans' groups expressed dismay at the spiralling cost of watching the game. Malcolm Clarke, chairman of the Football Supporters’ Federation, said: ‘At the top of the game there is no excuse for prices to be rising higher than inflation. The prices should really be going down.’ The BBC survey found that the average price of the cheapest adult ticket across English football has risen at almost twice the rate of the cost of living since 2011. While the cost of living has increased by 6.8 per cent in that time, the price of the cheapest matchday ticket in the top four divisions rose by 13 per cent. Premier League fans have seen ticket prices go up by 15.8 per cent in the last three seasons but they are by no means the only ones to suffer. Prices in League One have jumped 31.7 per cent and League Two by 19 per cent in this time. But the average price in the Championship has gone down by 3.2 per cent. Buying food and drink at football grounds adds to the high cost of following a team . An Arsenal spokesman said: ‘Work is continually undertaken to offer tickets at various prices, with the highest match ticket only applicable for five Premier League fixtures in a season. ‘Across the course of a campaign we offer up to 300,000 reduced price tickets to adult and junior supporters from £5 and £10.’ Despite the often high prices, the Premier League said its stadia had been 95.3 per cent full this season. Premier League head of supporter services Cathy Long said: 'For the Premier League and our clubs keeping the grounds as full as possible is our top priority. The attendances so far this season are very encouraging, with more than 95 per cent of seats sold and average crowds tracking with last season’s which were the highest in English top flight football since 1949-50. 'This only happens because of the commitment of attending fans and the hard work put in by our clubs to fill their stadiums with a variety of offers, both of which led to a 3 per cent increase in season ticket sales and a 2.8 per cent rise in away attendance last season. 'We recognise that certain matches can be more challenging to attend than others but are encouraged to see clubs, through their commitment to the Away Supporter Initiative, make everything from ticket price reductions to special travel offers and reciprocal pricing deals available to their travelling fans.'

"A journalist with dual British and Swedish nationalities was shot dead today while talking to a translator on the streets of the Afghanistan capital Kabul. Nils Horner, 51, was declared dead on arrival at the city’s emergency hospital after reportedly being shot in the head at close range in the affluent Wazir Akbar Khan neighbourhood. Mr Horner had worked for Swedish Radio SR since 2001 as a foreign correspondent mostly in Asia and the Middle East, including Afghanistan and Baghdad. Journalist Nils Horner was shot dead while he was talking to a translator on a street in an affluent area of the Afghanistan capital . It is the second killing in two months to strike foreigners in the well-guarded area of the Afghan capital which is home to several embassies and media organisations. Police said they were investigating . whether it was an insurgent attack targeting a foreigner or whether the . motive was personal. A . guard at a restaurant across the street from where the attack happened . said two young men approached the journalist as he was talking to his . translator at about 11 a.m. on the side of the road. The area. The . guard, Mohammad Zubair, said one of the men pulled out a pistol and . shot Horner in the head, causing him to collapse in a pool of blood. He . said there was a single shot and the bullet then hit a nearby car, which . was left with a bullet hole. The witness said he and other guards called to the police at a nearby checkpoint and they cordoned off the area. Scene: Mr Horner was shot in the affluent Wazir Akbar Khan district (pictured) of Kabul, which is home to several embassies and media organisations . Taliban . spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid denied the group was responsible for the . attack, which came two months after the Islamic militant movement staged . a suicide bombing and shooting assault against a Lebanese restaurant . that killed 13 foreigners and eight Afghans in the same area. Suicide . bombings and other attacks are frequent in Kabul and elsewhere in . Afghanistan as insurgents fight to undermine confidence in the . Western-backed government. But assassinations of journalists and other foreigners in the capital are relatively rare. Mr Horner had worked for Swedish Radio SR since 2001 as a foreign correspondent mostly in Asia and the Middle East . Not . including Horner, at least 29 journalists have been killed in . Afghanistan since 1992, most of them after the 2001 U.S.-led ouster of . the Taliban, according to the New York-based Committee to Protect . Journalists. Sayed Gul . Agha Hashimi, the head of the Kabul Criminal Investigation Department, . said police were questioning the journalist's driver and translator as . part of the investigation. Hashimi said the journalist died while being treated at the hospital. Swedish Embassy counselor Christian Nilsson said the body had been transported to the morgue. Anne Lagercrantz, head of news at Swedish Radio, said the newsroom was in deep shock. She said Horner spoke to the desk in Stockholm early on Tuesday and they agreed that he would go out and do interviews ahead of the April 5 presidential election. When people in the newsroom saw reports that a foreign journalist had been shot in Kabul, they tried to contact Horner by email but got no response. They then called his mobile phone, and a doctor answered saying Horner had been shot and killed, Lagercrantz said. Swedish Radio chief executive Cilla Benko said two men approached Horner and shot him in the back of his head. Benko said Horner was very safety conscious but was prepared to take risks. 'This was his life,' Benko said. 'He didn't want to do anything else.' Swedish Radio officials said there were no known threats to Horner. The attack came as security in the capital was tight amid fears of violence in connection with the funeral of Afghanistan's powerful Vice President Mohammed Qasim Fahim.","Nils Horner, 51, was reportedly shot in the head at close range in the affluent Wazir Akbar Khan neighbourhood .

The new report was published by the White House's Office of National Drug Policy which is affiliated with the RAND Drug Policy Research Center and draws on data between 2000 and 2010. Each year, the National Drug Policy office totals how much Americans spend on cocaine, heroin, marijuana and meth while also estimating the number of chronic users. 'Our analysis shows that Americans likely spent more than one trillion dollars on cocaine, heroin, marijuana and methamphetamine between 2000 and 2010,' said Beau Kilmer, the study's lead author and co-director of the RAND Drug Police Research Center. That's an average of $100billion a year. The report does not attempt to explain changes in drug use or the impact of drug control strategies. However, the dramatic increase in marijuana use may be attributed to the fact that there was an increase in people who reported daily or near-daily use of weed in recent years. New vice: Meanwhile, marijuana use went up 30 per cent and may be attributed to more users using the substance on a daily or near-daily basis . Data on marijuana use was mostly taken from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health while statistics on the other three drugs comes from the Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring Program (ADAM). Federal funding for ADAM was halted this year, which may mean less-reliable data in the future. 'The ADAM program provided unique insights about those who abused hard drugs and how much they spent on these substances,' said Jonathan Caulkins, a study co-author and the Stever Professor of Operations Research and Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University. 'It's a tragedy that 2013 was the last year for ADAM. It is such an important data system for understanding drug problems.'","The spike in marijuana use and decline of cocaine was noted in a report published by the White House's Office of National Drug Control Policy .

"As the hosts of the next World Cup and Olympic games, Brazil will soon be welcoming people from around the globe to its shores. But after visiting the country for a new Channel 4 series that starts this evening, Daisy Donovan has concluded it is not a place for the 'faint-hearted'. Or indeed for those who believe women should not be treated as disposable sex objects. Ms Donovan was shocked by the popular television shows beloved by the nation that seemingly objectify and degrade women. Scroll down for video . What degree? Presenter Daisy Donovan meets Miss Bum Bum finalist Laura Keller who said she's trading on her beauty and not her brains to become famous . Feast of flesh: Daisy observed that most of the women she met in Brazil appeared to be wearing just dental floss . One of these programmes is called 'Miss Bum Bum' - a reality TV show to find the nation's best bottom. Ms Donovan describes the contest as 'a spectacular feast of the flesh'. Girls from every walk of life are whittled down by a public vote to 15 finalists by undertaking a range of tasks  - all while wearing thongs that show off their derrieres. The final is a catwalk show where the women gyrate and parade in their skimpy bikinis while the cameramen take gratuitous rear and up-skirt shots. Ms Donovan said she felt awkward watching the final, adding: 'It's a bit disconcerting being a woman here and not dressed in dental floss.' 'It's humiliating . but at the same time there is the status that comes with it . so you end up forgetting about the humiliation because you are on TV' She met one of the finalists, Laura Keller, 23, who has a degree in sports science but admitted she is happy to hide her intellect on the show in favour of flaunting her body. She said: 'In Brazil, to work in TV and media we . need to get in through the backdoor which means that first of all we . need to show our beauty. Once you have you foot in the door then you . will be able to show your intellectual skills.' One male Brazilian journalist explained to Ms Donovan why Miss Bum Bum was such a popular TV show with both men and women of the country: 'Brazilian . woman like to be, not exactly objectified, but they like to be admired. Brazilian women have the highest self esteem in the world.' Bottoms up: The Miss Bum Bum contest is one of the country's most watched TV shows . Ms Donovan found another TV show that illustrates the country's 'questionable fixation with women' in Pânico, is a Brazilian institution which has been on the air for the past eight years. Ms Donovan said: 'Every week the show features the Panicats, a troop of bikini clad women who compete in spectacularly pointless games.' 'As we are portrayed as only having a beautiful body we are kind of a disposable thing - so if you don't agree . with something you will get eliminated and someone else will replace . you' She noted that the games - including one where women in skimpy outfits boxed on roller skates and another where women pretending to be mice have to eat cheese despite being held back by elastic around their faces - can be as painful as they are humiliating. She met one of the retired 'Panicats', Ariane Steinkopf, 23, who confided that she had found the experience humiliating but she did it for the fame. She said: 'Being honest with you it's humiliating . but at the same time there is the status that comes with it . so you end up forgetting about the humiliation because you are on TV and . it has good ratings.' The Miss Bum Bum final involves a catwalk show where the women gyrate and parade in their skimpy bikinis while the cameramen take gratuitous shots . Ariane said during her six months on the show she did things such as mud wrestling another woman in bikini and plunging down a water slide naked to land in a tiny paddling pool. Ms Donovan observed of the show: 'It turns out that Panico can do whatever they want to young women in the name of entertainment.' Ariane said she did have a limit to what she was prepared to do - but that ultimately led to her dismissal. She said: 'As we are portrayed as only having a beautiful body we are kind of a disposable thing - so if you don't agree . with something you will get eliminated and someone else will replace . you. 'There are so many things I refused to do and somethings I'd never . do, this is one of the reasons they decide to fire me from the programme.' Ms Donovan investigated TV shows in Brazil as part of her new four-part series, The Greatest Shows on Earth, that uncovers how 'television is the window into the soul of a nation' by exploring what popular TV reveals about a county and its culture. In future episodes she will discover how Egyptians love to see terrified celebrities kidnapped at gunpoint in a popular prank show while in India dance shows rule the small screen. The Greatest Shows On Earth begins tonight (Monday 17 June) at 10pm on Channel 4.

Gatland, whose squad includes six props, said: ‘It’s important that he (Jones) continues to keep working. We have had that conversation with him. ‘He looks in reasonable shape physically and there are other aspects of his game, particularly around the field, that we want him to keep working on and improving. ‘Definitely, the door is not closed for Adam Jones or James Hook. We know what Adam Jones is capable of giving us and I am sure if there is an injury or we need to look at bringing someone like Adam back, then we are able to do that. Veteran Wales tight-head Adam Jones, in action for Cardiff (right), has been left out of the 34-man squad . Gloucester fly-half James Hook has also failed to make the cut for the forthcoming Autumn Series . ‘With the scrummaging rule changes, that put a lot of pressure on tighthead props. It probably dropped the value of tightheads by half overnight and what has become paramount is the ability of front rows to be more mobile.’ Ospreys prop Nicky Smith is the solitary uncapped player, with Sam Warburton confirmed as captain.

"Louis van Gaal admits Manchester United do not have the look of Premier League title contenders despite spending more than £150million on new players this summer. Van Gaal's first task after taking over at Old Trafford was to guide United back into the Champions League and his team occupied fourth place for the duration of the international break. The Dutchman completes a relatively kind introduction to life in English football with a trip to West Bromwich Albion, but that is followed by games against Chelsea and Manchester City. VIDEO: Scroll down for Van Gaal views on United's struggles in the final half hour of games . Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal has had some mixed results at Old Trafford so far this season . Although Ander Herrera could return at The Hawthorns with the help of a corset to protect his broken rib, the Spaniard is the only one of nine injured players expected to feature. Asked if United would be contenders with a fully-fit squad that now includes Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao, Van Gaal replied: 'You have your hopes but I do think there are stronger teams in the world now. 'We have to make a team and that's why I have a period of three years. I hope we can fulfil the dream we have. Chelsea has already a lot of time. 'When you have three months with 10 players injured you cannot have a big progression. You are always playing with a different team. 'I don't think that 11 points out of seven games is better than I expected. I think it is good enough to be in fourth place and nothing more.' Van Gaal broke the bank to bring international stars Radamel Falcao (left) and Angel di Maria to Old Trafford . Van Gaal believes he can draw on his bittersweet experience as Bayern Munich coach to turn United into challengers again. After his first back-to-back wins in the Premier League, it perhaps seems odd that the 63-year-old should be discussing turning points but Van Gaal did not enjoy watching United hang on for successive 2-1 wins over West Ham and Everton at Old Trafford. He is demanding a significant improvement. Van Gaal sees similarities with his brief reign at Bayern Munich five years ago when he struggled to impose his philosophy on the players, risking the sack as the club suffered their worst start in 15 years while he tinkered with the line-up and tactics. Anderson (left), Anders Lindegaard and Juan Mata are all smiles at United's training base in Carrington . Van Gaal received a major boost this week when Phil Jones (left) and Chris Smalling returned to training . Van Gaal signed Dutch star Daley Blind from Ajax for £14million during the summer . His plans came together in an emphatic Champions League win over Juventus in Turin which saved his job and kick-started the club's season. Bayern went on to win a league and cup double, although they lost to Jose Mourinho's Inter Milan in the Champions League final. 'Do you remember when we had our revival?' said Van Gaal, who asked for three months before he was judged at United. 'We won 4-1 at Juventus, a fantastic game, and that gave us that psychological benefit. 'That was the end of November. There is still a month to go. But then it will be four months — I'm sorry. It was very stupid to say three months because you are only talking about three months. 'It is the performance that counts. Always the performance goes up and down. When that date or match is (that gives us a lift), is dependable.' Van Gaal is concerned United flagged in the last half-hour against West Ham and Everton. Indeed, a club renowned for late goals are yet to score after the 63rd minute all season. He added: 'It's the game, it's the style, it's the formation, it's the philosophy that we have to judge and not the points because the points are coming. Against Everton we could not say it was very good. The first hour maybe, but a game lasts 90 minutes. 'Fitness is maybe a point because I have said that I have adapted my intensity of training sessions to a lower level. But I think we are fit enough because what I see of my players they are fighting to the last minute. They are willing to do everything, so I'm very happy with their passion. 'We have to learn to kill the game and you cannot do that with one or three or eight players. We have to do it with 11 players and all of them have to think the same otherwise you lose balls unnecessarily and then are going back instead of forward. That's what we have to do but that takes time.' Ander Herrera could return to action against West Brom with the help of a corset to protect his broken rib .

"Thibaut Courtois has revealed how Petr Cech gave him tips and advice about protecting his head in English football’s danger zone after seeing him hurt in a collision with Arsenal’s Alexis Sanchez. Courtois was forced off after clashing with Sanchez two weeks ago and Cech, who required emergency surgery after fracturing his skull at Reading in 2006 and still wears a headguard as a result, was keen to share his expertise on the subject. The two Chelsea goalkeepers went away on international duty but that did not stop the Czech calling and sending text messages to his Belgian clubmate with advice about using his shoulders and back to protect his head when diving among the boots. Thibaut Courtois suffered a heavy blow when he came out to challenge Alexis Sanchez a fortnight ago . Sanchez immediately showed concern for Courtois as the keeper appeared badly hurt on the pitch . Courtois said: ‘He told me that in the Premier League, maybe some strikers really go in against the keepers, so sometimes it is better to protect your head, to go down quicker and with your back or your shoulder protecting your head. ‘That was a tip he gave me and it’s good because, when you come into a new league sometimes things are different. ‘In Spain there is more organisation, maybe more football, while here maybe some teams are going quicker with the long ball and rushing it to the front. The Belgian was escorted up the tunnel and was immediately treated by paramedics in the dressing room . 'It’s maybe more physical here and maybe the referees don’t whistle as quick as they do in Spain.’ Courtois recovered to play twice for Belgium during the international break and was back in the Chelsea team at Crystal Palace on Saturday, which meant a return to the bench for Cech, who had replaced him during the first half against Arsenal. The two players are duelling for the same place in the team and Cech must be smarting having been the club’s undisputed No 1 for a decade, but it speaks volumes that he is so quick to call and text with offers of help. Petr Cech was injured in a collision with Stephen Hunt in 2006, suffering a depressed fracture to his skull . Cech lies on the floor after the collision, and has worn a protective cap since the incident .","Petr Cech suffered a depressed fracture to his skull in 2006 .

"Arsene Wenger will have Aaron Ramsey and Mikel Arteta fully fit and firing for Wednesday’s Champions League trip to Anderlecht, with Theo Walcott not far behind. But on this evidence, it’s the defensive cavalry that Arsenal desperately need at the moment. The Gunners had 25 shots on goal during Saturday’s draw with Hull, dominating for all but two moments – the two moments when clinical Hull breached their makeshift back line to earn a point. Arsenal players protest after Hull City's first goal on Saturday but their defensive instability is apparent . Arsene Wenger bemoaned mistakes at the back after the 2-2 draw at the Emirates Stadium . One plus side is that Aaron Ramsey (as well as Mikel Arteta) is back and fit for the game against Anderlecht . Mohamed Diame has scored four goals from just four shots on target in the Premier League this season. ‘I think the way we concede goals at the moment is too easy,’ Wenger complained afterwards. ‘In these kind of games, when you defend you can’t afford this kind of mistake. You cannot concede a goal like we did, it is simple. ‘Where we were guilty I don’t think was in the build-up – we have shown some great quality today – but where we are guilty is to give two goals away from nothing.’ Wenger had a point. Mohamed Diame muscled his way past three defenders to score Hull’s first and Abel Hernandez towered above Per Mertesacker to head home their second. Aside from that, Hull barely crossed the half-way line, retreating further and further back until Danny Welbeck finally rescued Arsenal in stoppage time. Shorn of the injured Laurent Koscielny and Mathieu Debuchy, and the suspended Calum Chambers, Arsenal fielded 19-year-old Hector Bellerin on the right and left-back Nacho Monreal alongside Mertesacker in the middle. With Debuchy out for some time and a difficult call to make on whether or not to send Koscielny for surgery on a troublesome Achilles, Wenger needs to reinforce his rearguard and January can’t come soon enough. Spaniards Hector Bellerin and Nacho Monreal warm up ahead of the game due to defensive injuries . Celtic's Virgil van Dijk (left) and Dortmund's Mats Hummels (right) would be ideal January recruits . Hull's left back Andrew Robertson (right) could also be an option in the winter . Jack Wilshere shows his frustration during the game and later went off injured after the hour mark . Anderlecht missed the chance to pull five points clear in the Belgian Pro League as they were held 1-1 at Mechelen on Saturday. Alessandro Cordaro put the hosts ahead midway through the first-half but Steven Defour replied just after the hour to preserve Anderlecht’s four-point advantage at the top. Celtic’s Virgil van Dijk and Hull’s Andrew Robertson are two possible targets, though Borussia Dortmund’s Mats Hummels would be ideal. Dinamo Zagreb’s Marcelo Brozovic, a deep-lying midfielder, could also be brought in to protect the defence. The contrast between now and a year ago is apparent. Arsenal have conceded 11 in the Premier League so far, just two more than at this stage last season. But those 11 have been more evenly spread and five of their eight matches have been draws. 12 months ago, they had won six of eight and sat top of the table. Presently, Chelsea and Manchester City are disappearing over the horizon and this comes after Arsenal spent £77m strengthening in the summer. ‘Look, I don’t look at Chelsea,’ said Wenger bluntly. ‘I look at our performance. It’s a shame that we didn’t win today and it’s a shame because there is a good spirit in the side, a lot of quality in there. ‘Let’s focus on winning the next game. Football is made of pragmatism and realism so let’s focus to go to Anderlecht and win the game.’ Mohamed Diame equalised, who was down injured shortly before and Arsenal players were furious . Abel Hernandez celebrates after giving Hull City a 2-1 lead against Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium . Danny Welbeck lifts the ball past substitute keeper Eldin Jakupovic to hand Arsenal a crucial point . Pragmatically and realistically, the title is already gone and the Champions League might not provide much comfort this week. Anderlecht are four points clear in Belgium and unbeaten in the league, though they have struggled in Europe. Ramsey came on for half-an-hour on Saturday and Arteta was on the bench, so both should be available. Walcott completed 45 minutes for the Under 21s on Friday night after nine months out but the trip to Belgium could come too soon. The contrast between now and the ‘Invincibles’ team of 10 years ago was not a subject Wenger was willing to address when asked, but 4,700 miles away in Goa, a member of that fabled team hit the nail on the head. When Robert Pires, now with Goa in the Indian Super League, was asked if Arsenal could still win the Premier League, he said: ‘It’s very difficult. The current squad lacks the physical power the Invincibles team had in players like Sol Campbell, Patrick Vieira, Gilberto Silva and Thierry Henry.’ Majority shareholder Stan Kroenke (centre) and chief executive Ivan Gazidis (left) were watching on . Alexis Sanchez was a bright spark for Arsenal in front of their fans, but even he shows his frustration . That was evident – Diame’s goal aside - as they hammered away at Hull’s tightly-packed defence in a second-half siege, trying to score the perfect goal rather than go direct, to the growing annoyance of the crowd. Even Wenger admitted: ‘We have to score the ‘super goal’ always. On corners, I don’t know how many corners we had today [they had 10, all wasted] but they were much taller and there were not many chances to score.’ The Frenchman insisted Arsenal had progressed in the last few years, but it’s Hull who are making the real strides. Steve Bruce, who was later spotted on the Piccadilly line heading to Euston and then Manchester for Sam Allardyce’s 60th birthday bash, was satisfied despite Welbeck’s late blow. ‘I’m pleased with the progress we’ve made, it’s been a quite remarkable couple of years,’ he said. ‘For goodness sake, we’re disappointed that we didn’t win at the Emirates. That wouldn’t have been possible two years ago. ‘We’ve got to keep moving with it because every other team does and we’ve probably gone quickly that everyone else but we’ve set ourselves some really, really high standards.’ The result was a positive one for Hull boss Steve Bruce - he said his players have set 'really high standards'","Arsenal drew 2-2 with Hull City at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday .

"Santiago Vergini's own goal set the tone for Sunderland's day at St Mary's.

Jeff Hopkins (Crystal Palace vs Millwall, 1989) Lobbing the goalkeeper from 25 yards is usually something you'd be telling your grandchildren about for years. Unfortunately for Hopkins, this clip has stood the test of time just as well. With a back-pass the only option left for Hopkins, the Wales international accidentally plays a deft volley perfectly over Perry Suckling. Palace won the game 4-3 over their London rivals. Frank Sinclair (Middlesbrough vs Leicester, 2002) It may not surprise you that Sinclair makes our list of greatest own goals and arguably his best came against Middlesbrough, although the cameraman wasn't expecting it. Sinclair tells it best when asked which own goal he was most embarrassed about. The now 42-year-old manager of Colwyn Bay says: 'Probably the one against Middlesbrough. Ian Walker was Leicester's goalkeeper and I tried to hit a backpass from about 35 yards. 'But I slipped and it went in. That was the most painful one because we ended up going down that year.' Leicester City's Frank Sinclair walks with his head down after scoring an own goal against Middlesbrough . Leicester striker Emile Heskey (left) consoles  Sinclair after an own goal in the Premier League . Tony Popovic (Portsmouth vs Crystal Palace, 2004) Crystal Palace were eventually relegated by a single point on the last day of the season in 2004-05, and Popovic's own goal against Portsmouth at Fratton Park didn't help matters. Trailing 2-1 in a rain-soaked Portsmouth, the Australian defender  put the game out of reach with a majestic flick into the back of his own net. A pupil of Gianfranco Zola, Popovic somehow got the ball into the top corner from a cross and it went down as one of the 'most beautiful' goals of all time. Tony Popovic (left) of Crystal Palace holds his head in his hands and made the gaffe against Portsmotuh . Lauren (Manchester City vs Arsenal, 2003) Their invincible season had it all. Goals, glamour and glitz on their way to Premier League title glory. This own goal by Lauren, however, was a momentary lapse during an otherwise flawless season. Under pressure from Trevor Sinclair's blistering pace, the defender takes a touch 30 yards from goal towards goalkeeper Jen Lehmann, and slots it beyond the German to make it 1-0. Arsenal won 2-1. Lauren's own goal against Manchester City in 2003 was a bump in the road during their incredible season . Lee Dixon (Arsenal vs Coventry, 1991) Safety first. That's the defender's mantra, but Dixon regrets opting for a back-pass this time. Dixon, with the ball 30 yards from goal, decides to loft it back to David Seaman with too much venom and it sails over the England international. Gary Lineker and Co on Match of the Day made it their regular go-to clip whenever Dixon featured. Lee Dixon of Arsenal looks dejected and his own goal that lobbed David Seaman went down in history . Peter Enckelman (Birmingham vs Aston Villa, 2002) Did he touch the ball? That's the big question. Either way, it goes down as one of the most bizarre own goals of all time by Aston Villa goalkeeper Enckelman. Birmingham met their bitter rivals Villa for the first time in a decade, and nobody expected a 3-0 win for the club who were so often in the shadow of the other. Olof Mellberg's throw-in to Enckelman went under the goalkeeper's foot and into the net. As if that wasn't bad enough, a few fans took to the pitch to boast, too. Chris Brass (Darlington vs Bury, 2006) A straight-forward clearance proved anything but for Brass. With the ball bouncing, the former York manager swiped to clear the ball from behind, only to have it cannon off his face and into the back of his own net. Kasper Schmeichel in goal could do nothing. Bury came back to win 3-2 but Brass's nose - and ego - took a severe beating that day. Djimi Traore (Burnley vs Liverpool, 2005) He didn't often score winners during his seven-year spell at Liverpool, and Traore is mainly remembered for this own goal against Burnley. Anyone who tries to replicate a Zinedine Zidane drag-back in the six-yard box runs the risk of being punished, and Traore learned that the hard way in 2005. Liverpool lost 1-0 at Championship side Burnley and were knocked out of the FA Cup. Liverpool's Djimi Traore knocks the ball into his own net watched by goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek . Traore reacts after his gaffe against Burnley as Liverpool were knocked out of the FA Cup third round . Traore finds himself in the net after replicating a Zinedine Zidane drag-back in the six-yard box . Wayne Hatswell (Forest Green vs Morecambe, 2000) All Hatswell had to do was coolly clear the danger. Instead, he found the top-right corner. You're forgiven if you hadn't heard of the Forest Green defender before, but this FA Cup blunder helped cement Hatswell's place in own goal history. Seemingly under no pressure, Hatswell tries to swipe the ball to safety but slices it into his own net.","Santiago Vergini's own goal was first of eight strikes against Sunderland .

And he combined that physicality with astute awareness to force Steven Caulker’s own goal as Liverpool grabbed a dramatic winner. He left the field to a chorus of boos, but won’t have cared one iota.

"Plastic banknotes which can survive a hot 90-degree washing machine cycle could arrive in Britain within three years, the Bank of England said yesterday. In a break with tradition, the Bank is considering ditching the current £5 and £10 notes – which are made from cotton paper –and replacing them with ones made from polymer. The new notes last for more than twice as long, stay cleaner as they are resistant to dirt and moisture and are almost impossible to tear. The Bank of England could introduce polymer £5 and £10 notes (pictured) within three years that can survive a spin in a washing machine . The move will save the Bank more than £100million over a ten-year period because of the new banknote’s improved durability. A typical £5 note currently lasts for two years. The new ones would last for just under six years, it was announced yesterday. Plastic notes were introduced in Australia in 1988 to try and stop counterfeiting. They are due to be issued in New Zealand, Romania, Mexico and Vietnam and current Governor of the Bank of England introduced them in his native Canada. A special one-off plastic £5 was previously issued in Northern Ireland to commemorate the Millennium. The bank says the introduction of plastic notes will save about £10million a year as they will not have to be replaced so often. Polymer £5 notes will measure 125mm by 65mm, smaller than the current note. Supporters of polymer notes say they are more hygienic, harder to tear and more difficult to counterfeit. But critics say they stick together and are slippery. And . they can also be recycled to create items including plant pots and . garden furniture – a move which is likely to please Diana Carney, the . wife of the new Bank governor and a committed environmentalist. Her . husband Mark was at the helm of the Bank of Canada when polymer notes . were introduced in 2011, and is importing the idea to Britain just 11 . weeks after taking over the top job. The . Bank said yesterday it will initially look only at changing £5 and £10 . notes, with the new £5 featuring Sir Winston Churchill becoming the . first polymer note in 2016. But they are planning to hold focus groups and meetings in shopping centres to test public opinion about the scheme. And if the feedback is overwhelmingly negative the Bank have promised to scrap the idea altogether. The new notes will still feature the Queen and a well-known person, but will be slightly smaller than the current note. The £5 note is now 135mm by 70mm. The new one will measure just 125mm by 65mm. But they will continue to maintain ‘tiered-sizing’ – meaning that the higher the denomination, the bigger the note will be. The . Bank of England has tested the polymer notes in a 90-degree washing . cycle which seemed to have only ‘a minimal effect’, unlike the current . notes which can be ‘substantially degraded’. They then ‘submerged them . in liquids, including red wine,’ and found they could be wiped clean, . unlike a normal note which stains or disintegrates. Polymer . notes are already used in more than 20 countries, including Australia, . New Zealand, Mexico, Singapore and Mauritius as well as in Canada. The Bank of England said polymer notes would save them £10million a year because they last longer . New Bank of England Governor Mark Carney introduced polymer notes to Canada previously . But . the Bank of Canada was forced to deny that their notes were scented, . after authorities were inundated with queries about why people thought . that they could detect a ‘hint of maple’ when smelling the bills. Questions remained last night about how cash machines or payment machines would cope with the new notes. But . a spokesman for Link, the company which is behind 66,000 of Britain’s . cash machines, said: ‘The ATM industry will work closely with the Bank . to ensure their effective introduction.’ The . public consultation on the introduction of the new notes is due to . finish on 15 November and a final decision will be announced in . December.","Polymer bank notes could be introduced within three years .

"Manufacturers hope the cigarette-like sticks, which contain tobacco, will appeal to smokers . HeatSticks are set to be launched in Japan and Italy this year . Philip Morris has purchased a British e-cigarette maker, Nicocigs . The tobacco giant behind Marlboro has developed a new type of e-cigarette which it claims could reduce the harmful toxins found in smoke. Philip Morris International has spent more than £1.2 billion developing the electrically powered product - known as the Marlboro HeatStick - which heats tobacco rather than burning it. It believes the device, which will be available in Japan and Italy later this year, produces less toxins than an ordinary cigarette. The Marlboro HeatStick, pictured inside the iQOS pen holder, is heated to 350 degrees Celsius to create a tobacco-flavoured nicotine vapour. The pen is re-charged inside the battery, pictured behind the HeatStick, by plugging it into the mains using the USB connection and plug . The product, which looks like a cigarette, works when it is placed inside a holder – a device developed by an external company called iQOS. This heats the tobacco to a maximum temperature of 350C (660F) to create a tobacco flavored vapour. The holder can heat 20 'cigarettes' on a charge, and come with a mains USB charger. While most e-cigarettes (pictured) deliver a nicotine hit they do not contain tobacco - unlike Marlboro HeatSticks, which do . While the HeatSticks bear a resemblance to e-cigarettes there is one major difference – tobacco. E-cigarettes instead contain liquid nicotine, which is heated up and turned into a vapor that is inhaled or ‘vaped’ by the smoker. Since the tobacco is heated up rather than burned, the HeatStick produces an aerosol instead of smoke. Tommaso Di Giovanni, head of reduced-risk . product communications at Philip Morris, said: ‘We are conducting . extensive scientific studies to determine whether the HeatStick can . support claims of reduced exposure to harmful constituents in smoke . compared to smoking ordinary cigarettes.’ It isn’t the first time a product like this has been developed; heating technology was first introduced in the 1990s in the form of a cigarette called Eclipse but failed to catch on with smokers because they were difficult to use and didn't taste the same as a cigarette. How do e-cigarettes work? E-cigarettes are battery powered and contain a cartridge filled with nicotine. When the user inhales, the nicotine is drawn into an atomizing chamber, where it is heated and turned into a vapour. The vapour is inhaled like a normal cigarette and a nicotine hit is delivered to the lungs without tar or toxins.How do HeatSticks work? The cigarette-like sticks are heated to maximum of 350 degrees Celsius in a hollow pen-like device to create a tobacco-flavoured nicotine vapour. They contain tobacco which is heated instead of burned to eliminate toxins found in smoke. But manufacturers reckon the recent craze for e-cigarettes shows smokers are more open to dabbling in alternative products. J. Brice O'Brien, head of consumer marketing for Reynolds who created Eclipse, said: 'Smokers then considered Eclipse to be a very foreign, very different, very novel concept in smoking, where today, compared to electronic cigarettes, tobacco heating cigarettes are much more familiar.' Chief executive of Philip Morris, Andre Calantzopoulos, agrees. He said: 'Products like the HeatStick represent a potential paradigm shift for the industry, public health and adult smokers.' Meanwhile e-cigarettes remain a popular alternative for many smokers. So much so, that Philip Morris purchased UK-based e-cigarette maker Nicocigs for an undisclosed sum on Tuesday. Nicocigs, founded in 2008 and based in Birmingham, is best known for its Nicolites brand.

"Dreams of leaving school and making it big in London usually consist of breaking into something like TV, banking or politics. But when Josh Brandon, 21, made the journey three years ago from his home near Aberystwyth in Wales to find his fortune in the capital, his business plan had little to do with stocks and shares or television scripts. He had already decided to make his living by selling sex to other men. Josh, 21, claims he is a successful male escort because of his young looks . Josh said of his first job after leaving school: 'When I was in Wales and on dating websites, I did kind of know that I was attractive to guys, but then when I moved to London and started going to bars I realised there were lots of people who are attracted to me. 'So I figured out pretty early on that I could make money from being an escort. 'I don't think that I will do it for many more years, definitely not when I'm 30, but it has paid for my future so far.' Since then, the baby-faced 20-something has made almost a million pounds, owns his own cocktail bar in Chelsea, has a book in the pipeline and runs his own website selling sex toys. He is also the proud recipient of a dubious award: in 2011, he was named Sex Worker Of The Year at the Erotic Awards. With a few years of work under his belt, he is now putting his efforts into changing the British public's idea about prostitution, claiming it is a career just like any other. Josh is widely considered to be one of the most successful escorts of his generation, making hundreds of thousands of pounds a year from the business. His youthful appearance and knack for self-promotion means that he can command up to £1,500 a night for his services. Josh, 21, shortly after arriving in London from Wales - escorting was his first job in the capital . 'It’s based completely on time, if someone wants to have sex or go on a date or whatever, it’s all based on time, there are no hidden charges . 'I don’t usually do a whole week, because people can’t afford it, but sometimes I have gone to places like Miami - I would charge between £10,000 and £12,000 for that. 'Weekends are more normal, I get those fairly regularly and that’s around £4,000.' 'The clients are wide-ranging, with some just wanting to have sex,while others would rather do anything but that. He said: 'It totally varies, depending on the client, obviously some are just hiring me for sexual services. 'But then some are hiring me for the whole experience, where we would go out to the theatre or something, then for a meal and back to my place or to their hotel - that’s a boyfriend experience. 'There are the other ones who just want companionship, so they come to my place and we just sit on the couch and have a glass of champagne or a cup of tea and we just sit there and talk. Josh Brandon tried his hand at modelling but only as a sideline to his escort work . 'For those kinds of people it’s a confidence thing - if some of them haven't come out as gay and are never going to come out, it’s their only outlet to do that kind of thing. 'Or some of them might be older or even disabled and it has knocked their confidence to go out and meet people, so I'm an easier solution. 'Then there are the people who just don’t have time to meet people; the business people who are millionaires or billionaires that fly into London and just want convenience, they don’t have time to go on chat rooms or whatever.' Those billionaires are the biggest demands when it comes to his time. Despite their money, they may still be hiding their sexuality from friends and family, so put heavy restrictions on Josh's time, often making for bizarre situations. He said: 'I stayed at the estate of a Russian oligarch for a weekend, which was the biggest eye opener. 'It had a lake with a boat and 4,000 trees, several outhouses for staff and a garage the size of a townhouse - it made the properties in an episode of Cribs look like they belonged on Benefits Street. Josh being presented with the gong for Sex Worker Of The Year at the Erotic Awards in 2011 . 'He offered £3 million to basically buy me, he said that if I lived with him for two or three years, he'd write up a contract, transfer the funds and have everything done legally when it came to making payments. 'I would even have been restricted on where I could go - with breaks to see family and friends ""every now and then""' I was so insulted and I told him, ""When I'm ready to be a millionaire I'll make myself a millionaire thanks."" 'That was the first client and one of a small few I wasn't able to get along with, I refused to meet him . again. 'I rent my time, body and mind like every other working person does but I don't sell those things for someone to take ownership.' Another client even offered to hand over his estate when he died. Josh said: 'One guy in New York I met a few times developed a fixation, he even offered to sign his millions over to me in his will and buy me a penthouse in New York to live near him. 'I ended up leaving the country and cutting off all communication because it just got too much.' But this job was never going to come without huge risks - he has had several stalkers and after a couple of hairy incidents while working from his Soho flat, he also doesn't keep any sharp objects at home. He said: 'I have had situations where I’ve had to throw people out when I thought they might get violent or I thought they had no money. 'You have to be very streetwise - you have to be aware of your surroundings,  I don’t even keep sharp objects or anything that could be used as a weapon in my home. 'I have one sharp knife but will move it whenever a client comes around, so it isn't somewhere obvious. Josh works for a charity for sex workers called Ugly Mugs in his spare time . 'I've also had a few stalkers, people who have ended up hanging around and even sleeping outside my building.' But on the whole, Josh has been incredibly fortunate to have avoided any violent attacks, unlike many sex workers in the UK. It is for that reason that he now volunteers for a charity called Ugly Mugs, that offers assistance to escorts and prostitutes to protect them from violence. He said: 'My side of the charity is about awareness, speaking to escorts when they come to me for advice. Not all of us are in it out of choice either, I could leave tomorrow and get another job if I wanted to, but other people don’t have that. 'And the more I come out and talk about this issue, the more sex workers might be able to come forward and get the help they need.'","Josh Brandon, 21, became an escort three years ago .

"A Sunderland supporter could just be the unluckiest fan in Britain after watching his side get thrashed 8-0 at the weekend  - for the third time since 1968. Cass Farrar, 69, was devastated after the Black Cats were crushed by Southampton in the Premiership on Saturday, marking an unhappy hat-trick for the father-of-three. The retired headteacher has witnessed all three of his team's huge 8-0 losses since the club's first 46 years ago. Cass Farrar, 69, was devastated after the Black Cats were crushed by Southampton in the Premiership by  8-0 at the weekend - for the third time since 1968 . Mr Farrar first saw the team humiliated by the same score during an away game at West Ham's Upton Park, on October 19, 1968. He is a member of London's branch of the Sunderland Supporters' Association and had been living in the capital for two years when he saw Geoff Hurst rack up six goals, while fellow World Cup winner Bobby Moore, and Trevor Brooking took it up to eight. The second 8-0 defeat came at Watford on September 25, 1982, which he also attended to witness Luther Blissett put four past the Wearsiders' goal, with Ross Jenkins and Nigel Callaghan scoring two each. But despite his bad luck Mr Farrar, now of Greenwich, London, is sticking by his team. He said: 'It was abysmal. The floodgates were opened so easily. 'Some people say ""I'm never going again"" but I've already got my ticket for Crystal Palace. I'll be going.' Mr Farrar saw the team humiliated first by the same score during an away game at West Ham's Upton Park, on October 19, 1968 (left) Speaking about the latest game, he said: 'Vergini, well I sort of blinked and he put it in the Sunderland goal after 10 minutes. I thought 'What was that all about?' 'Mannone didn't have the best of games so he's probably to blame for two or three goals and then Bridcutt ran in. 'Southampton were so slick and I think we made them look good. 'I like Lee Cattermole and it looked like he'd given up and some of the others as well, but it was a shock.'

Former Celtic man Victor Wanyama celebrates scoring Southampton's seventh of the afternoon . He said one of his most vivid memories of the West Ham game include the goalscoring headers by England hero Hurst. And at Watford, he was haunted by a screen which beamed out an image of three yellow footballers dancing to celebrate a home score. 'It was set off eight times that day, so it was like it was up there all the time,' he said. Cass, is married to school teacher Bethan, 67, and dad to Lucy, 33, Sarah, 31, and James, 27 - an actor who played Liam Gilmore in Hollyoaks, also a Sunderland fan. Cass is helped in his bid to get tickets by Peter Robinson, who was in the year above him at Ryhope Grammar School, taking in about 20 games a season. He attended Saturday's match with Barry Emmerson, from Whitburn, and a classmate, and Barry's son Martin, a cricket commentator for BBC Newcastle.","Cass Farrar, 69, watched the Black Cats get crushed by Southampton .

She reportedly told a friend: 'He met my mum and said he's permitted to have several wives. I was comfortable with that. He's used me like a mop. He's just a pig.' Tiote's first wife has reportedly forgiven him for marrying another woman, and his agent confirmed to the Newcastle Evening Chronicle that he had married. Jean Musampa said: 'I can say that he did get married and that it is his second marriage. This is nothing unusual. He is a Muslim.' Newcastle United were not available for comment. Tiote gets a lift from Steven Taylor during a training session with Newcastle United . Tiote has been caught marrying a second woman in his native Ivory Coast to the fury of his mistress . The Ivory Coast midfielder during a training session with current Premier League strugglers Newcastle United . Alan Pardew talked over the weekend of his love for Tiote, who nearly moved to Lokomotiv Moscow in the summer. Newcastle manager Pardew said: 'I love him. He’s everything that you want in a Newcastle player. ‘He has the quality, and of course you’ll never underestimate the fact that he wants to win. ‘That’s something we have to be very careful about on training days! ‘I just love that he’s a winner. It can overcome so many obstacles as a footballer.' Polygamy was abolished in the Ivory Coast in 1964. Despite this, and the threat of six months to three years in prison or a fine, polygamy in west Africa is a very common practice. It tends to be more prevalent among the animist (a form of spiritualism) and the Muslim communities. In Senegal it was reported that nearly 47 per cent of marriages feature multiple women. It is legal in South Africa, Egypt, Eritrea, Morocco and Malaysia. In Iran and Libya it is legal with the written consent of the first wife. In other places it is illegal but the law is rarely, if ever, enforced. Some anthropologists believe that polygamy has been the norm throughout human history. In 2003, New Scientist magazine reported that, until 10,000 years ago, most children were fathered by a comparatively small number of men. Polygamous marriages may not be performed in the United Kingdom, and if a polygamous marriage is performed, the already-married person may be guilty of the crime of bigamy. Polygamous marriages legally performed in another country where the law allows it are not recognised for pension, immigration or citizenship purposes. It is estimated that there are as many as 20,000 polygamous Muslim marriages in the UK.","Newcastle United midfielder Cheick Tiote has reportedly married a second wife in Ivory Coast - much to the supposed fury of his mistress .

"Seven students have been charged with sex crimes after an investigation into a hazing on a high school football team found they trapped and assaulted new young players against their will. A parent of a player in the football program at Sayreville War Memorial High School, New Jersey, claims that seniors on the team would turn off the lights in the locker room, pin a freshman, stick their finger into the freshman's rectum and, at times, then put that finger in the young man's mouth. The attacks between September 19 and September 29 happened on a near daily basis, according to the report. Tonight, Middlesex County prosecutor Andrew C Carey issued a warrant for the arrest of seven pupils aged 15 to 17 at the school, a regional football power. Sayreville War Memorial High School has been rocked by allegations of bullying, intimidation and harassment among players on their popular football team. Here students are seen arriving at the school this week . Superintendent Richard Labbe said there will be a criminal investigation as there is 'enough evidence to substantiate that there were incidences of harassment, intimidation and bullying' on the football team . Sayreville War Memorial High School senior Kishan Patel, 17, stops to answer questions from the media as he leaves school Tuesday October 7, 2014, in Sayreville, N.J . A reported hazing incident that 'went too far' and is at the center of the investigation into the high school football team that has resulted in the cancellation of the school's football season. Patel believes when investigation is done, the cancellation of the school's football season will be seen as an overreaction . Six of the seven were arrested last night and the other is still being sought. Three were charged with aggravated sexual assault, criminal restraint, hazing and other crimes for an act of sexual penetration upon one of the children. The four other students were charged with aggravated criminal sexual contact and other crimes. Those in custody were awaiting a Family Court decision on whether they would be held at a juvenile detention facility or be released to their families. Their names weren't released because of their ages. On Monday night, schools Superintendent Richard Labbe announced he was canceling the rest of the season after the prosecutor's office substantiated allegations of hazing involving members of the school's football team. Parents in the township have complained that the whole team is being punished. However, the victims' families insist the gravity of the case warrants the drastic measures. 'In the darkness, a freshman football player would be pinned to the locker-room floor, his arms and feet held down by multiple upperclassmen,' reports NJ Advance Media. 'Then, the victim would be lifted to his feet while a finger was forced into his rectum. Sometimes, the same finger was then shoved into the freshman player’s mouth.' One official also told ABC News, '[The freshmen] would live in fear of seniors and juniors. They would race to the locker room to get changed and get out before the older kids got there.' This was all uncovered when a parent of one child notified authorities about what was happening at the high school. Superintendent Richard Labbe said there will be a criminal investigation as there is 'enough evidence to substantiate that there were incidences of harassment, intimidation and bullying'. He added that these incidences took place 'on a pervasive level, on a wide scale level and at a level which the players knew, tolerated and in general accepted'. 'Based upon that information, we are canceling the remainder of the football season for the freshman, the junior varsity and varsity football programs,' Supt Labbe said. According to CBS New York, Supt Labbe explained that the school first learned of the allegations last week through an anonymous allegation made to the Sayreville Police Department. 'They informed me that upon preliminary investigation, the matter in the incidents that occurred or that were alleged to have occurred, or were of such a serious nature that they were forced to turn the case over immediately to the office of the Middlesex County prosecutor,' he added. No players have been suspended and Supt Labbe would not comment on whether any personnel will be fired. He said canceling the season sends a clear message that this sort of behavior will not be tolerated. 'This district and this board of education is making a unified stance to say 'no.' No to bullying,' he said. Supt Labbe added that in addition to the criminal investigation, the high school is also investigating to see if similar behavior took place within any other sports. Speaking to CBS New York's radio channel, some parents claimed canceling the football program is not fair to innocent players. 'The students can't play, it's a ding on the entire community, it's a ding on the high school,' one parent whose son is on the team said. Upset: Audience members react as members of the Sayreville Board of Education  address a hazing incident that 'went too far' and is at the center of the investigation into the Sayreville War Memorial High School football team . Discussion: Members of the Sayreville Board of Education hold a press conference at the Selover School in South Amboy, N.J., to address a hazing incident that 'went too far' 'For all of them, the ones who are innocent, to have this taken away from them. They're being punished for something they did not do,' another parent added. A number of commentators on Twitter seemed to agree . I feel bad for those Sayreville players,' one person wrote. 'I couldn't imagine having something I work so hard for be taken away because of others poor choices.' But others praised Sayreville's zero tolerance approach to bullying. One person wrote: 'I'm so proud the district took a MAJOR stand against bullying.' 'Was the only choice the program had.' another wrote. 'People didn't want to listen and thought the sport should win out. Safety is priority.' Sayreville High School's football team - which one of New Jersey's top programs having won three sectional titles in four year - has already forfeited multiple games amid the hazing accusations, . Meanwhile, police are investigating former assistant coach of the Sayreville High School football team Charlie Garcia on drug charges. Garcia, 38, resigned from his position at the school after he was found with more than two boxes of steroids and more than a dozen syringes during a traffic stop late last month. According to NJ.com, he was charged with third-degree illegal possession of steroids, possession of hypodermic needles, driving with an expired license, failure to signal a lane change and possession of a controlled dangerous substance in a motor vehicle.","7 students 'assaulted new pupils' at Sayreville War Memorial High School .

"The internet craze for selfies has been branded the ultimate expression of vanity, with David Cameron and Barack Obama among those castigated for posing for self-portraits that were later put online. But now the selfie has been put to good use – celebrities are posting pictures of themselves to campaign against oil exploration off the coast of Ibiza, the Mediterranean playground for the rich and famous. Bearing home-made banners with the slogan ‘Ibiza Says No’, stars including Kate Moss, singer Sophie Ellis-Bextor, and DJ Fatboy Slim and his wife Zoe Ball have posted selfies on the internet and signed a petition lobbying the Spanish government not to lease territory to oil giant Cairn Energy. Campaign: Kate Moss, Charlotte Tilbury and an unknown friend hold up a home-made banner bearing the slogan 'Ibiza says no!' in a picture posted to the internet as part of a push to stop oil drilling off Ibiza . Not in my backyard: DJ Norman Cook, aka Fatboy Slim, and wife Zoe Ball show their support for the campaign . Protest: The singer Sophie Ellis-Bextor, whose tracks are iconic in the Ibiza club scene, and model Laura Bailey . The petition, which now has 60,000 signatures, will be submitted this week by the Ibiza Preservation Fund, a consortium of businesses and residents. Singer James Blunt, who lives on Ibiza, model Laura Bailey, make-up artist Charlotte Tilbury and designer Alice Temperley are among others who have also posted selfies to show support. Although it is best known as a party destination, Ibiza is a Unesco World Heritage Site. The deep waters around the Balearic island are home to the endangered bluefin tuna, the striped dolphin, the long-finned pilot whale and sperm whales. ‘We were horrified to discover that the Spanish government had quietly passed a law on Christmas Eve granting Cairn Energy rights to prospect for oil just 15 miles off our coast,’ says actress Lisa Bilton, who is helping to lead the campaign through the Twitter hashtag #ibizasaysno. Unesco World Heritage Site: It's not just a party island, the deep waters around Ibiza are home to the endangered bluefin tuna, the striped dolphin, the long-finned pilot whale and sperm whales . Sir Mick Jagger’s daughter Jade, who lives on the island, said: ‘We’ve been ignoring the environment for too long and now it’s time to speak out.’ Strictly Come Dancing star Ms Ellis-Bextor, a regular visitor to Ibiza, added: ‘It’s about having a conscience about the world we live in.’ It is the first time in the history  of the island that the Spanish government has leased its territory to an oil company for prospecting. Environmentalist Ben Goldsmith, a founder of the Ibiza Preservation Fund, said of the campaign: ‘People complain about Nimbyism, but if they’re not going to do it, then  who is?’","Not just a party hotspot, the island is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site .

"E-cigarettes could save millions of lives and should not be classed as a tobacco product, which would restrict their access, leading health experts have warned. They have published a letter after . claiming to have seen a leaked document from the World Health . Organisation (WHO) which labelled the e-cigarettes as a 'threat'. The letter urges health officials to consider the health consequences of such a move, amid fears e-cigarettes will become harder to obtain. Scroll down for video . France's health minister has proposed a ban on smoking e-cigarettes in public places . A move to classify e-cigarettes alongside regular cigarettes would . push countries into taking similar tough measures to restrict demand, . including raising taxes, banning advertising, introducing health . warnings and curbing use in public places. More than 50 researchers and specialists from around the globe have signed a letter stating that e-cigarettes have the potential to save millions of lives. As a result, they should not be regulated in the same way as conventional cigarettes, they say. The WHO is preparing to publish recommendations about e-cigarettes to governments later this year. A total of 178 countries are . parties to the international convention and are obliged to implement its . measures, with the United States the one notable non-signatory. The letter, addressed to Director General Margaret Chan, argues that low-risk products like . e-cigarettes are 'part of the solution' in the fight against smoking, . not part of the problem. The document says: 'These products could be among the most significant health innovations of the 21st century - perhaps saving hundreds of millions of lives. E-cigarettes should not be regulated in the same way as conventional cigarettes, the letter to the World Health Organisation argues . 'If regulators treat low-risk nicotine products as traditional tobacco products... they are improperly defining them as part of the problem. 'Regulators should avoid support for measures that could have the perverse effect of prolonging cigarette consumption.' The signatories include the leading smoking cessation psychologist Professor Robert West, from University College London, and experts who have advised the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) on its guidelines about reducing the harm from tobacco. Uptake of electronic . cigarettes, which use battery-powered cartridges to produce a . nicotine-laced inhalable vapour, has rocketed in the last two years and . analysts estimate the industry had worldwide sales of some $3 billion in . 2013. Research published last week by Professor West . found e-cigarettes can help improve the success rate of people trying to . quit smoking by 60 per cent compared to nicotine patches or gum. But critics say that not enough is known about the long-term effects of the devices, which deliver nicotine in a vapour. A WHO spokesman told the BBC: 'WHO is currently working on recommendations for governments on the regulation and marketing of e-cigarettes and similar devices. 'This is part of a paper that will be submitted to the parties of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control later this year. 'We are also working with national regulatory bodies to look at regulatory options, as well as toxicology experts, to understand more about the possible impact of e-cigarettes and similar devices on health.' Dr Penny Woods, Chief Executive of the British Lung Foundation, said: 'The overall impact of e-cigarette use on public health is currently unclear. While they could prove to be an important tool to help people stop smoking, the unregulated status of e-cigarettes is problematic. 'The concern is that the safety and effectiveness of e-cigarettes is still unknown. Until we have more substantial research we would encourage all smokers who wish to quit smoking to use ‘stop smoking’ services and approved nicotine replacement products.'","More than 50 experts have signed a letter sent to World Health Organisation .

"It was always going to be a tough battle to claim the title of Britain’s brainiest child. But viewers of Child Genius have questioned whether the Channel 4 show went too far as two boys were shown sobbing after losing the competition. When maths prodigy Rubaiyat, 11, was defeated by eventual winner Sharon Daniel the cameras zoomed in for a close-up shot of him bursting into tears. Scroll down for video . Upset: Eight-year-old Tudor Mendel-Idowu is shown crying as he lost the final of Channel 4 show Child Genius . Then viewers were also shown Tudor Mendel-Idowu – who is just eight years old – crying as he also lost to Sharon, 11, in the final showdown. Rubaiyat, who has an A* in maths at GCSE, was level on points with Sharon after correctly answering 16 questions on particle physics. They faced a tie-break until Sharon successfully challenged a wrong answer ruling on her specialist subject of the Battle of Stamford Bridge, meaning she won the point and got through to the final two. As the boys were shown in tears, viewers took to Twitter to criticise the ‘cruel’ competition. 'Exploited': Viewers took to Twitter to brand the programme 'horrible' as maths prodigy Rubaiyat, 11, (left) lost to eventual champion Sharon Daniel, 11 (right) One wrote: ‘Oh Rubaiyat, you’re breaking my heart! #ChildGenius – what a horrible competition!’ Another tweeted: ‘This programme is terrible – too much pressure on the kids.’ Afterwards, Rubaiyat’s father Miraz said he should be proud of himself for getting as far as he did. Physicist Dr Brian Wecht, who set the string theory questions, told Rubaiyat that most people needed a PhD to understand the subject and that he was ‘remarkable’. Earlier in the series Rubaiyat, from South London, was shown reading two books called How To Make Friends and How To Be Happy. He is trying to convince his parents to let him undertake a degree course. Winner Sharon’s mother Hepzibah said she had not pushed her daughter to study. The doctor from Bolton told the programme: ‘She has her own way of doing it.’ Sharon, who is a former under-11s UK girls’ chess champion, said her determined nature helped her win: ‘Once I set my mind on something I won’t give up.’ Tudor was visibly upset after he lost the final 10-6. His parents, Tolu, a 39-year-old pastor, and Gold, a 36-year-old NHS administrator, had put him through a rigorous coaching regime and were shown wincing or shaking their heads when he got a question wrong. Last night Claude Knights, chief executive of children’s welfare charity Kidscape, criticised the show for ‘exploiting’ children by filming them in ‘visible emotional distress’. She said: ‘A number of the parents were sadly too preoccupied with the end goal and their own ambitions to realise that their children were being taken beyond safe levels of endurance. ‘We also have to ask what aspects of intelligence were being tested, and what was the point of pushing these bright young minds “to their limits”, in for the most part, pointless tasks devoid of real context. The need to consider the nurturing and development of the whole child was ignored in favour of cruel entertainment.’ The competition is overseen by British Mensa and featured children aged seven to 12. A Channel 4 spokesman said chaperones and a psychologist were available for the children during and after filming and the families were happy with the show. ‘We take our duty of care very seriously indeed and have been guided by the Ofcom code and a set of bespoke processes and protocols throughout,’ he said. ‘[Rubaiyat] did extremely well in the competition and he and his family are very proud of his achievements.’","Maths prodigy Rubaiyat, 11, and Tudor Mendel-Idowu, eight, shown crying .

"Andrew Welsh arrives at Bolton Crown Court, Bolton, where he was sentenced for sexual activity with a child while in a position of trust today . A teacher was caught having an affair with a pupil when the girl’s mother found him  hiding under her bed. Andrew Welsh, who was 35 at the time, climbed into a drawer in the 16-year-old’s single divan bed after her mother returned home early. But the mother became suspicious when she saw that her daughter’s hair and make-up were out of place. She went into the bedroom, noticed ‘movement’ in the drawer and ordered him to get out from under the bed. Yesterday, Welsh, who is married, was sentenced to 14 months in prison, suspended for two years, after admitting six counts of sexual activity with a child by a person in a position of trust. Bolton Crown Court heard there had been sexual activity between the maths teacher and the Year 11 pupil six times between May and July last year. It happened at her house, at the home he shared with his wife and son, now three, and in his car in a Sainsbury’s car park. The pair had ‘full sex’ once at the girl’s home the day before they  were discovered. Welsh sent the girl dozens of explicit texts, including one that said: ‘Have you heard about today’s maths lesson? I’m going to figure out if 35 goes into 16.’ In others he called her a ‘minx’ and said she was ‘talented in bed’. Geoff Whelan, prosecuting, said Welsh, who turned 36 yesterday, was not teaching the girl at the time of  the offences. She had been meeting him in school for advice about depression for about three months before he invited her to his house to look at his art and they kissed, the court heard. Mr Whelan said the affair was discovered on July 19 when the girl’s mother pushed open her daughter’s bedroom door and saw a man’s suit jacket and a pair of man’s shoes. She then saw that a sheet was folded back and could see movement in the divan drawer and material inside that matched the suit jacket. When she demanded to know who was there, her daughter replied, ‘Mr Welsh.’ Mr Whelan added: ‘The mother ordered the defendant to get out from under the bed and she recognised him immediately as her daughter’s maths teacher from the school.’ The mother called the school and police and Welsh was arrested later that day. He told police that the sex was consensual, the girl was 16 and he did not believe she was a pupil at the time because she had finished her GCSE exams. The court heard Welsh bombarded the youngster with obscene text messages before having sex with her . Welsh tried to get the charges relating . to the abuse of a position of trust thrown out for the same reason, but . changed his plea to guilty when his application was rejected. Mr . Whelan said the girl now ‘worries about whispers and gossip’ but is . otherwise ‘coping very well’, but her mother ‘feels betrayed’. Nicola . Gatto, defending, said Welsh, a St Andrews University graduate, was a . man of ‘extremely good character’ with a seven-year ‘unblemished . history’ at the school, where he was assistant head of Year Ten. She . said his wife, a GP, described him as a ‘fundamentally good person’ and . had decided to stand by him,  but the affair had been ‘utterly . mortifying’ for her. Welsh is banned from teaching for life and now . works as a window salesman, she said. Miss Gatto added: ‘He’s lost his . standing in the community, he’s  lost his good character and he’s lost . the career he loved. ‘Quite what possessed him to embark on this . course of conduct is really unclear. He was flattered by the attention . that this young woman gave him. It seems that he became utterly carried . away with himself. Welsh avoided jail after Bolton Crown Court (pictured) heard the offences have ruined his career . ‘He now is going to bear the cost for . that because effectively he has ruined his life. It is going to take . many years for this man to piece his life back together again.’ Judge . Elliot Knopf told Welsh that the girl was ‘impressionable’ and he could . not attribute the affair to a ‘moment of madness’ because it went on . for ‘a good number of weeks’. He added: ‘You bear responsibility for what happened. You are nearly 20 years older than this girl. ‘You . allowed yourself to indulge in this behaviour and this activity in this . relationship. You allowed yourself to get carried away.’ As well as . the suspended prison sentence, Welsh, from Atherton, Greater Manchester, . was ordered to do 200 hours of community service and pay £500 . prosecution costs. He was also put on the sex offenders register for ten years.","Married Andrew Welsh befriended girl while she was taking GCSEs .

"David Cameron compared Russia’s hostility towards Ukraine with the build-up to the two world wars last night, as he warned economic sanctions could get tougher. The Prime Minister likened the situation to Belgium and Poland ‘being trampled on’ before wars broke out in Europe last century. Speaking to voters in Warrington, he said: ‘This year we are commemorating the 100th anniversary of the First World War, and that war in part was about the right of a small country, Belgium, not to be trampled on by its neighbours. 'Unacceptable': Russian president Vladimir Putin’s actions to ‘undermine Ukraine’s sovereignty’ were last night denounced by the G7 nations – the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States . ‘We had to learn that lesson all over again in the Second World War, when the same thing happened to Poland and Czechoslovakia and other countries. ‘In a way, this is what we see today in Europe. Ukraine is a country recognised by the United Nations, a country which has and should have every right to determine its own future ... it has the right not to have its territorial integrity impugned by Russia.’ Last night the G7 nations – the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States – denounced Russian president Vladimir Putin’s actions to ‘undermine Ukraine’s sovereignty’. ‘We once again condemn Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea, and actions to de-stabilise eastern Ukraine. Those actions are unacceptable and violate international law,’ a statement said. The Prime Minister talks to workers in Warrington: He promised he was not about to start a war in Europe . Threatening further measures to cripple the Russian economy, Mr Cameron said: ‘It will be a tightening of the ratchet unless Mr Putin changes his approach.’ He added: ‘We are not about to launch a European war, we are not about to send a fleet to the Black Sea, we are not looking for a military confrontation. 'What we should do is use the economic powers we have, the European Union and the United States of America, to demonstrate to Russia that what it is doing is unacceptable.’ This week, Europe and the US agreed tough sanctions against Russian banks, defence and energy firms.

"Juggling work and the school run can be hard enough, let alone  having to think about what to cook  for dinner. So one woman decided to ease the burden for busy mums – and turned her kitchen into a takeaway serving home-cooked meals. Every week day Kara Dexter whips up wholesome cottage pies, lasagnes and pasta bakes for families in her town using local ingredients. Freshly made: Kara Dexter in her kitchen. She began cooking more fresh meals after her eight-year-old daughter had to take time off school due to an illness . Asian flavours: (Clockwise from bottom right) Fishcakes and chicken satay, green chicken curry, Thai rice, red pork and red pepper curry and prawn crackers . Customer favourite: Mrs Dexter's chicken, chorizo and red pepper pie. She said: 'Tuesday pie night has proved to be popular and people get really excited about it' With as many as 20 orders to prepare in a . day, she has to get up as early as 5.30am so everything is ready for . collection during the afternoon school run. Mrs Dexter, 42, charges . £8 for a meal for one, £13 for two, £18 for four or £23 for six, and has . recently started a children’s menu with prices starting from £3 per . portion. ‘At first I thought it might be a service where busy people . might be interested in having one night off a week worrying about what . to cook and having to shop for ingredients,’ she said. ‘Then it just . took off. It seems to  have really captured the imagination of people, . especially the mothers in the school playgrounds. Family time: Kara cooks with her daughter Katie. The mother-of-two now has up to 77 customers a week who pay between £8 and £23 for a meal . Comfort food: Kara's chicken, chorizo and red pepper casserole. Customers have to order by 9am the day before, but Mrs Dexter said 'emergency meals' are sometimes available . Ingredients: Fresh fruit and vegetable play a big part in Mrs Dexter's menu. She buys all the meat she uses from a local butcher and the vegetables come from the local market . ‘Some customers . are families who want to spend more time with their children, but I also . have some elderly couples and young professionals who need a meal at . short notice. ‘The only downside is sometimes I’ve sold our own meals some nights so we’ve ended up with beans on toast.’ Mrs . Dexter used to rely on takeaways and eating out when she worked in . nursing, while her husband Mark, 45, is just as busy in his job as a . company director. Then last year their daughter Katie, eight, had to . take time off school due to ill health, so she began cooking more at . home for her and son Harry, six. After friends asked her for a . couple of meals a week she had the idea for her business, Kara’s . Kitchen, which is now her full-time job. Her customers in Knutsford, . Cheshire, have to order by 9am the previous day, although Mrs Dexter, . who has a food safety certificate and is registered with the local . authorities, makes some meals at short notice for regulars. She even . makes dairy and nut-free dinners for children with allergies, as well as . Indian or Thai feasts for families looking for an alternative to . takeaways. Sweet tooth: Mrs Dexter's chocolate sponge cake with a coffee buttercream filling, just one of the delicious meals she spends nine hours a day preparing for her customers . Brains behind the business: The mother-of-two began cooking more at home when her daughter had to take time off school. When she hosted dinner parties, family and friends would comment on her culinary talents . World cuisine: As well as traditional English food like fish fingers, Mrs Dexter's daily offerings include Indian curries, served with naan bread (left) and coq au vin (right) - a French favourite . It is all served on her own crockery, which customers wash . and return. Some of Mrs Dexter’s 77 clients have posted dozens of . thank you messages on her Facebook page. Judith Plant wrote: ‘Thank you, . your meal made my usual stressful Monday evening much easier and I . appeared to be a kitchen goddess!’ Penny Sproston said: ‘I had been . out since 8.30am this morning and to come home to this at 5pm and have a . lovely home-cooked meal ready for my family was perfect.’ Filling: Smoked haddock gratin is just one of the delicious meals on the menu. Mrs Dexter said that she has now bought new kitchen equipment and is getting better at buying the right quantity of food . Balanced meal: Customers can tuck into chicken kiev, layered potatoes and broccoli. Before she started Kara's Kitchen, Mrs Dexter said her family relied on ready meals and takeaways . Made to order: Risotto with a parmesan crust (left) and tomato and basil soup (right). Customers can request the size of the meal they would like - whether it is a meal for one, or enough to feed a family .","Kara Dexter, 42, cooks for up to 77 customers a week in her kitchen .

"A pensioner has been fined for leaving out tuna laced with antifreeze after five of his neighbours’ cats died. Donald Waterworth, 79, was spotted hiding the mixture in his garden by a woman whose pet had died a ‘horrific’ death a few months earlier. He admitted knowingly putting down poison and was fined £125 – however it could not be proved he killed the animals. Pensioner Donald Waterworth, pictured at his home,  admitted placing tuna laced with anti-freeze in his back garden. The investigation was sparked by the death of  five cats nearby . His next-door-neighbour Julie . McClumpha, 55, lost her beloved eight-year-old cat Treacle in October . last year. Meanwhile Linsey Bilsborough, 45, lost four cats – named . Tippex, Affro, Midnight and Lily – after they all became seriously ill . around the same time. Both . women reported that their pets became unwell suddenly and appeared in . pain. Vets suspected they had consumed a noxious substance and a sample . taken from Midnight’s bladder confirmed the presence of antifreeze. Mrs . McClumpha then spotted Waterworth creeping around outside his house in . Leyland, Lancashire, with a torch in March this year. She . said: ‘I thought it was strange because he had a security light and it . wasn’t on. I went upstairs and went into the room that overlooks his . garden and watched him. ‘I could only see his left arm and he was moving as you would if you were stirring something up.’ Tippex, left, and Afro, right suffered an agonising death after they are believed to have eaten the suspect fish .

"A grandmother ‘died of fright’ after a drug addict armed with a claw hammer banged on her patio door late at night. Hairdresser Carole Wall, 58, had been watching television with her husband when Kevin Chambers starting pounding on the door at 11.30pm on a Sunday, yelling that a gunman was trying to kill him. Mrs Wall collapsed while calling 999 at her home in Llandudno, North Wales and died of a heart attack, despite her husband’s attempts to save her. Carole Wall, 57, had an unknown pre-existing heart condition and suffered a heart attack in the incident . Yesterday Chambers, 37, was sentenced to two years in jail after admitting criminal damage and having an offensive weapon. Mr Wall, 58, had previously called for tougher charges to be brought against Chambers after an inquest in March found it was ‘probable’ the incident triggered his wife’s heart attack. He had desperately tried to revive his wife but it was unknown that she had a pre-existing heart valve condition and she suffered a heart attack. Mr Wall, a driver who had just celebrated his 38th anniversary with his wife, was too upset to attend Caernarfon Crown Court yesterday to see Chambers jailed for two years. Judge David Hale told Chambers: ‘As far as he [Mr Wall] is concerned you murdered his wife - in law you haven’t.’ Other members of the family were in the public seats and afterwards praised the judge for his comments and said they understood he was limited by law in the sentence he could pass. Prosecuting, Oliver King described how Chambers had discharged himself from hospital after surgery for septicaemia. Mr King said he became paranoid on heroin and cocaine, believing he was being pursued by a man with a gun. Kevin Chambers, pictured, was shocked to discover that Carole Wall had died and was 'profoundly sorry' At 11.30pm in September last year Mr and Mrs Wall and their 28-year-old son Neal were at their home relaxing downstairs when they heard banging and a voice shouting: ‘He’s trying to kill me. He’s got a gun.’ They were terrified at seeing Chambers with a claw hammer and Mrs Wall collapsed. Mr King said that due to Mrs Wall’s pre-existing heart condition it was highly likely that stress had brought on the heart attack. When police arrived Chambers was still agitated and was taken to hospital because of his septicaemia and kept in for a fortnight. He’d told police he believed he was being chased by a man with a gun and ran towards the house to seek help. Mr King said since that night Mr Wall and his son had not felt able to return to the house. In a victim statement Mr Wall called his wife the ‘only person he had ever loved’. The barrister said Chambers had 20 previous convictions for 37 offences, mostly for shoplifting and handling stolen goods, though while on bail in January he had been given a four weeks suspended sentence for punching someone in Sainsbury’s at Llandudno and stealing a Satnav. Defence counsel Andrew Ford said Chambers had been shocked to discover that Mrs Wall had died, was ‘profoundly sorry’ and appeared genuinely remorseful. After discharging himself from hospital Mr Ford said Chambers had become paranoid, confused, erratic and demanding help. He had not made any threats and after six months on remand was now receiving methadone to wean himself off drugs. A probation officer told the judge that Chambers had explained he had been hallucinating and ‘looking for help’. St David's Road, Llandudno, where the incident happened at around 11.30pm in September 2013 . Judge Hale pointed out that if, instead of drugs, Chambers had drunk two bottles of whisky and become hopelessly drunk, that would not be mitigation. He sentenced him to a month for damaging the door and a concurrent two years for having the weapon. He took into account the consequences and Mrs Wall’s accelerated death. Outside the court Mrs Wall’s brother Andrew Nelson said: ‘The greatest tragedy is that Carole was the most gentle, loving and giving person. To her, an act of violence was abhorrent. We are extremely grateful to the judge for his remarks.’ Carole’s sister Janine Roberts said: ‘We will never think that real justice has been done, but understand that the judge is constrained by the law and we are very grateful to him.’ The family said they were also grateful for all the support they had received, including from the media. At an inquest in March a Home Office pathologist said Mrs Wall had ‘severe’ heart disease and would have been at risk of sudden death. ‘In my view she wouldn’t have died when she did if this incident hadn’t occurred,’ he added. ‘She may have carried on for many, many years.’","Kevin Chambers, 37, beat on Carole Wall's patio door at 11.30pm .

"He overcame a very public battle with alcohol addiction a decade ago. Now Midge Ure warns the fact that drink is available ‘everywhere’ makes it frighteningly easy for people to turn into addicts. Midge Ure, seen here with his Visage bandmate Steve Strange in 1982, said it is not until you try and give up alcohol that you realise it is 'in every corner shop, it is in garages, it is on the motorways, it is everywhere' The former Ultravox singer condemned the widespread availability of alcohol in ‘corner shops, garages and on motorways’. The 60-year-old said: ‘It is fairly well documented I got myself into trouble with a bit of alcohol. And it’s quite easy to do, I have to say, because it is deemed socially acceptable – and it is everywhere. Mr Ure has now been sober for nine years and credits his family with helping him overcome his addiction . ‘It is not . until you try and give up you realise it is in every corner shop, it is . in garages, it is on the motorways, it is everywhere.’ The . Scottish musician’s heavy drinking spiralled into addiction after his . father’s death in 2001 and he claims that dealing with trauma can push . anyone over the edge. ‘It . is the very, very, very fine line between being able to deal with that . stuff and just falling over, and I kind of fell over for a little bit,’ he told BBC Radio Manchester. ‘And I was just quite shocked at how easy it was – to turn, for that to happen to anybody. And that’s not just me, you know, we’re all under huge amounts of pressure financially, socially, emotionally, all of that, so I think we’re all potentially very fragile.’ The father of four said that his family helped him to overcome his addiction and he has been sober now for nine years. As . well as having hits with Ultravox, Ure also enjoyed success in the . 1980s alongside Steve Strange in the band Visage and went on to produce . and co-write Band Aid’s Do They Know It’s Christmas? with Bob Geldof. This month he released a new album called Fragile, partly inspired by . his addiction experience. The . star, who has four daughters, one by first wife Annabel Giles and three . by his second, Sheridan Forbes, revealed previously that he will always . be tempted to drink but the thought of his family’s pain stops him. Tom, from Beaconsfield, was the first person to have a drink at Wetherspoons motorway pub . He . said: ‘The horrible thing about addiction is you think it is only . harming you, but it is not. Am I ever tempted to drink again? You always . are, it is the monkey on your shoulder. But what stops me doing it is . my family.’ In . January, Britain’s first motorway service station pub opened at . Beaconsfield services on the M40. The Wetherspoons branch served its . first customer a pint at 9.21am. Research . shows people consume more alcohol when it is easily available. A . Swedish study found consumption rose by 15 per cent when it was on sale . in grocery stores and dropped by the same amount when banned from the . shops.","Midge Ure's drinking spiralled into addiction after his father died in 2001 .

"Parents Glyn Rostron, 38, and Michelle Duffy, 32, (pictured outside Bolton Crown Court) both pleaded guilty to child cruelty . A couple have been spared jail because a court was unable to prove which of them broke their baby’s arm. Glyn Rostron, 38, and Michelle Duffy, 32, pleaded guilty to child cruelty for failing to seek medical help for their five-week-old son Thurston after his injury. But neither took responsibility for the ‘nasty fracture’ to his right arm. Handing them both a suspended jail sentence at Bolton Crown Court, Judge Timothy Clayson said: ‘One of you caused that injury and the two  of you put your own interests ahead of that of your son. ‘That is an attitude which is abhorrent to all right-minded people.’ Vanessa Thomson, prosecuting, told the court the baby was taken to A&E on December 1, 2012. Duffy told nurses he had not been moving his arm for a few days. X-rays revealed both bones in his lower arm were broken. Doctors concluded the injury could not have happened accidentally and the couple, from Bolton, were arrested. They told police that Rostron, a bakery worker, had been out ‘wetting the baby’s head’ when he got a call from his partner saying the little boy’s arm was floppy and he was unable to grab. They said that his mother took him to hospital later that evening. The couple said no one else had been alone with the baby and neither could offer any explanation for the injury. But on December 21, Rostron contacted a social worker and said  he may have caused the break two days before Thurston was taken  to hospital. He claimed he had accidentally knelt on the child’s arm as he lay on the bed during a night-time feed. Miss Thomson said that the account was unlikely to be true because doctors believed the injury had been caused by a direct blow or snapping force up to ten days before Thurston was taken to A&E. She said it would have been obvious that the baby was in pain. Jane Dagnall, defending, said Duffy is now considering having herself sterilised after Thurston and a second child, born last year, were taken into care. She told the court: ‘It is punishment that she has no children with her.’ Peter Cunliffe, for Rostron, said he was a hard worker with no previous convictions. Judge Clayson told the pair: ‘You will no longer have the pleasure of bringing up not only your young son, but also the other child. That is serious punishment indeed.’ He sentenced them both to five months’ imprisonment, suspended for 18 months. They will also be subject to six . months’ supervision, and must each pay £400 costs and a £100 victim . surcharge. CPS guidelines say the sentence for an assault on a child should be between 26 weeks and two years in jail. Bolton Crown Court (pictured) heard how Rostron, 38, and Duffy, 32, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, failed to seek immediate medical help for their five-week-old son Thurston after his arm was broken in two places . Kama . Melly, a barrister specialising in cases involving children, said if it . had been proved which parent had broken Thurston’s arm, they would have . been jailed.She added: ‘You would absolutely expect an immediate . custodial sentence for anyone who inflicted that sort of injury on a . defenceless child. ‘But in assaults on very young children, who are not able to speak, it is very hard to prove who did it.’ Last . year, a young mother who had refused to take medication for post-natal . depression was  spared prison after killing her  six-week-old daughter. Natasha Sultan, 21, struck Amelia-Lilly Sultan Curtis on the head after losing her temper while feeding her. She then went to bed instead of calling for an ambulance and later lied that she had tripped and dropped the baby. Hull . Crown Court heard she had been prescribed antidepressants but had taken . only  one because of the ‘stigma’ attached to post-natal depression. Sultan pleaded guilty to infanticide but instead of jail she was given a . three-year supervision order and was banned from working with children. The court heard any children she had in future would probably be taken . into care. Judge Jeremy Richardson QC said Sultan had been in a . ‘maelstrom of fatigue and mental disorder’. He told her: ‘Your actions . were not of a calculating cruel woman, rather, an uncontrolled explosion . born from a disturbance of mind associated  with childbirth.’","Glyn Rostron, 38, and Michelle Duffy, 32, pleaded guilty to child cruelty .

"A single mother on benefits accused of leaving a rented home with £2,000 worth of damage has claimed vandals kicked in the back door and ransacked the property after she left. Christine Lucas, 32, is accused of leaving a rented property in Blackpool with filthy carpets, obscene graffiti on the walls, and dog mess covering the yard. In two years, her family turned the . ‘immaculate’ three-bedroom terrace into a hovel, said . landlord Sean Feeney, 69. They knocked over furniture, ruined carpets . and left rotting food in the £140-a-week home, he claims, before moving to a council property. 'Disgusting': A single mother of two has been accused of leaving this Blackpool terrace in a terrible state - with rubbish strewn across the floor, rotting food all over the home and dog mess covering the back yard . Rubbish: The landlord of the three-bedroom home says Christine Lucas, 32, left graffiti (circled) scrawled across the walls of the £140-a-week home and piles of debris on the floor . Not to blame: Miss Lucas has today insisted she is not responsible for the mess - and says vandals broke in after she left and destroyed the home, which she left in a 'spotless' state . Mr Feeney said: . ‘They have vandalised it and left it in a sorry state, but the council . have given these people a brand new council house. 'I don’t know how . people can treat a property like this then get a new one. ‘This . lot behaved no better than a pack of wild animals. The carpet was so . filthy my feet stuck to the floor. 'They haven’t worked hard for anything . in the house so they have no respect for it.’ A . neighbour said: ‘She had a lot of people staying at the house and some . dogs. They had parties with noise at night and music blaring.’ But defiant Miss Lucas told the Mail last night she was not to be blamed. Filth: More rubbish in another of the rooms. Miss Lucas denies she was a 'dirty' tenant, and says the landlord refused to do repairs while she and her two children stayed in the property . Ruin: A wardrobe lies flat in one of the bedrooms. The former tenant says she is furious at what has been said about her and she is seeking legal advice . Instead, she insists, the mess was . caused by vandals who kicked in the back door after she and her  two . children aged seven and five, left. She . admitted being in rent arrears, which she said was due to her benefits . being cut, and claimed the landlord had failed to fix several problems . including leaks and damp. She said: ‘I’m a good person, I’ve got a heart of gold. I’m not happy with what’s been said about me.’ She claimed the only party she had held was a birthday party for the children which she had warned neighbours about. The family moved out on April 7 and came back the following day to tidy, leaving it ‘spotless’, she says. Mess: Mr Feeney says he will have to spend hundreds of pounds on the property to restore it to its former state. Miss Lucas has moved into a council house and is a full-time carer to her sick mother . Furious: Mr Feeney said of the property: 'They have vandalised it and left it in a sorry state, but the council have given these people a brand new council house. This lot behaved no better than a pack of wild animals' But the house was then burgled, she . said, and she was being falsely accused of breaking the door to the . electricity meter, writing graffiti in lipstick on the walls and burning . the dining room rug. She said: ‘Why would I do such a thing? I am really not happy about these false allegations and I am seeking legal advice. ‘I was a good tenant to start off with, until I fell behind with the rent, but I took out a £1,000 loan to pay off most of the arrears but the money was stolen from me. ‘I told the landlord about the repairs needing doing, but nothing was done. 'I even had the Environmental Health people out twice and they gave him time to get the repairs done, but they weren’t.’ 'I have a heart of gold': Miss Lucas, pictured outside her new home, admits she fell behind with rent. She says she was forced to take out a loan to pay off the arrears, but claims the money was stolen from her . Told that the landlord said she was a ‘dirty’ tenant, she said: ‘He was a dirty landlord. 'If he’d done the repairs I’d asked him to do, even though I was behind in the rent, I could have been there.’ Miss Lucas shares her newly-built new three-bedroom council house with her sick mother, who she cares for full time. Mr Feeney, a . retired builder, spent £5,000 renovating the property - but says . he will now have to pay hundreds more to repair the damage left behind . by Miss Lucas. Blackpool councillor Gillian Campbell said: ‘This shows how vitally important tenant referencing and background checks are.’","Christine Lucas, 32, accused of leaving property with £2,000 of damage .

"Sacked Manchester United manager David Moyes is to be questioned by police over claims he attacked another drinker outside an upmarket wine bar. Moyes, 51, allegedly erupted in a rage after he was subjected to a torrent of abuse as he arrived with friends. One drinker is said to have goaded him about his recent sacking by Manchester United. Scroll down for video . Investigation: Former Manchester United manager David Moyes is being probed by Lancashire police over an allegation of assault made by Joshua Gillibrand, a 23-year-old joiner . Witnesses say Moyes suddenly turned round and lunged at Joshua Gillibrand, hitting him on the side of the head. Last night Mr Gillibrand, 23, told The Sun: ‘He grabbed me around the neck and struck me in the back of the head. I ended up face down on the floor. ‘I felt I was going to die. There were tables flying everywhere and glass all over the place.’ Mr Gillibrand, a joiner, said he was treated for concussion and a bloody nose in hospital. Last night police confirmed they had launched an investigation and sources said they were set to speak to the former Premier League manager. The incident happened at around 10pm on Wednesday after Moyes and friends – including Derek Shaw, former chairman at Preston North End, one of Moyes’ previous clubs – had dined at Piccolino’s in Clitheroe, Lancashire, before going to the nearby Emporium wine bar. A group standing outside the bar began making abusive remarks when they saw Moyes, who was humiliatingly sacked as United manager last month after less than a year in charge and  is understood to have left with a £4.5million pay off. A witness said: ‘Moyes started to head in with his mates but he was being barracked by drinkers outside. ‘He was getting a bit of lip from a couple of blokes and then one guy, who was a bit drunk, said something about him being s*** and having never won anything. Wine Bar: The alleged incident is said to have taken place at the Emporium in Clitheroe, Lancashire . Reveller: Mr Gillibrand claims he was attacked at just after 10pm last night after an incident outside the bar. He did not require hospital treatment . ‘Moyes kept his head down and carried on walking towards the door with his friends and everyone thought he was just ignoring the banter. But then stopped, turned on his heels and quickly marched back.’ The man, who witnessed the end of the incident said: ‘Moyes had completely lost it and was bright purple in the face and quite clearly out of control. Out and about: David Moyes with wife Pamela in December . ‘No one could quite believe what had happened. We were stunned. He’s obviously had enough of all the abuse he’s been getting after his miserable season.’ Another witness, a 22-year-old man, said: ‘Josh was giving him banter, I think it might have been a chant about him leaving Manchester United, nothing very offensive, and initially Moyes just walked past him into the bar. ‘But moments later Moyes came back outside, squared up to Josh.' The witness, an acquaintance of Mr Gillibrand, added: ‘Josh is a well-built lad but he’s not  particularly mouthy, and he’s not really a football fan at all. 'I think he was too stunned at what had happened to react. ‘Josh was really angry about it, he was saying he wanted to take it further. ‘He was saying, “Whoa, I was only joking”. It’s amazing to think that someone who a few weeks ago was managing one of the world’s top football clubs was scuffling outside a bar on a Wednesday night in Clitheroe.’ Another friend of Mr Gillibrand said: ‘He was quite drunk and went up and said something to him like, “What are you doing around here?” ‘It didn’t go down at all well with Moyes who started swearing at him, so Josh said something like, “Well get out of town then”, and turned his back on him, which is when Moyes hit him in the back of the head.’ A police car was flagged down and officers dealt with the incident. Moyes was taken aside by the officers and spoken to. Mr Gillibrand’s mother Susan, 53, said her son had been shocked and had suffered a couple of bumps and bruises. She said: ‘Josh does not even like football.’ Last night Moyes, who lives near Preston, declined to comment over the incident. A spokesman for Lancashire Police said: ‘Officers attended the bar at about 10pm on Wednesday, May 21, and it was reported that a 23-year-old local man had been assaulted by a  51-year-old man. ‘Inquiries are ongoing and we are speaking to a number of people to try to establish the circumstances. No one has been arrested at this stage.’ Sacking: Mr Moyes was hand picked by Sir Alex Ferguson to succeed him as boss but lost his job at Old Trafford after nine months .","Moyes, 51, allegedly involved in a scuffle outside bar in Clitheroe at 10pm .

"Created: . 03:30 EST, 27 May 2014 . This is the moment a schoolboy carried out a light-hearted prank – and found himself at the centre of a police investigation. Year 13 pupil Jacob Dowdle lies in wait for his head of year, a custard pie in hand. It was the last day of term at Altrincham Grammar, when pupils are allowed to take playful revenge on their teachers who laugh it off and join in the fun. Scroll down for video . Prank: Jacob Dowdle moves backwards towards his female teacher with the custard pie in his hand . Impact: Dowdle pushes the face into his victim's face as a friend films the prank on his mobile phone . Aftermath: The teacher wipes the custard pie from her face, while still being filmed. After the incident, Dowdle was expelled from the school and quizzed by police . But when Jacob slapped the custard pie . – actually a plate of whipped cream – in the teacher’s face he did not . get the reaction from her he was expecting. She . reported him and a week later the 18-year-old was hauled to a police . station for questioning on suspicion of common assault. After being questioned by . Greater Manchester Police about his behaviour, he was told to apologise to the . teacher, Laura Barratt, 54. In trouble: Jacob Dowdle, 18, has been expelled from school and grilled by cops for throwing a custard pie at his teacher's face . But . after a video of the prank was posted on Facebook, Jacob was expelled . and allowed to return only to sit his A-Level exams. Part of the reason . for his expulsion was that he would not reveal who posted the footage . online. Fearing for his . university and job prospects, the star pupil has now launched an online . petition begging to be allowed back. The campaign has been backed by . comedian Jason Manford and attracted more than 750 signatures. Writing . on the petition, Jacob said: ‘During the last day of school – where it . is tradition to prank teachers – I pranked my head of year by pieing . them in the face with the traditional combination of a paper plate with . whipped cream on it; all as a prank and with no harm intended. ‘Other . teachers had been victims of pranks throughout the day so I thought . mine would go down in the same manner. The school treated the prank as . “common assault” and pursued to punish myself by means of contacting the . police. ‘There were other . pranks throughout the day, for example a student threw a water balloon . at a teacher and it exploded all over them. They went completely . unpunished.’ Furious teachers failed to see the funny side . and reported Jacob to the police before expelling him after finding a . video of the incident online . Jacob Dowdle, 18, was celebrating his last day of lessons when he grabbed the paper plate topped with whipped cream and threw it at the schoolmistress . Altrincham Grammar School for Boys, in Cheshire where Jacob Dowdle 'slapped' a female teacher's face with a custard pie during an end-of-term prank . Speaking to the Mail, Jacob said he regretted the prank but claimed the school’s response had been ‘disproportionate’. ‘Mrs . Barratt came out and the opportunity arose, my friends were egging me . on, so I just did it,’ he said. ‘But we’re not the best of  friends, . she’s just not got a sense of humour when it comes to me. I think that’s . why they’ve taken it that far.  If it was another pupil she liked she . would have reacted completely differently.’ Jason Manford has retweeted Jacob’s petition, calling the pie attack ‘p*** funny’. Two days after the incident Jacob, 18, was expelled by his school after a video of the pie attack was posted on Facebook . But the school maintains the incident on May 16 was a ‘planned assault’ on a teacher. Head . Tim Gartside said: ‘Like many schools we like to mark the end of Year . 13 and students have enjoyed clever, tasteful, and original pranks that . have neither harmed nor humiliated. ‘Jacob Dowdle’s behaviour was not . a prank. ‘His slapping of a teacher in the face was a planned assault.’ He said the school would always take a firm stance against students who assaulted staff.","Jacob Dowdle pushed fake 'custard pie' into his head of year's face .

"A former ballet teacher who died after a fall at home was given six doses of morphine shortly after her accident. Doreen Mannion, 85, who broke her leg when she slipped in January last year, possibly died due to ‘morphine intoxication’, a coroner said. The inquest was then adjourned so that a clinician who administered one of the doses could give evidence. Mrs Mannion received five doses of the painkiller from paramedics and a further dose soon after she arrived at Manchester Royal Infirmary (MRI) – a total of six in about 75 minutes. She had slipped as she went upstairs but had to lie on her hall floor waiting for an ambulance for two hours and 45 minutes, while her family tried to keep her warm. Tragic: Mrs Mannion, known to pupils as Miss Bardsley, in the 1940s and with her son Richard two years ago . They were afraid to move her in case she had broken her back. When paramedics finally arrived just after 2.30am, they gave her five 2.5mg doses of morphine in about 25 minutes, the inquest into her death in Manchester was told. Mrs Mannion was then taken to  the MRI, where a doctor gave her a further 10mg dose of the drug at 3.51am. She died two months later after weeks in intensive care. Mrs Mannion's son said they had a 'long and alarming' wait for an ambulance after she fell over at her home in Old Moat Lane, Manchester (pictured) Her son Richard, 63, a former NHS worker, told the inquest: ‘The wait didn’t do mother any good. She was on the cold  floor and we couldn’t keep her warm. It was the most long and alarming wait. ‘She went in with a broken leg which we thought was just a nuisance for her. Within 24 hours she was in a condition she would not recover from. Great efforts were made by everyone, including those at the MRI and paramedics, but something has happened.’ Coroner Sara Lewis said the amount of morphine the widow was given could have led to her death. ‘We have a lot of morphine over a short amount of time,  and we have a possible cause of death of morphine intoxication,’ she added. The inquest, at Manchester Town Hall (pictured), was adjourned until the doctor involved can give evidence . She adjourned the inquest as the doctor who had prescribed Mrs Mannion morphine in hospital was not there to answer her questions. Representatives from the hospital said they could not identify who the doctor was from the signature and there was no printed name on the form. ‘Given that this is a serious issue and the cause of death that has been offered includes morphine in it as a causation, we need more information on that,’ the coroner added. Mrs Mannion, who was known to pupils by her maiden name Miss Bardsley, toured with the Sadler’s Wells ballet company as a young girl and taught dance near her home in Withington,  Manchester, for about 30 years. Her husband, also called Richard, died in 1996. Speaking after the hearing, son Richard said: ‘I thought my mother would see me out. She was very independent. I would always find her up ladders and she still brought the coal for the fire up from the cellar. ‘She did her ballet exercises every day until well into her 70s. ‘I want to know what happened to her. We just want answers.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Doreen Mannion fell over at home in Manchester and broke her leg last year .

The aspiring glamour model, who has . never worked, now has her rent and council tax paid for by the state – . and spends much of the £1,000 monthly disposable income she gets on . nights out, clothes and five-star holidays to Turkey. Mr . Burke, 24, decided that living apart was not working and the couple . split after four years together. Now their two-year-old daughter and . Miss Clarke’s two children from previous relationships, aged 12 and . seven, are living without the father figure they all call ‘Dad’. Speaking . from her three-bedroom terraced council house in Middleton, Greater . Manchester, she told the Mail: ‘The children miss having him around but . they’re happy because they get to see him on weekends.’ In . an interview with Closer magazine, out this week, she said she had no . regrets about moving Mr Burke out of their home. Money: Portia Clarke (left) admitted asking her boyfriend Paul Burke (right) to move out . ‘Paul only earned £800 a . month at the factory, and by the time we’d paid rent we didn’t have . much left. I couldn’t buy myself nice clothes or go on holidays,’ she . said. Miss Clarke, whose . home contains expensive goods including a 50-inch TV and a leather-style . sofa, now receives a range of handouts including jobseeker’s allowance, . income support, child benefits and tax credits. She claims it is a better alternative to ‘flogging my guts out for low pay’ when she left beauty college at 18. After . falling pregnant with her first child she was given a council house and . £600 a month in benefits, which increased by £200 for her second child. After meeting Mr Burke she was reluctant for him to move in as it meant . paying council tax and rent and losing some housing benefit and income . support. She eventually agreed when she became pregnant with his child. The . couple got engaged but rowed about money, with Miss Clarke saying she . ‘resented’ that her benefits had been cut because of Mr Burke’s modest . income – even though it was enough to cover their £400 monthly . outgoings. ‘Paul wanted me . to get a job, but I knew I’d never find anything that paid decent . money,’ she added. ‘I asked Paul to get a better paid job, but he . couldn’t find anything, so I suggested he could move out and we could . carry on the relationship, but he wasn’t having any of it. ‘It . sounds heartless but my life is better now we’ve split and I’m back on . full benefits. I do miss Paul and the kids are sad that we’ve broken . up... I feel guilty but I know it’s for the best. Now I’m only going to . date men on benefits – life’s much easier that way.’ Mr . Burke told the magazine: ‘Portia’s very money-orientated and obsessed . with sponging off the system. I’ve worked since I left school at 16 and I . don’t want to live on benefits. ‘I was devastated when we split up – I just couldn’t see how we could move forward while living apart. ‘Now I’m happily single and focusing on the kids.’ A . spokesman for the Taxpayers’ Alliance said: ‘It’s no surprise people . are breaking up with their partners when there are financial incentives . to do so. The benefits system is full of loopholes and allowances. ‘It’s clear radical reform is needed to make sure this sort of abuse doesn’t become even more widespread.’","Portia Clarke, 34, admitted breaking up with her boyfriend Paul Burke, 24, .

"Paedophile: Jehovah's Witness elder Jonathan Rose, 40, was allowed to publicly cross-examine his victims at a meeting arranged by the church . A Jehovah's Witness elder who was convicted of abusing young girls was allowed to publicly cross-examine his victims at a meeting arranged by the church. Jonathan Rose, 40, was convicted of molesting the women when they were aged five and ten. He was jailed for nine months in October last year. But after his release the victims – who were members of his Jehovah’s Witness group – and a third woman were told that if they wanted him barred from the church they had to relive their ordeal in front of elders. Rose had previously been acquitted of abusing the third woman when she was a teenager – but the other two came forward after she branded him a paedophile on Facebook. Yesterday the Charity Commission said it had ‘ongoing serious concerns’ over the Manchester Moston Congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses’ child protection policies. Campaigners for the victims of child abuse described the treatment of the women – now in their 20s and 30s – as outrageous. Fay Maxted, of the Survivors’ Trust charity said the meetings showed ‘a complete lack of understanding of the impact of sexual abuse on a victim and of how a perpetrator might behave’. Three church meetings were held after Rose’s early release in March, when elders examined whether the joiner should be ‘disfellowshipped’. During the public meetings the women faced detailed questions about their abuse, were asked whether they encouraged it and, incredibly, whether they had enjoyed it. Rose was even allowed to question the women as eight elders looked on. A source, who asked not to be named, said: ‘Before each meeting, the women were read a scripture on false witnesses and told to consider it carefully. They had to go through the abuse in detail and were asked if they encouraged it. One was asked if she had enjoyed it. Traumatised: Rose's victims - who were members of his Jehovah's Witness group - and a third woman were told that if they wanted him barred from the church they had to relive their ordeal in front of elders (file picture) ‘At the third meeting, Rose was present. He questioned the women in detail with no one stepping in to stop bullying as would happen in court. ‘The victims had already done this in court, which elders attended.’ It is understood Rose, who is married with children, was finally ‘disfellowshipped’ after complaints to the police and Charity Commission. A spokesman for the Commission confirmed it had ‘serious concerns about the (congregation) in connection with its policies and procedures’. A Jehovah’s Witness spokesman said: ‘When a Jehovah’s Witness is accused of child abuse, local congregation elders are expected to investigate. ‘No victims are forced to attend a meeting or confront an alleged perpetrator of child abuse. Child abuse is abhorrent.’ John Cedars, a former Jehovah’s Witness who writes about the church under a false name, said: ‘The shocking incident illustrates perfectly how oblivious to the severity of child molestation the elders in (the) Moston congregation are.’ Jehovah’s Witnesses have been criticised for their policy that there must be two credible witnesses to a crime to establish guilt – based on a literal interpretation of the Bible.","Jonathan Rose, 40, was sentenced to nine months in jail in October 2013 .

"The son of a kayaker who died alongside his brother and cousin almost drowned in the same river two years ago, it was revealed today. Anthony, the son of Darren Thorpe, had been climbing by the River Tyne with his friends aged 12 when he slipped and plunged 25ft into the water below, banging his head on his way down. Knocked unconscious when he landed on a metal buoy in March 2012, Anthony was pulled to safety by his friends - but he was left with a fractured hip and pelvis and had six staples in his head.

Emergency . services were scrambled when the men did not return home to South . Tyneside on Sunday evening and three bodies were found hours later after . a search involving coastguards, police, firemen and an RAF helicopter. Police are investigating but there are no known witnesses and the truth of exactly what happened may never emerge. The . trio, who have not been named, had parked a car at Hexham, where they . started the river trip, and were planning to paddle 14 miles downstream . to reach a second car at Wylam. They . got about half way when tragedy struck. They are believed to have been . last seen at around noon on Sunday at a location near Corbridge known as . Devil’s Water, a tributary of the river.

Chief Superintendent Gordon Milward of Northumbria Police said: ‘We have two families completely distraught. It’s unimaginable.’ The . men had been on the river at least once before, he said, adding: ‘The . river was high, fast and deep.

Location: The two bodies were recovered in the River Tyne near Riding Mill, west of Newcastle-upon-Tyne . ‘We don’t yet know the standard of their kayaking and what their physical capability was.’ Police . have no idea whether all three kayaks were thrown into the water as a . result of the conditions or if one or two of the men went in to rescue . another and drowned in the process. 'We will miss him. I am devastated, I cried myself when I found out and when I told my daughter she had a few tears and then my son' Neighbour of Darren Thorpe . A . member of a local canoe club said: ‘The kayaks they had are known as . “sit on top” kayaks and are generally associated with leisure kayakers.

"Malakai Fekitoa crossed three seconds from full time and Colin Slade converted to give the New Zealand All Blacks a 29-28 win in the last Bledisloe Cup test of the series on Saturday, inflicting more pain on the embattled Wallabies. New Zealand had already retained the Bledisloe Cup with a thumping 51-20 win in Auckland following the 12-12 draw in Sydney at the start of the Rugby Championship, but was behind for most of the match in Brisbane and were on the cusp of losing back-to-back tests for the first time in three years.

Australia had 10-point cushions twice - and had a one-man advantage for 10 minutes in the second half when Patrick Tuipulotu was in the sin bin - but couldn't sustain it. The Australians led 15-12 at the break after a see-sawing half featuring two tries for each team. The Wallabies scored in the 12th and the 39th minutes, with halves Nick Phipps and Bernard Foley darting over from the back of rucks on the tryline. The All Blacks responded immediately to the first try, regaining possession from the kick restart and spreading it right for Corey Jane, who slid over inside the post to level the scores. After turning down three shots at goal, Foley landed a penalty to give the Australians a 10-7 lead in the 32nd but it only took three minutes for the All Blacks to hit the front for the first time when hooker Dane Coles embarrassed the defense by throwing a dummy near the left sideline in the attacking quarter and angling back infield to score untouched. The lead changed hands again just before the break when the Australians, after a series of one out hitups, went to the left corner where Hooper drew in the two outside defenders and went to ground a meter out, allowing Foley to reach out for the try. Ashley-Cooper crossed just after halftime in his milestone 100th test, giving the hosts a 22-12 lead after some sustained attack and a strong, bumping run from Tevita Kuridrani. Beauden Barrett and Foley traded penalties to make it 25-15 in the 58th before Tuipulotu was sin-binned for dangerous tackle on a player in the air, taking out Wallabies lock Rob Simmons as he jumped to take the kick restart.

Replacement scrumhalf Nic White kicked a long-range penalty goal to give the Australians a six-point lead which appeared to be enough until the last minute when center Fekitoa sliced through the stretched defense in midfield and dived over on the right. Replacement Slade had no difficulty with the conversion, capping another successful southern winter for the All Blacks. Both teams head to Europe for tours, with Australia unsure about the makeup of its squad.
